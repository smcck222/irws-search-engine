It sounds like a parent's nightmare: A first-grader with a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone seems happy with the Glendale Unified School District's unique 
system of having parents prepay $20 for a bar-coded plastic card that entitles 
their children to 20 lunches. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, a lot of parents were tired of hunting around for $1.25 (the cash 
price of a lunch) at the last minute each morning as their child was going out 
the door," said Rick De Burgh, the district's director of food services. 
</P>
<P>
The system, aside from allowing the district to keep computerized records for 
the federal government's subsidy program, also speeds up the cafeteria lines. 
More than 1,000 children use the cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids that age love to wad up the the dollar bill into the smallest piece 
possible around the quarter," said De Burgh. "We even had one kid who would 
tape the wad to his quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The district is also aware that kids have been known to lose things. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep the cards in a box five feet from the (cafeteria) line," De Burgh 
said. The cards go back into the box after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Glendale's version of the American Express slogan would be: 
"Don't leave the cafeteria with it." 
</P>
<P>
We mentioned the other day that a Hollywood attorney has been asked by Parker 
Bros., the makers of Monopoly, to stop using business cards bearing "Get Out of 
Jail Free" designs. 
</P>
<P>
No chance, says the 66-year-old attorney, Jack Deitsch. He maintains that the 
courts have held that the drawings on the Monopoly cards were used years before 
the game was invented and are "in the public domain." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the courts have told Deitsch, "Pass Go." 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Compton Fire Department experimented with all-water bed sleeping 
accommodations in its four station houses. 
</P>
<P>
It was part of a study aimed at determining whether firefighters could get back 
to sleep easier on those surfaces than on standard mattresses after a middle of 
the night call. The results are in, and the 40 water beds are staying. On 
standard beds, 30% of the firefighters reported it was "very difficult" falling 
asleep again. With water beds, just 7% complained of sleeplessness. 
</P>
<P>
An all water bed fire department is, by the way, another first for L.A.

BIG RATE HIKE FOR ASSIGNED-RISK CAR INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Assigned-Risk Rates to Rise Average of 85%," Sept. 20: 
</P>
<P>
Now that my auto insurance is being raised from $575 to $1,000 per year (I have 
assigned-risk insurance because my car is old, 1965 model), I suppose I should 
jump for joy for getting a discount from the insurance companies when they get 
both feet in the door with good old no-fault. No way. 
</P>
<P>
I'm going to give myself a 100% discount; no more insurance until the state 
gives me affordable insurance. I would like to see the state add an insurance 
fee ($200) to the license fee on every vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
This probably will never happen because it would be asking our politicians to 
put their hands back in their own pockets.

Henderson's column is an outstanding example of illogical reasoning, flawed 
comparisons and distortions. 
</P>
<P>
Consider just one: "While the state requires everyone to carry insurance 
(liability only), it has to make sure everyone can afford coverage." Why? 
Driving a vehicle is a privilege, not a constitutional right. 
</P>
<P>
If one elects to steer a 3,000-pound vehicle, a lethal weapon, that person has 
the moral as well as legal obligation to monetarily care for victims of a 
driver's error. And the government should not subsidize such insurance or allow 
driving without coverage.

CONTROVERSY OVER BOOK ON MOSSAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to your report (Part A, Sept. 14), the Appellate Division of the New 
York Supreme Court has dismissed a stay issued by a lower court judge, which 
had been sought by the Israeli government on the grounds that publication of a 
book, "By Way of Deception," would endanger the lives of members of Mossad, its 
intelligence agency. The work, authored by Victor Ostrovosky, a former member 
of Mossad, who had been dismissed because of his unreliability, is being 
published. 
</P>
<P>
Certain people will see in this an opportunity to have a field day. Alexander 
Cockburn, your far-left, Jew-hating, Israel-bashing columnist, has been one of 
the first (Commentary, Sept. 14). 
</P>
<P>
Let us suppose that a dismissed, former American CIA agent writes a book in 
which he accuses the U.S. of various actions harmful to Israel, and in which he 
names and thereby endangers the lives of secret CIA agents stationed in various 
parts of the world. He then goes to Israel and there has it published and 
distributed. Can you possibly imagine the uproar that would be directed against 
Israel? 
</P>
<P>
One of Ostrovosky's accusations is that Israel withheld from the United States 
information it had obtained regarding the planned Arab attack in Beirut in 
1983, which took 241 American lives. Such a charge is absurd. About the same 
time, an Israeli installation in Southern Lebanon was also bombed with great 
loss of life. Over the years, Israeli intelligence has transmitted to the 
United States hundreds of pieces of vital intelligence information worth tens 
of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Every rogue is now trying to cash in on the false notion that because of the 
end of the Cold War, Israel is no longer of importance as a strategic American 
ally. Hopefully, they will not succeed. The alliance should remain intact.

I am outraged that Arabist Cockburn can be given so much space and legitimacy 
to spout his longstanding total hatred of Israel.

He is not "Column Left," but "Column Hate." 
</P>
<P>
How strange it is that at this moment of American crisis we should have such a 
concentration on the supposed duplicity of Israel. Does one have to be an 
expert to detect the Arabs' secret weapon? Make Israel the secret culprit and 
the enemy of America.

BIG RATE HIKE FOR ASSIGNED-RISK CAR INSURANCE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with Rick Henderson's position ("So Let Them Drive Without Car 
Insurance," Commentary, Sept. 25) that motorists should not be required by law 
to purchase auto insurance. But I would go one step further. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that the tort system be changed so that in any personal injury or 
property-damage lawsuit involving an automobile accident, the plaintiff's 
recovery would be limited to an amount equaling the policy limits of his or her 
own automobile coverage. For example, a plaintiff owning a policy with $15,000 
policy limits could only obtain a judgment of $15,000 or less. A plaintiff with 
$300,000 policy limits could obtain a judgment of $300,000 or less. And a 
plaintiff with no insurance would be unable to recover anything. 
</P>
<P>
Under this proposed system, no motorist could draw from the insurance pool any 
more than he or she puts into it by way of paying premiums. The amount of 
premiums dollars going into the insurance pool in California would not change, 
but the amount being drawn out would be drastically reduced as a result of 
fewer and smaller claims. The savings, in a competitive insurance market, 
should be passed on to the consumer in the way of lower premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Under our present system, uninsured motorists as a group are certainly willing 
to go to the courts to recoup their losses when the are injured by an insured 
motorist. But when the tables are turned, they are usually judgment-proof. The 
ones left holding the bag are insured motorists.

CRUSH IRAQI WAR POWER OR NO DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
GULF: PRESSURES ARE MOUNTING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN THAT LEAVES THE 
THREAT TO ISRAEL AND U.S. INTERESTS INTACT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The real danger in the Persian Gulf crisis is that there will be a phony 
settlement because of internal and external pressures on President Bush to 
avoid war at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures are ominously reminiscent of the urgings in Britain and France in 
1938 that Adolf Hitler be offered a way out of the 1938 Munich crisis. The 
Anglo-French appeasement of Hitler was a fatal mistake then and a deal with the 
Iraqi dictator would be equally wrong now. 
</P>
<P>
Any deal will leave untouched the basic threat -- the Iraqi war machine, which 
now includes ballistic missiles with chemical nerve-gas warheads and biological 
weapons. And Hussein is aggressively seeking nuclear weapons. The only way to 
remove this threat to the United States and its allies, including Israel, is to 
destroy Iraq's war capability. 
</P>
<P>
The sorts of two-stage settlements being floated in Washington by Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III and others are superficially attractive but 
unworkable. Stage 1 would be a face-saving Arab deal to pay off Hussein in 
traditional Middle Eastern style. He would withdraw from Kuwait in return for 
money, oil wells and territory. Stage 2 would be the creation of a Middle East 
alliance to contain Hussein, including the United States, Iraq's neighbors and 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein would jump at such a deal. Having gambled and lost that he could get 
away free with annexing all of Kuwait, he needs to strike the next-best 
available deal. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hitler in 1938, Hussein may graciously agree to be paid off with other 
countries' resources and territories. He could afford to let a cowed and 
compliant Sabah family return to rule Kuwait, just as Syrian President Hafez 
Assad leaves obsequious puppets in Lebanon's presidential palace. Hussein's 
standing would soar in the Arab world and he would be hailed as the greatest 
Muslim leader since Saladin. Then he could select his next victim -- perhaps 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with this danger, the State Department proposes a regional security 
organization based on a long-term U.S. military presence and American-Arab 
cooperation and burden-sharing. On paper, such an arrangement seems ideal. But 
to credibly contain Iraq's untouched and growing power, the organization would 
have to include Iran and Syria. It is hard to believe that they would join. 
Even if they did, U.S. public opinion would have a hard time accepting them as 
allies and Congress would never approve arming them. Assad is, after all, a 
Junior League version of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Second, while a long-term, major U.S. military commitment to the region would 
be necessary, it would be counterproductive if it involved a large, highly 
visible American presence. British and Soviet experience in the Middle East 
shows that the visible presence of what Arabs see as infidels attracts intense 
nationalist and religious hostility and delegitimizes the host governments. 
Hussein, like Gamal Abdel Nasser in the early 1950s, could turn such Arab 
resentment to his advantage, consolidating his role as the hero of pan-Arabism 
and able to use terrorism to deadly effect against U.S. personnel. The United 
States and its allies cannot offer Hussein a way out without fatally 
compromising their security in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, a U.S.-led multinational military offensive could succeed where a 
regional security alliance would fail. A military alliance would have a clear, 
common objective: the swift destruction of Saddam's war machine. And overall 
U.S. leadership, based on its massive military contribution, could coordinate 
the diverse British, French and Arab units into an overwhelming force. 
</P>
<P>
The unpalatable truth is that the only effective solution to the threat is the 
physical destruction of Hussein's military power. Anything less would mean, as 
Winston Churchill warned in 1938, that unchecked aggression will be "the first 
foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year."

WARFARE: THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE CAN BE FATAL.

<P>
Kut-al-Amara, Cold Harbor, the Somme. All sites of major battles that ought to 
strike at least a note of caution into the minds of those unnamed "high-ranking 
policy-makers, senior military officials, U.S. government analysts and others" 
who are calling for an immediate military offensive against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But those past battles obviously have no meaning to them, for war to those 
pundits is a bloodless abstraction, not an actual clash of arms where rash and 
ill-considered actions can have catastrophic results. 
</P>
<P>
For those men and women who would actually have to make such an assault, 
however, and for their commanders, those battles have real meaning. They warn 
of the consequences of not thinking about the unthinkable -- the fact that 
defeat is always a battlefield possibility. In war, hubris -- underestimating 
your enemy and failing to take his strength and dispositions into account -- 
can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Cold Harbor, thanks to the recent magnificent PBS series on the Civil War, is 
probably the best known of these battles. As historian Shelby Foote tells it, 
in the Union Army's frontal assault on Confederate breastworks at Cold Harbor 
in Virginia on June 3, 1864, "Grant lost better than 7,000 (killed and 
wounded), most of them in the course of the first eight minutes." 
</P>
<P>
And at the first battle of the Somme in World War I, the slaughter was even 
worse. British Gen. Henry Rawlinson, the Gen. Michael J. Dugan of his time, 
believed that war could be won with firepower alone. 
</P>
<P>
In Dugan's case it was air bombardment. It can so shatter enemy resistence in 
Kuwait, he said last month, that soldiers "can walk in and not have to fight." 
</P>
<P>
In Rawlinson's case, it was artillery. Some 1,437 British guns fired 1,508,652 
shells into the German lines in the five-day bombardment preceding the attack. 
"You can go over the top with a walking stick," the infantrymen were told. "You 
will not need rifles." 
</P>
<P>
But when the attack jumped off on the morning of July 1, 1916, the German 
defenses had not been neutralized. The British Army took 57,470 casualties on 
the first day alone, including 19,240 killed in action, most of them in the 
first 30 minutes of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Iraq is good at is defense of prepared positions, for 95% of its 
battles during the eight-year war with Iran were fought on the tactical 
defensive. The Iranians lost soldiers by the hundreds of thousands in fruitless 
assaults and finally had to sue for peace. 
</P>
<P>
One of war's unintended consequences is defeat, as the British army also found 
in an earlier attempt to capture Baghdad. The battle of Kut-al-Amara in April, 
1916, is not well-known, but it provides compelling lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Initially sent to the area in 1914 to protect access to Persian Gulf oil, the 
British force prematurely went over to the offensive in October, 1915. Under 
the command of Maj. Gen. Sir Charles Townshend, the troops set off to capture 
Baghdad, then part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Forced back by a determined 
Turkish defense, the expedition was besieged at Kut-al-Amara on the Tigris 
River, about 180 air miles short of its objective. On April 29, 1916, Townshend 
capitulated. 
</P>
<P>
"To reach Kut cost Townshend 7,000 casualties," wrote military critic Norman 
Dixon. "During the ensuing siege a further 1,600 died; attempts to relieve his 
force accounted for another 23,000 casualties; when he eventually surrendered 
to the Turks, 13,000 of his troops went into captivity and of these 7,000 died 
while still prisoners of war. All this went for nothing, not one inch of ground 
or any political advantage." 
</P>
<P>
It was a mistake the United States is not liable to repeat.Civilian and 
military leaders who have the ultimate authority to commit American forces to 
combat have been thinking about the unthinkable. That's one way to ensure that 
the unthinkable never comes about.

Today the German Democratic Republic will formally merge into the Federal 
Republic of Germany. The population of the Federal Republic will jump from 62 
million to 79 million and the territory will grow by more than 44%. Given the 
size of this new, united Germany and our terrible history, it is not surprising 
that many people have mixed feelings about this reunification. Can the Germans 
be trusted not to repeat the past? Is democracy rooted deeply enough to prevent 
return to a totalitarian regime? Will the Germans fall back into excessive 
nationalism and try to dominate Europe? I don't believe so. The experiences of 
my generation of Germans -- those of us born during and immediately following 
World War II -- offer reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
My first lesson in the evils of a totalitarian state began early in life. I was 
born in Trautenau in the Czechoslovakian Sudetenland on May 7, 1944. On that 
day, my father, a member of Hitler's Reichswehr, was steering an army truck a 
thousand miles to the east in the Ukraine. Father and son did not see each 
other for 12 years; within months of my birth my father was taken prisoner by 
the Soviets, sentenced to 25 years in a labor camp and sent to Vorkuta in the 
northern Ural Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
As the war ended, my mother, my three sisters and I -- then a year old -- 
became part of the long westward trek of 12 million German refugees from the 
eastern provinces. With only the clothes on our backs, we were sent to 
Weissandt in newly created East Germany, a region now infamous for decades of 
environmental neglect. 
</P>
<P>
We lived in one room of a farmhouse, refugees in an impoverished land. Walter 
Ulbricht's East German government classified prisoners of war held by "our 
Soviet friends" as criminals, rendering families such as mine ineligible for 
financial support, public housing or access to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Konrad Adenauer's efforts, all German prisoners were to be 
released from the Soviet Union in late 1955. Leaving my sisters behind in East 
Germany, my mother and I hurried to the expected reunion with my father in 
Herleshausen, West Germany. We stayed several weeks, watching each transport 
arrive and unload. But my father was not among the men released. Six months 
later, we learned that those classified as war criminals had been sent to 
Bautzen, in East Germany. After another month, in May, 1956, my father finally 
joined my mother and me in the West; several months later, the East German 
authorities allowed my sisters to join us. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of other German families endured similarly long separations, loss and 
grinding poverty after the defeat of Hitler. I do not compare our sufferings 
with the millions of victims of the Third Reich. But I know that my generation 
of Germans has personal knowledge of the horrible consequences of an aggressive 
war and of totalitarian regimes. I want to ensure that my daughter will never 
repeat my experiences. 
</P>
<P>
If my childhood education in the evils of aggressive nationalism is not unique, 
my career as a political scientist in the field of international relations has 
given me an unusual opportunity to observe the political lessons our democratic 
government has learned over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like my career, my country's fate is also linked to the European Community, an 
institution that has proved that excessive nationalism can be held in check by 
regional integration and self-restraint. Germany is an integral part of this 
community of states; we have not tolerated territorial expansion by force or 
coercion. We know that the Wirtschaftswunder was no wonder but hard work in a 
democratic environment guaranteed by a strong Western alliance. We remember 
well that only six short years passed from Munich in 1938 to a world in 
shambles in 1944, when I was born. 
</P>
<P>
Mine is the generation, born in the 1940s and 1950s, that will run a united 
Germany well into the next century. Precisely because we have witnessed the 
catastrophic results of aggressive war and subsequent authoritarian regimes, we 
will not jeopardize the advantages of our democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Our task will not be an easy one; unification will test our new stability in 
many ways. Can we develop a society open to immigration? Can we lead the 
process of European economic unification without dominating it? Can we shoulder 
global security responsibilities without sliding into power politics? Can we do 
these things while absorbing 17 million new citizens and a host of new 
environmental, social and economic problems? 
</P>
<P>
In the last 40 years. German democracy has survived many tests: the massive 
immigration from the East in the late 1940s, rearmament in the 1950s, the 
emergency laws in the 1960s, terrorism in the late 1970s, severe economic 
recession in the early 1980s. It is now my generation's turn to accept a new 
set of challenges. We face them well-schooled in the advantages of democracy. 
We embrace them, not as a means of building a more powerful Germany, but as a 
way to play a constructive, peaceful role in a new and more dynamic Europe. We 
deserve the benefit of the doubt.

High-Class Strike: Fifth Avenue in New York is the scene of a high-profile rent 
strike. Alistair Cooke, host of PBS's "Masterpiece Theater," former New Yorker 
Editor William Shawn and Philippe de Montebello, head of the Metropolitan 
Museum, are among those withholding rent in an apartment building, charging the 
landlord with poor upkeep. 
</P>

The building's owners, seeking to convert it to a co-op, say the renters are 
merely resisting changes.

Regrets: British author Salman Rushdie said in London he was sorry if his novel 
"The Satanic Verses" offended Muslims and that their rejection of him was a 
harsher punishment than his 18 months in hiding. "The book did not set out (to 
inflict) insult and abuse," said Rushdie, who went into hiding after the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran's spiritual leader, ordered Muslims to 
kill the author for alleged blasphemy in "The Satanic Verses."

Early Out: A car dealer has offered Nashville, Tenn., Mayor Bill Boner $75,000 
to resign. But Boner was busy in Hawaii, where he reportedly was getting 
married Monday. "Bill Boner is distracted from his job," businessman Lee Beaman 
said. Nashville residents gasped when Boner, 45, announced his engagement to 
Traci Peel, 34, while he was still married to his third wife. The Nashville 
Banner quoted Peel as saying the mayor's passion could last seven hours. A 
Boner spokesman said he knew nothing of Beaman's offer.

In Your Face: Motorists along I-196 just west of Grand Rapids, Mich., are 
confronted with a huge billboard depicting Iraq President Saddam Hussein. On 
either side of Saddam's face are the words "Crude Dude." And just to make sure 
the pun is clear, thick, black liquid that looks like oil seems to drip from 
the word Crude. The billboard is the latest work of Mark Heckman, 27, a local 
artist.

JACK SMITH: WOMEN FIND COMBAT ON THE SOIL OF THEIR HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not surprised by the number and anger of the letters I have received 
denouncing my belief that women should not be used in combat. 
</P>
<P>
Though most of them accuse me of sexism (which I admitted), most of them are 
outrageously sexist themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They scorn my notion that most men have deep-seated feelings of chivalry and 
tenderness toward women, and could not bear to see them mangled, stripped and 
bloodied on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that men habitually rape and batter women, noting that the National 
Organization for Women says that one out of three women is raped or battered. I 
despise rapists, but I find it hard to believe that one out of every three 
women is destined to be raped or battered. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragic irony of it," writes Barbara L. Gallen, "is that we face an 
epidemic of male-perpetrated violence against women in this country. . . . This 
is hardly the time to rationalize an archaic double standard that prohibits 
qualified women from assuming responsibility for defending their own, and their 
country's well-being." 
</P>
<P>
(I should think a country that permits assaults on one-third of its women has 
no well-being to defend.) 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Smith . . . excuses his sexist attitude because 'it has to do with men's 
chivalry,' " writes Fran Ferguson of Palm Desert. "How does this chivalry hold 
up in the light of the violence and abuse suffered by women at the hands of men 
worldwide? The number of women who are brutalized and raped grows each year and 
a sexist attitude, whether perceived as benevolent chivalry or open 
discrimination, plays a part in its perpetuation. No one wants more mangled 
bodies as a result of combat duty -- male or female. Smith's postion 
restricting women from combat is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
What is the answer? 
</P>
<P>
"I, too, like you, oppose women being used in combat," writes Linda Alkana of 
Seal Beach, "but I think your argument is weak. Men's 'deep-seated tenderness 
and chivalry toward women' do not preclude them from killing women with the 
bombs they drop, nor raping them nor using them as prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
"Chivalry, shmivalry, Mr. Smith," writes S. Marlene Head of Oxnard. ' 
"Deep-seated tenderness' toward women, my ---." She goes on to assert that men 
who might be unhinged by the sight of women combat victims would have no 
trouble "raping, killing and maiming unarmed civilian women." 
</P>
<P>
"No," writes Kim Foreman of San Bernardino, "I don't think you're sexist for 
feeling that women shouldn't be used in combat (a very good choice of words, by 
the way), but I do think you are very naive. . . . Quite the opposite is true. 
Out of the hundreds of thousands of men facing combat, surely a good deal of 
them have seen and enjoyed pornography, which shows women being beaten, tied 
up, whipped, tortured and degraded in any number of ways. Surely many of them 
have maimed or injured a girlfriend and spouse, knocking them around in a fit 
of anger or drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that seeing women as a comrade-in-arms, fighting and even dying 
alongside the men, would bring about a profound change in attitude in those men 
who witnessed it. I think they would learn to see women as having courage, 
dignity and worth in their own right. . . . Facing death together, facing a 
common threat, creates a bond, a closeness and trust that even years of 
marriage can't duplicate. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Believe me, seeing a comrade mangled by a mortar shell does not invest him with 
courage, dignity and worth. Death on the battlefield is obscene. 
</P>
<P>
At least Foreman admits that she is not volunteering. "Personally, I'm a coward 
and would only put my life on the line for my family or myself, but I know many 
women are just as willing as men to put themselves in the line of fire for a 
cause they believe in." 
</P>
<P>
"That combat is somehow alien to the supposedly nurturant, life-preserving 
tendencies of women insidiously reinforces biologically determined constructs 
of gender," writes Sikivu Hutchinson in prose that sounds like a doctoral 
dissertation. "To deny women combat roles more firmly enshrines oppressive 
boundaries between 'masculine and feminine,' marking women as part of the 
substrata (i.e., women and children) of those least powerful and most needy of 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that persons who are routinely raped and beaten by men are needy 
of protection. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Kim Foreman, who admitted she is not keen about combat, none of my 
correspondents indicates whether she is eager to engage in combat, should the 
armed forces open it to women. As someone has pointed out, "War hath no fury 
like a non-combatant." 
</P>
<P>
I have not quoted from any letters supporting my view. My view is personal and 
emotional, and is based on experience. I doubt that it can be reinforced by 
logic or rational argument. 
</P>
<P>
Battle stations, everyone.

ANN CONWAY: TAKING STEPS TO THANK NEW YORK CITY BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is Belmont!" Peter Martins said, laughing. The New York City Ballet's 
master-in-chief was comparing his company to a stable of racehorses, the same 
way he did when they appeared in Costa Mesa four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was George Balanchine -- founder of the NYCB -- who originated the 
comparison, said the Danish-born Martins (devastatingly handsome in black tie). 
"Racehorses are very strong animals with fine, slender legs and small ankles. 
One misstep, and it's over!" 
</P>
<P>
Martins was among 200 guests kicking up their heels at the Westin South Coast 
Plaza on Sunday night after the company's final performance at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet master swept into the gala fashionably late and took his place near 
Center President Thomas Kendrick at the A table, next to the dance floor. Also 
joining Martins for a sit-down dinner was ballerina Kyra Nichols, Center 
General Manager Judy Morr and ballet buffs Elaine and Bill Redfield. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Center Dance Alliance -- a Center support group -- staged the 
bash, which for $150 per person included dining, dancing and the chance to rub 
elbows with some of the country's most brilliant dancers. A steal. 
</P>
<P>
Its theme was Stars and Stripes Gala, after a work choreographed by Balanchine 
to music by John Philip Sousa. The party saw guests waxing ecstatic over the 
dancers and the dancers waxing ecstatic over the chance to perform again in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's lovely being here," said Alexandre Proia, a Paris-born dancer. Proia said 
he planned to do some social dancing at the party. How did he compare social 
dancing to ballet? No comparison. "Ballet is art," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Art indeed. Act III featured "Vienna Waltzes," with music by Johann Strauss. 
For this sequence, the stage at Segerstrom Hall featured a mirrored backdrop 
and gigantic shimmering snowflakes suspended from the ceiling. The beautiful 
ballerinas whirled about in billowing white satin gowns, escorted by dashing 
men in black tie. Breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
Even ballerina Jenifer Ringer, 17, was still starry-eyed over appearing in the 
number. "Doing that dance fulfills the dream," Jenifer said, "the dream of 
dressing up and dancing with a very handsome man." 
</P>
<P>
Ballerina Jennifer Fuchs, 21, was featured in the "Explosions -- Polka" 
sequence, also by Strauss. "It was fun," she said. "When I dance in it, I can't 
stop smiling. You hope you're on the music, because it's so fast!" 
</P>
<P>
Gala chairwoman Martha Morgan dressed up the hotel ballroom with long-stem red 
rose bouquets and gold-edge black ribbon. Gold stars were scattered across each 
table. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want a literal interpretation of the Stars and Stripes," Morgan 
said, noting the party's elegant red, gold and black theme.

NEW AND USEFUL: RECYCLING SYSTEM HELPS SORT HOUSEHOLD ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Recycling File System can provide an easy way to sort and store recyclable 
items -- paper, glass and aluminum -- at home or at the office. 
</P>
<P>
The file consists of three reusable vinyl storage bags hanging from a 
17x18x27-inch white PVC rack. The bags easily slide out of the rack so they can 
be carried to curbside or a recycling center. One bag is leak resistant; the 
other two are mesh. All are washable and come in a choice of white, black, 
gray, blue or dark green. 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $69.95, including shipping and handling, the system is available 
through the Nature Company stores and catalogue; HOLD-IT stores in San Diego 
and Carlsbad. If you can't find them in your area, contact the manufacturer, 
Bring Your Own Bag (BYBO), P.O. Box 289, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Calif. 92007; 
(800) 334-BYOB. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handy Holders for Heating Tortillas 
</P>
<P>
Just introduced are Tortilla Pockets, round cloth holders that are handy for 
heating tortillas in a microwave, or keeping them warm if you heat them the 
traditional way, on the stove top or griddle. 
</P>
<P>
The washable pockets, 9 1/2 inches in diameter, also can be used for rolls and 
pita bread. One pocket holds up to a dozen corn or flour tortillas, or six 
rolls or pita breads. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Kitchen Gear &amp; More in Visalia, Tortilla Pockets come in white 
muslin with red, yellow, blue or green trim, or in eight floral prints in 
cotton/polyester. 
</P>
<P>
The holders are available, for $6.99, in most Friedman's Microwave Ovens stores 
in Northern, Central and Southern California. Locally, you can find them at 
Friedman's in Pasadena, Orange and Long Beach. Or you can order them from 
Kitchen Gear &amp; More, P.O. Box 1943, Visalia, Calif. 93279; (209) 732-8281. 
They're $6.99, including shipping and handling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto Sleeve Puts Beverages on the Go 
</P>
<P>
Tired of trying to balance your coffee cup on the car seat while driving? 
Consider Mobile Mate, a new beverage holder for autos and trucks. It's suitable 
for cups, cans and bottles, even big 32-ounce containers. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a car with a 5-inch armrest, the Mobile Mate sleeve -- with a 3 
5/8-inch cup holder -- will fit snugly over it. If your car's armrests are 
narrower, the unit comes with foam fillers so the sleeve will fit properly. 
</P>
<P>
For cars without armrests, the Texas developer of Mobile Mate manufactures a 
plastic adapter that the sleeve slips over. The holder is made of 
Velour-covered foam and comes in burgundy, blue, gray, tan or black. It is not 
adaptable for cars with bucket seats. 
</P>
<P>
The standard Mobile Mate costs $10.95, plus $2.50 shipping and handling. With 
the adapter unit, it's $13.95, plus $2.50 shipping and handling. To order, 
contact Mobile Mate Inc., 628 Franklin St., DeSoto, Tex. 75115; (800) 421-3106.

FATHER AND CHILD REUNION; 
</P>
<P>
SHARED DREAM BECOMES REALITY AFTER 22-YEAR SEPARATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 22 years, Arthur S. Miller searched for his daughter Natalie. He hired 
private detectives. He called the FBI. He sent letters with a simple plea to 
his former wife, who had taken the girl away. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, just let me see my daughter," the Oxnard businessman begged. 
</P>
<P>
There was no response. The letters were returned, address unknown. Seeing her 
again seemed out of reach -- until last month, when Miller's daughter, Natalie 
Hobbelen, now 26, found him after traveling halfway around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock," Miller said. "Twenty-two years passed before my eyes. It's 
absolutely awesome. To this moment, I'm the happiest man alive." 
</P>
<P>
Every year, thousands of children disappear. Many are pawns in bitter marital 
battles. Some are reunited with their fathers or mothers. Others are not. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Hobbelen consider themselves lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was a girl I would dream about my father," Hobbelen said. "I 
would imagine how he would look, what he was like. He's everything I thought he 
would be and more. It's a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
When Hobbelen was 2, her parents divorced and she was moved by her mother from 
their home in Granada Hills to Northern California. For a couple of years, 
Miller was allowed to see the child. 
</P>
<P>
Then Hobbelen's mother remarried and, without warning, she moved with her 
daughter and new husband to Australia. They left no forwarding address. Other 
family members were told not to tell Miller where they had gone. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a friend in the FBI, Miller tracked his daughter to Australia. 
He located her twice with the help of other federal officials, but his ex-wife 
moved both times as soon as she received letters from Miller asking to see his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
His next step was to hire an Australian attorney, who spent 18 months searching 
for the family before again locating them. But as soon as Miller had sent 
another letter, his ex-wife moved again. 
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, there were other detectives and other attempts to 
reach his daughter. Miller finally tracked her once again and sent another 
letter to his ex-wife at yet another address. 
</P>
<P>
This time he modified his plea: "Just do me one favor, just send me pictures of 
Natalie and let me know how she's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Again, no response. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that they wanted to start a new life," Miller said. "We all 
go through that. But you don't take a child away from someone like that. It's 
the worst sin in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said before he went to bed at night, he would stop to gaze at the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was comfort to know that within a few hours she would be looking at the 
same moon," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he made a vow to never stop searching for his daughter, but he knew 
that he had to proceed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"If I made contact, the mother would up and move again," Miller said. "I didn't 
want that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hobbelen said for years she never knew about Miller. "I was told my stepfather 
was my real father," she said. But she said she suspected something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Her stepfather, whom she said she never felt close to, was missing from the 
early pictures of her life. Also, Hobbelen did not resemble anyone in the 
family. She had blond hair and blue eyes, whereas her mother had dark hair and 
her stepfather had red hair. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone at school was teasing me," Hobbelen recalled. "They asked me if I was 
adopted." 
</P>
<P>
When she was 11, she asked her mother why she did not fit in. Initially, her 
mother brushed her questions aside. Then she told Hobbelen about Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"All she said was he lived in America," Hobbelen said. "I was never really 
encouraged to find him." 
</P>
<P>
She said she decided to drop the subject out of respect for her mother and 
stepfather. But Miller was always in her thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like part of me was missing," Hobbelen said. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, a private detective discovered that Natalie had married and 
was living in Caboolture, Australia, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
But doctors warned him not to contact her unexpectedly because if she were 
pregnant, the shock could cause a miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologists said the contact had to be made in person, not over the phone," 
he said. "We didn't know if she knew I was alive." 
</P>
<P>
He planned a trip to Australia. But shortly before he was scheduled to leave, 
he had a seizure, apparently caused by scar tissue on the right side of his 
brain. He was placed on medication and ordered by doctors not to travel. 
</P>
<P>
So Miller, who owns an Oxnard marketing firm, decided to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hobbelen's mother died of cancer, and the daughter pledged to find 
her father. 
</P>
<P>
First, Hobbelen went to the library in Sydney and looked through the Los 
Angeles phone book. But there was no Arthur S. Miller listed. When she arrived 
in Redondo Beach to visit her mother's relatives last month she searched 
through the phone books again. No luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my great-aunt remembered that his father had been a firefighter," 
Hobbelen said. 
</P>
<P>
So she called the Los Angeles Fire Department. Department officials initially 
were reluctant, but then they agreed to help, Hobbelen said. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart sank, I was so excited," Hobbelen said. 
</P>
<P>
They were able to find an address of Hobbelen's grandfather, Arthur W. Miller, 
a retired Los Angeles battalion chief. They sent him a letter at his residence 
in Hawaii informing him of his granddaughter's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
The letter arrived on Sept. 17, one day before the elder Miller was scheduled 
to leave for Florida. He called his son immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Son, you better be sitting down,' " Miller said. " 'I have a letter 
here from the Fire Department. . . . It says Natalie would like you to get hold 
of her.' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he was speechless. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't imagine that she would try to find me," he said. "I was trembling, 
I couldn't think straight." 
</P>
<P>
After several unsuccessful attempts to dial the phone, Miller reached Hobbelen. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember he was crying on the phone," Hobbelen said. "He said, 'Natalie, 
this is your father.' Then I asked a dumb question: 'Really?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to say. I was so happy. At last, at last I found my 
father." 
</P>
<P>
They met in Redondo Beach. Miller arrived at Hobbelen's grandparents' residence 
with 24 red roses for the time they were apart, and two white roses for the 
time they were together. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, they have stayed up until 2 a.m. every night at Miller's Malibu 
condominium getting caught up on the years they missed. 
</P>
<P>
Miller gave his daughter all the presents and birthday cards he had bought for 
her but was never able to give her. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a heaven, I'm in it," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbelen said she will return to Australia in two weeks, but she and her 
husband might move to California. Meanwhile, Miller said he is now well enough 
to travel and is planning a trip to see his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited 22 years for this, and I'm not going to let her go," Miller said. 
"God has welded us together."

SOME SAY OJAI SHOULD MERGE INTO NEW CITY; 
</P>
<P>
ANNEXATION: OFFICIALS FIND SUPPORT FROM RESIDENTS OF NEARBY COMMUNITIES FOR A 
PLAN TO ABSORB NEIGHBORING AREAS. THEY ALSO HEAR COUNTERPROPOSALS.

<P>
A proposal by an Ojai city councilman that the city look into annexation of 
surrounding county areas has touched off a chorus of counterproposals that Ojai 
should instead disincorporate and become part of a new and larger Ojai Valley 
city. 
</P>
<P>
As a controversy grew this week over how Ojai Valley communities might best 
protect their interests in the face of increasing growth, Ojai officials moved 
cautiously toward a decision on whether to actually conduct a formal annexation 
study. 
</P>
<P>
A report on how much Ojai will have to pay to proceed with an annexation study 
will be submitted to the City Council by early November, City Manager Andrew 
Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
The report will include cost estimates of hiring consultants to conduct a 
public opinion survey aimed at determining whether Ojai Valley residents would 
support annexation by the city, Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to do enough research on this to give them an idea of what would be 
involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to consider possible annexation was made last week by City 
Councilman James Loebl. Belknap said the Ojai City Council will not take a 
position until his report has been submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Loebl said this week that he hopes an annexation study can be done as soon as 
possible, perhaps within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should move reasonably quickly," he said. "You've got to move at a 
speed that on one hand does not appear threatening and on the other is not so 
glacial it does not appear to be moving at all." 
</P>
<P>
In making the annexation proposal, Loebl said the idea was partly in response 
to a new county policy charging cities for the booking of prisoners in Ventura 
County Jail. He estimated that the new policy would cost Ojai up to $50,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said another factor in considering an annexation study is Ojai's 
view that it can control growth in the surrounding Ojai Valley better than the 
county, which now permits more growth in such areas as Meiners Oaks and Oak 
View than Ojai allows inside its city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Loebl, who once opposed expansion of Ojai boundaries, said he views county 
growth in the Ojai Valley as "the biggest land boom in the history of the 
valley." 
</P>
<P>
A larger city would have more bargaining power with the county on such issues 
as booking fees, he said. He added that he believes more people live outside 
the city of Ojai than outside any other city in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, before Proposition 13, it was difficult to sell annexation because 
of the difference in tax rates," he said. "I believe the areas outside the city 
in the valley are approaching problems in a more unified manner than they used 
to. Does this mean they are identical? No, not at all. But they are getting 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
Loebl stressed that he is only proposing that those areas that are interested 
in joining the city should be considered for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that it doesn't make any difference if it is called the city of 
Ojai or the city of Ojai Valley," he said. Unless the residents called for 
incorporation of an entirely new city, Loebl said he didn't see any need to 
form a new one. 
</P>
<P>
Loebl first unveiled his annexation proposal in a local newspaper column last 
month in which he berated the county for allowing three times the amount of 
growth in the Ojai Valley during the past 10 years as the city of Ojai would 
have allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated population of the entire Ojai Valley, according to county 
figures, is 27,529. Ojai's post-census population count this year was 7,501. 
</P>
<P>
While Loebl's annexation talk has brought expressions of concern from some 
community leaders in the nearby towns of Oak View and Meiners Oaks that Ojai 
may be out to gobble up surrounding communities, there has also been 
considerable support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the proposal, some Ojai Valley residents said they approve of the 
concept of politically unifying the entire area, but think it might be better 
for Ojai to disincorporate and become part of a new and larger city. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard (Gary) W. Orthuber of Meiners Oaks, an attorney who serves on the 
Ventura River Valley Municipal Advisory Council that reviews planning issues in 
the Ojai Valley, said a unification process for the valley could cause less 
resentment from non-city residents than annexation. "A request to annex Meiners 
Oaks would have serious problems," Orthuber said. "Some people have felt a good 
lynching was appropriate for those who suggested that in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the unincorporated areas are getting closer to realizing they 
have to do something, they can't depend on County Hall," he said. "They are 
urban areas now. All the problems of cities exist out here." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, when county supervisors, at the request of then-Supervisor Ken 
MacDonald, who represented Ojai Valley, released a valley unification study in 
1980, the city objected. Ojai leaders did not want to see Ojai absorbed by a 
larger city. 
</P>
<P>
"They were afraid they'd be gobbled up," Orthuber said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald, who represented Ojai on the Board of Supervisors in the early 1960s 
and again in the late 1970s after a stint in the state Legislature, worked hard 
at advocating a valleywide city before he retired from office. He said his main 
opposition came from the city of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think it's the logical way to go," MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocate David Hirschberg, an Ojai resident since 1939 and a 
longtime city planning commissioner, said he thinks that a strong argument can 
be made for either annexation or a valleywide city. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps for just plain survival's sake, we might have to go that route," 
Hirschberg said. "We are all breathing the same air. The other side of the coin 
is . . . Ojai and the other communities might lose their small-town feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the unincorporated area of the county east of Ojai usually 
consider themselves Ojai residents although some live several miles outside the 
city limits. Lerie Bjornstedt, owner-broker of Ojai Realty in downtown Ojai, 
lives on McNell Road near the Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have no problem with it," Bjornstedt said of a valleywide city. "What 
affects the city affects the valley, and what the county does affects the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Daffern of Mira Monte, former director of the Ventura County Taxpayers 
Assn., said he asked city officials several years ago to look at unification or 
annexation of Mira Monte and Meiners Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"The unincorporated area doesn't have enough votes to put a supervisor in 
office nor can we put anyone in Ojai City Hall, yet we are both under their 
jurisdiction in one form or another," Daffern said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the entire community would be better served if it were incorporated 
to receive services such as street sweeping we haven't enjoyed since Prop. 13," 
Daffern said. "I think the benefits would offset any increased costs." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rival proposals that Ojai either annex the surrounding areas 
or dissolve itself to become part of a new city called Ojai Valley, some area 
residents also expressed support for the idea of creating two cities in the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real interesting turn of events," said Mary Ann Krause, who just moved 
out of Oak View after more than a decade of serving on citizen advisory 
committees dealing with valley planning issues and incorporation. She 
co-chaired a committee that released a report last week that concludes that a 
separate city in addition to Ojai might be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
If Oak View, Meiners Oaks, Mira Monte and Casitas Springs incorporated on their 
own to form a separate city, the study found that it might squeak by 
financially despite a $275,000 deficit in revenues. The estimated population of 
such a second city would be 15,000. Its annual revenue was projected at $2.77 
million with annual expenses at $3 million. "Although we didn't evaluate it in 
this study, it would probably be more cost-effective to annex to the city of 
Ojai," Krause said. "It might mean some leveling of service areas in the city."

FORUM PLANNED ON ORGANIC CROPS

<P>
A Ventura-based nonprofit organization called Mothers &amp; Others for Safe 
Foods, which opposes the use of pesticides on food crops, will sponsor a 
community forum in Ventura Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, which will include representatives from two consumers groups, a 
produce buyer, a large-scale organic grower, a pediatrician and a farm adviser 
for the University of California, will cover topics ranging from the health 
effects of pesticides to organic farming techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Pavich, who has a 2,000-acre table-grape farm in Delano, Calif., is 
scheduled to speak at the forum. He said Monday that Ventura County citrus and 
row-crop growers could reduce or eliminate pesticides with techniques similar 
to those he has used for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Pavich uses 50 or 60 techniques, including beneficial insects that prey on 
pests and mixing crops. 
</P>
<P>
"The proof is in the pudding, and I can tell them it works," Pavich said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Reeder, a Fillmore citrus grower who is president of the Ventura County 
Farm Bureau, said the weather, soil and crops vary drastically between the San 
Joaquin Valley, where Delano is located, and the south coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The beneficial bugs that work in Delano might not work in Ventura," Reeder 
said. Nevertheless, he said, Ventura County growers are working to reduce 
pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just as conscious about pesticides as the organic grower or the 
environmentalists," he said. "And dollars are a factor too. It costs us $150 
every time we run a spray rig through the orchard." 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said he and several other farmers plan to attend the forum Wednesday to 
learn more about organic farming and about consumer concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers &amp; Others for Safe Foods was founded by Ventura resident Frances 
Scharli in 1989. Scharli formed the group in reaction to the Environmental 
Protection Agency announcement declaring Alar a suspected carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 p.m. forum at the Poinsettia Pavilion, 3451 Foothill Road in Ventura, is 
the second annual session for the Mothers &amp; Others group. JOANNA M. MILLER

POLICE PLAN TO CUT JAIL BOOKING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department will try to cut down on bookings into Ventura 
County Jail to reduce its payments to the jail, which recently started charging 
fees, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors decided last month to offset state funding cuts 
by charging cities about $120 each time their police officers book someone into 
Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will go into effect Jan. 1 but will be retroactive to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The new fees would cost the Ventura Police Department $400,000 to $500,000 
annually, Lt. Pat Rooney said. But with cost-cutting measures, the department 
believes that it can reduce the number of billable bookings into the jail by 
two-thirds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy set forth by Police Chief Richard F. Thomas, the 
department itself will handle felony offenders who are to be released on their 
own recognizance or released after posting bail. Offenders thought to be 
dangerous or likely to commit another crime will still be taken to County Jail, 
Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the subject is dangerous, of course they're going to be booked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In misdemeanor cases, the department routinely cites and releases some 
offenders rather than taking them to jail. Misdemeanor offenders are put into 
the jail only under certain conditions, such as having an outstanding arrest 
warrant or failing to provide satisfactory proof of identification, Rooney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The department will now have sergeants monitor misdemeanor arrests more 
carefully to make sure that no one is placed in the jail who does not fit those 
conditions, Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy is temporary. Police will be evaluating its effectiveness in 
meeting safety needs and reducing booking costs, according to a statement 
issued by Thomas. CAROL WATSON

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN STABBED TO DEATH IN APPARENT LOVE 
TRIANGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 52-year-old man was stabbed to death this week following a dispute with his 
girlfriend's former boyfriend in the unincorporated Florence district, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was identified as Glen Youngblood of Los Angeles, was visiting 
his girlfriend at her home in the 1200 block of Nadeau Street when the woman's 
former boyfriend arrived shortly after 7 p.m. and the three began to argue, 
sheriff's Sgt. George Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect then produced a knife and attacked the victim, chasing him from 
room to room, slashing and stabbing him," Deputy Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker chased the victim into a vacant field, then fled after the victim 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors saw the attack and called the Fire Department. The victim was taken 
to Martin Luther King, Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was unharmed. Authorities declined to name the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive appears to be jealousy," Erickson said.

LANDFILL ASKED TO BAR L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
CALABASAS: MIKE ANTONOVICH WANTS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO THE COUNTY'S DUMP 
BECAUSE THE CITY DENIED EXPANSION AT SUNSHINE CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Tuesday proposed closing Los Angeles County's 
landfill in Calabasas to all trash generated in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor's aides said the proposal was prompted in part by the city's 
recent decision to kill a proposal by Browning-Ferris Industries to expand the 
Sunshine Canyon Landfill above Granada Hills. Browning-Ferris officials said 
they were forced to cut back the daily dumping from 3,000 tons to 700 tons this 
week because of the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich was concerned that more trash trucks would be diverted to the 
Calabasas landfill because of Sunshine Canyon's reduced capacity, said Rosa 
Kortizija, an Antonovich deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"The trash that used to go to BFI will now go elsewhere. The life of our 
landfill could be shortened," Kortizija said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to make sure the county residents have a place to put their 
trash," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich proposed his plan at a closed-door executive session with 
supervisors Tuesday. He hopes to introduce the ordinance authorizing a ban at 
next Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
City trash trucks dump 700 to 1,000 tons a day at the Calabasas landfill, said 
Del Biagi, the city's Bureau of Sanitation director. He said 70 to 100 city 
trucks would have to go elsewhere if the ban takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be going around to all the existing landfills to see who has existing 
capacity. There aren't many of those around," Biagi said. 
</P>
<P>
Biagi expressed surprise that the county would try to stop city access to the 
Calabasas dump. 
</P>
<P>
"The Calabasas landfill is located at such a place that it is obviously 
intended to serve the West Valley. There would be a real question of why the 
city would be foreclosed from using the site." 
</P>
<P>
The city picks up 6,000 tons of trash a day -- most of it from single-family 
homes and small apartment buildings, said Anna Sklar, a spokeswoman for the 
city's sanitation bureau. The majority -- 4,000 tons -- is dumped at Lopez 
Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
But Antonovich's proposal would also deny access to private haulers who pick up 
refuse from businesses, condominiums and large apartment buildings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to county statistics, 50% of the trash dumped at the Calabasas 
landfill comes from private haulers who collect it in the city. Another 12% of 
the waste comes from Ventura County and 13% comes from smaller cities such as 
Hidden Hills, Westlake Village and Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's motion would ensure that those small cities would continue to have 
dumping privileges at the Calabasas landfill, which accepts 3,000 tons a day. 
The landfill is expected to continue operating until about the year 2007. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the supervisors, Antonovich's motion would still need approval 
of the county's sanitation districts.

RAIL PLAN MAY GET 2ND CHANCE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: COUNTY OFFICIALS ASK CALTRANS TO RECONSIDER A PROPOSED 
LAX-TO-PALMDALE LINE THAT HAS BEEN PASSED OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors and other elected officials on Tuesday called 
for revival of a proposed magnetic levitation rail line from Los Angeles 
International Airport to Palmdale that was spurned by Caltrans last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a motion urging the state 
transportation agency to continue studying the 125-m.p.h. line, which would be 
built by a private partnership on freeway shoulders or medians. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who chairs the Assembly 
Transportation Committee, told a Lancaster civic gathering that the proposed 
elevated "maglev" line is "one of the most innovative projects I've seen in a 
long time." He also vowed to "make this project work one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans two weeks ago passed over the rail line in favor of four proposed toll 
highways -- two in Orange County, one in San Diego County and one in Alameda 
County east of Oakland. The four winners were among eight projects competing in 
a new state program that allows privately owned transportation projects on 
public land. 
</P>
<P>
The LAX-to-Palmdale line, on which trains would be propelled by electromagnetic 
force on a cushion of air, was designated as an alternate, to be selected only 
if one of the highway projects falters. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Supervisor Mike Antonovich and Nikolas Patsaouras, a member of the 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, have suggested that the 
commission might sponsor the futuristic line. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras acknowledged Tuesday that the state controls the needed right of 
way, but said, "We think the proposal should be out there to see if they can be 
persuaded to give up the right of way." 
</P>
<P>
He called it "too good a project just to let die" and said he has asked the 
commission staff to suggest ways for commissioners to sponsor the project. 
</P>
<P>
A report is expected later this month, said Patsaouras, who also heads the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The commission in 1980 designated the San Diego Freeway corridor from Sylmar to 
LAX as a part of the 150-mile rail system it is building with the proceeds of 
the extra half-cent sales tax approved by county voters. 
</P>
<P>
Although the corridor is expected to yield a high ridership, all rail 
construction funds have been committed until at least 2002, planners say, 
adding that it would be at least 15 years before the commission could build a 
rail line along that route. 
</P>
<P>
Katz has said that if the maglev line does not win inclusion into the Caltrans 
privatization program by the end of the year, he will introduce legislation to 
permit the medians and shoulders of the San Diego, Golden State and Antelope 
Valley freeways to be used for the line. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged Tuesday that such special legislation might be difficult to 
get passed and that the easiest route to success is to pressure Caltrans to 
belatedly designate the line as part of its privatization program. 
</P>
<P>
He again attacked Caltrans for passing over the project, which he called "a 
little too creative and a little too innovative for people who are used to 
pouring concrete all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
In urging supervisors to approve his motion Tuesday, Antonovich called the rail 
line a "vital link providing transportation from the Antelope Valley to Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The maglev line was proposed by a consortium formed by Massachusetts-based 
Perini Corp., the Los Angeles engineering firm of Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; 
Mendenhall and the HSST Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
After construction, the partnership would deed the project to the state, then 
lease it back for 35 years. Profits would be generated by fares. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at LAX, the line would travel the median of the San Diego Freeway, 
stopping at the Marina Freeway, Wilshire and Victory boulevards and the Simi 
Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The line's 31-mile-long first phase would end in Santa Clarita and would cost 
$1.3 billion. Rail planners say it would carry about 55,000 passengers daily, 
most of them commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that after being extended 38 more miles to Palmdale Airport, the 
line would attract airport-bound passengers as well as those bound for Las 
Vegas, who could connect at Palmdale to a proposed high-speed maglev line 
connecting the gambling mecca to Southern California.

2 BUILDINGS ON ARCADE TO GET 2ND STORIES 
</P>

<P>
The Ojai Historical Preservation Commission, after approving a proposed second 
story for two Arcade buildings, said it wants future building applicants to 
consult with architects who specialize in historic structures. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members voted 2 to 1 Monday to back the proposed additions at 250 
and 254 E. Ojai Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The project, proposed by Larry Wilde, Dennis Guernsey and Andrew Pollet, all of 
Ojai, will be reviewed Monday by the Ojai Redevelopment Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Marc Whitman of Ojai said he had consulted with a historic 
preservation architect and had designed the retail-office complex in a Spanish 
Mission style to complement the Arcade. 
</P>
<P>
The arched walkway was built in 1917 and is on the commission's list to be 
considered for landmark designation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bold, beautiful and big like the Ojai Valley Inn, but it's not charming 
and it's not Ojai," Commissioner Rose Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
She was the lone vote against the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against all two-story buildings. I see no reason why we need them." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Zelma Wilson voted for it although she said it is unfortunate to 
have two-story buildings among the Arcade's dozen one-story shops. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to loom very large. It will hit you hard. But a lot of things loom 
large until they begin to meld into their environment," Wilson said. THIA BELL

COUNCIL BALKS AT PARKLAND PRICE TAG; 
</P>
<P>
FRYMAN CANYON: COUNCILMAN YAROSLAVSKY SAYS A $1.96-MILLION CITY CONTRIBUTION 
FOR THE PROPERTY COULD JEOPARDIZE OTHER SITE ACQUISITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council delayed a vote Tuesday on a proposal to spend 
$1.96 million to help buy Fryman Canyon for parkland after Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky expressed concern that the high price might jeopardize other park 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said there were two possible park sites in his Westside district -- 
one near Fossil Ridge and the other in Benedict Canyon -- that might be aborted 
by the Fryman Canyon purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to delay a vote until Nov. 7 came on the recommendation of 
Councilman Michael Woo, whose district includes the steep and heavily wooded 
canyon where property owner Fred Sahadi has proposed building 26 luxury houses. 
</P>
<P>
Woo told colleagues there was no need to allocate the money as long as the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state park agency, is still studying 
whether to participate in a plan, devised by Woo and Mayor Tom Bradley, to buy 
the 63-acre canyon for $10.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley-Woo plan called for the conservancy to put up $8.7 million, the 
city to contribute $1.96 million and private parties to provide $250,000 in 
charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy board of directors on Monday reaffirmed its "historic interest" 
in buying Fryman Canyon but refused to approve the Bradley-Woo plan until it 
checked with the state attorney general's office and the state Department of 
General Services about the terms. The conservancy board gave itself a Nov. 5 
deadline to reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has been reluctant to participate in a deal to buy the canyon 
if the total price is more than $8.7 million -- a valuation once agreed upon as 
fair by state officials. Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston has 
expressed concerns about paying $10.9 million when his agency does not have a 
state-approved appraisal justifying the price. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the deal also began to surface on the council floor Tuesday. 
Yaroslavsky warned his colleagues that if too much is paid for Fryman Canyon, 
other worthwhile Santa Monica Mountains parkland purchases "would be blown out 
the window." The per-acre price would be among the highest in the history of 
the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now you haven't heard from other quarters," Yaroslavsky said. "But 
this decision may have an impact on other projects and we need to minimize 
that. There are major acquisitions that are much cheaper than this one. I don't 
think the people want to pay a developer more for his property than it's 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
Woo, in a testy reply, said: "I am not proposing to pay the developer more than 
it's worth." The councilman also pledged to work with other council members to 
be "sensitive to parks projects in your districts." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's concerns echoed those of Joyce Coleman, a top Sierra Club 
official, who objected to any conservancy attempt "to raid funds set aside to 
protect and expand Solstice Canyon Park" in Malibu. For it to pay $8.7 million 
for Fryman Canyon would require the conservancy to drop other acquisition 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to set Nov. 7 as the next date for taking up the question of 
spending the $1.96 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the council voted 6 to 5 to reject a plan to make half of Fryman 
Canyon a cultural-historic landmark. Opponents of the housing development 
originally sought landmark status as a means to preserve the land. But in 
recent months, that proposal had taken a back seat to a plan to acquire the 
Studio City site as a park.

DEVELOPER CUTS WARNER RIDGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Jack Spound said Tuesday that he has a new plan to build a 
690,000-square-foot, mixed-use project on Warner Ridge that would be 15% 
smaller than his original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which Spound characterized as a compromise, calls for a project with 
100 residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those units would be designated as "affordable," which means they would 
be within reach of lower-income tenants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spound's offer is the latest development in his lengthy battle with 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the Warner Ridge area in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Picus opposes any commercial development at the site. Last January, the council 
-- at Picus' insistence -- imposed residential zoning on the property that 
would permit construction of several dozen luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
Spound originally sought a 810,000-square-foot commercial project. He later 
proposed a 540,000-square-foot office and retail complex that also included 350 
residential units. Spound explained his latest plan to reporters Tuesday. He 
has not yet taken it to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Picus was on vacation Tuesday and Michele Gagan, her chief deputy, refused to 
comment on Spound's proposal, saying it would be inappropriate while the Spound 
Co. and its partner, Johnson Wax Development Co., were suing the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski ruled that Woodland Hills must 
zone the property to conform to the city's general plan for the area, 
permitting Spound and his partners to build some type of commercial project. 
The general plan for Warner Ridge calls for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski gave the city 30 days to complete the rezoning. To meet the deadline, 
the council was supposed to approve the ordinance this week. But the need for 
quick action was lifted last week when a state Court of Appeal granted a 
temporary stay pending a decision on the city's appeal of Zebrowski's ruling.

LEGAL LIMBO THAWING FOR THOSE WHO BACK CRYONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has given renewed life to a group that 
freezes the dead in hopes they may be revived someday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Aurelio Munoz ruled Tuesday that it is illegal for the state Department 
of Health Services to refuse to provide death certificates and body disposition 
permits for those who want their bodies frozen after death. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, those who had chosen to have their bodies frozen after death have 
been left in legal limbo. The state had refused to issue death certificates or 
other permits, which relatives often needed to settle estates and obtain 
insurance payments. 
</P>
<P>
In a written opinion, Munoz said people have the right to dispose of their 
bodies as they wish. However, he noted that if the state wants to regulate the 
cryonics industry, it first must set up licensing and regulatory procedures. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials have not decided whether to appeal the decision or to 
set up such regulations, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Tammy Chung, who argued 
the case for the state. "We obviously did not agree with the decision," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was hailed as a "total victory" by David Epstein, attorney for 
Riverside-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation, the nonprofit business that 
took the state to court. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor President Carlos Mondragon said the ruling will give increased 
credibility to cryonics and predicted his business will "skyrocket" as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor filed the suit in 1988 on behalf of television producer Richard C. Jones, 
who went under the name Dick Clair. An Emmy-award winning writer for the Carol 
Burnett Show, Clair was hospitalized with AIDS. The hospital refused to allow 
Clair to give his body to Alcor, saying state officials told them it was 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor went to court and obtained a temporary restraining order from Munoz that 
directed the hospital to release Clair's body upon his death. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor subsequently obtained and froze Clair's body, one of 16 in cryonic 
suspension at the facility. Another 280 people are in the process of signing up 
for the program. Among those waiting are a Xerox scientist from Palo Alto and a 
computer engineer from San Jose, who were also plaintiffs in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor charges $100,000 to freeze an entire body and $30,000 for only the head. 
The fees are usually paid by life insurance policies, which clients sign over 
to Alcor. 
</P>
<P>
The cryonics movement was started in 1962 by a retired Michigan college physics 
instructor and has been most popular in California. Alcor conducted its first 
freezing of a body in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
In the cryonics process, entire bodies or sometimes just the heads are placed 
in receptacles that look like giant stainless steel Thermos bottles. These 
receptacles are filled with liquid nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
Cryonics proponents believe that by the time science advances to the point 
where the dead can be revived, it also will be able to make new bodies for the 
frozen heads. 
</P>
<P>
Critics concede the process may be hypothetically possible. But they also say 
that today's technology is too limited to prepare the bodies for future 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor President Mondragon said that after a Northern California cryonics 
company went out of business and allowed bodies to thaw out in the early 1980s, 
the health department decided not to issue any permits for cryonics. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor Attorney Epstein contended that the group was caught in a "Catch-22" 
situation. State law says firms dealing with bodies -- such as cryonics 
businesses -- must be licensed by the health department. However, Epstein said, 
the health agency does not provide such licenses for cryonics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature was mistaken in assuming that the health department had a 
mechanism in place to license such organizations," said Chung.

PRIME TIME CITED FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CAL/OSHA SAYS WORKERS HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO EXHAUST FUMES AT THE SHUTTLE 
COMPANY'S VAN NUYS HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Prime Time Airport Shuttle Inc. has been cited by Cal/OSHA for 14 violations of 
state worker safety laws, including exposing reservation and dispatch agents to 
engine exhaust fumes from shuttle vans at its Van Nuys warehouse-headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Time, which transports about 50,000 travelers per month, primarily 
between their homes and Los Angeles and Orange county airports, paid $1,190 in 
fines after being cited five weeks ago. Cal/OSHA released documents on its 
investigation of the firm this week. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA launched the three-day investigation in August after receiving a 
complaint that reservation and dispatch clerks were subjected to exhaust fumes 
while working in an office trailer in the Arminta Street warehouse where the 
firm's passenger vans are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA inspector Mark W. Pisani said in a report that when the vans were 
started in the warehouse, exhaust gases were drawn into the office trailer's 
air-conditioning system. Employees were worried about being exposed to carbon 
monoxide in the fumes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Time also was cited for not having an eyewash unit near a machine that 
uses corrosive chemicals, storing an oxygen cylinder near highly combustible 
waste oil and grease, and not properly ventilating its garage. 
</P>
<P>
Cal/OSHA said the firm failed to post a list for employees of hazardous 
materials used in the garage and did not have documents showing that it trained 
mechanics to properly handle hazardous substances. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Time, the second-largest shuttle service in the Los Angeles area, serves 
Los Angeles, Burbank and John Wayne airports with a fleet of crimson vans. It 
also takes passengers to and from the Amtrak train station in downtown Los 
Angeles and cruise-ship piers in Long Beach and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Kindt, president of Prime Time, said Tuesday that the company has 
corrected the exhaust problem by routing fumes out of the building through 
flexible hoses connected to van tailpipes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a very caring management here. In fact, we know that the most important 
employees are our reservation agents and drivers," Kindt said. 
</P>
<P>
Kindt said the exhaust problem was "never really bad." It began one night when 
a mechanic started a van with a rebuilt engine, spewing smoke through the 
warehouse and forcing its evacuation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fumes presented no ongoing health threat to employees, about 30 of 
whom work in the Van Nuys building. The firm employs about 400 people overall. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Time acted "a little bit slower . . . than I would have liked" in 
installing the exhaust hoses because it is moving to a new headquarters near 
Burbank Airport, Kindt said. 
</P>
<P>
Pisani said two of the 14 citations the firm received were for repeat 
violations. Prime Time was cited last February for, among other things, not 
maintaining information sheets on dangerous chemicals used in its garage and 
not having documents showing that it trained mechanics to handle hazardous 
substances.

SLAYING SUSPECT GETS TERM IN UNRELATED CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who has been identified as a suspect in the 1985 killing of his aunt, 
prominent Agoura businesswoman Judy Kanan, was found in violation of probation 
on an unrelated burglary conviction Tuesday and sentenced to two years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kanan, 34, was sentenced by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann 
Stoltz for violating his probation for a 1986 burglary of a car parked at the 
Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Kanan was arrested after patrol officers watched him break into the car Feb. 2, 
1986, while its owner was jogging in the park. He later pleaded guilty to 
burglary from a car and was placed on probation. He stopped reporting to his 
probation officer, and a warrant was issued for his arrest in 1988. He was not 
arrested until Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents and police revealed last week that Michael Kanan has become a 
suspect in the highly publicized slaying of his aunt in Woodland Hills on Jan. 
29, 1985. Judy Kanan, 68, a well-known businesswoman and descendant of the 
pioneer family that settled Agoura, was shot four times as she stepped out of 
her car to feed her horses at a nearby stable. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying has remained unsolved for more than five years, but an informant 
came forward this year and told police that Michael Kanan killed his aunt in a 
family dispute over property. Michael Kanan, through his attorney, denied 
having any part in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said they are seeking additional evidence that corroborates the 
informant's story before seeking murder charges against the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Kanan, Stoltz gave him credit for 430 days already served in 
custody, court officials said.

RED SOX PARTY IS ON HOLD;

VICTORY OVER THE ORIOLES.

<P>
On the 12th anniversary of one of their darkest moments, the lights were 
flickering again for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
They lost to the Chicago White Sox, 3-2, in 11 innings Tuesday night, blowing a 
chance to wrap up the American League's Eastern Division title 12 years after 
Bucky Dent hit that improbable home run into the net above the left-field wall 
at Fenway Park to snatch the 1978 division title for the New York Yankees in a 
one-game playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Now the star-crossed Red Sox, who have lost the only two playoffs in American 
League history, face the possibility of another. They lead the Toronto Blue 
Jays, who defeated the Baltimore Orioles, 2-1, by one game on the final day of 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
If Boston fails to hold that lead, they face the Blue Jays in the SkyDome at 1 
p.m. PDT Thursday. Roger Clemens will fly to Toronto today to be rested for 
that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I said it would go down to the bitter end, but I hope I'm wrong," Red Sox 
Manager Joe Morgan said. "The bitter end would be a playoff." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dwight Evans: "We're a little down right now but not out. We know we have 
a job to do and still feel we're in the driver's seat. We'll battle 'em 
tomorrow, and if we have to, we'll come back Thursday and battle 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, when Ozzie Guillen drove in the winning run against Dennis Lamp, 
who later questioned Morgan's bullpen deployment, Boston wasted solid pitching, 
an eighth-inning comeback against Bobby Thigpen, the majors' save leader, and a 
chance to save Mike Boddicker (16-8) for Sunday's second game of the playoff 
against the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Red Sox must use Boddicker tonight against Alex Fernandez (5-4), the 
21-year-old right-hander who was Chicago's No. 1 June selection out of Miami 
Dade South Community College. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it tells you what we think of him to start him on the last day of the 
season with a pennant on the line," White Sox Manager Jeff Torborg said. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 33,917 at Fenway Park was up and on its feet for most of the final 
innings Tuesday. Guillen pulled a two-out slider from Lamp, the fourth Boston 
pitcher, into right field to score Ron Karkovice, who had singled with one out 
and taken second on a single by Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit a hell of a slider -- low and away," Morgan said of the pitch to 
Guillen. "I don't know how he hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Guillen didn't say, but he did say the White Sox, with their 94-67 record, the 
second best in the American League and third best in baseball, have "too much 
pride to lay down and die for anyone. I think we've proven we're a better team 
than they (the Red Sox) are all season." 
</P>
<P>
Several Red Sox relievers, including Jeff Reardon and Larry Andersen, have 
expressed confusion about their roles and the way Morgan has used them. Lamp 
joined that unhappy delegation Tuesday night.

"I feel like I let everybody down," he said. "I shouldn't feel that way, but I 
do. I was mentally ready to go in, but physically I only have so much to give. 
I warmed up in the first, second and fifth innings before I warmed up again in 
the 10th tonight, and I don't know if they are even aware that I warmed up 
several times, too. When the weather is as cold as it was tonight, you have to 
start over every time you warm up. I mean, it was warm up, cool off, warm up, 
game over." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox put their leadoff batter on in each of the first four innings, but 
this is a team with virtually no speed, with no hitter adept at batting second 
and with a manager who seldom bunts or uses the hit-and-run. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Red Sox grounded into three double plays, increasing their 
major league-leading total to 173 in 161 games. 
</P>
<P>
A wild pitch by Melido Perez, who lasted only 1 1/3 innings in each of his last 
two starts, gave Boston a run in the first inning after a two-out single by 
Wade Boggs and double by Ellis Burks. He then permitted only one more hit until 
the eighth, when Tom Brunansky led off with a double. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the White Sox led, 2-1, and the call went to Thigpen, who had 
converted 57 of 64 save opportunities. This time, however, Tony Pena's 
sacrifice put pinch-runner Jeff Stone on third, and pinch-hitter Danny Heep's 
sacrifice fly tied the score. The Red Sox had two on and two out in the inning, 
but Boggs grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
Boston also had the bases loaded with two out in the 10th, but Donn Pall got 
Burks on a fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Edwards then pitched the 11th for Chicago, overcoming a two-out single by 
Kevin Romine when he got Pena to ground into a game-ending force play. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bolton allowed only one run in six innings as the Boston starter before 
leaving with the bases loaded and one out in the seventh when Andersen's wild 
pitch produced the second run and marred a performance in which he otherwise 
retired five in a row.

WELCH WAVERS, BUT A'S HELP HIM WIN 27TH

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Welch became the first major league pitcher to win 27 games since Steve 
Carlton in 1972, relying on Rickey Henderson's speed and Jose Canseco's power 
to spark a seventh-inning rally that gave the Oakland Athletics a 6-4 victory 
over the Angels Tuesday at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to win one or two of these games to keep us on the right track for 
what we want to do," said Rickey Henderson, who stole two bases to move within 
two of tying Lou Brock's record of 938. 
</P>
<P>
However, Henderson stole no closer to AL batting leader George Brett, who did 
not play Tuesday. Henderson is hitting .325, three points behind Brett, 
entering today's season finale. 
</P>
<P>
"Brett's never going to play," Henderson said after going one for four. "That's 
one thing I don't like about him." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson started the two-out uprising with a liner that Angel reliver Willie 
Fraser (5-4) knocked down but couldn't play. He stole second against catcher 
John Orton and went to third on Dave Henderson's infield hit. Both scored on 
Canseco's double off the wall in right center, which gave Canseco 101 runs 
batted in. He surpassed 100 for the fourth time, an Oakland record. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of those magic marks for hitters," Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa 
said. "He was on his way to a monster year before (he hurt his back). To end up 
with 100 has a lot of meaning." 
</P>
<P>
Orton, who lives about 100 miles from Oakland in Soquel, Calif., always admired 
Henderson. "I'd always pretend when I was practicing, 'OK, Rickey Henderson's 
on first. What should I do?' I always threw him out in practice." 
</P>
<P>
But not in Oakland. Henderson also stole second in the sixth, took third on Jim 
Abbott's balk and scored on a single by Dave Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"He had me on that first one, but he was a little uptight," Rickey Henderson 
said. "I didn't get a good jump." 
</P>
<P>
He needs three steals to jump past Brock. "The day he does it, whether it's 
(today) or next year will be a great day because he will have done it in the 
name of playing the game right," LaRussa said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch (27-6) became the first AL pitcher to win 27 games since Denny McLain won 
31 for the Detroit Tigers in 1968. After giving up four runs in the first, two 
on Lee Stevens' seventh home run of the season, Welch settled down and 
scattered four hits in the next six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't out there looking for a (playoff) tuneup," Welch said. "I was looking 
to win a baseball game. Everything we talked about all year come together 
today. As a pitcher, you appreciate a victory like this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel broadcaster Reggie Jackson, a member of the A's World Series champion 
teams, said the current A's might eclipse the feats of his era. "Their ballclub 
is very similar to ours," he said. "The biggest difference is they have Rickey 
Henderson. Nobody has ever had a Rickey Henderson. . . . The biggest thing they 
have to worry about is falling asleep. They have to guard against having 
somebody ambush them." 
</P>
<P>
As expected, relief pitcher Greg Minton of the Angels officially announced his 
retirement.

SAMUEL'S SINGLE IN 10TH GIVES DODGERS 2ND PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers clinched second place in the National League West in style Tuesday 
night before 22,883 at Dodger Stadium, defeating the San Diego Padres, 8-7, in 
10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had staged a wild comeback to take a 7-6 lead in the eighth, only 
to have the Padres tie the score in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers needed only four batters in the 10th inning against Craig Lefferts 
(7-5). Mike Sharperson led off with a single to right field, Eddie Murray 
singled to right and Hubie Brooks was intentionally walked to load the bases. 
Juan Samuel followed with a single to center, scoring Sharperson with the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Walsh pitched the 10th inning and got his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
It all looked so easy against a pitcher with whom the Dodgers have had loads of 
trouble. Lifetime against the Dodgers, Lefferts was 9-0 with five saves and a 
2.04 earned-run average. But on this night, the Dodgers weren't to be 
restrained by the usual. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 6-2, with two out and none on in the bottom of the eighth inning, the 
Dodgers suddenly came to life. They scored five runs on a walk, four singles 
and an error to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The rally started when Padre starter Dennis Rasmussen walked Jose Gonzalez and 
wild-pitched him to second. Sharperson followed with a single to center, 
scoring Gonzalez to bring the Dodgers to within 6-3. Murray lined a single to 
left, sending Sharperson to third and Padre Manager Greg Riddoch to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Exit Rasmussen; enter Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Brooks lined Lefferts' first pitch into right field, scoring 
Sharperson and sending Murray to third base. Samuel followed with a grounder to 
second, but Joey Cora bobbled it and then threw it away. Murray scored, Brooks 
went to third and Samuel made it to second. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Mickey Hatcher, pinch-hitting for relief pitcher Jim Gott. Hatcher 
hit a single into right, scoring Brooks and Samuel. Lefferts then struck out 
Jose Offerman, but it was too late. Dodgers, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Howell, who replaced Gott, got two quick outs before Jack Clark -- who was 
eligible because he decided to appeal a one-game suspension earlier in the day 
-- Joe Carter and Mike Pagliarulo singled consecutively to make it 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres took an early lead thanks to two home runs by Jerald Clark. The 
first traveled over the right-center field fence in the fourth inning, a 
two-run shot off Dodger starter Mike Morgan. That put the Padres ahead, 3-0. 
Clark's second homer came two innings later against relief pitcher Tim Crews, a 
two-run shot to left that increased the Padre lead to 6-1 and Clark's RBI total 
for the evening to four. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was removed after the fifth inning, having allowed eight hits and four 
runs.

<P>
Kansas City's George Brett, leading the American League with a .328 average, 
kept himself out of the lineup in Tuesday night's game against the Cleveland 
Indians, saying he wanted to force Oakland's Rickey Henderson to catch him. 
Henderson had a .326 average going into Tuesday night's game against the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see what he does tonight," Brett said. "From the people I talked to, 
the consensus was, make him come to you." 
</P>
<P>
With Brett on the bench, the Indians scored nine runs in the first inning and 
won, 13-3, at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson went one for four in Oakland's 6-4 win over the Angels and slipped to 
.325. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 9, New York 4 -- The Pirates spoiled Dwight Gooden's bid for his 
20th victory and ended his eight-game winning streak at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Bream hit a two-run homer as Gooden (19-7) lost for the first time since 
Aug. 4. Working on three days rest instead of four, Gooden allowed nine hits 
and eight runs, six earned, in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla drove in two runs to raise his RBI total to 120, two behind NL 
leader Matt Williams of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Dave Magadan was one for five and dropped to .329, six points behind 
NL batting leader Willie McGee, traded from St. Louis to Oakland last month. 
Magadan would have to go five for five today to pass McGee. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Philadelphia 1 -- Andre Dawson reached the 100-RBI mark for the 
third time in his career as the Cubs defeated the Phillies at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, who left the game after driving in a run in the top of the first, 
improved his batting average to .310, the highest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Braves 16, Giants 7 -- Tommy Gregg's three-run, pinch-hit homer keyed a 
seven-run sixth inning for Atlanta at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg's fourth pinch-hit homer of the year put the Braves ahead, 7-6. Atlanta 
finished with 18 hits, including nine for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 2, St. Louis 1 -- Kevin Gross earned his first victory in more than 
three months and Otis Nixon set a base-stealing record as the Expos won at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon set a record for most stolen bases in the fewest at-bats in one season 
when he stole second base in the first inning. The steal was Nixon's 50th in 
228 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 3, Houston 2 -- None of the Reds' pitchers threw more than two 
innings in the victory over the Astros at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Four Red pitchers, including starter Jack Armstrong, retired the first 16 
batters in order before Luis Gonzalez doubled off Rick Mahler with one out in 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, Minnesota 0 -- Erik Hanson pitched a seven-hitter for his first 
major league shutout and became the second pitcher in Seattle history to get 18 
victories in a season as the Mariners beat the Twins at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the seventh straight for Hanson (18-9), who ended up one win 
shy of Mark Langston's club record. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 1, Texas 0 -- The Brewers' Kevin Brown gave up one hit over seven 
innings for his first major league victory as the Rangers lost at Milwaukee.

The Toronto Blue Jays did what they had to do to keep their title hopes alive, 
then waited about 90 minutes to see if their 2-1 victory over the Baltimore 
Orioles meant anything. 
</P>
<P>
Did it ever. 
</P>
<P>
After Fred McGriff hit a tie-breaking home run with two out in the ninth inning 
to give Toronto a victory it had to have Tuesday night, the Blue Jays gathered 
in the clubhouse to watch Boston play Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
When the final out of Chicago's 3-2 victory was recorded, the dozen or so 
players remaining in the Blue Jays' clubhouse let out a collective cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The American League East race boils down to this: Boston needs a win or a 
Toronto loss. If Toronto beats Baltimore on Wednesday night and Chicago beats 
first-place Boston, the teams will meet for a one-game playoff in Toronto on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Were it not for the superb pitching of Bud Black and McGriff's 35th homer, the 
Boston-Chicago game wouldn't have meant a thing. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 1-1, McGriff hit a 2-and-2 pitch from Baltimore's Dave Johnson 
(13-9) over the right-field wall. Tom Henke pitched the ninth to earn his 32nd 
save and keep the Blue Jays alive. 
</P>
<P>
It was Black's second victory in three appearances since the Blue Jays acquired 
him from Cleveland on Sept. 17. He will not be eligible should Toronto qualify 
for the American League playoffs.

Terms of Extermination: The Orkin Exterminating Co. is bugged over the product 
placement deal it made with the nation's No. 1 box-office movie this week: 
"Pacific Heights." 
</P>
<P>
In a breach of contract suit filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, Orkin said 
that it had agreed to pay $20,000 in a deal to portray the company in a 
favorable light. But "Pacific Heights" represented Orkin as "unwilling or 
unable to perform competent extermination services," the suit said. The 
contract specified that the company would be shown in a "non-disparaging" 
manner. BETH KLEID

ARGENTINE ENSEMBLE OPENS MONDAY EVE CONCERTS

A deeply serious, ultimately stimulating encounter with new music from Latin 
America launched the 52nd season of Monday Evening Concerts. Alicia Terzian and 
her Grupo Encuentros de Musica Contemporanea de Buenos Aires offered six 
intense, complementary pieces for a large, often restive crowd at the County 
Museum of Art's Bing Theater. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the drama, nervous energy and darkling mysteries of the program, 
the performances remained surprisingly low in energy and self-effacing -- 
neatly done, to be sure, but almost demure in music that seemed to call for 
extrovert flair. 
</P>
<P>
What the group is capable of in the way of focused passion became fully 
apparent only in the second part of the generous agenda. There, two potent, 
evocative vocal works framed a devastating instrumental elegy, Luis Naon's 
"Tango del Desamparo." 
</P>
<P>
Snatches of taped bandoneon music suggesting Piazolla at his most mournful 
provided a sonic and emotional context for the rich cello of Jorge Bergero and 
pertinent, highly colored pianism of Claudio Espector. 
</P>
<P>
Naon begins the piece as almost ritual storytelling -- narrated by Bergero -- 
of the "disappearance" of his brother during the 1976-83 Argentine military 
dictatorship, but words soon fail to sustain the overwhelming despair, which 
finds expression in lyrically yearning, fragmented and tonally skewed music. 
</P>
<P>
The "Testimonial" of Aurelio de la Vega, a professor at Cal State Northridge, 
is a taut song cycle on poems written by Armando Valladares while imprisoned in 
Cuba. Three songs move from quiet doom to defiance, separated by two 
instrumental interludes, the first a fey scherzo in memory of Ginastera and the 
second a linearly dissected dirge given great poignancy by the quotation of a 
Cuban song. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Blanco made the vocal parts emerge naturally from the instrumental web, 
as though the music were finding its inevitable, explicit voice. Her 
soft-grained mezzo did not project quite as forcefully as might be desired, but 
it blossomed easily in the swiftly reached final climax. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian conducted the deft, well-balanced ensemble -- Espector, Bergero, 
flutist Gabriel Sorin, clarinetist Oscar Baquedano and violinist Sergio 
Polizzi. 
</P>
<P>
The same group, minus the flute, also gave her a rapt, fluent performance of 
her own "Voces," on fragmentary texts from poets ranging from Lorca through 
Whitman to Tumanian. 
</P>
<P>
The voices of the title appear on tape, questioned and extended by Blanco in 
styles ranging from folklike chants to poignant pop intimations, with 
distracting quasi-dramatic movement and mime. Again, she had trouble balancing 
the amplified instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Blanco's fearlessly dramatic abilities found more appropriate, though more 
self-indulgent, work in Edgar Alandia's solo "Grito," interpreting lines from 
Neruda in hoary agitprop style. Blanco rose from the floor, moaning in rags, 
and ended back on the ground, as an earth mother delivering the anguished cry 
of a repressed people. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Iglesias Rossi's "Canto Viejo" is a moody instrumental evocation of 
Quechuan ritual music, relying heavily on skillfully scored effects such as 
multiphonics and under-the-string ponticello bowing. Terzian and company set it 
out with poised deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
The opening "Vox Faucibus Haesit" by Jose Luis Campana proved a cliched 
exercise in amplified instrumental Angst, scratchy climaxes succeeding nebulous 
aleatoric patches with little impact.

At the Newport Theatre Arts Center, "A Little Night Music" has a pretty face: 
Gil Morales' sets are airy and romantic, and Dan McWest's costumes, fetching 
but not overly bright, complement the environment nicely. 
</P>
<P>
The acting too was colorful at Saturday night's performance. But the cast, 
directed by D. Jay Bradley, often struggled with Stephen Sondheim's score, a 
relatively challenging collection of songs in three-quarter time. 
</P>
<P>
"A Little Night Music," inspired by the Ingmar Bergman film "Smiles of a Summer 
Night," offers a humorous take on love and lust. 
</P>
<P>
Just about all its characters have to grapple with annoying libidos while 
attempting to nurture feelings of a more "pure" nature. 
</P>
<P>
Everything comes to a head during a weekend in the country. Middle-aged 
Fredrick (Jim Rule) is married to lovely, naive Anne (CeCe Moore) but longs for 
the experienced Desiree (Mary Tuck), an old flame. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken the vainglorious Count Malcolm (Jeff Paul) as a lover. He, in 
turn, has a witty, vindictive wife (scene-swiping Diane Botnick). 
</P>
<P>
As Fredrick, Rule may not look like much of a romantic figure, but he does lend 
the role a weary dignity that is close to heroic, and he brings a decent 
singing voice to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck's Desiree is appropriately vivacious and her handling of "Send in the 
Clowns," while not the showstopper it can be, is gently felt. 
</P>
<P>
Paul scores points with his pompous portrayal, while Botnick gives the show its 
giddiest moments. 
</P>
<P>

BRYANT, EICHER: EFFORTLESS SKILL

<P>
Hip, laid-back and gentle are words that came to mind while hearing Betty 
Bryant perform at the Westwood Marquis. The singer-pianist has been a local 
resident since the mid-'50s, but her visibility around town has been as 
understated and low-profiled as her music. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two or three years, Bryant has been working with bassist Greg 
Eicher, and the partnership has produced a musically stimulating, almost 
seamlessly creative interactivity between the two players. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's opening set, for example, included a far-ranging, stylistically 
eclectic program of tunes, ranging from the bossa nova of "Corcovado" to the 
be-bop of "Jordu." Regardless of style or substance, however, Bryant's piano 
and Eicher's bass came together with deceptively effortless ease. 
</P>
<P>
While she is neither a powerful improviser nor an aggressive rhythmic player, 
Bryant's Kansas City blues roots generated a brisk, floating swing that brought 
buoyancy and light-heartedness to virtually everything she played. Eicher was 
an ideal companion, responsive and supportive, occasionally taking off on 
spirited solos of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The high points came on those numbers in which Bryant added her attractive 
contralto to the mix. A better-than-average jazz singer, with strong traces of 
Sarah Vaugahn and Carmen McRae, she was particularly appealing on the 
Portuguese-language bossa nova pieces, as well as a darkly whimsical original, 
"Don't Fall in Love With Me." 
</P>
<P>
The Bryant-Eicher duo's music, with its softly lyrical insinuations and bright 
rhythmic energies, seems perfectly chosen for the warmly muted environs of the 
Westwood Marquis Bar. They continue at the location, Tuesdays through 
Saturdays, until Oct. 27. DON HECKMAN

JUDGE ORDERS SILBERMAN TO PAY $50,000; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE FINE IS IN ADDITION TO THE 46-MONTH PRISON SENTENCE THE FORMER 
FINANCIER WAS GIVEN FOR HIS PART IN A MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard T. Silberman, sentenced last week to 46 months in federal prison for 
his role in a money-laundering scheme, was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine 
Tuesday amid disclosure that the once-wealthy San Diego financier owes more 
than $1.5 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Silberman's whopping debts, which total at least $2.1 million, U.S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving imposed the fine because he was not convinced 
Silberman was unable to pay a fine required under rigid new federal sentencing 
guidelines, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
The fine should finally resolve the long-running prosecution against Silberman, 
a one-time governor's aide. 
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the judge's ruling and I think this closes the book on 
Richard Silberman," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder, the lead 
prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
It closed even further Tuesday as Darryl Nakatsuka, a West Los Angeles security 
guard charged with taking part in the laundering scheme with Silberman, reputed 
mobster Chris Petti and two other men, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a sole felony 
count. 
</P>
<P>
The two others -- Los Angeles-area investment brokers -- also have pleaded 
guilty to felony counts over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the complex case is far from over. Petti is due to go to trial 
beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, Petti, Nakatsuka and the two other men were indicted on charges of 
laundering $300,000 in cash that an undercover FBI agent portrayed as the 
proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who once had served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., was arrested April 7, 1989, at a Mission Bay hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
When he was arrested, prosecutors contended, he already had directed two 
laundering deals with undercover FBI agent Peter J. Ahearn -- who was posing as 
Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug lords -- and was negotiating to 
do a third. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the two deals was a November, 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock 
in a Silberman gold-mining subsidiary. The second was a February, 1989, swap of 
$200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-month trial, Silberman, 61, was convicted June 28 of the same 
technical currency violation that Nakatsuka admitted Tuesday he also had 
violated. A jury deadlocked heavily for conviction on several other charges. On 
Aug. 24, Silberman agreed to a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to a sole felony 
conspiracy count, avoiding a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Irving sentenced Silberman, 61, to the 46-month term in federal 
prison. Irving temporarily put off a decision on a fine, saying he needed 
Silberman's up-to-date financial data. 
</P>
<P>
In the order issued late Tuesday, Irving noted that Silberman had said he had 
considerable debt. But Irving also said that because the data he was given 
contained a number of estimates, not firm figures, he was unconvinced that 
Silberman was unable to pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers James J. Brosnahan and George C. Harris, who work with San 
Francisco-based firm Morrison &amp; Foerster, said last week that Silberman was 
financially ruined and could not afford to pay a fine. However, the federal 
sentencing guidelines required some sort of fine -- from $7,500 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Without explanation, Irving said $50,000 was appropriate. He said Silberman 
could pay the fine in installments after he leaves prison -- in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also said that most of Silberman's estimated assets were pledged as 
security for his legal fees -- and that the current balance due the Morrison 
&amp; Foerster firm was $1,529,642. No information was available on how much 
Silberman already has paid in attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
Harris declined to comment on the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also said that Silberman owes an "estimated" $400,000 to Werner Wenger, 
a Swiss attorney. Prosecutors contend Werner was instrumental in moving money 
for Silberman through Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also owes $200,000 to a "family member," Irving said. That loan is 
from the father of his wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Golding could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nakatsuka, 44, who was accused of being a courier in the scheme, 
pleaded guilty Tuesday to a single count of "structuring" -- orchestrating the 
transfer of funds to avoid the paperwork federal law demands for any 
transaction over $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka also agreed to forfeit the $3,000 that prosecutors believe were his 
profits in the scheme as well as his share of the cash, stocks and bonds that 
were central to the case. In exchange, prosecutors dropped five other counts 
against him and gained the advantage of trying Petti alone. 
</P>
<P>
According to a formal plea agreement filed Tuesday at the San Diego federal 
courthouse, Nakatsuka was the "least culpable participant" in the laundering 
scheme. His lawyer, Mario Conte, said Tuesday that the deal was "very 
satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka said after a brief hearing Tuesday before Irving that he was pleased 
he would not be standing trial with Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 63, who introduced Silberman to FBI agent Ahearn, has pleaded not guilty 
to all seven counts against him. He is free on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, Nakatsuka could have been sentenced to up to 75 
years in prison. The plea bargain cuts the maximum term he can draw to five 
years, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal guidelines, Nakatsuka probably will be eligible for a term of 
six to 12 months or eight to 14 months, Gorder said. Irving set sentencing for 
Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka remains free on $200,000 bail, court records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the legal papers, Nakatsuka admitted that he helped Jack Norman 
Myers, 44, a Malibu investment banker and longtime friend of Silberman's, pick 
up the $100,000 on Nov. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka said he gave Myers a $4,000 fee and delivered the rest to his boss, 
investment broker Terry Ziegler, 45, of Moorpark in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler then took $41,500, broke it into various sums under $10,000 for deposit 
to a San Fernando Valley thrift account and wired it to Hong Kong, to a bank 
account that prosecutors contend was controlled by Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatsuka said in the legal papers that he knew "what he was doing was illegal" 
because he knew Ziegler would arrange the deposits to avoid the forms federal 
law requires for sums over $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The $41,500 -- and most of the rest of the $100,000 -- eventually made its way 
to a Swiss bank account, prosecutors contend. In legal papers filed last week, 
prosecutors also charged that Silberman pocketed $77,500 of the $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Myers pleaded guilty May 14 to a single felony count of federal currency 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
He testified against Silberman and is due to be sentenced on Nov. 19 -- 
presumably after Petti's trial, during which he is due to testify again, 
federal prosecutors have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have agreed to recommend that Myers receive a maximum of six months 
at a minimum-security federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler pleaded guilty April 10, to a sole felony count of violating federal 
currency laws. Irving sentenced him June 18 to six months in federal custody.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SAN DIEGO STILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GHOST TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Be advised that San Diego County is amply represented in the new book "Haunted 
Houses of California: A Ghostly Guide." 
</P>
<P>
That's real haunted houses -- apparitions, ectoplasm, restless dead people, 
mysterious goings-on, etc. -- not the Halloween type. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is by author Antoinette May, who grew up in La Jolla and writes a 
horoscope column for the San Francisco Chronicle. She's best known for her 
biographies of novelist Helen Hunt Jackson and war correspondent Marguerite 
Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
May identifies as San Diego County's poltergeist centers: 
</P>
<P>
* Rancho Jamul, built in 1852. Strange lights, cold spots, crying Indians, 
screaming women. 
</P>
<P>
* The Thomas Whaley House, built in 1857, in Old Town, once a site for public 
executions. Ghostly men in frock coats, weird women in calico dresses. 
</P>
<P>
* Casa de Estudillo, built in 1829, in Old Town. Faces in mirrors, flashes of 
red light. 
</P>
<P>
* Hotel del Coronado, room 502, doors closing, noises, lights, strange 
occurences, maybe from a hushed-up society suicide in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
* The Fallbrook Enterprise office. A little girl in a red dress is seen 
occasionally and vanishes, maybe from a long-ago family. 
</P>
<P>
At five, San Diego has one more haunted house than all of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
May, 47, who lives in Palo Alto, explained in a telephone interview that the 
history of San Diego County has all the fixings for wandering spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was a frontier town, with lots of violence, confusion, political 
feuding and discord," she said. "That's what generates the energy necessary for 
an atmosphere where spirits thrive." 
</P>
<P>
Violence, confusion, political feuding and discord as the ingredients for 
spooky stuff? 
</P>
<P>
If so, San Diego these days must be cooking an entire subdivision of haunted 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why not," May said. She's already trying to track down a 
modern haunting in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Something a Little Different 
</P>
<P>
The best of everything. 
</P>
<P>
* No chicken and peas, please. 
</P>
<P>
Kara Kobey may not be elected to the governing board of San Diego Community 
College. But her fund-raiser next Sunday seems destined to be the season's best 
buffet: 
</P>
<P>
Ceasar salad; rigatoni with four cheeses; canelloni Avanti; tortellini with 
walnuts, mushroom, cream and Parmesan; eggplant parmigiana; penne (macaroni) 
and spicy tomato sauce, and focaccia bread with onion and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
* The Lakeside-based Animal Press is tilting toward Dianne Feinstein in the 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein opposes puppy mills and supports putting animal-rights advocates on 
the Fish and Game Commission. Pete Wilson is mum. 
</P>
<P>
An irate voter called Pete Wilson's San Diego office to check a rumor that if 
Wilson is elected governor he'll appoint Sunny Bonno to his Seante seat. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
* With a week to go before the deadline, the drive to recall San Deigo 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt has only two-thirds of the signatures needed to 
force an election. 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: "When in despair, hug your bear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Putting a Claw on Glasnost 
</P>
<P>
For seven years, Larry Lobster was a regular at the Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-inch plastic lobster made his debut in the feast scene of the 1982 
production of "The Tempest." Then he became a good-luck charm and was hidden on 
stage for each new play. 
</P>
<P>
But he vanished after "Brothers and Sisters," last year's offering from the 
Maly Drama Theatre of Leningrad. A search was futile. 
</P>
<P>
Globe technical director Loren Schreiber has now just returned from a trip to 
the Maly. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he spotted Larry on stage. He also decided Larry should remain in 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Reason: An ersatz crustacean is a small price to pay for glasnost, dramatically 
speaking.

FISHING: A WAY OF LIFE FOR FOUR GENERATIONS HAS COME TO AN END FOR THE ZOLEZZI 
FAMILY. THEY AND OTHER TUNA FISHERMEN HAVE RELUCTANTLY BOWED TO ENVIRONMENTAL 
AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old fisherman died in the spring and his son and grandson agree on one 
thing: 
</P>
<P>
It would have broken the old man's heart -- San Diego harbor without a Zolezzi 
family tuna fishing boat, a harbor with only a handful of tuna vessels 
remaining in what once was a thriving tuna fishing community. 
</P>
<P>
John Zolezzi, who was 81 when he died in April, a believer in the family 
tradition, never would have believed this. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd probably be glad not to be around to see it," says John Zolezzi III. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, I don't think he would have wanted to see it," adds John Zolezzi 
Jr. "He wouldn't have believed it." 
</P>
<P>
After four generations, beginning after the turn of the century, like many of 
the tuna fishing Italian- and Portuguese-American families in San Diego, the 
Zolezzis have sold their tuna seiners. Those are the boats with the huge purse 
seine nets that major tuna canners have said they no longer will accept as a 
method of catching tuna because it also can kill dolphin that follow schools of 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
When the purchase papers were signed Friday after months of negotiations, 
another bit of San Diego tradition died. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Yap, an island nation in the western Pacific, bought the Mary 
Antoinette from John Jr. and John III and the Marietta from Julius Zolezzi, 
John Jr.'s brother. 
</P>
<P>
From a high of more than 250 tuna boats years ago, the number of San 
Diego-based vessels has dwindled as the U.S. tuna fishing and canning industry 
dies, taken over by foreign fishing fleets and canneries as a result of 
environmental and economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 tuna seiners still are owned by San Diego entities, but only a few 
actually use San Diego as a base of operation, and those vessels are expected 
to be sold soon. 
</P>
<P>
From a business that supported generations of Portuguese and Italian families, 
tuna fishing in San Diego has been reduced to this: a few boats, plain, simple, 
weathered workhorses of the ocean, tied up at the Embarcadero. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer economical for these guys and their 
</P>
<P>
families," says August Felando, president since 1960 of the San Diego-based 
American Tunaboat Assn. "All the jobs are going overseas. . . . It bothers me 
that the tuna fishing history here is ending." 
</P>
<P>
As with other tuna fishing families, the economic hammer has fallen hard on the 
Zolezzis and they have little choice but to leave the business, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have known them for years, of course," Felando said, "and it's a shame, but 
it's happening all over. The chances are not too good" that tuna fishing will 
survive in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Like countless men before them, four generations of Zolezzis have spent their 
lives at sea. The old-timers stood in the racks along the sides of the boats on 
the open ocean, rolling waist-deep in the sea, using bamboo poles like pistons 
-- dip and pull, dip and pull -- to snatch the fish from the chum-baited 
eastern Pacific until the schools fled into the deep or filled the ship's 
holding tanks and the cycle started anew with someone climbing into the crow's 
nest to search for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
And the younger generations, using the giant nets (purse seines) developed in 
the mid-1960s, working as hard as their great-grandfathers but in different 
ways, still weathering storms, sharks and tedium for months at a time when the 
only thing on the horizon was more horizon and a sun overhead baked their skin 
and etched deep wrinkles in their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The Zolezzi family story is a blue-collar tale rich with hard work, laughter, 
pain and pride, like those of other San Diego tuna families. 
</P>
<P>
John Zolezzi Jr.'s great-grandfather, a fisherman who had emigrated from Italy, 
moved from San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake to San Diego, where he took 
up rock cod fishing and eventually tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Rearing a family in Point Loma, he went to sea, as did his son, John, and 
John's son, John Jr., and his son, John III. John IV, age 9, never got the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves fishing and he might have gone into tuna fishing, but who knows?" his 
father says. "I'd support him in whatever he does." 
</P>
<P>
From humble beginnings after the turn of the century, many local Portuguese- 
and Italian-Americans have earned a good living from tuna fishing, enough to 
reside in affluent Point Loma, whose hills overlook the harbor from which they 
departed. 
</P>
<P>
In his Point Loma house last week, John Jr., retired since 1981, is sitting in 
his home with the view of the bay spread out like a 3-D painting, the brown 
mountains beyond the city, sailboats down in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A private man, big and strong, Zolezzi, 58, is typical of many tuna fishermen 
-- a close-knit bunch, made even tighter by the dolphin controversy, angry at 
being driven out of business (unfairly, they say), still a little shell-shocked 
at losing their way of life, wary of outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Zolezzi talks about the old days of bait or pole fishing when you worked around 
the clock, catching bait, preparing feather flies that resembled squid, using 
bamboo poles and a lot of muscle to catch, move and store the tuna. 
</P>
<P>
He and his brother, Julius, 59, fished when they were boys and started going on 
their father's tuna runs during their high school summers. While they ended up 
captaining their own boats, brother Michael owns a helicopter service that 
spots tuna schools for the big modern boats. 
</P>
<P>
"My family's always owned boats, and I always thought I'd be a fisherman," John 
says. "I liked fishing, but not the time away at sea. Still, it was the best 
way for me to support my family." 
</P>
<P>
He looks like he could tell a million tales, but you can see it on his face: 
He's not much of a talker and he's not a man who dwells on the past, so he 
doesn't know where to begin, how to explain in an hour what it took him a 
lifetime to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real loss to San Diego, this heritage, all the families that came from 
Europe and settled here," Zolezzi says. "It was hard work, but we stuck with 
it; lot of ups and downs, a lot of sacrifice, but good pay. Now it's all dying 
out." 
</P>
<P>
He skips around a lot, touching on memories here and there, the advantages of 
purse seining, with the great nets scooping massive amounts of fish, versus the 
old one-at-a-time bait fishing ("God, more volume!" he says). 
</P>
<P>
"I miss going to sea, but deep down, I don't miss it. If you know what I mean?" 
he says. And later: "Tuna fishing is kind of like farming; you've got to feel 
it, it's got to be in your blood . . . but you've got to learn it, too." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, a little frustrated, he shows an old video of tuna fishing. It 
shows men in crew cuts, maybe early 1960s, wiry arms, breaking their backs with 
bait fishing, slapping the surface with the tips of the long poles, jerking the 
feeding tuna up and over their shoulders onto the boat, filling the belly of 
the ship with tons of fish, one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Zolezzi stands there, smiling. "There," he says, pointing at the screen, "look 
at those guys work. They work hard today, don't get me wrong, but do you think 
you get guys to do that kind of work today? Do you see what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Down at the docks, the Mary Antoinette sits empty. The great black nets are 
piled on the back. Most of the crew has gone, some to tuna fishing jobs with 
foreign or U.S. flagged vessels based in the western Pacific, some taking 
land-based jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The boat's gangplank is not up; despite two big dogs and warning signs, 
tourists try to come aboard as if the seiner is another aquatic museum 
gathering dust. The boats will leave for Yap in 60 days after being remodeled 
to handle heavier loads. 
</P>
<P>
Zolezzi's son, John III, 34, the boat's captain since 1980, has cleared out his 
cabin. The 14-man crew's cabins are empty. The tuna storage tanks are empty. 
The pilot house is empty. The engine room is empty. 
</P>
<P>
The dock is empty, too, except for a few fellow tunamen who come to shoot the 
breeze awhile, everyone waiting for the sale of the boats to go through. 
</P>
<P>
John III, whose brothers also are in the fishing industry, plans to stay in 
tuna fishing, working in the western Pacific with other West Coast tuna-men, 
making the long flight home between fishing trips. He has no specific job lined 
up, but something will turn up, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'll probably go to the other side (of the Pacific)," he says. "Less 
pay, more time away from the family, but you have to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
He holds a cigarette in his hands, which look like meat hooks, like all tuna 
fishermen's hands -- calloused, beaten up, the fingers a little crooked, the 
fingernails battered. He talks about the lure of the sea a little more 
expansively than his father. But not much. 
</P>
<P>
"You've just got to like being out at sea. It's a strain on the family, but I 
have a good wife. You've got to have a good wife," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Down the dock is the Mary Antoinette's sister ship, the Marietta, owned until 
Friday by Julius Zolezzi, John Jr.'s brother. The 165-foot vessels were built 
in 1969. Julius also owns three tuna boats in the western Pacific. Like his 
fishermen brethren, he complains about environmentalists and the public not 
knowing "the real story" about the number of dolphins killed in purse seines, 
how the tuna-men are the true protectors of both of the tuna and dolphin 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But his heart does not seem in the argument in the days following the sale of 
his boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family's been in it for 90 years. When the (sale) papers were signed, I 
was really just kind of numb. . . . It brought back a lot of memories," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
And then a few more memories jump up in his face, and the middle-age fisherman 
chokes up again. 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me, he says. "I'm getting a little emotional. . . . I'm not really 
jumping for joy now that the boat's sold, I'll tell you that."

GANG ACTIVITY SUSPECTED IN SLAYING OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A popular 14-year-old high school girl was fatally shot and a pregnant friend 
was wounded in what Oceanside police said Tuesday might be the city's first 
gang-related killing. 
</P>
<P>
Officer E.J. Luarca said the victims were black and the suspects are believed 
to be Samoan, raising suspicion that the violence might have been sparked by 
gang rivalry between the two ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Tate defied her mother's pleas and went to Alberto's Mexican Food in 
eastern Oceanside on Monday night, leaving the restaurant with several friends 
shortly after 9 p.m. when a car drove up and an occupant opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
A bullet passed through Tate, who was pronounced dead at Tri-City Medical 
Center, and struck Stacey Prince, 17, who was flown by helicopter to Palomar 
Hospital, where she was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before noon Tuesday, Oceanside police had arrested Talofa Finouga Jr., 
19, and were searching for a second suspect, Akeli S. Kelly, 21, both of 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the shooting is gang-related or ethnically motivated," Luarca 
said. If the former, "it's the first gang-related shooting that has resulted in 
the death of a person" in Oceanside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside has had gangs for generations but police warned last year that gang 
activity had escalated with several non-fatal drive-by shootings between the 
Samoan Bloods and the Deep Valley Posse, which is a black gang. 
</P>
<P>
Although police were guarded in their statements, the neighborhood where 
Michele lived in a tract of older, modest stucco homes near Camp Pendleton's 
back gate has been buzzing for days about gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
Michele's mother, Mecaela Tate, comforted by friends and family, said Tuesday 
she had warned her friendly, outgoing daughter to stay away from Redondo Drive 
and North River Road, the commercial and residential area where the shooting 
occurred and which police say is commonly used as a gang hangout. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her time and time again to stay away from there," said Tate, who said 
her daughter didn't belong to a gang but that some of her friends did. 
</P>
<P>
On the day Michele died, she had telephoned her mother at work to say she was 
home sick from school. But while her mother, who is divorced and works two 
jobs, was still at work that evening, the girl left the family's home and ended 
up with her friends at Alberto's. 
</P>
<P>
Tate believes that her daughter, a freshman at El Camino High School, was shot 
by mistake and the assailants meant to kill one of her companions. 
</P>
<P>
"She was at the wrong place at the wrong time. She took the bullet," Tate said. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't do anything wrong, she's innocent," sobbed the mother, adding that 
her daughter "wanted to be a lawyer. How's she going to be a lawyer if she's 
dead?" 
</P>
<P>
Tate said Michele was friendly to a fault, often inviting homeless children to 
spend the night in their home. She was loyal to friends, some of them gang 
members, and seemed unaware that her association could bring her harm, said her 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Sources believe the bullet could have been meant for one of Michele's 
companions, which included two males whom police have not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Tate's neighborhood have worried for days about increasing gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
One area resident, who asked not to be identified, said there has been some 
gang activity in the past, but that random shots were heard last Friday and 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Although nobody was injured, "this was new for this end of the valley," said 
the woman. "Everybody knows it's gangs. Everybody was told by gang members and 
the cops to stay in at night." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Oceanside Unified School District administrators ordered extra 
security at El Camino High, which Michele had attended for only a month, and 
provided psychologists who help students having emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether it (the shooting) was random or not, but we're treating 
it with a great deal of caution," said district spokesman Dan Armstrong. "If 
there's a neighborhood in turmoil, we don't want it to spill into El Camino." 
</P>
<P>
The district placed unarmed guards at the school's entrances to check everybody 
coming and leaving, prohibiting strangers and "making sure they have legitimate 
business on campus," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the mood on campus was "tense and somber," with some students 
"wondering if it's an isolated thing or a precursor to other incidents." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tate hadn't attended the high school for long, she had already made an 
impression. One of her teachers, Sherilyn Gazso, said, "Michele was very sweet 
and extremely friendly." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, before she left Lincoln Junior High School, a yearbook indicated 
that Tate had been voted "most humorous" by her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside police said Tuesday that many pieces are missing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Luarca said authorities are not sure what kind of weapon 
was used, how many rounds were fired or what all the injuries were. Police 
suspect a handgun was used, but there were unsubstantiated reports a shotgun 
was the weapon. Police believe the suspects were driving a 1984 blue and white 
Oldsmobile Cutlass. 
</P>
<P>
Police didn't say why Finouga and Kelly are suspects or what the motive may 
have been in the shooting.

PLAN OKD TO MAKE DEVELOPMENT HELP PAY WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to find a way to make development "pay for itself," the San Diego City 
Council will make builders begin paying a new fee to finance roads, libraries 
and other public facilities needed because of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
In what has become an almost annual legislative exercise to grapple with one of 
the thorniest issues in San Diego politics, the council narrowly passed a plan 
late Monday night that establishes so-called "citywide impact fees" designed to 
recover part of the costs of streets, parks, fire and police stations and other 
public facilities necessitated by growth. 
</P>
<P>
A watered-down version of a tougher proposal debated last summer, the 
growth-control program also promotes efforts to improve air quality and 
encourages the preservation of hillsides and wetlands as open space. 
</P>
<P>
But the council disappointed some environmentalists, and Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, by rejecting the boldest component of the growth proposal: a 
controversial plan to limit future development by linking building permits to 
strict standards for traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, I would have liked it stronger, but the votes weren't there," 
O'Connor said of the plan, approved by a 5-3 vote. "It would have been an 
extremely strong program if we'd gotten the transportation (limits). But we got 
75% of what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders, who had warned that some of the stringent restrictions 
originally proposed would worsen the problems posed by the nationwide economic 
downturn, also were generally pleased with the compromise. In recognition of 
economic conditions, the council agreed to phase in the impact fees -- 
estimated to raise more than $850 million during the next two decades -- over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"They generally went in the direction we had asked," said Wayne Raffesberger, 
executive director of San Diegans Inc., a downtown business group. "It's a 
good, balanced plan I think most people can live with." 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth activist Peter Navarro called the fees only a "modest and partial 
solution to San Diego's pressing growth problems." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike existing fees charged to developers and home buyers to help finance the 
schools, parks and branch libraries in their particular neighborhood, the new 
assessments are designed to collect revenue needed for facilities such as 
police stations, a central library and open space that serve the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's five-hour debate followed the now-familiar script from San 
Diego's earlier growth battles, with some environmentalists pressing for 
tougher growth controls than those being debated as developers and business 
leaders issued doomsday warnings about the measures under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
If some of the strictest proposals were adopted, opponents cautioned, tens of 
thousands of jobs would be lost, housing costs would soar, retailers ranging 
from supermarkets to gas stations would abandon the city for surrounding 
communities, and residential and industrial development would be severely 
curtailed, thereby reducing the fees' estimated revenue. Over the next month, a 
council committee will consider exempting certain businesses from the fees, 
which will begin being assessed in 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists said failure to toughen existing growth standards would 
worsen air quality and traffic problems while delaying an inevitable request 
for the additional funds needed for public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a real simple choice: Is the money going to come from developers or 
taxpayers?" said Richard Carson, economic adviser to the slow-growth group 
Prevent Los Angelization Now. 
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year phase-in for the new fees, the charges will be discounted 
75% the first year, 50% the second year and 25% the third year. 
</P>
<P>
That discount schedule, supporters said, would help to soften the fees' impact 
on developers at a time when the nation's economy appears to be entering a 
recession. But Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer complained that it could prompt a 
spurt in "helter-skelter, willy-nilly" development as builders rushed to take 
advantage of the discounts. 
</P>
<P>
During the first year, the new fees, which will be imposed both on residential 
and commercial development, are estimated at about $1,100 for single-family 
homes and 95 cents per square foot for industrial projects, according to city 
planners. Because those dollar amounts represent the 75% discount, the full 
fees -- which, in the absence of future council action would be imposed in late 
1993 -- equal about $4,400 and $3.90 per square foot, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
With the nation's economy already acting as a brake on development, the 
additional burden of the new fees, Councilman Ron Roberts argued, could further 
drive up housing expenses and discourage businesses from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet there's not another city in the country discussing increasing 
development fees at this point," said Roberts, who was joined by Councilmen Bob 
Filner and Bruce Henderson in opposing the plan. With Councilman Wes Pratt 
absent due to illness, the plan's backers included O'Connor, Wolfsheimer, John 
Hartley, Linda Bernhardt and Judy McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected proposal to link building permits to traffic levels drew strong 
condemnation from developers and council members alike, who argued that it 
would perpetuate the city's dependence on automobiles while doing little or 
nothing to improve air quality.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ALPINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old man was in serious condition Tuesday at Sharp Memorial Hospital 
after being shot by a sheriff's deputy Monday night on the Viejas Indian 
Reservation, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Grijalva was shot once in his abdomen by Deputy Michael Tverberg during a 
family disturbance call on Viejas Grade Road, a Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at Grijalva's residence on the reservation, about three 
miles east of Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
Tverberg and two other deputies responding to the call at 6:30 p.m. Monday were 
told that an intoxicated man with weapons was threatening to shoot a woman in 
the home, the spokesman said. Tverberg established voice contact with Grijalva, 
who was verbally abusive and told Tverberg he had already killed Beverly Jane 
Cantwell, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tverberg forcibly entered the home and Grijalva reacted in a way that made the 
officer fear for his safety and he fired one shot, the spokesman said. Grijalva 
was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell apparently had fled to a nearby residence prior to the deputies 
arrival, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Other details of the shooting were not available and an investigation is 
continuing, the spokesman said.

DAILY BRIEFINGS ON SERIAL KILLINGS HALTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police have decided to suspend daily press briefings in connection 
with the serial killing of five women in Clairemont and University City, Capt. 
Dick Toneck announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a briefing outside police headquarters, Toneck said investigators are 
pursuing more than 1,700 tips but that not enough new information has surfaced 
to warrant regular meetings with the media. 
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic, we have a lot of leads to work on and we're working them 
daily," Toneck said. "We still want more. We're still asking the public to come 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Toneck said he did "not have exact numbers," but said the number of 
investigators working the case has declined from last week's peak of 27 
detectives and seven senior officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said the large volume of leads has been helpful in solidifying the composite 
of the suspect, who is said to be a black male of unknown nationality, 5-foot-7 
to 5-foot-10, with a medium build and dark, close-cropped hair. 
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating, Toneck said, "There's a good possibility this person may 
have been a Peeping Tom, has been involved with indecent exposure in the past 
and may or may not have a criminal record." 
</P>
<P>
He said no outside law enforcement officials have been brought into the case, 
but reiterated that the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., was primarily responsible 
for putting together a psychological profile of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
"This person is probably a loner," Toneck said. "He does not like authority and 
probably handles menial jobs, if he has a job. He's not great at interpersonal 
relationships and probably has a high school education at best." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is wanted in connection with these killings: 
</P>
<P>
* Tiffany Paige Schultz, a 20-year-old San Diego State University student, 
found stabbed to death in her Clairemont apartment in the 3100 block of Cowley 
Way on Jan. 12.

<P>
It's home sweet home today for place-kicker John Carney. 
</P>
<P>
"I signed a six-month lease for an apartment in Rancho Bernardo back in April," 
he said. "I guess I was a little optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Just good planning. 
</P>
<P>
Carney today will re-sign the two-year contract he accepted as a Plan B free 
agent with the Chargers in April, and will replace Fuad Reveiz, who was 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers released Carney in August after he fell behind Reveiz in a 
training camp match race to become the team's kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," Carney said. "Instead of breaking our lease and paying the 
penalty, my wife and I decided to stay here and see what happened. This is 
another great opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Carney heard from the Chargers before the game with Cleveland, but went ahead 
and signed with the Rams when Mike Lansford suffered a leg injury that kept him 
from kicking off. 
</P>
<P>
"I got four kickoffs with the Rams and that was great," Carney said. "I was 
released the next day, and Sunday night I got a call from the Chargers telling 
me they were going to bring me in. 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz missed field goals of 45 and 27 yards earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very badly for him," Carney said. "But it's like Fuad said, 'It's all 
part of the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carney kicked for Notre Dame before being signed as a replacement player by 
Tampa Bay during the NFL's 1987 strike. He kicked in four games for the Bucs in 
1988, and for one game in 1989 in relief of an injured Donald Igwebuike. 
</P>
<P>
He was six for six in PATs, and was two for five in field-goal attempts with a 
long attempt of 29 yards. Two of his field-goal attempts were blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed when things didn't work out in training camp because I felt 
I had kicked well," Carney said. "It's one of those things, though, where you 
have to keep your head up and wait for something to open up. I'm just very 
happy to be back." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will have to release a player today or place someone on injured 
reserve because of the signing of Carney. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers signed 6-3, 300-pound defensive tackle Tony Savage Tuesday to 
replace the injured 6-5, 315-pound Joe Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was injured in an altercation outside of a Mission Beach restaurant a 
week ago and will be out for two months. 
</P>
<P>
Savage was a fifth-round pick of the Jets from Washington State and officially 
takes Reveiz's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
The club also announced the signing of practice squad wide receiver Dempsey 
Norman. Norman, a 5-7, 175-pound speedster from the College of St. Francis, was 
an 11th-round choice of the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said he expects starting safety Vencie Glenn to be recovered 
sufficiently from a concussion to play against Pittsburgh Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, however, doesn't look for wide receiver Nate Lewis, who suffered a 
pulled quadriceps, and defensive back Joe Fuller, who pulled a hamstring, to be 
ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Burt Grossman, who went down twice against the Oilers with pain 
in his neck, "will play," Henning said. "He'll be sore all week, but he'll go." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers have yet to score on offense this season, and Henning was asked if 
he thought they might simplify things in an effort to end the drought. 
</P>
<P>
"When you haven't scored a touchdown in four games," he said, "maybe you're too 
simple." T.J. SIMERS

SAMUEL'S SINGLE IN 10TH GIVES DODGERS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers clinched second place in style Tuesday night before 22,883 at 
Dodger Stadium, while the San Diego Padres added another lousy night to a 
chilling season. 
</P>
<P>
It took 10 innings, but the Dodgers defeated the Padres, 8-7, after a wild 
comeback in the eighth and a game-winning rally in the 10th. The Padres remain 
tied for fourth with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers needed just four batters in the 10th inning against Craig Lefferts 
(7-5). Mike Sharperson led off with a single to right, Eddie Murray came next 
with another single to right and Hubie Brooks was intentionally walked to load 
the bases. Juan Samuel followed with a single to center, scoring Sharperson 
with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
It all looked so easy against a pitcher with whom the Dodgers have had loads of 
trouble. Lifetime against the Dodgers, Lefferts was 9-0 with five saves and a 
2.04 earned-run average. But on this night, the Dodgers weren't to be 
restrained by the usual. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by four, 6-2, with two out and none on in the bottom of the eighth, 
the Dodgers suddenly came to life. They scored five runs on a walk, four 
singles and an error to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The shenanigans started when Padre starter Dennis Rasmussen walked Jose 
Gonzalez, and then wild pitched him to second. Mike Sharperson followed with a 
single to center, allowing Gonzalez to score to bring the Dodgers to within 
6-3. Rasmussen went to a full-count on the next batter, Eddie Murray, before 
Murray lined a single to left, sending Sharperson to third and Padre Manager 
Greg Riddoch to the mound. Exit Rasmussen; enter Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Hubie Brooks lined Lefferts' first pitch into right field, allowing 
Sharperson to score and Murray to take third. Juan Samuel followed with a 
grounder to second, but Joey Cora bobbled it and then threw it away. Murray 
scored, Brooks went to third and Samuel made it to second. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Mickey Hatcher, pinch-hitting for reliever Jim Gott. He laced a 
single into right, scoring both Brooks and Samuel. Lefferts then struck out 
Offerman, but it was too late. Dodgers, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? Jay Howell, who replaced Gott, got two quick outs on the 
Padres -- and then the Padres staged a two-out rally of their own to tie the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark -- who was eligible because he decided to appeal a one-game 
suspensiion earlier in the day -- Joe Carter and Mike Pagliarulo singled 
consecutively, and, presto, it was 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Jack Clark decided to appeal his one-game suspension. He was not 
in the starting line-up Tuesday -- the day he was to serve the suspension -- 
but he was available to pinch-hit. National League President Bill White 
suspended Clark for one game Monday because of an incident in San Francisco 
last Wednesday during which Clark was ejected and subsequently picked up and 
threw first base. White will likely rule on the appeal during the off-season. 
If the suspension is upheld, it will take place next season. . . . The Padres 
have lost another player for the season. Pitcher Greg Harris left the team -- 
with Manager Greg Riddoch's permission -- before Monday's game to be with his 
family in North Carolina after the death of his grandfather.

The Del Mar city council gave organizers of the San Diego Marathon two weeks to 
devise a suitable traffic-control plan, thus breathing life into a race which 
last week appeared doomed when city managers of three cities denied it 
special-use permits. 
</P>
<P>
If organizers can find a solution to a Sherriff's manpower shortage and can 
allow for residents West of Old Highway 101 -- over which the race will be run 
on Dec. 9 -- to get around runners, then the council will overturn the city 
manager's decision, according to Lynn Flanagan, race director. 
</P>
<P>
If Del Mar reverses its city manager's decision, Flanagan hopes the councils of 
Solana Beach and Encinitas will do the same. The three cities contract for 
service through the same Sherriff's substation in Encinitas. JOHN GEIS

JAMES FLANIGAN: HEALTH CARE SUFFERS UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The buck doesn't stop here," said last weekend's budget negotiators, in 
effect, as they cut funding for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
The budgeteers from the Bush Administration and Congress dictated lower 
Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors and higher premiums on Medicare 
insurance for the elderly, subject to congressional approval. But they avoided 
higher taxes on Social Security income. 
</P>
<P>
Which raises questions of just why politicians would cut a health program for 
the elderly but refrain from taxing an income program. 
</P>
<P>
And the reason is that with Medicare the negotiators knew they could pass the 
buck. The reductions in projected federal expenditure during the next five 
years -- totaling $60 billion -- would be made up largely by increased payments 
from employer-financed insurance programs for retirees and by the practice of 
cost shifting, in which hospitals charge fully insured patients more to make up 
for Medicare and indigent patients paying less. 
</P>
<P>
"The average hospital loss on Medicare is $136 per patient," say Washington 
consultants Thomas Gilligan and Allen Dobson in Federation of American Health 
Systems Review, a publication that monitors legislative trends. It is simply 
understood that shortfalls on Medicare are made up by overbilling other 
patients, the authors write. And with new reductions in Medicare, "the 
shortfall in Medicare payments could rise to approximately $450 per patient." 
</P>
<P>
"The budget agreement is just a continuation of government underpayments," 
agrees Kenneth Abramowitz, analyst at the Sanford C. Bernstein investment firm. 
"Business will see its health-care premiums go up 15% to 20% a year, forever." 
</P>
<P>
Skyrocketing costs, false billing, political sleight of hand: Medical financing 
in America seems at times to be a bizarre game of cat and mouse. For example, 
the government 10 years ago introduced a system of specific payments for 
specific treatments or illnesses in an attempt to control its costs. Private 
health insurers introduced similar cost-containment moves, and the system 
worked. Government outlays for hospital care only doubled in the 1980s, as 
hospital stays were shorter and more ailments were treated on an outpatient 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
But payments to physicians and for outpatient services went through the roof. 
Expenditures on Medicare, the largest of the government's health programs, 
trebled in the '80s to roughly $90 billion. And the outlook is for Medicare and 
other health expenditures to simply balloon as the average American grows 
older. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's health as well as its pocketbook is threatened by the present 
system of medical financing. Business and insurance groups are calling 
attention to "over-practice." As much as "30% of heart bypass, angioplasties, 
prostate gland removals, Cesarean sections and pacemaker implants have been 
deemed unnecessary," stated a Cleveland business group, citing work by medical 
researchers at UCLA and RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Such over-practice occurs, the business groups say, because health insurance 
and government programs pay on quantity of work done; to get the bucks, you 
have to take action. Also, patients demand action in the form of the latest 
diagnostic tests and medical procedures, and advancing medical technology 
properly encourages patient and physician to search for new answers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a complex situation, but one that cries out for reform, says Henry Aaron, 
a scholar at the Brookings Institution. And the latest Medicare cuts, by 
increasing business' health insurance costs and hiking premiums on Medigap 
insurance -- by which the elderly cover the difference between Medicare 
payments and medical bills -- will only hasten reform. At least they will 
hasten a national debate over health care. 
</P>
<P>
And that debate might consider Cleveland, where 10 major corporations and a 
coalition of small companies are supporting a program called Cleveland Health 
Quality Choice to monitor local hospitals. The business groups judge hospitals 
on how well patients respond to treatment, depending on their illness. The aim 
is to identify the better performing hospitals and persuade employees to use 
them. The result will ultimately be that some hospitals will close and others 
will specialize, says Dale Shaller, a consultant to the Cleveland group. One 
hospital might specialize in pediatrics, while another offers intensive cancer 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Such reforms may be closer than we think. Business is in no mood to accept 
further hikes in medical bills -- already one of industry's highest single 
costs. "The United States now spends $600 billion a year on health care," says 
Powell Woods, president of Cleveland's health action group. "That's twice the 
health expenditure per person of nations such as Germany and Japan. And you 
have to ask whether the U.S. is getting its money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is clear: Either private efforts such as Cleveland's provide a 
solution to rising costs, or corporations, labor unions and voters will turn in 
the '90s to federal financing of health care. 
</P>
<P>
And make no mistake, federal financing in this day and age won't be generous. 
Rather, it will surely include rationing of health care. 
</P>
<P>
The budget negotiators don't know it, but the time has past for passing the 
buck on health care.

MANY SAY THEY WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SWALLOW GAS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a Mobil service station in downtown Los Angeles, Michael Pracha leaned 
against his black station wagon Tuesday and watched with resignation as the 
electronic digits tallied his gasoline bill with dizzying speed: $23, $24, $25. 
</P>
<P>
For Pracha, 36, who drives as many as 800 miles a week in his job as a garment 
industry production manager, there is nothing abstract about the proposed 
12-cent-a-gallon tax hike that is part of the federal deficit-reduction 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad," he said between bites of an ice cream sandwich. "But again, there's 
nothing you can do. You still have to go to work, you have to travel and you 
have to pay the extra money." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed federal gasoline tax would come on the heels of a 
27.1-cent-a-gallon increase that has raised the average price of regular 
unleaded gasoline to $1.346 a gallon since the crisis in the Persian Gulf 
began, according to the American Automobile Assn. In California, price 
increases have included a 5-cent-a-gallon voter-approved state tax hike that 
went into effect Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed federal tax would place a further burden on motorists, 
particularly low-income consumers, and squeeze service station operators, 
critics said. The tax, which would be phased in incrementally, has drawn fire 
from consumer groups, service station organizations, petroleum marketers and 
the automobile association, which called it "reckless public policy in the face 
of a recession." 
</P>
<P>
Observers say a new federal tax would cut demand for gasoline only slightly. 
Within a year, it would drop 1% to 1.5% from its current level of 7.7 million 
barrels a day, economists estimated. Still, at around 100,000 barrels a day, 
"that's no small potatoes," said Gary N. Ross, president of Petroleum Industry 
Research Associates of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists have already cut gasoline consumption and altered their driving 
habits. "I'm driving less and making more use of my time when I'm on the road," 
said Ed Rodieck, 25, an Orange businessman who drives 60 to 90 miles a day. 
"I'm starting to ride-share a lot more . . . (And when I'm in downtown Los 
Angeles), I do a lot more walking . . . and take the DASH bus." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who can't cut back stand to suffer the most, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't ride-share with anybody," said Gerry Walling, a 43-year-old legal 
librarian from Monrovia who drives 45 to 130 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to have my own car because of my obligations to go to other offices," 
she said as she filled her tank at a Unocal station downtown. So far, she 
added, the price hike "hasn't affected my family (financially). But it may. I 
don't know how it's going to affect us if it keeps going up." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a regressive tax," said Nicholas Fedoruk of the consumer group Citizen 
Action in Washington. "It has the largest impact on the low- and middle-income 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists would not be the only ones to suffer. The tax could add to service 
station owners' costs of processing credit card transactions, cut sales volumes 
and increase cash flow requirements, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Weiss, who owns Bob's Chevron in Anaheim, said the price run-ups in the 
past two months have turned motorists away. His sales volumes have fallen by 
15%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although prices are higher, he says his per-gallon gross profit margin, out of 
which he pays rent and overhead, has actually shrunk. "The lower our volumes 
go, the more rent we pay" to Chevron, he added. Higher taxes will drive away 
even more customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Weiss said he has not suffered serious financial problems, others 
might not be so lucky. The tax "affects the marginal dealer," said Stephen 
Shelton, executive director of the Southern California Service Station Assn. in 
Irvine.

IN STRATEGY SHIFT, APPLE TO UNVEIL 3 LOW-COST MACS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer executives disclosed Tuesday that the company has fundamentally 
altered its product strategy, offering three new machines in an effort to 
become a high-volume, low-priced vendor. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than charging premium prices and settling for a small but highly 
profitable customer base -- a longstanding approach that has drawn increasing 
criticism from customers and industry analysts -- Apple will cut the cost of 
its flagship Macintosh computer almost in half in an effort to increase sales 
volume and bring in a new generation of first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple used to be the computer for everybody, and then it became a machine for 
the corporate market," said Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative 
Strategies, a personal computer research firm. "They're getting back to their 
basic market." 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the revamped strategy will be a new line of Macintosh 
computers to be unveiled Oct. 15. Although Apple has long been expected to 
introduce a cheaper Macintosh, the company has gone further than anticipated by 
introducing three new machines that replace much of its current product line, 
and altering its basic strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Apple's aggressive move is in part a response to Windows, a new software system 
that gives the widely used International Business Machines-compatible personal 
computers many of the easy-to-use features that originally made the Macintosh 
popular. Analysts say countering Windows is critical if Apple is to remain a 
major player in the $25-billion personal computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
And the new strategy, which comes at a time when many computer vendors are 
slashing prices to spur slow sales, also indicates that Apple has recognized 
the need for a broader customer base in the escalating war to establish desktop 
computing standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic goal is to gain market share," said Apple Chairman and Chief 
Executive John Sculley, who discussed the new strategy in a breakfast meeting 
with reporters. "We are going to take lower margins. We need to get unit growth 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Apple, the first company to make the personal computer a mass-market product, 
has long been fighting a lone battle against the IBM-compatible machines. Those 
PCs have traditionally used a software system called DOS, developed by 
Microsoft, to control the basic functions of the machine. The brains behind the 
systems are microprocessors from Intel. 
</P>
<P>
The IBM/DOS/Intel design became a de facto standard in part because the 
so-called clone makers were able to make the machines cheaply and thus 
encouraged broad sales. Software developers rushed to write programs for the 
widely distributed computers, and corporations who wanted standardized products 
bought them en masse. 
</P>
<P>
The Apple Macintosh, introduced in 1984, was generally considered more powerful 
and easier to use than the DOS machines and achieved a loyal following despite 
its high price and the fact that it could not communicate or share information 
with the IBM-compatible machines. A strategy put in place by Sculley in 1985 to 
sell the Macintosh to corporate America was more successful than many expected, 
but the Apple model still claims only about 8% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Apple's growth has slowed, and customers have grown 
increasingly restless with pricing that gave Apple gross margins of more than 
50%. And the DOS standard has begun to fracture: IBM is promoting a replacement 
for DOS called OS/2, while Microsoft is pushing Windows, which works on 
high-end DOS machines. Both OS/2 and Windows emulate many of the Macintosh's 
features. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the UNIX operating system, which has traditionally been used only 
on powerful engineering and scientific computers, is growing increasingly 
popular on cheaper desktop systems. Sun Microsystems, which has pushed the 
price of powerful engineering workstations below the $10,000 level, is now 
considered a long-term strategic competitor in personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three places where people are trying to build something -- Bellevue 
(Washington, near Microsoft's headquarters), Mountain View, (Calif. home of 
Sun) and Cupertino (home of Apple)," said Michael Spindler, the former head of 
Apple's European operations who was promoted to chief operating officer earlier 
this year. "Everyone else is just peddling." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have long speculated that Apple might eventually be forced to license 
the Macintosh design and operating system -- as IBM/Microsoft and Sun have 
done. That would allow clone-vendors to make cheap Macintoshes and expand the 
machine's base, which would in turn encourage software companies to write 
programs for it and make it more of a standard. 
</P>
<P>
But instead, Apple has chosen to offer cheap machines itself and is counting on 
its ability to build them as efficiently as any clone-maker could. Sculley and 
Spindler both emphasized on Tuesday that the company had put a great deal of 
effort into cutting production costs at its highly automated factories in 
California, Singapore and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
The new products to be introduced Oct. 15 include an entry-level machine, about 
equivalent to the current Macintosh SE, that is expected to cost about $1,000 
in its cheapest version and $1,500 with a hard disk drive. The "street" prices 
and prices charged to educational institutions will probably be several hundred 
dollars lower. 
</P>
<P>
A new color Macintosh will be priced at about $2,500, and a second color 
product -- featuring a faster microprocessor and more expandability -- is 
expected to cost about $4,000. The prices are about half what one would have to 
pay for comparable power and speed in the current Macintosh product line. 
</P>
<P>
The new products will replace much of Apple's current low- and mid-range 
product line, but the company will remain committed to the Mac IIci and the Mac 
IIfx as its high-performance machines. 
</P>
<P>
Apple will not comment on the pricing or characteristics of the new products, 
though they have already been shown to thousands of computer dealers, software 
developers and consultants. Sculley said Apple will spend $40 million, mostly 
on advertising, to promote the new line.

Milken Profits May be Reclaimed: Drexel Burnham Lambert and its primary 
creditors won a court order giving them access to records of an accounting firm 
used by investors in the firm's junk-bond partnerships. They say some of the 
profits that former junk-bond king Michael Milken and other Drexel employees 
made in the partnerships should be returned to the bankrupt firm's estate.

American to Drop John Wayne-S.F. Service: American Airlines said that, as a 
result of a decision to drop British Aerospace 146 aircraft from its fleet, it 
is halting service between Orange County and San Francisco, effective Nov. 1. 
M. E. Olsen, American's vice president for capacity planning, said the airline 
wasn't making money on the route. American's withdrawal turns control of the 
market between Orange County and San Francisco over to USAir, which has eight 
flights a day between the two points.

Corrections Corp. of America and Wackenhut Corrections Corp. recently became 
the first private operators to bid on a maximum security state prison. The 
state corrections department has stated that the successful bidder must operate 
the prison at 10% below the state's cost. The state Legislature has also 
authorized a smaller prison to be operated by a private company. CCA operates 
18 prisons in other states. A company executive believes that the percentage of

High-Yield Fiber: Louisiana farmers are encouraged by the commercial success of 
a Kenaf, a hybrid relative of okra and cotton. The plant grows to 10 feet in 
about 150 days and has been used in this country mainly as a newsprint 
material. It makes stronger, whiter paper than wood pulp without as much 
bleaching. With new harvesting methods, Kenaf soon will be in use for fiber 
mats for grass, carpets, auto door panels, burlap and rope. In another form, 
Kenaf can be made into animal bedding chips that are more absorbent and cheaper 
than wood. Growers are researching the use of Kenaf as a fiber source in food 
and as an absorbent filler for diapers. Sunday Advocate

Pacific Bell Proposes Rate Cut: The proposed $73.3-million rate reduction would 
lower the average residential customer's bill by 28 cents a month beginning in 
January. The reduction, part of the California Public Utilities Commission's 
"incentive regulation" plan adopted a year ago, if approved would appear on 
customers' bills as an increase in the credit that they have been receiving for 
the past three years.

Blue chip stock prices fell Tuesday as traders took profits and computer-driven 
selling programs kicked in after sharp rises earlier in the day and on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 10.64 points to 2,505.20, after soaring 
63.36 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But most broader indexes rose slightly, and advancing issues outnumbered 
declines 1,014 to 582 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was a 
relatively heavy 188.32 million shares, compared to 202.21 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A morning rise on Wall Street was fed by lower oil prices and a 13% surge on 
the Tokyo stock market. The Dow was up as much as 30 points as crude oil for 
November delivery fell $3 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But selling kicked stocks lower later, as worries about the financial system 
once again rattled the market. Traders also were generally wary of the budget 
deal cut by the White House and congressional leaders. A number of congressmen 
have voiced loud opposition to the proposal to cut the federal deficit by $500 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Primerica dropped 1 1/4 to 18 1/2 after trading as low as 16 7/8. The 
financial services company was hit by new rumors of credit problems, though it 
said all of its key units would post healthy third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Financial worries also pummeled Unisys shares. The troubled stock plunged 1 1/8 
to 3 7/8 after analysts expressed disappointment with the firm's announcement 
of a new computer systems strategy. Later, Moody's downgraded Unisys' debt. 
</P>
<P>
* Drug and food stocks, which led Monday's rally, were mixed. Bristol Myers 
lost 1/2 to 60 1/4 and Merck fell 1 to 79 1/4, while Kellogg gained 1 to 66 1/4 
and Quaker Oats slipped 5/8 to 45 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Some industrial stocks caught buyers' interest, despite continued recession 
fears. Monsanto rose 1 5/8 to 42 5/8, Tenneco gained 1 1/2 to 49 5/8 and Nucor 
jumped 1 3/4 to 60 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Polaroid rose 2 5/8 to 33 1/8. The company declined comment on its stock 
activity. However, it said no decision had been reached in the patent 
infringement case between itself and Eastman Kodak. Kodak fell 1 5/8 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
* Some high-tech stocks were hard hit by analyst downgrades. Autodesk lost 4 
3/4 to 39 3/4, Software Toolworks plunged 2 7/8 to 4 3/8, and Sun Microsystems 
dropped 1 3/4 to 22 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Some recent laggards attracted buyers. Times Mirror jumped 2 1/8 to 25 3/4, 
Carter Hawley gained 3/8 to 3 3/8, J.C. Penney added 1 5/8 to 45 and Time 
Warner rose 1 3/8 to 73 7/8.

Bond Prices Jump as Oil Costs Drop 
</P>
<P>
Anti-inflationary signals from a sharp drop in oil prices boosted government 
bond prices in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond gained 7/32 point, or $2.19 for every $1,000 in face 
amount, after surging more than $10 on Monday. Its yield edged down to 8.82% 
from 8.84% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But there was still no sign from the Federal Reserve that it is prepared to 
lower interest rates to help prop up the economy. Traders have been expecting 
relief in the wake of the White House budget-cutting deal with congressional 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from Monday.

after gaining overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at 1.549 German marks, down from Monday's close of 1.557, 
and at 136.72 Japanese yen, down from 136.75.

gains on the Japanese stock market and improved confidence in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans were higher; cattle futures 
were lower and pork futures were sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
October gold rose $2.50 to $389.10 an ounce on the Comex. Silver settled 3.9 
cents higher at $4.68 an ounce for October.

Stocks soared here to close with record one-day gains Tuesday as cheaper oil 
prices and government measures to support a flagging market boosted investor 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index charted its largest single-day gain in both percentage and 
point terms after authorities Monday revealed steps to support a market that 
had plummeted for five straight days. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index surged 2,676.55 points, or 13.24%, to 22,898.41, 
after plunging 761.64 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at a market that has fallen from 500 to over 1,000 points every 
day for the past week," said Daniel Marull, a trader at Sanyo Securities Ltd. 
"The market needed a rebound." 
</P>
<P>
By the close of the morning trading session today, the Nikkei was up an 
additional 331.16 points, or 1.45%. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also soared in Frankfurt, Germany, in busy trading as a series of 
positive factors brushed aside the worries about the Persian Gulf that have 
weighed on the market for weeks. Dealers reported strong buy orders. The U.S. 
budget news was the major factor in the sharp upturn. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-share DAX index closed Tuesday at 1,444.89, up 24.16 points, or 1.74%.

Share prices also finished higher on the London Stock Exchange, but failed to 
sustain their best levels.

AUGUST SALES OF NEW HOMES DECLINE 1.4%

<P>
Higher interest rates and consumer fears about the future drove new-home sales 
down 1.4% in August, leaving sales 24% lower than at the same time last year, 
the Commerce Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts said the sales tumble was not as sharp as they had 
feared, given the dose of bad news about the Middle East and oil prices during 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
But they predicted that sales would drop further. 
</P>
<P>
August sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 550,000 single-family 
homes, down from 719,000 in the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
The August sales decline followed a revised 0.2% fall in July from June's 
level. The July decline was originally reported as a 2.3% drop. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, the surprise is that sales didn't fall further," said Dick Peach, 
an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Assn., adding that rising interest rates 
may have encouraged some people to buy now rather than risk a higher-cost 
mortgage later. 
</P>
<P>
Peach noted that a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that was available at 9.8% on 
July 27 rose steadily to 10% by Aug. 10 and to 10.2% by Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"As often happens, when rates move up there is an actual increase in sales 
initially," he added. Analysts say this is because home buyers seeing rates 
starting to creep up try to buy quickly to lock in a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
But in the long run, rising interest rates discourage buyers or disqualify them 
because they cannot afford the payments. 
</P>
<P>
The only region where sales rose was in the West, which saw a slim 0.7% rise to 
a rate of 139,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Northeast, where problems with many real estate loans have been 
reported, were flat at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 77,000 in August. 
</P>
<P>
Sales dropped from July levels in the Midwest, by 3.2% to a rate of 91,000, and 
were down 2% in the South to 244,000 houses. 
</P>
<P>
The August sales total of new homes before seasonal adjustment was unchanged 
from July at 47,000 units. In the first eight months of 1990, actual sales fell 
14% to 400,000 homes.

<P>
First Executive Corp., the troubled Los Angeles-based life insurance holding 
company, notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it may soon call 
a special meeting of shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In telephone interviews, however, company officials refused to say why. William 
C. Adams, senior vice president for corporate services, said: "It wouldn't be 
appropriate for us to make any comment." Securities analysts who follow First 
Executive said they weren't aware of plans for such a meeting and said they 
didn't know of specific developments that would warrant one. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive held its regular annual meeting of shareholders on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
A computerized index at the SEC's headquarters in Washington showed that 
preliminary proxy material for a special meeting was filed with the SEC late 
last week. However, preliminary proxy material normally isn't made public by 
the SEC, and The Times was unable to obtain a copy late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to First Executive said the SEC filing doesn't specify a date 
for the meeting, and said it isn't certain that one will be called. "What it's 
in relation to is tentative at the moment," the individual said, but declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive is the parent of two large life insurance companies, Executive 
Life, which principally serves the California market, and Executive Life of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The company invested very heavily in junk bonds during the 1980s and recently 
has suffered severe losses as the junk bond market plummeted. The company has 
said in public filings that it may soon have to stop making dividend payments 
on several issues of preferred stock and warned that the parent company might 
not be able to continue meeting its debt obligations because regulators are 
preventing the insurance units from passing on profits to the parent. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive earlier this year said it had hired the investment banking firm 
First Boston Corp. to advise it on a possible restructuring, which sources said 
might involve a sale of the company or of its junk bond portfolio. The company, 
however, hasn't announced any specific plans.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSICRIO'S NOT EVEN SINGING 'HOW DRY I AM' ANYMORE 
</P>

The Rio's story is finally over. The Loma Portal nightclub, which for the last 
three years has been one of the few places in town to regularly showcase local 
bands that play original music, shut its doors for good Sept. 21 after a 
protracted and bitter battle with the state Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of clubs in San Diego that feature original 
music, so the closing of Rio's is particularly hard to take," bassist Michael 
Davis said. His former band, Secret Society, played Rio's at least once a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I wonder if the ABC has it out for the clubs in this town," said 
Steve Saint, singer-songwriter with Club of Rome and the editor of San Diego 
Music magazine. "It seems a lot of clubs are having trouble with either their 
noise limits or alcohol or some other technicality. And is it my imagination, 
or do they tend to pick the original-music clubs to hassle?" 
</P>
<P>
The closure of the 400-capacity nightclub came less than four months after the 
ABC effectively revoked club owner Cameron Moshtaghi's liquor license because 
Rio's wasn't doing enough food business to meet the Type 47 license 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Rio's has been operating as a booze-less 18-and-over club, but the 
resultant dip in revenues eventually proved too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
"All summer long, we tried very hard to go without alcohol," Moshtaghi said, 
"but we just can't make it with soft drinks alone any longer." 
</P>
<P>
The battle lines were first drawn in 1987 when Moshtaghi bought the former 
Halcyon, a combination restaurant/Top 40 nightclub, and acquired a Type 47 
liquor license from the old owner. 
</P>
<P>
After an extensive remodel, in which kitchen operations were reduced and some 
restaurant space was merged into the nightclub area, Rio's was born. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC issued a series of warnings to Moshtaghi that he wasn't complying with 
the license, said Pete Case, district administrator of the ABC's San Diego 
office. In June, 1988, the ABC found Moshtaghi in violation of his license, 
fined him $800 and ordered him to operate what Case terms "a bona fide public 
eating place," just like the Halcyon had been. 
</P>
<P>
Moshtaghi subsequently reopened the kitchen and hired a full-time cook. "But 
then nobody wanted to eat," he said. "We kept throwing out all that food, but 
because of the stupid ABC rule, we had to have it." 
</P>
<P>
That fall, Moshtaghi was found in violation a second time. "This time, my 
attorney said they're wrong and we're going to fight it," he said. "We had 
everything they told us to have -- food, a cook on duty -- and if the people 
weren't eating, it wasn't our fault." 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes it was, Case maintains. "How could he expect people to eat with all that 
din?" Case said. "He's supposed to be primarily a restaurant, not a hard-rock 
club. And if you look at that thing he's running, it's a far cry from a 
restaurant. No wonder people wouldn't eat." 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing fight between Moshtaghi and the ABC involved various hearings and 
lasted nearly two years. Finally, on June 7, the ABC suspended Moshtaghi's 
liquor license for an indefinite period. He could no longer sell booze until he 
exchanged his Type 47 license for a Type 48, which doesn't require serving 
food. 
</P>
<P>
Moshtaghi did as he was told. But what he hoped would be a quick transfer was 
delayed due to protests from police and residents of a neighboring apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point we called the ABC and said, 'You guys dictated to us we had to 
change, but now this thing is dragging on and on and we're having trouble 
surviving,' " Moshtaghi said. "So we asked to get our Type 47 license back, and 
they said no; then we asked for help in getting a Type 48, and they said well, 
you've got problems; you have a right to a public hearing, but that may take 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
In late July, after operating Rio's, in the red, for nearly two dry months, 
Moshtaghi -- or, rather, the corporation he set up to run the place, Javad Inc. 
-- filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal 
Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't afford to pay the rent," Moshtaghi said, "and that would hold 
everyone off." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rio's hours of operations were cut back from seven nights a 
week to as few as two or three. 
</P>
<P>
Then it became a question of how long Moshtaghi could hold out. The answer came 
Sept. 20, when trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court forced Javad Inc. into 
Chapter 7, which is a complete dissolution. The next night was Rio's last. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I'm pretty much out of it," Moshtaghi said. "The trustee told 
me to shut it down, and I did." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Moshtaghi said, he's hoping to open a new nightclub somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a new location where I can do local showcases and have some 
national acts, just like Rio's, but it isn't easy," he said. "But I'm going to 
pursue it until I do. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been getting so many phone calls from all these local bands, asking me, 
'where are we going to play now that Rio's is gone?' " 
</P>
<P>
"From a musician's standpoint, I'm really sorry to see it go, mainly because I 
don't see anything else popping up to replace it in the near future," Secret 
Society's Davis said. "We're really lacking places that size to play." 
</P>
<P>
"If club owners depend on alcohol to stay in business," added Saint, "maybe it 
would be nice to see a new paradigm emerge where clubs can find another way to 
stay in business and still showcase music." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Linda Ronstadt must have graduated from the Sean Penn school of 
charm. At her concert Sunday night at San Diego State University's Open Air 
Theater, the fortysomething singer went into a snit when some fan aimed a 
camera at her. Stop flashing that camera, she snapped, or a security guard 
might come and take it away from you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Honk, the eclectic Orange County rock band of "Five Summer Stories" fame, will 
headline Sunday night's Surfrider Foundation benefit at the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach. Also appearing at the fund-raiser for the nonprofit coastal 
environmental group will be local oldies band the Mar Dels. A dozen surfboard 
companies -- including Hobie, Nectar and Shannin -- have each donated a custom 
surfboard to be auctioned off. Honk broke up in 1976 and then got back together 
in 1985; ever since, they've been doing a handful of reunion concerts each 
year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Thursday at 3 p.m. for Jane's Addiction's concert Nov. 2 at 
UC San Diego Price Center Ballroom. It's the first date on the band's U.S. 
tour. UCSD students can buy tickets as early as 10 a.m., but only at the campus 
box office (IDs required). . . . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Allen's scheduled Oct. 17 appearance at Humphrey's has been canceled. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: John McLaughlin with Steve Morse, 
Thursday at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Robben Ford with Lowen and Navarro, 
Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern; the U.K. Subs with Gorgeous George, Saturday 
at the Spirit in Bay Park; Carlene Carter, Sunday at the Bacchanal; and Andrew

INQUIRY INTO LAPD MAY JEOPARDIZE DRUG CASES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE D.A.'S OFFICE SAYS OFFICERS MAY HAVE STOLEN MONEY. NONE 
HAVE BEEN INDICTED.

In a move that could jeopardize as many as 30 criminal cases, the district 
attorney's office is alerting drug defendants arrested by Los Angeles Police 
Department narcotics officers that several officers are themselves being 
investigated "for the theft of confiscated drug monies and other crimes." 
</P>
<P>
At least five Police Department officers are being investigated as part of a 
widening probe of alleged money-skimming by sheriff's narcotics deputies, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, the chief prosecution witness against 
numerous county sheriff's deputies, also has accused LAPD officers of beating 
drug suspects, stealing money and pocketing illegal drugs, according to FBI 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The joint federal-local investigation in the past has focused on alleged 
criminal wrongdoing in the 8,000-member Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. The revelations rocked the Sheriff's Department, where 10 narcotics 
officers were indicted and another 16 suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The probe widened to include allegations that at least five LAPD narcotics 
officers may have engaged in similar conduct, and now some LAPD administrators 
are worried that their agency's reputation could be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys at Parker Center are running scared; they saw what happened with 
the sheriff's deputies," said one LAPD supervisor who has been briefed on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Hernandez, an attorney for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, 
pointed out Tuesday that none of the police officers have been indicted or 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
He said that several officers were placed on administrative duties, their 
personal finances were reviewed, and the home of one officer was searched 
although the officers volunteered to cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"People suspect that perhaps they are corrupt, when there has not been any 
factual information that that is true," Hernandez said. "I mean, here we are a 
year into this thing and there have been no indictments. 
</P>
<P>
"And today they are devastated and demoralized. These are good, hard-working 
and experienced officers whose reputations have been tarnished." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, he said, is that the criminal cases they put together 
against various Los Angeles drug dealers are being jeopardized solely because 
the officers are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"These are mid-level to major violators," he said of the drug defendants 
arrested by the LAPD narcotics officers. "These are distribution and sale 
cases. These defendants are not the nickel-and-dime street dealers who are 
passing around rock cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
In September, prosecutors began sending notification letters to attorneys for 
the drug defendants. The notices state: 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this letter is to inform you that Los Angeles Police Department 
Officer . . . , who may be a witness on this case, is being investigated by the 
Los Angeles Police Department, the Sheriff's Department and federal agencies 
for the theft of confiscated drug monies and other crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Some sources within the LAPD said that the five officers may have as many as 30 
cases among them. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis A. Hazell, acting head of the district attorney's major narcotics and 
forfeiture division, confirmed Tuesday that the letters were sent as a 
"precautionary measure" in an undetermined number of pending cases and in nine 
closed cases. 
</P>
<P>
"On those (closed) cases, there are specific allegations of misconduct 
involving police officer activities, evidence or testimony which call into 
question the validity of the convictions," Hazell said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that even more letters may be sent. "It's an ongoing investigation," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what impact the investigation may have on drug cases is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
In the sheriff's cases, Hazell said about 20 criminal cases involving sheriff's 
deputies have been affected by the money-skimming scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, the prosecution's chief witness, has pleaded guilty to stealing $1.4 
million in seized money. He previously worked as the supervisor of the joint 
Sheriff's-LAPD Southwest Task Force that targeted mid-level street dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last year that the task force was originally known as the 
Freeway Rick Task Force because it was formed in January, 1987, to build a case 
against alleged South-Central Los Angeles cocaine boss Ricky Donnell Ross, 
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
That special unit -- initially four sheriff's deputies and four LAPD officers 
directed by Sobel -- had been accused by several witnesses of theft and 
brutality during investigations of Ross and other suspected cocaine 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking charges against Ross were dismissed in mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of meetings with the FBI over the last year, Sobel outlined a 
variety of allegations that not only touched on sheriff's deputies, but 
broadened with details about criminal activity by LAPD narcotics officers. A 
partial summary states: 
</P>
<P>
* A Ladera Heights bust resulted in a situation where "a bag of money was 
recovered and everybody had his hands in it," the summary said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sobel basically had to wrestle it away from them," the summary added. "Then 
(one LAPD officer) transported the money back to the station and only (that 
officer) and Sobel got any, because (the LAPD officer) told him to take some as 
a going away present." 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine was taken illegally from the trunk of a car and planted in a house near 
Chadron Street in Hawthorne in February, 1987, with the complicity of four LAPD 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sobel did see (an LAPD officer) remove the cocaine from the Chevy at Chadron 
and devise the plan of planting it at the other location," the summary said. 
"There is no question that each member of the task force knew that dope was 
moved and planted in this manner." 
</P>
<P>
The summary also said about this episode: "Sobel advised that he knew (an LAPD 
officer) played the game and that (the officer) stole when he was at LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
Intent on busting Ross, LAPD officers kept up a running joke about how they 
were going to plant illegal narcotics on the drug suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"As time went on," the summary said, "it became common knowledge among the 
entire task force that (an LAPD officer) was carrying around a kilo of dope in 
the tire well of his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"(The LAPD officer) would be bragging about a present for Ricky Ross when they 
ran into him. There were constant jokes made about the dope they had ready for 
Ricky Ross when they found him." 
</P>
<P>
A drug suspect allegedly was beaten while other officers stood by without 
interfering. The officers were apparently upset with the suspect because one 
officer had injured his thumb in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"You could start to hear quite a bit of screaming after they went inside," the 
summary said, quoting Sobel.

TAX HIKES TO HIT THE POOR, MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite earlier vows to the contrary by both Democrats and Republicans, the tax 
increases and benefit cuts in the sweeping $500-billion federal budget plan 
will hit poor and middle-class Americans harder than the rich, new figures 
released Tuesday show. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deficit-reduction agreement between the White House and congressional 
leaders, the poorest Americans would suffer a 2% loss of income and the most 
affluent 10% would have to accept only a 0.7% reduction, according to an 
analysis by the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
For example, taxpayers with average after-tax incomes of roughly $26,000 would 
be hit with an average of $338 in additional taxes and higher benefit costs, 
the committee calculated. That translates to an average 1.3% cut in income. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan package, which would increase taxes by $134 billion and curb 
social benefits by $119 billion over five years, has come under attack by 
critics who contend that it places the greatest burden of deficit reduction on 
those with the least ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal continues the unfairness and inefficiency of the policies of the 
last decade," complained New York's Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who opposes 
the package. "For every $1 of progressive taxes on the wealthy, it raises $3 of 
regressive taxes on the middle class." 
</P>
<P>
The Ways and Means Committee analysis of the effect of the budget package is 
based on the overall impact on families and assumes that the tax changes 
continue through the full five years of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who labored on the package for more than four months explained the 
result as the unfortunate but inevitable outcome of a last-minute compromise in 
which the White House dropped its insistence on a capital gains tax cut that 
would have largely benefited the wealthy, and Democrats agreed to abandon their 
effort to increase income tax rates on those earning more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the package, outside of defense spending cuts, relies largely on 
boosts in Medicare premiums and increases in consumption taxes on such items as 
gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest impact would come from higher energy taxes. The federal gasoline 
tax, currently 9 cents a gallon, would rise to 21 cents by the middle of 1991. 
Beer, wine and distilled spirits would be hit by sharply higher taxes, and the 
cigarette tax would be increased by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some increase in regressivity due to the Republican insistence 
on higher gasoline taxes," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser 
(D-Tenn.) said on Sunday when the agreement was announced. "That will be the 
single biggest problem in securing Democratic support." 
</P>
<P>
However, several Democratic lawmakers, such as Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Leon E. Panetta 
(D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee, long have advocated 
higher gasoline taxes to help reduce the deficit and discourage energy waste. 
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Democrats aimed most of their fire at Bush's proposed capital 
gains tax cut, counting on higher income taxes on the wealthy to offset any 
advantage for upper-income groups. When the White House dropped the tax cut 
plan, Democrats were in no position to argue that income tax rates should be 
boosted anyway to offset the disproportionate burden of consumption taxes on 
lower-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials defended their decision to resist any explicit increase 
in income tax rates for the wealthy as part of a strategy to keep rates low for 
all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The top rate, in fact, the rates of all American taxpayers were kept at what 
they were before the negotiations," said White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu. "Even though folks may argue that they only want to increase the top 
rates, it is like grabbing somebody . . . by the hair. Once you lift the top, 
the rest follows rather quickly." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent upper-income groups from escaping nearly all the pain of deficit 
reduction, budget negotiators decided to impose a 10% tax on luxury items and a 
limit on itemized deductions for those with incomes above $100,000. In 
addition, they boosted payroll taxes for those with incomes above $51,300. 
</P>
<P>
The itemized deduction limit, which shaves deductions by $300 for each $10,000 
in income above $100,000, has the same effect as increasing tax rates by about 
1 percentage point for those affected. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly regressive character of the final budget package runs against the 
position taken by Democrats throughout the talks that wealthy Americans should 
carry more of the burden of financing the federal government. Republicans, 
meanwhile, agreed that the package should do nothing to make the distribution 
of income worse. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a balance," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said in 
mid-September. "We have to have progressivity, and I think we're going to have 
it." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Dole was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW TAX BITE 
</P>
<P>
Here is how tax and benefit changes contained in the new White 
House-congressional budget accord would affect Americans in various income 
groups.

IT CELEBRATES ITS FIFTH BIRTHDAY AS THE LARGEST IN NORTH AMERICA. BUT OFFICIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
By all rights, it should be a phenomenal success story -- a business that has 
grown from nothing to $10.6 billion in sales in five years, created 3,000 jobs 
and given schools $4 billion to boot. 
</P>
<P>
But as the California Lottery modestly celebrates its fifth birthday this week, 
it is getting as much criticism as it is accolades. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues on its major games -- Lotto, Decco and Scratchers -- are flat. Many of 
its hard-core players are angry about a change in the Lotto game that 
dramatically heightened the odds of losing. A public-interest group is starting 
a campaign against its advertising, labeling it "misleading and deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
Most troublesome of all, today, the day the lottery commemorates its first 
ticket sales in 1985, a state Senate committee is convening to question lottery 
officials about some of their business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials, who see the creation of a multibillion-dollar business in 
five years as nothing short of "incredible," seem mystified by the sudden 
onslaught of criticism. They concede that they may have miscalculated some 
players' reaction to the change in the Lotto odds, but they say the lottery -- 
like everything else -- has been the victim of economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Disneyland mismanaged because the oil crisis is resulting in their tourism 
being down?" asked Chon Gutierrez, the ebullient director of California's 
lottery. "Is government mismanaged because there is a recession and revenues 
are down and the budget is tight?" 
</P>
<P>
Even in good economic times, he said, the lottery is a roller coaster business. 
Revenues soar when jackpots, new games and new twists in old games spark 
players' interest and slide when the novelty wears off. Whenever there is a dip 
in enthusiasm, he said, lottery management adjusts the games to reignite player 
interest, but often it takes time to reach a new high. 
</P>
<P>
Players are seeing a typical slide, he said, that is exacerbated by economic 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
I. Nelson Rose, a Whittier College law professor and expert on gambling law, 
agreed. He said it is common for lotteries to come under intense criticism 
after about five years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, this is a consumer item and it is a very poor consumer item," he 
said. "The chances of winning a significant prize are so small that people are 
literally being frustrated every day of their lives. What they're doing is 
airing that frustration. The state lottery isn't doing anything it shouldn't be 
doing. The problem is people are spending a lot of money on the lottery and 
losing." 
</P>
<P>
Even the criticism cannot overshadow the fact that the lottery celebrates its 
fifth birthday firmly entrenched in the California lifestyle. From an operation 
that began with four secretaries and three executives in March, 1985, it has 
become the biggest lottery in North America and the fifth largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, 90% of California adults have played the lottery at least once, 
according to state lottery figures. On its busiest days, it logs more 
transactions than the New York Stock Exchange. In five years it has made 577 
people millionaires and distributed about $5.2 billion in prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Who plays the lottery is a question that has been debated over its five-year 
lifetime. Critics claim it preys on the poor by capitalizing on dreams of a 
better life. Lottery officials say they try to attract urban professionals and 
the well-to-do. Independent polls by the Los Angeles Times in 1986 and 1987 
showed the lottery was most popular with individuals who earn from $10,000 to 
$40,000 annually, with blue-collar workers and with men. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm for the lottery in California began before the first ticket was 
sold. On Nov. 6, 1984, voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative 
establishing California as a lottery state despite a vigorous opposing campaign 
from church groups and parimutuel gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, the political consultant who ran the campaign to try to defeat the 
lottery, said once the issue was settled at the polls, active opposition seemed 
to cease. "The people who didn't like it didn't have to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Its early success helped lottery fever spread to other states. In 1984, 
California was the 21st state to approve a lottery. Today, 30 states and the 
District of Columbia have lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its popularity and general public acceptance, there are some public 
officials who acknowledge an uneasiness. Although at least 34% of lottery 
revenues must be dedicated to public education, there is a widespread feeling 
even among the original promoters of the lottery that it has not been that good 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
So much emphasis in the original promotion of the lottery was given to the 
benefits for education, they said, that in many voters' minds it became a 
solution to education's money problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People thought all of a sudden it would be this cornucopia of endless funds 
for education. It was an unrealistic expectation," said Rose. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, bond issues and other efforts to raise money for education 
were defeated in part because voters believed the lottery had already taken 
care of education, critics and supporters agree. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Fadem, a San Francisco lawyer who sponsored and helped author the 
initiative for Scientific Games in 1984, said the lottery's promoters put so 
much emphasis on the billions of dollars that the games of chance would raise 
for education that voters never understood those billions only represented 3% 
of education's total budget. 
</P>
<P>
"My only regret is that a lot of California voters carried the impression that 
the lottery would solve all of California's education funding woes," said 
Fadem. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said he originally opposed the lottery 
initiative, believing that it would never be the "icing on the cake" for 
education that its promoters promised. He said he suspected -- and experience 
in the initial years has proved him right -- that the money given to education 
by the lottery would encourage the governor and Legislature to provide less 
from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, who has no criticism of the way the lottery is being run, talks, as do 
many public officials, of being troubled by the fact that a state-run gambling 
operation is used to finance the education of California's young people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly appreciative of the money but I'm just uncomfortable 
encouraging people to gamble," he said. "There's a philosophical problem. Here 
we're trying to tell kids work hard, study hard, make the long, slow effort to 
learn and it will pay off. And then we have advertising on television that says 
play the lottery and lightning will strike." 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis, whose office regularly audits the lottery, said, "If I 
had to grade the lottery I'd give it a B. It has fulfilled its mission to 
provide an additional 3% funding to schools. . . . On the other hand, I feel 
badly that revenue for important public services such as education have to be 
generated by gambling." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Carl Oshiro, supervising attorney for the University of San 
Diego's Center for Public Interest Law, has filed a complaint with lottery 
officials contending that its television advertising is misleading because it 
fails to disclose the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have the state of California teaching folks through its advertising 
that gambling ought to be part of their daily life, part of their daily routine 
and spending massive amounts of money to do it," Oshiro said. "It didn't seem 
to us that there was any money spent on putting out any other message either in 
terms of what the product really is or perhaps warning people of the 
consequences of excessive gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said it would be difficult to disclose the odds in a 30-second 
television spot. He said the agency is considering some type of advertising 
campaign to warn against excessive gambling. He said that under his direction 
the lottery has been careful never to use children in advertising or promote 
its link to education as reason people should gamble. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery has been one of the top advertisers in the state -- last year it 
spent $63.9 million on advertising and promotion -- since it opened its doors 
in 1985 with a game called Scratchers, which allowed the player to scratch off 
the surface of each $1 ticket to determine if it was a winner. A year later, it 
was advertising another game, Lotto, which was to become its most popular 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, players selected six numbers from a field of 49 and the winning 
combinations were picked during televised Saturday night drawings. Now, players 
pick from a field of 53 and drawings are held Wednesdays and Saturdays. The 
lottery has recently added Decco, a game using card symbols, and Topper, an 
add-on to the Lotto game that utilizes the names of California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Topper, the results for all games in recent months have been 
disappointing. Decco has not produced the revenue that Lottery officials 
anticipated. Scratchers has been in a steady decline and Lotto revenues have 
not surged to their heights of a year ago. At the end of the 1989-90 fiscal 
year, the lottery reported that its total sales revenues would be $100 million 
less than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to produce more super-jackpots, officials in June expanded 
the field of numbers from which Lotto players can pick. Instead of choosing 
from 49 numbers, players are allowed to choose from 53. The idea was that by 
increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 23 million, fewer jackpots 
would be won and there would be more roll-overs. An accumulation of roll-overs 
produces the super-jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
Since the change, however, there has been no string of super-jackpots and 
revenue has not increased appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Love, editor of The Lotto Edge, a Los Angeles-based newsletter that 
caters to regular players, said the change in odds caused the backbone of the 
lottery's business -- the hard-core player -- to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened is exactly what the regular players told them would happen a 
year ago. The consensus among us was we would either stop playing or play less 
(if the odds were changed)," he said. "Many of my readers did exactly that. 
People who were playing $40 and $50 a game or even $100 a game now play $5 or 
$10." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Organization Committee that oversees the lottery, has asked lottery officials 
to be prepared to defend the change and explain at his hearing today how they 
expected to increase sales by reducing a player's chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said the increase in sales would have come naturally if the change to 
53 numbers had produced a number of super-jackpots. But the lottery has been 
faced with the same thing that many gamblers face -- bad luck. Since the 
change, there has been one $44-million jackpot, and that unfortunately occurred 
at the same time Florida had a $106-million jackpot. The California jackpot, 
which in other times would have attracted major publicity, looked like small 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Gutierrez said he could never have foreseen the crisis in the 
Middle East, which sent gasoline prices soaring, pushing the economy into a 
slump and leaving consumers with less expendable cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we anticipated perhaps the things that are driving the economy to be a 
little bit soft like the gulf crisis, had all of this been in our crystal ball, 
then obviously we would have made the (change) a year ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said it is still early to determine whether the Lotto change is a 
success or failure. He said the lottery is taking the criticism from the 
players seriously and is planning a new game in a few weeks -- possibly a Lotto 
game with a number field of 39 -- which will offer top prizes of about $1 
million and better odds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts disagree on the long-term significance of the criticism. 
Fadem believes it will quickly fade; Rose agrees but suggests that overall 
doubts about the lottery may linger. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view this as a long-term problem," said Fadem. "It (player interest) 
moves in cycles. Looking back over the last five years, I think they've done a 
helluva job and I think in general Californians are satisfied with the games 
that are available." 
</P>
<P>
Rose observed that lotteries, like their games, go through cycles. In 
post-Colonial days of the 1820s and 1830s, it was "easier to buy a lottery 
ticket than it is today." By the Civil War, they had nearly disappeared. After 
the war, the economic devastation in the South sparked a revival. Then, by the 
turn of the century, there were no legal lotteries in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We go through these great swings from permissiveness to prohibition," Rose 
said. "We're definitely on the upswing of a permissive era now, but the 
question is, 'Will it last?' I am sure after the Civil War it was inconceivable 
that they would ever be outlawed, but (several decades later) they were."

SOUTER CONFIRMED FOR HIGH COURT IN 90-9 VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: SENATE OPPONENTS SAID THEY FEARED HE WOULD BACK OVERTURNING OF ROE 
VS. WADE RULING.

<P>
Opposed only by nine liberal senators, federal Judge David H. Souter was 
confirmed Tuesday to a lifetime appointment as the nation's 105th justice of 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, all Democrats, said that they feared Souter would vote to 
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling affirming the right to 
abortion. But the New Hampshire jurist won the praise of most senators before 
the 90 to 9 vote as a thoughtful and learned student of the law -- although one 
whose views on the abortion issue remain unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a most impressive man. He is going to make us all proud," said Sen. Alan 
K. Simpson (R-Wyo.). 
</P>
<P>
The no votes were cast by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii), Brock Adams (D-Wash.), Bill Bradley 
(D-N.J.), Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Quentin N. Burdick (D-N.D.), John Kerry 
(D-Mass.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.). 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's first nominee to the high court will be sworn in next Tuesday, 
in time to hear a key sex discrimination case: On Wednesday, the justices will 
hear arguments on whether a company can exclude all young women from its work 
force if job conditions could harm a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
But that case will be only the first of many tests for Souter. Senators noted 
Tuesday that if his health remains good, the 51-year-old jurist is likely to 
remain seated on the court well into the second decade of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
He will join a court already dominated by five conservatives, including all of 
its youngest members. If Souter proves to be a doctrinaire conservative, the 
court under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist could dramatically reshape the 
law on abortion, civil rights, religion and free speech. 
</P>
<P>
But Souter's generally moderate testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
last month raised the possibility that he could turn out to be a centrist 
justice, one who is unwilling to push the law to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Most senators conceded that they have no idea how Souter will vote on the most 
controversial issues before the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The Senate is still in the dark about this nomination," Kennedy said. "The 
lesson of the past decade . . . is that we must vote our fears, not our hopes." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), who attended Harvard University with 
Souter but did not know him, said that mutual friends convinced him to support 
the nominee. Reporting on a series of conversations, Wirth said that Souter was 
portrayed as "bright, thoughtful and idealistic . . . not partisan, not 
extremist and not an ideologue. This is a profile of someone I can trust." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said that he was inclined to vote against Souter based 
on his record as a state attorney and judge in New Hampshire but changed his 
view after hearing him testify last month. "His testimony before our committee 
either shows growth . . . or it shows political dexterity," Simon said, adding 
that he was convinced Souter would vote to uphold Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Other Democrats said that Souter's unwillingness to state support for the right 
to abortion was cause for voting no. "He has demanded (that) we take him on 
faith in this critical area of constitutional rights. That I cannot do," 
Cranston said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) was the only member of the Senate to miss the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Souter watched the vote on television in the Concord, N.H., law office of Tom 
Rath, a close friend from their days in the attorney general's office. Later at 
a news conference at the state Capitol, Souter told reporters: "I have been 
given much, and much will be expected from me in return. I will make that 
return to you and I will make it in the fullest measure that I can." 
</P>
<P>
During the four-hour Senate debate, Souter's patron, Sen. Warren B. Rudman 
(R-N.H.), stood beaming on the Senate floor and took congratulatory handshakes 
from dozens of his colleagues. A well-liked member of the Senate, Rudman pushed 
Souter's name before President Bush and then rounded up support among his 
colleagues for a man he called "one of my dearest friends." 
</P>
<P>
Several senators commented that Rudman's backing was a "major factor" in 
prompting them to support Souter. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the President was "very 
pleased" with the confirmation vote. "We think Judge Souter will be an 
outstanding justice for many years," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
For President Bush, the Souter nomination has proved to be a political triumph. 
On July 20, when the court's aging liberal leader William J. Brennan Jr. 
suddenly announced his retirement, Bush faced the possibility of a bitter 
partisan fight on the volatile issue of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the White House moved quickly to select a judge whose views, as one 
aide said, were "fuzzed up." As a state court judge, Souter had not decided an 
abortion case. Nor had he written law articles or given speeches touching on 
the topic. 
</P>
<P>
During his Senate testimony, Souter said that he believes the Constitution 
includes a "right to privacy" but noted that he had not made up his mind on 
whether this includes the right to choose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Only women's rights groups, such as the National Organization for Women, the 
Planned Parenthood Federation and the National Abortion Rights Action League, 
strongly opposed Souter's nomination.

APPEALS COURT DELAYS RULING ON FUNDING LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: JUDGES SAY THEY'LL DECIDE LATER WHETHER TO OVERTURN A RULING BLOCKING 
PROPOSITION 73'S CAMPAIGN RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
Keeping the door open for statewide candidates to collect huge campaign 
donations, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals balked Tuesday at immediately 
reinstating Proposition 73's political contribution limits for the Nov. 6 
election. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing arguments on the issue for more than two hours, the three-judge 
panel said it would take the case under submission and announce later whether 
it will block a lower court decision overturning the contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
So for the moment, candidates for statewide and local elections can continue 
raising campaign funds without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court was asked by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, 
two authors of Proposition 73 and the California Republican Party to stay the 
lower court's decision last week that overturned key provisions of the 1988 
initiative. Democratic legislative leaders, labor unions and the Democratic 
Party, which won the initial ruling, argued against any move to reinstate the 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision that touched off a flurry of fund raising, U.S. District Judge 
Lawrence K. Karlton ruled that the contribution limits of Proposition 73 were 
unconstitutional because they hampered the ability of challengers to raise 
campaign funds. Siding with Democratic legislative leaders and labor unions, 
the judge also threw out Proposition 73's ban on transferring money among 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But a few days later, Karlton reinstated the campaign contribution limits of 
Proposition 73 for legislative races. Again agreeing with Democrats, Karlton 
concluded that the limits in the proposition would be less onerous than the 
restrictions of Proposition 68, a rival measure that would take effect in the 
absence of Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
While the three appeals court judges did not disclose how they will rule, their 
questioning of the attorneys in the case indicated that two of the three have 
serious reservations about overruling Karlton in the complex matter. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Parrinello, an attorney for the Republican Party, argued that the 
sudden change in the law six weeks before the election posed a hardship to many 
candidates who had planned their campaigns months in advance. "The rules were 
changed with two minutes left in the fourth quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge William A. Norris shot back, "Have you ever known of a candidate who 
wasn't willing to adapt his campaign to take advantage of new money?" 
</P>
<P>
Judge Cecil S. Poole also seemed unwilling to grant a stay, suggesting that the 
increase in campaign funds "is not going to subvert the election process." 
</P>
<P>
However, Judge Charles E. Wiggins, a former Republican congressman from 
Fullerton, questioned Democratic attorneys closely about whether Proposition 73 
was in fact unfair to challengers, as Karlton ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wiggins took issue with the legal theory that campaign contribution 
limits generally are constitutional because they counter corruption or the 
appearance of corruption among public officials. "Nobody is accusing anybody of 
being corrupt," he said. "It is the ill-conceived perception of corruption 
(among public officials) that some people in our society harbor." 
</P>
<P>
Since Karlton's decision, some candidates have taken advantage of the ruling to 
raise large donations, including Democratic gubernatorial nominee Dianne 
Feinstein, who has raised at least several hundred thousand dollars from labor 
unions and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson said that if the court fails to 
reinstate Proposition 73's voter-approved restrictions, he would renew his 
challenge to Feinstein to abide by the $1,000 limit on individual contributions 
established by the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"And if she can't do that, I would invite her to at least abide by some limit," 
Wilson told reporters after he addressed the convention of the California Assn. 
of Realtors.

STINGING DMV RENEWAL BILLS TRACED TO A BUG IN COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Dixon Gayer's wife bought him his $40,000 Lexus sedan last year, she told 
him he should feel like royalty. But when he got his first renewal bill from 
the Department of Motor Vehicles for $1,710 this week, he said he felt more 
like a pauper. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the bill and knew there had to be some sort of mistake. I was 
definitely not counting on paying that much," said the retired Cal State Long 
Beach journalism professor from his Huntington Beach home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gayer was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Because a Sacramento computer operator incorrectly programmed a new fee 
schedule, the DMV has made its most widespread billing snafu in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
DMV officials said that about 330,000 Californians were mailed erroneous bills 
during the last week, some of which reflected renewal charges of up to $2,500 
for Volkswagen bugs, Ford Pintos and other modest means of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The fees are determined by a formula that is based on a car's value. 
</P>
<P>
Gayer's bill should have been $658 for the Lexus. A couple in Westminster were 
billed $2,089 to register a 10-year-old car for which the fee should have been 
$54. 
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be no rhyme or reason for the way people were charged," Dale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had (computer and billing) problems before," DMV spokesman Bill Gengler 
said. "but nothing of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
But if you've received a registration renewal bill that literally takes your 
breath away, DMV officials said, not to worry. The computer system is fixed and 
car owners with bollixed bills will get corrected ones soon. 
</P>
<P>
The problem occurred Sept. 24 when a computer operator was attempting to revise 
the fee schedule for the five 1920 Rolls-Royces registered in California. In 
the process, he accidently changed the programming for all cars with renewal 
dates of Nov. 16, 18 and 20. As a result, bills to 421,000 people throughout 
the state were printed out wrong, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
About 91,000 were caught before they were mailed out when the DMV discovered 
the mistake Friday. But about 330,000 were mailed out before the error was 
caught, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Of those mailed out, about 41,000 were too high, Gengler said. The remainder of 
the bills undercharged for registration renewals. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have already paid will get a refund or will be billed for the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said that those with erroneous bills should not contact their DMV 
branch office but should wait for the corrected bill to arrive in the mail.

A pro-Iraqi group in the former French colony of Djibouti claimed 
responsibility for a grenade attack last week against a cafe popular with 
French troops in which a boy died and 17 people were injured, officials said. A 
leaflet from the previously unknown group, the Movement for Djibouti Youth, was 
found in a taxi used in the attack on the crowded Cafe de Paris in the bustling 
port. Foreign Minister Roland Dumas had warned that France would retaliate if 
Iraq was linked to the incident.

A KGB general dismissed for his fierce public criticism and revelations about 
the security service launched a lawsuit against his former bosses, saying they 
had no right to strip him of his pension. Oleg Kalugin, 55, named KGB chief 
Vladimir Kryuchkov and two other top officials in his action, calling the 
denial of the pension an "inhuman act" taken as a reprisal. Moscow city court 
adjourned the case until Oct. 23, pending information from the Moscow 
prosecutor on KGB charges that Kalugin revealed state secrets by disclosing 
details of the security service's operations in the United States.

ZULU CHIEF REJECTS BID TO MEET WITH MANDELA 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi on Tuesday declined an invitation from 
the African National Congress to join homeland leaders in meeting Nelson 
Mandela to discuss ways of ending the recent surge of black factional fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise decision dampened hopes of an early reconciliation between South 
Africa's two main black rivals, Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and Mandela's 
ANC. Much of the recent fighting, which has claimed 760 lives since Aug. 13, 
has been between supporters of Inkatha and the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the two leaders and a political settlement between their 
parties is viewed as an important step toward ending further bloodshed in 
Johannesburg-area townships as well as in Inkatha's home base of Natal 
province. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, who is chief minister of the Kwazulu homeland as well as head of 
Inkatha, had been invited along with other leaders of self-governing black 
homelands to meet Mandela at his Soweto home this Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Zulu chief has issued more than 50 public requests to meet Mandela since 
the ANC leader's release from prison in February. But Buthelezi had in mind a 
one-on-one meeting, something the ANC has refused to arrange because of 
widespread animosity toward the Zulu chief among its members. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi told reporters in Geneva, where he is attending an economic 
conference, that he declined the invitation because "it's not the kind of 
meeting that can contribute to defusing the violence. The meeting must be 
between leaders whose followers are involved in the violence." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ANC expressed its "sincere regret" that Buthelezi had 
decided not to attend. However, the ANC said it would do everything possible to 
ensure that efforts to end the violence continue. It added that it would 
maintain a dialogue recently initiated between other ANC and Inkatha leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Three years of internecine warfare in Natal between Zulu supporters of Inkatha 
and Zulu supporters of the ANC has claimed nearly 4,000 lives.

<P>
Buthelezi had previously expressed reservations about attending the meeting 
because he had been invited in his capacity as a homeland leader, rather than 
as head of the 1.8-million-member Inkatha Party. 
</P>
<P>
The invitation to leaders of the five other black homelands, which are not 
directly involved in the recent fighting, was an indication that the meeting 
was not intended to seriously discuss ways of ending the violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi broke with the ANC in the mid-1970s. Although he consistently 
pressured the government to release Mandela, Buthelezi angered many ANC members 
by agreeing to participate in the government's homeland system and then 
campaigning internationally against the ANC's support for economic sanctions 
and guerrilla war.

Maybe it was the woman down the street with that snarly dog, Rufus. Or perhaps 
it was that television anchorman in Tacoma, maybe it was his doing. Or maybe it 
was everyone's good friend Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, something can explain one of America's more dumbfounding electoral 
upsets. 
</P>
<P>
All over the state of Washington, people are trying to figure it out -- just 
how did it come to pass that respected state Supreme Court Chief Justice Keith 
Callow lost his reelection bid to a publicly unknown and self-described 
"blue-collar attorney" named Charles W. Johnson who did not even mount a 
campaign? 
</P>
<P>
This upset, called the Fluke of the Decade by the newspapers here, occurred on 
Sept. 18 in a low-turnout statewide election. It has brought on a wave of 
self-examination in the state of Washington, calling into question the ability 
of voters to cast an informed judgment on their judges and undermining 
Washington's confidence in its electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
The facts on which most agree are these: 
</P>
<P>
Callow, 65, has been an esteemed jurist who avoided political hot water during 
six years on the nine-member high court. Johnson, 39, a lawyer in solo practice 
who handles minor criminal cases and divorces, filed for the seat on the ground 
that judges "need to be challenged." 
</P>
<P>
And that's pretty much where it rested. Neither man mounted a traditional 
campaign. The news media gave the contest barely a glance. 
</P>
<P>
On Election Day, voters went to the polls without benefit of a voter pamphlet. 
Washington does not issue one in primary elections. As usual, judges on the 
ballot were not identified by incumbency, job title or political party. Just 
one name next to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The result: 53% to 47% for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, there are a lot more Johnsons out there than Callows," the ousted chief 
justice remarked later. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion over names has emerged as the No. 1 theory to explain the election. 
With no campaign to help them and no ballot pamphlet to identify the 
candidates, did voters just pick a name that seemed most familiar and 
comfortable? 
</P>
<P>
"Who doesn't have a friend named Charlie Johnson?" shrugged Secretary of State 
Ralph Munro. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer counted 27 in Seattle alone. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Charles V. Johnson is a veteran King County Superior Court 
judge. And then there is Charles Johnson, the Tacoma television anchorman, 
whose broadcasts are seen statewide on cable. Did these prominent namesakes 
confuse voters? 
</P>
<P>
There are other theories, too. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the vote, a group of dog-owners came forth to say they had 
brought Callow down. They faulted him for concurring in a court decision 
upholding municipal restrictions on bull terriers and other breeds deemed to be 
dangerous. In an election with a 20% turnout, some experts said, small 
special-interest groups could indeed have an enlarged impact. 
</P>
<P>
Political consultants suggested that a judge who stands for election without 
mounting a campaign is courting disaster. 
</P>
<P>
State Bar President Lowell Haverson said the result was not a fluke but a 
rebellion. He told a reporter: "Even the finest and most distinguished of 
judges are not immune from the electorate's concern about the administration of 
justice in this state." 
</P>
<P>
This theory, however, overlooks the fact that another incumbent justice, 
Richard Guy, beat a give-'em-hell challenge by former Gov. John Spellman, 55% 
to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
For all the hand-wringing about the outcome, Johnson remains mostly a subject 
of curiosity. By law, he will not take office until after he "wins" the 
November election. But, because he beat the incumbent in September, there will 
be no other candidate on the ballot. Once all justices are seated, the chief 
justice will be selected from among them. 
</P>
<P>
In his law office the other day, Johnson seemed surprised when asked what kind 
of judge he will be. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, that's a big question," he began. Then he paused. And paused more. "I've 
got the common-man, hard-working ethic. If there is such a thing as a 
blue-collar attorney, that's me . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No telling where I'll align, conservative or moderate or liberal. I don't know 
where I'll be."

FOREIGN RELATIONS: FLUSTERED NATIONS PONDER HOW TO DEAL WITH DOUBLE

<TEXT>
<P>
When East German head of state Sabine Bergmann Pohl gathered ambassadors to her 
presidential quarters last week for a toast to German unity, the celebration 
was tinged with a note of apology. 
</P>
<P>
The envoys, all 74 of them, had been put out of a job by the very event they 
had been called together to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Joining them in joblessness will be 2,000 East German diplomats, made redundant 
by the reunification taking effect today. 
</P>
<P>
Merger of the two Germanys has flustered foreign ministries and state 
departments around the globe as they ponder how to deal with double 
representation without knowing where the capital of the single Germany 
ultimately will be. 
</P>
<P>
Protocol, the code prescribing correct etiquette and diplomatic precedence to 
resolve most quandaries encountered abroad, offers no guidance on proper 
behavior in a disappearing country. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin's larger foreign embassies have simply been changing the nameplate on 
their buildings, labeling themselves consulates or branch offices of the 
elevated embassies they will report to in Bonn, which was the West German 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
While the 1,000-page treaty outlining reunification clearly designates Berlin 
as the capital, the government intends to stay in Bonn for the time being, and 
foreign governments continue to recognize the Rhine River city as the seat of 
state pending a final decision that has been delayed indefinitely. But 
tradition beckons united Germany to move its government back to Berlin, making 
foreign nations hesitant to fold their tents in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are going to have the Parliament in Berlin, it seems only logical that 
Berlin would be the seat of the government as well," said Igor V. Mironov, a 
protocol secretary at the Soviet Embassy compound in Bonn. "But this is not for 
us to decide. We have to keep both options open." 
</P>
<P>
Countries like the Soviet Union that had close ties to the East German state 
are better poised than their Western colleagues in the event Berlin is restored 
as capital. As a holdover from its status as a World War II victor, the Kremlin 
has at its command vast offices and housing that is the envy of other nations 
in overcrowded Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of room there. It would be absolutely no problem for us if the 
Germans decide to go to Berlin," Mironov said in understatement. 
</P>
<P>
While the other victorious powers, Britain, France and the United States, are 
likewise comfortably quartered in western Berlin, unification for them is more 
problematic. The coveted housing they have enjoyed under postwar occupation 
agreements reverts to the German government after today and will be offered for 
sale or rent on the skyrocketing open market. 
</P>
<P>
All three Western allies plan to consolidate their embassies in the city, 
slimming their staffs to phase out the superfluous while waiting to learn 
whether Bonn or Berlin will be their eventual headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, how does one deal with the new phoenix that will rise out of 
the ashes while trying to wind out the old operation?" said British Chancellor 
Colin Budd, among the perplexed Bonn attaches charged with blending three 
sizable facilities into one. 
</P>
<P>
Procrastination is not an option, as the capital question may remain unresolved 
for years, and maintaining large missions in Berlin will become an increasingly 
expensive burden. 
</P>
<P>
"After (unification), there will no longer be a U.S. embassy in East Berlin or 
a U.S. mission in West Berlin," explained Anthony Sariti, the newly appointed 
press department chief for the East Berlin embassy, which has now been 
diplomatically demoted. "We will be combining the two entities into a third, 
but we don't even know at this point what it will be called." 
</P>
<P>
The barreling pace of reunification caught many foreign missions by surprise 
and has complicated life for some envoys, including Sariti. He was reassigned 
from the West Berlin mission to the East German embassy before the date for 
reunification was fixed, which required him to move, at considerable government 
expense, to the eastern side of the city only a month before the distinction 
ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
"The only down sides are personal," Sariti said of the unification. "There are 
bound to be people who will have to curtail their careers because of this." 
</P>
<P>
No official orders have been issued to cut positions below ambassador, Sariti 
said. But diplomats in Bonn confirm that the attrition has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We would love to have stayed another year, but there's just no chance," said 
the wife of a Bonn attache nearing the end of his two-year assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn was already one of the U.S. State Department's biggest embassies, with 
about 450 on the staff that will now be joined by nearly 40 from East Berlin 
and 50 from West Berlin when those two representations combine and become a 
subordinate facility to the Rhine River enclave. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador to East Berlin, Richard C. Barkley, has already been 
recalled by Washington and superseded by the ambassador to Bonn, Vernon A. 
Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Career diplomats like Barkley are likely to fare well despite the quirk of 
history that has robbed them of their postings. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, East Germany's envoys will be left by the diplomatic wayside. Most 
were loyal servants of the Communist Party, and West German officials feel such 
people have little to contribute to a united, democratic state. 
</P>
<P>
East German missions abroad are already practically abandoned, as attaches have 
hurried back home in hopes of landing new employment. The East German mission 
in Bonn, once teeming with dozens of diplomats grudgingly granting visas and 
relaying messages between East and West, was down to a single receptionist more 
than a week before its official shuttering. 
</P>
<P>
While hardships are the consequence of unity for the displaced statesmen, the 
doyen of the foreign diplomatic corps in East Berlin deemed their sacrifices 
insignificant in the light of the broader, dramatic developments. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have accepted the peaceful change in East Germany with a sense of 
wonder," Lebanese Ambassador Josef Akl told his colleagues at Bergmann Pohl's 
farewell reception. All leave East Berlin with the gratification of knowing "we 
were there when it happened."

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved the 
treaty ending the post-World War II division of Germany and sent it to the full 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee had hoped the Senate could act before the unification of West 
Germany and East Germany, but the Senate recessed for the evening without 
action. 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted 19 to 0 in favor of the treaty, signed Sept. 12 in Moscow by 
Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the United States and East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After Senate approval, President Bush is to sign the treaty today, several 
hours after East and West Germany became one nation. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee said that, even though they voted for the treaty, they 
still have reservations about a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing should stand in the way of the treaty, but these sentiments need to be 
said, and we will have to watch Germany," said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), 
who was born in Berlin and fled Nazi Germany at age 2. 
</P>
<P>
Boschwitz noted Germany's involvement in wars and the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), committee chairman, said he shares Boschwitz's 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with him that we should all keep our eye on how things progress in 
Germany," said Pell, whose father, former Rep. Herbert C. Pell, helped prepare 
for the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The committee turned back an attempt by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to amend the 
treaty uniting the two Germanys with a statement reaffirming U.S. rejection of 
the Soviet Union's annexation of the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members agreed, however, to submit a parallel resolution saying the 
same thing rather than trying to put it in the treaty and delaying its 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said he and other committee members had written 
the President on Friday expressing concern about any impact the treaty might 
have on the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
He said the President is expected during the signing ceremonies today to say 
that nothing in the treaty alters the U.S. policy of rejecting the Soviet 
Union's annexations.

Germany's reunification was greeted with celebration and some trepidation at 
home and around the globe Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory statement to the German people, President Bush said that 
"45 years of conflict and confrontation between East and West are now behind 
us." 
</P>
<P>
"We expect much of our new relations," said Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, whose new diplomacy made the reunification of Germany possible. 
</P>
<P>
In his message, Gorbachev did not dwell on the immense losses the Soviet Union 
suffered at the hands of Germany during World War II but instead referred to it 
as a lesson for all. 
</P>
<P>
"Unification could not have taken place if there had not been profound internal 
democratic changes in our countries, if the right conclusions from the tragedy 
of the most horrible war had not been reflected in real life," Gorbachev said 
in a telegram sent to German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the European Community warmly welcomed 16.4 million new citizens 
into the 12-nation grouping. 
</P>
<P>
"The unification of Germany opens the door toward the unity of all of Europe," 
the EC Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, some Poles expressed concern about the new economic power on their 
western border. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, just like Japan, Germany -- because of its economic power -- is more 
dangerous than the Wehrmacht (the German army in World War II) or than Japanese 
battalions," said Marian Podkowinski, a writer and expert on German issues. 
</P>
<P>
Former Polish Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski said he is uneasy about an 
accord with Germany that fixes current borders. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be a bad prophet," he said. "But I do not exclude the 
appearance, toward the end of this century, of the (renewal of) demands 
concerning our western territories." 
</P>
<P>
A poll released Tuesday by the Wickert Institute, a public opinion institute in 
western Germany, said that 87.7% of Germans are happy about their country's 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
Another large majority, 92.3%, said unification would promote the growing 
together of European nations, and 88.3% said it would help reduce tension in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
But Heinz Galinsky, the chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, 
reminded the new nation of its "dreadful past" and demanded that it end "once 
and for all" every form of racism, anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism.

CONGRESS: LAWMAKERS EXPRESS FEAR THAT EVENTS ARE LEADING TOWARD ALL-OUT WAR 
WITH IRAQ. THE INDEPENDENCE SENDS A 'SIGNAL.'

<P>
The Senate overwhelmingly approved President Bush's handling of the Persian 
Gulf crisis Tuesday, despite growing concern among lawmakers that events are 
pushing the United States toward all-out war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring those concerns, the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence sailed into 
the Persian Gulf in what one official called a "visible demonstration" of 
American firepower, and Navy and Marine forces conducted large-scale amphibious 
landing exercises in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said U.S. forces deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation 
Desert Shield now number more than 170,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and 
Marines -- an increase of 20,000 over figures released a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has 45 warships stationed in the gulf, the northern Arabian Sea and 
the Red Sea, with another 10 in the eastern Mediterranean, officials said. They 
include the battleship Wisconsin and three aircraft carriers with more than 200 
combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Independence in the gulf marked the first time in more than 
15 years that a U.S. carrier has entered the narrow waterway. Although the 
Pentagon sought to play down the significance of the deployment, officials in 
Saudi Arabia left no doubt that it was meant to send a message to Iraq's 
President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this send a signal?" one Navy official asked rhetorically. "Hell, yes, it 
does!" 
</P>
<P>
In New York, meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that there 
is a growing consensus in the United Nations to consider the use of military 
force against Iraq if the current trade embargo does not force Hussein to 
withdraw his troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more of a willingness to consider some sort of approach like that 
(use of force), if it becomes necessary at some appropriate time, than we had 
anticipated there might be at this stage," Baker told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said he sees an "astonishing 
convergence" of views in the United Nations supporting the use of force if the 
economic sanctions fail. He said that if Hussein does not yield within a few 
weeks, it will be necessary for the U.N. to take additional action. 
</P>
<P>
If the Security Council decides to use military power, he said, Italy will 
commit its forces to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate resolution supporting Bush was passed by a vote of 96 to 3 after 
Democratic and Republican leaders assured lawmakers that their carefully 
crafted approval of the President's policies did not constitute a "blank check" 
for future military moves in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"This resolution is not an authorization for the use of force, now or in the 
future," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said. "It does (not) 
represent approval for all future actions." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those assurances, concern was clearly mounting on both sides of the 
Capitol that the Bush Administration appeared to be edging closer to a decision 
to abandon economic sanctions in favor of military action to reverse Iraq's 
occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration "is clearly thinking seriously about war in the Persian 
Gulf," Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) told a group of business leaders and government 
officials. "Real pressure (is) building for a resort to force earlier rather 
than later." 
</P>
<P>
Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, cited four converging 
pressures on the Administration to go to war: public eagerness for an early end 
to the crisis; military considerations involving the best time to launch an 
offensive; the morale of U.S. forces in the Saudi desert, and the systematic 
dismantling of Kuwait by Iraqi occupation forces. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush may have to make his decision to go to war before the embargo 
has fully played out. . . . If (he) waits for the embargo to succeed or fail 
before deciding to go to war, there may be no country left to free," Aspin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As lawmakers debated the gulf crisis, a joint force of as many as 15,000 
Marines and Navy amphibious units staged practice landings in the gulf in one 
of the largest such exercises in years. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon refused to disclose the location of the exercises, but numerous 
sources suggested that the Marines were landing on the beaches of Oman, near 
the tip of the Arabian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the exercises, involving elements of the 
4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and Amphibious Attack Group 2, will continue 
through Friday.

Jordanian truck drivers claimed Wednesday that Saudi Arabian customs officials 
were damaging their trucks as Persian Gulf politics continued to sour relations 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, too new to do any serious damage to either side, nevertheless 
underlines the Arab divisions over the gulf crisis and the proliferating 
problems they are causing. Officials in Amman and Riyadh dodged comment on the 
controversy, but the evidence was clear at their frontier. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jordanian truck drivers at the Umari border crossing, Saudi 
customs men were damaging their vehicles for no reason. 
</P>
<P>
"They were spiking holes through the (aluminum) skins of our trailers without 
even opening the doors to see what we were carrying," a Jordanian driver told a 
photographer on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The cross-border trucking dispute involved traffic going both ways. According 
to officials in Amman, it began with Saudi harassment of Jordanian trucks 
returning from the gulf, and local Jordanian officials responded by stopping 
their own vehicles as well as trucks from Syria and Lebanon, both Saudi 
supporters in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials in Amman said the drivers, carrying fresh fruit and 
vegetables to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states, had been harassed by 
the Saudis for the last two days. The dispute follows Saudi decisions to cut 
off oil supplies to Jordan and oust Jordanian diplomats from Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nickels and dimes," a Western diplomat said in Amman on Tuesday night -- 
but it illustrated the hard Saudi attitude against any country that tilts 
toward Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has endorsed United Nations resolutions demanding an 
Iraqi withdrawal and economic sanctions, but popular sentiment in Jordan 
remains strongly pro-Iraqi. The dispute started last week, coming to a head 
over the weekend when Jordanian border officials said alleged Saudi harassment 
of their trucks led to the decision to block the border traffic, including 
Syrian and Lebanese trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of fresh vegetables and fruits reaching Saudi Arabia and the 
gulf states comes through Jordan. One report said the border tie-up has doubled 
the price of imported fruit in the United Arab Emirates.

IRAQ STALLING EXIT VISAS FOR WORKERS, SOVIETS SAY 
</P>

The Soviet Union, which over the last two months has steadily escalated its 
criticism of Iraq, complained Tuesday that Baghdad has started delaying exit 
visas for hundreds of Soviet specialists whose contracts have expired and now 
wish to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Gremitskikh, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that for more than a week, 
the Iraqi government has withheld permission for 870 oil workers to leave 
southern Iraq and for 372 construction workers to leave a thermal power station 
near Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Gremitskikh stopped well short of accusing Iraq of using the workers as 
hostages, as it has used Western and Japanese men, but he warned that the 
Soviet Union expects Iraq to honor President Saddam Hussein's personal pledge 
not to inhibit the departure of Soviet personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Energetic measures continue to be taken on our part to ensure the safety and 
normal conditions for existence to our people in Iraq, and to speed up their 
departure from that country, primarily those asking to leave," he told 
reporters at a regular Foreign Ministry briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have complained privately in recent days that as Moscow's 
criticism of Baghdad has sharpened, the delays in issuing exit visas have 
lengthened, stretching in some cases to more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gremitskikh said the Soviet Union has managed to evacuate 2,617 people over the 
last two months, including all non-working women and children, but that 5,174 
of its citizens are still there. Most of the Soviet personnel are said to be 
oil field workers, doctors, teachers, engineers and specialists in a variety of 
other fields and on construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were more than 200 Soviet military advisers stationed in Iraq at 
the beginning of August -- all reportedly involved in the training of Iraqi 
troops to use and maintain Soviet weapons that the Iraqis had purchased earlier 
-- the number has now dwindled to fewer than 150, according to Soviet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
With the threat of war undiminished, concern has mounted here that the Soviet 
specialists would be caught up in a conflict and perhaps even used as hostages 
to deter Western attacks on strategic Iraqi installations.

FRUIT BAN AMID POISONING SCARE PROPER, GAO DECIDES 
</P>

The Food and Drug Administration acted appropriately and within its legal 
authority in responding to the March, 1989, Chilean grape poisoning scare, the 
General Accounting Office has concluded in a draft report obtained Tuesday by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was requested last year by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who was 
concerned about the economic impact of the FDA's actions. The congressional 
watchdog agency's draft report was completed in August but has not yet been 
released by Helms' office. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has been accused in some quarters of overreacting when it suspended 
imports of all Chilean fruits for five days after discovering three Chilean 
grapes that were tainted with cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report did not address the question of who actually had poisoned the 
grapes or where the tampering occurred, mysteries that remain unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
The international scare began when an unidentified person called the U.S. 
Embassy in Santiago on two separate occasions, claiming to have poisoned with 
cyanide fruit that was being shipped to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Upon finding the three contaminated grapes, the FDA took a series of actions 
that included suspending Chilean fruit imports for five days. The agency also 
warned the American public not to eat Chilean fruit and recommended that retail 
and wholesale outlets remove the fruit from distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"FDA's actions were consistent with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 
which requires that imported food be denied entry to the United States when . . 
. evidence indicates that the food appears to be adulterated," the report said. 
"The act also allows the FDA to issue public warnings if an imported food 
presents a health hazard." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO also noted that the FDA decided to suspend imports after extensive 
consultation with other federal agencies, including the State and Agriculture 
departments, even though it was not required to engage in such discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The Chilean fruit industry said the episode cost that nation's economy $333 
million. But the damage apparently was not permanent, since Chilean fruit 
imports to the United States a year after the incident "reached an all-time 
high," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
In conducting the inquiry, the GAO said it interviewed and obtained information 
from former FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young and other agency officials, the 
Customs Service, the Agriculture Department, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the State Department, the Chilean Exporters Assn. and import 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the agency said, it used four outside consultants to evaluate the 
FDA's testing and sample protection methods "and to assess the reliability of 
FDA's findings." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO said the FDA "used two widely accepted tests and conducted them in 
accordance with sound scientific methods."

PRESIDENT WAS WARNED TO RALLY THE PUBLIC TO DEFICIT PACKAGE OR RISK 
HUMILIATION; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: BUSH HASTILY DECIDED TO MAKE TELEVISION APPEAL AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH 
GOP CONGRESSMEN. HIS BIG PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY.

President Bush's hasty decision to make a nationally televised appeal for 
support on the $500-billion budget compromise came only after White House 
meetings Tuesday at which congressional Republicans delivered a blunt warning: 
Failure to rally the public with such a personal appeal could bring on a 
humiliating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The episode reflects how much Bush has to lose -- or win -- in the struggle 
over the budget compromise and how much his potential vulnerability is due to 
fellow Republicans. If the President should fail, the result could be economic 
chaos for the country and severe political damage for Bush himself. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats have pledged to support the controversial budget 
measure, which contains such a broad array of tax increases and spending cuts 
in popular programs that it will inflict at least some pain on almost all 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democrats have made their votes conditional on Bush's delivery of GOP 
votes. And it is Republicans who are balking -- many of them still upset that 
Bush abandoned his no-new-taxes pledge and agreed to include tax increases in 
the budget compromise worked out at the eleventh hour last weekend by White 
House and congressional negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
In putting his personal prestige on the line, Bush has raised the already high 
political stakes of a congressional struggle that conservative Republicans 
complain has been shaped more by Democrats so far than by the President and the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"This essentially is a Democratic package," charged House Minority Whip Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), who led a GOP revolt and at first vowed to defeat the 
compromise measure. "The Democratic leadership should have the burden to pass 
it. The Democrats got what they wanted, tax increases, no growth incentives, 
cuts in the defense budget and no reductions in discretionary spending." 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said in an interview Tuesday night that, with Bush, as well as House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.), leading the fight, Congress probably will pass the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
But Gingrich, still an adamant foe of the measure, will continue to lead the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that the ball is now in Bush's court and that he must pull his 
own party along with him or face blame not only for the unraveling of the 
compromise but for any adverse economic fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an acid test for his leadership," said House Majority Leader Richard 
A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). "If a President can't get his own party members to follow 
him, he's in real trouble. I'm bitterly disappointed in some aspects of the 
compromise, especially in its fairness . . . but we did the best we could. And 
we need the President to convince the American people that the only alternative 
to the compromise is fiscal chaos." 
</P>
<P>
The support of Republicans is essential for House passage because, under ground 
rules adopted by the negotiators, the compromise package must be approved by a 
majority of each party in each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"From Day One, when the President talked to Tom Foley and George Mitchell at 
the White House, the precondition of this whole thing was that both parties 
would have to support it," Gephardt said. "Our clear intention is not to put up 
more than half of our people for this unpleasant package, and the Republicans 
know it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself, in three separate sessions Tuesday with groups of House 
Republicans who oppose the compromise, warned of severe economic consequences 
if the measure fails. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gingrich had told opponents of the measure that they could hold out 
for a better deal, the aide said that Bush told the House Republicans: "I don't 
think you can get a better agreement. You've got to take the broader view. This 
is what is good for the economy. Some of you think we ought to forget this and 
use the veto strategy. But I don't see how we can get a better deal." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), one of a group of 14 House members who met with 
Bush in a session that lasted for 90 minutes, said that the congressmen 
"strongly urged the President, because of his popularity, to get on the 
television and explain thoroughly to the American people exactly what the 
consequences would be if we didn't pass the budget compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the budget negotiations, Bush had promised Democratic leaders that 
eventually he would publicly lead the fight on any budget compromise that 
emerged, but he did not make the decision to go on television Tuesday night 
until after the meeting with Shaw's group, the second of his three sessions 
with a total of about 30 House members. 
</P>
<P>
The House members strongly urged him not to delay making the speech because the 
first test vote on the compromise will be taken Thursday, when both the House 
and Senate vote on the overall budget resolution. The resolution sets the 
outlines for spending, although it does not include the detailed elements of 
the compromise package. 
</P>
<P>
The final budget package incorporating the compromise is scheduled to be voted 
on on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
A Bush aide said that he thought the President persuaded about two-thirds of 
the House members who met with him to support the budget package.

City Health Department officials were attempting Tuesday to determine the cause 
of the apparent food poisoning of more than 150 people attending a convention. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the apparent cause was food served Sunday at a hotel, but 
they added that it could be several days or even weeks before a determination 
is made. A survey of area hospitals showed that at least 155 people were 
treated for symptoms of food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
The meal at the Hyatt Regency Hotel included a green salad, chicken stuffed 
with wild rice and bread pudding with cream sauce.

TORRES ASKS MORE CITY JOBS FOR LATINOS; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: STATE SENATOR CALLS FOR REFORMS TO INCREASE HIRINGS AND PROMOTIONS. 
HE SAYS COMMUNITY WON'T STAND FOR 'BLATANT INEQUITY.'

<P>
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) complained to the Los Angeles City 
Council Tuesday that Latinos are "severely under-represented" in city 
government jobs and demanded a more aggressive affirmative action program. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he was "dismayed" by recent figures that show that Latinos make up 
37% of the county's population but only 19.5% of the city's work force. 
</P>
<P>
"The Latino community will no longer stand for this blatant inequity and 
injustice," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, Torres added, the city has made little progress in the 
hiring and promotion of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Driscoll, general manager of the city's personnel department, 
acknowledged that the underrepresentation of Latinos is "greater than any other 
minority group in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll attributed the continuing imbalance to a variety of causes, including 
the tremendous Latino population increase in Southern California. "Every 
employer's always slipping a little bit behind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres called on Mayor Tom Bradley and the City Council to enact a range of 
reforms intended to boost Latino hiring and promotions. The first step, he 
said, should be to establish an independent monitor to oversee all hirings, 
promotions and transfers. The monitor would have the authority to demand an 
explanation if future positions are not filled by Latinos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Tuesday, Bradley called Torres' remarks "a positive 
challenge" and said the city has an aggressive affirmative action program. But 
the city's demographics are changing, he said, and the program may need to be 
expanded. Bradley asked for a report from the city's personnel department 
within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he began to look into the city's hiring record after similar 
problems emerged in August with in county government. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accused the county of 
discriminating against Latinos in hiring and promotions at its huge public 
hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
The figures announced Tuesday by Torres were obtained from the city, according 
to an aide. They show that Latinos fared best in service and maintenance jobs, 
where they make up 29.2% of the work force, still below their percentage in the 
general population. 
</P>
<P>
The problem exists throughout city departments, Torres said. Latinos make up 
only 17.68% of the city attorney's 724 employees, 9% of the city controller's 
employees and 19.3% of the employees of the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll said Tuesday the city has taken a number of steps in recent years to 
step up recruitment and promotion of Latinos and members of other minority 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said the council created an affirmative action recruiting unit within the 
personnel department and the city has instituted student worker and outreach 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll said the city's civil service system includes rules that make climbing 
the bureaucratic ladder a slow enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Further, 30% of the city's professional employees are engineers, but there are 
few Latinos -- as well as blacks and women -- who graduate from college with 
engineering degrees, he said.

THE NERD FACTOR;

<P>
NIGHTCLUBS' UNWRITTEN DRESS CODES UNDER ATTACK

Comes now Kenneth M. Lipton wearing Exhibit A: The rumpled, short-sleeved 
turquoise shirt and baggy olive pants that he sported the spring Saturday night 
he was denied entrance to Mayan, a fashionable downtown nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Lipton, a San Fernando Valley attorney, took time Tuesday from his specialty -- 
dog-bite cases -- to bring the club's owner to the distinctly unglamorous 
setting of Los Angeles Small Claims Court, alleging that the Mayan violates 
state law by discriminating on the basis of appearance. 
</P>
<P>
His lawsuit, seeking $1,000 in damages for himself and three friends, is just 
one assault on Los Angeles clubs that follow the tradition of Manhattan's 
now-defunct Studio 54 by selectively admitting patrons from a crowd milling in 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
Vertigo, the first such club in this city, is also under fire. The state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department wants to suspend Vertigo's license 
because "it's unfair to the general public when they have no idea what the 
criteria are for getting in and not getting in," said Carl Falletta, the 
agency's deputy division chief. 
</P>
<P>
Both cases invoke the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act, passed in 1959 to battle 
discrimination in business establishments. Carol Sobel, senior staff counsel 
for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, believes the 
plaintiffs are on solid ground contending that what she calls "the nerd factor" 
should not decide who gets in and who stays out. "It's totally arbitrary and 
that is exactly what Unruh is supposed to prevent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Mayan, Larry Nagler, disagrees. "The act simply was not 
designed to prevent the . . . exclusion of a single patron based not on any 
class generalization . . . but instead on his or her own personality or 
individual conduct," he wrote to the court. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides in the Mayan case faced off in court Tuesday. After the 
testimony, Commissioner Diana M. Wheatley said she will take some time to think 
about the matter before rendering a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lipton continues to fume about the power of the doorman. "He was 
wearing a monk's habit and a four-foot-long cross," he said in an interview. 
"And he thought I was a nerd!" 
</P>
<P>
On May 19, the night in question, Lipton said he waited outside the club for 1 
1/2 hours with two friends, the owner of a termite control company and a school 
accounts manager. The doorman would not beckon the three past his velvet rope 
to pay $15 and gain admission to Mayan's mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
"Another guy had driven in from Oceanside with five friends," Lipton said. 
"They let in the five friends but not him." 
</P>
<P>
Watching later arrivals sweep immediately in, Lipton confronted the doorman. He 
said the doorman told him, "You're not appropriately dressed," and when Lipton 
protested that the club had no posted dress code, added, "You're never getting 
in." 
</P>
<P>
His companions said they did not participate in the exchange, but they too were 
angered by their apparent inability to meet the unwritten standards to join the 
stylish crowd inside. 
</P>
<P>
Teresita Dubrall wore a black cotton dress. Jeff Stolzer wore gray 
cotton-and-polyester pants, dark wool blazer, brown shirt, tiny hoop earring in 
his left ear and a graying ponytail. "I brushed my teeth earlier that evening," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Stephen Ambrosini said he was supposed to meet Lipton's party, but 
had already left after trying unsuccessfully for 45 minutes to get into the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
"We drove all the way down there and paid for parking. It was a waste of my 
time," Ambrosini said. 
</P>
<P>
Club owner Sammy Chao testified that a doorman thought he recognized Lipton 
from a photo as someone who had been "mouthing off" outside. If so, Chao said, 
that is the reason the lawyer could not get in. "Chances are if you are abusive 
in the front, you will be abusive inside after you drink," Chao said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers cannot simply line up for admission on a first-come, first-served 
basis, he said, because such an arrangement does not give the doormen enough 
time to observe their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan has no written dress code, said Chao, who wore an oversize black 
suit, white shirt and color-splashed tie. But the club does have "an interest 
in the safety and also the enjoyment of our patrons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An owner of Vertigo, which is located a few blocks from Mayan, watched the 
court proceedings with interest. Jim Colachis, stubble-faced and wearing a 
brocade blazer, was preparing for his own dispute with the alcoholic beverage 
control agency. No hearing date has yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover police and ABC agents were turned away from Vertigo in May and June 
of 1989. "One was dressed like a . . . well, I won't say it," Colachis said. 
"Another one was in sportswear, running clothes." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would have rejected Lipton's ensemble too. "Dressed like he is and 
not a regular customer, I would have to say no," Colachis said. "First-timers 
generally need a jacket."

WILDERNESS ROAD RISES TO NEW STATUS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: U.S. FOREST SERVICE NAMES ANGELES CREST HIGHWAY A SCENIC BYWAY, HOPING 
TO LURE MORE SIGHTSEERS TO ITS NATURAL ATTRACTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
U.S. Forest Service officer Chuck Shamblin rolled down his window as he cruised 
Angeles Crest Highway, breathing in air filled with the scent of Coulter pine, 
white fir and incense cedar trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving down the Angeles Crest Highway, late in the day, I'm thoroughly at 
peace," said Shamblin, 47, whose job as an enforcement and protection officer 
takes him from end to end of the 65-mile roadway. Under a bird's-egg-blue sky, 
he can see vistas from Santa Catalina Island north to the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Shamblin is not alone in his appreciation of the winding, two-lane highway that 
travels above the smoggy San Gabriel Valley along some of the highest mountain 
landscape in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, at ceremonies held at the road's southern end near La Canada 
Flintridge, the highway will be dedicated as a national scenic byway -- a 
first, Forest Service officials say, for a wilderness road so close to a major 
urban area. 
</P>
<P>
The Crest traverses the county's largest stretch of undeveloped land. In 
contrast to the valleys and coastlands below, not one gas station, stoplight, 
billboard or metered on-ramp clutters the route from La Canada Flintridge to 
Wrightwood. 
</P>
<P>
"Although known locally as a scenic drive, the highway's full potential has not 
been realized," according to a Forest Service report on the byway status. 
</P>
<P>
With the designation, Forest Service officials hope to attract more sightseers 
and Sunday visitors to the Crest. Signs at the eastern end of the road will 
also direct drivers toward a nearby national scenic byway, Rim of the World in 
San Bernardino National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The new classification will give the Crest more prominent status on maps and in 
tour guides. In addition, the Forest Service will upgrade visitor centers and 
signs to emphasize the highway's legend and lore and flora and fauna. Officials 
want to call attention to its rich history, including anecdotes about the Mt. 
Wilson astronomical observatory. Prohibition-era gangster Al Capone reportedly 
had a summer home in the area near the observatory, and the rugged terrain 
served as a hide-out for the notorious 19th-Century bandit Tiburcio Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Skirting the ridge tops and ravines from 800 feet to nearly 8,000 feet above 
sea level, the Crest provides access to the heart of the 650,000-acre Angeles 
National Forest in the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shamblin showed off his favorite highway. Shamblin, who oversees the 
Arroyo Seco District, which includes portions of the highway, has spent 20 
years riding the Crest. 
</P>
<P>
He knows where rocks rise above the landscape as if they were rough-hewn 
cathedral walls, where the copper-colored earth is dotted with red and yellow 
wildflowers, where the gray fox, mountain quail and Nelson bighorn sheep roam. 
</P>
<P>
The road is remote, and, as Shamblin points out, its proximity to Los Angeles 
is a blessing and a curse. It puts hiking trails within easy reach of millions 
of people. It is a delight to ride through picnic grounds, Shamblin said, and 
smell barbecues cooking food that represents the ethnic panoply of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The natural world, with its rattlesnakes and bears, can pose difficulties for 
humans along the highway. People simply interacting with one another can create 
just as many problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies are dumped along the isolated highway, stolen vehicles are stripped, 
illegal drugs are grown. It is a place of rendezvous and liaisons. Cars careen 
off the road. The unaware can slip and fall into ravines at scenic overlooks. 
</P>
<P>
Barely a 30-minute drive from downtown Los Angeles, the Crest accommodates 
diverse dramas. To illustrate the range, Shamblin cited two of his Labor Day 
weekend encounters. 
</P>
<P>
Not far up the road from La Canada Flintridge, he found a garbage bag. Inside 
were the remains of a goat, five chickens, a lamb with its heart removed and a 
homemade stuffed doll. All the animals were decapitated; red and black fabric 
enveloped them. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't a teen-age prank," he said, explaining that the bag probably 
contained the remnants of occult activity. This sort of uncommon occurrence, he 
said, is difficult to police. In this case, he was not sure if the ritual 
practices had occurred in the forest or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated event, Shamblin discovered a woman, in tears and alone. She 
said her husband, riding a motorcycle, had abandoned her because she had 
complained of saddle soreness on the ride from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the husband reappeared on the motorcycle. A Pasadena taxicab followed. The 
husband hugged his wife, gave her a bouquet of roses and helped her into the 
cab, which he had summoned to carry her home. 
</P>
<P>
Because the forest is principally a weekend playground, little weekday traffic 
appears on the Crest, save for some commuters, a few bicyclists and 
motorcyclists, an occasional sightseer or hiker, and workers for the state 
highway system or Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
As Shamblin scanned the steep hills near Kratka Ridge the other day, he said: 
"This is wall-to-wall people on a winter weekend." The highway, which is 
subject to closures during the snowy season, provides access to four ski 
resorts and a number of other recreation areas. On an average winter weekend, 
6,000 visitors come to ski; another 42,000 frolic in the snow on the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
By the time it was completed in 1956, California Route 2 -- built in part by 
convicts from San Quentin and Chino -- had been nearly half a century in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the turn of the century, the Automobile Club of Southern 
California, Pasadena officials wanting more business and the Forest Service had 
pushed for a road from Arroyo Seco in Pasadena to Cajon Pass in the high desert 
of San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Access to the forest in those days came via burros on steep trails, a cog 
railway, horse-drawn stages on dirt roads, or foot. Naturalist John Muir, who 
visited the forest in 1877, said: "The San Gabriel range is more rigidly 
inaccessible in the ordinary meaning of the word than any other that I ever 
attempted to penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
In 1919, Forest Service officials complained that it had taken firefighters 
days to get to several fires in the Angeles National Forest region. In the end, 
more than 151,000 acres had burned, showering ash over Pasadena and darkening 
the skies from San Gabriel Canyon to Pacoima Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Fires such as these eventually provided the momentum for construction to begin 
in 1929. Because of the rugged terrain, the highway was built "in fits and 
starts," said John W. Robinson, author of several books on the San Gabriels. 
"But everything changed with the construction of the Angeles Crest -- the 
backcountry of the San Gabriel Mountains was all of the sudden accessible." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the highway also provides access for commuters from Palmdale and 
Lancaster, who use and sometimes clog the Crest south and west of its 
intersection with Angeles Forest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic volume on the road's lower end reflects the commuter growth. Last year, 
the average daily count -- factoring in high weekend rates and lower weekday 
ones -- was 3,400 vehicles, up from 2,100 in 1979. Yet at more remote portions 
of the Crest, such as Chilao, the count has stayed constant at 1,000 vehicles 
daily during the same 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday at Dawson Saddle, the highest point on the Crest, there was 
only one car parked. Melrose Avenue hairdresser Charles Smirnoff sipped a soft 
drink as he sat in his 1969 red Karmann Ghia convertible. 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, Smirnoff said, he travels the Crest to relax. "I come here, as 
the old saying goes, to commune with nature." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

The Angeles Crest Highway, more than 40 years in the making when it was 
completed in 1956, will be dedicated in early October as a National Scenic 
Byway, a first for a wilderness road so close to a major urban area.

A NEW BEGINNING IN SOUTH-CENTRAL; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: HUD HAS TAKEN OVER A TROUBLED APARTMENT COMPLEX. BUT MANY RESIDENTS 
ARE WARY THAT THE AGENCY'S PROMISES WON'T BE KEPT.

<P>
"I can't believe this!" Beatrice Bentley, 37, shouted to a neighbor as she 
surveyed a batch of newly planted flowers and a working sprinkler system that 
doused the browned grass of her apartment courtyard Tuesday. "I am so happy!" 
</P>
<P>
This was a new beginning. As small a sign as it was, the treatment of the 
courtyard greenery after a year of general neglect was one sign of hope for 
Bentley and a thousand other residents at Ujima Village in the wake of the 
federal government's plan to take over the South-Central complex and try to 
reverse its decade-long slide into decay. 
</P>
<P>
But even amid the hope over the government's unique campaign came open 
skepticism. To the low-income residents of the Willowbrook complex who have 
complained of an eight-year wait for routine housing repairs in their federally 
subsidized units, the promises sounded too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all kind of hurting from what we've seen in the past," Tanya Washington, 
28, a mother of five with a sixth on the way, said as she prepared lunch for 
the children in their cramped, two-bedroom apartment. "My house is falling 
apart. Sure, in a couple of days we may see some quick changes, but how long is 
it going to go on? We need some results." 
</P>
<P>
Added Charlene David, a leader in the village tenant council: "We've been 
promised so many things before and been ripped off so many times, we've learned 
our lesson. We'll wait and see the results." 
</P>
<P>
With the complex's most recent owners owing nearly $2 million on their 
mortgage, officials with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
visited the village Monday -- with security guards and repair people in tow -- 
to announce that they are taking over management and temporary ownership. They 
said they plan to spend millions to fix up the complex, in the 900 block of 
East 126th Street, to beef up security and to reclaim the property from alleged 
gang members, drug dealers and gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
Once foreclosure on the village is complete, U.S. officials plan to turn it 
over to the residents themselves and a private, not-for-profit development 
group for ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have described the troubled housing complex as among the 
worst-run in the state. This is the first time in California -- and one of a 
handful of examples nationwide, they said -- that they have moved this quickly 
to take over a privately run housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials assert that unlike the steady stream of private developers who 
have owned the 300-unit project in its two-decade history, they are ready to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next week, site managers will make door-to-door inspections at the 
complex as part of a preliminary, $4.3-million renovation plan that is to 
include everything from removal of recently discovered asbestos to repair of 
toilets, said Lawrence Wahl, vice president at Alpha Property Management of Los 
Angeles, chosen by HUD to manage the work. 
</P>
<P>
Further down on the wish list: extermination of roaches and rats that have 
inhabited some parts of the complex; repair of hole-riddled roofs and nearly 
collapsed porches and stairways, and the renovation of boarded-up, abandoned 
apartments now home to graffiti and garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Fuller, 56, who has lived at the village since 1972, said that despite 
twice-monthly requests, she had to wait eight years to get a new paint job to 
replace a peeling coat, and six years to replace an old carpet that had given 
way to a floor with holes and exposed nails in it. 
</P>
<P>
The delays made her "furious," Fuller said. But she kept her frustrations 
mainly to herself for fear of jeopardizing her federally subsidized rent, once 
as low as $48 for a two-bedroom apartment and now at $180. "Not much you could 
do," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The skepticism of Fuller and others at the village about their future was 
echoed by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, who runs a job-training program at the 
site. "This really doesn't mean anything unless and until HUD puts the money 
into it and gets the management that can run the place," said Waters. "So far, 
it's just an 'almost' action." 
</P>
<P>
But others asserted Tuesday that tenants must look among their own ranks to 
reverse the building's deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen Smith, an eight-year resident and maintenance manager at the 
complex: "If you don't take some pride in where you live, you can't blame 
anyone else. . . . You can't just rely on Uncle Sam. Who ran the place down to 
begin with, who's selling the dope here . . . who's flashing the gang colors? 
Not the government, not the owners." 
</P>
<P>
While the federal takeover dominated small talk in the laundry room and in the 
courtyard Tuesday, it had not reached one group of young people who spent the 
noon hour shooting dice and drinking beer under a stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds good to me," one 20-year-old said when told about the government's 
renovation plans. But when told about the beefed-up security that is planned, 
he looked at his buddy and said with a laugh: "I don't know about that."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT ARRESTED AFTER JEWELRY CACHE 
DISCOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrol officers checking on an unrelated dispute at a North Hollywood house 
arrested a suspected thief after discovering suitcases stuffed with an 
estimated 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of allegedly stolen jewelry, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Burglary detectives and patrol officers spent more than 20 hours cataloguing 
the jewelry after the arrest Monday night of Edmund Sykes, 39, on suspicion of 
robbery and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the jewelry -- mostly watches, necklaces, earrings and pins -- is 
believed to have come from dozens of burglaries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives have connected some of the jewelry to two residential burglaries in 
the San Fernando Valley and identified Sykes as a suspect in two robberies, Lt. 
Ron LaRue said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UTILITIES SET UP PROGRAM TO SAVE WATER, 
ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's four largest utility companies on Tuesday formed a joint 
conservation program to install water and energy-saving devices in households 
across the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Water-Energy Conservation Partnership will work to 
extend existing conservation programs and determine new ways to save resources. 
Officials from the Metropolitan Water District, the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, Southern California Edison and Southern California Gas Co. 
said they will soon distribute to about 32,000 Southland homes new toilet tank 
flappers to reduce water use. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects being considered include combined conservation awareness 
campaigns and sponsorship of joint exhibits at trade shows and county fairs.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS VOTE TO STUDY PARKING LOT OVER 
FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County supervisors on Tuesday voted to study construction of a double-deck 
parking structure over the Hollywood Freeway in downtown Los Angeles, just west 
of the proposed "West Coast Gateway." 
</P>
<P>
In approving the $350,000 study, supervisors said that construction of the 
parking lot over the freeway between Grand Avenue and Hill Street would free up 
a county parking lot for development of a high-rise office. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are looking to lease county parking lots to private developers 
to raise money to support county operations. Preliminary estimates put the cost 
of the parking structure at $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
The project requires approval of the state Department of Transportation.

THEY WISH. STATE HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE NOT DECIDED IF THEY WILL APPEAL.

A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has given renewed life to a group that 
freezes the dead in hopes they may be revived someday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Aurelio Munoz ruled Tuesday that it is illegal for the state Department 
of Health Services to refuse to provide death certificates and body disposition 
permits for those who want their bodies frozen after death. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, those who had chosen to have their bodies frozen after death have 
been left in legal limbo. The state had refused to issue death certificates or 
other permits, which relatives often needed to settle estates and obtain 
insurance payments. 
</P>
<P>
In a written opinion, Munoz said people have the right to dispose of their 
bodies as they wish. However, he noted that if the state wants to regulate the 
cryonics industry, it first must set up licensing and regulatory procedures. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials have not decided whether to appeal the decision or to 
set up such regulations, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Tammy Chung, who argued 
the case for the state. "We obviously did not agree with the decision," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was hailed as a "total victory" by David Epstein, attorney for 
Riverside-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation, the nonprofit business that 
took the state to court. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor President Carlos Mondragon said the ruling will give increased 
credibility to cryonics and predicted his business will "skyrocket" as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor filed the suit in 1988 on behalf of television producer Richard C. Jones, 
who went under the name Dick Clair. An Emmy-award winning writer for the Carol 
Burnett Show, Clair was hospitalized with AIDS. The hospital refused to allow 
Clair to give his body to Alcor, saying state officials told them it was 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor went to court and obtained a temporary restraining order from Munoz that 
directed the hospital to release Clair's body upon his death. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor subsequently obtained and froze Clair's body, one of 16 in cryonic 
suspension at the facility. Another 280 people are in the process of signing up 
for the program. Among those waiting are a Xerox scientist from Palo Alto and a 
computer engineer from San Jose, who were also plaintiffs in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor charges $100,000 to freeze an entire body and $30,000 for only the head. 
The fees are usually paid by life insurance policies, which clients sign over 
to Alcor. 
</P>
<P>
The cryonics movement was started in 1962 by a retired Michigan college physics 
instructor and has been most popular in California. Alcor conducted its first 
freezing of a body in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
In the cryonics process, entire bodies or sometimes just the heads are placed 
in receptacles that look like giant stainless steel Thermos bottles. These 
receptacles are filled with liquid nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
Cryonics proponents believe that by the time science advances to the point 
where the dead can be revived, it also will be able to make new bodies for the 
frozen heads. 
</P>
<P>
Critics concede the process may be hypothetically possible. But they also say 
that today's technology is too limited to prepare the bodies for future 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor President Mondragon said that after a Northern California cryonics 
company went out of business and allowed bodies to thaw out in the early 1980s, 
the health department decided not to issue any permits for cryonics. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor Attorney Epstein contended that the group was caught in a "Catch-22" 
situation. State law says firms dealing with bodies -- such as cryonics 
businesses -- must be licensed by the health department. However, Epstein said, 
the health agency does not provide such licenses for cryonics. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature was mistaken in assuming that the health department had a 
mechanism in place to license such organizations," said Chung.

SUSPECT IN THREE USC RAPES LINKED TO PREVIOUS ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A WEST COVINA WOMAN SAW PHOTO OF SUSPECT IN USC ASSAULTS AND IDENTIFIED 
HIM AS THE MAN WHO BROKE INTO HER HOME LAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
A man accused of raping three USC students has been linked to another assault 
on a woman, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Damone Taylor, a convicted rapist who is being held without bail on 21 
felony counts stemming from the USC rapes, is under investigation for attempted 
rape in the alleged attack last year of a West Covina woman, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman saw Taylor's photograph on a television newscast last week and 
contacted police to report he was the man who broke into her home on Oct. 14, 
1989, tied her up and attempted to sexually assault her, West Covina police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In that incident, according to investigators, the woman managed to get loose 
and fight her attacker before he fled. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina and Los Angeles police said they were able to match Taylor's 
fingerprints with prints taken from the West Covina crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
"They (West Covina police) ran our suspect's prints against the lifts they had, 
and it matched," Los Angeles Police Detective Dave Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
The West Covina victim, a 40-year-old receptionist, suffered minor injuries in 
the struggle with her assailant, who fled with her money and jewelry, West 
Covina Detective Dennis Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the assailant entered the woman's home through an open or unlocked 
sliding back door. She discovered him standing in her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred during a six-week period when Taylor was on parole from 
state prison, Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 28, was paroled from prison during the last week of September, 1989, 
after serving 2 1/2 years of a six-year sentence for the 1985 rape of a Long 
Beach woman, police said. He was arrested again during the first week of 
November for prowling and giving false identification to a police officer -- 
parole violations -- and sent back to prison, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was freed again on Sept. 5 of this year, 11 days before the first USC 
rape. 
</P>
<P>
In his arraignment on Monday, Taylor pleaded not guilty to the USC attacks. 
Municipal Judge Judith Abrams ordered his bail revoked after prosecutors 
reported that Taylor had threatened to kill his victims if they went to the 
police. A preliminary hearing was set for Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is accused of breaking into a woman's apartment near the USC campus 
around dawn on Sept. 16, raping the 20-year-old student who lived there and 
stealing a small amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
He is also charged in the Sept. 26 rapes of two 20-year-old roommates who lived 
just north of the campus. Each was tied up while the other was raped. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Atty. Andrew J. McMullen, who is prosecuting Taylor for the USC 
rapes, said he would consider filing additional charges against Taylor for the 
West Covina attack.

ASPIRIN FOUND TO CUT DOWN OCCURRENCE OF MIGRAINE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS SAY TAKING ONE EVERY OTHER DAY CAN REDUCE THE RATE OF 
HEADACHES BY 20%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taking an aspirin every other day can significantly cut down on the occurrence 
of migraine, according to new research that offers hope to many of the 
estimated 25 million Americans who suffer from the excruciating, inexplicable 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The finding, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
suggests yet another surprising new use for the old drug. Over the past few 
years, aspirin has been found to prevent heart attacks, stroke and 
pregnancy-induced hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
"Migraines are incredibly debilitating," said Dr. Julie Buring, a Harvard 
Medical School professor and co-author of the new paper. ". . .The hope is that 
they can be prevented rather than have to be treated once you get them." 
</P>
<P>
There is no widely accepted means of preventing migraine -- intense and chronic 
headaches often accompanied by nausea. The drugs most commonly tried are 
heart-disorder drugs that often cause serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings emerged from a now-famous study of more than 22,000 male 
physicians exploring the value of taking a single aspirin every other day in 
preventing heart attacks, cataracts, angina, periodontal disease and a host of 
other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, 6% of the physicians who took aspirin, compared with 7.4% of 
those who did not, reported having had a migraine during the study period. That 
suggests that aspirin reduced the migraine recurrence rate by 20%, the 
researchers concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Though the study did not explore whether regular doses of aspirin reduced the 
severity and duration of the headaches, the researchers said participants in 
the study told them that the treatment did have that effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a magic bullet in terms of a preventive factor for 
migraine," said Buring, an associate professor of preventive medicine at 
Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital. "But right now, there's 
not a tremendous amount we have to offer people." 
</P>
<P>
Several specialists in the field said they were not surprised by the finding. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Neil Raskin, a professor of neurology at UC San Francisco, said he would 
have expected that aspirin might help those people with recurring headaches not 
severe enough to drive them to a doctor. But he said he thought it would be of 
little help to those with disabling headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. D. J. Dalessio, a consultant in neurology at Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation in La Jolla, said many patients already take aspirin in hopes of 
preventing migraines. He said he would suggest it for people with migraines 
occurring at least weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin is not without side effects. Because it works by thinning the blood, it 
can be dangerous for people with bleeding ulcers, and it can cause nausea, 
indigestion, heartburn, stomach problems and constipation in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers theorize that aspirin works against migraines by controlling the 
release of serotonin, a chemical believed to help trigger migraines. Serotonin 
is released by blood platelets when them stick together; aspirin inhibits that 
clumping together of platelets.

NHL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
NO QUESTION, THE GAME HAS PLENTY OF ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Stanley Cup is back at its old home at Edmonton, where it resided 
through much of the 1980s, the NHL is entering the bright new world of the 
1990s with a new wave of popularity in the United States, a new wave of 
interest in the Sun Belt and a new wave of Czechoslovakians everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer has been hailed perennially as America's sport of the future, but the 
future seems to have arrived for hockey. 
</P>
<P>
As the NHL prepares to drop the puck on its 74th season Thursday night, the 
curtain appears ready to fall on the old era of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
No longer can the entire league be dismissed with the old Rodney Dangerfield 
line, "I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out." No longer does a 
majority in this country plead ignorance at the mention of icing the puck. No 
longer can Canadians claim the puck stops there. 
</P>
<P>
But along with the new popularity and the big bucks have come big problems. 
</P>
<P>
On this eve of another season, what's ahead for the NHL? The best way to answer 
that question is with 18 others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. How popular is the league? 
</P>
<P>
Attendance reached record levels last year for the 11th consecutive season, 
with nearly 14 million people attending NHL games, including the Stanley Cup 
playoffs. Locally, in the second year of the Age of Gretzky, the Kings achieved 
a new high: 628,274, with 32 sellouts in 40 regular-season dates. At 
Pittsburgh, Mario Lemieux has proved the equal of any Steeler or Pirate in the 
T-shirt and autograph-signing market. Two weeks ago, 25,581, the largest crowd 
in NHL history, paid up to $99 a seat to watch the Kings and the Penguins play 
an exhibition game in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. Will there ever be an NHL team in Florida? 
</P>
<P>
Will there ever be ice? In games at both St. Petersburg and Miami, promoters 
found a good crowd is great, but a good Zamboni ice-grooming machine is even 
better. In a few spots, the Kings and their opponents were horrified to find 
themselves skating on concrete. But those kinds of problems will be solved. And 
when they are, don't be surprised to find the Miami Heat joined by the Miami 
Ice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. When will that happen? 
</P>
<P>
According to its master plan, the NHL will add seven teams to its current 21 by 
the end of the century. There were a lot of chuckles when that idea was 
announced, especially when the league is charging expansion teams a $50-million 
entry fee. But the new Bay Area club, the Sharks, is already preparing for 
1991-92, and the line at President John Ziegler's door has formed, with 
interest stretching from San Diego to Milwaukee to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. If the league is so popular, why isn't it on U.S. network television? 
</P>
<P>
Low ratings chased hockey off the national tube more than a decade ago. But the 
NHL made a brief return last season with a live network telecast of its 
midseason All-Star game. The hope is that continued attendance increases and a 
truly national league, containing franchises everywhere from the Sun Belt to 
the Pacific Northwest, will persuade network executives to again take a chance. 
Failing that, NHL officials hope to get more cable exposure. The violence 
remains a sticking point, but it would seem that a medium with room for 
"American Gladiators" and professional wrestling could put up with a few 
out-of-control goons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5. Why doesn't the NHL just stop the violence? 
</P>
<P>
That's up to Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6. What does he say? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anything. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7. Hasn't the league cracked down more on the fighting? 
</P>
<P>
Yes it has, but you'll know league officials are serious when they pass one 
simple rule: You fight, you're gone. No long stays in the penalty box. No stiff 
penalties. Anybody who throws a punch is thrown out. Plain and simple. It works 
in other sports, so there's no reason to think it wouldn't work in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8. Why hasn't the league already done this? 
</P>
<P>
Because of a lingering fear it will alienate the fans it already has, 
completely ignoring the potential fans it fails to attract because of the 
stigma of fighting. True, incidents of violence are down, but one game like 
last season's record-breaking brawl between the Kings and the Edmonton Oilers 
offsets all the good publicity the NHL accrued over a season of fewer fights. 
If the Kings' Marty McSorley and the Oilers' Mark Messier, who struck the first 
blows, had been tossed out at the start of that game, the violence would have 
ended there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9. What other problems does the league face? 
</P>
<P>
Drugs. Revelations of such problems have paled in comparison to big brothers 
basketball, football and baseball. But the Bob Probert case last season and the 
Grant Fuhr case this year indicate that might be changing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10. What can be done? 
</P>
<P>
One answer might be a drug rehabilitation program such as other sports have. 
Ziegler maintains that the league doesn't have a drug problem. So when cases 
surface, he simply suspends the player, hoping he has also suspended any 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11. What's the good news? 
</P>
<P>
For players, it's money. Loads of it. Seven players, led by Wayne Gretzky, are 
earning in excess of $1 million a year. The recent million-dollar-plus 
contracts of Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins, Chris Chelios of the Chicago 
Blackhawks and Scott Stevens of the St. Louis Blues elevated defensemen into 
the high-rent district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12. Can the owners afford it? 
</P>
<P>
No way, says almost every owner in every sport. Of course, that's the same 
thing they say when they're asked if they want to sell their clubs. But the 
Kings, despite the NHL's highest payroll, went from a $5 million loss to a 
profit of slightly more than $5 million in Gretzky's first year in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13. What will be the biggest change in the league this year? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Czechs. A year ago, everybody was yelling, the Russians are coming! 
They came, they saw but they hardly conquered. The Soviet players had little 
impact. Sergei Makarov was rookie of the year but wasn't much help when his 
Calgary Flames fell to the Kings in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14. Will the Czechs be better? 
</P>
<P>
Many clubs think so. NHL teams selected 21 players from Czechoslovakia in this 
year's entry draft, as opposed to only eight last season. Czechs expected to 
help this season include wing Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh, who scored 60 points 
in 51 games last year in his native country; center Bobby Holik and defenseman 
Jergus Baca of the Hartford Whalers, wing Richard Kron and defenseman Jiri 
Slegr of the Vancouver Canucks, wing Zdeno Ciger of the New Jersey Devils, 
center Robert Reichel of Calgary and goalie Dominik Hasek of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15. What's new in the league? 
</P>
<P>
Five coaches: Doug Risebrough of Calgary, Bryan Murray of the Detroit Red 
Wings, Bob Gainey of the Minnesota North Stars, Dave Chambers of the Quebec 
Nordiques and Bob Johnson of Pittsburgh. Murray is also general manager in 
Detroit, as is Coach Mike Keenan in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16. Who figures to be strong in the Campbell Conference? 
</P>
<P>
It would be foolish to discount Edmonton after its performance in the Stanley 
Cup finals. Although they have lost wing Jari Kurri, who bolted the NHL during 
the summer to play in Italy, the Oilers still have the speed, goaltending and 
defense to rate as favorites. After all, this team survived the loss of 
Gretzky, didn't it? Calgary, Chicago and St. Louis should also be in 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
17. How about the Wales Conference? 
</P>
<P>
Boston will be back. But this might be the year for the Buffalo Sabres, 
strengthened by the acquisition of Dale Hawerchuk, to make a strong run. 
Montreal also has a shot, as does the survivor of the competitive Patrick 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18. How will the Kings do? 
</P>
<P>
With Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato on his line all season, the old Gretzky 
may be back. Unfortunately for them, unless all their question marks on defense 
are answered, the old Kings also may be back.

In his fourth game as USC's quarterback last season, redshirt freshman Todd 
Marinovich led a 91-yard, 18-play touchdown drive in the last 3 1/2 minutes, 
lifting the Trojans to an improbable 18-17 victory over Washington State at 
Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
In his fourth game as UCLA's quarterback, redshirt freshman Tommy Maddox passed 
for 273 yards and the go-ahead touchdown with 7:55 left, helping the Bruins 
overcome a 10-point second-half deficit in a 30-20 victory over Washington 
State last Saturday at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"They're different in their style," said Cougar Coach Mike Price, who will get 
a second look at Marinovich Saturday night at the Coliseum. "Marinovich is a 
little more deliberate in his throwing motion -- a lot of left-handers are. I 
don't know if they are, but they look like they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Maddox doesn't have that over-the-head delivery. He's got a three-quarters 
sidearm delivery and lets the ball go quickly. But they're both excellent. I 
was very, very impressed with Maddox. And of course, Marinovich -- we made his 
year last year." JERRY CROWE

SMITH CALLS REFEREE 'WIMPY'; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: USC COACH SAYS THE OFFICIAL SHOULD NOT HAVE CONSULTED COACHES ABOUT 
SHORTENING GAME. HOWEVER, RULE BOOK SAYS BOTH TEAMS MUST CONSENT.

Before allowing USC's rain-shortened victory over Ohio State to fade into 
history, Trojan Coach Larry Smith Tuesday called the referee "wimpy" and said 
the controversy surrounding the game's ending could have been avoided with 
cooperation from ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Ron Winter ended Saturday's nationally televised game at Columbus, 
Ohio, with 2:36 left and USC leading, 35-26, and in possession of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
After Ohio State scored with 2:38 remaining to pull within the final margin, 
Smith and Ohio State Coach John Cooper met with Winter at midfield, agreeing 
that if the Buckeyes couldn't regain possession on an onside kick, the game 
would be halted. 
</P>
<P>
A severe thunderstorm hit the area, drenching the players and a crowd of 89,422 
in Ohio Stadium. So, when USC's Bruce Luizzi fell on the kick, the game was 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Winter, a Big Ten official since 1976 and line judge in USC's 
20-17 victory over Ohio State in the 1985 Rose Bowl game, was wrong to meet 
with the coaches before ending the game. Cooper has been criticized for 
agreeing to allow the game to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a coach's call," Smith said. "When something like that hits, the 
referee is in charge of the game. He's in charge of the safety of the players, 
the coaches and the fans, and that's his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm going to be perfectly honest with you: He was wimpy about it. That's 
the best way I can say it. I'll probably get reprimanded, but I don't give a 
damn because they were Big Ten (officials) and they can't bring anything on me. 
I hope. You never know. 
</P>
<P>
"You're worried about what you say in the newspaper about officials, but I 
still stick by what I say. It was wimpy. It was a wimpy decision all the way 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"That's their responsibility. It says it right in the book. Coaches have 
nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
But according to the 1990 NCAA Football Rules and Interpretations Manual, the 
referee does not have the authority to end a game without consulting the 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
According to the rule book: "The referee may temporarily suspend the game when 
conditions warrant such action. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It shall be terminated . . . only by mutual consent of both teams." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mark Rudner, director of communications for the Big Ten: "The rule book is 
quite clear." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he was unaware of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that about 45 minutes before the game was ended, officials informed 
both teams that a severe storm was going to hit the area and that when it did, 
a decision would be made as to ending or suspending the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, to me, the TV people should have been told, and the commercials should 
have been knocked out in the fourth quarter," Smith said. "If we'd done that, 
we'd have finished 15 minutes before the (most severe) storm hit. Real simple. 
It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure that baby out. 
</P>
<P>
"And then they could have run all their damn commercials at the end, when they 
(showed) the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Rudner said that ABC-TV was aware of the impending storm. 
</P>
<P>
"They reported that during the broadcast," Rudner said. "In fact, they even had 
a scene from the blimp; they showed the radar on the blimp showing the storms 
that were approaching." 
</P>
<P>
But "as long as the game was going on, ABC had every right to its commercial 
time," Rudner said. "They're permitted three 90-second commercials in each 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Said an ABC-TV spokesperson, asking not to be identified: "We're not in a 
position (to) cancel commercials. Nobody knew exactly when the storm was going 
to hit."

Detroit television reporter Virg Jacques filed an assault and battery complaint 
against Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons, saying the NBA All-Star choked him 
and threw him against a car. 
</P>
<P>
There were differing versions of the incident that left Jacques cut on the 
neck. Jacques said, "If he says I confronted him or provoked him in any way, 
he's lying." Thomas could not be reached for comment, but Piston spokesman Matt 
Dobek said that Thomas and center James Edwards, who witnessed the 
confrontation, said that Jacques followed Thomas out of the gym, and refused to 
let Thomas into Thomas' car. After Thomas gained entry, Jacques stood in front 
of the car as Thomas tried to drive away, Dobek said.

The Phoenix Suns said they will offer first-round draft choice Jayson Williams 
a one-year contract for the minimum $170,000, and he probably won't be on their 
NBA roster this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Colangelo, the Suns' president, said he had a verbal agreement with 
Williams, a 6-foot-10 forward from St. John's, and his agent, Bob Woolf, on a 
contract Aug. 5, but Woolf then informed Colangelo that his client was 
considering signing a one-year, $1.5-million contract with the Italian team, Il 
Messaggero. 
</P>
<P>
That deal never materialized, and Williams joined the Suns for informal 
workouts on Sept. 13. However, Colangelo withdrew his original offer of about 
$600,000 a season for five years.

Chris Gonzales is for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
As manager of the Imperial Valley Wildlife Area's Wister Unit, between 
California 111 and the Salton Sea, Gonzales is caretaker of more than 6,000 
acres, on which he has spent many a blistering summer day preparing for the 
autumn arrival of thousands of ducks and geese. 
</P>
<P>
Levees separating ponds, baked in the sun and cracked by daytime temperatures 
of 120 degrees, are being repaired. Seeds have been planted in five different 
types of soil -- most of it poor. Ponds are being flooded, water structures 
replaced or fixed. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of building waterfowl habitat area in the desert, on the side of a hill, 
in salty earth," Earl Lauppe, wildlife management supervisor for the Department 
of Fish and Game, said of the annual task facing Gonzales and his small, 
overworked crew. "You start with that perspective, you might get an idea why it 
takes so much effort to build the dykes, levees, ditches and keep this place 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, 57, has helped keep the place -- the largest public hunting area in 
Southern California -- going for the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't care less about the brewing controversy over private clubowners' 
right to attract waterfowl to their lands with out-of-sack grain. It's a 
practice that started -- with DGF permits -- in the 1950s to alleviate crop 
depredation on nearby agricultural lands. Ducks and geese would fly in for the 
winter, devour and trample the crops, then fly out in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Crop depredation is no longer an issue, because of a change in agricultural 
practices and a sharp decline in the number of ducks. The U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service has therefore labeled the practice "biologically unsound," and 
two years ago issued an edict banning it before the start of the 1990-91 
season, which was supposed to open Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
But 30 or so clubs still use grain, and owners of a dozen have taken the matter 
to federal district court in San Diego, where on Oct. 10 a judge will decide 
whether to issue a restraining order, allowing the practice to continue while 
the court decides its fate. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales has no comment. "I think it's best if I don't say anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bickering over whether the clubs in the area should be able to attract 
incoming waterfowl with grain does not concern Gonzales. Providing and 
maintaining habitat and natural feed for the birds that use Wister does. 
</P>
<P>
The habitat looks healthy at the state-run wildlife refuge and it appears 
ready, not only for the thousands of migrating birds due to arrive in the next 
few weeks, but for the thousands of hunters awaiting the start of the 1990-91 
waterfowl hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales doesn't care that opening day of Southern California's split season is 
still undecided, long after the DFG proposed -- and most hunters planned for -- 
an Oct. 13 opener. Nor does he about the reasons for the possible delay. 
</P>
<P>
His concern is how to best use the land and water the DFG pays a high price to 
extract from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually are spending money on water that we shouldn't be spending if we're 
going to go Oct. 27," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will decide Thursday whether to keep the original date of Oct. 
13, or to change it to Oct. 27. It claims it has been receiving letters from 
"private individuals" asking that it delay the season-opener for two weeks 
because there will not be enough birds in the area on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all the comments are that we're starting the season too early," said 
Dan Connelly, wildlife coordinator for the DFG. "It's too hot, there aren't any 
ducks around and that people will prefer to have a later season." Connelly then 
contradicted one commission member by saying, "The feeding clubs are an issue" 
in the commission's consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Al Taucher, an ardent supporter of the feeding program over the years, denied 
that the commission will base its decision on the desires of those who operate 
feeding clubs, but did say delaying the opener makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pintail (duck) habitat down there in the early part of the (season)," he 
said. "But if they can only shoot one (the limit on pintails is one), wouldn't 
it make sense to prolong the season so they could get more (productive) 
shooting in?" 
</P>
<P>
His reasoning made sense until a check of the records showed that of the 966 
ducks taken at the state-run hunting area during the Oct. 14 opener last 
season, only 96 were pintail. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales doesn't want to get involved, but he pointed to a wide variety of 
species of ducks congregating in the ponds at Wister and said he expects 
thousands more in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some show as early as July," he said. "Most are here by late October. They're 
here by the thousands." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brown, who belongs to a nearby "non-baiting" club -- those opposed to the 
practice call it baiting -- says the commission's choice as an alternative 
opening day is no coincidence and hints that it is bowing to pressure from 
influential owners and members of the feeding clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The law requires that no shooting take place until 10 days after the last 
kernel of bait has been removed," Brown wrote in a column that appeared last 
Thursday in the San Diego Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if the clubs lose in court on Oct. 10, the first Saturday they would 
reasonably be able to hunt would be Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Bauer, migratory bird coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
said: "If the decision would go against them, that would give them some time to 
clean up the grain and still have that 10 days and the opening of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' response: "We have to put the water in whether it's the 13th or 27th. 
We have to be ready for either day." 
</P>
<P>
After the USFWS issued its edict, Cliff Lawrence, owner of the Rancho de los 
Patos club, said: "The feeding program keeps the ducks here. I predict that 
after two years (of not being able to feed) we will lose 50% of the waterfowl 
habitat in the Imperial Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game Commissioner Taucher agreed, saying: "I am in favor of the 
feeding clubs. When the ducks come in, their feed is gone in a couple days. 
Besides keeping them there, it also gives them a chance to rest. Instead of 
moving on to Mexico, well you know what happens in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed among supporters of feeding-baiting that if it is 
stopped, the birds would continue down the flyway and face slaughter in Mexico, 
where hunters and guides have little or no regard for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Maier, executive vice president of Waterfowl Habitat Owners' Alliance at 
the time of the edict, said: "Without (feed), ducks would clean out the natural 
food and leave. These soils are poor. Sure you can produce crops -- you need 
(costly) drain tiles to do it. It's no big trick to grow waterfowl plants, the 
question is abundance. Besides, they're feeding on natural food first anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' response to all this: "They say there's nothing out there, the birds 
are starving, there's nothing for the birds to eat. We have cattails, a lot of 
cattails. We chop the cattails, and the geese like to eat the shoots when 
they're still young. We have cattails, alkali bulrush, over 1,000 acres of 
swamp timothy, which is very high in protein. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A tour over 36 miles of dirt roads that slice their way back and forth across 
Wister also revealed sunflowers, watergrass, ryegrass and atriplex. 
</P>
<P>
"There are (plants) out there I don't even know the names of, but the ducks eat 
it," Gonzales continued. "There is plenty for them to eat out there, and I 
don't want anybody telling me (otherwise)." 
</P>
<P>
He has the backing of the USFWS. Bill Henry, a biologist who was stationed at 
the nearby federal wildlife area when the edict came out, advised feeding-club 
owners: "The soil temperatures are very warm, so the (ponds) should be drained 
quickly before salinity increases. Water is the key to growing desirable 
amounts (of swamp timothy) and reducing salinity -- draining at proper time, 
irrigating at right time, leeching it to reduce salinity . . . it may take two 
years on some of the poor ground." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer said last week: "We came out with an evaluation report stating it can be 
done. We've shown that. You don't blink your eyes, and it doesn't happen 
overnight. And it's no more costly than putting feed out. 
</P>
<P>
"Their bottom line is they want us to let the feeding program continue as it 
has over the last many years, where we've gone in on the statement that we 
think it's in violation of federal baiting regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The practice isn't allowed anywhere else in the country. Time will tell if it 
will continue in Southern California, and what its impact on waterfowl will be. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gonzales vows "to manage this area for all wildlife," including the 
endangered clapper rail, the pheasants introduced last year, the quail, doves 
and other upland birds. And of course for waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is for the birds," he says.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HIGHLANDER BACK FILLED RUSH ORDER; 
</P>
<P>
GRANADA HILLS TURNED TO WASHINGTON WHEN PASSES MISSED MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a record born of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
On Granada Hills High's first possession Thursday night, quarterback Bryan 
Martin misfired on three consecutive passes, prompting a punt and a bit of 
offensive retrenching. 
</P>
<P>
Next time we get the ball, co-Coach Tom Harp remembers thinking, we run the 
tank through the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
On first and 10 from the Granada Hills seven-yard line, Martin handed the ball 
to fullback Brett Washington, who broke through the line on a dive play, made a 
nifty cutback and bolted a school-record 93 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about it," Harp said, "is that it came after those three 
straight incompletions." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the best was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
In a span of 6 minutes 29 seconds of the second quarter, Washington scored 
three times. Before the game ended, the 6-foot, 220-pound senior scored a fifth 
touchdown, setting seven school records as Granada Hills spanked Compton, 48-7. 
</P>
<P>
To think it all started with failure. Compton opened the game in man-to-man 
coverage, which threw a wrench into the Highlanders' first series. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we started off, we couldn't do anything," Martin said. "I'm 0-fer and 
we couldn't throw any high-percentage passes. We didn't establish much." 
</P>
<P>
Except about every rushing record in the book. Once more, the particulars of 
Washington's memorable outing: 
</P>
<P>
* The 93-yard run broke the mark of 89 set by Kurt Schumacher against Bell in 
1974. Washington had tied the mark three weeks ago in Granada Hills' opener 
against Lynwood. "After that," Martin said, "you had the feeling that every 
time he got it, he was gone." 
</P>
<P>
* Washington's 252 yards broke the single-game mark of 218 set by tailback 
Khalid Ali in a 1986 game against Westlake and his five touchdowns broke Ali's 
single-game mark of four set in the same game. His 30 points broke Greg 
Fowble's single-game record of 28 set against Van Nuys in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the single-game records. Some would call this a career night, for 
three indisputable reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's 252 yards give him 2,216 in his two-plus seasons, carrying him 
well past Ali (2,062) as the career rushing leader. Washington's five 
touchdowns also broke two career scoring marks. Washington has scored 27 
rushing touchdowns, besting Ali's mark by three. Washington, who entered the 
game tied with Ali at a record 27 total touchdowns, now has 31. 
</P>
<P>
An eighth mark nearly fell. In the opening moments of the fourth quarter, an 
18-yard scoring run by Washington was nullified by a penalty and the Highlander 
drive stalled at the Compton six-yard line. Had the touchdown counted, 
Washington -- who has scored 186 career points -- would have blown by Fowble 
(187 points) as the career leader. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK," Washington said. "I'll take five." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Washington rarely takes five. He also starts at outside linebacker, 
where he was selected The Times' Valley Lineman of the Year as a junior. 
Highlander co-Coach Darryl Stroh, who handles the defense, says he can't afford 
to sit Washington down. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't find anybody to play Washington's spot on defense, and I've tried all 
60 guys," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh admitted that he sometimes marvels at Washington's tools. 
</P>
<P>
"His greatest moves are when he runs straight up off tackle," Stroh said. 
"He'll stop, throw them that leg, then disappear. You say, 'Oh my, how can he 
do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Washington attempts to explain, saying: "I have pretty good speed and good 
eyesight. I just look for the seam. I go right for the seam." 
</P>
<P>
If not the throat. Compton Coach Mike Wells, who played tight end for three NFL 
teams, remembers what ran through his mind as the burly Washington blasted 
through his team. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Geez, get a load of this guy,' " said Wells, who failed to catch 
the double meaning of his statement. 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret where Washington generates his speed and power. His thighs are 
so big that when he played last season on the junior varsity basketball team, 
coaches were unable to locate a pair of uniform trunks large enough to fit him. 
</P>
<P>
Said Washington: "Everybody asks me if I'm working on my legs, and I don't. I 
never did squats or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Never did squat? Ali, who had five school records obliterated, wouldn't agree. 
Washington admitted that he doesn't know much about the former tailback, who 
played from 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Stroh) said he was a good player," Washington said. "He must have been 
to play at Granada Hills and set all those records." 
</P>
<P>
So imagine what it takes to knock Ali's marks out of the books. Someone who 
floats like a butterfly and stings. . . .

HARVARD CLAMPS DOWN ON CRESPI, 8-6; 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO: SARACENS SWITCH DEFENSES AND RALLY FROM 3-0 DEFICIT TO HAND CELTS 
THEIR FIRST LOSS AFTER 11 VICTORIES.

<P>
One of two referees scheduled to officiate the water polo match between Crespi 
and Harvard highs on Tuesday failed to show for the Saracens' 8-6 victory at 
Harvard. For part of the first quarter, it looked as if the Saracens were 
missing as well. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi, ranked fifth in the Southern Section 3-A Division, took an early 3-0 
lead in the San Fernando Valley League opener. But the Saracens switched from a 
man-to-man to a zone defense, made a few substitutions and reverted to form. 
Harvard (11-2), ranked fourth in the 3-A Division, scored three goals late in 
the first quarter, shut out the Celts (11-1) in the second and third quarters 
and held off a late charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out slow, but we just needed to change defenses," Harvard Coach Rich 
Corso said. "We didn't need to make an adjustment on offense; the defensive 
changes were what changed the game." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard senior John Krawetz, coming off the bench, scored the first goal of the 
comeback with 1 minute 30 seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disappointed about the beginning," Krawetz said. "I was able to drive 
up and get free. At that point, we still had enthusiasm for the match, but we 
needed something to get us going." 
</P>
<P>
A minute later, Harvard's star sophomore, Jim Toring, scored and sophomore Ryan 
Salceda added the tying goal with nine seconds left in the quarter. The 
offensive explosion came after Corso switched out of a zone defense to a 
physical man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
The defense neutralized Crespi's big guns, Jean Michel and Vince Greco, and the 
rest of the Crespi team for two quarters. Some Crespi players felt that the 
change was effective because there was only one official. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of tension between the players," said Greco. "Having only two 
eyes, you can't see everything. It would have been nice to have the second ref. 
If there were two refs, the match would have been under control." 
</P>
<P>
Toring put Harvard ahead to start the second quarter, but the Celts shut out 
Harvard's star scorer the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We held Toring to two goals. Most of the time he is scoring five," said Crespi 
Coach Jeff Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
While Toring struggled, Krawetz added his second goal, Salceda scored twice 
more, and Matt DeFronzo scored once. 
</P>
<P>
"Crespi marked our big guys," Salceda said. "It was up to the rest of the four 
starters and the bench to do the job. We did." 
</P>
<P>
With Crespi trailing, 7-3, in the fourth quarter, Greco tried to lead the Celts 
back, scoring twice in the final three minutes with goalie Tim Behrens also 
scoring.

ST. GENEVIEVE FOOTBALL COACH CLEARS HIS PLAYERS IN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Genevieve High Coach Mark Lovett will not take disciplinary action against 
his players for their role in a brawl that ended Saturday's nonleague football 
game against Salesian at Roosevelt High in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Game officials stopped the contest with 4 minutes 15 seconds remaining and St. 
Genevieve leading, 32-22, after a fight broke out on the St. Genevieve 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve was accorded the victory. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lovett and a Times reporter, the brawl began when Salesian 
quarterback Carlos Alvarez threw a punch at a Valiant player on the St. 
Genevieve sideline after being forced out of bounds short of a first down on 
third and five. 
</P>
<P>
Salesian players and spectators rushed toward the St. Genevieve sideline, but 
coaches and police officers restored order within five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more like a wrestling match than a fight," Lovett said. "It could have 
turned into a real ugly situation, but nobody seemed to be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The stands were cleared and Salesian players were led from the field. St. 
Genevieve playersremained on the field and were led to their buses 15 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, spectators threw ice and soda cans at St. Genevieve players going to 
the locker room at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I heard and from people I talked to, it isn't our fault," said 
Lovett, in his second season. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, none of our players were the cause of it." 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve and Salesian have a two-year contract that expires next year 
after the teams meet in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lovett said the contract would not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Salesian Coach Jerry Scott could not be reached for comment. St. Genevieve 
suspended an assistant coach and two players after the Valiants took part in a 
fight with Chaminade during a nonleague game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting the reputation for being a fighting school," Lovett said. "We 
haven't had a kid kicked out of a game this season and we're just trying to get 
the program winning." 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve, 1-9 last season, is 2-2. Bill Clark, a Southern Section 
administrator, said the incident is under review, pending a report from each 
school.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: ANOTHER VELASCO MAKES BURBANK SIT UPRIGHT AND PAY 
ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfonso Velasco is following in the kicking shoes of some pretty impressive 
folks as he begins his high school career at Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Alfredo Velasco, 23, was the first in the family to play football at 
Burbank. He went on to kick at UCLA from 1986-89 and ranks second on the 
all-time Bruin list for field goals (51) and scoring (267 points). In 1988, he 
made 17 of 19 field goals to set the UCLA single-season record for percentage 
(.895). 
</P>
<P>
Salvador, 22, a two-time Western State Conference selection at Glendale College 
and now a senior kicker at the University of Hawaii, was next. 
</P>
<P>
Abelardo, 21, was the third. The Cal State Northridge senior has made 46 
consecutive points after touchdown for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Abelardo has not missed a PAT since Sept. 10, 1988 and holds the Northridge 
record for extra points with 85. He is only five shy of the Matador record for 
field goals in a career with 25. 
</P>
<P>
But Alfonso, 14, who has been getting some help from Abelardo on the weekends, 
might be the most versatile of the four. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso is the quarterback, as well as the punter and kicker, for the Burbank 
freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
"He kicks real nice," Burbank Coach Randy Stage said of Alfonso, who has a 
65-yard punt this season. 
</P>
<P>
He is accurate, too. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso has converted all eight extra-point attempts this season and all three 
field-goal attempts, including a 40-yard kick. 
</P>
<P>
Take a number, please: Alfredo, Salvador and Abelardo wore jersey No. 10 while 
at Burbank, but the number was retired by the school after Abelardo graduated. 
Alfonso wears No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Next of kin: Eugene Saldana was Burbank's kicker two seasons ago and his 
brother Adam handled the chores last season. The Saldanas, who were 
All-Southern Section 3-A Division soccer players at Burbank, are the Velascos' 
cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Wild thing: Sometimes, Cleveland High quarterback Dave Erhardt seems a tad 
self-destructive. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Coach Steve Landress said Erhardt needs to start acting like a 
quarterback and "not like a linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's 14-14 tie with Monroe, Erhardt was knocked out of the game with a 
bruised hip after taking on a Monroe defender. Landress said that Erhardt might 
not play this week. 
</P>
<P>
Erhardt apparently likes to dish out punishment too. After a Cleveland drive 
stalled earlier in the game, Erhardt punted the ball and was among the first 
players downfield. Landress said Erhardt hit the Monroe return man so hard the 
player was knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Eclectic: Spotted on a shelf in Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney's campus 
office were several cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside tapes by heavy metal rockers Van Halen, the Scorpions, Guns 'N Roses, 
Def Leppard and Iron Maiden was one labeled "Joe Paterno." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows it's windy: The notorious Quartz Hill wind could play a role in 
Friday's game between Quartz Hill and Hart in Lancaster. Known for whipping 
into the Antelope Valley with a vengeance, the "Hawk of the Hill" is something 
that has turned Quartz Hill into a team that loves to run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, however, likes to air it out. And if that autumn wind is kicking up 
Friday night, the Indians may be in trouble. Then again, if Hart quarterback 
Ryan Connors really is the next coming of Jimmy Bonds, the wind may not be a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel Coach John Albee likes to tell the story of the time in the mid-'80s that 
a Bonds-led Hart team came to Quartz Hill on a night when the wind was whipping 
fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
"I swear it was coming in at 30 m.p.h," Albee marveled. "And it didn't faze 
Bonds one bit. He was still hitting his out patterns. Unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Hart won that game, and has beaten Quartz Hill six years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Full strength: Antelope Valley Coach Brent Newcomb will be the first to say 
that the school's current talent pipeline is not up to the standard of years 
past. But he'll also be the first to say that one can't judge the 1990 
Antelopes until the team is going at full throttle. This week's clash with 
powerful El Toro may be the first glimpse of fully healthy Antelopes. 
</P>
<P>
The key is at quarterback, where junior Mike Fossati, tabbed as the starter 
throughout the preseason, will make his first start. 
</P>
<P>
Fossati separated his shoulder in practice Sept. 1 and didn't return to action 
until two weeks ago. Even then, he was relegated to duty at wide receiver while 
he regained strength in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Antelopes have remained ground creatures, passing just 21 
times in a 1-3 start against some of the Southland's toughest teams. Fossati's 
return, however, may give the team a new dimension. 
</P>
<P>
"His shoulder's still tender, so we're taking it as we can," Newcomb said. 
"When he's healthy, we expect to throw more. It should be a real shot in the 
arm for us." 
</P>
<P>
So to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries: Village Christian will be without a large portion of its ground game 
Saturday against Southern California Christian. Main cogs Chad Everett (272 
yards, three touchdowns) and Rick Nickels (112 yards, five touchdowns) were 
injured in Village Christian's 14-14 tie with Camp Kilpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Nickels, who sustained a knee injury, is expected to be out for about two 
weeks, but should be ready for the Crusaders' Alpha League opener against L.A. 
Baptist on Oct. 13. Everett has a hip bruise and will sit out this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wrangler: The Fillmore defense is sure to garner its share of attention from 
Frontier League teams this season, and not just because the coach is named 
Curtis Garner. 
</P>
<P>
The Flashes are the stingiest of defenders, yielding just 115 yards a game. 
Standing tall in that crew is senior linebacker Jason Rangel. 
</P>
<P>
Garner says that Rangel is a potential All-Southern Section selection who leads 
the team in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said that whatever the opposing offense is running, Fillmore sets up 
a Rangel station. As a result, he has been chosen the team's defensive player 
of the game three times in Fillmore's 4-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kid who has been holding us together," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Fillmore: But don't get too excited about Fillmore's 4-0 start, says the 
coach. Fillmore has notched wins over Pater Noster (26-0), Oak Park (17-0), 
Western Christian (37-6) and Paraclete (21-7). Traditional Frontier League 
favorite Santa Clara, meanwhile, has stumbled to a 1-3 start with losses to Rio 
Mesa (34-21), Agoura (3-0) and Santa Ynez (29-11). 
</P>
<P>
None of this is lost on Garner. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have to take into consideration who they're playing," Garner said. 
"I mean Marmonte League (Agoura) and Channel League (Rio Mesa) teams are heavy 
hitters. They're playing some big teams, not a Pater Noster or a Western 
Christian." 
</P>
<P>
Getting his kicks: William Rivera had dreamed of kicking the winning field goal 
at the end of a game, but he never thought the opportunity would come so soon. 
</P>
<P>
With two seconds remaining and Burbank trailing Beverly Hills, 25-24, last 
week, Rivera, a soccer player participating in his first football game, nailed 
an apparent game-winning 36-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't ready for it," Rivera said. "I thought that I would have to wait at 
least a couple of games." 
</P>
<P>
It looks as if Rivera will have to wait. Officials ruled that time had expired 
and nullified Rivera's kick. 
</P>
<P>
"I was positive that I saw two seconds on the clock when I kicked it," said 
Rivera, who made a 40-yard field goal earlier in the game and was perfect in 
three extra-point attempts. "I thought we had won and I raised my hands and 
started running around, but then I saw Beverly Hills run onto the field and 
heard the officials blow the whistle and knew something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the whole experience was unforgettable for Rivera, who was 
persuaded by friends to try out for the football team two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous that I upchucked on the way there," said Rivera, who brought 
the field-goal tee out for the opening kickoff. "I didn't know what to do. 
There are so many rules I still don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Words of wisdom: Some advice for Paraclete Coach Jim Nottoli as the Spirits 
prepare for Friday's game with Cantwell: Don't ask Maranatha Coach Dave Hogan 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lovett, the St. Genevieve coach did, and he regretted it. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us what to expect and we prepared for it all week," Lovett said. But 
when Lovett got a look at the Cantwell junior varsity, whose game preceded the 
varsity contest, he began to wonder if he had come to the right school. 
</P>
<P>
"They were doing something completely different," Lovett said. "We tried to 
come up with a strategy real quick and I was writing formations on the 
locker-room door, but we were down 20-0 before we could figure out how to stop 
it." 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve lost, 27-12. 
</P>
<P>
Sign language: Harvard Coach Gary Thran likes to keep his players involved. 
</P>
<P>
In Harvard's 34-28 victory over La Canada, Greg Peters used hand gestures from 
the sidelines to signal the plays to quarterback Steve Kezirian. 
</P>
<P>
Kezirian threw for 109 yards -- including a 50-yard touchdown pass -- in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Kezirian was on the sidelines gesturing to Peters, who was 
playing quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both very close in ability," Thran said. "We want to give them both 
equal playing time and this was a way to help them keep their heads in the 
game. They have a lot of fun and came up with the signals themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even figure them out." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball note: Simi Valley pitcher Bill Treadway, 15, who last season became 
the first freshman to pitch on the Pioneer varsity, will rest his pitching arm 
for six weeks because of pain in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
An exam has disclosed that Treadway, whose fastball was clocked in the low-80 
m.p.h. range last summer, will not need surgery.

CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM OVERTAKES FRESNO STATE

Behind the 18-kill effort of outside hitter Nancy Nicholls, the Cal State 
Northridge women's volleyball team Tuesday won its third consecutive match, 
dumping Fresno State, 11-15, 17-15, 15-13, 15-7. 
</P>

Nicholls, a sophomore from Cleveland High, made only six errors in 41 attacks 
as CSUN ran its record to 12-5. 
</P>

BOOKS: L.A. WRITER T. CORAGHESSAN BOYLE'S LATEST WORK, 'EAST IS EAST,' IS A 
SOUTHERN NOVEL WITH A JAPANESE TWIST.

History probably will not record Thomas Coraghessan Boyle's march through 
Georgia. Unlike Gen. William Tecumseh ("War is Hell") Sherman, the ruthless 
Union Civil War commander who ravaged the Peach State in his epochal drive to 
the sea, Boyle left no burned towns, pillaged farms and impotent wrath in his 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
Nope. 
</P>
<P>
But it's easy to imagine the swath the Los Angeles writer and three buddies cut 
while researching his latest novel, "East Is East" (Viking, $19.95), in a trek 
through a rural landscape dotted with swamps, alligators, country stores and 
Mother's Day church suppers for the lost and hungry. (All you can eat for $5.) 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there just aren't that many big, ol' wide, white Lincoln 
Continental convertibles left on the road. At least not with Boyle in them. 
</P>
<P>
So, picture it: Boyle -- a lean, frizzy-haired, pale novelist, teacher, 
reformed punk and Westchester County, N.Y., native -- checking out the Southern 
mores, the flora, fauna, cuisine in a gas-guzzling dinosaur of an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
There he is, a man who has seen a chunk of the world, a veteran of media 
exposure, a guy with an admittedly large literary ego, owner of a house in 
Woodland Hills, staying for a couple of days in a remote county where the 
outlets for fun -- maybe even electricity -- are, well, limited. 
</P>
<P>
What's he going to do? 
</P>
<P>
Get in the spirit of things, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Up the street from the motel, Boyle and company spied the local Dairy Queen. 
They soon discovered the drive-in was "the nexus of social life in Clinch 
County, Ga." because "everybody, all day and all night long, cruised around 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Ever eager for new cultural experiences, the intrepid adventurers "got in our 
car and cruised around it too." 
</P>
<P>
Throw in a church supper ("Would you boys like some more tea?") that Boyle and 
his companions discovered while lost on a back road, a trip to Georgia's Sea 
Islands, a tour of Savannah and a two-day canoe trip in the Okefenokee Swamp. 
Add it up and you have a pretty good tally of how much actual, on-the-ground 
Southern research Boyle did for the new novel. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Boyle, 41, admits, he is massively unqualified to publish a Southern 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no right to write a Southern novel because I'm not from the South," he 
explains. "In fact, my joke is that I'm thoroughly qualified to write about 
Georgia because I've flown over it several times on my way to Miami." 
</P>
<P>
And we haven't even gotten to the Japanese aspect of this business yet. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, the Japanese angle. 
</P>
<P>
"East Is East" isn't just a Southern novel. For Boyle, a lover of complexity, 
that would be too simple. It's really a Southern-Asian novel because it's about 
a Japanese sailor named Hiro Tanaka who jumps ship and creates havoc among the 
natives after drifting and swimming to the Georgia shore. 
</P>
<P>
No, no. That's not right either. 
</P>
<P>
The characters also include an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent 
from Los Angeles and a bunch of writers in an artists colony. 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe the safest thing to say is the novel contains a conglomeration of 
things, some Southern, some Asian and some pure Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
The novel sprang from a story that a friend saw in a newspaper, Boyle says. It 
was about "an Asian seaman (who) had jumped ship somewhere in the south of the 
United States, had been at large for six weeks and when he was captured was 
emaciated and full of bug bites." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle told his friend, "Boy, that's right up my alley, you know me well. It's 
got swamps, everything." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its origins in a fuzzy set of facts, "East Is East" is, above all, an 
exercise in imagination, Boyle says, noting that his first novel, "Water 
Music," was about African explorer Mungo Park. Not unexpectedly, Boyle has 
never been to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"Since you're creating the world, you can put anything in it you want," he 
says, "and I've always been very fascinated with fish, with swamps, with 
animals who live in them, with human excrement, with muck, with the processes 
of the body, with the names of trees and plants and animals and their life 
cycles, all of that stuff. . . . It is fiction, it is an exercise of the 
imagination, it is a test of how strong your imagination is." 
</P>
<P>
Yep. Sounds like the kind of stuff you gotta care about in the backwoods. 
</P>
<P>
But don't go thinking that Boyle has gotten countrified and owns a pickup truck 
full of blue tick hounds. 
</P>
<P>
He's way too hip for that. Georgia was fun, but he seems more smitten by Japan, 
where he traveled last summer, sponsored by the U. S. Information Agency, to 
give a series of readings and lectures. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from picking up a small grasp of the language and a kaleidoscope of 
impressions, Boyle recalls with delight a series of small encounters. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he met a man who urgently told him, "I love you. I love America. 
But I do not love your economics." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle says he replied, "I love you. I love Japan. I am not an economist." 
</P>
<P>
While Boyle's sense of humor is a key personal characteristic -- and an 
important feature of his novels and short stories -- it may obscure his iron 
discipline and ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to Los Angeles in 1977 to teach writing at USC, Boyle has 
published seven books -- three collections of short stories and four novels. 
Two of the latter, "Water Music" and "World's End," were so hefty that some 
speak of the novels' "throw weight," a term usually applied to nuclear 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Boyle's short story collection, "If the River Was Whiskey," raised 
some eyebrows by being published in the middle of the furor over Salman 
Rushdie's novel "Satanic Verses," which provoked an Iranian call for Rushdie's 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Into this international furor, Boyle thrust a collection that included a story 
about a Los Angeles public relations man retained to improve the image of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. (Rushdie, of course, remains in hiding somewhere 
in England.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Hard Sell" may have been one of the author's more restrained 
offerings. His other short stories have included a talking statue of the Virgin 
Mary, a guy who wants to be famous so badly that he tries to ride on the wing 
of a jet and a woman who requires her lover to wear a "full body condom" when 
they make love. 
</P>
<P>
All of the books are still in print and over the years Boyle's critical and 
popular reputation have built steadily. 
</P>
<P>
That trend continues with "East Is East." Some 45,000 copies are in print and 
the book already has made four regional best-seller lists, including Washington 
and San Francisco. The number is some 20,000 more than his last novel, "World's 
End," racked up. Critics have called "East Is East" "irresistible," 
"brilliant," and "another triumph." 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiastic receptions for "World's End" and "East Is East" apparently 
have ameliorated some of Boyle's sharper hungers. 
</P>
<P>
When "World's End" appeared three years ago, Boyle was impatient for a larger 
audience, his literary ambitions seemed closer to the surface and he spoke at 
length about scaling the heights of American literature to bump elbows with the 
likes of John Updike and William Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Boyle seems to have mellowed. He still has his penchant for 
unconventional clothes, offbeat hairstyles and earrings. His attire at an 
interview included a T-shirt emblazoned with a reproduction of the dust jacket 
of "East Is East," for example. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Boyle appears considerably more detached about the fame game, 
partly, perhaps, because he is more satisfied with the way things are going. 
</P>
<P>
This week, for example, Boyle is scheduled to appear on "The Today Show" and 
"Late Night With David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
While the appearances are a sign of arrival, Boyle sounded wary of the tube. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think that I will enjoy being on those shows. In fact I know I 
will not enjoy being on them and don't really want to be on them," he said. 
"I'm going on there because I think it will help the success of the book. I 
don't want to be schmoozing on late-night shows like Truman Capote, stoned out 
of my mind and not doing my work." 
</P>
<P>
And for all his brazen exterior, there is a conventional, domestic side to 
Boyle that may protect him from the more bitter fruits of egotism and talk 
shows. He has been married for 16 years. He and his wife, Karen, have two sons 
and a daughter. They live in a good -- but not palatial -- house not far from 
the Ventura Freeway and Boyle is fond of showing visitors around his suburban 
domain. 
</P>
<P>
This sober side of Boyle speaks out in favor of slow but sure progress in the 
literary marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as you get there, I think it can be very rewarding," he said. "The 
danger of hitting it right off the bat is what do you do for your next act? 
Everybody is waiting to shoot you down and say, 'Ah, this guy was a flash in 
the pan.' I can't complain. My career has built steadily and I'm getting more 
and more attention." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, after his touring for "East Is East" ends in a few weeks, Boyle 
promises to recede from the limelight for a while. "The public needs a break," 
he said. "I've had three books in three years. They've probably seen enough of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
While his flair for self-promotion -- now backed strongly by his publisher's 
scheduling and advertising -- probably has helped his career, Boyle also knows 
that the books are the thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to work each day," he says. "The most frightening 
thing is to lose inspiration . . . for whatever reason -- maybe because there's 
too much pressure on you, maybe because you don't really have any inspiration. 
Who knows where it comes from to begin with? So that terrifies me. I don't feel 
good unless I'm working every day." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle says he might feel even better if the weather in Southern California were 
worse. Ever since moving here, the mild climate has bugged him, prompting 
frequent longing for lowering skies and bitter winds. 
</P>
<P>
A sharper distinction in the seasons may some day prove stronger than his 
attachments to Los Angeles, he hints. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have the Easterner's prejudice against the weather here particularly," 
he says. "I hate sunshine. I love USC, the job I have there. I like the fact 
that Los Angeles has really supported my career here a lot . . . I live here. 
My children were born here. I have close friends. It would be difficult to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet, particularly in these four years of drought, I just get kind of a 
hankering for that lushness of the East Coast. I know it's boring there. I know 
there are a lot of mosquitoes. I know I'll regret it if I go back. But I just 
want to see some gloom and misery. . . .For me, a bright sunny day, especially 
after 12 years of them, doesn't make me feel good."

HURTING AND EXHAUSTED TO EXTREME, NAVY SEAL RECRUITS BATTLE TO FINISH COURSE

<P>
On the third morning of Hell Week, the class of SEAL recruits paddled their 
rubber dinghies 15 miles. After breakfast, the men swam 400 yards in their 
uniforms and boots and ran eight miles in the deep sand. Mark Kaldi, a 
23-year-old seaman, fainted during the run. 
</P>
<P>
"You quit while you passed out," a SEAL instructor told Kaldi, whose face was 
green. "You know why you passed out? Not enough exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Kaldi stared at him blankly and swayed slightly as if he might faint again. The 
instructors ordered the 54 men to line up again in the sand. "They think they 
are going to run again," an instructor confided. 
</P>
<P>
But Kaldi didn't line up, panicked at the thought of another run. His teammates 
clustered around him whispering encouragement. Kaldi shook his head. "If he is 
going to quit -- it'll be now," an instructor said. 
</P>
<P>
The whistle blew. Class 172 lined up, Kaldi among them. 
</P>
<P>
"That man Kaldi just gained incredible self-confidence just by the fact that he 
went to the starting line," the instructor said. They ended the bluff and 
marched Class 172 off for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
During Hell Week, the most intense period of training to become a Navy SEAL 
(sea-air-land commando), men undergo not only physical but mental stress. For 
the first two days of Hell Week, trainees had been tossing and kicking 
250-pound logs, shoulder-pressing 180-pound boats, swimming, running, and 
crawling. Except for four one-hour meals a day, the men were almost constantly 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-week instructors began an almost diabolical mental assault on their 
exhausted charges, who had slept less than one hour in three days. 
</P>
<P>
With so little sleep, hallucinations are common. During the dinghy ride, one 
man insisted that a wall was rising out of the ocean. Another thought a 
battleship was following his boat. 
</P>
<P>
Second-class petty officer Kenneth Graham, a 22-year-old St. Louis native, said 
he fell asleep and tumbled into the water during the 15-mile paddle. Engineman 
apprentice Tim Speer, a 21-year-old Springhill, Fla., native, was luckier -- he 
fell asleep and toppled into his boat. 
</P>
<P>
"These sleep attacks really get to you," Speer said later. "But we didn't come 
here to go to our limit and stop -- we came to go beyond. You start saying, 'I 
am hurting, I am putting out as much as I can. I am at my limit.' The 
instructors say you are not and you keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Hell Week, which hits during the sixth week of a 25-week training program, is 
likely to remove any man not absolutely certain about his commitment to become 
a SEAL. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to train Mrs. Jones' little boy for combat and train him so he 
comes home," said Capt. Douglas Huth, commanding officer of the Naval Special 
Warfare Command here, where SEAL training is conducted. 
</P>
<P>
As Class 172 went through Hell Week two weeks ago, Navy officials allowed The 
Times unusual access to the exercises and men involved. 
</P>
<P>
At breakfast on Wednesday, the class was numb with exhaustion. The men 
struggled to keep their eyes open -- a task which had become increasingly 
difficult. Several men slept standing as they waited to be served food. 
</P>
<P>
"You look around and see people's eyelids get heavy and you start to think 
about it," said Lt. Anthony McKinney, a 25-year-old Newport, R.I., native. 
"Extreme pain is extremely good -- it means you are really building your body 
up to be what they want you to be." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, like many others, had hoped for several years that he would get the 
chance to become a SEAL. Because he had punctured a lung, as well as breaking 
his shoulder and three ribs in a car accident during his college freshman year, 
McKinney had to obtain a medical waiver to attend the SEAL program. "There's no 
way I would quit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat groups found shortcuts to make their work a little easier. One boat 
group arranged to have its boat repaired by a former student. This man repaired 
the floor board and fixed a nozzle that leaked. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of feel obligated to help," said the seaman, who also gave them a 
cleaning kit. "I cheer them on." 
</P>
<P>
On the sly, one man popped tablets of ibuprofen, an over-the-counter pain 
reliever, and aspirin. Though he could have gotten these medications from the 
hospital corpsman, he preferred to sneak them so it would not be entered on his 
medical records. One boat group arranged to have other students supply a stash 
of such pills in a non-functioning light-switch plate in their barracks. 
</P>
<P>
And they found other ways of working around instructors. When asked to lie in 
the surf, they linked arms and, as a group, they surreptitiously allowed the 
waves to push them closer to shore. Though none talked back to instructors, 
many cursed beneath their breath. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the men were zombies. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk to them and there is no brain -- you just keep them moving," said a 
senior SEAL instructor. The pace of exercises slowed. The men didn't trot but 
marched and stumbled. They cleaned their barracks, endured races in the sand, 
stretching exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Doing somersault relay races on the beach, one man began to vomit in the sand. 
"Get in line. If you gotta puke, throw up on the guy in front of you," an 
instructor yelled. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, they napped for 50 minutes. Starved for sleep, their bodies 
retaliated. Limbs swelled; fingers and joints puffed up. When they played water 
polo for two hours in a pool, sheets of dead skin floated off their feet. 
</P>
<P>
Because of severely chafed groins and armpits, Class 172 has perfected the 
bow-legged "Hell Week walk." They hobbled and many turned their toes out, 
Charlie Chaplin-style. With oozing sores in their armpits, they held their arms 
away from their sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is hurting. There is no degree of bad anymore," said William (B.J.) 
Whitted, 28, a Virginia Beach, Va., resident, who went through Hell Week with a 
stress fracture in each leg. "They are going to get you wet and make you cold. 
It just doesn't matter anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Whitted originally started with Class 171. But one day during training when he 
was carrying a man, he felt excruciating agony in his legs. Doctors diagnosed 
stress fractures and recommended he wait at least four months to allow his legs 
to recover. But Whitted decided to try again seven weeks later, this time with 
Class 172. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts. It hurts bad. Every step you take it's like someone strikes your 
legs," said Whitted, father of a 5-year-old girl and the most senior petty 
officer of the class. "They run you into the dirt. They beat the hell out of 
you. You have to want the program really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the men considered dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to quit. The saltwater was getting on my chafing and I wanted to 
quit," said engineman fireman apprentice Phillip Beaumont, an 18-year-old 
Corbin, Ky., native. "I was ready to cry I hurt so bad." 
</P>
<P>
But Beaumont didn't. The boat crews helped each other out. The stronger men 
shouldered the weaker ones. The limping ones leaned on others. Some, like 
corpsman Clint Livermore, said they cannot quit because they have hitched so 
much to the dream of being a frogman. 
</P>
<P>
When Livermore quit his job as an engineer at Hughes Aircraft Co. and joined 
the SEAL program, a number of people were startled. It was a move that meant a 
loss of more than two-thirds of his annual $42,000 income. A 27-year-old Santa 
Maria, Calif., resident with a receding hair line, his classmates called him 
'old man.' 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting at my desk, at my computer, I thought there has got to be more to 
life," Livermore said. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m. Thursday, Livermore and the others had gotten less than two hours of 
sleep in the past four days. Wearing wet uniforms, they were ushered into a 
heated classroom where classical music played on a radio. The instructor 
welcomed them to the creative writing class. The men were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"You will not sleep -- you will write," he ordered. The assignments were 
surreal: Describe your last moments as a lobster placed in a pot of boiling 
water; being a drunk Viking at a party when a buddy makes a pass; being a fly 
partially destroyed by a poorly aimed blow from a swatter; and brushing your 
teeth only to be transported to another planet. 
</P>
<P>
Classroom 122 steamed up. The heat was oppressive. The men tried desperately to 
stay awake and write. One by one, they keeled over and fell asleep at their 
desks. One by one, the instructors woke them and motioned them to silently 
leave the room. Finally, only two men remained: McKinney and Joseph Peters, an 
engineman. Before each, the instructor placed a signed form indicating that the 
man had quit -- 12 hours before Hell Week is over. Then they shook the two 
awake. 
</P>
<P>
The men were devastated. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be here. This doesn't make any sense. I didn't quit," McKinney 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
He and Peters were shaking. They could not comprehend what had happened. The 
instructors allowed them to twist with their own uncertainty and confusion for 
20 minutes. Then they were returned to class. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kinda scary," McKinney said. "But it was meant for me to make sure that 
no matter how stressful, I never let down my defenses -- I agree with that." 
</P>
<P>
If McKinney were an instructor, would he try that on a trainee? "Yes," he said, 
"it was a good trick." 
</P>
<P>
For six hours, finishing at 6 a.m. Friday, Class 172 was ordered on a 
meandering "treasure hunt." Feebly, they put together clues and found 
instructors. Their pain and fatigue was almost palpable. After breakfast, seven 
of eight boat crews paddled three hours to a demolition pit. The other crew, 
which won the most points awarded for races, was allowed to shower and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"It pays to be a winner," an instructor chided the remaining men. "Let's see if 
you are in the proper frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
He blew a whistle and the rest of Class 172 dropped to their bellies. As he 
walked, they crawled. With no warning, smoke bombs exploded. The men coughed 
and choked. Suddenly the air was filled with smoke; explosions rocked the pit 
and shook the ground. Class 172 began to curse. They crawled beneath a barbed 
wire-lattice, following the instructor into the thick of the explosions. 
</P>
<P>
It lasted three hours. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Class 172 encountered another Hell Week tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Gentlemen, the dreaded crossing of the black pit!" barked one instructor, as 
he stood at the edge of a huge pit filled with sedentary water. One by one, the 
men attempted to cross the pit, holding ropes suspended at the ends. The ropes, 
however, were rocked by the instructors. 
</P>
<P>
The losers were ordered to lie -- belly down -- in the rancid water. Only nine 
men crossed without tumbling. Clint Livermore, 27, was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Class 172 cheered him on. "Yeah, do it for the old guys!" they shouted. 
</P>
<P>
The men were ordered into two opposing teams to knock one another off the 
ropes. For the first time in six days, the men disobeyed. "Teamwork! Teamwork!" 
they shouted, allowing one another to pass on the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors ordered them to the surf. Some men carried others. And they hobbled 
down to the ocean. But as they lined up for more surf torture, the command's 
executive officer Larry Simmons walked up. 
</P>
<P>
Class 172 turned and stood at attention. Their colleagues from the winning boat 
crew arrived in a truck, they were dry and clean. They took their positions in 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"Cowards never started," Cmdr. Simmons said, addressing the line of men. "I've 
got some good news and some bad news. The mission ain't over -- hit the surf!" 
</P>
<P>
Class 172, arm-in-arm, turned and plunged into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you tell me about pain?" Simmons asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We love it! It feels extremely good," Class 172 shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"The mission is over!" Simmons announced. 
</P>
<P>
Class 172 yelled. They raised their fists. Hugging one another, they jammed 
into a huddle. The men cried and dripped with sea water. For Class 172, Hell 
Week was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to say you are a tough bunch of bastards," Simmons told them. "I want

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Fauve Landscape: Issues of Art History and Conservation," a symposium at 
the County Museum of Art on Saturday and Sunday, will address historical issues 
and reveal discoveries about Fauve paintings recently made in the museum's 
conservation laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my strong conviction that it was hardly worthwhile to bring all of 
these paintings from throughout the world to Los Angeles without having the 
opportunity to contribute something of a technical study to the rather limited 
information we've had to date of Fauve painting. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the symposium," said curator Judi Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium, scheduled for Saturday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m., and Sunday, 10 a.m.-2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars and historians scheduled to speak on Saturday include John Elderfield, 
the Museum of Modern Art; Jack Flam, City University of New York; James D. 
Herbert, University of Texas; John Klein, Columbia University; Michael 
Parke-Taylor, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, and Inge-Vibeke 
Raaschou-Nielsen, State Museum of Art, Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a panel of conservators and restorers will join the discussion. 
Participants include Lucy Belloli, Metropolitan Museum of Art; Kristen 
Hoermann, Yale University Art Gallery; Andrea Rothe, J. Paul Getty Museum; 
Joseph Fronek and John Twilley, Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

<TEXT>
<P>
The nine of us who survived for the entire show are all now in our 40s, with 
careers and families. The original Mouseketeers had a lot of social and 
professional reunions in the '80s. We starred in an hourlong 1980 NBC special 
celebrating our 25th anniversary and performed live at Disneyland for two 
months each year from 1980 through 1985. We also appeared on a number of talk 
shows and at charity benefits. 
</P>
<P>
We get together frequently at parties, weddings, even christenings. Annette 
Funicello had her own serial, "Annette," before graduating to beach movies and 
later to peanut butter commercials. Annette then took time off to raise her 
children, who are now in college and high school. She returned to performing in 
the mid-'80s in the Disney Channel film "Lots of Luck" and in the 1987 film 
"Back to the Beach," with singer Frankie Avalon. Frankie and Annette toured the 
country in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
* Tommy Cole is the make-up artist for "Evening Shade," "Wings," "Lassie" and 
"Designing Women." He also worked on such features as "Three Fugitives" and 
"Pretty in Pink." On television, Tom has had four Emmy nominations and won an 
Emmy for the miniseries "Backstairs at the White House." 
</P>
<P>
* A car accident in 1983 made Karen Pendleton a paraplegic, but she went on to 
become an activist for handicapped rights. She returned to college to work on a 
degree in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
* Cubby O'Brien was always partnered with Karen. He has a 20-year-old daughter 
and has continued his drumming on six Academy Award shows and with such 
entertainers as Andy Williams, Bernadette Peters and, recently in Los Angeles, 
Shirley MacLaine. 
</P>
<P>
* Doreen Tracey posed for nude magazine photos in the '70s, then became a 
television producer and currently is a partner in Big Bertha Productions. 
</P>
<P>
* Bobby Burgess danced on "The Mickey Mouse Club" and kept dancing for 21 years 
on "The Lawrence Welk Show." He is still dancing and making appearances with 
his partner, Elaine Niverson. Bobby and his wife, Myron Floren's daughter 
Kristie, have four children. 
</P>
<P>
* Darlene Gillespie was in her own serial, "Corky and White Shadow." She is now 
a surgical nurse and has two children. (Earlier this year, Darlene filed suit 
against Walt Disney Productions in connection with her payment for "The Mickey 
Mouse Club.") 
</P>
<P>
* Sharon Baird now lives in Reno. After three years on Disney Channel shows and 
playing the title role in Sondra Locke's film "Rat Boy," Sharon became the 
dialogue coach on the NBC series "Day by Day." LONNIE BURR

MY TV DINNER WITH MICKEY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: 'THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB' DEBUTED 35 YEARS AGO TODAY. THE AUTHOR, A 
MOUSEKETEER, TALKS ABOUT ITS IMPACT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, President Eisenhower was serving his 
first term, a Cadillac cost less than $3,000 and a new word entered the 
language: Mouseketeers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mickey Mouse Club" premiered Oct. 3, 1955, and immediately enthralled 
millions of children. The ABC hit children's series ran until 1959, was re-ran 
from 1961 to 1965, and gave birth to a second version of "The New Mickey Mouse 
Club" from 1975 to 1977 and from 1983 to 1989 on the Disney Channel. A third 
spinoff of the show is in its third season. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Mouseketeers lasted from the first day of filming to the last: Annette, 
Tommy, Karen, Cubby, Doreen, Bobby, Darlene, Sharon, and me -- Lonnie. There 
were three adults -- Jimmy Dodd, Roy Williams, and Bob Amsberry -- as well as 
39 kids during the original show's four-year life. 
</P>
<P>
The adults have since died, as has Mouseketeer Mike Smith. Sherry Alberoni and 
Cheryl Holdridge were highly identifiable even though they were on the series 
for only two years. Two other alumni went on to star in "The Rifleman" (Johnny 
Crawford) and "My Three Sons" (Don Grady). 
</P>
<P>
Why did a fairly simple kids' TV show capture the imagination of millions of 
children and quite a few adults, become a spontaneous hit and last for 35 years 
in one form or another? 
</P>
<P>
The Mouseketeers and their show appeared at the same time as television was 
also growing up. 
</P>
<P>
Children had been on TV almost from its inception but they were always child 
actors playing roles or kids as audience members (the peanut gallery on "Howdy 
Doody") or interviewees (Art Linkletter's "House Party"). The Mouseketeers 
were, at Walt Disney's insistence, almost all amateurs as opposed to show 
business kids. Only Sharon Baird and I had credits as child actor/dancers and 
managed to sneak by Walt and his producers. So the Mouseketeers were real kids 
growing up with whom other real kids viewing the show could identify. Walt made 
it very clear that everyone who watched the show was a member of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Given the schedule of five 15-minute episodes a week plus cartoon introductions 
and other chores, it is not surprising that some of the Mouseketeers made 
mistakes -- which made us seem very human. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity of the show was a very important factor. The Mouseketeers changed 
their show every day: Monday was "Fun With Music Day," Tuesday "Guest Star 
Day," Wednesday "Anything Can Happen Day," Thursday "Circus Day," and Friday 
"Talent Roundup." 
</P>
<P>
The Mouseketeers' singing and dancing was followed by a children's serial such 
as "Spin and Marty" or "The Hardy Boys." The next segment presented short films 
on children in other countries, wildlife, growing up on a farm or the American 
Indians. Millions of kids learned to spell encyclopedia from a cricket. The 
fourth part of the hour was a Disney cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, some unassuming kids known as the Mouseketeers became the link between 
Walt Disney's characters -- Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Donald Duck -- and real 
kids. There was nothing slick or hip about the Mouseketeers. We were real kids 
who grew up and enjoyed ourselves in front of a nation. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a trick for Disney to put on those five hours a week in 1955. One 
could criticize the production values of the show, the repetitive musical 
numbers and the innocuous dialogue. But kids never seem to care about these 
criticisms: The "Mickey Mouse Club" was a seminal entertainment that 
communicated directly to children. 
</P>
<P>
There were faults in the America of the '50s, and faults with "The Mickey Mouse 
Club." An obvious example would be that although there were two Latinos on the 
Club, blacks only appeared as guests. This was a reflection of the age and 
nearly all TV programming at the time. Naturally, the second version of the 
Mouse Club in the '70s and the third show in the '80s were both fully 
integrated. 
</P>
<P>
In their small way, the Mouseketeers and "The Mickey Mouse Club" symbolize for 
millions a lost American innocence. It is wonderful to be a very tiny part of 
entertainment history that makes people smile when it is recalled.

PACEWITZ CONVICTED OF MURDER IN STABBING OF ANAHEIM GIRL

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Robert Pacewitz, who said he killed a 3-year-old girl because he 
thought she was Satan, was found guilty of first-degree murder this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz, 21, was also found guilty of the attempted murder of his mother and 
assault with a deadly weapon on her boyfriend in a separate incident at their 
Anaheim apartment in March. That stabbing attack occurred just hours before the 
little girl was stabbed to death at her Fullerton home. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated less than a day before reaching its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors return tomorrow to determine whether Pacewitz, a former mental 
patient, was sane at the time of the killing. If he is found insane, he would 
be committed to a state hospital for an indeterminate period. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz called police in the early morning hours of March 3 and said he had 
just killed 3-year-old Marcelline Onick at the Fullerton apartment where she 
lived with her mother and baby brother. Police found the boy crying not far 
from the girl's mutilated body in a bedroom. She had been stabbed 44 times and 
her head nearly severed with a butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
The mother had left the children in the care of the baby boy's father, but he 
turned those duties over to a friend whom Pacewitz had gone to see after he 
stabbed his mother. Pacewitz, a friend of the children's mother, Joanne 
Boydston, ended up the lone baby-sitter for them. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown contends that Pacewitz killed the little girl 
to get back at his own mother, who considered the girl like a granddaughter. 
Pacewitz was upset with his mother, Elena Fontaine, because he claimed she had 
failed to assist him when he told her he needed emotional help. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz claimed to his doctors after his arrest that he thought his mother was 
Satan and was trying to kill him and that he thought Satan had taken over the 
little girl's body. But prosecutor Brown claims Pacewitz concocted the Satan 
story.

SUSPECT CRASHES IN N. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robbery suspect was arrested this morning after a car chase ended with his 
crashing into a fire hydrant and a light pole in North Hollywood, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Raymond Rueda said the suspect, Yoon Hong, 18, of Rialto, suffered 
only minor injuries in the 1:15 a.m. crash at Vineland Avenue and Bluffside 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being held in lieu of $20,000 
bail. There were no other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident began about 1 a.m. near Silver Lake and Sunset 
boulevards in Silver Lake when officers on routine patrol came upon a street 
robbery in progress. 
</P>
<P>
The officers saw three young men robbing a fourth man, and the suspects 
scattered and ran in different directions when they saw the police car, Rueda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects ran to a car and sped north on the Hollywood Freeway with 
the patrol car in pursuit. The vehicle left the freeway at Vineland Avenue, and 
the driver turned the vehicle's headlights off, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
At Bluffside Drive, the car went out of control and struck the fire hydrant and 
light pole and came to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
Hong was treated at the scene by paramedics and was being held at the Northeast 
Station. Police were still looking for the two other suspects. The name of the 
robbery victim was not released.

STORE OWNER GUILTY IN SALE OF RAP ALBUM

<P>
A record store owner today was found guilty of obscenity for selling a record 
by the rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated less than three hours before convicting Charles Freeman on a 
misdemeanor obscenity charge. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by undercover Broward County sheriff's deputies June 8 for 
selling the Miami rap group's album "As Nasty As They Wanna Be" in his E-C 
Records store. 
</P>
<P>
The case went to the jury of five women and one man after final arguments this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman could get a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Sentencing was set for Nov. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't represent my community where E-C Records is!" Freeman, who is 
black, shouted as he left the courthouse. "It's unfair. The jury was all white. 
They don't know where E-C Records is. They don't know a goddamned thing about 
the ghetto!" 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended the album exceeds the limits of community standards and 
free speech with explicit and sometimes violent references to sex. Freeman was 
arrested two days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled the lyrics were 
obscene. 
</P>
<P>
But in his closing argument, defense attorney Bruce Rogow told the jury that 
"one person's vulgarity is another person's art" and argued that the jury could 
not convict Freeman if they found any artistic merit in the group's album.

ROYAL TRAGEDY IN MONACO;

<P>
HUSBAND OF CAROLINE DIES IN BOAT CRASH

MONTE CARLO, Monaco 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tragedy revisited Monaco's royal family today as Stefano Casiraghi, the 
30-year-old husband of Princess Caroline, was killed when his speedboat flipped 
while he was defending his title in a world championship race, the Royal Palace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline, 33, was in Paris when she learned of the death of her Italian 
financier husband. She quickly left for Monaco, wearing black mourning clothes. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second tragedy to strike the Grimaldi family in eight years -- 
Caroline's mother, Princess Grace, died after a car crash in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Casiraghi and co-pilot Patrice Innocenti drove their catamaran, 
the Pinot di Pinot, straight into a wave at 93 m.p.h. during a morning run for 
the World Offshore Championships. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-foot boat flipped, ejecting Innocenti. But witnesses said Casiraghi 
remained strapped to his seat and bore the full impact of the vessel slamming 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
The two-engine, five-ton boat sank with Casiraghi aboard, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"He surely didn't have time to look out and, at that speed, stuck under the 
boat, must have been killed by the blow," said another competitor, Michel 
Karsten. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews pulled both men from the water and rushed them to Princess 
Grace Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital said Innocenti was being treated for his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Today's accident is the worst blow to Monaco's ruling family since Princess 
Grace, the American actress who gave up Hollywood to marry Prince Rainier III, 
died in 1982. Caroline's younger sister, Princess Stephanie, also was injured 
in the car crash. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline married Casiraghi in a civil ceremony Dec. 29, 1983, under a portrait 
of her mother. The marriage followed an unhappy two-year union with French 
playboy Philippe Junot. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had three children: sons Andrea, 6, and Pierre, 3, and daughter 
Charlotte, 4. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline married Casiraghi after divorcing Junot but without obtaining a Roman 
Catholic Church annulment of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
She said she married again because she was in love and knew an annulment -- 
first sought in 1981 -- would take a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a real home and children," she was quoted as saying. "It was 
difficult for my conscience, but I was overwhelmed by the desire to have 
children. Surely that can be understood from a Christian point of view." 
</P>
<P>
The Grimaldi family has ruled Monaco since the 13th Century.

Jermund Skogstad took a break from moving into his new apartment, went out for 
a bite to eat and forgot to take his new address with him. 
</P>
<P>
That was a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is embarrassing . . . but I can't find the way back to my new home," the 
50-year-old man told the Aftenposten newspaper. "I've searched and searched." 
</P>
<P>
Skogstad went to the newspaper in hopes his landlady would read of his plight 
and call him. The story and his picture ran Tuesday, but there had been no call 
by today. 
</P>
<P>
Skogstad moved to the capital from the countryside and lost his way while 
walking to a cafe. His wallet, with the address, was in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
His search has been expensive: He paid rent for the 30 minutes he spent in his 
apartment and also had to rent a hotel room.

migrant farm worker to steal his expensive watch and two rings, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"They did it for the sheer joy of doing it. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of random violence is frightening," Police Chief Lane Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a 20-year-old believed to be from Mexico, was listed in stable 
condition at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The victim told police he and his cousin were at a grocery store Friday in this 
Yakima suburb and were approached by two men who offered to sell them a chain 
saw. One of the men pulled a gun, and the two victims were forced into their 
own car and driven to a remote area, where the holdup men tried to remove the 
victim's jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The man's watch, valued at $1,500, had a special security latch that was 
difficult to open. The victim tried to show the robbers how to remove the 
watch, but they apparently "saw this as resistance and took the most expedient 
method to get to it," Roberts said.

Lefties are by far in a minority even before they are born, a study of 
thumb-sucking by fetuses suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers using ultrasound examinations found that only 12 of 224 fetuses 
preferred to suck their left thumb. The 212 others favored their right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that the position of the fetus did not affect thumb preference. 
Repeated observations of 17 fetuses found that preference for a particular 
thumb continued through pregnancy, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, from Queen's University of Belfast in Northern Ireland, 
reported their findings in a letter to the editor in Thursday's issue of the 
British journal Nature.

AUSTRALIA: FIRM'S STOCK TUMBLES 40% IN A MONTH AMID CONCERN OVER ITS MASSIVE 
$8.7-BILLION DEBT.

Rupert Murdoch's debt-laden News Corp. said today it will merge its four Sydney 
and Melbourne newspapers into two 24-hour publications to avoid shutting down 
its struggling afternoon dailies. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the move, effective Monday, will likely ease pressure on 
News Corp., whose stock price has tumbled about 40% in the last month on 
investor concern about its massive $8.7-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
The merger of Australia's best-selling newspaper, the Melbourne Sun, with the 
city's struggling afternoon broadsheet the Herald, and Sydney's tabloids, the 
morning Daily Telegraph and ailing afternoon Daily Mirror, will mean the loss 
of about 180 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"As an alternative to closing either (afternoon) paper, it will save well over 
800, probably 1,000 jobs as well as giving the public continuing afternoon 
newspaper service," Murdoch said at a news conference in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect the savings to be quite considerable," he said. "I think it is a 
business benefit in that it should improve the overall profit of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch declined to comment either about the recent plunge in News Corp.'s 
stock price, which has wiped about $515 million off its market value, or a 
sharp rise in the group's short-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch said the changes are linked with News' $830-million investment in 
high-technology color printing plants in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and 
Adelaide. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, now an American citizen who spends little time in his native 
Australia, is on an extended visit that will include the company's Oct. 23 
annual meeting in Adelaide. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he welcomes the merger. "It will probably mean a 
loss of jobs for some people, but as far as the community in general is 
concerned, they probably will get a better service," he told reporters in 
Canberra. 
</P>
<P>
The merger of the Melbourne Sun and the Herald will create the Herald-Sun with 
circulation estimated to reach 600,000, he said. Currently, the Herald sells 
175,634 copies a day and the morning Sun 560,444.

rise in overall passenger traffic in August but called the growth "profitless." 
</P>
<P>
The rise kept pace with traffic growth over the last year, the AEA said, adding 
that the Persian Gulf crisis, higher fuel prices and other cost increases "have 
seriously eroded already thin (profit) margins." The AEA said fuel costs had 
been rising before the gulf crisis began and had not been offset by the 
relative weakness of the dollar.

BRETT SINGLES, NEAR 3RD BATTING TITLE AT .329

Kansas City's George Brett singled in his only official at-bat to close in on 
his third career batting title, but Cleveland's Sergio Valdez won for the 
fourth time in five decisions as the Indians beat the Royals 5-2 today at 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Cincinnati, Ken Caminiti tripled home the winning run in the top 
of the ninth inning as the Houston Astros beat the Reds 3-2 to leave Cincinnati 
with a losing second-half record. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals finished 75-86 and in sixth place in the American League West, the 
second worst showing in their 22-year history. The Indians clinched fourth 
place in the AL East, matching their best finish since they were third in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, trying to become the first player to win batting titles in three 
decades, was inserted as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning and hit a sacrifice 
fly. He singled in his next at-bat to improve his batting average one point to 
.329. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Rickey Henderson began the day at .325 and needed to go at least 
3-for-3 or 4-for-5 to overtake Brett. Henderson and the A's host California 
later today. 
</P>
<P>
Brett also won batting titles in 1976 at .333 and in 1980 at .390. At age 37, 
he would be the third-oldest player to win a batting championship, behind Ted 
Williams (40 in 1958) and Honus Wagner (37 in 1911). 
</P>
<P>
Brett drove in Kansas City's first run with a sacrifice fly in the fifth after 
Royals Manager John Wathan created an excellent situation for him. Russ Morman 
started the inning with a double, and Wathan, following a pregame promise, had 
Jeff Schulz bunt him to third to make Brett's at-bat less risky. Brett's 
routine fly to center off Valdez scored Morman. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Brett lined a single to right off reliever Mauro Gozzo. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds finished the season at 91-71 overall but were 41-42 since the All-Star 
break and 58-59 since June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Davis led off the ninth with a walk off Tim Birtsas (1-3), and 
pinch-runner Gerald Young came around when Caminiti tripled off the wall in 
center for his second RBI of the game. Dave Smith (6-6) got the last four outs. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Frank Viola became the 18th pitcher in history to win 20 games in 
each league as the New York Mets ended the season with a 6-3 victory over the 
Pirates in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Viola had lost three previous attempts at his 20th. He worked seven innings, 
allowing seven hits, striking out five and walking two. Alejandro Pena pitched 
the final inning for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
In Montreal, Spike Owen and Nelson Santovenia hit run-scoring triples to 
highlight a seven-run seventh inning as the Expos handed the St. Louis 
Cardinals their seventh straight loss, 9-2.

GOODEN GIVES METS A DEADLINE: SIGN HIM BY START OF SPRING

New York Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden will become a free agent after next season 
if the team doesn't sign him to a long-term contract extension before he 
reports to spring training, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden wants to avoid the contract uncertainties that teammate Darryl 
Strawberry has gone through this season, New York Newsday reported in today's 
editions. Strawberry, whose contract expires at the end of this season, has 
said he plans to file for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go through what Straw went through," Gooden told Newsday. "I 
don't think that's good for a player. I don't want to have to go out there 
every start thinking I have to have a good start because if I don't it'll cost 
me money. I don't want to be bothered with it in spring training, either." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, who signed a three-year, $6.7-million contract after the 1988 season, 
said it's up to the Mets to make the first move. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's up to me," Gooden said. "I understand they wanted to see if 
I was healthy this year and could pitch like I did before. Well, I think I've 
showed them that. I would think that they would want to sign me. But I'm not 
going to ask." 
</P>
<P>
Mets General Manager Frank Cashen said the team has not decided how to handle 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have a game plan?" Cashen said. "The answer is no. We haven't ruled it 
in or out. There are many things you have to consider. Long-term contracts 
rarely work out, maybe one in 10 or so. What do you do with everybody else who 
is one year away? Do you sign them? Do you trade them? These are things you 
have to think about." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, who finished the season with a 19-7 record after a 9-4 loss to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night, is 119-45 in seven seasons with the Mets.

South Korea fought its way to five boxing titles and one in wrestling today, 
moving into second place behind China and ahead of Japan in the Asian Games 
gold medal race. 
</P>
<P>
While South Korea's haul fell well short of its sweep of all 12 boxing golds in 
the 1986 Games, it boosted the country's total to 42 golds, ahead of Japan's 
37. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea also had one gold in track, but suffered a blow in soccer, losing 
its semifinal match to Iran 1-0. North Korea advanced to the soccer final by 
blanking Thailand 1-0 in a game marked by several scuffles. 
</P>
<P>
Iran, meanwhile, won three wrestling golds, its first golds in these Games. 
</P>
<P>
China boosted its gold medal total to 155 by adding 10 -- seven in track and 
field, one in women's epee team fencing, one in the Chinese martial art of 
wushu and one in boxing -- a sport it had banned for 28 years. The Chinese had 
six boxers in the finals, to South Korea's seven. 
</P>
<P>
In total medals, China led with 294, to 154 for Japan, 152 for South Korea and 
68 for North Korea, which had 12 golds. 
</P>
<P>
In the most exciting race on the track, Qatari runner Mohammed Sulaiman shot 
from behind in the last 15 meters to win his second Asian Games gold medal -- 
by one-hundredth of a second in a 5,000-meter race.

U.S. TO FACE MEXICO IN '91 DAVIS CUP OPENING ROUND

The United States, which faces Australia in the final of this year's Davis Cup 
in late November, will begin its 1991 Davis Cup play against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, which defeated Mexico in the first round this year to run its 
record to 26-3 against that nation, will travel to Mexico for the competition 
Feb. 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, which needed victories in Prague and Vienna to reach the final 
of this year's competition, could advance to the 1991 final without leaving 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
Today's draw determined that U.S.-Mexico winner will face either Spain or 
Canada in the second round on March 29-31. The United States would host Spain, 
while Canada would be the host team in the second round if it wins in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, which has an 0-2 record against the United States, hosted the last 
meeting between the nations in 1972 in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Australia, whose 26 Davis Cup titles is second only to the 28 of the United 
States, will host Belgium in the first round next year. Belgium, like Canada, 
will be making its debut in the World Group of the annual men's tennis 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Jorgensen, chairman of the Davis Cup committee for the International 
Tennis Federation and a former head of the U.S. Tennis Assn., said the 
Americans will be ready for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some clay-court players now, so we should have a good chance against 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials managed to avoid a politically embarrassing matchup as they conducted 
the draw of 88 nations by picking pieces of paper out of the silver Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Kuwait were assigned to different halves of the draw in the 
AsiaOceania Zone Group II, but the Iraqis still could have been chosen to play 
Saudi Arabia or Syria, two countries whose troops are facing off against the 
Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Iraq was drawn to play its first-round series at Jordan, which has 
steered a middle course in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

MARLENE DIETRICH WELCOMES GERMAN REUNIFICATION

Lendary screen star Marlene Dietrich broke a self-imposed silence today to 
welcome the unification of the Germany she has not seen for 30 years, saying 
blood was thicker than water. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from her Paris retreat, Dietrich, 88, said: "Of course 
I'm happy. 
</P>
<P>
Anything that brings people together and encourages peace always makes me 
happy. Happiness is so rare in this troubled world." 
</P>
<P>
Dietrich starred on the Berlin stage in the 1920s but emigrated to the United 
States in 1930 before the rise of Nazism to begin a glittering Hollywood 
career. 
</P>
<P>
At that time she said she wanted nothing more to do with her native country, 
and she refused to say if she now planned a return to the newly unified 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot and do not want to answer that question," she told a reporter from 
the Paris daily France-Soir. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take some time for people to get used to each other again, but their 
inner power will overcome. As the old saying goes, 'Blood is thicker than 
water,' " said Dietrich, who last visited Germany in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Dietrich, famed for her husky voice, high cheekbones and legs insured by Lloyds 
of London, reached Hollywood stardom in 1930's steamy "The Blue Angel." Her 
other major movies include "Morocco," "Destry Rides Again," "Touch of Evil" and 
"Judgment at Nuremberg."

MEL GIBSON TAKES NEW ROLE: REAL LIFE

Mel Gibson, the star of a string of blockbuster movies and one of Hollywood's 
top box-office draws, is going home to Australia "to lead my own life instead 
of someone else's." 
</P>
<P>
The star of the "Lethal Weapon" and "Road Warrior" series says he is so tired 
after years of nonstop work that he is incapable of making another movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take off 10 months or a year, if for no other reason than people 
must be getting sick of the sight of me," he told Reuters in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"But seriously," he added, "it's just doing all these films. My state of mind 
says that I never want to do anything again, but I'm sure after a year off I'll 
feel like it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the workload. I think if I had to make one more film, I couldn't do 
it. Not right now. Not for about a year or so. I'm just too tired. I just want 
to go home." 
</P>
<P>
Asked where home was, the 34-year-old actor smiled ruefully and said, "I wish 
someone would tell me." 
</P>
<P>
Home for much of this year has been Scotland, where he filmed Shakespeare's 
classic "Hamlet," which Gibson called "the hardest damned thing I've ever 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, home was Thailand, where he spent several months shooting "Air 
America," his current release about the CIA's secret air force and its 
operations in Laos during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Home in real life is a sprawling cattle ranch in the Australian state of 
Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not myself here," he explained as he sipped black coffee in a luxury hotel 
in Los Angeles' fashionable Westwood section. "You're not seeing the real me." 
</P>
<P>
The real Gibson, he explained, likes nothing more than romping on the floor 
with his six children or spending his days working with cattle and studying the 
genetics of the bovine animals.

Tony Award-winning actress Lauren Bacall says the theater is still her first 
love, but Broadway just isn't the same anymore and she'd rather work in smaller 
venues outside New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bacall complained during a talk at Town Hall here Monday that Broadway's 
emphasis on reviving old hits in recent years has limited opportunities for 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of revivals. I would rather be on stage in Chicago or in a good 
repertory theater in Seattle than be doing some of the things available on 
Broadway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bacall, who won Tonys for "Applause" and "Woman of the Year," credited her late 
husband Humphrey Bogart for her success. He starred opposite her in her first 
movie, "To Have and Have Not," in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
"Bogie was the best teacher I had," she said. "He showed me the ropes. Until I 
met him, I believed everything I read."

IRVINE CO., LAGUNA STRIKE TENTATIVE DEAL FOR CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY WOULD GET 2,150 ACRES FOR $78 MILLION THAT WOULD BE PAID 
OVER FIVE YEARS.

<TEXT>
<P>
After days of intense negotiations, the Irvine Co. informally agreed Tuesday to 
sell 2,150 acres of Laguna Canyon land to the city for $78 million over a 
five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
However, the "agreement in principle" reached between the developer, 
environmentalists and city negotiators needs to be studied by City Council 
members before they give their final approval, officials said. The boards of 
other organizations involved in the negotiations must also approve the 
agreement before it is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
But the tentative agreement signals an end to a long period of discord between 
the company and Laguna Beach residents who were opposed to the 3,200-unit 
Laguna Laurel development project. Environmentalists had vowed to stand in 
front of bulldozers before abandoning their hopes of keeping the pristine land 
as open space. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the company has been very generous in basically gifting $80 million to 
realize a $78-million purchase price," Irvine Co. Senior Vice President Gary 
Hunt said after the tentative agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Although the land was independently appraised at $105 million, the Irvine Co. 
added to the valuation $30.5 million that it said would be needed to meet the 
terms of a development agreement with the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of the agreement, the company will drop the price from 
$105 million to $78 million, assume the $30.5 million in required 
infrastructure improvements and agree to forgo $22.8 million in interest 
payments that would normally be assessed over the five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Following the council's closed-door session to consider the latest offer, 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry stopped short of saying they had an agreement but 
said they were very close. He thanked the Irvine Co. for making concessions on 
the proposed purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the movement of the Irvine Co. The council is seriously 
considering this plan, and we hope to have a final approved plan put together 
this week," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's negotiating session was hurriedly called after informal proposals 
were exchanged in recent days between the Irvine Co. and Paul Freeman, the 
go-between who was hired by both sides to help negotiate the land purchase 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed purchase price was also a compromise for the city, which last 
offered $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gentry hedged on whether an agreement had been reached, Freeman said 
he was optimistic the council would give its approval because it has scheduled 
a special session to discuss the latest offer for later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly represents a fair and balanced plan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for the city to pay $33 million by June 30 of next year. 
That payment would buy 90% of the land, including most of the environmentally 
sensitive property on the west side of Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The next three years include payments of $3 million, $4 million, and $5 
million, respectively, with $33 million due the final year. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the agreement is an option for the city to purchase other parcels not 
included in the Laguna Laurel development plan. The city would be required to 
exercise that option within five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot for a little in the first year, and we have five years to pursue 
other funding sources," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the city's first-year payment would come from a $20-million bond issue 
that Laguna Beach voters will be asked to approve on the Nov. 6 ballot. The 
county has also promised $10 million over five years, and the city is looking 
to state grants and private fund raising to help meet the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are under pressure to wrap up the land negotiations this week in 
order to give city residents enough time to study the proposed agreement before 
voting on the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA LAUREL: A TENTATIVE DEAL 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s proposal calls for the Laguna Beach to pay $33 million by June 
30, 1991. That payment would buy 90% of the land, including most of the 
environmentally sensitive property on the west side of Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The next three years include payments of $3 million, $4 million, and $5 
million, respectively, with $33 million due the final year. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the agreement is an option for the city to buy other parcels not 
included in the Laguna Laurel development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the city's first-year payment would come from a $20-million bond issue 
that Laguna Beach voters will be asked to approve Nov. 6. The county has also 
promised $10 million over five years, and the city is looking to state grants 
and private fund raising to help meet the payments.

ROADBLOCK? Riverside County may go to court to block toll lanes on the 91 
Freeway in Orange County. . . . Noting that Riverside County residents pay a 
local half-cent sales tax for freeway improvements, Riverside's transportation 
chief pledged in a letter last week to Caltrans to "exhaust all administrative 
and legal avenues" to kill the toll plan. "The question is the equity of paying 
a toll when most of those using Highway 91 are from San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties, and they have already agreed to pay tax money," Kay 
Ceniceros says. "It is double taxation and ought not to be done." Dallas

IRVINE TEACHER IN KEY AIDS CASE DIES AT 45; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: VINCENT CHALK'S LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COUNTY EDUCATION DEPARTMENT 
BROUGHT A LANDMARK RULING PROTECTING THE JOB SECURITY OF PATIENTS IN GOVERNMENT 
JOBS.

Vincent Chalk, the Irvine teacher who mde national headlines when he won the 
right to stay at the helm of his classroom while suffering from AIDS, died 
Tuesday. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk died at St. Mary Medical Center about 5 a.m., said his friend and 
attorney, Marjorie Rushforth. He was admitted to the hospital Thursday and 
lapsed into a coma Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk's lawsuit against the Orange County Department of Education resulted in a 
landmark ruling protecting the job security of AIDS patients in government 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Vincent settled for every person with AIDS who had a federally related 
paycheck their right to maintain their employment in spite of an AIDS 
diagnosis," said Rushforth, who represented Chalk. "It's important because it's 
irreparable injury to put someone out of their job at a time when they need the 
community support their co-workers give them, the satisfaction of performing 
useful work in the world, the identity we all derive from our employment, not 
to mention the insurance benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Jemison-Smith, chairwoman of the Orange County HIV Advisory Committee, 
said she was "drawn to Vincent for his courage." 
</P>
<P>
"He did for schoolteachers with AIDS what Ryan White did for students with 
AIDS," she said, referring to the Indiana youngster who waged a successful 
battle against AIDS discrimination in public schools. Ryan died of the disease 
on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Peterson, the county's school superintendent, made the decision to 
remove Chalk from his teaching post. Reflecting on that decision Monday, he 
said he was concerned not only about protecting students from exposure to the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus (HIV), but about insulating Chalk 
from any illnesses students might be carrying. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up being the unlucky pioneers," he said. "We brought about some good 
guidance from the court and ended up getting good information about how the 
disease is spread." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk became a celebrity only reluctantly, prevailing in a wearisome court 
battle against the County Education Department, which had removed him from the 
classroom and given him an office job writing grant proposals in August, 1987. 
Education officials said they could not risk exposing Chalk to his students 
because they were not certain how AIDS was transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk, a homosexual, contracted pneumonia in February, 1987. Further medical 
tests revealed that he had AIDS, and he reported his illness to his 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Prendergast, chief of the Orange County Health Care Agency's disease 
control unit, said Chalk posed no health threat to students or others, but 
education officials took him out of the classroom anyway, beginning an intense 
spate of litigation that ultimately broke new ground for those with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Chalk sought to remain anonymous but reluctantly revealed his name in 
an emotional press conference after filing suit to reclaim his job. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk, who taught hearing-impaired students at Venado Middle School and 
University High School in Irvine, was transformed overnight into a cause 
celebre for disabled people fighting for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't feel this is a gay issue," Chalk said early in his court 
battle. "It's really a human rights issue." 
</P>
<P>
The county had by then removed him from the classroom, barred him from the 
campus grounds and forbidden him to contact his students. 
</P>
<P>
"The attack on my spirit has been devastating," Chalk wrote in a court 
declaration. "I feel I have been dealt an unqualified injustice by the decision 
to remove me not only from my chosen livelihood but also from the support of my 
loving students and co-workers who made my job, and my life, complete." 
</P>

In the fall of 1987, a Los Angeles federal judge refused to let Chalk return to 
his class. But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in November of that 
year that schools could not bar Chalk from teaching. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to his post. In May, 1988, Chalk agreed to accept $35,000 from the 
education department to settle his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark decision, the appeals court held that AIDS should be considered a 
disability under federal law and that people with AIDS who hold government jobs 
should be entitled to protection from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Reared in the tiny town of Lewis, Kan., Chalk learned resilience early. He was 
reared a Mormon, and as a youngster had to resist the temptations and teasing 
of his classmates. They would tease him about his religion, Chalk remembered in 
a 1989 interview, and press him to smoke or drink. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easier to do it, but it was something we didn't do," Chalk 
said. "My mother taught me the values of standing up for what I believe." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk taught at University High until January, when he cut down to part-time 
work, Rushforth said. Repeated bouts with various opportunistic infections 
forced him to quit altogether in June, but he remained optimistic about his 
recovery and even signed up to be a substitute teacher for this academic year, 
Rushforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk received his bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in 1968. He 
earned his master's degree in special education and communication from Cal 
State Northridge and began teaching in 1971. He began teaching in Orange County 
schools in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk is survived by his parents, two sisters and his life partner, John 
Woesner. A memorial service will be held Thursday at 5 p.m. at 
Stricklin/Snively Mortuary in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, Chalk's family is requesting that donations be made to 
Project Ahead, Padua House or Being Alive, all in Long Beach.

DMV SNAFU RESULTS IN REGISTRATION RENEWAL BILLS UP TO $2,500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When Dixon Gayer's wife bought him his $40,000 Lexus sedan last year, she 
toldhim he should feel like royalty. But when he got his first registration 
renewal bill from the Department of Motor Vehicles for $1,710 this week, he 
said he felt more like a pauper. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the bill and knew there had to be some sort of mistake. I was 
definitely not counting on paying that much," said the retired Cal State Long 
Beach journalism professor from his Huntington Beach home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gayer, who thought he was supposed to pay $658 for the first year, was not 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Because a Sacramento computer operator incorrectly programmed a new fee 
schedule for a rare antique car, the DMV has made its most widespread billing 
snafu in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
DMV officials said that about 330,000 Californians were mailed erroneous bills 
during the past week, some of which reflected renewal charges of up to $2,500 
for Volkswagen bugs, Ford Pintos and other modest means of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had (computer and billing) problems before," DMV spokesman Bill Gengler 
said, "but nothing of this magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
But if you have received a registration renewal bill that literally takes your 
breath away, DMV officials said, don't worry. The computer system is fixed and 
car owners with bollixed bills will get corrected ones soon. 
</P>
<P>
The problem began last Monday, when a computer operator was attempting to 
revise the fee schedule for the five 1920 Rolls-Royces registered in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he accidentally changed the programming for all cars with 
renewal dates of Nov. 16, 18 and 20. As a result, bills to 421,000 people 
throughout the state were printed out wrong, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to put the skids on what seemed a disastrous episode in the 
making, DMV officials on Friday caught as many as 91,000 bills before they were 
mailed. But about 330,000 were mailed before the error was caught, Gengler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Of those mailed, about 41,000 were too high, Gengler said. The remainder of the 
bills undercharged for registration renewals. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have already paid will either get a refund or will be billed for the 
balance. Gengler said he doubts that many people have actually written a check 
for the bill, however, making the problem less complicated than if DMV had 
caught the problem later. 
</P>
<P>
"Who goes out and pays their registration on the day they get the bill?" 
Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said that those with erroneous bills should not contact their local DMV 
branch office but instead should wait for a corrected bill to arrive in the 
mail within the next few days. The bills will contain letters directing owners 
to discard the previous bill. 
</P>
<P>
DMV officials also said that when the corrected bills come, they should not be 
taken to a local branch but should be mailed directly to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Until everyone receives new bills, however, DMV officials expect to continue 
hearing from confused car owners wondering why they were billed $2,000 for an 
economical Hyundai or $15 for a Porsche 911 Targa. 
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be no rhyme or reason for the way people were charged," said 
Dorothy Dale, office manager for the DMV's Westminster branch. 
</P>
<P>
Dale said that on Friday she went to lunch with no clue to the impending 
barrage of phone calls that she was to begin receiving later that day. 
</P>
<P>
When she came back from lunch, she noticed a $1,096 bill from a car owner who 
was expecting to pay about $200 sitting on her desk. "I wondered, 'What is this 
for?' " she said. "I found out soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m., office workers began fielding the first of what would be more than 
150 calls to the Westminster branch. A short time later, she said, a couple 
came in to complain about a $2,089 bill for a 10-year-old car. The bill should 
have been $54. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion, people seemed cooperative, Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been very, very nice about it," she said. "The majority of us all 
know what it is like working on a computer, with all the snafus that occur." 
</P>
<P>
Antique car dealer Dennis Mitosinka said the 1920 Rolls-Royces that set off the 
bureaucratic snafu are extremely rare and worth up to $1.5 million. Three of 
the vintage automobiles are in Southern California and two are owned by Bay 
Area residents. 
</P>
<P>
Mitosinka, who said he deals with the DMV on an almost daily basis and was 
amused to hear about the billing problem, was not surprised about the error. 
</P>
<P>
"They screw up more stuff," he said. "It's a government agency. What can you 
expect?"

RAIDS SEIZE 5 IN BRUTAL BEATING BY BIKE THIEVES; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: AN ANAHEIM FATHER TRYING TO RECOVER HIS SON'S PROPERTY WAS VICIOUSLY 
ATTACKED BY A PACK OF GANG TOUGHS. MORE THAN 50 OUTRAGED POLICE BRING SUSPECTS 
IN.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In early morning raids Tuesday, police arrested five alleged gang members 
suspected of brutally beating a man who tried to retrieve his son's stolen 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 police converged on seven houses at 6:30 a.m. and confiscated 
baseball bats and clubs believed to have been used in the assault. Also seized 
were loaded firearms, clothing possibly stained with blood and a bicycle that 
matched the description of the one stolen from the victim's 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Jose I. Perez-Reveles, 39, of Anaheim was attacked Sept. 24 near George 
Washington Community Center by a group of eight to 10 people wielding baseball 
bats, clubs and metal pipes. One of his attackers was armed with a handgun, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said many officers are especially motivated to 
solve this case because of the circumstances of the attack on Perez-Reveles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was complaining about getting up early to do this (raid)," Hedgpeth 
said. "This was a brutal beating. (Perez-Reveles) didn't do anything. . . . He 
is a true victim." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from his hospital bed, Perez-Reveles said he was happy that 
some of his alleged assailants had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe there are people out there that would do things like this," he 
said through an interpreter. "These type of people are not a benefit to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the attack, Perez-Reveles said, he was only trying "to find out 
for myself that my son's bike was stolen. . . . It was his pride and joy. He 
rode it to school." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim man said his son, Jorge, would always buy new parts for his blue 
beach cruiser and took great care of it. "I told him not to buy any good things 
for the bike because the cholos (gang members) would see them and be tempted to 
do something to you." 
</P>
<P>
After his son told him that a gang member had slapped his face and took his 
bicycle, Perez-Reveles said, he and his brother-in-law drove over to the park 
to find the bike. 
</P>
<P>
Upon getting out of his car, Perez-Reveles said, he was confronted by eight to 
10 gang members, one of whom said he was the "jefe," or chief of the gang. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Perez and his brother-in-law tried to run away, he said. After 
three or four blocks however, Perez-Reveles was caught. The "jefe" then hit him 
in the face with a metal pipe, Perez-Reveles said. The force of the blow ripped 
open his face and knocked him to the ground. When he tried to get back on his 
feet he was struck on his back, he said. After that, he remained on the ground 
and was repeatedly struck. 
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they found him battered and bloody, laying in the middle 
of the street. His 1968 Chevrolet Malibu had also been smashed by clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Perez-Reveles was taken to a nearby hospital with multiple injuries, including 
a broken nose and thumb, a punctured lung, a lacerated right eye and numerous 
cuts and bruises. Doctors are unsure if he will regain his normal vision. 
</P>
<P>
"He was hit so hard that officers could see into his sinus cavity and behind 
his eye," Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have requested that the hospital not be identified, fearing a possible 
gang retaliation. Perez-Reveles, the father of four who works as a produce 
packager in Orange, also worries about being attacked again. Nonetheless, he 
agreed to have his picture taken to "show everyone things like this happen." 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Juan Carlos Suarez, 19, on suspicion of attempted murder; Leonard 
Suarez, 20, for a probation violation, and Victor Moraza, 20, for brandishing a 
firearm. Two juveniles, ages 16 and 17, were also arrested but their names were 
not released. They were held on probation violation and suspicion of armed 
robbery charges, respectively. All of the suspects are from Anaheim and all are 
in custody.

DISTRICT, TEACHERS UNION ON SAME SIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
Parents who attended back-to-school night last year were more likely to find 
angry teachers carrying picket signs than information about the coming school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, both sides are ushering in what they hope is a new era of 
cooperation, with a joint project by the teachers' union and school district 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the Capistrano Unified Education Assn. split the cost of 
printing more than 15,000 copies of "Parent Power," a pamphlet written under 
the auspices of the National Education Assn., which represents teachers' unions 
on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two weeks, the six-page publication will be distributed at 
back-to-school nights throughout the district, at sites including Dana Hills 
High School, where teachers staged a large demonstration last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The leaflet contains reading, writing and math activities for parents to do at 
home with elementary children and topics to discuss with older students. The 
booklet also includes a school calendar, phone numbers for each school in the 
district and the number for union headquarters in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be the first time the teachers' association and the district have ever 
worked together on such a project," said union president Ric Stephenson, whose 
signature appears alongside that of Supt. Jerome Thornsley on the pamphlet's 
cover letter.CHERYLANNE BEALER

LEAGUE BACKS CITY ON SEATING OF GAIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The League of California Cities has supported Irvine's contention that it is 
not legally obliged to seat Mary Ann Gaido on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the state Court of Appeal, the league opposed a court order in 
Gaido's favor. The letter supports Irvine's contention that Superior Court 
Judge Eileen C. Moore should not have applied the state elections code Aug. 31 
when she ruled that Gaido was entitled to an open seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Since Irvine has adopted its own charter of laws, the city laws should spell 
out election procedures, not the state laws, Irvine argued in its appeal. An 
appellate court hearing is scheduled Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
In a meetingWednesday, the league's Legal Advocacy Committee voted to support 
Irvine's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an extremely important legal issue," said JoAnne Speers, the league's 
legal counsel. "It relates to charter city powers, and central to the notion of 
what a charter city power includes is this issue of control over elections," 
Speers said. "The state Constitution specifically gives charter cities the 
right to govern their own elections." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-four of the state's 457 cities, including Irvine, have adopted charters 
to govern themselves. The remaining cities are governed by general state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Superior Court ruling sets no legal precedent, it erodes 
law-making power granted to charter cities, City Atty. John L. Fellows said. He 
had asked the league to file a "friend of the court" brief in support of 
Irvine's case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's charter spells out how openings on the City Council should be filled 
when a council member is elected mayor. In the June 5 election, Councilwoman 
Sally Anne Sheridan was elected mayor, leaving her seat open. 
</P>
<P>
The charter says the runner-up in the City Council election fills the opening. 
But a provision allows residents to collect signatures from 7% of the city's 
registered voters calling for a special election to fill the seat. Residents 
gathered the signatures, prompting Gaido, the runner-up, to file suit. She 
alleged that their petition was misleading because it didn't specify that an 
election wasn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
Moore ruled in Gaido's favor and ordered her seated. 
</P>
<P>
But Fellows, in the city's appeal, said that Moore used laws in her ruling that 
don't apply to charter cities. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Fellows also submitted newspaper clippings to the Court of Appeal, 
intending to show that Irvine residents weren't misled by the petitions.TOM

POLICE GROUP CALLS PROP. 134 MISLEADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY CHABOT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Council of Police and Sheriffs on Tuesday denounced the 
nickel-a-drink tax increase proposed on the Nov. 6 ballot, saying Proposition 
134 would not fulfill its promises. 
</P>
<P>
Up to three-fourths of the tax revenue earmarked for law enforcement could go 
instead to unrelated programs, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Carre, an investigator with the county district attorney's office and 
representative of the police group, said: "The reason I take personal offense 
to this initiative is that it seems to say so much money is going to law 
enforcement, but it's not. I fail to see where in the world in that initiative 
it says money is going to law enforcement in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 134 supporters, such as Californians for a Nickel a Drink, said 
the wording has been misunderstood. Whereas the initiative says not less than 
3% of an available 17% of the total raised will be used for drunk-driving 
enforcement, foes have construed that to mean that just 3% will be used for 
that purpose, said Bob Reynolds, the group's state campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little warfare going on in law enforcement," Reynolds said. "If they 
want to use it all, that's OK. We said, 'no less than.' They are saying 'only.' 
</P>
<P>
"What's tragic in all this is that they've convinced law enforcement that their 
loyalties lie with the alcohol industry. Law enforcement agencies know what 
alcohol does, and for them to oppose this initiative is embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 134 would raise the tax on beer from 4 cents per gallon to 57 
cents, an increase of about 30 cents a six-pack. It would also raise the tax on 
wine from 1 cent per gallon to $1.29, a price increase of about 25 cents per 
750-milliliter bottle. The tax on hard liquor would increase from $2 per gallon 
to $8.40, or about $1.27 on a 750-milliliter bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the $760 million expected to be raised by this tax increase in 
the first year would go for treatment and prevention programs, emergency and 
trauma treatment, treatment programs for women, children and disabled people 
and law enforcement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of Proposition 134 instead back Proposition 126, which would also raise 
alcohol taxes, to collect about one-fourth the money that Proposition 134 
would, but would put the money into a general fund that could be used for law

<P>
CANDIDATE DEFENDS HIRING OF DETECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
City Council candidate Coween Dickerson Tuesday defended the actions of her 
former campaign treasurer in hiring a private detective to trail Councilman 
Miguel A. Pulido Jr. to find out whether he lives in the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Dickerson said at a press conference that she had accepted the resignation 
of the treasurer, Salvador Juarez, saying he should have informed her of his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, a self-employed business analyst, said that Juarez was trying to 
"act responsibly" in attempting to determine whether Pulido actually lives in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he did anything wrong," Dickerson said of Juarez, "but he should 
have asked me. I would have told him not to." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said that Juarez offered to resign last Thursday and that Zeke 
Hernandez, who lost to Pulido in the 1986 council race, will be her new 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring a detective, Dickerson said, was a "waste of money." She asserted that 
it is common knowledge that Pulido lived outside Santa Ana. Dickerson, who has 
made this a campaign issue, added that none of her campaign money was used for 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido maintains that he has lived in Santa Ana in a rented room since 1986, 
when he first ran for office. He described Juarez's resignation as "too little 
and too late." Dickerson and her supporters, he said, were making Juarez the 
"fall guy" for the "mistake of hiring an investigator." 
</P>
<P>
"If she can't control the activity of her own treasurer," Pulido said, "how 
could she purport to be a council person who's going to have a whole city under 
her responsibility?" 
</P>
<P>
Private investigator William Holland of Fountain Valley said Juarez hired him 
in August to determine whether Pulido was actually living in Fullerton at his 
family's home before moving to a house on Garnsey Street in Santa Ana last 
month. Holland said he has submitted his report to the district attorney's 
office. He said that Juarez paid him with his own checks. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said the office is reviewing the report.

3 MEN ASKING CASH FOR SMUGGLING BOY ARE SUSPECTED OF KIDNAPING

Police on Tuesday were searching for three men suspected of kidnaping a 
14-year-old Mexican boy and demanding a cash payment for allegedly smuggling 
him across the U.S. border to the home of relatives here. 
</P>
<P>
Maria and Marina Marin, sisters who share an apartment in the 800 block of 
South Fairview Avenue, told police that three men showed up at their door 
around 4:30 p.m., asking for $350 cash in exchange for their 14-year-old 
nephew, Police Lt. Charles Magdalena said. 
</P>
<P>
When the women could not come up with the money, the three men rejected their 
offer of $100 and some jewelry and drove off with the boy still in their car. 
</P>
<P>
The nephew, who was not identified because of his age, had somehow made his way 
across the border from his home in the state of Guerrero, Mexico, Magdalena 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at this along the lines that it is an illegal alien smuggling," 
Magdalena said, adding that police believe the men played a role in smuggling 
the youth to his aunts' apartment in the Fairview Villas complex. The women 
told police they "were not aware of any pending visit by the nephew," Magdalena 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the apartment complex, the men led the Marin sisters to a car in 
a parking lot, so they could verify the boy as their nephew. They also 
continued to demand $350, Magdalena said. 
</P>
<P>
The car, described as a brown, 1979 Plymouth, is registered to a resident of 
Anaheim, Magdalena said. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters, who could not be reached for comment late Tuesday, were slightly 
injured when the driver sped away, knocking them to the pavement.

VOTER REGISTRATION FOR 'PANIC TIME' LATECOMERS OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With less than one week left to register for the Nov. 6 general election, 
government offices are trying to make last-minute registration easier for 
county voters. 
</P>
<P>
Two official registration sites will be open late Oct. 9, the last day to 
register, and mail-in registration forms are available at most government 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Late filers are often people who have recently moved and did not realize that 
they need to fill out new voter registration forms, registration clerk Ann 
Halford said Monday: "People move and they think their new address follows them 
there. All of a sudden they learn they have to register, and it's panic time." 
</P>
<P>
The mail-in forms can be picked up at most city halls, public libraries, post 
offices, Department of Motor Vehicles offices and chambers of commerce. The 
forms must be signed and postmarked before midnight Tuesday and must be 
received by Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The county's registrar of voters office -- at 1300 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana -- 
will remain open until midnight Oct. 9. Mission Viejo City Hall will remain 
open until 10 p.m. that night as a South County site for late registration. 
City Hall is at 26522 La Alameda, Suite 190. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Grand Avenue office will also be open Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 
p.m. for in-person registration, as well as during the week from 7 a.m. to 6 
p.m.

GATES DISCUSSES HIS COURT DEFEAT IN PRIVATE MEETING WITH SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
SUIT JUDGMENT: THE CLOSED-DOOR DISCUSSION WAS 'JUST A FACTUAL PRESENTATION,' 
SHERIFF SAYS.

<P>
The County Board of Supervisors met in private with Sheriff Brad Gates on 
Tuesday to discuss a $246,000 court judgment awarded to two private 
investigators who alleged the sheriff's gun permit process discriminated 
against them and was fraught with favoritism. During the morning session, the 
supervisors adjourned their regular board meeting and slipped into a private 
meeting room to talk about Gate's court defeat for about 30 minutes. Matters 
involving lawsuits against the county or its agencies can be legally held in 
private unless the board takes formal action. 
</P>
<P>
When the meeting was over, news reporters descended on the sheriff, who 
declined to comment, saying it was "just a factual presentation." 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in the process of legal action, and I don't have any comment. 
Sometime in the future, we'll have a lot to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a federal jury decided that Gates violated the equal protection 
clause of the U.S. Constitution and awarded $246,000 in compensatory damages to 
Frank Ritter of Huntington Beach and his brother, Ty, of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritters, who were repeatedly turned down for concealed weapons permits in 
the late 1970s, charged that the system was unfair and riddled with cronyism. 
Under the equal protection clause, government officials dispensing public 
benefits must treat all citizens who apply for them equally. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors also found that Gates acted with "reckless disregard" for the Ritters' 
constitutional rights, which could open him up to the possibility of paying 
punitive damages out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. District Court hearing to determine how much Gates should pay was set 
for today before the same jury. It was postponed, however, until mid-November 
to accommodate Judge William P. Gray's vacation and a temporary assignment to 
another court. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors has the option of letting the county pay punitive 
damages if they are assessed, in effect indemnifying the sheriff for his 
actions. The county already is liable for the compensatory damages, which are 
based on the amount of bodyguarding contracts the Ritters' say they lost 
because they did not get gun permits from Gates. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors declined to comment on whether indemnifying the sheriff was 
discussed at their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Harriett M. Wieder said Gates called the session "to give us an 
update" on the case. When asked if the supervisors gave Gates a show of 
confidence or support, she said, "He didn't ask for one." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth declined to comment, saying county attorneys have 
advised them to be silent on the matter. He said, however, that "it is unfair 
to lump all these cases (against the sheriff) together" because they all are 
different. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a string of civil rights lawsuits brought against the 
sheriff over the last 12 years. So far, settlements and jury verdicts in those 
cases total almost $1.3 million. In addition, the county has spent at least $1 
million to defend the sheriff in court. 
</P>
<P>
Meir Westreich, the Ritters' lawyer, said that during the punitive damage phase 
of the case he will ask the jury to award the Ritters an additional $500,000. 
He said he will ask Gray to issue a permanent injunction against Gates to 
ensure that the process to issue concealed weapons permits treats all 
applicants fairly. Finally, Westreich said he will request that gun permits be 
issued to the Ritters. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez declined to comment. 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton could not be reached.

MAN DOING WORK ON DISNEYLAND RIDE IS CRITICALLY INJURED IN FALL

A 40-year-old La Habra man doing repair work on Disneyland's Pirates of the 
Caribbean ride Tuesday morning was critically injured when he fell 40 feet from 
a scaffold onto a concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Brooks was in critical condition in the intensive-care unit at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange with fractured ribs and internal injuries, hospital 
spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, an employee of Western Air and Refrigeration, was working on the 
air-conditioning system for the ride when the accident occurred shortly after 
8:30 a.m., Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks "was spanning the rafters (scaffolding), jumping across from one to the 
other, and he didn't make it," said Anaheim Fire Capt. Craig Watson, who 
treated Brooks at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Brooks was installing a new air-conditioning and ventilation system 
in an area behind a colorful stage front that portrays a battle between two 
pirate ships and a scene of pirates raiding a village. 
</P>
<P>
"He was able to break his fall somewhat and escape a serious head injury," 
Watson said. "There were piles of scenery and supports below, so he was able to 
grab, slip, grab, slip . . . before he landed on his side." 
</P>
<P>
The popular ride was shut down about a month ago for annual maintenance and 
will remain closed for several more weeks as work continues, McClintock said.

Doug Smith was a 24-year-old tackle in 1981 when he was slamming his body into 
defensive linemen so Wendell Tyler could rush for 1,074 yards. He was 
establishing himself at center and headed for his first Pro Bowl in 1984 when 
he was butting heads with 300-pound nose tackles so Eric Dickerson could gain 
an NFL-record 2,105 yards. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection by 1987 when 
he was helping pave the way for Charles White's 1,374-yard season. 
</P>
<P>
And he was attending his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl by the time Greg Bell had 
finished putting together back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons in '88 and 
'89. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bell, now a Raider, who said of Smith and Co.: "Anybody can run behind 
this line." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe not anybody. 
</P>
<P>
After three games, Curt Warner leads the Rams in rushing with 114 yards. At 
this pace, he'll finish with about 600 yards. Of course, the Rams are employing 
a triumvirate of tailbacks these days, but together they have managed only a 
3.4-yards-per-rush average. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the Ram running game is not the weapon it once was, but nobody is sure 
why. And even Smith, who has seen the holes open and close for 13 years, can't 
pinpoint the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You get in a game, and you try your hardest and you run the plays that have 
been called," Smith said. "We're doing our normal stuff. Maybe we just need to 
stay on our blocks a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing a long time and it seems like every year you reach a point 
where you say, 'OK, we've got to get back to the fundamentals.' Running, 
blocking, tackling, that's where we're at now. We're focused on the running 
game and we want to get back to being physical like we have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Smith says the Rams can work out the kinks on the practice field because he 
believes only some small adjustments are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at our won-loss record (1-2) and our (rushing) statistics and you 
know we're not setting the world on fire," he said. "So we re-evaluate, go back 
to the drawing board and start working hard again. 
</P>
<P>
"But people, and the media in general, will tend to say, 'Oh, they're no longer 
there. It's not happening.' But the difference between it happening and not 
happening is the matter of an inch here or an inch there. That can mean the 
difference between breaking a play and a two-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're really concentrating on getting another inch out of everybody on the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Add running game: Coach John Robinson says the backs, the offensive line and 
coaching are inseparable factors in the rushing attack. 
</P>
<P>
It's sort of like trying to coordinate all the aspects of a finely tuned golf 
swing. If just one part is slightly out of sync, the whole swing can go out of 
whack. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can say the reason you're not running the football is, and 
then have one or two things listed," Robinson said. "It just doesn't come out 
that way. You need to have everybody doing the things they need to do." 
</P>
<P>
However, Robinson was disturbed that the Eagles seemed to physically control 
the line of scrimmage during their 27-21 victory over the Rams.

"So much of it is blocking, finishing blocks and physically trying to dominate 
your opponent," Robinson said. "We've lost so much practice time (because of 
injuries) that we've lost some of that physical skill and determination. So 
we're practicing running the ball, trying to get that back. And I'm confident 
that we will."

Doug Reed, who admitted he spent many summer afternoons during his six-week 
holdout devouring tacos at his favorite stand, has been working hard to get in 
shape since he reported.

But the 6-foot-3, 265-pound defensive tackle says he did make a stop at the 
taco stand recently.

"I went by to see the old guy who runs the place the other day," Reed said. "I 
hadn't been there in a month and his eyes really lit up. 
</P>
<P>
"So I ordered 12 tacos."

NET GAIN: SMITH MAKING HIS MARK AS A SCORER

Kevin Smith was on top of the Big West Conference scoring statistics, if not a 
little bit of the world, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Then the UC Irvine men's soccer team was shut out twice. 
</P>
<P>
And Smith took a little tumble. 
</P>
<P>
He has fallen to third in scoring, and is left to worry about his team's 
prospects after the Anteaters lost to UC San Diego, 2-0, and to UC Santa 
Barbara, 4-0, last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough," Smith said, looking ahead to the conference season. 
"UCSB, they're not exactly one of the top teams in the conference, and they 
beat us pretty handily." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is looking for improvement from a team that went 3-15-1 last season. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he already has seen it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect too much this year," he said. "On the other hand, we've won 
four games and last year we only won three all year." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is 4-7-1 overall, 0-1 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is only a sophomore, but already he is making his mark as a scorer. He 
finished with six goals and five assists as a freshman, a year after scoring 16 
goals as a senior at Edison High School for a team that made it to the Southern 
Section 4-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Moved from his position as midfielder and forward last season to a pure forward 
this season, Smith's scoring has stepped up sharply. He scored five goals in 
the first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off to a great start," he said. "The midfielders were playing well 
behind me and giving me great balls." 
</P>
<P>
He also has six assists, illustrating his ability to create shots for teammates 
as well as make them himself. 
</P>
<P>
And if the team's success can keep step with Smith's, a season of progress 
might be ahead. There is much rejoicing about the progress being made in the 
women's program, too. Led by Michele Braceros, who has scored five goals in the 
past three games, the women have won four games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
And that's plenty enough to be a school-record winning streak for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (4-5-1) could tie its victory total of last year with a victory over 
U.S. International today at Crawford Field. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional opening day of basketball practice for the men's and women's 
teams is Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Bill Mulligan and the men's team will not continue its fledgling 
tradition of holding a public midnight practice, rolling out the balls the 
moment it is allowed by NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
The 15th falls on a Monday this year, meaning the practice would be held late 
Sunday night. Mulligan, trying to improve on a 5-23 record, decided against it, 
saying that Sunday night wouldn't be a good time for players or spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Mulligan said, when you hold a public practice, you have to scrimmage 
to entertain the fans and not just work on fundamental drills. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, after the worst season in school history, apparently don't mean 
to to waste any opportunity to get better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
The women's cross-country team, which will compete Saturday in the Stanford 
Invitational, is ranked 12th in the first NCAA Division I poll of the season. 
Villanova, the defending champion, is ranked first, receiving all eight 
first-place votes. No other California school is in the top 20. . . . In the 
Volvo Tennis preseason collegiate poll, the Irvine men's team is ranked 17th in 
the nation. The Anteaters were ranked 16th in the final poll last season, and 
Coach Greg Patton expects a strong recruiting class to keep the team in the top 
20. Four freshmen -- Brett Hansen-Dent (Newport Harbor High), Marco Zuniga (San 
Diego Bonita High), Brett Stern (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) and Charles Wheeler 
(South Africa) might be among Irvine's top six players. In other men's tennis 
rankings, Stanford is No. 1, UCLA is No. 2, Tennessee is No. 3 and USC is No. 
4. Other ranked California schools are California (No. 6), Pepperdine (No. 11), 
University of San Diego (No. 20) and Fresno State (tied for No. 25). . . . The 
water polo team is 7-6 after losing two of three matches on a Northern 
California trip last weekend and an overtime match to UCLA Tuesday. The 
Anteaters defeated Air Force at Stanford but lost to top-ranked Cal and 
third-ranked Stanford. . . . The deadline for purchasing season tickets for 
priority seating for men's basketball is Friday. Irvine sold about 850 season 
tickets last year.

FHP INTERNATIONAL WILL EXTEND SERVICE INTO SAN DIEGO COUNTY;

HEALTH CARE: HMO PLANS A $1-MILLION MARKETING CAMPAIGN AIMED AT BUSINESSES. IT

In a bid to expand its already large Southern California membership base, FHP 
International Corp. said Tuesday that it will soon expand its health 
maintenance organization network into San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens Scharwath, FHP's newly appointed regional vice president for San Diego, 
said the company hopes to begin marketing its prepaid health plans in the 
county later this month. The membership drive will be kicked off by a 
$1-million marketing campaign in the local media. 
</P>
<P>
FHP initially will market its health plans only to businesses in the San Diego 
area. But the company is awaiting approval from the federal Health Care 
Financing Administration to offer its programs for Medicare recipients in the 
county also. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to get at least 40,000 new members, both senior and commercial, 
within two years," Scharwath said. 
</P>
<P>
FHP now has 560,000 members, including 300,000 in Southern California. FHP's 
members are concentrated in Los Angeles and Orange counties, but the company 
has recently expanded into Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The company's entry into San Diego follows two years of planning and efforts to 
gain approval from the state, Scharwath said. 
</P>
<P>
The timing is important, he said, because it coincides with the three-month 
period during which most corporations offer employees the opportunity to switch 
medical insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into San Diego won't be easy for FHP, which will have to compete with 
numerous other HMOs that "have pretty much saturated the marketplace," said 
Michael Wilson, a Los Angeles medical benefits consultant. "The question will 
not be getting new enrollment, but who do you get it from." 
</P>
<P>
Among the HMOs already established in San Diego are Kaiser Permanente, by far 
the largest with 375,000 members, followed by Health Net with 100,000 members, 
Pacificare Health Systems Inc. with 70,000 and Aetna Choice Health Care Plan 
with 62,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any weaklings there," Scharwath said, acknowledging that FHP will 
face stiff competition. He noted that 32% of San Diego employees are already 
enrolled in an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
Scharwath said FHP's move into San Diego is prompted by its corporate customers 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties who want to offer the same health plan to 
their employees in San Diego. Scharwath is a former associate vice president of 
marketing for FHP in California. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the move to San Diego, FHP has been quietly contracting with 
about 200 physicians and eight hospitals in San Diego that have agreed to serve 
any new members it enrolls, Scharwath said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County most FHP members receive medical treatment from FHP 
physicians, but all care under FHP's plans in San Diego will be provided by 
independent physicians, Scharwath said.

LAW FIRM COLLAPSE BANKRUPTS ATTORNEY IN A BILLION-DOLLAR WAY

Steven Kray says he is bankrupt. Is he ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach attorney recently filed a petition for personal bankruptcy in 
federal court here saying that his liabilities outstrip his assets by $2.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
That's billion, a 10-digit number. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is about as clear as some court briefs. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Kray was a partner in the Irvine office of New York-based 
Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey. The law 
firm was the nation's fourth-largest before it collapsed in 1988 under a huge 
debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
The failure has spawned enough lawsuits to keep an army of attorneys employed. 
Malpractice suits pending seek $2.5 billion in damages. And the trustee 
overseeing the Finley Kumble bankruptcy is suing 40 former law firm partners to 
contribute to a fund to pay off creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than fight some of these suits, Kray figured the best way out was to 
declare bankruptcy. His Chapter 7 petition lists $2.5 billion in liabilities, 
presumably the total malpractice claims outstanding against Finley Kumble, and 
assets of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He listed no personal assets, only a potential $2-million claim against the 
Finley Kumble trustee. Kray, who was making $250,000 when he left Finley Kumble 
in 1987, now works in the two-attorney firm of Stephens &amp; Kray, which does 
taxes, estate planning, mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
While Victor Preston of Irvine, Kray's attorney, said it is unlikely that Kray 
could be held liable for $2.5 billion, his client would bankrupt himself 
fighting the lawsuits in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It would cost me too much money," said Kray, estimating the legal battle could 
run up a $200,000 bill in attorneys' fees and lost time at work. "The system 
does work, but it's expensive for the little person."

Moscow Joint Venture: Americom International Corp. of Irvine and Radisson 
Hotels International of Minneapolis have formed a joint venture with Intourist, 
the Soviet government travel agency, to manage an $80-million hotel and 
business complex Intourist has built in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Under the joint venture, called RadAmer-Intourist, Radisson will manage a 
430-room hotel and Americom will oversee a 170-suite business complex. The 
venture will be 50% owned by Intourist, which is building the complex, and 50% 
by RadAmer. Americom owns 80% of RadAmer and Radisson owns 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to be signed in Moscow within the next two months, 
said Bernard Rome, Americom chairman. Rome said the complex is expected to open 
next spring.

RATING FIRM DOWNGRADES BONDS OF BREA'S UNIONFED

Executives at UnionFed Financial Corp. will not discuss yet the "significant" 
loss the holding company is about to report, but a national bond-rating firm 
Tuesday said it is not waiting for details. 
</P>
<P>
Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago said it expects to downgrade both the senior debt 
securities and the short-term certificates of deposit at the company's main 
subsidiary, Union Federal Savings Bank in Los Angeles, once the company reveals 
the extent of its problems. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which recently moved its headquarters to Brea from Los Angeles, 
said last week that its deteriorating real estate loans and holdings would lead 
to a loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, reversing a previously reported 
$11.1-million year's profit. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the loss stemmed from a substantial increase in its reserves 
that had been ordered by federal thrift regulators, who are conducting an 
examination of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
UnionFed's deteriorating condition has made it one of the biggest third-quarter 
losers on the New York Stock Exchange. Its stock price dropped 73.8% -- the 
sixth-worst performance on the Big Board during the third quarter -- and 85.3% 
during the first nine months of the year, the 10th-worst performance. Its stock 
closed Friday at $2.625 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects to report its adjusted financial statement early next week. 
Until then, Duff &amp; Phelps has the S&amp;L's bonds and short-term 
certificates of deposit on a watch list with an "unfavorable trend" 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago firm, however, acknowledged that the S&amp;L, with $2.5 billion in 
deposits and 27 branches in Los Angeles and Orange counties, has a major 
advantage on its side. 
</P>
<P>
"While Union Federal has experienced serious deterioration in asset quality 
over recent quarters," the rating company said, "its substantial capital base 
provides a large layer of protection, and its large level of core deposits 
provides funding stability."

WORLD EVENTS LEAVE TEXTS IN LURCH; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHING: WRITERS OF HISTORY BOOKS AND MAP-MAKERS ARE OUTFLANKED BY EUROPEAN, 
MIDEAST CHANGES, LEAVING ORANGE COUNTY TEACHERS TO SORT IT ALL OUT.

<P>
The Berlin Wall is being dispersed around the world in souvenir-size chunks. 
But it still stands, immovable and permanent, in textbooks that are being 
thrown into lockers or lugged home in backpacks every day. 
</P>
<P>
Germany became a unified nation today. But on the shade-pull maps being lowered 
in front of blackboards, East and West stand divided, and the Eastern Bloc 
still lives. So too does Kuwait, though Saddam Hussein is trying to redraw it 
as Province 19 of Iraq, to the outrage of much of the world. 
</P>
<P>
History has done what history will do: It has kept happening, outpacing the 
textbook-writers and the map-makers and leaving teachers to explain one of its 
most profound lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings home the idea that nothing is fixed and concrete forever," said Ken 
Stichter, principal of La Habra's Sonora High School and the teacher of a 
senior history seminar. "This tells the students that history isn't something 
that never changes." 
</P>
<P>
It may be some time before classroom materials catch up with history. 
</P>
<P>
Editors and marketing managers at some of the largest publishers of textbooks 
say updated texts that include the events of the last year and reflect the 
passage of the Cold War are not yet widely available. More and more are being 
updated, but it may take up to two years before the process is complete. 
</P>
<P>
And even when accounts of the sweeping changes of the last year -- as well as 
the tension of the last two months in Kuwait -- are written, printed and bound, 
that may not mean that their arrival in the classroom is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"It is always a concern when history changes," said Gary Mieger, assistant 
superintendent for instructional services for the Fullerton Joint Union High 
School District. "But most school districts are not so wealthy they can just 
walk out and buy new textbooks because there is a unified Germany and no more 
Warsaw Pact." 
</P>
<P>
Some publishers took advantage of scheduled reprints to make changes and 
updates. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ravich, marketing manager at D.C. Heath &amp; Co. in Lexington, Mass. 
-- the nation's sixth-largest publisher of school books -- said its world 
history text had been updated by its author. 
</P>
<P>
"He faxed in stuff, rush-rush stuff," Ravich said. "There would be less 
analysis and more more-or-less factual presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows what's going to happen? Some people think they'll end up with 
non-communist dictators in those countries. . . . The last parts of books tend 
to be more journalism than history. We still don't know what's going to happen. 
Look at the situation in the (Persian) Gulf. What if we had to go to press 
today with a history book? That's the tough part there." 
</P>
<P>
Another publisher, the secondary school division of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, 
produced a booklet update of current events and distributed it free to its 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was written in a newspaper style, with headlines covering all regions of 
the world and the events that took place," said Carol Bloom, a senior editor 
based in Columbus, Ohio. "Others we had produced said things like, 'On Page 27, 
Column 1, the sentence in the second paragraph should now say . . . ' It wasn't 
very useful." 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers have turned to newspaper and magazine accounts and, increasingly, 
to videotapes of TV news. 
</P>
<P>
At El Toro High School, where Bill Bailey teaches world history and advanced 
placement European history, students will receive new, updated books next year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, by then they could be outdated too. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, one of the texts in use was printed in 1985, and another ends with 
accounts of the Cold War and the tense arms control negotiations of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to patch in current events right now," Bailey said. "Teachers seldom 
work out of the text to any degree of reliance. My final exam for the semester 
changes each year to reflect what has gone on in history, in an almost 
up-to-the-minute final. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so easy when the East-West conflict was static for so many years. Now, 
the last few finals have changed from Latin America to the European situation." 
</P>
<P>
Textbooks are not alone in their new-found obsolescence. Outdated maps need to 
be replaced as well, often at considerable expense. 
</P>
<P>
A standard classroom wall map of the world lists for $105 at Nystrom, a 
Chicago-based division of Herff Jones Inc., one of the largest producers of 
scholastic maps. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Fullerton, where the geography department budgets up to $1,000 a 
year for maps, several professors have requested that the entire allotment be 
spent on European maps. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Puzo, a Cal State professor of geography whose use of matching tests to 
point out students' ignorance of geography has been much publicized, said: 
"People don't care too much if it's Upper Volta or Burkina Faso. That (name 
change) happened four or five years ago, and people either didn't care or 
didn't notice. But if it's East Germany and West Germany, and lines around 
Berlin, people want to see it on the map." 
</P>
<P>
Map companies, like textbook companies, have been scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating demand for updated maps, Nystrom started making changes to reflect 
a unified Germany as early as July, meaning maps are now available for 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, boy, have we got maps," said Chuck Novosad, executive editor for social 
studies. "Obviously, there are quite a number of different maps in which 
Germany will appear. . . . We're not accustomed to seeing changes in Europe as 
much as in Asia and Africa. Being Eurocentric, we think this is unusual, when 
in fact the same thing has been happening in Asia and Africa for many years." 
</P>
<P>
As events change, so does the interpretation of those that preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
"Even recent textbooks place great emphasis on European nations and specific 
countries playing dominant roles," said Stichter, the Sonora High principal. 
"And here we are in a crisis in the Mideast in which a small country is really 
dictating the diplomatic actions of major powers of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Ravich, the D.C. Heath marketing manager, recalled the backpedaling after 
Americans were taken hostage in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"After the shah of Iran was out, we needed to go out and get that adjusted," 
Ravich said. "It was a whole new ballgame. The shah had been in most books 
described as a good friend to us, and Iran as an ally. All that flip-flopped. 
We went through quite a rewrite." 
</P>
<P>
But history keeps adding up while the books, and the school year, stay the same 
length. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, there have been so many things that have happened in the 20th Century 
that it is very hard to teach in two or three grading periods," said Bloom, the 
editor in the secondary division of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill. "It's very difficult 
to get through all that material." 
</P>
<P>
In one effort to keep teachers from getting bogged down somewhere around the 
Battle of Britain, some new texts are condensing earlier chapters to emphasize 
more recent history. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said she hopes "that will help the teacher get through World War II. And 
it's not so much World War II any more, now it's Vietnam. If they don't get 
past Vietnam . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we don't need a generation that doesn't know about Vietnam." 
</P>

THE PLACENTIA TROLLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA BRUNET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mother and her twin toddler daughters rode to the Human Services Center 
beside McFadden Park to pick up their 4-year-old brother from his preschool 
Head Start class. An older woman, picked up outside the Villa de Palma Senior 
Home, went to the market to shop for groceries. Three handicapped young men and 
an instructor embarked at Tri-City Park on Golden Avenue for a morning's 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
All were passengers on Placentia's red-and-green trolley, a free public service 
provided by the city. It travels 17 miles, makes 31 scheduled stops and 
completes its loop route from the starting point at Melrose Street at McFadden 
Park in an hour and 15 minutes. Passenger accommodations are maple-stained 
wooden seats resembling park benches, attached to the floor by wrought-iron 
legs painted green. 
</P>
<P>
Among the trolley stops are the Civic Center (City Hall and the Placentia 
Library), the post office, the Placentia-Linda Community Hospital, all city 
parks and all the shopping centers. It also calls at the senior citizen centers 
and mobile home parks. Drivers keep to the schedule within a grace period of 15 
minutes, allowing whatever time passengers need to embark or disembark. 
</P>
<P>
In its first few months after October, 1989, when trolley service began, most 
people traveled just for the ride and the tour of the city. Today, the trolley 
has been integrated into the city's life. Passengers include employees bound 
for work, mothers taking their children to school, senior citizens running 
errands, young people destined for the parks, and the occasional tourist out to 
see the sights. 
</P>
<P>
The trolley provides a valuable service not only for local residents but for 
some of the county's disabled as well. The Cole Vocational program, which works 
with adults who have either mental or physical disabilities, utilizes the 
Placentia trolley in its community integration lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"The trolley ride teaches (these adults) independence in the community, teaches 
them what resources are available," said program manager Susan Dinkel. "It 
allows them to be exposed to people in a social situation." In this 
non-threatening environment, "they can be integrated and be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
The number of daily riders has risen from an average of 24 in November, 1989, 
to an average of 60 or more in the spring and summer months. "The season drops 
off for riders" after the summer, trolley driver Lois Hasell explained in 
conversation with a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of direct revenue from the trolley appears to be no serious hardship 
for the city. Cecil Rospaw, vice chairman of the Placentia Historical 
Committee, went so far as to say that it may be paying for itself. "Look at the 
sales tax figures for Placentia -- up 6%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The trolley represents two things, Rospaw said. "Every person who rides is not 
driving a car; and every person who rides will make purchases that end up 
helping the city." 
</P>
<P>
The city trolley, he says, is "a good example of a very good solution." 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. Does 
not run on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: (714) 993-8245 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous Information: The ride is free. Trolley schedules (including a map 
showing the route) are available at City Hall, 401 E. Chapman Ave., and on the 
trolley. ELENA BRUNET

WAYS TO IMPROVE ON A TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your relationship with your father is distant and you yearn to be closer, 
stop dwelling on what could have been, advises Irvine psychologist Jane Myers 
Drew. To make peace in a troubled relationship and move on, she recommends: 
</P>
<P>
* Acknowledge the ways in which you feel you have been hurt or deprived. 
</P>
<P>
* Get past these negatives by expressing your feelings either indirectly or by 
talking or writing to your father if you feel ready to confront him. 
</P>
<P>
* Accept your father as he is. 
</P>
<P>
* Rework your relationship with him, which may mean spending more time together 
or, if he is abusive, less. 
</P>
<P>
* Forgive him for hurting you, and forgive yourself if you are feeling guilty. 
</P>
<P>
* Give back to him in some way that makes you feel good. 
</P>
<P>
* Look for the positive in him. 
</P>
<P>
* Respect him for doing his best. SHERRY ANGEL

ARTIST'S WORK TAKES AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL TURN

Shirley Glass doesn't see much separation between her art and her life. 
Speaking at the Rancho Santiago College Art Forum on Monday, she recalled that 
when she was younger, "the pencil was an extension of my hand." She carried one 
everywhere she went -- the theater, restaurants -- every day for two years, not 
just to learn how to draw but also to learn the subjects, and to move beyond 
them. To grow. 
</P>
<P>
"I started with apples, pears and flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Later at UCLA extension, where she studied for seven years starting in 1973, 
she was painting landscapes, still life and designs. 
</P>
<P>
"I repeated them over and over, until I was comfortable with the subjects," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mastery of drawing was a key that unlocked a deeper world, she continued, 
one of relationships, identities, fear, pleasure and pain. Portraiture marked 
the beginning of this exploration. Later came assemblage. 
</P>
<P>
Glass' early portraits are rich tapestries of lavish texture and color that 
focus on her main inspiration at the time, the human figure. She painted anyone 
who would sit for her; in one series she portrayed her mother in a "whole 
history in images of her ill-health and depression." 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, my mom needed personal care," she said. "I would bring her to my 
house and use her as my model because she primarily sat in such a depressed 
state. I painted portrait after portrait of her in oil and in pencil, in the 
den, the living room and the garden. It was a great union. She began liking 
what I did of her. It became a real healing for both my mom and myself." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Glass' work took a turn into an even more personal realm. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started making assemblages, I didn't know I was working through my 
dreams and childhood by using objects to paint, describe and tell my story," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblage pieces began as collections of found objects -- "streets and 
trash bins, became my treasure chests," she said. One piece, "Always a Bride 
Never a Bridesmaid," combined twigs, rings, dolls that were a wedding gift, and 
a headless bridesmaid into Glass' comment on her own life as a young bride. 
</P>
<P>
Her "Massacre 1" is also autobiographical. A plaster-of-Paris figure set inside 
a black coffin-like container and surrounded by packing foam and tiny lights, 
it "tells of my oppression as a child, and it comes from a very deep place 
inside of me. It is strictly for myself, but my art is like all art: It 
communicates a universality as well." 
</P>
<P>
Glass describes herself as a "storyteller. My art is about encountering and 
overcoming things inside myself. For me, the art deals with the process of 
life. I'm not pushing under the rug the pain I've experienced growing up, or 
the pain I feel now. For me, the art is working through it."

SOVIET MEZZO AT WILSHIRE EBELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With virtually no advance notice, one of the major luminaries of the San 
Francisco Opera and the Metropolitan Opera stopped in Los Angeles to give a 
recital Sunday night at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet mezzo-soprano Elena Obraztsova, who, according to available records, has 
not appeared in this city before, made her local debut in recital with pianist 
Michael Margovsky. 
</P>
<P>
At 53, the veteran singer has retained a powerful vocal presence as well as a 
stage manner both gracious and commanding. She looks handsome even standing 
behind a music stand. 
</P>
<P>
There were no printed programs. An announcer gave the agenda, item by item, 
over a microphone at center stage while singer, pianist and page-turner looked 
on. When the announcer mispronounced "Gianni Schicchi,", many in the audience 
corrected her, loudly. Several times during the concert flowers arrived -- 
between songs -- and were immediately placed on the piano behind Obraztsova. It 
was that kind of evening. 
</P>
<P>
The mezzo-soprano, as witness her operatic performances both live and on film, 
was ever one to give too much. And her reputation as a hypervocalist remains 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Still, and despite inconsistencies in register and dynamic control, her voice 
seems to have maintained its strength and timbre. She warmed up slowly, but to 
good effect. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, in a dozen Russian-language Romances -- by Glinka, Liadov and 
20th-Century composers -- Obraztsova entertained her audience with touching 
performances of musical material classy, sentimental, tragic and humorous. 
</P>
<P>
In between -- the Romances began and ended the event -- she offered operatic 
excerpts, first the predictable but welcome arias from Gounod's "Sapho," 
Bizet's "Carmen" and Saint-Saens' "Samson et Dalila," then "O mio babbino caro" 
(!) from "Gianni Schicchi" and "Voi lo sapete" from "Cavalleria Rusticana." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the uncharacteristic Puccini aria gave the most aural pleasure of 
the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Offering preludes by Scriabin and an etude by Rachmaninoff as an "interlude" -- 
the English- fracturing announcer's description -- pianist Margovsky showed 
himself a competent if uninspiring soloist. As accompanist to the singer, he 
proved only prosaic. DANIEL CARIAGA

London Calling: Matsushita Avionics Development Corp., a new Irvine-based 
avionics research subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of 
Japan, has opened a marketing office in London to bid for a large contract with 
Airbus Industrie of Europe, company officials said. 
</P>
