Joan Weinberg recently persuaded her students at the Alhambra Adult School to 
contribute $50 to victims of Hurricane Hugo. But it wasn't easy. She had to 
detail the victims' plight in a way that only a Southern Californian could 
really appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, when I told the class that the people needed money for clothes and 
medicine, I was met with a sea of stares," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Then she added that the victims didn't have money to buy gasoline for their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some gasps," she said, "and everyone started taking money out of 
their pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Mark it down: On Tuesday, Oct. 3, KFI radio broadcast a commercial for a 
weight-loss clinic that mentioned the approach of . . . Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Now, where have we heard one like this? 
</P>
<P>
The "Night Court" television show is filming a story this week in which a 
blonde, mature actress with a Hungarian accent calls police to report the theft 
of one of her jewels. When a policeman arrives, the alleged thief claims that 
the actress' dog swallowed the gem. An argument ensues, climaxed by the 
Hungarian actress slapping the cop. They all wind up in court. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Which brings to mind, for some reason, Zsa Zsa Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
You may recall how her driving landed her in court one time. Now, her driveway 
may take her back to court again. 
</P>
<P>
The famed motorist has filed a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming 
that her neighbor's tree roots cracked the driveway of her Bel Air home and 
forced her to repave it. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, recently convicted of slapping a Beverly Hills police officer, also 
asserts that her neighbor's dry, overgrown brush and shrubs extended on to her 
property and drew the attention of some uniformed officers from Los Angeles -- 
members of the city Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, deeming the vegetation a fire hazard, removed it at Gabor's 
expense. She's seeking $47,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The actress, who often characterized the Beverly Hills officer that she slapped 
as "gorgeous," makes no mention of the relative attractiveness of the 
firefighters in her suit. 
</P>
<P>
The radio bulletin sounded like a beach report as it discussed "500 feet of 
sand." But there were no sunbathers in this area. Only frustrated motorists. It 
was the Harbor Freeway, and workers were trying to soak up a diesel oil spill 
that clogged early-morning traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of sand, baseball season is winding down, but this is opening day for 
lobster season. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the traditional first crustacean was thrown onto shore in Redondo 
Beach early this morning during the Dive 'n' Surf shop's 13th annual Lobster 
Mobster contest. About 400 divers and dozens of unwilling lobsters were 
expected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Still hugging the shoreline, we bring you an account of a fellow who might be 
the world's most determined backward jogger, courtesy of the Beach Reporter, a 
Manhattan Beach newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The runner was making his way along the oceanfront Strand when he tried to pass 
two drunks "who had been antagonizing bicyclists, runners and walkers . . . all 
day," says the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
There was an altercation and the two drunks "chased him up the Strand, trying 
to box with him as he continued jogging backward." 
</P>
<P>
One drunk injured his foot trying to kick the still-moving runner. 
</P>
<P>
One drunk rode his bike after the runner and pulled a gold chain off his neck, 
which was later retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bicyclist, according to witnesses, "threw the bike at the runner." 
</P>
<P>
But he still failed to stop him.

We read with interest the letter (Sept. 20) by Gainer R. Lewis regarding 
campaign ads. His ideas regarding the role of the broadcasters and television 
political commercials should be further explored. 
</P>
<P>
On our latest trip to New Zealand in August, 1987, we experienced politics New 
Zealand style. Every evening on television after the 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. news 
program, each political party presented its views for approximately two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The parties' presentations were shown consecutively so that the voter could 
contrast and compare candidates and issues. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the political information was presented for only two weeks prior to 
the election, we, as visitors, felt that we had gained enough understanding of 
the candidates and issues to have made an intelligent and informed decision.

A WILDERNESS AT OUR DOORSTEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 55 miles in Ventura County, Sespe Creek flows through a large wilderness 
virtually on the doorstep of the nation's second most-populous metropolitan 
area. The Sespe crosses the California Condor Sanctuary and is considered the 
best native trout stream in Southern California. In testimony to Congress, 
Alasdair Coyne of the Keep the Sespe Wild Committee said: "When wandering along 
the river, enjoying complete quiet and undeveloped surroundings, it is hard to 
believe that downtown Los Angeles is only 75 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
The committee wants all 55 miles of the Sespe placed in the national wild and 
scenic rivers system as part of a Los Padres National Forest wilderness bill 
now before Congress. The original U.S. Forest Service proposal was to leave 
three stretches open to possible dam construction even though the service 
classified 51 miles of the stream as having "outstandingly remarkable values." 
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) has overcome opposition of some local 
interests to sponsor a bill that would protect the middle reach of the stream, 
but leave upper and lower ends open to water development. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would be strengthened under a proposal by Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica) to set aside the Cold Springs Reservoir site on the upper portion of 
the creek for further study of wilderness classification. Any dams seem 
impractical and uneconomic, and there are no specific proposals at the moment. 
Ideally, there should be no such construction on the Sespe. But it is important 
to achieve now whatever protection is politically possible.

HUMAN EMBRYOS CUSTODY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disturbed by Judge Young's ruling. I feel that his verdict, hinging on the 
controversial and yet un-codified statement that "human life begins at 
conception," is irresponsible and exceeds his legal parameters. I concur with 
the ex-husband, Junior Davis, that the key issue in the case has to do with 
whether the man should be compelled to father any number of children against 
his will, especially subsequent to his divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he is absolved of financial obligation for these potential children (a 
dilemma which Judge Young avoided, despite his 57-page decision), Junior Davis 
undoubtedly will be bound emotionally. As husband, he and his wife would share 
the decision about how many children to have, if any. Now, the court has 
usurped his rights. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud pro-choice activists for aligning themselves with Mr. Davis; it 
demonstrates they are consistent in their efforts to preserve reproductive 
freedom in this country, sensitive to the rights of both genders. For Judge 
Young to term these clusters of cells "children" is sentimentally manipulative, 
and stretches both the scientific and dictionary definitions of the word 
"children." Children exist in the open air, not in test tubes.

HUMAN EMBRYOS CUSTODY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hope Kate Michelman (executive director of the National Abortions Rights 
Action League) rethinks her hasty remark that the decision awarding custody of 
frozen embryos to Mary Sue Davis represents a "dangerous implication for 
reproductive freedom. . . ." To have supported Junior Davis' position that 
these embryos are "property" and that he should not have to father a child 
against his will would have had immediate and far-reaching effects on a woman's 
right to control her body. 
</P>
<P>
Once conception has taken place a man's biological function in the reproductive 
cycle is fulfilled. Since Roe vs. Wade, law has supported the woman's exclusive 
right to make all decisions subsequent to conception, including the right to 
terminate the pregnancy or bring to term a child. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Davis consented to these conceptions and, until the breakup of his 
marriage, consented to full-term planned pregnancies. He changed his mind after 
the fact of conception. A decision to support Mr. Davis' right to change his 
mind and prevent the birth of an already conceived embryo would seriously 
jeopardize the rights of women and subject them to lawsuits from disgruntled 
boyfriends or mates demanding to terminate these pregnancies because they "do 
not want to be fathers against their will."

POLICE CAN'T PREVENT DOMESTIC KILLING; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NAIVE AND DEADLY TO EXPECT A RESPONSE TO MOST THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN YOCUM, Susan Yocum is an officer with the Van Nuys Division Patrol of 
the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the continuing media flurry over domestic violence, prompted by Maria 
Navarro's grim and tragic murder, attention has focused on police protocol, 
training, sensitivity and action. The public cannot understand why a police car 
was not dispatched the moment that Navarro relayed her fears to the 911 
operator. Police are paid to protect and serve. Why didn't the Sheriff's 
deputies respond immediately to the reported threat by her estranged husband? 
Why don't police take domestic violence seriously? 
</P>
<P>
Maria Navarro told police that her husband had threatened to kill her, and 
tried to convince them that he would carry out that threat. She knew that she 
was right. She was right. And the police refused to respond to her call. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is that most of the threats arising from domestic 
disputes are just that: threats. Intended to frighten and intimidate, but 
seldom carried out. 
</P>
<P>
If police were to sit outside the homes of people who have been threatened, 
there would be no one to respond when you hear a prowler in your home. There 
would be no one to respond when you see a robbery in progress and no one to 
respond when your life is visibly in immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a matter of police apathy. It is not a matter of police insensitivity 
toward domestic violence. It is not a matter of sexist police policy. It's a 
matter of too much crime and too few police. It's a matter of practicality. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence has always existed. This decade can take credit for 
recognizing, defining, naming and publicizing it. State and national 
governments have given effort and money to research; statistics have been 
compiled. We now are aware that every six hours somewhere in this country, a 
woman is killed by her husband or boyfriend . 
</P>
<P>
As a police officer, I can testify that police training in domestic violence is 
complete. It has to be; answering calls to scenes of domestic violence involves 
great risk to our own lives. The Los Angeles Police Department's program is 
comprehensive and well-taught. We learn how to recognize cycles of domestic 
violence and how to counsel women who are victims of it. We are required to 
provide women with information on how to obtain restraining orders and with 
referral phone numbers for help ranging from psychological counseling to 
temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Further, court interpretations of California law have left very little to a 
street cop's discretion. For example, if you punch your neighbor, leaving a 
bruise on his arm, the officer called to the scene may try to get you and your 
neighbor to resolve the situation without legal intervention. If your neighbor 
insists on prosecution, you will be arrested, taken to jail and booked on a 
misdemeanor charge of battery. 
</P>
<P>
However, if a man hits his wife and a similar bruise appears on her, the police 
officer called to the scene has no option. Regardless of the wife's desires or 
the husband's explanations, he will be taken to jail immediately and booked on 
a felony charge of spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
With the accused in jail, police action becomes secondary. He will be released 
by the court system in a matter of days or hours. It is up to the victim to 
prosecute, something abused women seldom do. Even when they do prosecute, the 
case is often resolved with a plea bargain or a token prison term, both of 
little use to women who justly fear for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers strive to protect everyone in society, but we cannot always 
prevent. In Navarro's case, had police been on the scene to stop her husband, 
they would have taken him into custody for, at most, carrying a concealed 
weapon. That would have kept him in jail overnight, assuming he couldn't make 
bail. Anyone who believes that a person determined to kill another can reliably 
be prevented from doing so by the police -- or anyone -- is dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
Success in dealing with domestic violence demands action from the abused women 
themselves and from the courts. Women who have been beaten or threatened too 
frequently decide to give the abuser another chance. All too often the cycle 
begins anew. These women must want to extricate themselves from abusive 
relationships and they must seek the prosecution of their abusers. Those who 
are abused must also take steps to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The legal system must really punish those men whose wives and girlfriends are 
brave enough to prosecute. At present, a man convicted of spousal abuse will 
spend little time in jail. Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has made a strong statement 
by directing his office to prosecute gang members in Los Angeles County to the 
fullest extent of the law. If we are truly serious about protecting women from 
abusers and potential murderers, we must demand that prosecutors do the same. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to say that a woman should have to leave her own home, but in 
the case of Navarro and many other abused women, that is the action most likely 
to keep them safe after a serious threat. Why did Navarro and her guests stay 
in her home, even when she believed her husband's threat, and the police had 
explained they could not yet take action? 
</P>
<P>
Maria Navarro was a victim. But police cannot be held accountable for the 
actions of a crazed person who has a gun. Looking to police to prevent and 
solve domestic violence is both naive and deadly.

Photo, Theme Park for Las Vegas MGM Grand Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive 
Fred Benninger unveils the company's plans for a movie theme park and a 
5,000-room MGM Grand hotel and casino in Las Vegas. At a Beverly Hills news 
conference Tuesday, Benninger said MGM Grand agreed to buy the 700-room Marina 
Hotel &amp; Casino and 115 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip to be used as 
the site for the $700-million project. Several potential partners had 
approached the company about participating in the development, including an 
unidentified Japanese concern, but no decision about partners has been made, 
Benninger said. Pending the completion of a feasibility study, the park is 
scheduled to open in 1992. JOSE GALVEZ / Los Angeles Times

MORNING REPORT: 'CHICKEN SOUP' HOT, OTHER ROOKIES NOT

There are no runaway hits among the 24 series that the TV networks have 
introduced this season. According to ratings released Tuesday by the A.C. 
Nielsen Co., only one, ABC's "Chicken Soup," finished among last week's 20 
most-watched programs -- and even its 11th-place finish was tarnished by the 
fact that it was tuned out by about 25% of the viewers who watched its lead-in, 
"Roseanne." The full list of ratings is on Page 12. 
</P>
<P>
* If you want to talk about drops, however, the rookie that took the biggest 
plunge of the week was ABC's "Living Dolls." When it premiered Sept. 26 behind 
"Who's the Boss?," it attracted viewers in about 18.8 million homes. When it 
moved to its regular time slot four days later, the audience fell to 7.6 
million homes -- a 60% decline.

A museum devoted to the art, films and archives of Andy Warhol will be 
established in an old industrial building in the late artist's native 
Pittsburgh, it was announced Tuesday by the Carnegie Institute, whose Carnegie 
Museum of Art will operate the facility. The museum is scheduled to open in 
1992 and will be one of the first in the United States to exhibit the work of a 
single artist on the scale of the Picasso Museum in Paris. The core of the 
museum's collection -- more than 700 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptural 
works, films and videotapes -- will be donated by the Andy Warhol Foundation 
for the Visual Arts and the Dia Art Foundation, both of New York. ALEENE

Who says the classics aren't popular? Telephone sales began Sunday for Sir 
Peter Hall's Broadway production of "The Merchant of Venice," opening Dec. 19, 
and the day's take was $295,380. Monday's (to 5 p.m.) was more than $119,000. 
That's almost half a million dollars in two days for a 400-year-old play. It 
could have something to do with the actor playing Shylock -- Dustin Hoffman.

HUNTER DEFEATS CORREIA, LYLES IN 76TH-DISTRICT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a race that drew national attention as a referendum on the U.S. Supreme 
Court's recent abortion ruling, Tricia Hunter, a pro-choice Republican, won a 
special state Assembly contest that could provide a prelude to the 1990 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Final unofficial vote totals showed that Hunter, a 37-year-old Bonita nurse 
whose pro-choice stance attracted traditional Democratic support in the heavily 
Republican 76th District, received 49% of the vote to defeat Democrat Jeannine 
Correia and two write-in candidates -- one of them fellow Republican Dick 
Lyles, a Poway businessman who ran a close second in the August primary. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 15,000 write-in votes remaining to be counted, Hunter's lead was 
insurmountable, even if Lyles receives all of those ballots in the conservative 
San Diego-Riverside County district. 
</P>
<P>
According to the final figures, Hunter received 25,302 votes, while Lyles 
apparently finished second with about 19,800 votes, assuming he received most 
of the write-in ballots cast Tuesday -- votes that will not be verified until 
today. Correia finished third with 6,587 votes, while the race's other write-in 
candidate, Republican Kirby Bowser, finished a distant fourth in the election 
to fill the vacancy created by the June death of Assemblyman Bill Bradley 
(R-Escondido). 
</P>
<P>
The turnout in the election was 21%, slightly higher than officials had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victory Was Hailed 
</P>
<P>
Though Lyles' write-in status, with its attendant political difficulties, skews 
interpretations of the abortion issue's impact on Tuesday's vote, the outcome 
was hailed in advance as a harbinger of the emotional topic's enhanced 
political import as a result of the states' new court-approved powers to limit 
the circumstances under which abortions are available. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can win in this district, we can win anywhere," Robin Schneider, 
director of the California Abortion Rights Action League's Southern California 
chapter, said during the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Although anti-abortion activists resisted framing the contest as an up or down 
vote on abortion, they nevertheless aggressively backed Lyles, recognizing that 
a Hunter victory not only would be politically embarrassing but could alter the 
Legislature's philosophical balance on abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
The 76th District campaign's framework was constructed early in the primary 
when the U. S. Supreme Court, scaling back the pro-choice latitude established 
by its landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, issued its controversial ruling giving 
states new authority to restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
With Hunter's pro-choice position setting up a compelling ideological showdown 
in an eight-candidate field filled with anti-abortion Republicans, the 
otherwise obscure race attracted extensive national news coverage as one of the 
first tests of the political fallout from the court's July decision. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing support that typically goes to Democrats -- much of it from pro-choice 
activists hoping to capitalize on a rare opportunity to gain an ally in a 
solidly conservative district -- Hunter narrowly edged Lyles in the August 
primary, 14,885 votes to 14,688. Although Democrat Correia finished fifth, the 
primary's unorthodox format -- in which all candidates of all parties appeared 
on a single ballot -- allowed her to qualify for the runoff by outpolling the 
only other Democrat in the race to complete Bradley's unexpired term, which 
runs through the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Hunter's 197-vote victory would have caused the 
runoff in the heavily Republican district to loom as little more than an 
electoral formality. With Republicans holding a 55%-32% registration edge, 
victory in the GOP primary historically is tantamount to election in the 
district, which stretches from the South Bay to northeastern San Diego County 
and into the desert communities of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' decision to continue his campaign despite his primary loss, however, 
created at least some uncertainty about the outcome, consequently raising 
concern among Republican leaders who feared that his write-in candidacy could 
split the GOP vote, giving at least a glint of hope to Correia, whose chances 
normally would be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissively treating Lyles as a sore loser who failed to accept defeat, Hunter 
largely ignored her erstwhile primary opponent in the runoff campaign, refusing 
to participate in any forum to which he had been invited in a strategically 
shrewd move to curtail his visibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Hunter's campaign advisers, determined to avoid overconfidence born of the 
formidable obstacles facing any write-in, regarded Lyles as a serious threat. 
Several Hunter mailers singled out Lyles for caustic criticism, including one 
that described him as "the choice of the gun lobby, anti-choice extremists and 
the Sacramento Cavemen," with the last phrase referring to arch-conservatives 
in the Republican Assembly caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the runoff, the campaign reflected an inherent irony: Hunter, who 
owed her very presence to the abortion issue's ascendancy in the primary, 
consistently sought to minimize its significance, terming it "only one of many 
issues -- and not even one of the top ones -- people are concerned about." 
Meanwhile, Lyles, who was victimized by the issue in August, fought to maintain 
its preeminence in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"In the time it takes you to vote, four babies will die from abortion," warned 
a Lyles brochure, distributed outside churches last weekend. The same pamphlet, 
which contrasted Lyles' staunch anti-abortion position with the pro-choice 
advocacy of both Hunter and Correia, featured a photo of a baby, with a caption 
saying: "This little guy wants YOU to vote Oct. 3." 
</P>
<P>
In part, the paradoxical manner in which Hunter and Lyles addressed the 
volatile issue stemmed from their recognition of how the political equation 
governing its impact had changed dramatically from the primary to the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
As the sole pro-choice Republican in the primary, Hunter benefitted from 
saturation coverage that allowed her to catapult from the middle of the pack. 
In the runoff, however, Hunter realized that she had nothing to gain from a 
one-on-one confrontation with Lyles and that her interests would be better 
served by a quiet campaign that dampened passions on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Lyles, who was forced to carve up the anti-abortion vote with four 
other Republicans in the primary, saw an obvious numerical advantage in 
carrying that banner alone in the runoff. More importantly, Lyles and his 
strategists recognized the intense emotion generated by the issue as an 
essential ingredient in their uphill bid to win a race in which his name was 
not even on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion is the kind of issue that motivates people to turn out and take that 
extra step to write in a candidate's name," said Lyles, a 42-year-old 
management consultant. "I think it's going to be a major factor -- maybe the 
factor -- in the election." 
</P>
<P>
Correia, meanwhile, acknowledged that her admittedly slim chances hinged on a 
badly divided GOP vote.

MODERN PRESSURES ON EL MONTE AIRFIELD SOUR ROMANCE OF FLYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dean Cayot remembers when El Monte Airport was little more than a landing strip 
on a stretch of sandy riverbed, surrounded by dairy farms. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a dairy right there where the tower is," said the flight instructor, 
pointing at the airport's squat tower, topped by the usual glassed-in air 
traffic control center. "The farmer didn't like the airport, so he used to pile 
bales of hay down at the end of the runway. Every once in a while, his cows 
would break out, so you'd come in to find a runway full of cows." 
</P>
<P>
The scene at El Monte Airport, a 103-acre stretch of open ground wedged between 
Santa Anita Avenue and the Rio Hondo Flood Control Wash, often still has a 
sleepy, rural quality. With a single 4,000-foot north-south runway, the field 
sees little of the hectic, split-second airborne choreography of an urban 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
But the county-owned general aviation facility, catering mostly to private 
fliers, has progressed far beyond the pasture days. 
</P>
<P>
"This little field really pops sometimes," said air traffic controller Ira 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Anita Park is open, with the high-rollers winging into the area from 
across the state, and when law enforcement officers are on the prowl in the San 
Gabriel Valley in their helicopters, the El Monte runway has been known to 
handle as many as 125 takeoffs and landings in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been called one of the busiest airports per square foot," said Fred 
Berry, supervisor of the control tower. 
</P>
<P>
Cayot, 64, a short, tightly packed man with an iron-gray crew cut, leans 
against a car at the opening of a big hangar belonging to Alpine Aviation, one 
of three flight instruction and airplane maintenance firms on the field, and 
considers how El Monte Airport has changed since he first started flying there 
25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A forest of little private planes, an assortment of high-winged Cessnas and 
low-winged Pipers, spreads across the Tarmac next to the taxiway. Long, low 
hangars, laid out in a row like Army barracks, parade toward the far end of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came here, there wasn't a building that's here now," Cayot said. 
</P>
<P>
A Cessna Citation jet, a small corporate airplane that California Edison uses 
to transport its executives around the state, suddenly swoops down the runway 
and, with a high-pitched whistle, roars off to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Private jets, and the noise they make, are another recent development, said 
Cayot. "Like all the rest of the world," he said, "things get more complex as 
it goes around." 
</P>
<P>
Complex and nettlesome. As with small fields everywhere, the turning world has 
brought troubles to freedom-loving private pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the recent economic picture for the general aviation industry 
depressed -- as are, consequently, prospects for expanded business at the 
airport -- but private pilots in El Monte must contend with adversaries 
including edgy federal regulators, soaring fuel prices, smog and neighbors 
complaining about noise. 
</P>
<P>
You get used to the grinding motors of the little single-engine planes, grouses 
William Dohman, president of the tenants association at Daleview Mobile 
Estates, a development for senior citizens north of the airport. "It's the big 
planes," he said. "They're very noisy. They have to get down so low to have 
enough space to stop. It drowns everything out." And the helicopters -- they 
really churn things up, he added. "Some people complain that, as the 
helicopters go over, the chimes in their clocks go off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The airport management and pilots who use the airport have devised a noise 
abatement procedure that directs planes away from residential areas, advising 
pilots to follow the flood control channel that skirts the western edge of the 
runway. And circling planes are directed by air traffic controllers into a 
pattern 1,000 feet above the airport, instead of the customary 800. 
</P>
<P>
Big signs near both ends of the runway, where airplanes rev up their motors 
before taking off, spell out the departure procedure, complete with diagrams 
and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager Gary Harshman goes to the south end to show how it works. He 
points at a Cessna 150 churning down the runway and lofting toward Orange 
County. "See, he's making a slight right turn," he said, as the airplane 
follows the westward meander of the flood control channel, veering away from a 
residential neighborhood south of Valley Boulevard. "That's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
But some complain that the procedures are regularly violated. "They don't live 
up to it at all," said Cloyd Brackney, another Daleview resident. 
</P>
<P>
Others said it's not the noise that bothers them but the danger. "It never 
bothered me until a couple of years ago, when all the airplanes started falling 
out of the sky," said Lee Mendoza, who has lived on Bessie Avenue, west of the 
airport, for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harshman insists that there is better than 90% compliance with the noise 
abatement procedure. "If you have a brand new student, it might be difficult 
for him," he said. "Or maybe somebody from out of town. But most comply." 
</P>
<P>
Nagging disputes between airport and neighbors, whose homes crowd the field on 
all sides, have been going on for so long that there's a ritual quality to it. 
"They call up and say, 'The planes are knocking the pictures off my wall,' " 
said one battle-hardened air traffic controller. "You want to say, 'Get bigger 
nails.' But you have to be polite." 
</P>
<P>
But the city, and its leaders, appear to have accepted the continued existence 
of the airport (although one city official says privately, "If the airport 
wasn't there, that would be a heck of a piece of property to develop."). 
</P>
<P>
More worrisome to airport administrators and private pilots is the sputtering 
state of the general-aviation industry. The airport's business has eroded in 
recent years, and the county is considering leasing it to a private firm. A 
combination of high fuel costs (about $1.75 a gallon for "100 low lead" at the 
airport fuel station), rising insurance premiums, sticker shock for airplane 
buyers and high rental costs have cut down on airport operations, county 
administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, you could rent a plane for $13 an hour," said Cayot, who ran the 
field's Piper dealership for 13 years before high costs forced him out of 
business. "Now, the same plane will cost you $45 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Although El Monte has always been a profitable airport, with income last year 
of more than $500,000, business in the county is stagnant, county officials 
say. Ten years ago, during the heyday of general aviation in Southern 
California, El Monte registered 235,000 takeoffs and landings a year. This 
year, Harshman said, the airport may not crack 190,000. 
</P>
<P>
What this means for private pilots is the likelihood of dealing with a private 
contractor on the field, and paying higher fees for hangar space and tie-down 
rights. "From conversations we've had (with county officials), we figure it's 
probably 50-50" that the airport will go private, said Dennis Robinson, 
president of the 100-member San Gabriel Valley Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
More troublesome still for many pilots are increasing restrictions on where 
they can fly and what kind of equipment they'll be required to have. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tricky Location 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old airport, one of two in the San Gabriel Valley (the other is 
Brackett Field in La Verne), is wedged between the San Gabriel Mountains and 
the terminal control area, the broad chute of airspace through which the big 
westbound jet airliners travel to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the Federal Aviation Administration nervous. Wright, during a slow 
period in the control tower, points out the big picture on a map. Three miles 
off the southern end of the El Monte runway, over Legg Lake, is the edge of the 
terminal control area, whose lower extremity at that point is at 2,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that big a factor, unless someone's doing something they're not 
supposed to be doing," said Wright. 
</P>
<P>
But federal bureaucrats, with the nightmare of a 1986 collision between an 
Aeromexico DC-9 and a private plane over Cerritos still vivid, are doing 
everything they can to make sure that kind of accident does not happen again. 
For example, the FAA may soon require all airplanes flying out of El Monte to 
be equipped with a special altimeter that can be read via a radar signal by air 
traffic controllers. The minimum cost, said Robinson, will be about $700. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem fair," said one pilot, "if your normal pattern doesn't take 
you anywhere near LAX." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's Pace 
</P>
<P>
Problems such as these have taken away some of the romance of flying, pilots 
complain. "Maybe there was more camaraderie in the past," said Cayot. "There 
were more people standing around, kicking dirt and doing hangar flying. More 
people sat around on the weekends and talked about flying than actually flew." 
</P>
<P>
Many complain that the airport lacks a terminal and restaurant to serve as a 
focus for airport life. "Pilots will fly in and ask you, 'Now, where's the 
restaurant?' " said air traffic controller Cherie Conners. "When you tell them 
there is none, they turn around and fly right back out." 
</P>
<P>
Cayot, for one, isn't sure that the airport's lack of "hangar fliers" is such a 
bad thing. "Sure, I miss (the old days), though you get so you know all the 
stories backwards," he said. "But there are two sides to it. It's nice to have 
camaraderie and friends, but it wastes a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dentice, a bustling man who works as mechanic and pilot, has been a 
fixture at the airport since the early 1970s. The FAA, with all of its new 
restrictions on private planes, is going into overkill, said Dentice 
vehemently, as he poked with a wrench at the motor of a small single-engine 
airplane in his small hangar. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't want risk, stay in your bedroom and hope there's no fire or 
earthquake," he said. Dentice, 58, is one of three master mechanics at the 
airport who work as FAA inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
But Dentice doesn't buy the death-of-romance arguments. "When you break out on 
top of the clouds and -- how does the poem go? -- 'slip the surly bonds of 
earth,' it never fails to promote an emotion," he said. "The romance and awe 
are still there." 
</P>
<P>
Then Dentice, who flies to El Monte daily from his home in Crestline, in the 
San Bernardino Mountains, thinks about commuting. "When you're following the 
210 Freeway at 120 m.p.h., looking down at all the red (brake) lights down 
there," he said, "that's another kind of emotion."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CORPORATIONS LAUNCH MINORITY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 corporations joined forces this week to launch the California 
Minority Counsel Program, designed to increase opportunities for ethnic 
minority attorneys in corporate legal work. 
</P>
<P>
At news conferences in Los Angeles and San Francisco, William Bogaard, general 
counsel of First Interstate Bancorp, and Guy Rounsaville, chief counsel of 
Wells Fargo Bank, outlined steps corporations will take to forge a "long-term 
working partnership" among corporate counsel and minority- and majority-owned 
law firms throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"First Interstate is extremely proud to be a part of this effort," Bogaard 
said. "It is our hope that all California corporations will join us in helping 
to assure that equal professional opportunity becomes a reality for minority 
attorneys of this state." 
</P>
<P>
Participating corporations have agreed to increase the number of minority law 
firms they retain as outside counsel for legal work. About 70 minority-owned 
firms have agreed to participate in the program.

HUNTER ORDERED CAMPAIGN DEPOSIT, J. DAVID AIDE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former J. David &amp; Co. employee testified Tuesday that she was following 
the direction of Nancy Hoover Hunter when she deposited company funds into her 
own checking account so she could make a contribution to Roger Hedgecock's 1983 
mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Milich, who was director of community relations at J. David for about one 
year before the collapse of the firm, said Hunter offered her $500 from the 
community relations account, which contained money that was normally donated to 
charitable groups. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter "asked me if I was for Roger Hedgecock," Milich testified at Hunter's 
fraud and tax evasion trial. "She said, 'Why don't you make a contribution? You 
can take it out of our account.' " 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that tax deductions Hunter took against business losses were 
illegal because the firm she had invested in, Tom Shepard &amp; Associates, was 
set up to illegally funnel money into the Hedgecock campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 197 charges against Hunter, however, concern her alleged 
participation in the giant Ponzi scheme masterminded by Hunter's former lover, 
J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted with a rumor that J. David &amp; Co. was a bogus business, 
Hunter blamed it on jealous traders who were not experiencing the same success 
as those at the La Jolla investment house, Milich testified. 
</P>
<P>
"People just get jealous" when confronted with success, Milich quoted Hunter as 
saying when asked about the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Milich made the remark while she was testifying about a meeting she had with 
Dominelli and Hunter after she had been told that J. David was "a house of 
cards that was going to fall." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's attorneys maintain that Hunter was completely unaware of the giant 
fraud, which cost 1,200 people nearly $90 million, because she was in love with 
Dominelli, a man considered by many at the time to be a genius trader.

UCSD BOOKSTORE HAS 80,000 TITLES COVERED, THE MOST IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated because none of the bookstores you visited carry "Lung Sounds, A 
Practical Guide" (includes book and audio cassette)? Have you searched far and 
wide for "Numerical Recipes in C," but none of the bookstores carry it? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you are looking for something more practical, like the 1989 edition of 
"Baseball Superstats," but your local bookstore is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
If any or all of the above books appeal to you but are missing at your favorite 
bookstore, try the newly dedicated UC San Diego bookstore, which carries 80,000 
titles and about 400,000 volumes, including the previously named books. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson dedicated the bookstore, the largest in San 
Diego County, on Tuesday, three months after it opened. Bookstore manager Paul 
Mares was beaming like a proud parent throughout the day, amid flowers and 
congratulations sent by many university and college bookstore managers across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The college bookstore industry is something you stay in. We (managers) all 
know each other," said Mares, who has managed the UCSD bookstore for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mares was joined at Tuesday's festivities by about 20 bookstore managers from 
other colleges throughout Southern California, who came to check out the new 
digs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Special Events 
</P>
<P>
The university has scheduled several events throughout October to celebrate the 
new bookstore. Oliver Sacks, best-selling author of "The Man Who Mistook His 
Wife for a Hat," will be signing copies of his latest book, "Seeing Voices," on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Heinz-Otto Peitgen will give an audio-visual presentation on 
fractals at 6 p.m. at the Price Center Theatre. The presentation will include 
"a spectacular, full-color demonstration of fractal images using complex 
computer graphics." 
</P>
<P>
"What are fractals?" you ask. Do not bother looking for a definition in the 
dictionary, because it is not there. UCSD spokeswoman Barbara Fisch said 
fractals represent "the delicate structure that underlies chaos in nature." In 
the everyday world, this means, for example, that something like "a cloud or 
mountain is actually ordered and not chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
Fisch went on to say that "chaos is a relatively new area of scientific study." 
</P>
<P>
Peitgen is an expert on fractals and wrote "The Beauty of Fractals" and "The 
Science of Fractal Images." Both books have been used by UCSD faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what the faculty wants. We get it for them. But we don't understand 
what they do with it," said Mares, past president of the National Assn. of 
College Stores and current president of the nonprofit College Stores Research 
and Educational Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fractals and modern technology are together wreaking havoc on Kant's 
"thing-in-itself" philosophy, which says that the "thing" represents the limit, 
rather than the object, of man's knowledge. Fractals are forcing "things" like 
mountains and clouds to cough up their deepest secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The bookstore, which covers two levels, is open to the public. In addition to 
books, the store carries some clothing items and general merchandise. All 
items, except computers, can be purchased by the public. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mares, the UCSD bookstore is the 20th largest college bookstore in 
the United States and sold about $6.5 million worth of books last year.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man accused of being the hit-and-run driver of a car that killed a pregnant 
mother and her 5-year-old daughter last week pleaded not guilty Tuesday at his 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Salvador Cabrera, 22, of San Diego, was charged with two counts of 
vehicular manslaughter, hit and run, driving under a revoked or suspended 
license and driving without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Martha Lidia Zamudio, 25, who was eight months pregnant, and 
Lillian Beth Zamudio were killed in National City while they were crossing a 
busy street. 
</P>
<P>
The driver sped off, and another man who had damage to his car was arrested. 
However, after an investigation, that man was released and National City Police 
said Cabrera was the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera was arrested Saturday after a chase that began in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay Municipal Court judge in Chula Vista set bail for Cabrera at 
$300,000 and ordered a bail review. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was set for October 30. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were buried Tuesday after a service in Tijuana. Some of the 
victim's relatives attended Cabrera's arraignment.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council, with only six of its nine members present, delayed 
until Oct. 30 a decision on a proposal to build a 472-foot luxury condominium 
tower at Broadway and State Street. 
</P>
<P>
With council members Abbe Wolfsheimer, Gloria McColl and Ed Struiksma absent, 
the council could not come up with a five-vote majority for the Huntington 
building, an alternative development, or a proposal to solicit new project 
ideas for the city-owned site. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium project has been approved by the Centre City Development Corp. 
but has failed to win council approval several times in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the building's height makes it incompatible with its 
surroundings. Two council members, Bob Filner and Judy McCarty, voted Tuesday 
for an alternative proposal by another developer to build 287 less-expensive 
rental apartments in a smaller structure that also would house a child care 
center.

Raw sewage spilled onto Windansea Beach Tuesday when a pump station on Neptune 
Place in La Jolla lost power. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Calvert of the county Department of Health Services said 9,000 to 10,000

flowed out to sea when Pump Station No. 21 lost power at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric restored power an hour later. Calvert said he

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police are searching for two men who escaped from the back seat of 
separate police cars parked at police headquarters Monday, a police spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a man who identified himself as Chris A. Brown, 31, of 30th Street, 
escaped about 2 p.m. from a police car parked in the basement area of police 
headquarters at 1401 Broadway. Officials are "perplexed" by the escape and 
unable to explain how the handcuffed Brown managed to get outside the vehicle, 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
To compound the situation, Robinson said another man, identified as Martin 
Garcia, 29, escaped about two hours after Brown. Officials suspect that Brown 
returned to the area and released Garcia by opening the police car door, 
Robinson said. Both Brown and Garcia were in custody on suspicion of auto 
theft, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said standard procedure calls for officers to leave suspects 
unattended while they run record checks before transporting them to County 
Jail. The building's parking area is enclosed by fences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials suspect that Brown and Garcia fled through a pedestrian gate used by 
Police Department personnel, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that he could not recall a similar escape but that the procedure 
for leaving suspects unattended while officers enter the headquarters building 
is under review.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 ARRESTED, 1 SOUGHT IN VAN NUYS KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested one man and were looking for another in connection with the 
kidnaping and pistol-whipping of a Van Nuys man after a drug deal apparently 
went sour, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Kern County sheriff's deputy found the victim, John McGuigan, 25, bound and 
bleeding on the Tejon Ranch about 45 miles south of Bakersfield about 12:30 
p.m. Monday, Senior Deputy Richard Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
McGuigan had been kidnaped Sunday night in Van Nuys, beaten with a handgun, 
tied up and placed in the trunk of a car by two men, Dixon said. Los Angeles 
police had been investigating McGuigan's disappearance based on information 
from relatives who said they believed he might have been killed, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kern County sheriff's deputy found the victim lying in a field after he 
went to investigate a car that was parked alongside I-5, Dixon said. Victor 
Balanos-Cazares, 24, of Van Nuys, was arrested after he fled from the scene on 
foot and tried to buy a shirt and some shoes from area residents, Dixon said. 
The second man, identified as Jose Ledesma, 23, also of Van Nuys, was still at 
large Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Balanos-Cazares had been guarding McGuigan since about 8 a.m., when a tire on 
the men's car went flat on their flight north, Dixon said. He threw a gun away 
as he ran from authorities, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, it was a dope deal that went bad," Dixon said. He would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
McGuigan was treated and released at Kern County Medical Center in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Kern County sheriff's deputies have turned the investigation over to Los 
Angeles police, who are searching for Ledesma, authorities said.

COUNTY TO PAY BUILDER OF JAIL $2.2 MILLION TO SETTLE LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors agreed Tuesday to pay $2.2 million to settle a 
lawsuit brought by the company that built the newest jail at the Peter J. 
Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
The Boise, Ida.-based contractor, Morrison-Knudsen, contends that the county 
was responsible for delays in completing the 1,600-bed medium-security facility 
that ultimately required the company to devote more time and work to the 
project. The $16-million jail was finished in October, 1987, 96 days behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison-Knudsen blamed the delay on faulty designs and claimed that the county 
owed it $7 million more for additional labor and overhead not included in the 
original contract. A lawsuit to recoup the money was filed in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to supervisors last month, Internal Services Department Director 
William F. Stewart said a detailed analysis by his department, a construction 
management consultant, county counsel and a private law firm representing the 
county showed that Morrison-Knudsen's claim had some merit. Negotiations to 
settle the lawsuit out of court have been under way for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison-Knudsen's attorney, Jack W. Fleming, could not be reached for comment 
Tuesday, but the report to supervisors notes that both parties agreed to settle 
the case for $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbott, the Internal Services Department's senior deputy director for 
construction, said the design phase of the project, which normally takes up to 
one year, was completed in several weeks because the county was under a court 
order to relieve overcrowding at its downtown Los Angeles jail. 
</P>
<P>
Had more time been available to review the drawings, errors would have been 
found and corrected before the construction phase of the project, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
The design problems were compounded by a change in project managers during the 
third month of construction, Abbott said. The county's original manager died.

BURBANK LOAN PROGRAM IRKS GOLDEN MALL SHOPKEEPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council agreed Tuesday night to provide financial assistance 
to Golden Mall merchants, many of whom say they have lost as much as half of 
their business since construction work began to reopen the mall to vehicle 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the merchants complained that the program was "too little, too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5 to 0 to appropriate $25,000 to fund the low-interest loan 
program. The money is intended to help shopkeepers restock their shelves for 
the Christmas holiday season or to make needed repairs or improvements to their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Mall, which stretches from Olive Avenue to Magnolia Boulevard, is in 
the heart of a downtown area targeted for redevelopment by the city. The mall 
has been closed to traffic since 1967. The $2.1-million street reopening 
project, which began in May, is scheduled to be completed by Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Revitalized Downtown' 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a good program," said Councilman Thomas E. Flavin before the 
vote. "It will provide businesses with an opportunity to upgrade and become 
part of a revitalized downtown." 
</P>
<P>
But several of the 50 merchants along the mall on San Fernando Road said that 
the loan requirements are too stringent and that they will not participate in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to all the people that were originally for a loan program, and not 
a single one is going to take advantage of this particular package," said 
Vernon Michel, owner of Michel's Records and Tapes. "It wouldn't make good 
business sense." 
</P>
<P>
Michel and other merchants said the main problem with the program is that it 
requires that they apply for a minimum loan of $5,000 or a maximum of $10,000, 
to be paid back within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"With a monthly payment of $700 or more, it would be more of a burden than a 
help," Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assistance Plan 
</P>
<P>
Alan Goodstein, vice president of Morey's Shoes, agreed that the assistance 
plan was "too little too late. This was the least they could come up with. They 
don't care about the mall merchants. They just want the big developers to come 
in here, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
City Treasurer Jim Rogers said merchants who want to take advantage of the 
program would be required to apply for a loan from one of eight participating 
banks in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bank approves the loan, we would then buy down the interest rate to 8% 
and pay any loan fees," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
If a loan were not approved, the city would consider providing a guarantee of 
repayment upon review of the borrower's application by the City Treasurer's 
Finance Committee, Rogers said.

SECRET OF DON DIXON GETS OUT AT CHINA CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a less senseless alternate universe, the kids on the street would already be 
whistling Dixon -- Don Dixon, that is, the masterfully tuneful 
singer-songwriter-producer whose blazing appearance at the China Club in 
Hollywood made you wonder just how long he can be kept hidden from the masses. 
Ah, well: If the secret finally got out on the similar John Hiatt (whose "Love 
Gets Strange" was included in the set), it'll get out on Dixon eventually too. 
</P>
<P>
The third time may or may not be the charm, but in any case the bulk of 
Monday's material came from Dixon's third terrific solo album, "EEE" (due out 
later this week). As always, Dixon has the skill to construct immaculate 
bridges, hooks, rhyme schemes, et al., and the passion to make all that care 
seem effortlessly irrelevant. Additionally, this album takes his usual formulas 
-- reference points would be the catchy, compassionate literacy of Elvis 
Costello, lightened by a dollop of Nick Lowe's pungent pure pop for now people 
-- and adds an irresistible wrinkle: horns, horns, horns. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Dixon has picked up a sharp three-piece horn section to play with 
him live, adding parts that range from standard-issue R&amp;B punctuation to 
some "Peter Gunn"-style sliding and riffing to some out-and-out jazz improv. 
And for the first time on tour, he has an entire backup band that's up to the 
fiery challenge of besting the recorded work, with a special nod to 
conga-flogging percussionist Jim Brock. 
</P>
<P>
Also among that band is his wife, Marti Jones, who sang a melting lead on two 
of her own songs. Her sparkling, spouse-ly presence may make fans wonder how 
Dixon can continue to write so many songs from the viewpoint, as he noted, of 
"the Gig Young character in a Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie -- the guy who never 
gets the girl." Here's rooting for Gig to get the audience, if not the 
gal.CHRIS WILLMAN

JAZZ NOTES : TAKING THE A TRAIN TO SANTA BARBARA FESTIVAL WHALUM BENEFIT DUE 
SUNDAY IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in more than five years, Santa Barbara has a jazz festival. 
</P>
<P>
Headlined by saxophonist Stan Getz, the Santa Barbara International Jazz 
Festival kicks off tonight and runs through Saturday, with performances -- by 
such name artists as Getz, pianist David Benoit and conga drummer Poncho 
Sanchez, and such Santa Barbara-area musicians as pianist Debbie Denke and 
flutist Bob Ledner -- in venues all over town. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think I'm totally crazy to try and pull off a festival here, 
but I thought it could be done if it emphasized that Santa Barbara is a 
beautiful place to go," said Jack Butefish, festival director. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to create an atmosphere where jazz is happening all over town, 
including bands in the streets Friday and Saturday, on a big stage in front of 
City Hall, in the nightclubs and the concert halls," said Butefish. 
</P>
<P>
Among the special events will be the Amtrak Jazz Train, which will carry 
festival-goers -- entertained by a jazz trio en route -- from Los Angeles' 
Union Station to Santa Barbara Friday (a return trip is scheduled for Sunday), 
and a jazz club crawl, led by noted KKGO-FM disc jockey Chuck Niles, which will 
take place after Getz's Saturday evening concert. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (800) 321-3378 or (805) 962-0800. 
</P>
<P>
The Boys Club of Pasadena and the MacKenzie-Scott Branch Women's Assn. will 
share the proceeds from the Kirk Whalum Benefit Jazz Concert, scheduled to 
begin at 8 p.m. Sunday at Pasadena City College's Sexton Auditorium. In 
addition to jazz/funk saxophonist Whalum, the bill includes singer Diane 
Reeves, saxmen Gerald Albright and George Howard and an all-star band. 
Information: (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000. 
</P>
<P>
Though Corky Hale is perhaps best known as a jazz harpist, talk to her for a 
few minutes and she will let you know she wears a few other musical hats as 
well. "When I worked at the Cocoanut Grove in the '50s, I played harp with the 
orchestra, flute on the Latin numbers, intermission piano and sang with the big 
band," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her biggest thrills have been as a pianist. "I've played piano for 
everybody," she quipped. Among the singers she has accompanied are Barbra 
Streisand and Billie Holiday, the latter in a two-week stint at Jazz City, the 
popular room at Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue that spotlighted jazz 
greats from Art Blakey to Shelly Manne and Conte Candoli in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Hale can be heard Thursdays in October at Tom Rolla's Gardenia Club in 
Hollywood, backing some of her favorite songwriters -- Hal David (tonight), 
Johnny Mandel, Alan Bergman and the team of Lieber and Stoller. (Mike Stoller 
also happens to be Hale's husband.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have each of the writers do a couple of their songs, and then I'll do 
one," she said. Bassist Herb Mickman and drummer Gene Estes will also be on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Another facet of the show will find Hale doing tunes that she worked on with 
such stars as Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. "I'll talk about the tunes, and 
about how I got to do them. I've done a lot crazy things, and I hope to put 
some of these happenings in my show," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
***** "Messages" (Prestige), from the marvelous-yet-underrecognized saxophonist 
Hank Mobley, is the epitome of a hard-bop recording. This superb 1956 
two-record set (on a single CD) offers a blend of bop classics -- "Bouncing 
With Bud," "52nd Street Theme" -- along with torchy ballads and crackling 
medium and up-tempos, all infused with the bluesy tinge that marked the 
hard-bop genre. Mobley, a master improviser who could weave art and funk into 
sumptuous, melodic cloths, is assisted by trumpet greats Kenny Dorham (who was 
seen a bit in the recently re-released "Dangerous Liaisons 1960"), pianists 
Barry Harris and Walter Bishop, bassist Doug Watkins and drummer Art Taylor. 
This is music that never stops cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Records are rated from one to five stars: ***** means a swinging must-have for 
the jazz lover; * means save your pennies, Benny.

MODERN QUARTET SKIPS FUSION AND SCORES WITH AN OLD FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where is the modern in the Modern Jazz Quartet? 
</P>
<P>
They play jazz -- no doubt on that score; and they are a quartet. How modern 
they are remains subject to question, as the quartet made clear at the 
Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, pianist John Lewis and vibraphonist Milt Jackson, once looked on 
as young radicals in the revolutionary bop band of Dizzy Gillespie, have proved 
beyond question that modernity is not an essential component of their music; on 
the contrary, their aim in recent years has been the conservation of qualities 
all too scarce in the wake of the fusion era. 
</P>
<P>
The values they hold dear are best represented by their collection of tributes 
to Duke Ellington, which took up most of Sunday's program. In addition to 
arrangements inspired by Ellington works of the 1930s and early '40s, there 
were two original tributes: Lewis' "For Ellington," with its sublime evocation 
of the Duke's quasi-gospel mood in his later years, and Jackson's "Maestro 
E.K.E.," a languidly effective theme with easy interplay by Jackson, Lewis and 
bassist Percy Heath. 
</P>
<P>
"Ko-Ko," a minor blues, one of the all-time Ellington masterpieces, came to 
life vividly with an often exact duplication of the original recording. Another 
partial blues, "Sepia Panorama," similarly managed to capture with the four men 
what Ellington had expressed through a 15-piece orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The only flaw in a generally inspired afternoon was the occasionally colorless 
drumming of Connie Kay, whose tendency to underplay now and then weakens the 
impact. On the slower works, however, notably the exquisite "Django" (played as 
an encore), all four men achieved the magic blend that established this group 
back in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz is sometimes called the sound of surprise. What emerges at a Modern Jazz 
Quartet concert is geared not to surprise but to subtlety, serenity and 
sensitivity. The formula still works as well as it did in the formative days 
when this group provided an invaluable alternative in the already hectic world 
of jazz.

'MY REBEL' DEFEATED BY ITS SOAP OPERA PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are several factors that work against Doris Baizley's new play, "My 
Rebel." For one, the A Directors' Theatre production it receives at the Lex 
under the direction of Evelyn Purcell is competent, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
For another, it is a play about events surrounding a group of friends, 
Vietnam-era peace activists. The Vietnam War left a tragic legacy among vets 
who returned to a country that was less than grateful for the pains they took, 
right or wrong. We've all heard about post-traumatic stress syndrome. But the 
legacy among the protesters who stayed home and agitated is fuzzier, less 
chronicled and oddly inglorious. 
</P>
<P>
Life catches up. All those people who were so sure you shouldn't trust anyone 
over 30 grew silent as they slipped past that age themselves. We now have 
return concerts by the middle-aged Who and Ringo Starr. Abbie Hoffman and Huey 
Newton are dead. And the biggest war left is the war on drugs -- and perhaps 
self-involvement. 
</P>
<P>
So any play about the vociferous '60s is fighting an uphill battle. There may 
come a time when the national nostalgia will be fired up again by those 
tumultuous years, but that time isn't now and Baizley's play is not the play to 
inspire it. As a piece of writing, it is not commanding enough to compel real 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma it reports is that of a young protester and Yale dropout, Petey 
(Jamie Younger), scion of upper middle-class country-club types, who decides to 
turn in his peace signs and enlist. Why isn't exactly clear. Pressure from 
Daddy (John Shearin) perhaps, or imagined pressure from Daddy. In any case, 
Daddy and Mommy (Patricia Estrin) seemed pleased that Petey's off to war. Or 
are they? 
</P>
<P>
Again, not clear. They're pleased enough to throw a farewell bash for Petey at 
the country club. It is attended by his Ivy League friends: Lou, an aspiring 
film maker (Dedee Pfeifer); Anne, who works as a counselor and has Quaker 
pacifist beliefs (Sabina Weber); Monk (Todd Merrill), an art student, and 
Petey's girlfriend Mimi (Michelle Joyner), to whom Petey proposes if she'll 
wait. She says she will. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these "friends" disagree with Petey's decision to enlist but don't have 
the honesty or moral fiber to tell him so or stay away. And the poor guy's 
barely set foot on Vietnam soil before Mimi has jumped into bed with Monk. 
</P>
<P>
Mimi and Petey exchange tapes rather than letters -- a convenient device in the 
theater that allows us to hear what they have to say to each other. As Petey's 
declarations of love intensify, Mimi's depression increases, since she's 
apparently not impervious to her duplicity. When Petey's killed, she tailspins. 
</P>
<P>
And so does Petey's mother, who is transformed (not very convincingly) by his 
death into some sort of ardent peace activist while his father becomes a bit of 
a dodderer. By now, the play has turned into major soap opera and nobody -- or 
at least not this writer -- much cares what happens to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
These are all shallow, self-deluded and self-centered individuals who don't 
inspire much feeling of any kind. Baizley has put nothing into this 
dissertation that makes us want to sit up and take notice. 
</P>
<P>
She can do and has done better than this. The piece, like its characters, feels 
faintly self-important. And the bare-minimum production, rather gloomily lit by 
Michael Gilliam, is ultimately enervating. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6760 Lexington Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Sundays, 7 p.m. Indefinitely. Tickets: $12.50-$15; (213) 466-1767).

MUTINY NOT A U.S. OPERATION, BUSH ASSERTS

<P>
President Bush said Tuesday that the failed coup in Panama was not "an American 
operation" but that the Administration supported the aims of the insurgents, 
and the White House said the United States was informed in advance of the 
planned uprising. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, an unusual alliance of Republicans and Democrats criticized 
Bush for failing to order the U.S. military to assist the rebels to overthrow 
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler. 
</P>
<P>
"There were rumors around that this was some American operation, and I can tell 
you that is not true," Bush told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with 
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov. 
</P>
<P>
However, moderates such as Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and Sen. Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and conservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and 
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) joined to attack the Administration for doing too 
little to help the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
Mounting frustration in Congress over the nation's narcotics crisis apparently 
overcame the usual wariness of military intervention in Latin America. Noriega 
is under indictment in Florida on charges of drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you have brave people in Panama trying to rid themselves of a drug dealer 
and thug who's taken over their country; and for the United States, with all of 
our strength and force and all of our belief in democracy, to stand by just two 
miles away as the crow flies and do nothing and allow these people to fail, 
personally I think is wrong," said Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after receiving a CIA briefing on the failed coup, Boren 
said, "Today we had an insurrection of some very courageous people . . . and 
the United States did nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Boren, who opposed a Reagan Administration plan for covert action against 
Noriega, said Bush should have ordered U.S. military intervention while the 
rebels held the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missed Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Hyde, who is the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said 
Bush missed a perfect opportunity to have the kind of success in Panama that 
Reagan had in Grenada, where U.S. troops and Caribbean allies unseated a 
socialist regime. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to be a golden opportunity to resolve the Noriega problem," Hyde 
said. "We had a legitimate justification (to move in militarily). We should 
have taken advantage of it -- exploited it." 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, "I would hope 
that the President would have some plans to use military action, but I know of 
none." 
</P>
<P>
Helms startled fellow senators Tuesday night during a session on anti-drug 
legislation when he introduced an amendment that would authorize Bush to use 
U.S. armed forces to remove Noriega from power and bring him to the United 
States to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said his sources had told him that at a crucial moment during the 
abortive coup in Panama, the United States had rejected a request for military 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Keystone Cops' 
</P>
<P>
"We were like a bunch of Keystone cops bumping into each other," Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment he introduced read: 
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President is authorized to use 
the armed forces of the United States to secure the removal of Gen. Manuel 
Antonio Noriega from his illegal control of the Republic of Panama in order to 
(a) bring Gen. Noriega to trial in the United States under the terms of his 
February, 1988, indictments on drug-trafficking charges, (b) protect the Panama 
Canal treaties of 1978, (c) protect the people of Panama in their struggle to 
rid their nation of the brutal oppression of the Noriega regime and (d) restore 
a constitutional government to Panama." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate postponed a vote on Helms' proposal until today at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said he is concerned that Helms' amendment 
could give the President the power to declare war without congressional 
approval. "I am reluctant to give what appears to be a blank check," Biden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Helms said he was ready for a vote and was not delaying the work 
of the Senate. Biden replied: "The senator has not tied up the Senate tonight, 
but he clearly has confounded it." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before it became clear that the coup against Noriega had failed, Bush 
appealed directly to Panamanian soldiers to support the uprising. Mindful that 
the American Cable News Network is widely watched in Panama, the President 
said: "We have no argument with the Panamanian Defense Forces. . . . We've had 
good relations with the Panamanian Defense Forces, and our argument has been . 
. . with Mr. Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government received 
"advanced reports and rumblings" that a coup was imminent, but he said the 
United States was not asked for help. A congressional source said the 
Administration was informed at least as early as Monday of coup plans. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional source said the Administration "encouraged the Panamanians to 
believe that they would have military backup from the United States. . . . They 
were led to believe that they'd have military support." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials refused to answer the question of whether the United 
States had encouraged the coup, either explicitly or tacitly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to dodge that issue," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States has long sought 
Noriega's overthrow, although he said Washington did not "instigate" the coup 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Panama Canal treaties, the United States maintains a garrison of 
about 12,000 troops in Panama, far outnumbering the Panamanian military. 
However, the Pentagon has been careful not to involve the U.S. forces in 
Panama's internal politics, in part to avoid alarming the governments of other 
nations that grant base rights to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although a bipartisan group on Capitol Hill said the Administration should have 
used troops because of the drug charges against Noriega, other lawmakers from 
both parties disagreed. For instance, California Rep. Anthony C. Beilensen 
(D-Beverly Hills), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he 
doubted that the United States could have done anything to assure the victory 
of the coup. 
</P>
<P>
"The President doesn't have many options," he said. "He's not doing very much, 
but he couldn't do very much." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who has previously criticized U.S. policy 
toward Panama, said he would not have supported intervention by U.S. forces. 
"Certainly to say we should have flown into the middle of a fire-fight -- 
that's not something I think we could do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a frequent critic of the Administration's 
Latin American policy, praised Bush for his restraint. Speaking at a press 
conference when it appeared that the coup had succeeded, Dodd said: "There were 
those who advocated that the United States take unilateral action. President 
Bush rejected those suggestions, worked through the Organization of American 
States, worked through regional governments and built the kind of support that 
isolated Gen. Noriega and that ultimately, it appears, caused his downfall." 
</P>
<P>
Although Fitzwater denied any U.S. military involvement, he said the troops of 
the U.S. Southern Command stationed in Panama "took steps to protect U.S. 
citizens, property and treaty rights under the Panama Canal treaty." 
</P>
<P>
"We had helicopters that were in the air observing, and we had some troops 
around one of the causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the Administration has been demanding Noriega's ouster, often 
suggesting that the Panamanian military should do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in an interview with reporters aboard Air Force One on May 13, encouraged 
the army to overthrow Noriega, saying: "I would love to see them get him out. . 
. . The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of 
these Doberman thugs (a reference to the nickname given Panamanian riot-control 
troops). That's what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, after the Administration was informed of coup planning, according to 
some sources, Bernard Aronson, the State Department's top Latin American 
specialist, hinted at Panamanian military action. 
</P>
<P>
"We are told that opposition within the army is developing, and we hope that 
will lead to the restoration of democracy," he told a group of reporters 
Monday. "When that set of pressures will reach a critical mass that will have 
an effect, I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure of the coup, the White House said the United States will 
keep the pressure on Noriega and continue to try to bring him to trial on 
drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's changed," Fitzwater said. "Everything remains the same. We'll 
continue to press for Noriega's removal." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Abrams, chief Latin American specialist in the Reagan Administration, 
said: "I think you can make a good case that we should have pushed and tipped 
the balance. I think it was a mistake under the Reagan Administration (not to 
use U.S. force), and it's still a mistake today. There has been a great 
reluctance to use American power against Noriega. I think that's one of the 
reasons Noriega is still there after a year and a half of our jabbering at 
him."

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
WE CURSE THE TRAFFIC, BUT WON'T GIVE UP OUR CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bumper to bumper beneath a beige sky, swearing we'll move away tomorrow, 
shaking our fists and brandishing our fingers, we Southern Californians keep on 
driving all the same, captives of a car culture we can't quite renounce. 
</P>
<P>
The spell may be wearing off. We don't like what the automobile is doing to the 
environment. Many of us -- over 40% -- believe that cars have ruined Los 
Angeles. A third of us have considered moving away from the region because of 
traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
We don't hide our aggravation. Nearly 40% of us say we have made indecent 
gestures while driving. One in 10 of us has argued with another driver during 
the last year. When we get in accidents -- and 13% of us say we have this year 
-- most (65%) blame it on the other guy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, we are a long way from giving up on the car. It's been a year or more 
since the great majority of drivers (83%) rode a bus. Less than a third of us 
say we would make frequent use of mass transit if it were available, and a big 
majority (84%) still drive to work alone. 
</P>
<P>
Most households in the region have at least two cars, and almost half of all 
higher-income homes -- those making over $40,000 per year -- own at least three 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Those are some of the results of a Times poll that asked people in Southern 
California a variety of questions about their cars, their driving habits and 
their attitudes about driving in general. Conducted by Times Poll Director I. 
A. Lewis, the survey interviewed 2,032 Southern California residents last week. 
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what their cars meant to them, the great majority of people made 
positive statements. Many said their cars give them the freedom to do what they 
want. Others said they could count on their cars to take them where they needed 
to go, and some people said their cars are a reflection of themselves and their 
life styles. 
</P>
<P>
While some of us are quite happy with the cars we drive, owning a Mercedes is 
on top of most people's auto wish list. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that cars reflect their owners' personalities in several ways. 
About 11% of the people polled have pet names for their cars. There are no 
runaway favorites, but "Betsy," "Sweetheart," "Beast" and "Bossmobile" are 
among the more popular names. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians drive an average of 117 miles a week, the poll found. 
More than 37% of them say commuting time has increased, and three out of four 
say that traffic in their neighborhood is congested. 
</P>
<P>
A few drivers admit that they can pose a danger on the road. Seven percent say 
they have driven after drinking too much during the last year. One out of every 
20 drivers carries a gun in the car, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Given the traffic conditions, Southern Californians are, not surprisingly, an 
impatient bunch of drivers. Virtually everyone admits to driving over the speed 
limit at least some of the time. 
</P>
<P>
One of five drivers admits to running a red light during the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about their pet driving peeves, the largest group (28%) mentioned 
slow drivers and an equal number complained about people who turn without 
signaling. 
</P>
<P>
It is the more affluent driver -- the one making upwards of $40,000 -- who 
feels the pressure of congestion most and who has thought most about moving 
away. Moreover, it is the affluent male driver who is more likely to represent 
a menace on the road. The poll suggests that the male driver who makes more 
than $40,000 a year is more likely to carry a gun in his car, drink and drive, 
to speed, run red lights, get in arguments with other drivers, make indecent 
gestures and become involved in accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the cars they own and the cars they would like to own, 15% 
said they already owned the car of their dreams. But most people long for what 
they don't have. Mercedes topped the wish list, followed by Jaguar, Cadillac 
and Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
If cars are us, if each make and model is a reflection of its owner, it seems a 
fair question to ask what is a Jeep owner like, or how is the owner of a Toyota 
different from a Ford owner? 
</P>
<P>
Most Jeep owners tend to be Anglo men living in the suburbs. Most of them are 
under 45 and make more than $40,000 a year. More of them than not describe 
themselves as political conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
If the Jeep looks more like a recreational vehicle than a town car, its owners, 
by and large, say they are more interested in doing things that give them 
personal satisfaction than they are in working hard and doing what is expected 
of them. Many Jeep owners even sound a bit guilty when talking about 
themselves, many saying that they are too materialistic. 
</P>
<P>
As for owners of Fords and Toyotas, the poll shows them to be two distinct 
breeds. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Ford owners describe themselves as blue-collar workers and high 
school graduates who make between $20,000 and $40,000 a year. Most are married. 
Many are over 65 years old. A great many of them say they are not interested in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota owners, on the other hand, tend to be younger, single, and more affluent 
-- making at least $40,000 a year. Many of their jobs are administrative in 
nature. Discussing their goals in life, they say that achieving personal 
satisfaction is more important than working hard. 
</P>
<P>
More Southern Californians buy new cars than used -- by a margin of 55% to 41%. 
The remainder drive leased cars. People here prefer foreign to domestic cars by 
about a 7% margin. Cars from Japan and Germany are the most popular, according 
to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The most commonly owned cars in Southern California, according to the poll, are 
the Honda Accord, the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla and Celica. The most 
widely owned American-made car in Southern California is the Ford Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, buyers spend just under $10,000 for cars, new and used, 
according to the poll. Nearly half keep their cars for six years or longer. 
</P>
<P>
Car dealers did not fare well in the poll. Asked to rank them for honesty and 
ethical standards, drivers put car dealers, along with insurance agents, at the 
bottom of a list of nine occupations. Ranked first were doctors followed by 
policemen, druggists, businessmen, lawyers and reporters (tied), and real 
estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
While most people would like to own a fancier car, the majority have not been 
swept up in the latest gadget craze. 
</P>
<P>
Only 4% of drivers have telephones in their cars, and while another 31% said 
they would like to have them, 64% indicated no interest in car phones. 
</P>
<P>
The fuzzy dice fad has a small following. Eight percent of the drivers say they 
have some sort of ornament in their cars. A larger minority, 18%, say their 
cars sport bumper stickers. Eleven percent of drivers say they customized their 
cars. Oversized tires and souped-up engines are the most popular modifications. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen percent of the people polled have car alarms; 23% have had their cars 
broken into. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of men and women polled (90%) said they pump their own gas 
and most said they can perform routine maintenance chores. However, 6% said 
they couldn't pump their own gas, and 29% said they don't know how to change a 
tire. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain what a carburetor does, 82% of the men and only 36% of the 
women interviewed knew the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Although the biggest plurality, 36%, said they worry more about bad drivers 
than anything else on the road, 12% said they worry more about breaking down. 
There may be a good reason for that. Some drivers apparently are not accustomed 
to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, it has been a year or more since 20% of the drivers have 
walked as far as four city blocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A PROFILE OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DRIVER 
</P>
<P>
Each percentage point represents about 130,000 Southern Californians. For 
example, 8%, or about a million adults, have ornaments such as fuzzy dice or 
booties hanging from their rear view mirrors. For other revealing statistics

EAST GERMANS ALLOW 10,000 MORE TO LEAVE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany imposed a ban Tuesday on unrestricted travel to Czechoslovakia but 
at the same time agreed to allow more than 10,000 of its nationals in Prague to 
leave for the West. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on travel without special permission was ordered after several hundred 
East Germans broke through police lines in order to get into the West German 
Embassy in Prague. Many were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the East German decision to allow more people to flee to the West was 
announced here by Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But 
the first train for East German refugees was apparently delayed Tuesday night 
and is not expected to leave Prague until this morning and reach the city of 
Hof in West Germany tonight. 
</P>
<P>
He said the East German decision applied to about 4,700 East Germans in the 
embassy building and about 6,000 more on the grounds outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident we will not be confronted with any stragglers," Seiters said, 
referring to the East Germans who failed to get on board the special refugee 
trains that arrived in West Germany from Prague Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 East Germans in Warsaw, also seeking to flee to the West, were 
expected to be given permission to leave as well, probably within the next few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters said the East German government had agreed "on humanitarian grounds" to 
allow the refugees to join their 5,500 countrymen who entered West Germany from 
Prague on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 800 East Germans came into West Germany from Warsaw over the 
weekend, by special train through East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters said that Chancellor Kohl had been notified of the East German decision 
in a telephone conversation with Czechoslovak Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to express our great relief at this humanitarian decision, 
especially on behalf of the many small children and women," Seiters said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher 
canceled a trip to Luxembourg and a meeting of European Community foreign 
ministers in order to keep abreast of events in the refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany prepared the ground for Tuesday's decision by declaring that its 
nationals could no longer travel to Czechoslovakia without special permission. 
</P>
<P>
This temporarily solved the problem of East Germans crowding into the West 
German Embassy in Prague as a first step to the West. But in the longer term, 
diplomatic analysts here said, the move could only compound East Germany's 
problem, because the East German people are bound to chafe under the curb on 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really going to feel imprisoned," one analyst said, "and this will 
make them that much more eager to leave for good." 
</P>
<P>
Baerbel Bohley, a founder of the New Forum reform group in East Berlin, said, 
"This will make the pressure greater still." She said the restrictions on 
travel were one of the main reasons East Germans are fleeing their country. 
</P>
<P>
The ban will also make it much more difficult for East Germans to reach 
Hungary, where the government opened its western border Sept. 11, since the 
usual route to Hungary is through Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Erich Honecker, the East German leader, said in a speech to a group of war 
veterans in East Berlin: "People in West Germany believe they can turn East 
Germany upside down with a comprehensive attack. The more insolently somebody 
breaks his word when carrying out humanitarian acts, the clearer our response 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
This was a reference to East German charges that West Germany had gone back on 
its word to shut down the refugee operation after Saturday's departures. West 
German officials insist that there was no such agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker said in his speech that socialism under a Communist regime has brought 
"happiness for our people and the people of Europe," and he concluded: "East 
Germany is and remains a firm barrier against all attempts to alter the outcome 
of World War II and postwar development and the geopolitical realities of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the railroad cars crowded with East German refugees were barely out of 
Prague on Saturday night when additional refugees began arriving at the West 
German Embassy there. They continued to scale the fence enclosing the embassy 
grounds throughout Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, although many of them reportedly 
have been attacked by Czechoslovak policemen. 
</P>
<P>
Once they arrive in West Germany, the East Germans enjoy the same status as the 
citizens there, since Bonn recognizes only a single German citizenship. There 
they are put up in temporary reception centers that have been set up around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's unexpected accord on new refugee departures came after a day of 
charges and countercharges. East Germany and Czechoslovakia both accused West 
Germany of breaking its word to close its mission in Prague once the East 
Germans were moved out. 
</P>
<P>
When the new East German arrivals in Prague were allowed into the West German 
Embassy and grounds, the East German government accused West Germany of a 
"gross breach of trust." 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, officials said they had ordered the embassy in Prague to close its 
doors, but only temporarily, as a "technical" measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We only suspended admission," an official said. "It represents no change in 
our policy of accepting all Germans." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Czechoslovak government, Miroslav Pavel, criticized the 
West German decision to let in more East Germans. He said their presence in 
Prague was "seriously violating public order." 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, meanwhile, Kohl was trying without success to telephone Honecker in 
order to discuss the crisis. He was told that Honecker would not be available 
until after Saturday, when East Germany will celebrate its 40th anniversary as 
a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the call was put through, and an agreement was reached on allowing 
more departures. 
</P>
<P>
The scene at the embassy in Prague was chaotic, diplomats there reported by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more than 5,000 people with only eight toilets, which are stuffed 
up," an official in Bonn said. "We are worried about disease breaking out. 
There are a large number of young children among the refugees." 
</P>
<P>
West German officials complained that the Czechoslovak government refused to 
relieve the "intolerable situation" by accommodating the refugee overflow in 
buildings outside the embassy grounds -- as the Polish government had done in 
Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross workers described conditions at the embassy as much worse than before 
Saturday's departures, mainly because of the presence of about 1,000 children 
and the shortage of sanitary facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Women and children were sleeping in the baroque old palace that houses the 
embassy, and the men shared about 45 tents set up outside. 
</P>
<P>
Some East Germans used ropes to scramble over the rear wall into the embassy 
grounds. Others entered the U.S. Embassy next door and climbed a wall into the 
West German Embassy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd in the embassy broke into cheers when they heard the news that they 
were to be allowed to go to the West. People standing out in front promptly 
began looking for buses to take them to the railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
The trains will pass through East Germany, diplomats here said, as a 
face-saving measure for East Germany. This will allow the East German regime to 
maintain that the refugees were expelled as traitors. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans who arrived in the refugee camp at Giessen in West Germany on 
Sunday said that East German security police had confiscated their documents as 
they passed through. 
</P>
<P>
The gates to the West opened for East Germans not long after the first of the 
year when the regime decided to grant more official emigration visas. The flow 
was accelerated in May, when the Hungarian government decided to dismantle the 
fence that marks its border with Austria. It became a flood after Sept. 11, 
when the Hungarian government announced that East Germans would not need exit 
visas to cross into Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, about 110,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany, 
two-thirds of them legally and the rest illegally. To this figure will be added 
the thousands that arrived last weekend from Warsaw and Prague -- and thousands 
more in the next day or two.

BLACKS FACE GRIM FUTURE IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the black political community in Los Angeles, the future became grimly 
obvious in the autumn of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The city's senior black leadership had gathered to anoint the next of the 
chosen, the politician they hoped would succeed retiring David S. Cunningham 
Jr. in the city's perennially powerful 10th District City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
The selection was pivotal. The council's two other blacks -- physically frail 
Gilbert Lindsay and Robert Farrell, soon to be targeted by a recall effort -- 
held tenuously onto power. A unanimous selection could have installed the 
eventual successor to Mayor Tom Bradley as the city's foremost black 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felt Spurned 
</P>
<P>
But discord ravaged the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Cunningham endorsed one candidate. Many women supported another. 
Some politicians backed former State Sen. Nate Holden, who eventually would 
win. Young blacks, ignored by their elders, felt spurned. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an air of distrust," Bradley recalled. "We could not get a 
successful coalition." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the schisms have intensified. Politically, the black community in 
Los Angeles is riddled with divisions, its once-certain unity split between 
honored elders and anxious young, between the sometimes contradictory ambitions 
of women and of men, between traditionalists and those who seek a new black 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
While Bradley, now 71, serves what most believe will be his final term, no 
dominant black political figure has arisen to eventually assume the mayor's 
mantle of leadership. Many black activists in Los Angeles worry openly about 
holding onto other black-controlled seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Confluence 
</P>
<P>
The divisions come at a critical confluence, as the community confronts the 
rising political surge of Latinos and Asians and copes with the 
conflict-of-interest controversy clouding Bradley, who for 16 years has towered 
as a symbol of black political success. 
</P>
<P>
The concerns of the city's blacks are far from isolated. Indeed, they flow from 
a troubling national phenomenon: Despite the emergence of some powerful black 
politicians, the promise of a generation ago -- a heady time when desire and 
opportunity conspired to fling open the doors to public office -- has hardly 
been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Harris, a 32-year-old Los Angeles native regarded as one of the brightest 
stars of the incoming generation of black political activists, describes the 
future bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
"Black elected officials are an endangered species," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions across the nation, blacks ushered into office by the civil 
rights movement have grown old in elective jobs that have proven thus far to be 
dead ends. Young, politically active blacks, frustrated that their elders have 
not moved up, are increasingly looking to challenge them for primacy. Latinos 
and Asians increasingly pose a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the number of black elected officials has grown each year since 
1970 -- but the rate of increase has slowed to a crawl. In California, despite 
the prominence of elected blacks such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, blacks 
hold 1.6% of elected offices, well below their nearly 8% share of the 
population. Black officials themselves see little chance of mounting a 
successful run at statewide office, and few are optimistic that their numbers 
will increase significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a surge, we reached a plateau -- and we've leveled off for some period 
of time," Bradley, now in his fifth mayoral term, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
To Harris and many others, the only hope for a resurgence of black politicians 
comes in a delicate arrangement of coalitions between blacks and other 
minorities -- and an unprecedented effort by black politicians to run for 
office in areas dominated by white voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historic Reluctance 
</P>
<P>
But that will require both an easing of racial tensions and a complete reversal 
of white voters' historic reluctance to support the ambitions of blacks. Harris 
recently confronted a reminder of just how long the odds are: 
</P>
<P>
The airport shuttle bus eased up to a Century City office tower where Harris, 
an elegantly turned-out senior executive for the California State Bar Assn., a 
graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall law school and a seasoned alumnus of 
myriad political campaigns, was to attend a meeting. A traffic jam marred the 
tower's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle bus driver, a white, remarked on his passenger's race: "Now that 
you're here, I guess all those cars can get parked." 
</P>
<P>
For blacks in Los Angeles, the roster of current black elected officials reads 
like a tribute to the elections of the 1970s, testimony to how much was 
accomplished then -- and how little things have changed since. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, most of the black state and high-ranking city officials are in 
their 50s -- at least. Councilman Gilbert Lindsay is 88; U.S. Rep. Augustus 
Hawkins is 81; Bradley is 71. Councilman Nate Holden is 61 and Rep. Mervyn 
Dymally is 63. Locally based legislators Bill Greene, Teresa Hughes, Willard 
Murray, Diane Watson, Maxine Waters and Julian Dixon range from 51 to 58. 
</P>
<P>
Among the politicians frequently mentioned as contenders for Bradley's mayoral 
job, in contrast, are 37-year-old Michael Woo, 40-year-old Zev Yaroslavsky, 
41-year-old Gloria Molina, 46-year-old Richard Alatorre -- all members of the 
City Council -- and 39-year-old City Atty. James K. Hahn. Each represents a 
younger generation and other political constituencies -- Asian, Jewish, Latino 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
There is no widespread discontent with the black leadership simply because of 
their age. But many politically active blacks are concerned that -- without an 
infusion of youth -- other groups represented by younger and more dynamic 
politicians will move to the forefront. According to blacks, challenges to the 
elders have thus far been forestalled by the black community's loyalty to its 
political trailblazers. 
</P>
<P>
That loyalty and sentiment has masked a growing ineffectiveness on the part of 
some senior black politicians, said one member of the city's black political 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
"The community pays a tremendous price for sentimentality," he added, echoing 
the private concerns of many of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
If many of the blacks now in office are troubled at their difficulty in moving 
up the political ladder, young blacks who have been waiting on the sidelines 
for their chance are even more frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Choice 
</P>
<P>
One young political aspirant cites a local commandment: "Thou shalt not 
criticize, nor worse yet run against, an incumbent in the black community." 
With the logjam, though, some young blacks say they have no choice but to 
challenge their elders at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
"The joke around the country is that California has the oldest black elected 
leadership -- once you get into office, you die in office. It's guaranteed," 
said 35-year-old Inglewood Councilman Daniel Tabor, the first vice president of 
the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials. 
</P>
<P>
Tabor tried to compete and felt the consequences. In 1988, he challenged Curtis 
Tucker for the state Assembly seat that the 70-year-old Tucker had held for 14 
years. Tabor lost in a battle punctuated by Tucker's vows of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tabor vowed, "There are going to be skirmishes, maybe even wars within 
the African-American community for political leadership. You begin to wonder, 
'How are you going to do this peacefully?' and I just don't see a peaceful 
solution. We need new, aggressive thinking . . . but unless we take the people 
out who are already there, we're not going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
The next race likely to attract the younger generation will be an expected 1991 
clash between two blacks -- Councilman Robert Farrell and challenger Kerman 
Maddox -- for the seat Farrell has held since 1975. In late 1987, Maddox helped 
lead what proved to be an unsuccessful recall effort against Farrell, whom he 
criticized as not responsive to the community's concerns. While Farrell is only 
51, he carries the support of older black leaders, who were angered by the 
35-year-old Maddox's recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maddox, "this tremendous gap" has emerged between his generation 
of politically involved blacks and their older counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us feel, 'How much longer do we have to wait before we get an 
opportunity? How much longer will Gil Lindsay be there? How much longer for Gus 
Hawkins?' " 
</P>
<P>
David S. Cunningham III, a Los Angeles attorney and son of the former 
councilman, is less inclined than Maddox to chastise older politicians. Still, 
he said wryly: "Martin Luther King at 26 was ready for a leadership position. 
Unfortunately, if we had someone like that today, he might be confronted with 
the response, 'You're much too young and your ideas are sort of radical.' " 
</P>
<P>
The younger generation is banking that conditions in the black community have 
deteriorated to the point where loyalty to the elders might be discarded. The 
younger blacks stress a two-pronged approach on issues: More emphasis must be 
placed on black entrepreneurship and economic development in the inner city, 
and black officials at all governmental levels must work together to solve 
problems such as drug use and gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Liberally Oriented Leanings 
</P>
<P>
But the young -- like their elders -- recoil from being defined solely by 
inner-city issues, and in many ways they share the same liberally oriented 
leanings of their forebears. 
</P>
<P>
"I care about the environment; I care about public schools, not because I can't 
afford private schools," said Los Angeles lawyer Cynthia McClain-Hill, one of a 
group of young black professionals working as fund raisers and advisers for 
black politicians. "I'm concerned about oil drilling because I like the beach a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
To the young, the entrenched politicians have prevented a growth in political 
activism among poorer blacks by failing to rally voters with registration 
drives and the like. They also criticize the elders for failing to groom 
replacements with ties to the poorer communities and of refusing to work 
together to benefit the poor. 
</P>
<P>
To the old, the younger generation has moved so quickly to trade its education 
for personal financial gain that it has lost sight of fellow blacks who have 
not made it. Few of the young, compared to past generations, have dedicated 
themselves to public service, the elders say. The elders look to the youthful 
ambitions with a mix of offhanded disdain -- and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the old guard's a little long in the tooth, they have not become 
politically senile," said the Rev. Cecil L. Murray, the senior minister at 
First A.M.E. Church, the oldest black congregation in the city. "The danger is 
if they (the challengers) divide the black electorate. . . . It frightens me, 
but as I look at reality I see the division will cause us to lose some 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Concern 
</P>
<P>
Losing territory is of sharp concern. Blacks are generally under-represented as 
it is, and like all political minorities have more confidence in 
representatives who share their background than in those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
The division between generations comes into stark relief in the persons of 
Almena and Melanie Lomax, two members of a highly political Los Angeles family. 
Almena Lomax, who admits to being more than 70 when it comes to age but loses 
her candor there, remains optimistic about the chances for black politicians 
overall. And she dismisses entirely the notions that young leadership is needed 
for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne Feinstein -- she's no ingenue," Lomax said, referring to the former San 
Francisco mayor and current Democratic gubernatorial candidate, who is 56. "Why 
do we have to have somebody under age 45?" 
</P>
<P>
But to her daughter Melanie Lomax, a 38-year-old attorney and former general 
counsel for the local NAACP, the emergence of younger leaders armed with a 
newly sculpted, economics-dominated black agenda is essential. Without them, 
she characterizes the chances for black political success as "bleak." 
</P>
<P>
"She likes to remind me of the accomplishments of her generation," Melanie 
Lomax said of her mother. "I acknowledge all her generation has done, but it's 
time for a new generation. I tell her, 'It's time for the second revolution.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Almena Lomax's younger days, when the civil rights movement suffused the 
black community with unity, the way to political prominence was clear and 
alliances were simplified: blacks and Jews worked together, their efforts 
uncomplicated by the relatively small population of Latinos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Mounted 
</P>
<P>
Propelled by the civil rights struggle and in particular the landmark Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, the numbers of black elected officials mounted in the 
1970s, in Los Angeles and elsewhere. In California, Wilson Riles won election 
as state schools superintendent and Mervyn Dymally moved from the state Senate 
to the lieutenant governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, some who already held office, such as Bradley, moved up. Others who 
today serve as the core of black leadership -- Rep. Julian Dixon, State Sen. 
Diane Watson and Assemblywomen Maxine Waters, Teresa Hughes and Gwen Moore -- 
won elective office. 
</P>
<P>
But the last major shift upward came a decade ago, in 1978, when 
then-Assemblyman Dixon ran successfully for Congress, Watson won the Senate 
seat, and Moore captured the Assembly position. And at those levels, it has 
turned out, they stayed. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the 10th District contest, one political consultant said, 
"there's been a lid on political opportunity in Southern California for 
virtually a decade. . . . There's been no turnover, no deaths, no moving up." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are varied. Across the nation, the close of the 1970s ushered in a 
wave of conservativism that swept Ronald Reagan and others into prominence. 
Democratic politicians felt the force of the conservative onslaught -- perhaps 
none more so than blacks, who for many whites had come to personify liberal 
politics and bygone issues. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, when Watson won election to the Los Angeles city school board, the 
debate over school busing was in full flower. She attributes much of her 
political prominence in those days to the integration battle, and the fact that 
she alone "looked like the litigants. . . . Here I am, black, and I'm defending 
all these little black children." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she said in an interview in her Sacramento office, "there's more interest 
in economic development than there is in civil rights. . . . Integration is no 
longer an issue. The issues have changed." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, nationally as well as locally, politics became a more 
expensive exercise, giving an edge to incumbents -- who overwhelmingly are 
white. The power of incumbency is particularly strong in the absence of a 
potent opposition force, such as the political machines that have guided events 
in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a structure, according to Lorenzo Morris, an expert in black 
politics from Washington's Howard University, Los Angeles and California veered 
to "the politics of personality." Such a system, he said, benefits a central 
figure such as Bradley or Assemblywoman Waters, but does little to pull forward 
succeeding generations of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Morris contrasts the lack of structure today with circumstances at the height 
of the civil rights movement, when organized groups such as the Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Council, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
and the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People "socialized the 
people into political action." While the latter two groups -- and another black 
community power base, the church -- still exist, black officials say they have 
far less pull than a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have been disenfranchised of a political structure," Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest barrier to blacks in politics, as in all fields of endeavor, has 
been the lingering specter of racism. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's 1982 gubernatorial campaign made an indelible impression on black 
politicians. With money and prominent Establishment politicians behind him, 
Bradley came within 52,295 votes of defeating Republican George Deukmejian -- 
out of 7.5 million votes cast. A host of polls found that from 5% to 15% of the 
voters -- well over the margin -- refused to vote for Bradley because of his 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley attributes his loss not to racism but to a surge in voting by gun 
advocates angered by his support of a gun control measure on the ballot. But 
most other black leaders disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Political scientists state flatly that, given racism, Bradley's electoral 
success in a white-dominated city is exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Bradley, the state's most prominent black politicians have gained 
clout by working up the leadership ladder, as opposed to winning over the 
electorate. Assembly Speaker Brown and Congressman Dixon, chairman of the House 
ethics committee, are frequently cited examples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electoral Success 
</P>
<P>
Figures gathered last year by the Joint Center for Political Studies, a 
Washington institute that researches black political issues, show that 
electoral success for blacks thus far has been largely limited to 
black-dominated districts. There are no black governors or U.S. senators, and 
only two of the 23 blacks in Congress -- one of them Ron Dellums of Oakland -- 
represent white-majority districts. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top 12 cities represented by black mayors -- as measured by city 
population -- all but Los Angeles are at least 40% black. The number of black 
mayors of cities with populations over 50,000 decreased from 34 in 1987 to 28 
in 1988. All were replaced by whites. A UC Berkeley survey shows that in recent 
elections, black mayors across the country won 7% to 20% of the white vote -- 
again far less than the level Bradley has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no real progress in blacks getting elected outside of black 
districts," said Bruce Cain, associate director of UC Berkeley's Institute for 
Government Studies. "The Bradley phenomenon, the (Wilson) Riles phenomenon, is 
still fairly isolated." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 6,829 blacks in office as of 1988, by the Joint Center's count, 
were in municipal and school board jobs that politicians of any race first 
seek. But blacks increasingly are finding that there is less chance of upward 
movement for them than their white peers, political scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason you see black mayors in so long is they really can't use it as a 
springboard," said Charles Henry, associate professor of Afro-American studies 
at Berkeley. "It's sort of on the top of the ladder for them."

REPUBLICAN PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATE WINS SEAT IN 76TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tricia Hunter, a Republican who bucked party leaders by taking a pro-choice 
stand on abortion, Tuesday won a special state Assembly contest. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, a 37-year-old cardiac nurse from Bonita, was followed by GOP write-in 
candidate Dick Lyles, who campaigned against abortion rights. Trailing far 
behind were Democrat Jeannine Correia, also a pro-choice candidate, and a 
second anti-abortion candidate, Republican Kirby Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
The election fills the unexpired term of the late Bill Bradley (R-San Marcos) 
in the 76th District, which includes parts of San Diego and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign's framework was constructed over the summer when the U.S. Supreme 
Court gave states new authority to restrict abortions. With Hunter's pro-choice 
position setting up a showdown between her and five anti-abortion Republicans, 
the otherwise obscure race attracted nationwide attention as one of the first 
tests of the political fallout from the court's July decision. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter won the August primary with a scant 197-vote margin over Lyles, setting 
up a runoff with Democrat Correia. Lyles, a 42-year-old Poway businessman, 
immediately launched a write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 55%-32% registration edge, victory in the GOP 
primary historically is tantamount to election in the district. 
</P>
<P>
But Lyles' decision to continue his campaign created at least some uncertainty 
about the outcome, raising concern among Republican leaders who feared that his 
write-in candidacy could split the GOP vote. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the runoff, the campaign reflected an inherent irony: Hunter, who 
owed her very presence to the abortion issue's ascendancy in the primary, 
consistently sought to minimize its significance, terming it "only one of many 
issues -- and not even one of the top ones -- people are concerned about." 
Meanwhile, Lyles, who was victimized by the issue in August, fought to maintain 
its pre-eminence in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"In the time it takes you to vote, four babies will die from abortion," warned 
a Lyles brochure that was distributed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A Hunter campaign mailer described Lyles as "the choice of the gun lobby, 
anti-choice extremists and the Sacramento Cavemen," with the last phrase 
referring to arch conservatives in the Republican Assembly caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Correia, meanwhile, acknowledged that her admittedly slim chances hinged on a 
divided GOP vote. A 46-year-old instructor of the developmentally disabled from 
Poway, she often reminded audiences that, while she concurred with Hunter on 
the pivotal abortion issue, the two differed on a wide range of social and 
economic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser, a 29-year-old Lakeside accountant, appeared from the outset to be 
little more than a political footnote in the contest.

EX-NAVY FLIER SAYS HE'S NOT INVOLVED IN ROGERS BOMBING 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. citizen who has emerged as a suspect in the bombing of a van belonging 
to Navy Capt. Will Rogers III has told The Times that although he is being 
closely interrogated by federal law enforcement officials, he is not 
responsible for the March 10 bombing that nearly killed Rogers' wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do it and I don't know who did it," said H. George Marxmiller, a 
former Navy flier and commercial pilot for Eastern Airlines who now lives in 
Lake Oconee, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"But they suspect I know who did it. (Yet) to think I would do something like 
this is utter nonsense. It's so out of character. It doesn't compute." 
</P>
<P>
Marxmiller, who said he is cooperating fully with the investigation, said his 
name surfaced in the case after he contacted the FBI with allegations against 
Rogers, the former skipper of the Vincennes. The Times has been unable to 
substantiate those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Sunday and Monday, Marxmiller and Rogers said that they met only 
once, several years ago, and that they have had no contact since. 
</P>
<P>
"I dimly remember the guy," Rogers said of Marxmiller. "I have no idea why he 
would be involved in this thing. And I have no other comment." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers' wife, Sharon, narrowly escaped injury when the family van she was 
driving exploded at a busy La Jolla intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI took jurisdiction in the case, primarily because officials believed the 
pipe bombing was an act of revenge for Capt. Rogers' order in July, 1988, to 
shoot down what turned out to be an Iranian airliner. All 290 people aboard the 
civilian aircraft were killed. Rogers, who commanded the guided missile cruiser 
Vincennes in the Persian Gulf, was exonerated on grounds that he had reason to 
believe his ship was under attack. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators assumed at first that the van bombing could have been a 
terrorist act committed on U.S. soil. However, that thinking changed in 
September when Marxmiller, 48, surfaced as a potential suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple sources have confirmed that Marxmiller is the leading suspect. Tom 
Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego, has refused to comment 
publicly on the status of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-hour interview, Marxmiller detailed the extent to which federal 
investigators have pored over his life and attempted to determine whether he is 
responsible for the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
He said he took a polygraph test in the summer and was asked whether he was 
involved in the bombing. He said the results were inconclusive. In early 
September, he said, he submitted to a second lie detector test. 
</P>
<P>
In the second examination, he said he believes he passed the first of two key 
questions when he said he did not attach the bomb to the van. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he apparently failed the second key question of whether he had 
planned the bombing or knew who placed the bomb under the van. "That's what 
triggered all this stuff," he said of the FBI's keen interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FBI has asked for his fingerprints and a photograph, and have 
subjected him and a brother to lengthy interviews about their whereabouts up to 
and after the bombing of the van. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in San Diego on Sept. 26 issued a subpoena asking 
Marxmiller to submit two blood samples, in what federal sources said is an 
attempt to compare his blood type with that found in saliva taken from 
cigarette butts found outside the Rogers' home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denied Vendetta 
</P>
<P>
Marxmiller smokes menthol cigarettes, and sources have said menthol cigarette 
butts were found near the Rogers home. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI also has shown interest in the fact that Rogers' name is among three 
dozen people listed as witnesses on behalf of Marxmiller's wife, Rebecca 
Marxmiller, who is suing for divorce in Dekalb County, Ga. Neither George 
Marxmiller nor Rogers had any explanation for why Rogers name was listed as a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
Marxmiller said he has been going through difficult times -- including his 
pending divorce and his decision to honor a March 4 strike at Eastern Airlines. 
But he adamantly denied having any personal vendetta against Capt. Rogers or 
any desire to harm him or his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything against the guy," Marxmiller said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said that the FBI is now checking his alibi. Marxmiller said 
he attended a high school basketball game in Atlanta on March 9. He also 
produced a personal check with his signature that was canceled at an Atlanta 
bank on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Sanders, 48, an Eastern Airlines pilot who lives in Lithonia, Ga., told The 
Times he went to the basketball game with Marxmiller and Marxmiller's son. 
</P>
<P>
"George was with me from approximately 4 p.m. or thereabouts or 4:30 until 
almost midnight on the 9th," Sanders said. "His son spent the night with him at 
George's apartment, after I dropped them off at approximately midnight. So 
George could not have been anywhere but Atlanta on the night of the 9th." The 
bomb went off in San Diego early the next morning and investigators have said 
it probably was planted sometime the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
Added Marxmiller: "The fact is, I wasn't there" in San Diego. "Those are the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Marxmiller said he was last in California on Feb. 24 through 27, when 
he visited friends and a brother who lives near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The brother, who has since moved to Lake Oconee, told The Times that he was 
interviewed by FBI agents late last week. He said he spent more than nine hours 
with agents on Thursday and Friday, and that he also took a polygraph test. He 
said he did not know how the lie detector test turned out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brother Denies Involvement 
</P>
<P>
The brother denied in an interview with The Times that he was involved in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do it," he said. "I didn't have anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that he and his brother voluntarily notified the FBI shows 
that they have nothing to hide. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't gone to them, there'd be no possible way they would have gotten 
on to us," he said. "And then people wonder why people don't get involved." 
</P>

Abrahamson reported from Atlanta while Serrano reported from San Diego.

CATHEDRAL CITY VOTERS REJECT GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Cathedral City voters on Tuesday soundly rejected a proposal to legalize card 
room gambling, spoiling Mayor George Hardie's dream of building a card club and 
resort on land he owns in the desert community. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie, co-owner of a casino in Los Angeles County, attributed the outcome in 
part to residents' "fear of the unknown" and called it "an unfortunate loss" 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have spoken and I accept their decision," the mayor said. "I'm 
going to go on running the city. It's time to put this divisive issue behind 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gambling crusaders, meanwhile, said the results were particularly sweet 
given the well-financed campaign mounted by Hardie and his allies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delirious, we're floating on Cloud 9," said Jack Zachary, a leader of a 
group called No Organized Gambling. "Beating the pants off a powerful man like 
George Hardie is a real job." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial totals showed voters defeating by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 a ballot 
measure that would have repealed an existing ban on card rooms in the city, 
which sits between Palm Springs and Indian Wells. A second measure that would 
have established regulations governing the establishments also was defeated by 
the same margin. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote capped a bitterly contested campaign over perhaps the most 
controversial issue to confront local residents since Cathedral City 
incorporated in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents were led by Hardie, 55, managing partner of the Bicycle Club casino 
in Bell Gardens. Raising nearly $190,000, supporters billed legalized gambling 
as economic salvation for a city struggling to provide services for its 
mushrooming population. 
</P>
<P>
A study done by the city estimated that the Emerald Court Resort -- the 
$25-million card parlor and hotel that Hardie planned to build if the card 
clubs were legalized -- would create 600 jobs and generate $604,000 in annual 
revenue for Cathedral City. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents, who raised about $45,000, predicted that legalizing gambling 
would increase crime, harm property values and deter vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
Inseparable from the debate over gambling was the issue of Hardie's performance 
as mayor. Elected in April, 1988 -- about one year after his proposal to build 
a card club in Cathedral City was rejected by local leaders -- Hardie has been 
attacked by those who say he ran for office merely for personal financial gain. 
The mayor denies the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Card rooms are legal in nearly 120 California cities, but a state law passed in 
1984 greatly limited the spread of such establishments. That law gave the state 
attorney general regulatory power over card parlors and required approval of 
local voters before a club could open. Previously, approval of the City Council 
was all that was needed.

OLD MARRIAGES BLOOM ANEW IN COURT CLERK'S PAPER JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A move to tidy up the Orange County Superior Court clerk's office may cause 
considerable disarray in the lives of nearly a thousand people who thought -- 
mistakenly -- that they were divorced years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk's office is preparing to notify 974 people that their divorces were 
never made final. The unresolved cases were discovered recently in a purge of 
30,000 old divorce cases sparked by a campaign to conserve space in the 
paper-crammed clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to resolve the mysterious divorces that were never made final, clerks are 
now asking: Did the couples change their minds about divorce? Did they simply 
forget to file the final papers? Were they victimized by negligent lawyers? 
Will they be shocked to learn that they are still married? 
</P>
<P>
The missing link in each of the 487 cases is that the couples -- although they 
cleared the second-to-the-last hurdle in the divorce process, the granting of 
an interlocutory judgment -- never completed the final step, the judgment of 
dissolution of a marriage, said Katie Nordbak, the assistant Orange County 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Those who filed for divorce after July, 1984, are probably not affected because 
the Legislature streamlined the divorce process at that time and eliminated the 
interlocutory judgment step, Nordbak said. 
</P>
<P>
Some would-be divorcees who heard of the clerk's discovery panicked and flooded 
the office with calls, wondering what havoc the news would bring to their 
lives, said Orange County Clerk Gary Granville. 
</P>
<P>
"Some said, 'If I am one (whose divorce was not finalized), does that mean I'm 
a bigamist?' " Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were wisecracking. One guy wanted to know if that means he gets 
all his alimony back. Another guy (who is married to his third wife) said he 
wouldn't mind taking his first wife back, but he wouldn't want any part of his 
second wife." 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for panic, Nordbak said. Couples who wish to make their 
divorces final may do so by having their lawyers file papers asking a judge to 
grant a final divorce decree and to declare any subsequent marriage valid, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But several attorneys specializing in family law said they would not be 
surprised if most of the unresolved divorces were left unfinished intentionally 
to take advantage of the tax and insurance benefits of marriage or simply to 
leave open the possibility of a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet about half the people they contact will know exactly the status of 
their cases and want it that way," said John K. York, vice president of the 
Orange County Bar Assn.'s family law section. 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Browning, 30, whose 1982 divorce petition was left open, said she and her 
husband kissed and made up six years ago. "We're a lot happier than before," 
she said.

A 160-foot fishing boat hit a gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico and exploded 
Tuesday night, killing three people and injuring at least four, the Coast Guard 
said. At least seven people were missing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a boom and a big ball of fire went up into the air about 300 
feet," said Allen Willett, a private helicopter pilot who ferries drilling 
crews to offshore rigs. 
</P>
<P>
"We got three life rafts in the water and I hovered low over the water," 
Willett said. "My mechanic jumped in. . . . He got the one in the most 
distress, got him inside the life raft. The other two made it on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were aboard the Northumberland when the boat hit the pipeline 
about a half-mile offshore, said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Don Merwin. 
</P>
<P>
Two Coast Guard boats and helicopters and private planes and watercraft were 
helping in the search. 
</P>
<P>
One of the injured was in critical condition with severe burns over most of his 
body.

N.Y. BANS GAYS, INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS AS SPERM DONORS

Sperm banks in the state can no longer accept gay men and intravenous drug 
users as donors because of new state health regulations prompted by fears about 
AIDS, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, sperm banks must get a state license and must subject all 
donors to at least two AIDS tests before their sperm is used, said Mary Anne 
Gardineer, an associate director of the New York state Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not be subjected to 
unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal illnesses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations took effect Monday and automatically exclude a person from 
donating sperm if he has had homosexual activity, intravenous drug use or sex 
since 1977 with a person at high risk for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The same people already are barred from donating blood in the state for the 
same reason, Gardineer said. 
</P>
<P>
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the 
body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It 
is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug 
abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have no documented cases of 
AIDS being transmitted through sperm donors, said a spokesman, Chuck Fallis.

SENATE PANEL BLOCKS GOP CAPITAL-GAINS TAX CUT; 
</P>
<P>
BENTSEN PLAN TO EXPAND IRAS WINS COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL; FLOOR FIGHT VOWED 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Finance Committee rebuffed a Republican proposal to cut the capital 
gains tax rate early today, but advocates vowed to continue the fight on the 
Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which continued to work on its own version of the tax bill backed by 
the House last week, adopted an alternative proposed by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen 
(D-Tex.) that would expand tax deductions for individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the capital gains tax cut was a 10-10 tie, with only one Democrat, 
Sen. David L. Boren of Oklahoma, joining a solid phalanx of nine Republicans on 
the 20-member tax-writing panel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have the playoffs on the Senate floor," said Senate Republican 
leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a member of the Finance Committee. "That's where the 
action is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Security Change 
</P>
<P>
The committee also approved a significant increase in the amount of outside 
earnings Social Security recipients from age 65 to 69 can earn without losing 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The new help for seniors, expected to cost about $1 billion in revenues 
annually, would be financed by boosting the ceiling on income subject to Social 
Security taxes, currently $48,000, by about $900 next year. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bentsen's proposal, taxpayers who lost the deductions for IRAs in the 
sweeping 1986 tax revision would be eligible for a 50% tax deduction on 
contributions up to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would benefit families with income above $45,000 and unmarried 
individuals with income above $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Removes Penalties 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's plan also calls for removing the 10% penalty on early withdrawals if 
the money is used to finance the purchase of a first home or pay college 
expenses for a family member. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded IRA deductions proposed by Bentsen would affect 1991 tax returns 
filed in 1992, but the penalty-free early withdrawals could begin as early as 
January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The capital gains tax-cut plan was presented by Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, 
the committee's senior Republican. Bentsen beat back Packwood's efforts to lure 
another Democrat, Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas, to the capital gains camp by 
salting his own plan with several provisions beneficial to timber interests 
that are particularly strong in Pryor's home state. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Packwood plan, which many of the Republicans praised as superior to 
the House tax bill, individuals would be able to exclude 5% of the profit on 
investments in stocks, real estate and most other assets that were held at 
least one year. The exclusion would gradually increase by five percentage 
points for each additional year an asset was held to a maximum 30% rate cut for 
assets held more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
The defeated plan, which has an effective date starting Oct. 1, would also not 
tax investment profits that resulted from future inflation. Packwood also 
included in his plan a provision that would allow individuals to set up a new 
form of IRA that allows tax-free withdrawals from retirement accounts but would 
not provide an up-front deduction for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The full House has already voted to accept a 30% exclusion that would set an 
effective top capital gains rate of 19.6%, but the top rate under that plan 
would rise to 28% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House rejected a Democratic plan that would have boosted taxes 
on the wealthy along with an expansion of IRAs. The Bentsen IRA proposal does 
not include an income tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of a capital gains tax cut now face an uphill struggle in the 
Senate, where Democratic leaders who oppose the measure are maneuvering to 
require any capital gains measure to win 60 votes instead of a simple majority 
of 51. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat in committee represents a setback for President Bush, but it is 
still possible that the Administration could win a showdown on the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Although Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate, about 10 to 15 Democrats, 
including assistant leader Alan Cranston of California, have expressed support 
for some type of cut in capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
If Bentsen can succeed in beating back a capital gains tax cut in the Senate 
after House Democratic leaders failed, it would boost his stature among 
Democrats and enhance Bentsen's undeclared effort to run for President in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Any differences in the tax bills that ultimately emerge from the Senate and the 
House would have to be settled by a conference committee. There is still a good 
chance that Congress could end up ultimately approving both an expansion in 
IRAs and a capital gains tax cut. But it now appears the final version is 
likely to be significantly different from the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
Before turning to tax matters, the committee approved a series of modest 
spending cuts, including new limits on Medicare, designed to reduce the budget 
deficit by $2.8 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance tax bill would boost revenues by $7.2 billion through a 
variety of relatively obscure measures, most of which are similar to provisions 
in the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
It would lose slightly more than $1.6 billion by making permanent several 
current business tax credits, including one for corporate research and 
development activity, and by extending other tax credits for two years, 
including those for employer-provided education. The plan also would reduce 
revenues $154 million by repealing so-called Section 89, which forbids 
companies from offering substantially more generous fringe-benefit packages to 
their principal employees than to rank-and-file workers. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the Social Security earnings limitation, which the panel had 
tentatively approved Monday, would benefit only retirees between ages 65 and 69 
who earn more than $8,880 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed to boost the limit to $11,700 next year and then to 
$14,520. On the next $5,000 of earnings -- to a total of $19,520 -- the Social 
Security recipient would give up $1 in benefits for each $4 earned. Once 
earnings pass $19,520, the penalty would be $1 for each $3 earned above the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Present law requires a retiree between the ages of 65 and 69 to give up $1 in 
Social Security for each $2 earned above the $8,880 earnings limit.

The federal government on Tuesday approved a new drug to treat severe 
schizophrenia and a monitoring program in which patients using the drug will be 
tested weekly for signs of a potentially fatal side effect. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration said the drug, clozapine, can be used only for 
patients who have not responded to at least two regimens of standard, less 
toxic therapy. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200,000 people could benefit, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug has been shown to relieve symptoms of severe schizophrenia, allowing 
patients to lead more productive lives. But it also can cause a potentially 
fatal blood disorder in which the level of white blood cells is reduced. 
Studies have shown the condition can be reversed if caught early. 
</P>
<P>
The drug also is associated with seizures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the monitoring system, a home health care company will distribute the 
prescribed medication to patients each week and collect blood samples that will 
be sent to a national laboratory for analysis, the FDA said. If the test 
results indicate that the patient must stop taking the drug, the patient's 
doctor will be notified.

SHEVARDNADZE RECALLS U.S. BREAD LINES 
</P>

<P>
In a philosophical farewell after a two-week stay in the United States, Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze gave Americans an overview of the state 
of perestroika, spiked with humor but with an undertone of warning. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze spoke to the New York-based Foreign Policy Assn., whose membership 
includes former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and other government 
officials, industrialists and academics, on the eve of his departure Tuesday 
for Nicaragua. He left no doubt that the Soviet regime is in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He used what he called the U.S. "economic nose dive" of 1929 to describe the 
state of the Soviet economy today. He recalled the bread lines in New York's 
Times Square and troops battling with the Bonus Army in Washington. He drew 
laughter with a reference to a 1931 Business Week report that 100,000 Americans 
wanted to emigrate to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economy will recover, Shevardnadze said, as did America's -- after 
much difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
He traced the origin of the Cold War to the dark days of the early 1930s. 
Communist theoreticians determined then, he said, that capitalism was doomed 
and could prolong itself only through military force, while in the West the 
thinking was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"The result was that both systems launched a massive effort to arm themselves," 
he said, and the rivalry translated domestically into ideological purity 
campaigns: "witch hunts" by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the United States and 
denunciations of "cosmopolitism" in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Where communism went wrong, he said, was in placing "enormous power" in the 
hands of the Soviet leaders. He said it was this rigid centralism that enabled 
the Soviet Union to fight World War II and rebuild afterward, but the price was 
the suppression of individual initiative and a stagnant economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Self-Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, he said, the Soviet people have gone through an unprecedented 
era of self-criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"We are filling the blank spots in our history," he said, and he asked that 
Americans do the same. 
</P>
<P>
He cited as a blank spot in U.S. history the use of atomic bombs against Japan 
in 1945. He said there was no military need to use them and that to do so was a 
political decision taken to intimidate Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy of the century must be brought to light and its perpetrators 
globally denounced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze spoke freely about Soviet problems, notably the surge of 
nationalism in a number of Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
"The paradox is that the national energy that has been given free rein by 
perestroika (restructuring) is harmful to perestroika when it assumes radical 
exaggerated forms," he said. "I believe that through dialogue at the level of 
federation, republics and other national entities, a dialogue which must be 
calm, respectful and constructive, we can resolve many inter-ethnic problems." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution of this internal tension, he said, will require a stronger 
national economy, economic independence of the republics and a "genuine rule of 
law." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to global problems, Shevardnadze said that "right before our eyes the 
world is sliding into a deep economic depression." He listed as "signs of 
impending catastrophe" the massive Third World debt and the mounting cost of 
servicing it, which has stalled growth in poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet cooperation, he said, will be needed to rescue the world 
economy and to combat the drug problem and other social threats. 
</P>
<P>
Issuing his strongest warning, he said: "To those who continue to ponder the 
problem of whether or not to help perestroika, I would like to say that if they 
think in terms of charity they are mistaken. We are not asking for that. 
Cooperation has to be mutually beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow is taking strong measures to facilitate economic cooperation 
with the United States.

There are 40,000 to 50,000 Americans in Panama, including more than 12,000 
troops stationed there under a treaty with the Panamanian government, U.S. 
sources said Tuesday as fighting flared between supporters and opponents of 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. citizens in the country 
are being asked to stay home. The U.S. Southern Command put its troops and 
civilian employes on the isthmus on Delta Alert, its highest state of 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said there are 48 employees in the U.S. Embassy.

Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said American military personnel in 
Panama have been ordered to stay put and not to travel outside the U.S.-owned 
facilities.

U.S. POLICY VIEWED AS FLAWED IN WAKE OF ANOTHER COUP FAILURE

<P>
The failure of Tuesday's coup in Panama exposed a major flaw in the 
longstanding U.S. strategy of trying to turn that country's military against 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega, according to experts on Panama's military. 
</P>
<P>
Internal dissent may be easy to foment -- Tuesday's coup began with only four 
officers. But Panama's officer corps is so small and heavily salted with 
Noriega loyalists that conspiracies are difficult to execute successfully, the 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
With only half a dozen colonels and roughly a dozen lieutenant colonels in the 
entire army, Panama's "is the most pyramidal officer corps in Latin America," 
said one of the experts, Richard Millet, a historian at Southern Illinois 
University. Noriega's intelligence agents "watch them like a hawk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Officer Corps 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the officer corps small "is how they've maintained control all along," 
said Millet. 
</P>
<P>
And "the fact that these were reasonably low-level officers" who staged 
Tuesday's uprising -- a major and three captains -- "shows that Noriega has 
been reasonably effective" in keeping that control intact, said Robert Kurtz of 
the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, U.S. officials have been trying to prod the Panama Defense 
Forces into staging an anti-Noriega coup. A succession of U.S. officials, 
including President Bush, have made public statements emphasizing that the 
United States has a grievance against Noriega, personally, but not against the 
Panama Defense Forces as an institution. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have repeatedly told reporters that those statements, which were 
repeated Tuesday, were designed to send a message to the military that a coup 
would be looked on favorably. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beyond Rhetoric? 
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports that U.S. support for a coup had gone beyond 
rhetoric. Members of Congress who have been in close contact with Panamanian 
opposition figures said Tuesday that U.S. officials had promised to aid a coup 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
However, Noriega in recent months has moved to increase his control still 
further by promoting his own loyalists within the defense forces, forcing other 
officers into retirement, said Prof. Steven Ropp of the University of Wyoming, 
who is also an expert on the Panamanian military. Those moves may have 
contributed to Tuesday's "palace coup," Ropp said, but they also solidified 
support among the officers who benefited and supplied a strong incentive for 
the loyalist counterattack that reasserted Noriega's control. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques of control in the Panamanian military have been carefully honed 
by years of experience. Noriega, himself, first became a major wielder of power 
in Panama by playing a part in a successful coup that brought a group of 
captains and majors to power in 1968. One year later, he helped put down a coup 
aimed at his patron, Gen. Omar Torrijos, Panama's strongman at the time. And 
over the years, Noriega has put down several other coup attempts and intrigues 
aimed at removing him from power, emerging stronger from each one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Led by Four Officers 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's coup attempt appears to have begun with only four officers led by 
Maj. Moises Giraldi Vega, a company commander in the Urraca battalion, a unit 
assigned primarily to guard the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters in 
Panama City. The headquarters are about a half mile from the Pacific entrance 
of the Panama Canal and a similar distance from the headquarters of the U.S. 
Southern Command. Several junior and senior officers of the Urraca Battalion 
were passed over for promotions last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"My best guess is what we have here is a palace coup" with no political 
content, said Ropp. Part of the motivation may have been disgruntlement on part 
of officers who have been passed over for promotion, he said. "There have been 
a lot of junior officers that have been retired in the last couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
Giraldi appears to have timed his coup attempt for a period when the main 
combat force of the Panama Defense Forces, the so-called Battalion 2000, would 
be away from its bases outside Panama City on a training exercise. His company, 
U.S. experts said, is a lightly armed unit with fewer than 200 soldiers. But, 
they noted, in an army as small as Panama's -- only about 6,000 troops 
nationwide with few heavy weapons -- a force that small would be enough to get 
an insurrection started. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion 2000, which was set up earlier in this decade to be the force that 
would guard the Panama Canal once Panama retakes control of the waterway, does 
possess some armor and enough force to put down any rebellion. On Tuesday, it 
did. Within a few hours after shooting had started, reporters in Panama City 
saw Battalion 2000 troops returning to the city and surrounding the 
headquarters barracks where Giraldi and his men were based. 
</P>
<P>
And so long as Noriega retains the loyalty of the Battalion 2000 officers, U.S. 
hopes of a coup that would unseat him are unlikely to come true, military 
experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect there are a lot of officers who'd like to see him go," said Millet. 
"But they're not willing to risk their own rear ends to do it."

DESPITE PLEA BY GORBACHEV, SOVIET LAWMAKERS UPHOLD RIGHT TO STRIKE 
</P>

<P>
Soviet lawmakers on Tuesday rejected the government's proposal to prohibit all 
strikes until 1991 and drafted a law that, for the first time in more than half 
a century, will clearly permit workers to strike for higher wages, better 
working conditions and resolution of grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a plea from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a complete prohibition 
on all work stoppages for the next 15 months to prevent his reforms from being 
undermined, the Supreme Soviet agreed only to authorize the government to take 
"urgent measures" to restore normal rail service and to ensure uninterrupted 
operations in other key sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Debated heatedly through most of the day, the resolution does prohibit strikes 
in the Soviet Union's transport system and in the fuel, power, metallurgical 
and chemical industries, but only pending the adoption of broader and probably 
more liberal labor legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, a compromise worked out through intensive discussions that ran 
through the night, was a major test of the independence of the Supreme Soviet 
-- the new Parliament -- and of its ability to shape the laws necessary for the 
reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who had endorsed the stronger government proposal as necessary to 
protect perestroika, as his overall program of political, economic and social 
reforms is known, in the end declared himself satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Perestroika 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision in support of perestroika," he told the deputies after the 
vote. Although it is a compromise, he said, the new powers would "help restore 
normal life" to the country, which is beset by mounting economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved 364 to 6, instructs all government bodies in the 
country to act immediately to halt the disruption of transport and the supply 
of food, fuel and other essential goods. 
</P>
<P>
It authorizes the use of troops to take over the railways in the southern 
Soviet republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, where continuing ethnic 
unrest has led to an Azerbaijani blockade of Armenia. The resolution sets a 
Monday deadline for the takeover if the blockade is not ended. 
</P>
<P>
But this fell far short of the sweeping emergency powers the government had 
sought on Monday to deal with the deepening economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking the government proposal as "an illegitimate power grab," lawmakers 
from across the country and most of the political spectrum repeatedly 
criticized the request for emergency powers as "too sweeping, too broad" and 
not justified by present circumstances and setting dangerous precedents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constitutionality Doubted 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin, emerging from the debate, acknowledged to 
reporters that the government proposal might in fact be unconstitutional as 
liberal critics had charged. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a basis for deciding what is an 'extraordinary situation,' " 
Bakatin said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies had criticized the government's assumption of emergency powers in 
sectors of the economy and regions of the country that had not been touched by 
a year and a half of ethnic unrest or by the more recent strikes by coal miners 
and steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the new labor law, likely to be adopted later this 
month, would contradict the emergency resolution in fundamental ways, not only 
confusing the country on what the real law was but also undercutting the new 
legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law accepts labor disputes as part of the economic give-and-take 
of the "socialist market" and recognizes that in some cases they will lead to 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Political Change 
</P>
<P>
This reflects not only popular sentiment in a nation where workers have long 
felt that they do not get their due, but also a significant political and 
philosophical change in a nation that has maintained that the workers were the 
"masters" of their enterprise and thus had no need to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the debate Tuesday, the old and new political thinking contrasted 
sharply. Conservative deputies argued that strikes are a form of economic 
blackmail and in the country's current crisis they only aggravate the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals, on the other hand, insisted that labor conflicts are inevitable, even 
under socialism, and that often a strike, though its cost might be high, is the 
only measure that can resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes were ruthlessly suppressed here starting in the 1930s, when the 
dictator Josef Stalin consolidated his hold on the Communist Party and the 
Soviet government. Over the last three years, however, workers have been able 
increasingly to use work stoppages to pursue their demands for better working 
conditions and higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
As drafted, the new labor legislation would prohibit strikes for political 
reasons, including those demanding changes in the constitutional system or 
those that are directed against any of the ethnic groups that make up the 
Soviet Union. Other sections of the bill, which still faces a full floor 
debate, would ban strikes threatening human life or health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Powerful Instruments' 
</P>
<P>
"A strike is an economic measure," Nikolai Gritsenko, chairman of the committee 
handling the bill, said, "and political disputes can be resolved through other 
methods, including rallies and demonstrations. . . . Strikes are powerful 
instruments in the hands of the working class, and everyone must be quite clear 
about when and how they should be used." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, talking with journalists during a break in 
the debate, said the government expects the new labor legislation to prohibit 
permanently strikes in key sectors of the economy and thus is willing to forgo 
an immediate and complete prohibition of all strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation will permit workers to strike, except in designated industries, 
under a two-week procedure that first requires mediation between them and their 
employers and then non-binding government arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Strikes will be specifically prohibited on the national railway system and on 
airlines, in communications, on city transport, in the power and defense 
industries and in governmental offices. In addition, the Supreme Soviet or the 
parliaments of the Soviet republics could vote to suspend a strike for up to 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation first came up for debate in the Supreme Soviet in July, in the 
midst of a three-week series of strikes by coal miners. While those massive 
work stoppages, involving more than 150,000 miners, were directed primarily at 
getting the government to honor its commitments, they forced the Soviet 
leadership to reassess the role of labor in the economy and in the political 
system as a result of Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate Tuesday, the lawmakers approved five sections of the new law 
but sent the remaining 10 back to the originating committee to discuss a series 
of amendments introduced by deputies.

Tuesday night to board trains for a new life in West Germany. But the special 
trains, to come from East Germany, did not arrive in Prague, and the crowds 
faced another night in the streets and encamped in the muddy backyard of the 
West German Embassy here. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the evening, embassy officials announced to an exultant crowd the news 
that another deal had been struck between Bonn and East Berlin, similar to the 
arrangement that allowed about 6,000 refugees to leave here last Saturday 
night, and that the first trains would be pulling out about 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But the confusion that has prevailed here for the last week continued, as 
neither the embassy nor railway police could offer an explanation for the 
trains' failure to appear. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the narrow streets approaching the West German Embassy were 
jammed with mostly young East Germans, including an estimated 1,500 small 
children, trying to stay warm and catch a few minutes of sleep on the cold 
cobblestones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanitation Problems 
</P>
<P>
Movement on the street was virtually impossible. In the past 24 hours, at least 
6,000 new arrivals have gathered outside the embassy -- which was closed on 
demand of Red Cross officials worried over growing problems of sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
The tent city that has been erected on the embassy's large garden grounds was 
occupied by at least 4,500 people, and, the diplomats said, it became 
impossible to squeeze in more newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the embassy, a huge baroque palace, makeshift bunk beds were full of 
sleeping children, the hallways crowded with refugees sleeping with their heads 
on their knees and refuse and duffle bags scattered in ornate drawing rooms. At 
the windows, people peered out at the crowds below, waiting for the word to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials said they assumed that the trains' delay was due to 
"technical reasons" but hinted at the possibility that the East German 
government -- in what it obviously hopes will be the last time it will face 
this problem -- was simply taking its time with the trains and pointedly not 
worrying over the discomfort of its defecting citizens. 
</P>
<P>
There was also speculation that the delay might have been suggested by the 
Czechoslovak government, in the hope that it would give time for any East 
German in the country to get to the embassy and catch the last train out. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany on Tuesday began requiring special permission for its citizens to 
travel to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy I got out in time, just in time," said Angela Jungebauer, 31, 
a high school teacher. "I am so happy I cannot describe it. My husband is 
working in West Berlin, and I have been trying to get out in the normal way for 
two years. I just had no patience any more." 
</P>
<P>
"We are just fed up," said another young man, cradling his sleeping 3-year-old 
daughter in his arms. "You know it is not easy to leave the country where you 
were born, your town, your family. But there is no future there, no chance for 
my children." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees, while not involved in politics or opposition movements, 
cited East Germany's hard-line attitude toward political reform -- now moving 
forward rapidly in Poland and Hungary -- as a primary reason for leaving. Most 
of them, they said, had apartments, cars and jobs. But, as a hospital 
technician from Leipzig said: "We have no freedom. We are frozen, our 
politicians are frozen." 
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain whether the dramatic exodus, begun Sept. 11 when the first of 
about 25,000 East Germans took advantage of Hungary's decision to lift its 
border barriers with Austria, will bring an end to East Germany's socialist ice 
age. But the events are a clear embarrassment to the regime of 77-year-old 
Erich Honecker, who will preside this weekend over celebrations marking the 
40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has been scolded by Honecker for his 
reformist inclinations, will attend the celebrations and is expected to discuss 
the refugee issue with the leadership. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze was a key participant in negotiations with the East and West 
Germans last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak government, an equally hard-line regime, has been sympathetic 
to the plight of the East German government, and has reacted with evident 
confusion over the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
After the first exodus on Saturday, police were sent to ring the West German 
Embassy to prevent more East Germans from entering the compound. By turns, they 
held back the crowd and then relented to let small groups enter, sometimes 
backing off when faced by the ambassador, Hermann Huber, or members of his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
But within hours of the departure of the first group, 200 more East Germans 
managed to elude the Czechoslovak police and scale the wrought-iron fence of 
the embassy's garden. As more continued to arrive, the Czechoslovak police by 
turns allowed some to enter and attempted to arrest others. By Monday night, 
there were between 3,000 and 4,000 inside the embassy grounds, and Tuesday 
morning, with the crowd outside steadily swelling, the police simply pulled 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crowd, the mood was weary but civilized. Volunteers passed though the 
throng handing out apples and hot tea. Some Czechoslovaks, fascinated by the 
spectacle, came out to watch. Some brought candy for the children, and a few 
offered rooms in nearby apartments to parents with small children. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the emigrants, however, stayed stoically in place Tuesday night. The 
crowd parted once to let an ambulance pass -- it had come to pick up a woman in 
the early stages of childbirth. The youngest child in the throng was said to be 
15 days old. 
</P>
<P>
One young mother, rocking a pram back and forth, said her baby was 5 weeks old. 
The mother, smiling still at the news that buses would soon take them to the 
train station, said everything was fine. Her baby was sleeping and wrapped in 
warm blankets. "She's got the most comfortable bed here," she said.

MALATHION SPRAYING FOR MEDFLY SET IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY

Agriculture officials will shower a 15-square-mile area of Rancho Cucamonga and 
Upland with malathion later this week after the discovery of San Bernardino 
County's first fertile Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday signed documents declaring a state of 
emergency in the county and paving the way for four hours of aerial spraying 
beginning at 9:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take risks and let this develop into a major infestation," 
county Agricultural Commissioner Edouard Layaye said. At stake, he said, is the 
county's valencia and navel orange crop, which produces gross revenues of $20 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
A female Medfly bearing well-developed eggs was found Friday in an insect trap 
in an orange tree at a home on Lomita Street in Rancho Cucamonga. That trap was 
one of 4,000 scattered throughout the county and monitored regularly by 
officials on the lookout for the insects. 
</P>
<P>
County officials quickly sprayed malathion from the ground in a 1,000-yard 
radius around the tree where the fly was found, Layaye said. Another 1,100 
traps also were set, but daily checks have turned up no additional flies. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly is viewed as the most destructive of fruit flies. Experts say the 
pest could cause yearly losses of more than $205 million in crop damages 
statewide if it were to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, three adult Medflies were found in Los Angeles County, 
prompting officials there to spray neighborhoods north of downtown Los Angeles 
and declare a 70-square-mile quarantine zone. 
</P>
<P>
The area to be sprayed is bordered by Euclid Avenue on the west, Arrow Highway 
on the south, Turner Avenue on the east and Hillside Road on the north. Ten 
days after the spraying, officials will begin releasing 10 million sterile 
Medflies each week until the colony perishes from an inability to reproduce.

CABLE NETWORK CANCELS 2 SDSU GAMES

<P>
The San Diego Cable Sports Network has canceled the remaining two games of its 
three-game, pay-per-view package of San Diego State home football games because 
of a lack of subscriber interest. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in conjunction with SDSU after the network and school 
lost money on the home opener against UCLA, said Marty Youngman, network 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't do it with UCLA, we figured it was best not to continue," 
Youngman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation means the network will not show the Oct. 21 game against 
Pacific and the Nov. 11 game against Wyoming from San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Youngman characterized the loss as "slight" but declined to give a dollar 
amount or say how many subscribers signed up for the UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
The three-game package was priced at $29.95. Individual games could be viewed 
for $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill is concerned enough about his football team's rash of 
penalties that he called the Western Athletic Conference office to discuss the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he spoke with the conference supervisor of officials, John 
Adams, after the Aztecs were penalized 13 times for 135 yards in a 38-27 
victory at Utah Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In four games, the Aztecs have been penalized nearly twice as often as their 
opponents -- 38 times for 335 yards to 22 for 158 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some input from (Adams) because we're trying to get better in that 
area and not making any progress," Luginbill said. "I am concerned. I don't 
know if it is because of San Diego State's past history or what." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said a team's reputation and style of play might influence officials' 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force Academy is a disciplined, military-style football team," 
Luginbill said. "(Officials) come in there (expecting) they are not going to 
have penalties. That is their thought process." 
</P>
<P>
Adams could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force is the least penalized team in the conference with 144 for 1,199 
yards. This season, the Falcons have a conference-low 22 penalties in five 
games for 161 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, after being the most penalized team in the conference two years ago 
with 109 for 908 yards, were eighth in the nine-team league last year with 75 
for 673 yards. 
</P>
<P>
This year, four teams have been penalized more than the Aztecs, led by Brigham 
Young with 47 for 459 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It is the Cougars who are the most penalized team over the past three seasons 
with 244 for 2,246 yards. The Aztecs are third with 222 for 1,916 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Todd Coomes (back, neck strain) and receiver Dennis Arey 
(hamstring) are doubtful for Saturday's game at Hawaii, trainer Brian Barry 
said. Tight end Mitch Burton has a possible hernia; his status is uncertain.

PADRES SAY THEY WOULD PASS ON KEITH HERNANDEZ

There's one flaw in first baseman Keith Hernandez's plan to join the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres don't want Hernandez, who was informed Tuesday by the New York Mets 
that he would not be returning to them. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a year ago, the Padres would have welcomed Hernandez with open arms. 
But not now. Not after acquiring first baseman Jack Clark last October. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see where he'd fit in on our club," said Tony Siegle, Padre vice 
president of personnel. "It's not like we have a DH (designated hitter) in our 
league. He'd be as asset to some club, but not ours. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got Clark, and he'll be around for at least another year. So picking up 
Hernandez just wouldn't make sense at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who had told friends he'd like to play for the Padres even before 
the Mets told him they would not offer him a new contract, hit only .233 with 
four homers and 19 RBIs while battling injuries all season. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who has one more year on his contract that will pay him $2 million in 
1990, hit .242 with 26 homers and 94 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can talk about his strikeouts, his slow start, or whatever you want, but 
Jack Clark's a real leader, " Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "He helped me out 
tremendously over the season, and he'll be a big part of our team in 1990."

BIG NUMBERS PAY OFF FOR PRINGLE, CS FULLERTON

<P>
Mike Pringle had the winning numbers Saturday, including the one on the back of 
his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's 213 all-purpose yards in Cal State Fullerton's 34-20 victory over 
Nevada Las Vegas moved him back to first in the nation in that category, 
although his per-game average dropped five yards to 234.8. 
</P>
<P>
But his numbers really came up later -- in the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said that he bought two Lotto 6/49 tickets after the game and picked 
his two regular sets of numbers, just as he does every Wednesday and Saturday. 
Five of six came up on one ticket and Pringle won $3,616. Three came up on the 
other ticket and he won five more dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's numbers: 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The jersey number of Washington State receiver Tim Stallworth, a friend of 
Pringle's. 
</P>
<P>
15 -- Chosen in memory of his best friend's brother, Tracy Anderson, who died 
last year. Anderson wore number 51 as a Cal State Northridge football player. 
</P>
<P>
27 -- This one is simple. "Me," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
28 -- The number worn by Chris Richards, a friend of Pringle's who played at 
Cal from 1986-88. 31 -- The number of Washington State running back Steve 
Broussard, another friend. 
</P>
<P>
34 -- Pringle's number at Kennedy High in Granada Hills and for two seasons at 
Washington State before he transferred. This was the only number, excluding the 
bonus, that did not come up. The number that did was 35. 
</P>
<P>
One of Pringle's other good numbers: 118. That is his rushing average, the best 
in the Big West Conference and 10th best in the nation among Division I 
players.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
CARTER DARKENS CRENSHAW DAY WITH 267 YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
'Twas, simply put, 'Twan's night. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy High tailback Ontiwaun Carter, whose friends call him 'Twan for short, 
rushed for 267 yards in 40 carries and scored four touchdowns -- all career 
highs -- in Thursday night's thrilling, 39-36, win over Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
In this game, you see, Carter underscored the On in Ontiwaun, primarily because 
Crenshaw defenders kept bouncing off 'Twan. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't see, or couldn't, the line forms here. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, after gaining 102 yards in the first 12 minutes alone, 
Carter again found daylight. He broke through the line, then bolted toward the 
right corner of the end zone. The run was short-circuited, however, when a 
traffic accident on a nearby street knocked out power in the area surrounding 
Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
What seemed destined to be a 21-yard scoring run ended when officials whistled 
the play dead as darkness enveloped the field. When the referees tried to 
locate the ball, Carter was standing in the end zone, triumphantly waving it 
above his head in the gloaming. 
</P>
<P>
With tongue in cheek, Kennedy assistant Craig Raub told officials that since 
Crenshaw had been unable to stop Carter with the lights on, that the score 
should stand. No lights, no dice, they said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the blackout probably cost Carter the school single-game 
rushing record of 279 yards, set by Edwin Jones (Iowa State) in a 1986 game 
against Cleveland and star tailback Albert Fann. Michael Pringle, now leading 
the Big West Conference in rushing as a starter at Cal State Fullerton, is 
second with 274 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A scant few hours before his finest game, Carter's own lights were out. Sick 
with the flu, he showed up for an after-school screening of a Crenshaw game 
film feeling like his head was in a vise and his stomach was in a Cuisinart. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids knew he was sick all day," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said. "I didn't 
find out until sixth period. When he walked in, he looked like hell. He said 
he'd finally gotten rid of the headache, but that he was dizzy and felt like he 
was going to throw up. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Do whatever you have to do, 'Twan, but get ready to carry the 
ball 30 times tonight." 
</P>
<P>
After the screening, Carter caught a few winks at the home of quarterback Tony 
Vazquez, and it was a good thing he did. By the end of the third quarter, 
Carter had already carried 31 times. Yet because of the success Kennedy was 
having on the ground, Francola said it would have been crazy to stop calling 
Carter's number. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't intend to run him that much," Francola said. "But they weren't 
stopping us. We ran five, maybe six different plays all game. We just 
flip-flopped them to different sides." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carter, whose stomach was still flip-flopping: "We'd score, then they'd 
score. I'd keep saying to myself, 'We can't lose this one.' I was gasping for 
air and I felt pretty bad, but I wanted to stay in there." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said that the pace of the seesaw game, in which Kennedy scored nine 
points in the final 17 seconds to steal a victory, even wore down the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of fun with those guys," said Carter, who scored from nine, 14, 
one and nine yards. "They said they couldn't keep track of the clock because we 
were going too fast." 
</P>
<P>
And fast is the key word here. Carter, who has brilliant outside speed, left 
several Crenshaw players with nothing more than a handful of crabgrass and 
chalk. Maybe that's where this see-saw business comes in. I see him . . . I saw 
him . . . touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After three games, Carter leads area City Section rushers with 572 yards and is 
averaging 7.0 yards a carry. Even though the Golden Cougars (1-2) have 
struggled, Carter has rushed for more than 100 yards in all three games, a 
noteworthy feat in that he often lines up in a single-back set. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look at this game, I don't want people to think that it was just 
Ontiwaun," said Carter, a 5-foot-11, 170-pound junior. "I don't want other high 
schools to think it's just me they have to worry about. But if teams can't stop 
us on those couple of plays, then, heck, yeah, I'm with it." 
</P>
<P>
Which means, for defenses, that what you see is what you get. It's basic stuff 
-- pitch right, dive left, option right, blast left -- unless the lights aren't 
on. 
</P>
<P>
But many folks like Carter even more when the lights are out. Well, some do, 
anyway. 
</P>

HOLMES TO TEST DOMESTIC MARKET AFTER A SMASHING EUROPEAN TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playing professional basketball in Europe has become a popular choice for 
Americans. Kevin Holmes, a graduate of Cleveland High, has made the most of 
this option. 
</P>
<P>
While other players leave the United States to play in Italy, Spain or West 
Germany, Holmes, who was drafted in the sixth round out of DePaul in 1986 by 
the Philadelphia 76ers, ended up playing professionally in Switzerland, which 
is not known as a basketball hotbed. For Holmes, however, things could not have 
worked out any better. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss refer to dunking as smashing, and the 6-foot-8, 225-pound Holmes was 
called "The Smasher" because of his stylish assortment of dunks. In his three 
seasons in Switzerland, Holmes led his club team to two league national titles 
in three trips to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, in averaging more than four dunks a game, Holmes became a national 
celebrity in leading his team to a rare Swiss double, winning both the league 
championship and the Swiss Cup. He averaged 25 points and 10 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I would always excite the crowd with my dunks," Holmes said of the 
French-speaking Swiss fans who followed his team. "I would just streak down the 
court to receive a lob pass and then I would just put together some funky stuff 
on my dunks. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where whenever someone noticed me in public, they would 
smile and say, 'The Smasher.' " 
</P>
<P>
When the 76ers showed renewed interest, Holmes decided that it was time for a 
change and signed a one-year contract with Philadelphia in August. 
</P>
<P>
"When I originally went to play over in Europe," Holmes said, "I only planned 
to play on a one-year basis. What happened was that I enjoyed being over there 
and playing turned into a learning experience for me." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes took a circuitous route to Switzerland. After being drafted by 
Philadelphia, he accepted an offer to play in Italy while playing on a 76ers' 
summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
"Things didn't work out for me in Italy once I got there," he said. "I ended up 
playing on a traveling team and not an Italian club team like I had intended. 
While playing on that team, a team from Switzerland saw me and became 
interested, which began my career playing over there." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes realized that the level of play in Switzerland was considered a step 
down from the other European leagues, but he also knew he would have a chance 
to work and improve his overall game. 
</P>
<P>
"The play in Switzerland is much lower than the play in Italy and Spain," said 
Holmes, who averaged 9.4 points and 5.6 rebounds a game as a senior at DePaul. 
"The players are not as big and for the most part they do not have the same 
basketball skills. The level is probably closer to the bottom half of college 
Division I play. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I gained confidence in myself playing there because I was able to 
pick up a lot of skills and I was given a chance to work on things. I have 
always thought of myself as a good athlete, and, in Switzerland, I had room to 
try new things because I had the time and no one on my back to pressure me." 
</P>
<P>
One person who noticed Holmes' improvement was his mother, Doris Marshall, who 
visited her son in Switzerland for three weeks last April. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin was doing things that I never saw him do before," Marshall said. "They 
really let him loose. He was stealing the ball, driving up the court and 
dunking. It was just fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
While in Switzerland, Marshall had to adjust to the Swiss version of basketball 
off the court just as Kevin had to adjust on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference was sitting in the stands," she said. "First, everyone 
spoke French and then, they all sat down the whole game. When Kevin did 
something good, I just jumped up and cheered like my normal self before I 
noticed that I was the only one. I tried to control myself but every now and 
then I jumped up anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though things were different over there, I really enjoyed myself. It was 
a great experience in a very nice atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall may have pleasant memories about her trip to Switzerland, but she is 
thrilled about Holmes' return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He has really worked hard and I am very glad that he is back in the States," 
Marshall said. "He has come a long way, and I am already making plans to visit 
him in Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, a two-time City Section 3-A Division Player of the Year who led 
Cleveland to successive 3-A titles, is realistic about his chances in the 
National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always wanted to come back and give it one more shot," said Holmes, who 
lived in Switzerland the past two years with his wife and son. "I think the 
timing is right for me to take that chance now." 
</P>
<P>
In order for him to sign with the 76ers, Holmes had to past several tests this 
summer. In July, he attended a four-day mini-camp, in which a group of players 
were selected to represent the 76ers in summer league play at Loyola Marymount. 
Only a couple of players were offered contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"All summer it has been a situation where I have been surviving cuts while 
constantly trying to impress," Holmes said. "At the end of the summer league, I 
had offers from France and Switzerland to play. I had to make a decision of 
going back overseas for the sure money or stay here with no guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers, pleased that Holmes elected to stay, project that he will play both 
forward positions and as a backup for All-Star Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going in to help the team, not just make the roster," Holmes said. "I 
will not be content to sit on the bench either because I am now accustomed to 
playing 38 minutes a game on a winning team."

Spurred by concerns about cases of scientific misconduct, a prestigious medical 
journal will require study authors to sign a pledge that they will let editors 
examine their raw data if requested, the journal editor said. The journal also 
will tighten its requirement on disclosing financial interests involved in the 
research, said George Lundberg of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. The 
steps are among requirements being imposed to protect the credibility of the 
journal, Lundberg said. The requirements will take effect when they are 
announced in next week's issue, he said at a science reporters conference in 
Houston sponsored by the AMA.

More snow blanketed the northern Rocky Mountains, adding to the 5 inches that 
covered the Continental Divide after overnight snow showers, and a dozen cities 
shivered in record early autumn cold. Up to 3 inches of snow was expected by 
late in the day in the upper elevations of Montana's mountains, where 5 inches 
was already on the ground at West Yellowstone by morning, the weather service 
said. Up to 7 inches was expected in the high country in northwest Wyoming, 
while Sun Valley and the eastern mountains of Idaho expected as much as 4 
inches on top of 4 inches already on the ground at Bald Mountain. A dozen 
cities in the Dakotas, Iowa, Minnesota and Washington state recorded early 
morning record cold temperatures for Oct. 3, including Minneapolis, where the 
morning low was 27 degrees.

MACHINISTS UNION VOTES TO STRIKE BOEING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of Boeing Co. workers, claiming their work helped make 
the aerospace giant No. 1 in the industry, rejected the company's contract as 
inadequate and voted to strike. Officials for the International Assn. of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers said about 57,000 members in the Seattle area, 
Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore., and scattered sites across the country voted by 
an 85% margin to strike at midnight. The walkout, recommended by union leaders, 
will be the first strike against Boeing since 1977. The three-year package 
proposed by Boeing calls for a general wage increase -- the first since 1982 -- 
of 4% the first year and 3% in the second and third years. Meanwhile, the union 
said it had agreed to extend its contract with Lockheed Corp. until at least 
Oct. 22. The pact had been due to expire Oct. 1, a machinists union spokesman 
said.

A group of 46 wounded Salvadoran rebels, who had staged a monthlong sit-in at 
the San Salvador Cathedral, have moved to the Mexican Embassy in hopes of 
gaining passage out of the country. The war wounded, many missing limbs, 
boarded buses chartered by family members and traveled without incident across 
San Salvador to the embassy. Embassy officials were not immediately available 
for comment, and the embassy was closed to the public after the arrival of the 
rebels. Mexico has served as an intermediary between the government and rebels 
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in evacuations of wounded 
guerrillas during the administration of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte.

As they prepare for hibernation, hundreds of black bears are foraging for 
"everything in sight" around Lake Tahoe, wildlife officials said. Residents 
were warned not to leave bacon grease or other smelly foods in garbage cans 
that would attract bears. Game biologist Gary Herron said that bears eat a wide 
variety of animal and vegetable matter and that garbage is "one of their 
favorites." Homeowners were advised to put out garbage cans for collection just 
before pickup and to wrap smelly garbage in plastic or sprinkle ammonia around 
the trash area to mask odors.

Shellfish harvesting off Charleston, S.C., was banned and warnings were issued 
against swimming in ocean water and rivers choked with untreated sewage because 
of damage from Hurricane Hugo. Crews working to re-establish a land link 
between the offshore barrier islands and the mainland hoped to raise the Ben 
Sawyer Bridge back into place today. The bridge, tilted at a 45-degree angle, 
has rested in the Intracoastal Waterway since the hurricane struck Sept. 21. 
Sewage treatment plants in the area are only partially operational and are 
removing only 30% of the pollutants from sewage. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings 
(D-S.C.) said he would ask for an investigation of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's response to victims of the hurricane, but Marilyn Quayle, 
wife of the vice president, said the agency had been unfairly criticized. She 
was in Charleston to help at disaster and American Red Cross centers.

Lebanese lawmakers, meeting in Taif, Saudi Arabia, considered a proposal to 
expand the 99-seat Lebanon Parliament, giving Muslims more representation under 
a new constitution aimed at ending the Muslim-Christian civil war. They also 
examined ways of increasing the powers of the prime minister, traditionally a 
Sunni Muslim, Lebanese sources said. Sixty-two of Parliament's 73 surviving 
deputies have been meeting in Taif since Saturday in a session removed from 
Lebanon because of a battle that began in March between Christians and a Muslim 
alliance led by Syrian troops.

A group demanding the release of a Palestinian wanted on terrorism charges in 
the United States occupied the Greek Justice Ministry in Athens for eight 
hours. About 20 members of the Movement for the Defense of Social and Political 
Rights left after officials promised them "positive developments" in the case 
of Mohammed Rashid. The interim conservative-leftist government has said that 
decisions on extradition and other foreign policy matters will be left to the 
administration formed after elections scheduled for Nov. 5. Rashid, 35, is 
accused in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Hawaii in 1982, killing a 
Japanese teen-ager and wounding 15 people.

SHANAHAN FIRED; RAIDERS PICK SHELL; 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTION MAKES ASSISTANT FIRST BLACK COACH SINCE '20S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Al Davis made history Tuesday, terminating the short reign of Mike Shanahan, 
the first outsider he had ever hired who became the first coach he had ever 
fired, replacing him with Art Shell, who becomes the first black head coach in 
the modern era of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, 42, a Raider assistant since 1983 was recently inducted into the Hall of 
Fame. Soft-spoken and popular with players, he was a Davis favorite but was 
considered head coach material by more irreverent Raiders, too. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night when the Raiders play the New York Jets in the Meadowlands, Shell 
will become the second black NFL coach, the first since Fritz Pollard, who was 
player-coach of the Hammond (Ind.) Pros from 1923-25. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a historic event and I understand the significance of it," Shell said. 
"But the main thing is, I know who I am and I'm proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm also a Raider and I don't believe the color of my skin entered into 
this decision. . . . If you know Al Davis and you know this organization, 
you'll understand that." 
</P>
<P>
And if you didn't know this organization . . . 
</P>
<P>
Davis seemed displeased with Shanahan, almost from Feb. 29, 1987, the day he 
hired the 35-year-old Denver Bronco offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
How long had he been thinking of firing Shanahan? 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfair question," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis actually started broadcasting his doubts about Shanahan's style, 
play-calling and scheme -- he thought they were overwrought and over-cerebral 
-- after the '88 opener, Shanahan's first game. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan told friends that he heard about it later, and secondhand. He wondered 
why Davis hadn't said something in camp, since the whole offense had been 
installed then and practiced with Davis watching. 
</P>
<P>
When the Raiders started 2-4, Davis confided his doubts to friends all around 
the league. By the start of this season, Shanahan's standing was already shaky. 
After an 0-4 exhibition record, CBS' Will McDonough, a Davis confidant, 
reported that Shanahan had almost been fired before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders started 1-3 and more Davis complaints surfaced: Running traps when 
a power dive would do; lining up in a shotgun on third-and-two; not throwing 
deep often enough to Willie Gault. 
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, he told Shanahan he might be let go and told Shell he might 
replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning -- "about 6 o'clock," Davis said -- he made the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When I originally made the determination to hire Mike Shanahan," Davis said, 
"it was predicated on the feeling that I thought our organization needed a 
fresh implementation of ideas to go along with what we were doing, to add to 
it. I felt that what was happening at this time was going in the direction of 
total change. 
</P>
<P>
"I make these points to you. In the last nine Super Bowls, seven of them were 
won by teams that didn't use the shotgun. That's one example. I could make a 
lot of points to you about power winning the big games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say to you is, I believe in matchups. We believe in matchups. We 
don't believe in scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what concerned me the most, the first time I really started to 
be concerned. In January, right after the season, there was an interest in 
letting go of about seven to eight of our (assistant) coaches -- I hope to God 
this can be taken in the spirit it's intended. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I couldn't do it. I just wouldn't do it. It's not me. My life is 
here. These guys have given their lives to this organization. There are so many 
people who count on us, who have worn the uniform or wanted to. I just couldn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
The assistant coach snafu became a scandal. Shanahan had brought only three 
assistants with him and had encountered resistance from Raider holdovers. He 
clearly wanted to clean house, and did fire Tom Walsh and Joe Scannella. 
</P>
<P>
When Davis found out about it, he told Walsh and Scannella they weren't going 
anywhere and reversed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, to the contrary, takes the stage secure in his Raider standing, as 
Shanahan never was or could be. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't want to do is stand here and talk about Mike or demean anything 
that he has done," Shell said. "He said there were some things he wanted to do 
to give us direction. He did things his way. And being a coach, you have to 
want to do things your own way. 
</P>
<P>
"Our direction has to be one of regaining our identity. The identity of power, 
explosion, simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care if you know where we are on the field. We don't care about that. 
We also know where you are. We want to keep things simple here, put our players 
in a position to win." 
</P>
<P>
Shell's promotion, may be a significant moment in Raider history, but it is a 
watershed in the social history of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I played next to Art for 15 years and he was always a student of the game and 
wanted to be a head coach . . . but until today a head coaching job in the NFL 
was out of reach," Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., 
said in a news release. "However, I always felt that Al Davis would hire the 
first black head coach in NFL history." 
</P>
<P>
History wasn't lost on Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatness of bringing Jackie (Robinson) into baseball wasn't bringing 
Jackie into baseball," he said. "It was the great success that Jackie had when 
he got into baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Art that last night. I said, 'You know, all the great things you've 
done as a player can be lost if we're not successful.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's the important thing to me, that he succeeds, that we give him every 
opportunity to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is a historic occasion -- and I realize who he is and what's happening 
here, I'm not lost on that -- it's only meaningful and historic if he's a great 
success. And that's the thing we have to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Thus Art Shell dons the silver-and-black headset and steps into history. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure will always be there for me as a head coach," Shell said. "But 
even if I was coaching at a high school, the same pressure would always be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about winning. We're going to put the players in a position to win. 
We've had great players here, great coaches. And I plan on following in that 
tradition of being a great coach."

DAVIS' MOVE LACKS TIMING AND IS UNFAIR TO BOTH MEN

<P>
For the last couple of weeks, some Raider officials have been quietly attacking 
their young coach, Mike Shanahan, dropping hints that he had proved ineffective 
and too young to run a National Football League team. 
</P>
<P>
And, under cover, Raider owner Al Davis has been the principal rumor spreader. 
</P>
<P>
That created a football climate of inevitability in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Day-in and day-out attacks often change doubt into certainty. 
</P>
<P>
Thus when the Raiders fired Shanahan Tuesday, it seemed as if the move had been 
inevitable -- although it hadn't been. 
</P>
<P>
The coach merely took the fall for an organization that since the mid-1980s has 
brought in too many losing players. 
</P>
<P>
The last coach, Tom Flores, a Super Bowl winner, was the first to discover 
that. The real question today is whether, down the road a piece, Art Shell will 
be the third. 
</P>
<P>
As the first black man to coach an NFL team since the 1920s, Shell is taking 
over at the wrong time and place. If he is the league's greatest coach since 
Vince Lombardi, he has a chance. If he isn't, he will find it very tough going 
on a team that is pushing its many problems off onto him. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Raiders are being unfair to this particular man, who is a nice guy 
and a knowledgeable coach. They are asking him to correct their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
If he can, he should be the next commissioner. Or at least the next owner. 
</P>
<P>
Shell moved up to become the NFL's first modern-era black coach on the day that 
Cito Gaston of the Toronto Blue Jays became the first black to manage a 
baseball playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
They made history Tuesday in El Segundo and Oakland, and in both instances it 
was history long delayed. 
</P>
<P>
There have been only three other black managers in baseball, Lary Doby, Maury 
Wills and the leader of this year's Baltimore Orioles, Frank Robinson, who 
narrowly missed the playoffs himself, finishing two games out with a team that 
never folded after leading most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's first black coach, Fritz Pollard, served in the league's prehistory, 
leading a club known as the Hammond (Ind.) Pros after the college season was 
over from 1923 through '25. Pollard's Pros finished 1-5-1, 2-2-1 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
On first inspection, the Shell-Gaston parallel seems close. Both were promoted 
with the 1989 season under way, Gaston succeeding Jimy Williams last May. 
</P>
<P>
If Gaston could advance a baseball team with a 12-24 record into an 89-79 
winner -- making the best record in the majors, 77-49, since May 15 -- will the 
world now expect Shell to boost a 1-3 Raider team to the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
That is Shell's challenge, and it's an unfair one because baseball and football 
are very different games. Ballclubs change managers all the time, with all 
kinds of results. 
</P>
<P>
Football teams, playing 16-game schedules, make midseason coaching changes only 
out of desperation, and usually only as a cover for management's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
If Raider owner Davis wanted a black coach, he should have hired him when he 
took Shanahan on, or, at the latest, this spring -- giving Shell the time to 
establish his kind of team. 
</P>
<P>
With the season under way, it is impractical in pro football, if not 
impossible, to haul in a coach from another state. The only real Raider option 
was to promote an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
For promoting Shell, Davis will be remembered as the first NFL owner to hire a 
black coach, but he will be getting more credit than he deserves. His timing is 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons pro football has been slower than baseball to hire black 
chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is a sport of individuals. By and large, baseball players are paid on 
their individual statistics, not on the achievements of their team. 
</P>
<P>
There are powerful financial reasons for a batter to get a hit every time up, 
regardless of whether his side is winning or losing by, say, 10 runs, and 
regardless of what he personally thinks of his manager, his owner, or even his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, football is more of a team sport. The Super Bowl is seldom won by 
the NFL's best congregation of football players. It is usually won by that 
year's best team -- provided it isn't too crippled by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the NFL's wisest scouts and assistant coaches today estimate that there 
are no more than eight or 10 fully competent head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And because there are 28 teams, those without all want one of the eight or 10. 
</P>
<P>
The probability is that, in terms of percentage, there are as many qualified 
black candidates for head coach, here or anywhere, as there are white 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But in choosing head coaches, most NFL club owners have been badly burned, some 
of them over and over. The more experience they get in football, the more they 
understand the complexities of the coach's job. And in their view, to hire a 
black coach is simply to add one more complicating factor. 
</P>
<P>
So in each of the last 60 years, they simply wouldn't do it, and they're still 
running scared. 
</P>
<P>
For years, football teams wouldn't have black quarterbacks, either, but as of 
1989, the NFL's quarterback models are Warren Moon and Randall Cunningham. And 
by the year 2000, there may well be more black than white quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL should be hiring more Art Shells, too, and if it had a Central Casting 
office resembling IBM's, or that of General Motors, it would. But as long as 
individual owners run the clubs, it's likely that they will continue to run 
scared.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE THROWS A WILD CARD INTO GAME

Wild Thing Williams, a combination of Dizzy Dean and Daffy Duck, hopscotched 
through the Wrigley Field dugout Tuesday and then sprang up the steps -- shaggy 
hair protruding from his cap, Cap'n Ahab beard fuzzing up his chin -- until he 
whooshed right by the Chicago Cubs' last Hall of Famer, Billy Williams, whose 
specialties as a player were reliability and restraint. Cub careers are all 
these Williamses have ever had in common, trust us. 
</P>
<P>
"All right, everybody watch your lips! I'm getting loose!" Mitch Williams cried 
out, to nobody in particular, for no particular reason, and then off he went to 
chuck some baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Williams watched him come and go, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Wiiiiild thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye on this deliverer of comic relief, this designated mad hatter, as 
the Cubs go after their first National League pennant in 44 years, starting 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
This is the character who, in his first season with the team, came within one 
save of Bruce Sutter's club record, but simultaneously became the relief 
pitcher Cub fans could and couldn't trust. Maybe he'd throw it over the plate, 
or maybe he'd hit Harry Caray in the head. They never knew. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Thing. He makes their hearts sing. He makes everything, well, groovy. 
</P>
<P>
Cub pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, on Mitch Williams: "I pitch like I'm sitting in an 
easy chair, and he pitches like his hair's on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh outfielder Andy Van Slyke, on Mitch Williams: "If everybody pitched 
like him, I'd quit." 
</P>
<P>
He is the guy who makes Chicago heartbeats flutter like a knuckleball. Not only 
do the Cubs have Ryne Sandberg, they also have the second coming of Ryne Duren. 
One Mitch pitch goes down the pipe. Next Mitch pitch goes up the screen. Third 
Mitch pitch goes across the corner. Fourth Mitch pitch goes around the corner, 
out a side exit and into Yum-Yum Donuts, next door to Wrigley. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Thing. They think they love him, but want to know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
Cub fans could hardly believe their eyes when the man who cost them 
sweet-swinging Rafael Palmeiro in a nine-player trade toed the rubber on 
opening day, proceeded to walk the bases loaded, then proceeded to strike out 
the side. That, some will tell you, was his most consistent performance of the 
season. That was Mitch Williams on a good day. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's hard to tell a Mitch Williams pitch from a pickoff attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even invited to pitcher-catcher meetings before games anymore," Wild 
Thing said Tuesday, on the eve of the Cub playoff series against the San 
Francisco Giants. "They don't want to say anything to me, because they don't 
want me thinking." 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't pitching without thinking, Wild Thing is speaking without 
thinking. Or else it just comes out funny. Williams might get into hot water 
with some of his teammates if some of his quotes are taken out of context, 
condensed into one or two sentences, with all the true meaning and flavor 
sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while discussing Manager Don Zimmer's occasionally unorthodox 
strategy Tuesday, Wild Thing said: "He makes certain moves and a lot of people 
look at him like he's got spinach in his teeth." 
</P>
<P>
What you have to understand is the amount of admiration and affection Williams 
has for Zimmer, and that he wouldn't for all the world want to sound unkind to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same way he feels toward shortstop Shawon Dunston, so when Williams 
says "some of the things he does on the basepaths are almost ignorant," the 
truth of the matter is that he is flattering Dunston, talking about how his 
teammate is so unbelievably aggressive that opponents can't believe how crazy 
his baserunning is. 
</P>
<P>
They feel much the same way about Williams' pitching. Everybody does. They call 
him Wild Thing because he is definitely a wildman, and because actor Charlie 
Sheen played a character with that nickname in a baseball comedy. But they also 
call for him whenever the Cubs need a couple of outs in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't particularly care what I'm called, as long as they keep calling," 
Williams said. "As long as they're calling me something other than 'bum.' " 
</P>
<P>
What makes Mitch pitch? What can be expected of him from one day to the next? 
Almost anything. One day in Pittsburgh, he took a Jeff King line drive in the 
temple. Next day, he pitched. Teammates kidded him that the ball hit him in the 
one place no damage could be done. This is a franchise that at various times 
has had its hands on Sutter, Lee Smith, Guillermo (Willie) Hernandez, Goose 
Gossage, Bill Caudill, the late Donnie Moore, even the ace of the Giant bullpen 
that opposes them in this series, Craig Lefferts, and often was left agonizing 
as these relievers carried other franchises into the playoffs. Last time the 
Cubs won a World Series, in 1908, was there even such a thing as a "relief 
pitcher?" 
</P>
<P>
Now, here's this goofball with a fastball, Wild Thing Williams, who spends his 
spare time at bowling alleys, and gets his lower torso tattooed, and avoids the 
barber the way some people avoid the dentist, and today it might be up to him 
whether Chicago goes most of the 20th Century without a baseball championship, 
North Side or South. 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth once pointed toward center field here before swinging. Perhaps Mitch 
Williams will point toward the press box before throwing. Anytime he doesn't 
kill anybody this series, they ought to give him a save.

A'S GET JUMP ON BLUE JAYS WITH 7-3 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
RICKEY HENDERSON PUTS ON QUITE A SLIDE SHOW 
</P>

<P>
Modesty and Rickey Henderson have never been running mates, so asking him what 
he's meant to the Oakland Athletics this season is a little like forgetting to 
throw over when he's leading off first base. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say I was the final piece of the puzzle," Henderson was telling 
reporters before Game 1 of the 1989 American League Championship Series. "They 
were missing a leadoff hitter, they were missing a left fielder. When I used to 
look at the Oakland team, I'd think about what was holding them back from being 
a great team. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they were waiting for me to come back and fill that." 
</P>
<P>
That's Rickey. Speak loudly and carry a big quick. 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest of humanity, all we can do is listen and watch when Rickey 
decides to let his legs do the talking, as in the sixth inning of Tuesday 
night's AL playoff opener, when Henderson turned a tense 3-3 standoff into an 
eventual 7-3 Oakland victory with one 90-foot sprint. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of Henderson's dash from first base was Toronto second baseman 
Nelson Liriano, taking a toss from shortstop Tony Fernandez and bracing for an 
inning-ending double-play pivot. 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson ambushed Liriano just as he received the ball, sliding hard and 
forcing Liriano off balance and out of sync. Liriano's relay to first base more 
resembled an infield dribbler, skittering wildly past Blue Jay first baseman 
Fred McGriff for an error that allowed the second of two Oakland runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
A tie had been broken, along with the Blue Jays' spirits. Toronto failed to 
manage another hit during the final three innings and surrendered quietly, 
watching its only real shot at a split in Oakland go up in a cloud of dust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we sent a message," said Oakland's other Henderson, center fielder 
Dave. "You got your No. 1 man on the mound tonight. I know that if Stew failed 
for us, we'd be feeling a little letdown. I'm sure they feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, they've got to rely on their second and third guys to win -- which their 
first guy didn't do. And that puts more pressure on them." 
</P>
<P>
And Toronto's second guy is a 24-year-old right-hander named Todd Stottlemyre, 
who was in triple A as recently as June 30, an owner of 34 major league starts 
and an 11-15 major league record. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland will counter with Mike Moore, whose final regular-season numbers were 
19-11 with a 2.61 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Yep, that was one hell of a slide by Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
An inning earlier, the A's had trailed, 3-1, before Dave Parker singled home 
Carney Lansford. Then, in the bottom of the sixth, Mark McGwire homered off 
Stieb to get Oakland even, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
A strikeout and a pair of infield singles by the Lower-Case A's, utilitymen 
Tony Phillips and Mike Gallego, followed, bringing Henderson to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Acker, who relieved starter Dave Stieb, got a fastball in on Rickey 
Henderson and wound up stinging him on the wrist. Henderson jogged down to 
first to load the bases for Lansford, who seemed to shut down the threat with a 
weak bouncer to Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Carney Lansford didn't hit the ball tremendously well," Henderson said, quite 
accurately. "(But) I got a great jump, a big lead. With the speed I have, 
that's why I was able to get to second base so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had a good chance to break it up." 
</P>
<P>
When Henderson staggered Liriano so that his throw wound up rolling into foul 
territory, both Phillips and Gallego were able to score, giving Oakland a 5-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"A game-breaker," was how Oakland starter Dave Stewart, the winning pitcher, 
described Henderson's slide. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, a key play in the game," added Oakland Manager Tony La Russa. "I 
think if anybody gets hit on the wrist -- and he got popped pretty good -- the 
adrenalin starts pumping and Rickey made the pivot man pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs hard, plays hard, slides hard. That's our style." 
</P>
<P>
And Henderson revels in his role as Athletic style-setter. 
</P>
<P>
"I can create things and be a very productive player," he said. "I watched this 
team from the stands during the last playoffs (in 1988) and noticed that they 
lacked something exciting at the top of the order. I can give this team 
excitement at the top of the order. 
</P>
<P>
"If we win the championship, I think I'll be a difference because I can get on 
base and make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Other A's, while thankful for the midseason trade that engineered Henderson's 
return to the Bay Area after 4 1/2 years with the New York Yankees, were 
somewhat less effusive in their praise of their leadoff man. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to blame them, though. Few can keep up with Rickey in that department, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an important difference," La Russa said. "I don't want to put it on one 
guy. But it's obvious that we now have a set lineup when we didn't have one 
last year. And Rickey takes care of the leadoff spot." 
</P>
<P>
All Stewart would say about it was that "Rickey's an addition to an already 
good ballclub. We're now capable of winning games under any condition." 
</P>
<P>
Before Rickey Henderson, Oakland subsisted fairly well on the home run -- and 
there were two of those Tuesday night. Dave Henderson accounted for the A's 
first run with a solo homer in the second inning and McGwire's shot in the 
sixth tied the game and set the stage for Rickey Henderson to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Two more Oakland runs scored in the ninth, the first when Gallego blooped a 
double to left and came home on a wild pitch by reliever Duane Ward. The second 
came courtesy of Rickey Henderson, who walked, stole second and scored on a 
single by Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
A total of seven bases were stolen Tuesday, establishing an AL playoff record. 
The previous record was four, which the A's tied with two steals by Rickey 
Henderson and one apiece by Lansford and Phillips. Toronto's three steals were 
by Mookie Wilson, Liriano and Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a great night for the catchers, Toronto's Ernie Whitt and Oakland's 
Terry Steinbach, although Whitt did manage to hit a bases-empty home run in the 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
That evened his ledger for the evening: Four bases gained, four bases given up. 
</P>
<P>
Whitt's home run was notable for one other reason. It was the last hit Stewart 
allowed. Once Whitt gave Stieb a 3-1 lead, Stewart retired 13 of the next 15 
batters he faced, issuing only harmless walks to Wilson in the fifth and 
Liriano in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Dennis Eckersley took over for Stewart and as he did four times 
in four attempts against Boston in the 1988 playoffs, Eckersley closed out the 
victory -- this time retiring the Blue Jays in order. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson remembers those A's of '88, the ones that swept the Red Sox before 
unexpectedly falling to the long-shot Dodgers in five games. He remembers, as a 
Yankee observer, being remarkably unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played against them, I didn't think they were that good at all," 
Henderson said, grinning. "I never thought they had that great a group of 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
And now? 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I think we have a tremendous team." 
</P>
<P>
No brag, just fact, Rickey says. And it was hard to argue with the facts at 
second base in the sixth inning Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
A.J. Foyt, four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, escaped serious injury Tuesday 
when he crashed at Charlotte Motor Speedway at Concord, N.C., during a practice 
session for an upcoming NASCAR race. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit the wall in turn three, slid about 300 yards and came to a stop at the 
entrance of pit road," speedway spokesman Eddie Gossage said. "The track 
emergency staff worked about 10 minutes to get him out of the car. They were 
mostly trying to be easy because they didn't want to hurt him worse than he 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Gossage said Foyt was conscious and alert when taken to the speedway hospital. 
He was then transferred to Charlotte Memorial Hospital where officials said 
X-rays proved negative.

Two baseball memorabilia dealers said they are being questioned by Internal 
Revenue Service and FBI agents as part of a federal grand jury inquiry to 
determine whether Pete Rose evaded income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's investigation into Rose concluded this year that Charles Sotto had 
arranged for more than $32,000 in payments to Rose for signing autographs at 
memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The IRS did talk to me," Sotto told the Cincinnati Post. "They wanted to know 
how much business I had done with Pete." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Perkins, a memorabilia dealer who lives in Florence, Ky., said the FBI 
wanted to see a $5,000 check he had given Rose for a baseball card show in 1987 
in Nashville, Tenn.

About 1,500 workers struck the Caliente Race Track in Tijuana, Mexico, asking 
for higher wages as the Mexican peso drops in value against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout affected the Race and Sports book operations at eight locations, as 
well as greyhound racing. If it is not resolved by the weekend, horse racing 
will be canceled.

JOHNSON MAY BE OUT AS METS' MANAGER 
</P>

<P>
Davey Johnson's future as manager of the New York Mets appears to be in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Cashen, general manager of the Mets, told Newsday that he is close to a 
decision concerning Johnson's future with the club, but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported Tuesday night that Johnson will be fired. AP said 
Cashen confirmed that a decision had been made. "I don't want to equivocate, 
but the decision has been made," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
AP said Cashen would not reveal the decision until he had spoken with the 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
But when the New York Times asked Cashen about the AP report, he said: "That 
simply isn't true. We have not made any decision." 
</P>
<P>
Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' vice president for baseball operations, said: "The 
decision has not been made. I underline that." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Cashen was quoted as saying, "I don't have any timetable. I 
can't even discuss it with Davey. He's off fishing or something." 
</P>
<P>
From Newsday came this Cashen quote: "He's the manager of the team until I tell 
him differently." 
</P>
<P>
Newsday said Johnson, convinced he's about to be fired, apparently is refusing 
to take calls from Cashen. 
</P>
<P>
It appears the only obstacle to dismissing Johnson appears to be Cashen's 
inability to reach his manager, who is believed to be fishing near his home 
outside of Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has two years left on a three-year contract, has not been eager to 
speak with Cashen since a meeting last week that Johnson believes was a prelude 
to his firing. 
</P>
<P>
Dugout coach Bud Harrelson reportedly is the leading candidate to become the 
next manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets bid farewell to 35-year-old co-captains Gary Carter and Keith 
Hernandez Tuesday. Cashen told both to find different clubs for next season. 
They are eligible to become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference for the two Tuesday, Carter and Hernandez came to 
Johnson's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Davey is the guy to point a finger at," Carter said. "It's 
everybody's fault." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hernandez: "Davey's big plus is that he works well with young players. 
Patience is one of Davey's strong points."

LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;

<P>
INJURED GIANTS LOOK FOR SECOND WIND AGAINST THE CUBS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only thing strong or steady here Tuesday was the wind, which chilled the 
teams who tonight begin a National League championship series that neither 
seems capable of winning. 
</P>
<P>
Huddled in one Wrigley Field clubhouse were the East Division champion Chicago 
Cubs. You love them because they haven't won a pennant in 44 years, or the 
World Series in 81 years. You love them because of their bleachers, their ivy, 
and that break-dancing grandfather named Harry Caray. 
</P>
<P>
But do you know them? 
</P>
<P>
Quick, name one of their catchers. Any of their catchers. How about the left 
fielder? OK, then the center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
A hint: None of them, nor 14 other Cubs, have ever played on national 
television in October. 
</P>
<P>
In the other clubhouse, dressed in turtlenecks, long johns and puffed chests, 
were the Western Division champion San Francisco Giants. They have just won 
their second division title in three years. They have the game's most powerful 
3-4 punch in Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
But historically, hitting does not help teams in body casts. 
</P>
<P>
It was announced Tuesday that catcher Terry Kennedy has a mysterious shoulder 
ailment, startling news that was greeted by Giant officials with nothing more 
than a rolling of eyes. That is because scheduled Game 3 starter Don Robinson 
has a bad right knee, reliever Craig Lefferts has a not-so-mysterious shoulder 
ailment, and Clark is still hobbled by a bruised knee suffered in a recent 
collision with Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are Mitchell's tender left wrist, third baseman Matt Williams' 
hamstring strain, and shortstop Jose Uribe's bruised left shoulder. These sore 
Giants have been administered more shots than Mitchell has hit. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Giants' leader, Clark: "I just hope we've got enough guys to drag out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Cubs' leader, Rick Sutcliffe: "I just hope we never wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning tonight in Game 1 at Wrigley Field at 5:15 p.m. (PDT), with the Cubs' 
Greg Maddux (19-12) facing the Giants' Scott Garrelts (14-5), both teams had 
better hope this seven-game duel is not determined by the one player who seems 
poised and vicious -- the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"There are really only two bad parks in this league for the wind," Lefferts 
said. "Ours, and theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Here at Wrigley, with little notice, infield fly balls can land in the seats. 
At the Giants' Candlestick Park home, with little notice, infielders can land 
in the seats. 
</P>
<P>
"But at least here, the wind goes in one direction, and you know which 
direction," Cub first baseman Mark Grace said. "There, you have to send four 
guys after every popup." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lefferts: "You watch, the wind will bite somebody. They are used to it, 
and so are we, and it doesn't matter. Before it's all over with, somebody will 
definitely get bit." 
</P>
<P>
If it happens to the Cubs, they may not feel it. After winning just nine games 
in spring training, worst in the league, they won eight of their first 10 
regular-season games. Then, behind the unorthodox moves and inspiration of 
Manager Don Zimmer -- he has used his cleanup hitter to suicide-squeeze bunt -- 
the Cubs embarked on a journey during which they spent 100 days in first place, 
including the final two months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I've got to touch myself to make sure I'm really here," shortstop 
Shawon Dunston said. 
</P>
<P>
He's not the only one. Only six Cubs have been here before, including just 
three from that 1984 division championship team that beat the San Diego Padres 
in the first two playoff games in Wrigley Field, then lost three straight at 
San Diego, blowing what was then a best-of-five series. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys on this team ask me all the time about how bad that was and I tell them, 
up until now it was the highlight of my career," said Sutcliffe, who with his 
tender shoulder apparently healed will start Game 3. "All of us have to 
realize, we may never be here again." 
</P>
<P>
It is that attitude that should most scare the favored Giants. From catchers 
Joe Girardi and rookie Rick Wrona to rookie left fielder Dwight Smith to rookie 
center fielder Jerome Walton, the unknown Cubs may have no idea how much they 
should fear. 
</P>
<P>
"We might not be smart enough to get nervous," first baseman Mark Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, for example, is nursing a sore right hamstring. But he laughed when 
asked if he should play at less than 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't matter what percent I'm at," he said. "I'll be there. I deserve to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Not that rookie-of-the-year favorite Walton -- he hit .293 and stole 24 bases 
-- or Smith, with a team-leading .324 average and 52 RBIs in 109 games, or even 
tonight's starter Wrona, who hit .283, should have reason to worry. They will 
be surrounded by steady Grace, who hit .314; Andre Dawson, who hit 27 home 
runs, and, of course, by the quietly great second baseman Ryne Sandberg, who 
batted .290 and hit 30 homers. 
</P>
<P>
And if things get tense, all the Cubs need to do is bring in reliever Mitch 
Williams, who typified this team from opening day, when, against Philadelphia, 
he loaded the bases in the ninth inning, then struck out the side. Of course, 
he doesn't have any postseason experience either. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK," he said. "Even when I'm in trouble, I don't think I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, 18 of whom have postseason experience, know when they're in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
They ended the season losing six of their final seven games and were swept by 
the Dodgers in a series that showed just how much Robinson and Clark were 
hurting. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the problem with today's scheduled starting catcher, Kennedy, an 
important left-handed hitter against the Cubs' three right-handed starters in 
this series, Maddux, Mike Bielecki and Sutcliffe. He woke up Monday with a sore 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he thought he had slept on it wrong. But it was still hurting 
Tuesday, enough to require a cortisone shot and much fretting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a serious problem," said Giant Manager Roger Craig, who was satisfied 
enough with Kennedy's Tuesday workout that he will still probably start today. 
"Thing is, the whole world knows that maybe now he can't throw as well, or 
swing at bat as well. That's not good." 
</P>
<P>
Craig was also satisfied with a simulated game pitched Tuesday by Robinson, who 
has been fighting his sore knee for a month. Even though the 235-pound pitcher 
grunted through every delivery, it appears he will at least be able to walk to 
the mound for Friday's scheduled start, following Garrelts and Rick Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come this far, man, I definitely want to go out there," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Clark. He shook his head when asked if his badly bruised knee, 
suffered a couple of weeks ago when Scioscia fell on him, was healed. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope, it's not better at all, but now is not a time to be worrying about it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Clark noted in a touch of humility, he, despite his .333 average and 
111 RBIs, and Mitchell, despite his 47 homers and 125 RBIs, aren't the most 
important Giants today. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to this series will be the No. 1 and 2 hitters," he said. "They've got 
to get on for the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
For the Giants, those hitters will be Brett Butler and Robby Thompson. For the 
Cubs, it will be Walton and Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Clark and his teammate think they can win, no matter what. When 
asked if he was eagerly anticipating an all-Bay Area World Series, Clark 
grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"You're forgetting something," he said. "Oakland has to beat Toronto first."

A'S MAKE STRONG STATEMENT;

<P>
MCGWIRE, HENDERSON TURN ON POWER IN WIN 
</P>

<P>
In the great power outage of the 1988 World Series, Jose Canseco and Mark 
McGwire, the celebrated Bash Brothers, were less than electric, and Dave 
Henderson didn't prove to be the alternative source. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson went 6 for 20 in the five-game wipeout by the Dodgers, but failed to 
homer and drove in only one run. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire was 1 for 17 with one homer and one run batted in, and Canseco was 1 
for 19 with one homer, four RBIs (all coming in his first at-bat of the 
Series). 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics returned to postseason play here Tuesday night with a 7-3 
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in the opening game of the American League 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And while the Bash family insisted that as individuals they are not trying to 
erase the memory of last October, McGwire admitted that, at least 
subconsciously, it's one more motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't finish off what we set out to do last year," he said, "and I think 
that's still with us. I think if we stay within ourselves and don't try to do 
more than we're capable of, we can complete the job this time." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire and Henderson, at least, got off to impressive starts, supplying that 
missing power of a year ago in a victory that demonstrated that the A's go to 
work with more than a tape measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays had taken a 2-0 lead in the second inning when Henderson got one 
back in a hurry, opening the Oakland half with a home run off Dave Stieb. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays led, 3-2, in the sixth when McGwire hit Stieb's first pitch of 
the home half into the left-field seats for a 3-3 tie, touching off the 
decisive three-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, however, attempted to deflect the spotlight later, saying Rickey 
Henderson provided the big hit when he broke up a double play later in the 
inning, leading to the two runs that snapped the tie. 
</P>
<P>
"That changed everything. It was a routine double play. The game would have 
been tied still," McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey has been playing like that since the first day he got here. He's happy 
to be home and happy to be with a team of this ability. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at us and think we're a power team, but we do a lot of other 
things as well. We steal bases, move guys over, take guys out at second base. 
You don't win 99 games hitting home runs every game." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson gives the A's a dimension at leadoff they lacked last year, 
but there is still something catalytic about the home run, the potential that 
rests on one swing. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time the other team scores I think it's important to come right back and 
score. It demonstrates that you're going to keep the pressure on and stay in 
it," Dave Henderson said. "I think that was the importance of my homer." 
</P>
<P>
Said McGwire, of his: 
</P>
<P>
"Stieb had been throwing a lot of breaking balls and I thought he'd try to 
sneak something hard by me. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a nasty slider, but he got it over the middle of the plate and I got 
a good look at it. I could tell when I got back to the dugout that the team was 
pumped up. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tied again against a good pitcher, and we have the feeling we're tough 
to beat in the late innings." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson and McGwire had tuned up impressively for the playoffs, driving 
the A's through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, the center fielder, had 18 RBIs in September and a .433 average with 
runners in scoring position, closing out a see-saw season in which he hit 15 
homers and drove in 80 runs. 
</P>
<P>
He came in with a .286 career average for the playoffs and a .356 World Series 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider myself the new Mr. October," he said in response to a 
question. "I just want to be known as a pretty good player who doesn't back 
away from the pressure of a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I always seem to hit better in the second half, and that's when the playoffs 
and World Series always seem to be scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, the first baseman from USC, led the league with eight home runs in 
September, then hit another Sunday, his 26th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of McGwire's last 10 hits have been homers, which is characteristic of a 
season in which he hit 33 to rank third in the league and drove in 95 runs to 
tie for 10th, but batted only .231. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a rocky year for me, in some ways my most difficult," McGwire said. 
"I know I'm not a .231 hitter, but my power numbers have been up near the top 
(despite missing more than two weeks in April with a back injury) and I feel 
good about that. 
</P>
<P>
"The strange thing is that when I came up in 1987 (and set a rookie record with 
49 homers while batting .289), the average was overlooked. Nobody wanted to 
talk about it. This year, it was the average that got all the attention." 
</P>
<P>
Not from everyone, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's offensive responsibility is to produce runs, and when you get over 30 
homers and 90 RBIs, you're doing that," Manager Tony La Russa said. "If you 
look at his season overall, you'd have to say it was a good one, but Mark 
considers himself a complete hitter, so he's not satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, who joined Canseco as the only players in major league history to hit 
30 or more homers in each of their first three full seasons, said he has been 
confident that the hits would begin to fall -- or soar. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty good about the way I'm swinging now," he said, "and I consider 
this the start of a new season. The statistics don't matter now, nor does what 
we did in last year's World Series. It's a new year, a new team." 
</P>
<P>
The results were the same for Canseco, however. The most famous Bash Brother 
struck out three times and has gone hitless in his last 22 postseason at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, too, said he is not thinking about last October's frustrations, but La 
Russa said: "I think he and Mark are motivated to beat the band, but they've 
got to work with discipline. Jose had a couple good at-bats early, but then he 
was trying to hit one out." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire and Henderson each did, meaning that in the first playoff game of the 
new October, the bashers were well represented.

DIONNE CUT; RANGERS TRY TO FIND TEAM FOR HIM

The New York Rangers cut their ties Tuesday with center Marcel Dionne, the 
National Hockey League's third all-time leading scorer, and said they were 
trying to find a place for him elsewhere in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"It was mutually agreed upon by the Rangers' coaching staff and myself that 
Marcel Dionne, judging by the just completed training camp, will not be a 
member of the New York Rangers' hockey team this season," Ranger General 
Manager Neil Smith said in a statement. "At Marcel's request, we will continue 
to explore the possibility of his joining another team." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers were vague about the disposition of Dionne's contract, which calls 
for him to make about $600,000 this season, his last one with New York. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's no interest from other clubs, there is a mechanism in Marcel's 
contract that has been mutually agreed upon," said Smith, who would not specify 
the mechanism.

COUNTY DELAYS A DECISION ON DNA TEST LAB; 
</P>
<P>
WIEDER CITES RAPE CASES IN A PLEA FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors Tuesday delayed establishing a 
genetic-testing lab for at least a month, prompting the board's only woman 
member to question her male colleagues' concern for rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I identify with this issue as a woman more than my 
colleagues," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, whose request for immediate 
funding of a DNA lab got no support. "I think it's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's request for $120,000 to help the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
set up a DNA lab was spurred by last week's rape of a 12-year-old in Huntington 
Beach, allegedly committed by a man who five months earlier had been acquitted 
of a rape charge after prosecutors were late in obtaining DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotional Argument 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting at times took an emotional, personal tone. At one point, 
Wieder turned to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Roger, you have a daughter. What if?" 
</P>
<P>
Stanton did not answer immediately, but after the meeting he said her remark 
was in "bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
"My pulse was beating fast; I was trying to restrain myself, which I did," he 
said. "My wife heard that remark (on an intercom) in my office; she got very 
upset about it also." 
</P>
<P>
While rejecting Wieder's request, the board indicated that it supported the 
idea of establishing a lab and unanimously approved Supervisor Don R. Roth's 
proposal for several agencies and departments to report back in 30 days on 
staffing and financing a lab. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be spinning our wheels, spending our money," said Wieder, who 
voted with the majority even as she disagreed. "We're arguing about what might 
happen tomorrow. I want to be able to sleep tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's home is in the same gated community, Sea Cliff on the Greens, where 
the kidnaping of the 12-year-old girl occurred Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want to Await Budget Review 
</P>
<P>
"That little girl would not have been raped" if the county had its own lab, 
Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, a former police officer, called Wieder's 
statements that her colleagues were perhaps not sensitive to the issue 
"outrageous. . . . In my case, I've been a police officer and handled many 
tragic situations -- I've seen the consequences of crime. It's very unfortunate 
that those references were made." 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, Stanton, Roth and Vasquez said they were 
reluctant to approve any new programs before a budget review in January. 
</P>
<P>
"This is too important not to move ahead as rapidly as possible," Roth said, 
"but I think we have to do it in an orderly manner." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates told the supervisors that most of the 
questions about the lab could be answered immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that it appears the board is in favor of DNA," Gates said, "but 
I'm unhappy they were unable to do it today." 
</P>
<P>
Gates has already raised $80,000 in private money to open a DNA-testing lab. 
</P>
<P>
DNA -- deoxyribonucleic acid -- is the fundamental molecule in human life that 
carries a genetic code unique to each individual. That code can be gleaned from 
samples of human hair or body fluids. 
</P>
<P>
County law enforcement agencies must send samples to private laboratories on 
the East Coast for analysis. The tests cost up to $350 each, and several tests 
are usually required in a single criminal case, according to Larry Ragle, who 
recently retired as head of the Sheriff Department's crime lab and is now 
coordinating Gates' effort to create a DNA facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheaper Tests 
</P>
<P>
A county lab could do the tests for about $50 each, Ragle said. 
</P>
<P>
But the most significant problem in using private labs is that they are 
backlogged three to four months, Ragle said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the backlog may well have led to the acquittal of Kyle Joseph 
Borges, the 29-year-old suspect charged in the Huntington Beach rape. 
</P>
<P>
Borges was found not guilty of raping an Anaheim Hills woman after a judge 
refused to let prosecutors introduce evidence from DNA tests that did not 
become available until after the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Hills woman attended Tuesday's board meeting and was angry at its 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have 30 days," she said. "It seemed rather strange to me that 
Harriett Wieder was the only woman on the board. The other board members were 
men. They could never be victims of that crime."

RIVAL TO S.F. OR PARIS; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE PLANS TO TRANSFORM ITS DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jolted by projections of a massive traffic crunch, Irvine officials Tuesday 
laid out ambitious plans for a concentrated business/residential district that 
officials hope will cut down on commuter congestion and give Orange County a 
true downtown, one that would rival San Francisco's Market Street or Paris' 
Champs Elysee. 
</P>
<P>
Still in its infancy, the broad proposal for the radical redesign of the 
existing 2,500-acre Irvine Business Complex -- now made up largely of imposing 
office buildings with few residences and scant pedestrians -- includes these 
key features: 
</P>
<P>
* Private development of up to 30,000 residential units within walking distance 
of the city's growing business sector. 
</P>
<P>
* An inner-city monorail and another, as yet unspecified regional 
transportation system for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
* The "transformation" of Von Karman Avenue north of the San Diego Freeway into 
a "Great Street," replete with ground-level shops, restaurants and cultural 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
* The creation of downtown city parks. 
</P>
<P>
* Improved access to John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, built on the assumption that some people will want to live where they 
work, is aimed at cutting commuter traffic by as much as 43% to ward off what 
Mayor Larry Agran said could be "an unmitigated disaster" in traffic congestion 
in the growing district by the early 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Resistance Conceded 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who will now seek public comment on a far-ranging plan that was 
a year in the making, concede that they may get criticism from Irvine 
homeowners who fear a spillover into their neighborhoods from those heading to 
restaurants, theaters and other cultural activities in the heart of the 
proposed district. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, they may face some resistance from developers who have a financial 
stake in Irvine's rapidly burgeoning economy and may resent interference from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
But while city officials and private planners spoke in gushing terms about 
their vision for the city at a press conference, others in the development and 
business community reacted cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds very attractive, but we'll have to wait and see what it's all 
about," said Pat Klone, chairman of the board of the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"But Irvine is certainly ready for expansion and is a very desirable place to 
live by anyone's standards," she said. Noting the planned attempt to get 
employees to live in the area, she said, "The whole idea that 'you'd be home by 
now if you lived here' is an attractive one to a commuter." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Thomas, vice president for communications at the Irvine Co., said the 
plan "really represents a dramatic departure from what exists today in (the 
Irvine Business Complex) and what was originally planned for it." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are some things we'll like about (the plan) and others we 
won't, but it's really premature to talk about it. Our people will have to take 
a close look at the plan and see what it means," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The unveiling Tuesday of the conceptual plan for the district, giving few 
specifics, was essentially a trial balloon floated by city officials to gauge 
public reaction. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to gather reaction from the public at a series of hearings and 
meetings this fall. And in February, the city's Planning Commission is due to 
begin the review and approval process. Even under the most optimistic 
projections, completion of the city's vision of the new downtown is at least 
three decades away. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, many details remain undetermined. City officials said they 
believe the city could legally take back some of the entitlements it approved 
in the early 1980s for business use. But they said they do not intend to go 
that route, but instead rely on free market pressures to shape the development 
of the area in keeping with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the project also remains largely unexplored. City officials said 
they expect the myriad of residential, commercial and transportation projects 
envisioned to come from private rather than public resources. But they are 
banking on getting $125 million in state money through a November bond 
initiative to finance the plan's unspecified transportation system.

ON THE TRAIL OF LOBSTER TAIL; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S TIME TO TRAP COASTAL DELICACIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The seas were calm and the morning sky was a postcard blue as Rick Gallagher 
and his crew set out from Dana Point Harbor earlier this week to get a head 
start on the long-anticipated lobster season. 
</P>
<P>
Though the six-month season was not to open until today, Gallagher, 37, wanted 
to get all his traps and bait in place so he could waste no time in catching 
the spiny delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
"This part really isn't very exciting," Gallagher said as he secured a load of 
lobster traps on a 40-foot boat docked at Dana Wharf Sportfishing. "But 
Wednesday's payday!" 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher and his crew of two were among dozens of local fishermen who this 
week began dotting the Orange County coastline with color-coded buoys that mark 
the spot where they have set lobster traps. 
</P>
<P>
Although commercial fishermen such as Gallagher won't check their traps until 
daybreak today, lobster season actually began hours earlier, at the stroke of 
midnight, when hundreds of scuba divers typically converge on Laguna Beach and 
other coastal waters to hunt for the night-crawling creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The season, which begins the first Wednesday of every October, lasts until the 
first Wednesday after the 15th of March, which in 1990 will fall on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
But with ever-increasing hordes of fishermen in competition, Gallagher and 
others say it should take only a short time for everyone to deplete the seas of 
catchable crustaceans. 
</P>
<P>
"We catch 75% the first four days," Gallagher said. "By Thanksgiving, it (the 
season) is pretty much over." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing popularity of the pastime, the species of spiny lobster 
that inhabits the Southern California coastline does not appear to be in any 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, figures from the California Department of Fish and Game indicate that 
the crustacean is thriving, with a record haul of 634,468 pounds in the state 
reported last season. The lobster catch has been increasing steadily since 
1975, when a record low of 152,000 pounds was tallied statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Although the figures are for the entire coast, they come primarily from 
Southern California, Fish and Game officials say, as the crustaceans do not 
generally venture into the colder waters north of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game officials attribute the growth in the lobster population to state 
legislation in 1975 requiring escape ports in trap cages for below-limit 
adolescent lobsters. Before those ports were mandated, young and old lobsters 
alike were scooped up into the traps, causing a steady decline in the species, 
said Dave Parker, a Fish and Game marine biologist in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The vast bulk of the lobster catch is made by commercial fishermen, who have no 
limits other than not taking in any lobster less than a regulation 3 1/4 inches 
long, Parker said. Sport fishermen, by contrast, are restricted to seven 
lobsters per day. 
</P>
<P>
But commercial fishermen complain that some divers raid their traps and make 
off with much more than their daily allotment. One fishermen said a surfer once 
used his board to lift a heavy trap and remove the contents. 
</P>
<P>
Some divers take this illegal shortcut because it is extremely difficult to 
capture the elusive lobster by hand, Parker said. A wary creature by nature, 
lobsters tend to congregate in rock and coral formations where they can quickly 
scurry out of reach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They tend to move faster than you do," Parker said. "And they maintain as many 
as three escape routes." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial fishermen don't have to be concerned with the speed or 
elusiveness of their prey. They merely bait a cage with mackerel and wait for a 
lobster to follow its nose inside, where a trap door swings shut. 
</P>
<P>
Although it sounds easy enough, it involves a lot of work and preparation. For 
example, the first order of business for Rick Gallagher was building his 
3-foot-square and 3-by-4-foot metal cages by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"See these," he said, extending heavily 
</P>
<P>
blistered and callused palms. "That's from making these things." 
</P>
<P>
Weighing up to 60 pounds apiece, the cages are then fitted with up to 30 feet 
of yellow-colored line, at the end of which a buoy marker is attached. Each 
fishermen uses his own color to distinguish his catch from the rest. Gallagher 
chose pink for his. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Gallagher set out his first 20 traps along the coast just north 
of Dana Point Harbor. On Monday, he worked with boat skipper Todd Mansur, 23, 
of Dana Point, and deckhand Jeff Belet, 18, of Dana Point, to throw out another 
84. 
</P>
<P>
The trap-setting was long, arduous work, interspersed with rest breaks of 
potato chips and cold beer. Working about a mile off the coast between Dana 
Point Harbor and the San Clemente Pier -- six miles away -- Mansur maneuvered 
the 40-foot Cyperlurus into position as Gallagher directed and Belet hefted the 
cages gently overboard. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for about six years," Belet said, straining under the 
load of a cage he was about to drop into the turquoise-green water. "It's fun, 
if we don't lose our traps. A bad storm can cause sand to fill up the trap so 
that you can't move it. Or, it can go under rocks and get smashed up and 
useless." 
</P>
<P>
Intermittent large swells on Monday gave a hint of storm activity elsewhere in 
the Pacific. Gallagher looked at the swells with some concern, but then 
shrugged his shoulders, saying that the vulnerability of the traps makes the 
whole lobster business something of a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is everything can look great, like today, and then a storm comes 
along," Gallagher said. "Then you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
It costs about $50 to outfit each cage, Gallagher said. Because up to 20 
one-pound lobsters can be caught in each trap -- and with lobster now fetching 
up to $6 a pound -- Gallagher figures his operation stands to net $120 per 
cage, or more than $10,000 for all the cages he has put out. 
</P>
<P>
That's not exactly peanuts, but at the same time Gallagher doesn't view it as 
having the same kind of profit-making potential as taking boatloads of paying 
fishermen out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can look at this (lobster fishing) as a livelihood," he 
said. "It's something else to do on the water. It means just getting out of the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
For Monday's trap-setting operation, Gallagher chose the shallower waters just 
off the coast, where spiny lobsters spend each summer spawning eggs before 
retreating to deeper waters for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
He was particularly interested in dropping traps around kelp beds, which grow 
from the kind of rock formations that lobsters love to inhabit. Mansur, the 
skipper, also monitored a video screen on a Fathometer that reveals ocean depth 
as well as whether there are rocky or sandy conditions on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all hard bottom here," Mansur said as he squinted his eyes to look into 
the Fathometer while cruising slowly through one large kelp bed off San 
Clemente. "It's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
"Todd," Gallagher called out from the deck about that time, "let's put one in 
here. We found a lot in here one year." 
</P>
<P>
The crew wound up setting out a half-dozen traps in that same location. They 
had been preceded by several other fishermen, whose earlier presence was 
evidenced by black, yellow and red buoys bobbing in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
When the crew had finished about two hours later, they headed back to shore, 
prepared to return Tuesday morning to pull the traps up from the water and load 
them with bait. Under state law, commercial fishermen are allowed to bait their 
traps the day before lobster season begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick, you gonna remember any of this?" Belet asked Gallagher in reference to 
the location of all the traps. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be so easy," Mansur chimed in with a grin, pointing at a long line 
of pink buoys receding into the distance toward Dana Point Harbor. "It's gonna 
be a straight line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPINY LOBSTERS 
</P>
<P>
Name: Spiny lobsters make up the genus Panulirus and are also called sea 
crayfish. Panulirus interruptus is the California spiny lobster of the Pacific 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Where found: Spiny or rock lobsters are found along the Pacific coast of North 
America, the African coasts, the Caribbean and the coasts of Australia and New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Uses: In various other European countries and in the United States, the frozen 
tails of spiny lobsters are marketed as rock lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Description: Unlike true lobsters, members of the Palinuridae family (so called 
because of their very spiny bodies), do not have large claws. Usually only the 
abdomen is eaten and is marketed as lobster tail. The antennae are strongly 
developed. Most species live in tropical waters. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: They spend their days in crevices in rock or coral, emerging by night 
to forage for invertebrate prey. They return from their nightly wanderings to 
dens within a feeding range of hundreds of meters, and after several weeks they 
may move several kilometers to a new location.

JURY CONVICTS DEAF MAN OF MURDER WITH TORTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young deaf man with a history of psychological problems was convicted Tuesday 
of murder with torture in the stabbing death of his ex-girlfriend and of the 
murder of her mother at their Santa Ana home two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, who had deliberated five days at the four-month trial in Santa Ana, 
must now decide whether 32-year-old Ronald James Blaney Jr. of Fountain Valley 
was sane at the time of the killings. A hearing is scheduled to begin before 
Superior Court Judge Leonard H. McBride next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If found sane, Blaney would face an automatic sentence of life without parole 
because of the jury findings of torture and multiple murder. Prosecutors had 
accused Blaney of torture only in the younger woman's death. They claimed that 
he had inflicted special punishment on her for rejecting him. 
</P>
<P>
Blaney, whose eyes were concentrated on the sign-language interpreter, stood 
stoically when the verdicts were read. He blinked nervously when he learned the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Deputy Public Defender James S. Egar, said Blaney "is frightened 
and confused. He is devastated." 
</P>
<P>
Blaney has admitted that he was responsible for the May 4, 1987, stabbing 
deaths of Priscilla Vinci, 33, and her mother, Josephine Vinci, 65, who were 
found on the kitchen floor of the home they shared. 
</P>
<P>
Blood splatters in several rooms and defensive wounds on the women's hands 
showed that they had struggled for their lives, with Priscilla once making it 
to the door before her death. She was found with multiple stab wounds to her 
face and wounds to her back. Prosecutors say Blaney stabbed her in the back as 
she lay on the floor clutching a throw rug to her chest to protect herself. 
</P>
<P>
The women were stabbed more than a dozen times each with three different 
instruments: a carving knife, a smaller kitchen knife and a fondue pick. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Blaney has admitted, he took a shower in the victims' home and 
changed his bloody clothes. He also took money from them and their house keys. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Blaney suffered an epileptic seizure inside the house, 
leaving him unconscious of what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
Blaney did not testify, but family and friends told jurors that he was 
distraught that Priscilla Vinci, who was also deaf, wanted to cool their 
relationship to just a friendship. At the same time, his father testified, 
Blaney also had lost his job with an accounting group and was upset because he 
felt that his deafness limited his chances to make enough money to provide for 
a family. 
</P>
<P>
Egar also presented testimony that Blaney suffered from rubella at birth, 
leaving him mentally impaired as well as deaf, and that he suffered from 
emotional problems most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Blaney's mother, Dawn, broke down when she heard the clerk read the jury's 
finding of torture. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a case which touched so many lives," Egar said. "This is a 
tragic case for the Vinci family and for the Blaney family." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert H. Gannon, who was in another court Tuesday morning 
and did not hear the verdicts read, had argued that Blaney went to the Vinci 
home knowing that he was going to kill both women. 
</P>
<P>
"If he couldn't have Priscilla, nobody could have her; and Josephine Vinci 
wasn't going to stop him," Gannon had said. "He wanted to inflict upon 
Priscilla the ultimate price . . . extreme, cruel, prolonged physical pain." 
</P>
<P>
The special circumstances findings could have qualified Blaney for the death 
penalty. But prosecutors chose before the trial not to seek the punishment. 
They said they based the decision on Blaney's lack of a criminal record and 
their belief that jurors would not send a deaf man to the gas chamber. 
Testimony showed that Priscilla Vinci had tried to break off the relationship 
for several months, but Blaney had resisted. In one argument, Blaney struck 
Priscilla, chipping a tooth. The Vinci family had asked him to stay away from 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
The day of the killings, Blaney had told the young woman, communicating through 
telephonic equipment for the deaf: "I'm sorry, but you will suffer more from 
your problems because you won't resolve them." 
</P>
<P>
Blaney drove to his mother's home in Arizona after the slayings and immediately 
confessed to his family. He was arrested the next day and has remained in 
custody at the Orange County Jail since.

Drivers for Highway Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, Tuesday released the 
findings of a study conducted in Orange and Riverside counties that the group 
said strengthens its stance that car-pool lanes do not significantly reduce 
pollution or congestion on California highways. 
</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute press conference in Santa Ana, the group unveiled a detailed, 
11-page study conducted by the California Department of Transportation in 
August that assesses the impact on air quality in Orange and Riverside counties 
associated with the Riverside Freeway improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
The study considered the environmental impact of two alternatives -- car-pool 
lanes versus unrestricted, general purpose lanes -- for the expansion of the 
Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The report basically states that the best local air quality results were with 
the general purpose lanes," said spokesman Larry Koenig. But state officials 
are not considering general purpose lanes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials in the Orange County office said the report retrieved by the 
group was based on inaccurate traffic data. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone in our office gave inaccurate figures to the consultant for the 
study," said Ron Kosinski, environmental division chief for Caltrans in Orange 
County.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDEN GROVE; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE ALLOWS PRINGLE TO RESUME FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has won a partial victory in his suit 
against the state Fair Political Practices Commission, allowing him to resume 
fund raising for his legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs on Monday overturned the FPPC's ruling that 
said money for Pringle's defense was subject to provisions of Proposition 68 -- 
passed by voters in November -- which prohibits raising money in a year when a 
candidate's name is not on any ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's attorney, Thomas R. Malcolm, said Pringle will now resume his 
fund-raising effort to pay for his defense against a suit filed by the Hispanic 
Political Council. The suit alleges that some voters were intimidated by 
uniformed security guards posted by Pringle's campaign at 20 Santa Ana polling 
places when they tried to vote on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, upheld another element of the FPPC's ruling that restricts 
the amount Pringle can raise for his defense fund to $1,000 per contributor. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both Pringle and the FPPC said they have not decided whether to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle was narrowly elected last year and will be on the ballot again next 
year. He claims to have already spent $170,000 for his legal defense in the 
federal suit about polling guards. 
</P>
<P>
A trial on the issue of intimidation by the polling guards is scheduled to 
begin Jan. 16.

SEPARATE TRAILS GRANTED IN MUSTANGE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Tuesday was forced to grant separate trials for two men 
accused of trying to kill Mustang Bar investor C. William Carroll, when one of 
the defendants refused-against his attorney's advice-to allow anymore 
postponements. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Angelo Grosso, 46, went on trial Tuesday before Superior Court Judge 
John L. Flynn Jr. His co-defendant, convicted racketeer Michael Anthony 
Rizzitello, 62, will be tried in November. 
</P>
<P>
The two are accused of shooting Carroll three times in the head-leaving him 
permanently blind-on April 1, 1987, in a Costa Mesa parking lot. Carroll had 
been a major investor in the Mustang topless bar on Harbor Boulevard in Santa 
Ana. Prossecutors claim that Rizzitello was trying to muscle his way into 
control of the bar, which has remained closed since early 1988, after two arson 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 59, refused for 18 months to identify who shot him. But a year ago, he 
told authorities that Rizzitello had fired the shots and that Grosso had driven 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso, a limousine service operator in Costa Mesa who frequented the Mustang, 
has made statements to the media and to authorities that it was George 
Yudzevich, a former bouncer at the club who had shot Carroll when Grosso 
stepped out of the car to make a telephone call in response to a beeper 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso's statements resulted in his attorneys this summer asking to leave his 
case. They were replaced by William Yacobozi Jr. of Newport Beach. Yacobozzi 
said Tuesday that he has repeatedly told his client he needs more time to 
investigate, but that Grosso has turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been in the Orange County Jail for a year without bail. I think he's just 
worn down," Yacobozzi said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Grosso's previous attorneys had failed to persuae the courts to grant him a 
separate trial from Rizzitello. But Tuesday, Flynn had no choice. Rizzitello's 
attorney, Anthony Brooklier, was tied up in another case and could not be 
ready.

LAGUNA NIGUEL ANTI-JAIL GROUP SKEPTICAL; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY ASSURANCES FAIL TO DAMPEN 'WORRY AND CONCERN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The head of a Laguna Niguel citizens' advisory group said Tuesday he is 
"worried and concerned" that the community is under study as a possible jail 
expansion site, despite county government's assurances that Laguna Niguel is 
not a likely jail location. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wilson, president of the Laguna Niguel Community Council, an advisory arm 
to county government, said he is not reassured by the county's statements last 
week that a recently updated environmental impact study has no real bearing. 
</P>
<P>
The county last week acknowledged that a Sept. 15 environmental impact report 
has listed Laguna Niguel and nine other areas in the county as potential sites 
for a jail branch. But county officials said the report was simply an update of 
a study made a year ago. They said that year-old study already had found Laguna 
Niguel and the nine other sites as not meeting all the requirements for a jail 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors favors Gypsum Canyon in North Orange County for 
a new jail and has endorsed an expansion of the existing Theo Lacey Branch Jail 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Orange opposes the expansion of the Theo Lacey jail and filed suit 
to block it. That suit has required the county to update its jail site study, 
county officials said last week. But they said they do not believe the updated 
environmental study will result in any change of jail expansion sites. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson announced Tuesday, however, that he remains skeptical about county 
government's intentions and will appoint a committee within the Laguna Niguel 
Community Council to study the implications of the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Niguel can't sit still and let things happen to it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident we are going to become a city (in the Nov. 7 cityhood election 
in Laguna Niguel), and then we'll be able to fight something like this just 
like Anaheim and the other cities. But we want to make sure that in the 
meantime we're not blind-sided by something the county might do." 
</P>
<P>
The county's Sept. 15 jail-site environmental impact report lists the South 
County Civic Center at Alicia and Crown Valley parkways as a possible site for 
a branch jail, arguing that it would put prisoners close to the branch 
municipal courthouse at the civic center. But the report also acknowledged that 
Laguna Niguel area residents probably would object to the site being used for a 
jail branch.

MISSION VIEJO MAYOR'S SON SENTENCED FOR CHECK KITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The son of Mission Viejo Mayor William S. Craycraft has been sentenced to three 
months of home confinement and five years' probation after pleading guilty to 
check-kiting in the Illinois city where he attends college. 
</P>
<P>
William S. Craycraft Jr., a 19-year-old sophomore and honor student at Illinois 
College in Jacksonville, Ill., pleaded guilty in June to four counts of federal 
bank fraud. The sentence, delivered Monday, also orders Craycraft to perform 
300 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said Craycraft ranked at the top of his Illinois College 
class last year but was stripped of his honors after his conviction. 
Craycraft's lawyer confirmed that his client had been forced to return a prize 
given to him for academic excellence and had been placed on academic probation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Learned His Lesson' 
</P>
<P>
There was no answer at Craycraft's Illinois residence Tuesday, but Mayor 
Craycraft said he believed that his son had "learned his lesson." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a bright young man, and he's got a tremendous future ahead of him," the 
mayor said. "The sad thing about it is that he's embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
According to officials in the U.S. attorney's office in Springfield, Ill., the 
younger Craycraft illegally tried to obtain interest by writing checks to one 
bank account and three savings and loan institutions in Jacksonville. Craycraft 
opened accounts at the institutions with between $100 and $200, but he wrote 
checks totaling $94,926.50, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"He opened four interest-bearing checking accounts, and he was writing bigger 
and bigger checks between them, trying to take advantage of the float," said 
Patrick Kelley, an assistant U.S. attorney in Springfield. "That might work in 
a big city like L.A., but in Jacksonville, the banks start calling each other 
when something unusual is going on. That's how we caught up with him." 
</P>
<P>
Craycraft's scheme was uncovered before he had made any money off it, Kelley 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Appeal Likely 
</P>
<P>
His sentence began immediately; Craycraft will be confined to his grandparents' 
home in Jacksonville for three months except to attend classes, work and 
perform his community service. 
</P>
<P>
David Woodruff, a Jacksonville lawyer who defended Craycraft, said that no 
appeal was likely, given what he called a "most lenient sentence."

BLACKOUT AFFECTS ABOUT 1,500 IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,500 customers in Irvine were without electricity for an hour or more 
Tuesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Gilleland, a spokeswoman for Southern California Edison, confirmed that 
the outage occurred around 7:30 p.m. in the Northwood area of Irvine, south of 
Walnut Avenue between Culver Drive and Yale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Two Edison crews restored power to about 1,100 customers within an hour, and 
were working to restore service to the rest late Tuesday night, Gilleland said. 
The cause was attributed to the failure of an underground cable. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire neighborhood was in darkness. We couldn't tell what was going on," 
said James Sibaila, a Northwood resident.

LAST LINE OF DEFENSE: GOALIES FACE UP TO TOUGH TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Keith Nighswonger had a purpose when he went out to watch his Sunny Hills 
High School frosh-soph water polo team practice early in the season. He was 
hoping for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
As the team was warming up, a few of the freshman players got into the goal and 
tried to deflect shots. Nighswonger watched and waited. 
</P>
<P>
Most gave up after a couple of shots in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mark Magna gave it a try. He blocked a couple of shots and let a few 
get by him into the goal. Then, a ball caught him square on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Magna shook his head and gave Nighswonger a little smile. He got hit again and 
still he stayed in the cage, flailing away at shot attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens every year, you pray for it to happen," Nighswonger said. "Almost 
every freshman tries to play goalie at least once. Most get hit in the face and 
get out of there. The one who stays is a goalie." 
</P>
<P>
It's not quite as simple as that, but it's the first test. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches agree that goalie is the most demanding position in water polo. A 
goalie is the last line of defense and the catalyst for the offense. 
</P>
<P>
The position has changed during the past 10 years. No longer is the tall kid 
who can't swim fast thrown into the goal and asked to sink or block. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches look for a variety of skills, such as hand-eye coordination, leg 
strength and quickness. The position also calls for a quick-thinking, although 
sometimes peculiar, mind. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a camp for goalies, run by North Hollywood Harvard High School 
Coach Rich Corso, who was the goalie coach for the U.S. national team for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a specialty position," El Dorado Coach John Bowman said. "If 
you've got a prospect who's not afraid to get hit with balls traveling 50 
m.p.h., then you have a possibility. Hopefully, he's tall with long arms. But 
you have to start training him early." 
</P>
<P>
Good goalies are rare and can make a good team a great one. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Corona del Mar goalie Jim Wagner carried his team to the Southern 
Section 4-A title. In the semifinal game against top-seeded Sunny Hills, Wagner 
stopped 15 shots, including two in the final 30 seconds as the Sea Kings won, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Andrew Tinseth of Sunny Hills is considered the best goalie in 
Orange County. The Lancers, who lost several key players to graduation, depend 
on him to stop almost everything until their offense develops. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids play much better knowing Andrew is behind them," Nighswonger said. 
"They can take more chances because they know he's there to save their bacon." 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches take one of their best, if not their best, athlete and begin 
training him for the position when he's a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of practice, Newport Harbor Coach Bill Barnett takes the 
freshman team and holds a 25-yard race. He tries to talk the winner into 
becoming a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett is looking for is the player with the strongest legs, which will enable 
him to tread water at length and then extend out of the pool to block shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to convince a kid to become a goalie," said Barnett, who 
also coaches the U.S. national team. "It's like basketball, most kids want to 
score. You have to tell them that if they become a good goalie, they can pretty 
much pick what college they want to attend." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett will work with a goalie on anticipating shooting angles and baiting 
opponents into shooting too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
And, while other players swim endless laps in the pool, the goalies usually are 
off by themselves doing drills designed to build leg strength. The drills vary 
to a degree, but they serve the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- El Toro Coach Don Stoll has goalies lift chairs over their heads while 
swimming from one end of the pool to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edison Coach Matt Whitmore has them lift 25-gallon bottles of water over 
their heads while treading water. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tustin Coach Tony Choquehuanca also uses water bottles, but he has his 
goalies spend up to a half-hour just playing catch with the ball, while the 
rest of the team swims laps. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to tease the field players that we didn't have to do all that 
swimming, back and forth," said Erik Grove, who played goalie for Tustin last 
season. "They'd give us a hard time, but actually we worked just as hard. It's 
tough lifting those bottles and holding them for 45 seconds, then bring it down 
for 10 seconds, then lift them again, while you're treading water." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Barnett, some coaches limit the training to stamina. They don't feel 
qualified to teach technique. Some schools do have goalie coaches, but most 
goalies are on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is things you can't teach," Choquehuanca said. "You can work on 
positioning and try to build his confidence, but you don't want to teach any 
bad habits." 
</P>
<P>
So for technique, there is always the Corso Goal Keeper Academy at Harvard 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Corso never played goalie. He was a field player at Southern Connecticut State. 
However, he has spent all of his years as a coach learning the position. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years, Corso has run what he calls the only goalkeepers school 
in the world. He has up to 50 kids, from as far away as Illinois and Texas, 
during the one-week camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them that they're going to be left alone a lot and give them drills 
they can use," Corso said. "We also tell them they shouldn't be doing the same 
conditioning as the rest of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all of the instruction is on technique. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things I learned was to push the weights back on the goal," 
El Toro goalie Eric Terwilliger said. "That makes the front of the goal tip 
down and makes it smaller." 
</P>
<P>
A standard practice, according to Corso. 
</P>
<P>
Corso admits he takes the position too seriously at times. But he also said 
that most coaches in the United States, at all levels, are unqualified to coach 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, goalies are treated different and coached the same as field 
players," Corso said. "That's on the college level as well as high school. They 
don't understand the position." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that coaches don't realize how much the position, and game, has 
changed. Goalies are no longer expected to be just defensive players. They must 
also control the offense like a point guard does in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
After a shot is missed, a goalie must start the offense with a lead pass. He 
also can become a shooter, especially in high school where the playing area is 
only 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
When Corso was the goalie coach for the national team, he instructed Craig 
Wilson, who became the premier goalie in the world. Wilson is a great defensive 
goalie, as he's 6-foot-6 with a wing-span of 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
However, his talents are not limited to defense. His passing skills made the 
U.S. team even more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"We really changed the game in 1980 and '84," Corso said. "Craig's technique as 
a passer has been copied by everyone. Goalies were looking to get the pass out 
to start the fast break." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who used the technique successfully in the 1988 Olympics, is another 
who has long believed that the goalie is the key to the offense. He works with 
them to perfect their outlet passes and coordinate the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a defensive position," Barnett said. "But any team that wants 
to fast break better have a goalie who can make that long pass." 
</P>
<P>
The offensive-goalie idea has trickled down to the high school level in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The goalie has got to direct the play," San Clemente Coach Steve Yancey said. 
"Not only does he have to make the correct pass, but he has to keep everyone 
aware of the time left on the shot clock. He also has to be a threat to score 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Corso has been less successful in convincing coaches of goalies' sanity. He 
says the notion that goalies are odd is more folklore than fact. 
</P>
<P>
However, the facts don't exactly support his case. Even Barnett, who agrees 
with most of Corso's theories, is hard to convince. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are nuts," he said. "But that's part of being a good goalie. 
They're outgoing and hyper." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said a few years ago he had a goalie who didn't like to swim. Barnett 
requires his water polo players to also join the swim team, which brought the 
two into conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"The day swim practice started, he showed up to school with his arm in a 
sling," Barnett said. "He said he dislocated his elbow and couldn't swim. He 
had it for weeks. One day I ran into his parents and asked how he got injured. 
They said, 'What?' He made the whole thing up so he wouldn't have to swim." 
</P>
<P>
Almost every coach has an offbeat story about a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
"You want creative people in the goal, someone who can make things happen," 
Yancey said. "Well, some of the stuff I've seen goalies do has been pretty 
creative. Besides, if you had a ball hitting you in the face all the time, 
you'd have a screw loose, too."

RANCHERS SWITCH TO RAISING OSTRICHES, DEER AND BUFFALO

The entrepreneurial spirit thrives in the U.S. livestock industry, with farmers 
and ranchers raising new and exotic livestock. 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, domesticated deer are raised in a feedlot where cattle were once 
fed, and ostriches roam on a Texas ranch next to quarter horses and 
Thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
"The ostrich industry is over 100 years old, but not in the United States," 
said Cooper Campbell, who started raising the birds on his Odessa, Tex., horse 
ranch three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell expects in four to six years that there will be enough commercially 
raised ostriches to sustain markets for the meat, feathers and hide. Until 
then, the best market will be for breeding stock. 
</P>
<P>
Newborn and young ostriches are expensive, costing $6,000 for a pair of 
3-month-old chicks and escalating to $45,000 to $75,000 for a pair of 
3-year-olds, Campbell said. However, prices should drop sharply once the 
industry matures and populations increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of economic hurdles face these fledgling livestock industries. Markets 
have to be developed for the meat, hides and breeding stock, and government 
standards for the meat must be established. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a large commercial ostrich industry, and meat from the giant 
birds is marketed throughout Africa and Europe, said Campbell, who is a 
director of the American Ostrich Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a lean, red meat that more closely resembles beef than anything else," 
he said. It is low in cholesterol and fat and can be processed into steaks and 
roasts. 
</P>
<P>
Better-established in the United States is the market for ostrich hides, which 
are used for jackets, boots, belts and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, Dennis Gibson's feedlots were empty for six years after he quit 
the cattle-feeding business in 1981. Then in 1987 he began commercially raising 
fallow deer, a domesticated Asian deer that is more disease resistant than the 
white tail and mule deer indigenous to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His herd of 250 deer is primarily for breeding purposes, and he regularly sells 
stags to other breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"The deer are flighty but have no trouble adapting to the northern climate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In five years, Gibson hopes that supplies will be sufficient to develop and 
sustain marketing channels for venison. Local cattle slaughter plants presently 
process the small amount of commercial venison on the market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Minnesota extension service has supported deer farming with a 
symposium and educational material. Deer farming is successful in New Zealand, 
where there is a commercial herd of 700,000 head, and the industry is growing 
by 30% a year, the university said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., there isn't enough product (venison) available to establish a 
market, but we take 25% of the venison New Zealand exports," said R.M. Jordan, 
a University of Minnesota extension animal scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Venison contains 3% to 4% fat, compared to 35% for high-quality beef, Gibson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still in its infancy is the commercial raising of native American bison, 
commonly known as the American buffalo. The University of Minnesota extension 
service reports about 90,000 head in the United States, of which 85% is under 
private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for bison meat has increased in some areas because of its leanness and 
perceived lower cholesterol content.

Dr. Arnold O. Beckman, founder of Fullerton-based Beckman Instruments and a 
leading philanthropist, was presented with the Illinois Institute of 
Technology's Henry Townley Heald Award. The award, named for IIT's first 
president, is presented annually by the university to an individual for 
professional and personal achievements. Beckman, a native of Illinois, attended 
the University of Illinois and in 1928 received his doctorate in photochemistry 
from Caltech. In 1935, while a Caltech faculty member, he founded Beckman 
Instruments, a major supplier of laboratory instruments and related products 
for diagnostics and life sciences. Beckman lives in Corona del Mar. Compiled by

COUNTY HAS 10 OF STATE'S 100 LARGEST PRIVATE FIRMS 
</P>

Orange County is home to 10 of the 100 largest privately held companies in 
California, and four local firms are in the top 20, according to an annual 
survey released this week by California Business magazine, 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Financial Co., a Newport Beach insurance and pension company with 
annual revenues of $2.09 billion, again heads the list of the county's largest 
private firms. Statewide, Pacific Financial ranked fourth, behind Safeway 
Stores (recently taken private in a leveraged buyout), Bechtel Group, and Levi 
Strauss &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent new entry on this year's list is McGuinness Group, a Newport 
Beach enterprise that operates as a wholesale distributor of financial products 
such as insurance policies, annuities and limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
The company posted revenues of $783 million last year to rank No. 17 in the 
state and No. 4 in the county, according to California Business, but a company 
spokesman noted that the figure represented total sales rather than operating 
revenues. He declined to provide a figure for operating revenues and added that 
the firm had not been included last year because it had not been approached by 
the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Another, less lofty newcomer to the top 100, Irvine-based Brinderson Corp., was 
also overlooked in the past. Brinderson, a heavy construction and real estate 
firm, placed 75th with revenues of $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
California Business acknowledged that some companies may not be listed simply 
because the editors were not aware of them or because they refused to provide 
revenue figures. Unlike publicly traded firms, private companies are not 
required to divulge any financial information. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue figures which appear in the magazine survey were provided by the 
individual bfirms, and any company that refused to provide numbers was 
automatically excluded from the list.

Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center last week received 
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin testing a laser 
manufactured by Tustin-based Trimedyne Inc. for opening clogged blood vessels 
in the heart. Fountain Valley is the 11th medical center approved for the 
coronary laser trials. The hospital long has used the Trimedyne laser in legs 
and has had a high success rate, a hospital spokeswoman said. Dr. Steven 
Schiff, a Fountain Valley staff cardiologist, is the chief investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne marketing director Bill Worthen said coronary trials of the laser 
catheter have been under way for two years and are expected to be completed at 
the end of this year. Worthen said the company has asked for approval to expand 
the trials to 15 centers to collect more data. "You can never have enough data 
when it comes to this," he said. Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer

HOTEL AT CAL STATE FULLERTON OPENING NEW MARKETING POSSIBILITIES FOR CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just in time for the fall semester, Marriott is going to school. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 15, the hotel chain plans to open the Fullerton Marriott -- the West's 
only hotel on a state university's grounds. 
</P>
<P>
With the move, Cal State Fullerton joins a handful of universities across the 
country that have allowed hotels to open on campus. But Bethesda, Md.-based 
Marriott Corp. apparently is the first major hotel chain to own an on-campus 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The project, however, was long in the making. In fact, the Fullerton Marriott 
became a reality only after a bitter decade-long fight involving college sports 
enthusiasts, university faculty and developers. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton area has been growing and "will very nicely sustain" the hotel, 
said Gordon Lambourne, a Marriott Corp. spokesman. "The university area is 
dynamic. . . . And there are a lot of visitors to the university." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Traffic Area 
</P>
<P>
For Marriott, the location provides the six-story hotel with a steady stream of 
customers -- traveling professors, parents, alumni and athletes -- not to 
mention nearby businesses such as Hughes Aircraft Co., Hunt-Wesson Foods, and 
Beckman Instruments Inc. For the university, there is more space to host more 
conferences and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
The $20-million property is on a 3.1-acre plot leased to the city's 
Redevelopment Agency, which in turn has leased the land to Marriott. So the 
city and the university will get revenue from Marriott, while the hotel chain 
gets a long-term use of a valuable site in North Orange County. Cal State 
Fullerton will eventually wind up owning the hotel because under the contract 
the Fullerton Marriott reverts to university ownership in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton is not the first to enter the hotel business. The basic 
idea dates back to the 1950s, when Cornell University and Michigan State added 
on-campus hotels. Today, campuses in Syracuse, N.Y.; Indianapolis; Wellesley, 
Mass.; and East Lansing, Mich., all boast on-premises hotels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time-Share Concept 
</P>
<P>
And other entrepreneurs are looking to get with the school spirit. One joint 
venture project -- Varsity Clubs of America -- is planning to build high-priced 
hotels near major universities and sell interests in them, in arrangements 
similar to a time-share arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The concept, largely designed to appeal to college sports fans, would give 
those who bought interests in the right to stay at a hotel during specified 
times, with club members paying more for the most in-demand seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Sports is also a drawing card at the Marriott Fullerton, which is near the site 
of a proposed sports complex, including a new football stadium. Construction of 
the complex, however, has been delayed to at least next year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cal State Fullerton officials said they are convinced that the 10-year 
battle to build the hotel -- overcoming lawsuits, hotel and developer pullouts 
and disgruntled faculty members -- was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, on Nutwood Avenue just off the Orange Freeway, is an ideal use for 
land that was part of a parking lot, officials said. And proceeds from the 
facility can be used to finance the nearby sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
But there were some anxious moments before the proposed hotel finally was 
approved three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Objections Lodged 
</P>
<P>
Hilton Hotels Corp. originally was interested in the project, but dropped out 
in the early 1980s after an environmental group opposed the hotel and 
unsuccessfully tried to block it in court. That same opposition also caused a 
Houston developer to back out. By 1985, economic conditions for new hotels had 
soured. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton went back to the drawing boards in December, 1985, and 
Marriott Corp. rescued the project by finally agreeing to take it over. 
</P>
<P>
But within a year, the hotel faced its biggest battle when Cal State Fullerton 
Faculty Senate criticized the development, complaining about the growth of 
sports on campus. Critics argued that the hotel was being built to spur 
construction of the sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Faculty Senate endorsed the hotel and the sports complex by a 
resounding 38-4 vote and Fullerton's Redevelopment Agency followed, giving its 
official nod. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly completed hotel has 225 rooms -- fewer than the average Marriott, 
which has about 400 rooms. But general manager Curtis Dean is quick to point 
out that it is a full-service property with the usual amenities such as a 
concierge's lounge, valet parking, and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stiff Competition 
</P>
<P>
Marriott officials declined to reveal expected revenue or the profit split with 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Already, however, the Fullerton Marriott is looking at offering special rates 
to the university and negotiating with nearby businesses to guarantee overnight 
accommodations for employees in town for training courses. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Marriott will face some stiff competition in the North Orange County 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rate in the area has been only 61.5% for the first seven months 
of 1989, according to the accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster, which 
monitors the hotel industry. That's far below the overall countywide occupancy 
rate of 71% for the same period, Pannell Kerr data shows. 
</P>
<P>
The lackluster occupancy figures haven't been helped any by the fact that new 
or newly renovated hotels have been opening their doors throughout the North 
County area. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past few years, at least six hotels have opened in the areas of 
Fullerton, Brea, Anaheim, Anaheim Hills, Placentia and Yorba Linda, said Sandra 
Louvier, a hotel consulting specialist with the Costa Mesa office of Laventhol 
&amp; Horwath, another accounting firm that monitors the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Competition Ahead 
</P>
<P>
And even more competition is on the way. Five more hotels are under 
construction or on the drawing boards for the area, Louvier said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 135 rooms in that market in 1986. By the end of the year, there 
will be 1,145," Louvier said. "It's going to be an extremely competitive area." 
</P>
<P>
Still, hotel experts predict that Marriott's reputation -- and nationwide 
reservation system -- are strong drawing cards that could prove to be the key 
difference for the on-campus hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Put a no-name on the same site and it would be a problem," said Rick Schwartz, 
manager of management advisory services with Pannell Kerr in Irvine. "For most 
people, that wouldn't be the top site in town. But Marriott seems to create 
miracles wherever it goes. They just have tremendous drawing power." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

STUDY SEES CONTINUED JOB GROWTH IN COUNTY, OUTPACING STATE, U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Job growth in Orange County through the year 2000 will not match the frantic 
pace of the last two decades but will continue to outpace California and the 
nation as a whole, according to a new study of the region's economic trends 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The county will add 319,100 new jobs from 1990 to 2000, predicted Robert K. 
Arnold, chairman of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy 
and chief economist for the real estate firm Marcus &amp; Millichap. Job growth 
will total 33.8% for the period, against 26.2% growth in California and 13.4% 
in the United States as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
But next year, as the national economy slows, the county will add just 32,200 
new jobs, Arnold predicted, in contrast with about 34,400 this year and 46,000 
in 1988. The 4% yearly job growth rates of 1970s and 1980s, moreover, are being 
replaced by more modest 2% to 3% compound annual gains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generally Positive Forecast 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's projections are based on a generally positive national economic 
forecast that anticipates significant export growth, a decline in the budget 
deficit because of Social Security trust fund surpluses, low interest rates and 
increased government investment in education and infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County -- as in the rest of the country -- employment growth will be 
driven by robust expansion in business services and wholesale trade and modest 
gains in the high-tech manufacturing sector, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
While Arnold's bullish outlook on the county is shared by many economists, some 
believe that he is a tad optimistic. Phillip Bincent, an economist with First 
Interstate Bank, said the job-growth figures are "within the range of 
possibility" but fail to account for some possible obstacles to continued 
economic buoyancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress on Transportation 
</P>
<P>
"A very important issue is how much progress is made on the transportation 
problem -- it's fundamental," Bincent said. Failure to solve the traffic 
problem will add strength to the slow-growth movement and thus threaten the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
Bincent was also pessimistic about the possibility of a reduction in the budget 
deficit and a significant expansion in export industries. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wahed, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank, said his own study showed 
that county employment would grow at 2.8% annually over the next 20 years -- 
even higher than the 2.5% anticipated by Arnold.

DEPTH FALTERS IN FULLERTON'S 'CURSE,' GOLDEN WEST'S 'RAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH

Cal State Fullerton's "Curse of the Starving Class" misses the beat in finding 
a rhythm between Sam Shepard's wigged-out characters. And without that, this 
perverse, problematic black comedy can turn into a lot of sound and fury 
signifying little. 
</P>
<P>
"Curse," written in 1978, is considered one of Shepard's most autobiographical 
works, supposedly reflecting his early life in rural San Gabriel Valley in the 
1950s. If so, young Sam had a very rough time of it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the Shepard family, we have the ominous Tate clan, all living on an 
avocado farm gone to seed, in a ramshackle house that's more war zone than 
home. There's Weston (Christopher K. Hull), the drunk and raging father; Ella 
(Karlie Cook), his desperate wife; Emma (Sylvia Biller), the savvy 15-year-old 
who dreams about going to Mexico, and Wesley (Christopher Huskin), the only son 
who is too much like his father for his (and everybody else's) own good. 
</P>
<P>
This is a nuclear family imploding all over the place. Loyalties are damned and 
it's everybody for himself or herself. Day-to-day life is made up of both petty 
and major struggles, the biggest being who's going to profit off the sale of 
the farm. Both mom and dad have grand ideas -- Weston wants to take the money 
to make a getaway to Mexico, Ella wants to go to Europe. As usual with Shepard, 
these are subversive high jinks dipped in blood. 
</P>
<P>
To connect with these people and to understand fully what Shepard is getting at 
(the taint of generational guilt, the impossibility of intimacy), we have to 
grasp almost intuitively what they mean to each other. That requires direction 
that doesn't wander much and acting that is pointed and revelatory. 
</P>
<P>
We don't get that at Cal State Fullerton. Alvin Keller's direction is too 
sporadic, especially in the pacing. At times this production picks up the 
energy Shepard intended, but more often it plods along, letting us drift from 
the dynamic at hand. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, with the possible exception of Cook, seems lost in interpreting these 
characters. Cook has an idea of how the situation has paralyzed Ella and plays 
her with a relatively tight focus. 
</P>
<P>
But Weston is little more than bluster, a man of noise without much motivation 
shown for all the racket. Huskin's handling of Wesley is even less revealing. 
It's the most difficult and demanding role, for sure, but Huskin doesn't give 
him any tautness or depth. Here, he's sort of whiny, which belies the fact that 
this is a character beset by the darkest internalizing. 
</P>
<P>
Biller has the tough task of playing a precocious adolescent and she responds 
with a bunch of cliched and unconvincing mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
On the technical side, Todd Muffatti's set gets the job done well enough but it 
could have given more of an idea of a world in decline -- it's all a little too 
neat. Susan Hallman's lighting is effective. 
</P>
<P>
'CURSE OF THE STARVING CLASS'

The Costa Mesa City Council has filled three remaining spots on the 
seven-member board of the new Costa Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Corp., an 
agency formed in August that hopes to generate millions of dollars for the 
city's arts programs. Named Monday were Edna G. Bradley of Costa Mesa, who 
belongs to a support group of the Orange County Performing Arts Center; Russell 
Cox, general manager of the Red Lion, Orange County Airport hotel; and Edgar 
Fawcett, general manager of the County Side Inn hotel. The board's first 
meeting will be announced.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: CAMERATA BERN'S 'UNTRENDY HERESIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By current concert standards, the Camerata Bern commits a number of untrendy 
heresies. 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not that the 15-member Swiss ensemble plays without a conductor. 
Several groups work that way now. And that's an old-fashioned concept anyway. 
The Camerata's first fiddler serves as the conductor, just as the concertmaster 
did in the days of Gluck, Handel and Telemann. 
</P>
<P>
Nope, the Camerata's heresies are different. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking recent trends, these musicians make no apologies about playing old 
works on modern instruments. They do not try to be sticklers about "authentic" 
Baroque performance practices. And, horror of horrors, they prefer Bach 
keyboard concertos on the piano, not the harpsichord. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, grab the smelling salts for the purists. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the group ventures into surprisingly unorthodox mix of 
repertory. On Thursday, it will play works by John Dowland, both J.S. and 
C.P.E. Bach, Schoenberg, Zoltan Kodaly and Heinz Holliger at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. The program is sponsored by the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
And for such transgressions, the group has taken some flak from critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but we just don't care," concertmaster Thomas Furi said in a recent phone 
interview from Bern, Switzerland. "We like Bach concertos very much in the 
piano version, although we also have used the harpsichord. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like the sound of Baroque historical instruments. Modern instruments 
sound to my ear better than so-called Baroque instruments -- most of which were 
built in the last 10 to 15 years anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Furi calls the "authenticity" movement "very snobbish." 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely convinced that it all is a question of fashion," he said. 
"Right now, many people in the Baroque movement have found a very tricky way to 
sell their records. In 10 years, we'll look back and say, this was a fashion, 
it was quite good, it was helpful, it made things go on. But it's a matter of 
people who see how business goes . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "If you play music that way, you should change many other things, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Those who insist on authentic-performance practices, for instance, "should 
never play in a big hall with 2,000 to 3,000 people because the music was never 
meant to be heard like that. We don't believe in this kind of philosophy where 
you drive everything back to the state of that time. In that case, we should 
also change our clothes and everything." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the ensemble tries to "create a personal style, which is certainly 
influenced by certain tendencies today. 
</P>
<P>
"We listen regularly to new recordings and we try to let ourselves be inspired 
by certain things -- the transparency of the playing or the liveliness of the 
dance movements." 
</P>
<P>
And especially by singers. "I'm quite inspired by that," Furi said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to find a common-sense answer, to do what we think is the most natural. 
But it is hard to say what is natural. All these questions we have no definite 
answer for. We have certain convictions, and two years ago, we may have had 
slightly different convictions. Times change, but we grow. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I'm leading the whole thing, but in preparing the music, everybody 
can give his opinion. We're democratic, as far as it's possible." 
</P>
<P>
Furi called the variety of the program in Costa Mesa "typical for us."

"We like very much to play a variety of styles within the same evening -- 
because it's fun for us. And, I think, for us, individual styles improve. They 
get more profile. When you play a modern piece after a Baroque piece, the two 
styles have more shape somehow. It's a personal conviction." 
</P>
<P>
Furi joined the Camerata in 1967, when he was 20. "I was the youngest member 
then," he said. "Now I'm 42 and by far the oldest." He took over as 
concertmaster in 1979, returning after a departure to pursue solo work, other 
opportunities as a concertmaster and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the ensemble, which operates on a yearly budget of about $370,000, 
gives between 40 and 50 concerts a year in Switzerland, makes several 
recordings and usually tours in Scandinavia and Germany. The group also tours 
the United States and beyond about every three years. (It was last in 
California in 1986.) 
</P>
<P>
But that is not enough to live on, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we were doubling the number of concerts, you could not make a living," 
he said. "That's why the group is directed to young musicians, before they get 
other jobs. The average age is 30 to 32 . . . 
</P>
<P>
"To earn enough money to live, they have to teach or play in other ensembles. 
Often it is a problem for us to combine all that, to find the time to rehearse. 
People are not always in the same town, mainly around Bern. It is difficult. 
But it creates a certain spirit of idealism. 
</P>
<P>
"The musicians stick together. They feel that somehow it's worth it to do work 
like that together, maybe just because we're not so well paid. In music, it is 
dangerous if people are too well paid. People get lazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Camerata Bern, led by concertmaster Thomas Furi, will play music by J.S. 
and C.P.E. Bach, John Dowland, Schoenberg and other composers at 8 p.m. on 
Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in 
Costa Mesa. Soloist will be pianist Emile Naoumoff. The concert is sponsored by 
the Orange County Philharmonic Society. Tickets: $8 to $25. Information: (714) 
646-6277. 
</P>

<P>
MORE ON THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY SCENE: Gail Eichenthal is first up today to 
start a five-part Orange County Philharmonic Society-sponsored lecture series 
on classical music. Her topic: "Describing the Indescribable: Talking about 
Classical Music." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very personal talk," Eichenthal said in a recent phone interview. 
"In a sense, this is a credo of a classical music broadcaster -- (talking 
about) the things that are impossible about the job and the things that make it 
incredibly rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
Eichenthal will focus on several works she calls "pivotal": Mahler's 10th 
Symphony, Debussy's "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune" and Wagner's "Tristan 
und Isolde." 
</P>
<P>
"They're examples of very important and pivotal works that I think one can 
appreciate even more when one knows some of the history behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York, Eichenthal, 36, grew up in Los Angeles. She studied piano at 
UCLA and in her final year became the winner of the Abram Chasins Classical 
Music Radio Internship at KUSC-FM in Los Angeles. She serves in a number of 
capacities, including executive producer, when she left the station in June "to 
pursue other areas." 
</P>
<P>
She now produces and hosts the the Los Angeles Philharmonic national radio 
broadcasts, serves as a movie critic for CBS Radio and works at KNX-AM as a 
part-time writer and reporter. 
</P>
<P>
She continues to give preconcert lectures and talks on her favorite subject. 
Also she concedes "the absolute impossibility of really putting your finger on 
what makes certain works great." 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's impossible to pin down all these things, you can gain an 
awful lot by learning some of the history behind them," she said. "Even the 
music can sound different. That's my contention." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Eichenthal will speak on classical music at 6:30 p.m. at the Four Seasons 
Hotel, 690 Newport Center Drive, in Newport Beach. Her talk, "Describing the 
Indescribable: Talking about Classical Music," is the first in a five-part 
lecture series sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. Series 
tickets range from $35 to $50. Individual tickets, on a space-available basis, 
are $10. Information: (714) 642-8232.

DOW SOARS 40 TO RECORD 2,754.56 AFTER TRADERS GO ON LATE BUYING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market surged to a record high Tuesday as traders shook off fears of 
higher interest rates and an unexpected profit squeeze in some high-tech 
industries to pour money into blue chip issues and consumer stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average soared 40.84 points to 2,754.56, a 
stratosphere unsampled since Sept. 1, when the Dow peaked at 2,752.09. A wave 
of blue chip buying at the end of the day's trading pushed the average up 20 
points in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts cautioned that the broad market did not fair so well as the bellwether 
Dow industrials and noted that New York Stock Exchange volume of 182.55 million 
shares, while well above the sluggish average of the past month, was not much 
stronger than the average daily trading so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not exuberant," cautioned Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty 
First Securities, in New York. "You'd think, in the light of the past few 
years, it would be well over 200 million with a gain like this." 
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note, Stovall added: "The market has been experiencing a 
lateral correction for the past month, and that's now over. The market had 
jitters over the high dollar, the junk bond scare and then IBM's profit 
decline. Now the market is focusing on a new theme: disinflation. 
</P>
<P>
"(Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan is moving toward a 1950s-type 
pattern of slow money growth and low inflation, and the markets believe 
interest rates will go lower. There's a lot of cash out there, and on a 
historical basis, a lot of stocks are not all that expensive." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, held its 
monthly meeting Tuesday, but as usual the panel was tight-lipped about any 
decisions it might have made. Nevertheless, the bond market was flushed with 
optimism as prices rose and yields slumped in the credit markets. The 
Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up more than $5 for every $1,000 of 
face value in late afternoon trading, while its yield slumped to 8.16% from 
late Monday's 8.21%. 
</P>
<P>
Stovall and other analysts were impressed by the market's resilience in the 
face of continued weakness by IBM, which last week revealed sharply lower 
earnings projections for the third quarter and on Tuesday announced price 
concessions to stimulate sales. 
</P>
<P>
The computer giant, a component of the 30 industrial issues that make up the 
Dow average, slumped another 2 5/8 to 106, a 52-week low, and other technology 
issues suffered also. Supercomputer maker Cray Research was down 2 1/4 to 38 
after the company said it planned to cut its work force by 400, or 7%, in 
response to weak demand for its products. Hewlett-Packard slipped 1 to 48 1/4, 
and Digital Equipment gave up 2 1/4 to close at 88 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Get Safe Stocks' 
</P>
<P>
Businessland continued its fall, losing 1 3/4 to 10 1/8 after it said 
third-quarter earnings would be below estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"If IBM goes down and nothing else in the Dow does, people say, 'It's time to 
get back in the market and put my money to work,' " said Edward F. Nicoski of 
Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis. "I think the correction is over, 
but now you'll see the market leadership changing. Right now it's over for 
technology, and everybody wants defensive, consumer-oriented issues. When IBM 
falls, then you go get safe stocks like Procter &amp; Gamble and Philip Morris, 
where you don't get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, it was precisely such consumer stocks in the Dow Jones that led the 
upward march. Philip Morris, on a tear in recent weeks following an announced 
stock split and a new low-smoke cigarette product, added 5 3/8 to close at 172, 
a new high. Procter &amp; Gamble added 3 1/8 to 124 5/8. American Express, 
another gainer in recent trading, rose 2 1/4 to 38 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
The most active issue Tuesday was USX, up 1 3/8 on rumors that financier and 
buyout specialist Carl C. Icahn was adding to his existing 11.4% stake in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing was up 3 1/8 to 59 3/4. The aircraft giant's unionized machinists were 
voting on whether to accept a new three-year contract, thereby stabilizing some 
costs for another few years. After the market closed, however, it was announced 
that the machinists had turned down their tentative agreement with Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
221.51 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed higher, propelled by a strong opening on Wall Street. 
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 blue chips closed 29.4 points 
higher at 2,318.6. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices dropped sharply in Tokyo, mostly on a flood of sell orders from 
investment trusts. The Nikkei index fell 256.60 to close at 35,366.37.

THE BIG BLUES; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER EARLY FORECASTS OF RECORD PROFITS, IBM IS SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI , Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the year IBM was supposed to get its bottom-line act together. 
</P>
<P>
But, barring a near-miracle, International Business Machines Corp. will finish 
1989 without matching its record $6.58-billion profit of five years earlier, 
and without much prospect of doing it next year. 
</P>
<P>
IBM stunned Wall Street last week by announcing that third-quarter profits 
would be well below earlier estimates, and possibly below the earnings of $1.2 
billion for the same period in 1988. Further, the company acknowledged that 
profits for all of 1989 could dip below the $5.8 billion earned last year. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in six months that IBM had jolted investors with news 
that its profits would be lower than expected. And several analysts fear that, 
without significant changes, things are going to get worse at IBM before they 
get better. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the last we've heard from IBM on earnings drops," said Steven 
Cohen, an analyst with SoundView Financial in Stamford, Conn. "I'm very 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that IBM hasn't tried to boost its profits. Over the last three years, 
the company has closed several plants, eliminated 6,500 jobs, induced more than 
15,000 employees to take early retirement and transferred 20,000 workers from 
desk jobs to the sales force to trim costs and bring in more business. Taking 
their cue directly from Chairman John Akers, IBM engineers and sales staffers 
have been hustling and paying attention to their customers as never before. 
</P>
<P>
But the job of overhauling and refocusing the world's largest computer maker 
has proven far tougher than initially anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's depressing," said John Jones of Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco 
brokerage firm. "IBM is on the right track, but the turnaround process is far 
more difficult than anyone ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing on Price 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, IBM is hardly struggling to stay afloat. It is still among the most 
profitable high-technology companies in the nation and has been actively 
investing in young companies with promising technologies. But its profit margin 
is well below that of the early 1980s, and it shows little sign of immediate 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to many analysts is the realization that IBM is 
increasingly being forced to compete on price, a particularly difficult 
battlefront for a company whose overhead costs run 50% higher than industry 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, analysts say, IBM had competed by claiming that its products and 
service were superior. But that edge has been eroding, leaving the company to 
slug it out on price. 
</P>
<P>
Just Tuesday, the company announced rebates, free software and instant credit 
with the purchase of certain personal computers. It has also cut prices on 
selected mainframe models and other products. 
</P>
<P>
This year, IBM has also used its vast cash resources to finance an attractive 
leasing program designed to keep customers from defecting to other 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, IBM has blamed its latest problems on a strong U.S. dollar, which 
diminishes the value of foreign sales; delayed shipments of a new disk drive 
memory system, and an increasing number of customers deciding to lease 
equipment, rather than buying it outright. IBM officials declined to be 
interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the reasons, the results on the bottom line are the same. "If 
it's not one thing, it's another with them," said Ulric Weil, a computer market 
analyst in Washington. "There's always something marring the beautiful picture 
IBM is trying to draw." Analysts say the disk drive delay and the planned 
unveiling of a new top-of-the-line mainframe computer system within the next 18 
months have combined with a general softening of the once-torrid buying pace. 
As a result of the upcoming product transition, customers are more interested 
in leasing equipment, both to save money and guard against buying machines that 
will soon become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sucker for a Bargain' 
</P>
<P>
And, analysts say, IBM has been more than willing to write those leases, 
especially at attractively discounted prices. According to SoundView 
Financial's Cohen, IBM's leasing business was 68% higher during the first half 
of 1989 than in the comparable period last year. 
</P>
<P>
To some analysts, IBM has been fueling demand for its products in the current 
soft market by making its prices too attractive to ignore, a tactic that may 
generate sales, but only at the expense of profits. "Everyone is a sucker for a 
bargain," said Weil. "Even in a world of tough competition, if you discount 
enough, someone will take you up on your offer. And you know that if IBM could 
sell it at full list price, they would." 
</P>
<P>
Although IBM says the company generates more revenues from a three- or 
five-year lease than an outright sale, the profits are significantly lower the 
year the lease is booked, a factor that unnerves short-term investors on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
But even for the long term, say some analysts, the trend toward leasing signals

"IBM has been ineffective in differentiating its product from the competition," 
said Cohen, "and it's been forced to resort to competing on price to push its 
product out the door. The problem is that its costs are too high for this 
strategy, so its earnings are caught between a rock and a hard place."

MCCAW DEALS SEEN AS EFFORT TO PUT PRESSURE ON LIN 
</P>

McCaw Cellular Communications Tuesday announced a pair of billion-dollar-plus 
cellular telephone deals apparently designed to increase pressure on Lin 
Broadcasting to agree to its hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said it agreed buy out Metromedia Inc.'s interest 
in a New York cellular telephone system for $1.9 billion. To help finance that 
purchase, McCaw said it reached a separate agreement to sell its interest in 
several Southeastern cellular systems to Contel Corp. for $1.3 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The New York acquisition hinges on whether Lin Broadcasting, which owns 45% of 
the franchise, exercises its right to buy Metromedia's interest by matching 
McCaw's offer. Some analysts said the McCaw proposal was another attempt to put 
more pressure on New York-based Lin, which McCaw has been aggressively pursuing 
since June with a $5.8-billion takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates the seriousness with which McCaw is going after Lin," said 
John Reddan, an analyst with the investment firm Moran &amp; Associates Inc. in 
Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Reddan said McCaw is trying to establish a market value for Lin's New York 
assets and is "calling Lin's bluff" on its stance that the overall company is 
worth more than the $110-a-share, or $5.8 billion, offered by McCaw. McCaw's 
offer for the 45.7% Metromedia interest equals $275 per potential customer, or 
what is known in the cellular industry as a "pop." McCaw's bid for all of Lin 
is equal to $250 per pop, Reddan said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, if Lin doesn't match McCaw's offer for Metromedia's share 
of its New York partnership, Lin can't credibly argue that the company as a 
whole is worth more than the McCaw offer. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lin can't match McCaw's offer "without crippling" its proposed merger 
with BellSouth Corp., said Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst for the 
investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advantage Seen for McCaw 
</P>
<P>
In a move to thwart McCaw's hostile bid, Lin in September proposed merging its 
cellular properties with those of Atlanta-based BellSouth, along with 
distributing a special $20-a-share dividend to all of its shareholders. As part 
of the plan, Lin also said it would go ahead with a spinoff of its seven 
televisions into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
But McCaw now has the advantage in the battle for Lin, Friedberg said. If Lin 
buys out Metromedia and still pays the proposed dividend, he said, the merged 
Lin-BellSouth organization would likely have far more debt per pop than McCaw, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Friedberg said, if McCaw acquires Metromedia's stake in the 
New York cellular venture, Lin probably wouldn't be able to run the operation 
as profitably. 
</P>
<P>
Lin Vice President Michael Plouf said his company doesn't see McCaw's maneuvers 
"as being a negative development at all." The company has 45 days to decide 
whether it will buy the Metromedia stake, he said, but "the prospect of owning 
90% (of the New York venture) is very attractive." Lin previously tried to 
force Metromedia to sell its interests in New York and Philadelphia. But a New 
York state court ruled that Lin has only the right of first refusal if 
Metromedia decided to sell its stake and could not force a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Reddan said he believes that McCaw will increase its cash offer for Lin to 
about $120 a share. But in agreeing to sell its properties in the Southeast to 
Contel, McCaw has established values for BellSouth's contribution to the 
proposed merger with Lin because the Contel properties are in cities where 
BellSouth also has cellular interests. That will give Lin's holders a basis to 
compare the proposed BellSouth merger to whatever cash price McCaw offers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw has also eliminated a potential rival for Lin in coming to terms with 
Atlanta-based Contel, Reddan asserted, because Contel threatened to bid for Lin 
if McCaw didn't make it a partner in the raid on Lin. Under the agreement, 
Contel would acquire McCaw's cellular interests in Memphis, Nashville and other 
Tennessee cities; Louisville and Lexington, Ky., and in Birmingham and four 
other Alabama cities. The $1.3-billion price equals $205 per pop, Contel said.

Bristol-Myers, Squibb Holders OK Merger: Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. 
stockholders approved their companies' $11.5-billion merger into Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co., which will be world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company. The 
merger is a further step in the consolidation of the global pharmaceuticals 
industry. Analysts say mergers are encouraged by the industry's stiff 
competition and development costs of hundreds of millions of dollars for the 
introduction of a single drug. The merger will take effect today, Bristol-Myers 
officials said. The combined company will be headquartered in New York.

Lincoln Bailout Cost Slashed: Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan will cost taxpayers 
between $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion to sell or close, significantly less than 
industry experts had predicted, the nation's top thrift regulator said during a 
visit to Southern California. M. Danny Wall, director of the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, said in an interview that regulators do not expect Irvine-based 
Lincoln to be the costliest thrift clean-up ever, as many analysts had 
projected. Industry experts previously have pegged the clean-up cost at $2 
billion to $2.5 billion.

BANKRUPT DEFENSE FIRM CAN RESUME SOME PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday approved a request from Hughes Aircraft Co. 
that would allow a bankrupt Brea defense contractor, Micronics International, 
to resume limited production of a problem-plagued missile component. 
</P>
<P>
Micronics closed its Brea defense plant on Aug. 29 after the Defense Department 
refused to accept delivery of the company's safety and arming devices, also 
known as fuzes. Two weeks later, Micronics filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials have said the Micronics devices have repeatedly 
failed tests, bringing into question the reliability of the $4,500 part. 
Micronics officials have said the devices work fine. 
</P>
<P>
The Micronics shutdown threatens to delay or halt production on some key 
missile programs, because the Brea firm is the sole supplier of the parts used 
in the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Phoenix, Sidewinder, 
Sparrow and other missile programs. The devices are used to detonate warheads 
or prevent them from detonating prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing Tuesday in Santa Ana, a Hughes representative said the company 
will be unable to deliver AMRAAM missiles to the Air Force by the first quarter 
of 1990, as its contract stipulates, unless Micronics is allowed to resume 
production. Micronics supplies arming devices to Hughes for use on the AMRAAM. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, Hughes said the Micronics shutdown has already resulted in the 
company falling behind schedule in delivering AMRAAMs to the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Bankruptcy Judge James M. Barr approved the Hughes request, saying it 
would allow "the debtor (Micronics) to get back up and running again." 
</P>
<P>
Micronics laid off more than 100 employees when it closed the Brea plant. 
Micronics officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and it was 
unclear when production at the Brea plant would resume, for what period of time 
and how many employees will be rehired.

More Office Supplies for State: Staples, a Boston-based office supply warehouse 
chain, said it will launch its first California store in Los Angeles next 
August and will open as many as 34 stores and a central processing and 
distribution center in the state by 1993. Staples, which currently operates 36 
stores in nine states, said it expects the expansion to reduce expected 
earnings in fiscal 1991 but will contribute to earnings after that.

Fireman's Fund Takes a Hit From Hugo: The insurer, based in Novato, Calif., 
said the financial impact of claims caused by last month's Hurricane Hugo will 
amount to about $35 million to $40 million pretax in the company's third 
quarter. The cost reflects anticipated reimbursements from reinsurers that 
agreed to take on a share of possible claims.

PEOPLE: NOMURA SECURITIES TAPS WALL STREET VETERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's Nomura Securities Co. has named a veteran of Wall Street as co-chairman 
of its U.S. securities operation, a move aimed at giving it an American 
identity and management style. 
</P>
<P>
Max C. Chapman Jr., the 46-year-old former president and chief executive of 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said he hoped to put a Wall Street stamp on the U.S. 
operations of the world's largest securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Nomura is deadly serious about trying to find a way to marry their 
system and the good parts of the American system together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman -- who served as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve and played 
football for four years at the University of North Carolina -- will share the 
top job at Nomura with the current chairman, Katsuya Takanashi. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura has invested heavily in its New York operation but has yet to show 
consistent success. Its U.S. operations lost about $18 million in the year 
ended Sept. 30, 1988, and Nomura has reduced its broker-dealer staff to 550 
from a peak of 650 before the 1987 stock market crash, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who spent his entire career at Kidder, said he resigned from the firm 
earlier this year after being passed over for the job of chief executive of 
Kidder's parent company, Kidder, Peabody Group Inc., which is majority owned by 
General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura is the last of Japan's big four securities firms to have an American in 
the rank of co-chairman or vice chairman. Chapman will serve as co-chairman of 
both Nomura Securities International Inc. and Nomura Holding America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura's main business in the United States is funneling money from Japanese 
investors into the U.S. stock and bond markets. It also works with Japanese 
companies doing business in the United States. Its goal is to pick up more 
American customers, particularly corporations that need sophisticated financial 
services.

DIVORCE PACT CHANGES LEADERSHIP AT JOHNSON

George E. and Joan B. Johnson started one of the nation's largest black-owned 
companies together with $250 in 1954, but the family ties that bound the 
company and the couple have come undone. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson signed the company chairmanship and the bulk of its shares over to her 
this week in their divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson Products Co. makes hair care and cosmetic products under such brand 
names as Gentle-Treatment, Ultra Sheen and Classy Curl. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a family company and she wanted to preserve the company for the 
family, the children. And she obviously feels that she can make this company 
into something even better than it is today," Bernard Rinella, Joan Johnson's 
divorce lawyer, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She and the couple's eldest son, Eric G. Johnson, will seek to guide Johnson 
Products back to profitability after eight straight years of losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Company Treasurer 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed up 12.5 cents Tuesday at $2.50 a share on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
George Johnson, 62, who had been the company's principal shareholder, turned 
his stock over to his former wife and resigned as chairman and chief executive 
on Monday, when the divorce was granted. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Johnson, 60, formerly the company treasurer, replaced him as chairman and 
now owns or controls 61% of the personal-product company's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Johnson, who has been president of the company since December, was named 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
George Johnson will stay on as a consultant. He also is chairman of the holding 
company that owns Independence Bank of Chicago and Drexel National Bank in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were approved Monday by Johnson Products' board. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin J. Boutte, chairman of Independence Bank of Chicago and a member of the 
Johnson Products board, declined to elaborate on the move. 
</P>
<P>
"This was strictly a family affair. They amicably agreed to do it this way," 
said Boutte. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not expect radical changes at the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric has really been running the company on a day-to-day basis," Boutte said. 
</P>
<P>
Other terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and Rinella said the divorce 
records were impounded and not available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
George Johnson's attorney, Robert Hirsch, did not return telephone calls to his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Neither George nor Joan Johnson could be reached through the company on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rinella said Johnson Products, which is completing an internal reorganization 
begun 18 months ago, would benefit from the management change. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she can turn it around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Founded in Chicago 
</P>
<P>
The divorce action had been pending for more than a year while the two sides 
discussed terms of the settlement, including the change in ownership of the 
company, Rinella said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether George Johnson had considered selling the company instead of 
turning it over, Rinella said it "could have been an option . . . but that 
never developed." 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons founded the company in Chicago, and it became the first 
black-owned company traded on the American Stock Exchange in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
While the company has lost money for the past eight years, it posted small 
gains in the past two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported a loss of $3.7 million on sales of $29.1 million in fiscal 
1988. The company registered a $2.2-million one-time gain in the first quarter 
of its 1989 fiscal year after selling land near its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson Products was 17th on this year's list of the nation's 100 largest 
black-owned companies, compiled by Black Enterprise magazine.

PACIFIC ENTERPRISES CEO TO STEP DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
PAUL A. MILLER'S RESIGNATION ENDS 103 YEARS OF FAMILY LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul A. Miller, who shepherded Pacific Enterprises through an aggressive 
diversification beyond its core Southern California Gas Co. utility, said 
Tuesday that he will retire as chairman and chief executive at the end of this 
month, ending a 41-year career and 103 years of family leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 64, whose grandfather co-founded the $7-billion company, will hand the 
reins Nov. 1 to President James R. Ukropina, 52, a former oil executive who 
joined the company five years ago and played a key role in Pacific Enterprises' 
move into specialty retailing and oil and gas production. 
</P>
<P>
Ukropina, who will be the first non-family member to run the company, will be 
succeeded in the presidency by Willis B. Wood Jr., 55, now an executive vice 
president. The changes were approved by the company's directors at a meeting in 
their Los Angeles headquarters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm leaving behind some real challenges to the succeeding management," 
Miller said later. "We've gone through a time of rapid acquisitions, which was 
by design, and we knew when we did it that it was giving us a bit of 
indigestion, but it's important to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Ukropina said, "My challenge will be to continue to hold the course we're on." 
</P>
<P>
The succession comes at a time when the company is poised to reap some of the 
benefits of its recent acquisitions and expansions, particularly with 
recovering oil and natural gas prices and increasing demand for gas, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entered New Fields 
</P>
<P>
"I think the team that Mr. Ukropina was a part of and that he helped form over 
the last couple of years is pretty well in place and pretty well prepared to 
take advantage of what may turn out to be a fairly bright environment for the 
utility, as well as for the other two businesses," said Joseph Culp, an analyst 
with First Manhattan Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The company's main business remains Southern California Gas Co., the nation's 
largest gas utility with 4.4 million customers, which accounts for more than 
half of the corporation's net income. 
</P>
<P>
But during Miller's administration, the company moved aggressively into 
non-utility businesses, focusing on specialty retailing and oil and gas 
production, with the goal of earning half of its net income from such 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller drew some criticism for the company's rapid expansion and that led 
to a bitter proxy fight in the spring. Moreover, the timing of some of the 
deals may have hurt the company's standing on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock plunged from a high of $60 a share in 1987 to a low of 
$35.625 this year. But rising oil and gas prices have helped the stock recover 
somewhat. On Tuesday, it closed at $51.125, up 87.5 cents a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second quarter, Pacific reported net income of $53 million, 
compared to $48 million a year ago. Operating revenue for the quarter was $1.5 
billion, compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The three units have had mixed results. The gas company reported improved 
operating income after taxes of $52 million in the second quarter, compared to 
$48 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retailing Unit Slips 
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas unit reported strong operating income after taxes of $20 
million for the quarter, compared to $10 million a year ago. But the retailing 
unit saw operating income after taxes fall to $11 million in the quarter, 
compared to $12 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986, Pacific Enterprises bought Thrifty Corp. for $886 million. And 
in May, 1988, the company bought Pay 'n' Save drugstores and Bi-Mart discount 
stores, which both operate mainly in the Pacific Northwest, for $232 million in 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, Pacific bought Sabine Corp., a Dallas-based oil and gas 
company, for $339 million and subsequently acquired mineral rights on the 
Burnett Ranch in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The company changed its name from Pacific Lighting Corp. in early 1988 to 
reflect its diversification. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who turns 65 on Oct. 30, joined the company in 1948 after graduating

CHECCHI WON'T ADD A PARTNER IN NWA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi said Tuesday that he will not take on a 
new equity partner to replace $225 million of the equity that KLM Royal Dutch 
Airlines contributed in June to help him buy NWA Inc., parent of Northwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi, who assumed the title of chairman and chief executive last week after 
the sudden resignation of Steven G. Rothmeier, also said in a telephone 
interview that he was not surprised that Rothmeier decided to leave. "It was 
different for him at Northwest as a private company, rather than a public 
company. I knew that he was exploring his options." 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department on Friday gave Checchi six months to reduce KLM's 
contribution to $175 million from $400 million. The department said it was 
concerned that KLM, as a foreign investor and the largest equity contributor, 
could exercise control over the airline even though it only held 5% of 
Northwest's common shares. 
</P>
<P>
The department has been increasingly concerned about foreign investment in U.S. 
airlines and said it is possible for a foreign investor to control a U.S. 
airline even if its ownership stake is small. Federal rules limit foreign 
ownership in U.S. airlines to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wouldn't Make Sense' 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said in the interview that he plans to repay KLM the $225 million, 
either from Northwest's cash flow, or from the proceeds of a new issue of 
nonvoting preferred stock. Another alternative, he said, is to sell a small 
ownership stake to Northwest's employees, but he added, "I don't know how 
significant a source of capital that would be." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he said, "I'm not entertaining the thought of taking on another 
partner. That wouldn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said the source of funds for the repayment would depend on financial 
market conditions at the time. He said he is confident that he can meet the 
Transportation Department's deadline and added that the department agreed to 
give him one six-month extension of the deadline, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said NWA has already reduced its takeover-related debt to $3.1 billion 
from $3.35 billion. He said the airline is exploring the possibility of 
developing its land in Tokyo with a Japanese partner and that such a venture 
"would free up a substantial amount of cash." 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said he is exploring a commercial development project with 15 to 20 
Japanese firms but declined to say what such a deal would be worth. Wall Street 
estimates for the value of Northwest's Japanese real estate have ranged from 
$250 million to $400 million.

NINTENDO PLANS TO OFFER STOCK TRADING IN HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fidelity Investments and video game maker Nintendo of America have announced 
plans to jointly develop an at-home electronic stock trading service using the 
popular video game system. 
</P>
<P>
The new service, expected to become available by mid-1990, is modeled after a 
home shopping and information service offered by Nintendo's parent company in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The service is based on the premise that the Nintendo game player, which packs 
the power of the earliest personal computers yet costs only about $80, can be 
used effectively as a home computer when it is attached to another powerful 
appliance: the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Although the stock trading service is the first one to use a video game player, 
it is hardly the first at-home shopping and information service. The at-home 
market has been tested, with often disastrous results, by a variety of 
publishing companies, most of which have abandoned it. The latest venture, 
Prodigy, was launched last year by a partnership of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
and International Business Machines, but acceptance has been slow and the 
operation is relying heavily on the deep financial resources of its backers. 
</P>
<P>
The Fidelty-Nintendo venture will give the estimated 20 million U.S. households 
with Nintendo game systems access to a wide range of Fidelity's on-line 
financial services, including personal portfolio management and stock and 
mutual funds trading. Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund operator in 
the United States, currently manages more than $100 billion for its mutual fund 
and brokerage customers.

JACK SMITH: FROGS WIN IN RIBETTING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Saturday my wife and I drove up to La Canada High School to watch a game 
between the Ribet Frogs and the Antelope Valley Christian Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Our granddaughter is a Frog. When her family moved out of the Marshall High 
School district she had to change schools, and she elected to go to Ribet, a 
small private prep school in La Canada Flintridge. Having been a member of 
Marshall's classy cheerleading team, she immediately joined Ribet's six-girl 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Our daughter-in-law Jacqueline had called us and asked us to go to the game. 
"Mr. Smith," she said in her beguiling way, "it's such a little school. They 
really need support." 
</P>
<P>
She said she had not chosen the school because the name was French. It was just 
a coincidence. I wondered how my wife would feel about cheering a team called 
the Frogs. Being of French descent, she had once slapped a schoolmate in 
elementary school for calling her a frog. 
</P>
<P>
We picked up our son in Linda Vista to take him to the game. Jacqueline and our 
granddaughter had gone on ahead. Our son said the game was to be played on a 
field in Oak Grove Park, a heavily wooded park below the Jet Propulsion Lab. 
"It's supposed to be north of La Canada High School," he said. 
</P>
<P>
We drove past the high school and turned into Oak Grove. We wandered over dirt 
roads that meandered through the oak trees, looking into this clearing and 
that. No football field. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any goal posts," I kept saying. Finally we asked a forest ranger. 
He gave my son some arm directions. They led to another dead end. Then we 
noticed that we had picked up a tail. Four cars were following us. They were 
looking for the field too. 
</P>
<P>
Finally we went back to the entrance to start over (the other cars still 
following). A small sign nailed to a tree said the game was across the street 
on a field north of the school. We missed the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
The field was only 80 yards long. There were no goal posts. The Frogs wore 
green jerseys, the Eagles white. There was a small grandstand across the field 
for the visitors. It held about 50 people. Ours held about 100. Our 
granddaughter's pep team was off to one side, running through their drills. 
They wore white sweat shirts and short white skirts. They chanted: 
</P>
<P>
 Frogs in the front, 
</P>
<P>
 Let me hear you grunt; 
</P>
<P>
 Frogs in the back, 
</P>
<P>
 Show us where it's at -- right here! 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles had a big back who seemed to be pummeling the Frogs. There were only 
eight players to a team, and six or seven reserves on each bench. I was afraid 
the Eagles were going to demolish the Frogs. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a Frog broke through and ran 30 yards for a touchdown. It was called 
back for clipping. Later, on defense, a Frog back intercepted a pass and ran it 
back 35 yards for a touchdown. There being no goal posts, they had to go for 
two points. The Eagles held: 6-0 Frogs. 
</P>
<P>
The girls ran through another drill: 
</P>
<P>
 GO! Let me hear you say GO! 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, UNITE! 
</P>
<P>
 Let me hear you say FIGHT! 
</P>
<P>
 WIN! Let me hear you say WIN! 
</P>
<P>
 Together, again! 
</P>
<P>
 Let me hear you say GO! FIGHT! WIN! 
</P>
<P>
 The Frogs had two very fast backs. Twice they broke away for long touchdowns. 
I couldn't tell whether they were inspired by the girls or not. Across the 
field four little girls in checkered miniskirts were cheering the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
There were no food stands. At halftime my wife and our daughter-in-law and I 
drove up Foothill Boulevard to a McDonald's and bought four hamburgers and four 
Cokes. We missed the kickoff again. 
</P>
<P>
The Frogs were too good for them. Late in the fourth quarter it was 34-0. Then 
the Eagles scored, and just as the Trojans were to do that same day up at 
Washington State, they passed for the two points and made it. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Frogs, 34, Eagles 8. 
</P>
<P>
Going back on Linda Vista we ran into the UCLA-UC crowd heading for the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't see anything about our game in the Sunday paper.

PROVOCATIVE CALL TO ARMS ON GAY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear &amp; Hatred of Gays in the 
'90s by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen (Doubleday: $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
One out of 10 Americans is gay, according to Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen in 
"After the Ball," and these 25 million men and women are "forced to cower and 
skulk like a German Jew of the '30s." They are the victims of "a national 
sickness" that manifests itself in the fear and hatred of homosexuality. The 
only appropriate response from the gay community -- and the only way to put an 
end to their oppression -- is "ice-cold, controlled, directed rage." 
</P>
<P>
But "After the Ball" is not a call to the barricades; rather, it is a curious 
call to the story boards and 30-second spots of Madison Avenue, a kind of 
sanitized upscale media radicalism that finds mass demonstrations to be 
"ghastly freak shows" and prefers highway billboards that "earnestly propound 
appealing truisms, the safer and more platitudinous, the better." As the 
authors readily admit: "We're talking about propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
"After the Ball" is a stubbornly revisionist critique of the conventional 
wisdom of gay activism over the last two decades ("The gay revolution has 
failed," the authors announce at the very outset); a study of the origins and 
workings of contemporary attitudes toward gay men and women; and, above all, "a 
practical agenda for bringing to a close, at long last, the seemingly permanent 
crisis of American homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
The book opens with a wide-ranging and penetrating survey of what the authors 
call "homochondria" and "homo-hatred," ranging from coarse back-room bigotry to 
the veiled slander of television advertising. But the essential message of the 
book is an urgent demand for a fundamental change in the very nature of gay 
activism. The gay community, Kirk and Madsen argue, has resorted to the wrong 
arguments, the wrong symbols, and the wrong acts of protest. And the authors of 
"After the Ball' think that they have a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We're assumed to consist entirely of extreme stereotypes: men ultra swishy and 
ultraviolet, Frankensteinian thug-women with bolts on their necks, mustachio'd 
Dolly Parton wanna-bes, leather-men in boots and whips, ombudsmen of pederasty 
squiring their ombudsboys -- all ridiculous, deranged, or criminal," the 
authors write. "And when we are finally allowed to rally and march, to lay our 
case before the cameras of the straight American public, what do we do? We call 
out of the woodwork as our ambassadors of bad will all the screamers, stompers, 
gender-benders, sadomasochists, and pederasts, and confirm America's worst 
fears and hates. You can call it gay liberation if you like: we say it's 
spinach, and we say the hell with it!" 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have devised a program of gay advocacy based on media-wise 
techniques of image manipulation: "A continuous flood of gay-related 
advertising" that will depict gays "in the least offensive fashion possible" 
while making "homo-hating beliefs and actions look so nasty that average 
Americans will want to dissociate themselves from them." This is pure 
propaganda, of course, but it is propaganda on the highest levels of insight 
and calculation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have in mind a strategy as calculated and powerful as that which gays are 
accused of pursuing by their enemies -- or, if you prefer, a plan as 
manipulative as that which our enemies themselves employ," Kirk and Madsen 
declare. "It's time to learn from Madison Avenue, to roll out the big guns." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Behavior 
</P>
<P>
To their credit, Kirk and Madsen do not make the mistake of piling all of their 
expectations on "image-management techniques." They also call for changes in 
what they frankly characterize as the "misbehavior" -- sexual and otherwise -- 
of the gay community. "Straights hate gays not just for what their myths and 
lies say we are, but also for what we really are," the authors write. "All the 
squeaky-clean media propaganda in the world won't sustain a positive image in 
the long unless we start scrubbing to make ourselves a little squeakier and 
cleaner in reality. And, as it happens, our noses (and other parts) are far 
from clean." 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Kirk or Madsen would disagree with my observation that "After the 
Ball" is an uncomfortable book -- their self-proclaimed mission is to shock and 
provoke their readers, whether gay or straight. But it's also true that their 
ideas are so lively and provocative, their language so rich and spirited, that 
I came to admire and enjoy "After the Ball" even in its moments of rhetorical 
excess. (And, if I may say so, the graphic design of the book, credited to 
Carol Malcolm, is as elegant, handsome and functional as any I've seen.)

BIGGEST RESTAURANT TIPS: NOW, THAT'S ITALIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Waiters in Italian restaurants in America get the biggest tips from customers 
while those in Mexican eateries fare the worst, the Internal Revenue Service 
has found. 
</P>
<P>
The average tip in Italian restaurants in 1986 was 15.8%, compared with 15% in 
Chinese restaurants and 14.8% in Mexican restaurants, according to an IRS 
study. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, patrons in Chinese restaurants were more likely to leave a 
tip -- 90 out of every 100 did -- than in Italian restaurants, where only 88 
saw fit to leave something. In restaurants serving Mexican food there were 86 
tips for every 100 customers. 
</P>
<P>
The study did not try to give any reason for the differences, nor did it ask 
about restaurants that serve the foods of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
At least one waiter at a small Italian restaurant in Georgetown, a popular 
Washington restaurant area, agreed that he got better tips there than in other 
places he had worked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the European atmosphere," explained Mouez Zemni, who comes not from Italy 
but from Tunisia, on the other side of the Mediterranean. "There's the European 
flair. People like the atmosphere and it relaxes them. It doesn't even matter 
about the food. I don't like Italian food much myself -- I think French food is 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
At a bigger, pricier Italian place, the maitre d' was not so sure about high 
tips. "Some people come in here with a couple of kids and leave a dollar," said 
Julio Estrada. "About 20%-25% don't leave anything." 
</P>
<P>
A waiter at a Mexican restaurant would not agree that his tips were inferior. 
"It's a matter of food and service," he insisted, a little stiffly. "If a 
customer gets good food and good service, he tips well." 
</P>
<P>
What started the IRS investigation is that waiters are required by law to 
include tips in their earnings and pay income tax on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Underreporting of tip income has long been a concern," Thomas A. Thompson, an 
IRS researcher, wrote in his report on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
So the service hired the Survey Research Laboratory of the University of 
Illinois to query its panel of nearly 13,000 households, both families and 
individuals. They kept records of their tips over two-week periods between 1983 
and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The diary approach used in this study was adopted on the ground that tipping 
information obtained from people leaving tips is likely to be more accurate 
than data obtained from tip recipients," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Before narrowing the survey down to ethnic restaurants, the study tried other 
classifications, with labels that included "family-type restaurants" and 
"atmosphere-specialty restaurants." That turned out to be too vague. 
</P>
<P>
People tipped more in restaurants that accepted credit cards and those that 
served alcohol. Patronage at what the report called "tip-type" restaurants 
declined between 1983 and 1986, but tipping stayed level.

LAWN CIRCUS NETS $100,000 FOR HOMELESS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday will mark a national march on Washington in support of America's 
homeless, but Los Angeles supported the event Sunday in true L.A. style. 
</P>
<P>
When the money was counted up, $100,000 was netted for Housing Now! (the group 
that is sponsoring the march). The place was Holmby Hills, on the grounds of 
Jean and Casey Kasem's new $6.5-million estate. The fund-raiser, an elaborate 
lawn circus. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Third World ambiance of parts of America, although not Holmby Hills, 
Jean Kasem said, "This is not America any more. This is Kuala Lampur. I mean, 
wake me up and tell me that I am not dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
She wasn't dreaming, even if the enormity of the lawn circus at times seemed 
like a cotton-candy hallucination. Five-thousand invitations had been sent out 
(the general public was not invited), and guests, dressed in everything from 
suits to shorts, clutched bags of popcorn and balloons as their children tried 
the dunk tank, bounced in a moon bounce and had their pictures taken with Yogi 
Bear and Dino. 
</P>
<P>
A guest or two expressed a slight spiritual queasiness about raising money for 
the homeless among such L.A. affluents. Although the Kasems' new home has only 
three bedrooms, it does have a few Beverly Hills-style amenities, such as a 
nine-hole golf course, a tennis court and a heart-shaped swimming pool with 
bare-breasted mosaic mermaids on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Silly Question 
</P>
<P>
Actress Valerie Harper, who helped the Kasems organize the event, would have 
none of this school of thought. "Someone just asked me about that," she told 
Jean Kasem, "and I said, 'What better way to use opulence.' It's such a silly 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Not so silly was the cash flowing into the Housing Now! coffers. Before the 
event, $50,000 worth of tickets were sold and another $30,000 was raised during 
the afternoon at the game and food booths (all vegetarian at the Kasems' 
insistence). There was also a midway set up over the mini golf course, with 
sword swallowers, fire eaters and a snake charmer wandering among the guests 
who were trying their hands at games of skill. All the game booths were 
sponsored and underwritten by television shows, enabling players to win "Alf" 
mugs and "Newhart" cast albums with all the proceeds going to the charity. The 
Kasems paid for the party. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm-and-blues standards boomed through the neighborhood, thanks to the 
fabulous Thunderbirds and a fabulous speaker system, which was playing for 
several hundred appreciative fans on the front lawn. Shuttle buses were kept 
busy all afternoon, ferrying guests from a parking lot at UCLA and back again. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who turned out to lend their names to the affair were David 
Hasselhoff, Rita Coolidge, Dennis Christopher, Mitchell Laurance, Dinah Manoff, 
John Ratzenberger, Katey Sagal, Beverly Sassoon, John Schneider, Joanne Carson, 
Joyce DeWitt and Kasem's replacement on the "American Top 40," announcer Shadoe 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the stage became an auction block for sculpture and oil paintings 
provided for the occasion by Victor Salmones Galleries and the Makk Galleries 
of Beverly Hills. The art auction raised more, which eventually put the 
afternoon's net profit at over the $100,000 mark.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NOT EVERY TV BULLETIN ON NORIEGA WAS A NEWS COUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrations have been building for months. So once again, it's time to unleash 
the fury of . . . The Gripe Line. First, a good news/bad news gripe. 
</P>
<P>
We Interrupt This Program. . . . But why? News bulletins are often arbitrary 
and unmerited, giving undue emphasis to relatively unimportant events. 
</P>
<P>
An example of good use came Tuesday morning, when ABC, CBS and NBC repeatedly 
interrupted their regular programming for accounts of a possible coup attempt 
in Panama, where strongman Manuel A. Noriega has been a scourge to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The early information was sketchy and conflicting. In its role as the nation's 
instant news source, CNN inevitably succumbed to the scattershot 
"another-report-we're-getting" syndrome. And there was this from KCBS reporter 
Harvey Levin: 
</P>
<P>
"As you've just heard, Panama strongman Manuel Noriega has fallen from power as 
the result of a coup." Levin announced it at a 10 a.m. newsbreak. He spoke 
those words, firmly and resolutely, moments after Harry Smith of CBS News had 
echoed ABC, NBC and CNN in reporting that there was not yet outside 
confirmation of Noriega being ousted. Perhaps Levin had independent sources in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletins became less frequent as the morning wore on. Confusing? Yes. Yet 
merely informing viewers that something of consequence was happening in 
strategically important Panama -- more definitive details to follow -- was 
ample reason for the bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
That was hardly the case last month when all three networks interrupted their 
prime-time programming for live reports on the USAir crash in New York City's 
East River that took two lives. Few details were available at the time. Yet the 
mere presence of these bulletins -- regardless of their content -- gave undue 
weight to the story by giving the erroneous impression that a disaster may have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that these hair-trigger bulletins from the networks were motivated 
by competitive pressure and by having accessibility to the crash site, which 
translated into pictures. 
</P>
<P>
But that did not translate into good judgment. 
</P>
<P>
The TV Witness Protection Program. What else would you call it when the 
identity of someone being interviewed is supposed to be hidden for his or her 
protection? But who is kidding whom? 
</P>
<P>
One method of concealment is electronic breakup -- a section of the picture 
turning into a sort of cubist blur -- that is designed to hide a person's face 
on newscasts. It works fine -- until the person moves suddenly, leaving the 
blur behind. Oops, there's the face. 
</P>
<P>
Another method is outright disguise, as on Monday's "Donahue" show featuring 
three women claiming to have been molested by clergymen. Their flimsy disguises 
-- wigs and sunglasses -- were a joke. What's more, they spoke in their normal 
voices, making them easily identifiable to anyone who knew them. 
</P>
<P>
A third method is positioning and lighting, a la the recent "CBS This Morning" 
interview with a 13-year-old girl whose mother had delivered her to a man to be 
raped as payment for drugs. After the rape, the mother and the man got high 
together. They're now in jail. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, CBS shot the girl in a sort of silhouette, with a shaft of the 
background light briefly hitting her face and allowing viewers to get a glimpse 
of both her eyes. At another point, she was shown from the rear. Meanwhile, 
she, too, spoke in her natural voice. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, her identity was shielded, but only from people who didn't know her in the 
first place. For all the others, it must have been an easy call. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders about the promises made to interviewees who desire their identities 
to remain secret, or possibly in the case of the young girl, promises made to 
the authorities charged with protecting the interests of a minor. And one 
wonders about the reactions of interviewees upon learning the promises haven't 
been kept. 
</P>
<P>
Although the case involving the teen-ager and her mother had already been 
widely publicized, the girl's identity had not been revealed. Victimized first 
by her mother and the rapist, she was now victimized again by a TV news program 
using her to fill a few minutes of air time. 
</P>
<P>
If the implications weren't so sobering, all of this would be almost comical. 
It recalls those old movie Westerns in which bank robbers shrewdly disguised 
themselves by raising their kerchiefs over their mouths and noses, as if this 
alone would hide their identities from those who knew them, even though they 
were wearing the clothes they always wore -- including those kerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the methods used to disguise TV interviewees are so inept that you 
wonder if they're deployed merely for effect, to inject suspense. What I'm 
waiting for is the interview where the only person wearing the disguise . . . 
is the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
The Bleep That Doesn't. We've all seen it happen, usually in theatrical movies 
aired on regular television. But what in the bleep is gained from erasing 
potentially offensive words from a sound track when the deleted words are so 
obvious that only an idiot couldn't fill in the blanks? 
</P>
<P>
Credits That Don't Credit. These are the after-show credits that roll by so 
fast that they can't be read. 
</P>
<P>
Political Pundits on Talk Shows. One day, someone will blow the whistle on 
these people by tallying how often they have been wrong. Aside from that, some 
people can't tolerate them on a gut level. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest book, "Harp," John Gregory Dunne describes his reaction to 
watching Patrick Buchanan, Robert Novak, Fred Barnes, Morton Kondracke and 
Michael Kinsley on CNN: 
</P>
<P>
"I detested those people I was staring at on the tube, the op-ed grandees who 
moonlight as talking heads, that symbiotic army of the knowing who would 
explain the political process to us, at least as they wish us to believe it 
functions." Then Dunne quits softballing and gets tough: 
</P>
<P>
"Plump is the word that fits them best. They are plump of body, plump of mind, 
the cholesterol of smarm and self-importance clogging every mental artery, 
bloated bladders of hot air (blowing) the most noxious kind of knowingness out 
through the cathode tube. They have nothing to tell me, these Kondrackoids of 
the process, they have nothing to tell any of us about the United States of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
But give them credit, they sure are arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
The Commercial You Can't Bear to Hear. The reason is the irritating voice on 
the commercial. It belongs to Robert M. Haft, president of Crown Books, who 
sounds like Mickey Mouse when he says: "If you paid full price, you didn't get 
it at Crown Books." 
</P>
<P>
The Commercial That Won't Die. You'd have to drive a stake through its heart to 
kill that long-running spot for Jack Stephan Plumbing &amp; Heating. The actor 
has been changed, but not the awful script. Playing around with the name -- 
"Stephanski" and so on -- wasn't funny 10 years ago, it isn't funny now and it 
won't be funny 10 years from now when, undoubtedly, this dopey commercial will 
still be running. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of like The Gripe Line.

NO SPANISH VERSION OF 'OLD GRINGO' FOR LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG BARRIOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Old Gringo," a romantic period film about an American writer and an American 
spinster who get caught up behind the lines of the Mexican Revolution, would 
seem to be a perfect mainstream studio picture to subtitle and turn loose in 
cities with large Latino populations. 
</P>
<P>
But Columbia Pictures, which scored big on subtitled prints of "La Bamba" two 
years ago, has apparently decided to release "Old Gringo" in the English 
version only -- at least for the initial run. 
</P>
<P>
The $24-million film, adapted from the Carlos Fuentes' novel "Gringo Viejo," 
opens Friday in more than 200 theaters nationally and some exhibitors with 
theaters in Latino communities think Columbia is missing a good opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"('Old Gringo') is similar to 'The Milagro Beanfield War,' but it also has 
romance and the action of the Revolution," said Joe Peixoto, head buyer for 
Metropolitan Films, which operates several theaters that cater to 
Spanish-speaking audiences. "We hope to book it for four screens and have 
requested subtitled prints. But Columbia hasn't given us an answer on their 
availability yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Old Gringo" opened throughout Mexico in early September with 55 
Spanish-subtitled prints, after earlier openings with subtitled prints in 
Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. The film is now playing in only a handful of 
theaters in Mexico, but despite the apparent availability of subtitled prints, 
the movie is opening here strictly in English. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's decision not to release subtitled prints for its initial release in 
the United States was apparently based on advice it got from marketing 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an upscale picture that will appeal to middle-class Latinos, people who 
are already in the mainstream," said Santiago Pozo, head of the Arenas Group 
marketing agency hired by Columbia. "It doesn't have blue-collar appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Peixoto disagrees. He said "Old Gringo" would "definitely" play well in his 
company's downtown L.A. theaters where he is still hoping to show subtitled 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward subtitled mainstream pictures in large Latino communities has 
been productive for the studios. Such films as "Batman," "Ghostbusters II," 
"Lethal Weapon 2," "Black Rain," "Pet Sematary," "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade," "Star Trek V," and "Major League" -- none of which had a Latin theme 
-- opened with Spanish-subtitled prints. 
</P>
<P>
(Another Latin-themed film, "Romero," with Raul Julia starring as El Salvador's 
martyred Archibishop Oscar Romero opened Sept. 8 in two Southland theaters only 
with English versions. It has since expanded locally to 16 theaters, four of 
which are showing the movie with Spanish subtitles, according to its 
distributor, Four Seasons Entertainment.) 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's limited release of "Old Gringo" in the United States, after its 
postponement from a scheduled Christmas release last year, has caused 
speculation that the studio may not have faith in the film's box-office 
potential -- hence, a wait-and-see attitude regarding the distribution of 
subtitled prints. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Bonfiglio, Fonda's partner and co-producer, conceded that monolingual 
Spanish-speaking moviegoers may not get to see "Gringo" with subtitles unless 
early box-office returns warrant a wider release. But she defended the 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"Columbia is telling us that Hispanic theater audiences generally prefer 
English during the first run of the movie," she said. "And even in those cases 
where they may only be Mexican-speaking (sic), they use it as a vehicle to 
learn English. We're conforming to the way theaters function. After all, these 
(exhibitors) know what their audience wants to see." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, has Columbia been promoting the film in English and Spanish 
advertising? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, most studios advertise their English language product in the 
Hispanic media," Pozo said. "Latinos will go see the latest films in English 
because they want entertainment just like anyone else. All we have to do is 
make them aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
Placing a few subtitled prints to capitalize on a bilingual media blitz can be 
risky, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Spanish prints are a double-edged sword," Pozo said. "If we use Spanish prints 
and they don't make at least the average or double" of first-run per-screen 
box-office receipts, "that will be the studios' excuse to say, 'The market is 
not there. Hispanics are not interested in films.' " 
</P>
<P>
Spokespeople for several Latino organizations have expressed disappointment 
with Columbia's marketing approach, while others seem unsurprised or 
unconcerned. A number of benefit screenings of the film are planned by 
nonprofit Latino groups, with Columbia's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The issue reportedly surfaced when Fonda appeared during a recent taping of 
"Cara a Cara (Face to Face)," a public affairs program that airs Friday on the 
national Spanish-language TV network Telemundo (locally, KVET-TV, Channel 52). 
</P>
<P>
Armando Duron, chairman of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, also 
addressed the issue in a prepared statement that questioned Columbia's alleged 
"tampering" with director Luis Puenzo's script, and with the studio's final cut 
of the movie, which excised much of the original footage and a crucial Latin 
point of view, according to complaints by Puenzo at a Buenos Aires film seminar 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
"What is Columbia afraid of by not releasing this film in our native language 
to our community, which is faced daily with questions about the relationship 
between the U.S. and Mexico?," Duron asked. "How can a real dialogue occur if 
many in our community can't partake in any dialogue until weeks after this film 
is released?"

KOST-FM RIDES THE SOFT WAVE TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Easy-listening "soft hits" have supplanted teen dance music as Los Angeles' 
most popular radio format, with KPWR-FM "Power 106" losing its two-year 
stranglehold on the No. 1 position to KOST-FM (103), the Arbitron ratings 
showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
KPWR (105.5) dropped from No. 1 to No. 3 and KOST moved up from No. 2 to No. 1 
in the ratings survey, which covered the 12-week period from June 22 to Sept. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic," KOST program director Jhani Kaye said Tuesday. "This has been 
a dream come true for everyone on the staff for a long time. We did it the hard 
way -- without teens." 
</P>
<P>
KOST's audience is primarily in the 25-54 age group, Kaye said. He attributed 
the station's success to consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the (on-air personalities) you hear on KOST-103 have been on the radio 
station since 1982 and the audience has gotten to know 'em and love 'em because 
they're nice people and it comes across on the air," Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
KOST garnered 6.8% of the listening audience during the ratings period, up from 
6.1% during the preceeding quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Following KOST was KIIS-FM (102.7) with a 6.4 share of the audience. The 
station, known for its Top 40 playlist and big-money giveaways, had dropped in 
the last ratings period from its consistent No. 1 and No. 2 positions over the 
past few years to No. 4, with a 4.9 share. KIIS' morning-drive show, with Rick 
Dees, emerged as the top-rated morning program in the latest survey, replacing 
KPWR's Jay Thomas, who dropped dramatically from first to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically I think that the last (ratings) book was a fluke and we had a wobble 
and we're back to where we're supposed to be," said KIIS promotions director 
Karen Tobin. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing second behind Dees in the competitive morning ratings were the 
KLOS-FM (95.5) comedy duo of Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps. Overall, KLOS came 
in at No. 7 in the ratings, inching up from No. 8 in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
KQLZ-FM (100.3) "Pirate Radio," which debuted only last March and quickly made 
its way into the top 10, climbed from No. 5 to No. 4 in the ratings, followed 
by easy-listening station KJOI-FM (98.7). 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in several years, Los Angeles' top five radio stations were 
all music stations. Perennial talk-radio favorite KABC-AM (790) fell from No. 2 
in the previous quarter to No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more significant ratings jumps this quarter was one by oldies 
station KODJ-FM (93.1), a relative newcomer that debuted earlier this year. It 
jumped from No. 19 to No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings, which are based on information recorded by listeners in a personal 
diary over a seven-day period, do not take into account the most recent changes 
in local radio programming that occurred in mid-September. On Sept. 20, 
58-year-old classical station KFAC-FM (92.3) was replaced by the urban rock 
format of KKBT-FM. Two days earlier, KKGO-FM (105.1) began adding classical 
music to what had been an all-jazz format. Here are the area's top 10 stations, 
followed by their ratings for the most recent summer quarter and the preceding 
spring quarter, as measured by Arbitron. One share point is said by Arbitron to 
represent about 10,000 listeners per average quarter-hour.

EURYTHMEUM STUTTGART: VOCABULARY OF DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a stage awash with performers shrouded in yards of colorful, diaphanous 
fabric. They move in stately, fluid patterns under ever-changing colored lights 
to live music or to the rise and fall of the spoken voice. The spectacle 
combines something of the sensuousness of a '60s light show with the 
spiritualistic aura of early 20th-Century modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
This is eurythmy, a form of movement envisioned by its creator, Rudolph 
Steiner, as "a continuation of divine movement" in which speech and music are 
"made visible." 
</P>
<P>
Last seen in Los Angeles in 1981, Eurythmeum Stuttgart -- the West German 
company Steiner founded in 1924 -- is at the Wadsworth Theatre tonight on the 
first stop of a three-city U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Else Klink, 82, is the troupe's artistic director and choreographer. Born in 
New Guinea to a Polynesian mother, Klink was 7 when her German father deposited 
her in the Waldorf School that Steiner founded in Stuttgart (the first of what 
was to become a worldwide network of private schools dedicated to his 
teachings). 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years earlier, the Austrian-born philosopher had developed eurythmy 
-- with actress Marie von Sivers -- and founded the Anthroposophical Society, a 
group dedicated to the belief that the human intellect can make contact with 
the spiritual world. 
</P>
<P>
"Children loved Steiner," Klink said last week from a small town in southern 
Australia where the company was on tour. "If he (observed) classes, we felt 
free, with no pressure. He was not like a guru!" 
</P>
<P>
Although a foot injury a few years later put an end to her hopes of becoming a 
ballet dancer, Klink was an eager student of eurythmy, part of the Waldorf 
School curriculum. She eventually joined the stage troupe at the Goetheanum in 
Dornach, Switzerland, the "school of spiritual science" Steiner founded in 
1913, and became co-director of Eurythmeum Stuttgart in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Among the works that the 16-member touring section of the troupe will interpret 
locally are an excerpt from Klink's "Peer Gynt" (based on Henrik Ibsen's 
verse-drama, with incidental music by Edvard Grieg), Shostakovich's Cello 
Sonata in D minor, one of Brahms' Hungarian dances and such musical desserts as 
Debussy's "Golliwog's Cakewalk." 
</P>
<P>
Klink explained that eurythmy comes from Greek words meaning beauty and 
harmony. Further clarifications tended to bog down in jargon and linguistic 
confusion. Hampered by speaking in English, a language not her own, Klink 
tossed out phrases like "the soul spreads out in movement" and "dance becomes 
an impulse from soul-wisdom" -- and balked at decoding them. 
</P>
<P>
Eurythmists dance as the spirit moves them -- the spirit as interpreted by 
Steiner's dogma, that is. Believing that every sound in speech is actually an 
invisible gesture, Steiner proposed that aspects of sound -- including pitch, 
rhythm and dynamics -- could be interpreted by specific movements or areas of 
the body. The sound "oh," for example, requires the arms to embrace space; the 
collarbone is the unlikely spot at which a performer supposedly experiences a 
tonic chord. 
</P>
<P>
At times, however, performers break away from interpreting the separate sounds 
of the text or music to reveal what eurythmists call its "mood of the soul" -- 
such states of mind as grief, merriment or reverence. 
</P>
<P>
"If you speak and move," Klink said in her slow, measured voice, "in these 
movements (are embodied) thought, feeling and will." Depending on its emphasis 
and rhythm, a gesture moving outward from the body may convey sympathetic 
feelings or willfulness; inward-turning gestures may reflect the state of 
thought or the feeling of distaste. 
</P>
<P>
Performers walk or run on half-toe, using their arms and hands to interpret the 
specific sound qualities. The gossamer, airborne cloaks the eurythmists wear 
help focus the audience's attention on flowing gestures rather than the 
specific body that creates them. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the vocabulary of gesture, eurythmy also involves constantly 
changing lighting patterns that portray, Klink says, "the color of the mood of 
soul," as reflected in the particular passage of text or music. A red light 
denotes anger; sadness is conveyed with green and blue. 
</P>
<P>
Absorbing the complex rules of eurythmy involves a four-year basic training, 
with three to five years more study for those who want to pursue stage careers. 
(Others choose to teach or to become movement therapists for the mentally ill.) 
But the payoff is that a performer can continue almost indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an art form which stretches the body to its utmost extent," said 
Klink -- who still performs short pieces on occasion. "It mobilizes very 
different forces in you."

EX-PRIEST A CELEBRITY AFTER DOING HEFNER VOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the summer, Charles D. Ara began receiving telephone calls from 
strangers and friends he had not heard from in years. 
</P>
<P>
Ara, who performed the marriage ceremony for Hugh Hefner, founder of the 
Playboy empire, was suddenly a very popular person. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the calls were from former Roman Catholic priests who, as is Ara, are 
married and are no longer considered to be priests by the Catholic church. 
"Some of them said they wished they had been chosen to perform the wedding," 
Ara said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Priests Offer Help 
</P>
<P>
Others were from priests who jokingly asked if they could participate in the 
July 1 marriage of Hefner to Kimberly Faye Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
"Some asked me if they could hold the Bible during the ceremony," said Ara, a 
counselor specializing in marriage, family and children in private practice in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie was always known as a maverick who is very committed to his beliefs," 
said a priest in the Los Angeles Archdiocese who did not want his name used. He 
said a number of priests who discussed Ara's role in the Hefner marriage said 
it would be bizarre for them as Catholic priests to perform the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
But another priest, Father Terrence Richey, said: "I couldn't imagine doing the 
wedding, but I'm not horrified that Charlie did it." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of television talk show host Pat Sajak called and invited Ara 
to appear on the Sajak program. 
</P>
<P>
Ara did not hesitate. He accepted. In fact, he appeared on the show on two 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The talkative and humorous Ara showed no signs of nervousness on television. At 
one point during the first appearance, July 7, Sajak joked that he could not 
shut up Ara long enough to get a word in himself. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said during the show that his marriage was similar in some ways to Hefner's 
marriage to Conrad, who is Playboy's reigning Playmate of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Is Younger, Taller 
</P>
<P>
Just as Hefner, 63, is older than his wife, who is 26, Ara, 59, pointed out 
that he is older than his wife Shirley, 47. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is much taller than I, and Kimberly appears to be an inch or two 
taller than Hef," Ara said. 
</P>
<P>
Ara says he is 5 feet, 5 inches but his 5-foot, 8-inch wife quipped, "He might 
be stretching it a bit." 
</P>
<P>
They were married in 1970 and live in Cerritos. They have five children, from 9 
to 16 in age. They met when Ara was a priest at St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic 
Church in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love, got married and gave up my chance to be Pope," said Ara, who 
was born in Los Angeles and attended St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Ara was invited to make a second appearance on the Sajak show, he said, after 
the show received a few calls from viewers who wanted to know how he could be 
married and still refer to himself as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rivera, public affairs director for the archdiocese, said the church had 
no comment on Ara's performing the ceremony for Hefner. 
</P>
<P>
Ara "is ancient history (as a former priest). As far as we are concerned, he is 
just another lay person," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Still Helping' 
</P>
<P>
But Ara said he still performs the duties of a priest. He regards himself as 
still ordained and consequently empowered by the state to perform weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"I added matrimony to my priesthood. I'm still helping people. I help them get 
over their hurt," said Ara, who is active in CORPUS (Corps of Reserve Priests 
United for Service). It is a national organization that lobbies the church for 
changes to allow married priests to serve again. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said that when he got a call from the bride-to-be asking him to preside 
over the wedding, "you could have knocked me over with a feather." 
</P>
<P>
"They had seen me perform another wedding in Malibu. They thought I was funny 
and did a good job," said Ara, who prides himself on being able to pitch 
humorous but thought-provoking one liners. 
</P>
<P>
Even in his practice as a therapist, Ara said, he tries to inject humor to help 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
During a therapy session, he said, he sometimes switches on a flashlight and 
tells the person: "Lighten up." 
</P>
<P>
He might tell a person who has been fired: "Losing your job might be the 
greatest thing for your wealth. Now, you can decide what you really will enjoy 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he advised the Hefners: "The grass isn't greener on the other side. 
The grass is greener where it is watered," or, in other words, that people 
"need to take care of their love." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Idea for Book 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he is planning to write a book based on a philosophy that also is the 
cornerstone of a workshop he is scheduled to teach Friday at Cerritos College 
titled "The 'A's' of Successful Marriages." The three-hour workshop, which 
costs $20, will begin at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that successful relationships depend on several "A" words, 
including having affection, giving attention to each other, acceptance of 
faults and appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Ara said he had fun mingling with the guests at Hefner's Holmby Hills estate 
during the wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
The Hefners must have enjoyed his performance, Ara said. 
</P>
<P>
"They invited me and my wife and all of the kids for hamburgers at their home. 
The butler cooked hamburgers for everyone, including Hef."

JUSTICES URGED TO STAY DEATH SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An openly skeptical state Supreme Court was urged Tuesday to overturn the 
conviction and death sentence of a man who, under the influence of drugs, 
killed a West Covina policeman with the officer's own shotgun in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Michael Anthony Jackson, now 34, told the court that the jury 
should have been instructed to consider the possibility that Jackson acted in 
self-defense -- although witnesses said the victim, Officer Kenneth Scott 
Wrede, had not even drawn his service revolver until after Jackson had wrenched 
a shotgun from Wrede's patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
Several justices reacted with unusually open disdain for that claim, as well as 
other contentions made by lawyer Gerald H. Gottlieb during arguments in the 
case in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cost Him His Life' 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," Justice Edward A. Panelli said at one point in the hearing. 
"If the officer had unholstered his revolver earlier, we probably wouldn't be 
here today. . . . He showed fantastic restraint -- and it cost him his life." 
</P>
<P>
The court also showed little patience with Gottlieb's surprising contention 
that Jackson's sentence should be overturned on grounds the framers of the 
federal Constitution had not intended to permit capital punishment. That theory 
has been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court for more than a century, most 
recently in a 1976 ruling upholding the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't waste time on that issue, counsel," advised Justice David N. 
Eagleson. Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas added a wry reminder that the state 
court is legally bound by federal high court rulings on federal constitutional 
questions. "You are asking us to reverse U.S. Supreme Court cases, are you 
not?" Lucas asked. "Isn't that a little heroic?" 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. David F. Glassman argued that there were no significant 
procedural errors in Jackson's trial and that his conviction and death sentence 
should be upheld. Officer Wrede had displayed uncommon patience in dealing with 
the suspect in his drug-induced state, Glassman said, "but he was met with such 
violence that he lost his life." 
</P>
<P>
There was "no possible analysis" of the evidence that would support a claim 
that Jackson was reasonably, or even unreasonably, acting in self-defense, the 
state prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Wrede was on routine patrol by himself shortly after noon on Aug. 31, 1983, 
when he received a radio call to investigate a man acting strangely at a nearby 
intersection. The officer encountered Jackson, walking down a street barefoot 
and appearing disoriented. According to authorities, Jackson reacted violently 
when Wrede sought to question him, at one point grabbing an eight-foot garden 
stake and brandishing it at the 26-year-old officer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called for Help 
</P>
<P>
After a struggle, Wrede ran to the patrol car to call for assistance. Witnesses 
said Jackson also went to the car and took the officer's 12-gauge shotgun from 
its holder. Wrede then unholstered his service revolver and crouched on the 
other side of the car. Jackson momentarily rested the shotgun on the roof, but 
then fired the weapon, striking Wrede in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, more police arrived but were cursed and threatened with the gun 
by Jackson before he finally was brought to the ground by a police dog, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was charged with first-degree murder and prosecutors sought the death 
penalty, as permitted by law in the killing of a police officer performing his 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admitted PCP Use 
</P>
<P>
At trial, Jackson, previously convicted of burglary and drug-related offenses, 
testified that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug PCP on the morning of the 
incident and could not remember shooting Wrede or the events leading up to the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
His trial counsel argued that Jackson, in his state of intoxication, was not 
aware of his actions. Because he thus could not have intended the officer's 
death, he should be convicted of no more than involuntary manslaughter, the 
lawyer contended. Nonetheless, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury found Jackson 
guilty of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Intent to Kill' 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb, appointed by the high court in 1984 to represent Jackson on appeal, 
argued Tuesday that Jackson had fired into the flashing light bar of the patrol 
car and that the fatal wound to Wrede came from a ricocheting pellet. This was 
an indication, the lawyer said, that "there was no intent to kill -- no intent 
to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
There was a "high probability" that the officer's death was accidental, 
Gottlieb said. Jackson, he said, could well have been responding to a perceived 
threat to his own life, and he should not have been convicted of murder. "The 
pattern here is not one of action (by Jackson) but one of response," the 
attorney said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE 'STING' FIGURE FOUND IN MISSING CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Hawthorne police sergeant who drew nationwide attention with a 
televised "sting" operation conducted to expose alleged police racism was found 
unconscious in a car that former football star Jim Brown had reported stolen, 
Los Angeles police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Don Jackson was discovered late Monday in a 1985 Pontiac Fiero parked next to a 
Los Angeles International Airport terminal, said Police Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was not arrested, but police were trying to determine whether a crime 
had been committed. Booth said the stolen-car report "appears to be the fruits 
of a family dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he had "nothing to do" with the car being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that on Tuesday he went to the airport to pick up Brown's 
daughter, Brandy Love, whom he said was a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I became extremely ill and nauseated and passed out as I got out of the car," 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated at Daniel Freeman Marina Mercy Hospital for an inflammation of 
the stomach and released, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson gained national attention last January when an NBC television news crew 
surreptitiously photographed a white Long Beach policeman as he appeared to 
slam Jackson's head through a shop window.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLEE DOUBTED AS KIDNAP SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 48-year-old parolee who was arrested Sunday in the kidnaping of a 6-year-old 
Santa Ana girl has been virtually ruled out as the suspect in a series of eight 
attempted child kidnapings in Los Angeles County, according to police in three 
of the four cities involved. 
</P>
<P>
While Hawthorne police have not made a final determination, authorities in 
Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Pico Rivera said child witnesses reviewed 
photographs of the suspect, Eduardo Uzcanga, and none identified him as the man 
who tried to lure them into his blue pickup by telling them their parents had 
been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"By looking at the photographs, it was a very strong negative," said Redondo 
Beach Lt. John Nelson. "We're not going to just close the book on this guy, but 
we're going to have to speed up in some other areas to try to find the right 
person." 
</P>
<P>
All the Los Angeles County kidnaping attempts, which occurred between Sept. 13 
and Sept. 28, involved a dark-haired man with a mustache who drove up to 
children in a blue vehicle, often described as a foreign-made, compact blue 
pickup with a white camper shell. 
</P>
<P>
Uzcanga also drove a blue pickup with a white camper shell, but that vehicle is 
a full-sized Chevrolet. Also, Uzcanga is considerably older than the Los 
Angeles Couny suspect, who is described as being in his 30s.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HARVARD, WESTLAKE SCHOOLS TO MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvard School for boys, widely considered among the most prestigious private 
schools in Los Angeles, has decided to give up an 89-year tradition and merge 
with Westlake School for girls, a private institution in Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The 800-student Harvard School, in North Hollywood, is a one-time military 
academy that is affiliated with the Los Angeles diocese of the Episcopal 
Church. Both Harvard and the 680-student Westlake School send virtually all 
graduates to four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1904, Westlake -- like Harvard -- is known for emphasizing community 
service among its students. 
</P>
<P>
The boards of trustees of the two schools agreed on the merger Monday and 
announced it to the schools' faculties, students and parents Tuesday. The 
merged institution will be known as Harvard-Westlake School and will operate on 
both campuses, with grades seven through nine at the Westlake campus and the 
upper grades at the Harvard campus. The merger will not be complete until the 
fall of 1991.

ASSAULT SUSPECT CHOSE WRONG WOMEN TO PICK ON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every morning, Patty Rodriguez jogs before going to work at the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department, where she investigates sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, she fell victim to one. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Rodriguez, 37, said she and her running partner, Deputy Kim Thompson, 
32, were jogging on Mednick Avenue in East Los Angeles about 7:30 a.m. when a 
22-year-old man grabbed her buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez tried to detain the man but let go when he tried to hit her with a 
rock, she said in an interview. The man escaped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Spot Suspect 
</P>
<P>
The two women continued their run, hoping to see the assailant again, Rodriguez 
said. Just before completing the course, the women saw him on Atlantic 
Boulevard.

"I just wanted to get him," Rodriguez said. "I am so sick and tired of women 
not being able to (be safe on) the streets." 
</P>
<P>
As Thompson, the better runner, chased the assailant, Rodriguez went to a house 
and called 911. After a 10- to 15-minute chase over more than a mile, Thompson 
caught the suspect at Woods Avenue and the Pomona Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez caught up with her just as uniformed deputies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"When he saw the deputy behind me, he wasn't going to go without a fight," 
Rodriguez said. The suspect struggled about three minutes before he was 
subdued, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Put His Hands Up' 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he just tired out and put his hands up," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Aurliano Diaz of East Los Angeles was arrested on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon and sexual battery and was being held on $2,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The incident did not stop the women from completing their run. Instead of 
riding back with deputies, they jogged half a mile to the East Los Angeles 
Sheriff's Station. Rodriguez is based there; Thompson works on gang problems 
out of the Firestone station. 
</P>
<P>
The women normally run three or four miles a day. "I got about a seven-mile run 
in today," Thompson said. "I was exhausted."

SUSPECTED 'MR. MAGOO BANDIT,' PARTNER HELD IN 23 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police have arrested a transient -- nicknamed the "Mr. Magoo bandit" for his 
thick prescription glasses -- who allegedly robbed 23 banks in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties over the past seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Michael Graham, 33, was taken into custody in Long Beach, just minutes 
after he allegedly robbed the Great Western Savings office at 5200 East 2nd 
St., Torrance police spokesman Ron Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested along with Graham was his suspected getaway driver, Kraig Fujinaka, 
30, of Long Beach, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were held without bail at the Torrance jail. They are expected to be 
arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police made the arrest and took a special interest in the case because 
seven of the robberies were committed in their city, more than in any other 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Fujinaka are believed also to have hit banks and savings and loans 
in Lakewood, San Pedro, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Rolling Hills Estates, 
Anaheim, Hawthorne, San Luis Obispo, Westlake Village, Garden Grove and Culver 
City, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies usually netted between $2,500 and $6,000, one Torrance police 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Tipped Off 
</P>
<P>
Torrance detectives said they began to close in on Graham recently, when they 
were tipped off that he was working with Fujinaka. 
</P>
<P>
About a week ago, detectives began a regular sunrise-to-sunset surveillance 
outside Fujinaka's home on Rose Avenue in Long Beach, Torrance Police Lt. Dave 
Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
They had not seen anyone matching the "Mr. Magoo" description -- a thin white 
man in his early 30s with brown hair, acne scars and thick glasses, with a 
resemblance to the popular cartoon character -- until Graham walked out of the 
home with Fujinaka on Tuesday morning, Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just said 'Holy Cow!' " Marsden said. "That was a very pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Traber said Fujinaka and Graham left the apartment at 8 a.m., and rented a 
late-model car in Long Beach. They drove around for more than two hours, 
stopping once outside a bank in Torrance before returning to Long Beach and 
robbing the Great Western Savings, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance detectives said they pulled over the rented car a mile away and 
arrested the two men without incident. 
</P>
<P>
The string of 23 alleged robberies does not approach the record for the Los 
Angeles area, FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said. Edward C. Dodson was accused of 
robbing 64 banks over six months in 1983 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities said that the Mr. Magoo bandit was remarkable for his feverish 
pace. Graham stands accused of robbing four banks in one hour on March 30 and 
three banks in just 50 minutes the following day.

CYNTHIA GARVEY FREED AFTER 1 DAY PENDING CONTEMPT CASE HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Cynthia Garvey, the ex-wife of baseball star Steve Garvey, was released from 
Sybil Brand Institute on Tuesday on the order of a state appellate court, a day 
after she had been jailed for violating a child visitation order. 
</P>
<P>
The four-judge 2nd District Court of Appeal determined that Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild had erred in denying Garvey bail, 
pending a review of a sentence imposed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"We find (Garvey) should be released on her own recognizance," the justices 
ruled. "Nothing in this order is to be construed as to our ultimate decision on 
the merits of the petition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaves With Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after Tuesday's ruling, a sobbing Garvey left the jail in 
Monterey Park, flanked by three female sheriff's deputies. She did not speak 
with reporters before climbing into her attorney's car about 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild found Garvey guilty of 43 charges of contempt for violating a 1988 
visitation order and immediately ordered her to jail, pending a Nov. 3 hearing 
on a 126-day court-ordered sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that she had "willfully" disobeyed an order requiring that 
daughters Whitney, 13, and Krisha, 14, spend Tuesday afternoons and every other 
weekend with their father and that he be allowed to speak to them on the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
According to wire service reports, Garvey was reunited with his daughters on 
Tuesday morning. The children had refused to go with him when he tried to gain 
custody on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The former first baseman for the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres, who is in

7 BOMBS DETONATED AT APARTMENTS NEAR CAL STATE FULLERTON CAMPUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the University Village apartment complex in Fullerton were 
awakened at 4 a.m. today when seven homemade bombs blew up behind the complex, 
which is near Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
A Fullerton police spokesman said no one was hurt in the blasts. Residents, 
primarily students, called the police to the Oxford Avenue complex. When 
officers arrived, they also heard explosions. They discovered nine bombs, seven 
of which had been detonated. The devices had been made from plastic beverage 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's bomb squad was able to defuse two of the bombs, 
which were filled with a gas that couldn't immediately be identified. Police 
were seeking suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit apparently did not want anyone or anything to be hurt by the 
blasts, officers said, because the bombs were placed far enough away from the 
apartments to avoid injury or property damage.

GATES CHARGES BORDER LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE FOR HEAVY FLOW OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A southern border leaking like a sieve allowed a record 20 tons of cocaine into 
Southern California and also threatens national security, Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates told the City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, discussing the Police Department's role in last week's record seizure of 
cocaine, said the nation's borders must be secured before such shipments can be 
halted. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have been to the border and seen what has been going on there it is a 
disgrace, a national disgrace," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and Councilman Hal Bernson urged the use of the armed forces to seal the 
border and cut off the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been my belief for a long time that the armed forces have to be 
involved," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief also reviewed how the Police Department came to be involved in the 
case in which 20 tons of cocaine and $12.4 million in cash were confiscated 
from a Sylmar warehouse late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Police worked with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and members of a 
narcotics task force representing several smaller Southern California cities in 
tracking the shipments to the warehouse, Gates said.

Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told a joint meeting of Congress 
today that his nation intends "to eradicate drug trafficking at its very 
roots." 
</P>
<P>
But Salinas, who is on a state visit to the United States, warned that "at the 
world level, we are losing." He said that is unacceptable and called for 
greater cooperation between governments to turn the tide. 
</P>
<P>
While vowing an all-out effort to curb drug trafficking, Salinas firmly ruled 
out joint U.S.-Mexican military operations to fight the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility for the fight in our country is exclusively ours," he said. 
"There will be no joint military operations on our soil." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, who met on Tuesday with President Bush, said there is now greater 
acceptance in the United States regarding the importance of greater efforts to 
reduce the demand for drugs.

HOUSE ACTS ON PROTESTS BY ELDERLY, VOTES REPEAL OF CATASTROPHIC HEALTH 
INSURANCE 
</P>

<P>
The House, responding to a firestorm of protest from elderly Americans against 
having to pay for expanded Medicare benefits, voted 360 to 66 today to repeal 
the catastrophic health insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
It then turned to consideration of a proposal to salvage a small piece of the 
year-old Medicare expansion. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee's health subcommittee, said the outright repeal is likely to stand. 
</P>
<P>
Stark was one of the main authors of the catastrophic program, signed into law 
last summer with great fanfare by then-President Ronald Reagan and hailed as 
the most significant expansion of Medicare in its two decades of existence. 
</P>
<P>
Today's vote to repeal it was a startling reversal of last year's 328-72 vote 
to pass the original measure. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the repeal vote, however, the final judgment on catastrophic health 
insurance is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
The action shifts to the Senate, where repeal sentiment is also strong but 
where Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) is looking for ways to 
save the framework of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the final decision was the fact that both the House and Senate 
wove the catastrophic health issue in with a massive deficit-reduction bill 
containing a number of other controversial topics -- including a capital gains 
tax reduction, child care and taxes on ozone-depleting chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the massive compromise measure will return as one big package to 
both chambers for a single up or down vote. 
</P>
<P>
The feature in last year's legislation that prompted the cries for repeal 
stemmed from a bipartisan agreement that the cost of the expanded benefits must 
be borne fully by the 33 million elderly and disabled people covered by 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Congress structured the increased fees so those in higher income brackets would 
pay a larger share in proportion to their tax liability -- up to a maximum of 
$800 this year. 
</P>
<P>
But that financing feature generated a firestorm of protest and overshadowed 
the big expansion in benefits for hospitalization, doctor bills and other 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The cry for repeal came mainly from three quarters: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Retirees who complained that their former employers were already giving 
them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Upper-income retirees who objected to having to pay a disproportionate 
share of the costs to make up for the modest $4-a-month assessment on the 
estimated 56% of Medicare beneficiaries who do not have enough money to owe any 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those who complained that the program did not address the main need of 
elderly Americans: insurance for nursing homes and other long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
With repeal or a massive rollback a virtual certainty, congressional health 
policy leaders said they anticipate even greater difficulty in the future in 
winning support for expanded health programs for the elderly.

BAKER TELLS U.S. OPTIONS ON PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
DISMISSES 'ARMCHAIR' CRITICS OF FAILURE TO ASSIST COUP

Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today the United States reserves the 
right to use military force against Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio 
Noriega, and dismissed "armchair generals" who faulted the Administration for 
not aiding Tuesday's failed coup. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration had known since 
the weekend about the coup plans but the rebels never asked for U.S. assistance 
and "we did not promise any involvement in the coup." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, said: "The United States 
retains the option to use American forces. That option has never been ruled 
out. But if you're going to risk American lives, it's the President's view that 
you do so on your own timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"You do so based on your own plans. At a time of maximum opportunity and 
advantage. You don't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and in response 
to rapidly changing circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, one official said various military options were discussed 
Tuesday with the President as the coup unfolded. Another official said: "When 
it appeared as though Noriega might have been dethroned . . . there were 
several options considered, none of which was going in and getting him." 
</P>
<P>
A number of members of Congress criticized the Bush Administration for failing 
to support the coup leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to be an armchair general," Baker said, without informing the 
committee members whether the rebels had at least tacit assurances of U.S. 
support, as some reports have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Bush acted immediately to do two things -- to safeguard American 
lives and to assure the security of the Panama Canal, just as the United States 
is obligated to do under the Panama Canal treaties. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Baker refused to say whether the U.S. military had offered 
any assurances of support to the insurgents.

<P>
Up to 12,000 more East Germans began leaving this city for West Germany today 
and were applauded by about 1,000 Czechoslovaks who gathered to watch them 
depart. 
</P>
<P>
The first of 10 special East German trains left here after a delay of nearly 24 
hours, caused by more people crowding stations in East Germany in the hope of 
hitching a ride to the West. 
</P>
<P>
As the East Germans boarded buses sent from East Germany to take them to the 
railway station, about 1,000 Czechoslovaks clapped repeatedly. The departing 
refugees waved and made the V-for-victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we see the poverty of communism," Charter 77 human rights group member 
Daniel Kummerman told Reuters as thousands got into the buses. "It is sinking 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 18 disgruntled East Germans trying to get to the West sought refuge 
in the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin. An embassy spokesman said American and East 
German diplomats were discussing the next move. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem 'Resolved' 
</P>
<P>
A Czechoslovak government spokesman, Marcel Jansen, said the train shuttle that 
had been expected to start Tuesday had been delayed by people crowding stations 
in East Germany and blocking tracks in the hope of hitching a ride. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem has been resolved," Jansen said, without giving any details. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers arriving at Hof, on the border of the two Germanys, had reported 
large numbers of mainly young people at stations along the route of the 
Prague-bound train. 
</P>

"In Plauen, 20 miles north of (Hof), the train station is said to be totally 
occupied by young people," a West German railway spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
East German church sources reported that police cleared and sealed off the main 
station in Dresden, near the Czechoslovak border, after up to 3,000 people 
swarmed over it and blocked the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
West German television, widely viewed in the East, repeatedly showed an 
interview in which a previous train jumper described how he did it and 
announced the trains' probable route -- that used by previous refugee specials 
last week.

Tow trucks began removing hundreds of East German cars abandoned in Prague by 
those at the embassy, and the state news agency CTK said Prague will hold talks 
with East Berlin on how to dispose of them.

<P>
Visa-Free Travel 
</P>
<P>
East Germany has agreed to allow all its citizens who had come to 
Czechoslovakia to proceed to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand of them arrived at the Prague mission overnight, the last to 
take advantage of visa-free travel to Czechoslovakia that East Berlin 
terminated Tuesday to halt the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
The number of new arrivals slowed today, a sign that the suspension of 
visa-free travel is having its effect. 
</P>
<P>
Police in riot gear patrolled a park at the back of the embassy during the 
night, but officers did not block access to the front. 
</P>
<P>
Plainclothes officers attacked hundreds of East Germans on Tuesday as they 
scaled the fence into the embassy's rear garden. Ten were hurt, one seriously.

in an effort to restore the link to two islands cut off from the South Carolina 
mainland by Hurricane Hugo 13 days ago.

High tide this morning helped lift the 500,000-ton bridge, and workers used a

Officials said they hoped to have the ends of the Ben Sawyer Bridge connected

The British government today signed over the state-owned aircraft and guided 
missile maker Short Brothers to the Canadian group Bombardier. 
</P>
<P>
Bombardier, which makes subway rolling stock and small passenger jets, paid $48 
million for Shorts. The government gave the Montreal firm $1.25 billion in aid 
for the privatization takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"There are exciting times ahead for the aerospace industry, and I feel sure 
that under Bombardier's stewardship, Shorts will prosper," Britain's Northern 
Ireland Minister Peter Brooke told Bombardier Chairman Laurent Beaudoin. 
</P>
<P>
Bombardier defeated a joint bid by Dutch aircraft maker Fokker and Britain's 
General Electric Co. PLC for control of the company. West Germany's 
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm had earlier shown interest in acquiring Shorts, 
which once made biplanes under license for Orville and Wilbur Wright.

U.S. SUES 4 CITIES ON TOXIC WASTE DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government, citing federal Clean Water Act requirements, sued four cities 
today for failing to stop local industrial plants from dumping toxic waste 
water into municipal sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, acting on behalf of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, filed suit against Detroit, Phoenix, San Antonio and El Paso, charging 
that city officials have not enforced federal rules requiring industry to 
remove toxic pollutants from waste water before discharging it into sewers. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said those four cities represent only a tiny fraction of the 
problem nationwide and that 57 other cities -- including San Francisco, for its 
China Basin district, and West Sacramento, Calif. -- already face federal 
penalties for failure to enforce the industrial "pre-treatment" rules. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-treatment of industrial waste water is required under the Clean Water Act 
to ensure toxic pollution is not flushed into rivers and lakes from sewage 
systems, which are not designed to filter out hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are supposed to enforce the pre-treatment requirements by 
setting limits on toxic discharges by industry and then monitoring factories to 
ensure that waste water does not contain pollution levels above those 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Local officials have a legal and moral responsibility . . . to make sure local 
industries abide by the rules," said Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh in announcing 
the lawsuits against the four cities. "Otherwise, they in effect become 
polluters themselves by permitting the very discharge they are supposed to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply cannot allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers and streams 
untreated," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, appearing with Thornburgh at a news 
conference, said the lawsuits against the four cities are part of a continuing 
EPA crackdown on toxic discharges by industry.

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told Congress today that his 
department wants more say in takeovers of U.S. airlines involving foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
He told the Senate aviation subcommittee that it would have been easier if it 
had become involved earlier in the takeover of Northwest Airlines so he could 
have warned the new owners against giving KLM Royal Dutch Airlines so big a 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday the department ordered the group buying Northwest's parent NWA Inc., 
led by financier Alfred A. Checchi, to reduce KLM's role in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, U.S. airlines cannot be controlled by foreigners. The 
original deal would have given the Dutch airline 57% of the non-voting equity 
in Northwest and a seat on its board of directors.

DOW EXTENDS ITS RALLY, SURGES 16.34 TO 2,770.9

<P>
The stock market climbed to record highs for the second straight session today, 
following through on Tuesday's sharp gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.34 to 2,770.90, stretching 
its gain since the start of the week to 78.08 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 812 up, 652 down and 507 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 194.59 million shares, up from 182.55 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.14 to 197.98. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted some "catch-up" buying by investors who were caught off guard by 
the market's revived rally this week. 
</P>
<P>
The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure to persistent 
strength in the dollar and declining interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that the Federal 
Reserve might soon find room to further relax its credit policy, prompted by 
slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable inflation news. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But after hesitating 
for the first two hours of the session, stocks began forging ahead again. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices inched lower in early dealings today in the wake of three 
consecutive advances. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 3/32 point, or nearly $1 for 
every $1,000 in face amount, at midday. Its yield edged up to 8.17% from 8.16% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Morrow, a money market economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said 
traders were awaiting Friday's planned release of employment figures from 
September for an indication of the economy's strength. 
</P>
<P>
He said traders were also looking toward the West German central bank to see if 
it raises a key lending rate later this week in an effort to reinforce its 
efforts to curb the dollar's rise. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices have benefited in recent days from a rise in the dollar, making 
U.S. Treasury notes and bonds more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
slipped 1/16 point, intermediate maturities were off 1/8 point and long-term 
issues were down by between 1/32 point and 3/32 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service said. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
lost 0.88 to 1,173.89. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 
0.52 to 330.30. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.04% as the discount gained 3 
basis points to 7.78%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.30% as the discount 
advanced 4 basis points to 7.87%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.39% as the 
discount rose 3 basis points to 7.80%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/16%, up from 9% late Tuesday.

If Mike Shanahan wants to become an assistant coach again, he is welcome to 
return to the Denver Broncos' staff, head Coach Dan Reeves says. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said that although he has not talked with Shanahan, who was fired 
Tuesday as head coach of the Raiders, he definitely was receptive to discussing 
Shanahan's return to Denver. Shanahan was offensive coordinator with the 
Broncos before going to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule out any possibility," Reeves said. "Mike is a great coach. I 
don't know what his plans are, but I would love to have Mike Shanahan on our 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what capacity he would fill, Reeves said, "Anything but head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan was believed to have two-plus years remaining on his contract with the 
Raiders, a deal that pays him approximately $300,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel badly for Mike because I don't think he was given an opportunity," 
Reeves said.

The Boston Celtics and the Yugoslav basketball team Jugoplastika have reached 
an agreement that will allow forward Dino Radja to join the National Basketball 
Assn. club in a year, a Celtics official said. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Volk, Celtics general manager, said Boston bought out part of Radja's 
contract for an unspecified amount, allowing the 21-year-old Radja to play the 
1989-90 season in Yugoslavia and then join the Celtics. Last week, U.S. 
District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock ruled that Jugoplastika's contract 
with Radja was binding. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-10 Radja was selected by the Celtics in the second round of the NBA 
draft last June and signed to a one-year contract Aug. 1.

The Buffalo Bills today announced they have signed ex-Ram free-agent cornerback 
Mickey Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Sutton on their 47-man roster, the Bills Monday waived kick 
returner Errol Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, 29, spent three years with the Rams before joining the Green Bay 
Packers as a Plan B free agent last winter. He was released last week by the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton will likely replace Tucker as the Bills kickoff and punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton served mostly as a backup cornerback and kick returner with the Rams 
after two seasons in the USFL. With the Rams, he started three games at right 
cornerback in 1987 and has four career interceptions. He has averaged 9.2 yards 
as a punt returner and 18.7 yards returning kickoffs.

NHL OPENING SEASON OF PERSONAL GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the NHL opens its 73rd season with nine games Thursday night, Wayne 
Gretzky will not be the only one shooting for a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
While Gretzky's pursuit of Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record may overshadow 
other individual achievements, several other players also have their eyes on 
new levels. 
</P>
<P>
Three players have a chance this season to reach the career 1,000-point mark, 
and another player has a shot at the 500-goal level. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec's Peter Stastny is closest to 1,000 points, needing just 14 to join the 
exclusive club. Edmonton's Jari Kurri is 50 points away and Chicago's Denis 
Savard 67. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders figures to join the 500-goal club this 
season. He needs just 13 to make it. Trottier also needs 32 assists to move 
past Phil Esposito (873) into fifth place on the all-time assist list. 
</P>
<P>
Four players are gunning for milestones in the assist category. Larry Robinson 
of the Kings is closing in on 700, and Pittsburgh's Paul Coffey, Montreal's 
Bobby Smith and Boston's Ray Bourque are nearing 600. Robinson needs 14 assists 
to reach his milestone, Coffey needs 5, Smith 10 and Bourque 56. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gretzky will continue his pursuit of Howe's scoring record of 1,850 
points when the Los Angeles Kings play host to the Toronto Maple Leafs in one 
of Thursday night's openers. (Story, Part III, Page 1.) The Kings center needs 
just 14 to surpass the Detroit Red Wings' great.

</DATELINE>

<P>
A police officer testified that Houston Astros catcher Craig Biggio handed over 
his driver's license along with two $100 bills shortly before being arrested 
for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came in the trial of Biggio, 23, who pleaded not guilty to a 
misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated. Biggio, who made a public 
apology after his arrest, waived the right to a jury trial, and the case 
continued today before Harris County Court-at-Law Judge Jim Barkley.

<P>
Officer Joel Garza testified Tuesday that he assumed that the cash was offered 
as a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
Garza said he chose not to arrest Biggio for trying to bribe a police officer 
because he was "concentrating more on the DWI" and Biggio never "stated 
anything at all" regarding the cash being a payoff.
