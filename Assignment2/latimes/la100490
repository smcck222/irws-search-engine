EX-KLANSMAN DUKE: HOW'D HE GET SO FAR?; 
</P>
<P>
LOUISIANA'S NEO-NAZI CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a measure of the Founders' genius that the system they bequeathed us 
continues to create opportunities for man's better impulses, while restraining 
his worst. It is a measure of their realism that they never imagined it could 
maintain this balance on its own. 
</P>
<P>
We fall back on such first principles when contemplating neo-Nazi David Duke's 
campaign for one of Louisiana's U.S. Senate seats. After all, like hanging, the 
brimstone whiff of genuine evil concentrates the mind wonderfully. And beneath 
this candidate's blow-dried cant lurks as squalid a man and mind as our system 
has thrown up in many decades. 
</P>
<P>
For most of his 40 years, Duke has migrated through the shadows of America's 
lunatic fringe -- from the science-fiction racism of the tiny American Nazi 
movement to the bare-knuckled white supremacy of the Ku Klux Klan and, finally, 
on to anti-Semitic populism in Louisiana's state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, to the horror of regular Republicans everywhere, he will be one of 
two GOP candidates vying with incumbent Democrat J. Bennett Johnston in an open 
primary for his U.S. Senate seat. Polls put Johnston's support at about 42%; 
Duke's at slightly more than 25%. If neither wins a majority, they will go to a 
run-off in November. 
</P>
<P>
It is a chilling prospect, in large part because Duke seems so aberrant. What 
is remarkable about the South today is how quickly and completely it has thrown 
off the vocal white supremacy that was its political orthodoxy for nearly a 
century. But Louisiana is exceptional in several respects: It has an unmatched 
history of corrupt, ineffectual, demagogic state politics; its economy is the 
worst in the nation with no relief in sight. These are the classic antecedents 
of political extremism. However, for the moment at least, Duke suffers the 
American radical's classic disability: The source of his support is its limit. 
If he disavows his views, he will lose his base; if he does not disavow them, 
he cannot gain new adherents. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ease with which he has melded his own bigotry with the language of 
the respectable conservative social agenda should give this nation pause. 
</P>
<P>
Something has become debased in our national dialogue, and people of goodwill 
must bear the responsibility of self-scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP's Southern strategy has too often made the Party of Lincoln the party 
of racial anxiety. Duke is running as a Republican for a reason. Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush have forthrightly denounced him. But it can be argued that the 
former's mythic welfare queen and the latter's wretched Willie Horton are 
mother and father to the black caricatures Duke dangles in his Punch-and-Judy 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In Duke's hands, demands for a "color-blind society" are cover for something 
else. Similar hands employed "unbiased" literacy tests, constitutional 
comprehension requirements and poll taxes to forestall implementation of the 
15th Amendment for generations. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the studied and continuing antipathy of too many political leaders to 
affirmative action ("quotas"), school integration ("forced busing") and equal 
opportunity ("racial set-asides") has provided a vocabulary of civility that, 
on Duke's lips, is a code for hatred.

U.S. ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arms that the Saudis have been buying for many years proved to be worthless 
when they had to defend themselves against threatened aggression from Iraq. 
Will additional arms enable them to provide for their own defense? 
</P>
<P>
We should only supply arms when we get a commitment that their new ordnance 
will be manned by their own people and will then be used to replace our men and 
weapons.

Bill Stall's comprehensive article on Wilson, (Sept. 24) omitted mentioning a 
timely vote by the senator a few years ago when, following an appendectomy 
operation, he was brought by ambulance from the hospital and into the Senate 
chamber on a gurney in order to provide the deciding vote against an increase 
in Social Security allowances for the elderly.

U.S. ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times (Sept. 21) reported that a Saudi representative said that if the 
United States balks at carrying through on a $20-billion arms deal with the 
Saudis, the sale will go to another country. Doubtless, the defense contractors 
are absolutely ecstatic about closing this deal, especially so since they'd 
also be called upon to supply the Israelis with arms. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis, according to Fred Dutton, the Saudi's Washington representative, 
want the arms to contend with a continuing Iraqi threat. However, isn't it a 
bit premature to be selling them all these arms to forestall a long-range Iraqi 
threat when the current situation hasn't been resolved? 
</P>
<P>
If world, or even Mideast peace, is truly a mutual goal for the United States 
and our allies in this crisis and if there is a chance of establishing a new 
world order, then why not seek a mutual agreement to simply not sell arms in 
this region, and hopefully nowhere else in the world. We and our allies can 
pressure Brazil, China and others to do likewise. Let's at least try. Surely by 
now it's becoming obvious that the arms being sold may well be used against the 
sellers in wars or by terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Let's sincerely make world peace our primary objective. We owe it to all the 
dead and maimed GIs of our previous wars who thought they were fighting to make 
the world safe for democracy.

SMOG ALERTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial ('Smog Watch: Breath Tests," Sept. 15) that supported the 
proposed change in ozone first-stage smog alerts showed greater understanding 
of the health issue involved than the final vote of the state Air Resources 
Board (ARB). 
</P>
<P>
The ARB decision to issue a "health advisory" message to the public instead of 
a first-stage smog alert message undermines years of effort by the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District and the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Our efforts have been directed at increasing the awareness of exercising 
adults, parents of young children, school districts and individuals with 
breathing problems that strenuous physical activities should be rescheduled 
when smog alerts are forecast or attained. 
</P>
<P>
Until we achieve healthful air quality, timely advice for self-protection is 
our lungs' only defense. The ARB decision appears to be a compromise that is 
not in the best interest of public health. We can, and should do better.

Wilson's rhetoric is very familiar. Like George Bush, when running for 
President, Wilson pledges to be the "education governor." 
</P>
<P>
However, he is part of the same class of politicians who have seen constant 
cuts in education -- Ronald Reagan, George Deukmejian and Bush. We cannot 
afford another clone of Reaganomics for our state.

AMONG THE PEOPLE, NO LUST FOR WAR;

<P>
ORDINARY AMERICANS ARE MAKING CALCULATIONS THAT TOOK YEARS TO DEVELOP ABOUT 
VIETNAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Monday morning, the day President Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly, 
found me a mile or so away from U.N. headquarters at Rockefeller Center, 
discussing the gulf crisis on the Phil Donahue show with Ralph Nader and 
Richard Barnett of the Institute for Policy Studies. What struck me in the 
course of our highly critical examination of the Bush Administration's policy 
was that not a single member of the large studio audience called for war or 
suggested that this was a cause in which American lives might justly be 
sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
This was a crowd of about 200 people, from New York area and around the 
country, who'd sent in for tickets to be in a Donahue studio audience weeks 
ago. By far the loudest cheers followed charges from Nader that the people 
doing well out of this crisis are the oil companies, the arms manufacturers and 
the big agricultural and commercial interests who had been urging appeasement 
of Saddam Hussein before the invasion took place. 
</P>
<P>
The studio reaction was certainly striking to me in light of the torrent of 
stories in the press, plainly intimidating to the Democrats, suggesting that 
Bush's policy since Aug. 2, the day of the invasion, had won overwhelming 
popular backing. No doubt there is support for the rapid and entirely proper 
imposition of sanctions by the U.N. Security Council in the wake of Iraq's 
seizure of Kuwait, but that's where the certainty seems to end. That same 
Monday morning, the papers carried reports of a poll conducted for a bipartisan 
group of political consulting firms. The results showed that just one in 10 
Americans favors war at this point. Nearly half of the thousand people surveyed 
said they thought that if the Bush Administration launched a war it would lie 
to them and claim the Iraqis started it. 
</P>
<P>
American soldiers in Saudi Arabia tell reporters that the thing that worries 
them most is the possibility of loss of public support back home, as happened 
in the war in Vietnam. The ingredients of just such a loss of confidence are 
already there. The fact that right up until the invasion the State Department 
sent out strong public signals that the United States would not take sides in 
any Arab-Arab border dispute is now sinking into the popular mind. 
</P>
<P>
There were gasps from the Donahue audience as U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie's 
amiable discussions with Hussein in Baghdad on July 25 were scrolled down the 
studio TV monitors. The audience followed with keen attention suggestions that 
what the Administration was actually doing in the pre-invasion days was trying 
to nudge Kuwait into halting its overproduction of oil beyond OPEC guidelines 
and thus allay Hussein's furious charges that the emirate had declared economic 
war on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein: "Twenty-five dollars a barrel is not a high price." 
</P>
<P>
Glaspie: "We have many Americans who would like to see the price go above $25 
because they come from oil-producing states." 
</P>
<P>
From the questions raised by this exchange -- after all, the President and 
secretary of state have roots in the Southwest -- it is no great leap to 
strenuous questions about the leap of oil to $40 a barrel. Why have oil prices 
risen 100% in response to a supply drop now running less than 2.5% of world 
output? How come U.S. oil companies exported oil to Europe in September because 
prices were higher there? These are the sorts of questions that the folks in 
Donahue's studio applauded. 
</P>
<P>
If war is the extension of politics by other means, it is also a particularly 
dramatic display of the class system. Rich men start wars and poor people fight 
them. The day after Bush's speech to the United Nations came details of the 
budget deal hatched on Capitol Hill. Toss the colossal red herring of the 
capital gains tax fight to one side and the outline of one more familiar plot 
to shaft the middle-class wage-earner looms into view. 
</P>
<P>
The people on the receiving end of the proposed tax package are the people 
already bruised by the rising gas prices and among them are those who will be 
doing the fighting and dying in any war in the gulf. On one TV program, I saw a 
soldier in Saudi Arabia say that he thought he and his fellows were there to 
knock a few cents off the price of gas at the pump. What will he think as he 
reads of the prospective gas tax increase of 12 cents a gallon? 
</P>
<P>
An inevitable consequence of any substantial war is domestic political upheaval 
as the bodies come home and people figure out who is doing the bleeding. There 
are signs that in this crisis people are making the calculations that it took 
them years to get to in Vietnam. Let us hope that President Bush reflects on 
this as he is belabored by the urgings of the war faction.

HOW TO WIN A SEAT ON THE COURT; 
</P>
<P>
A SUCCESSFUL NOMINEE NOW ESPOUSES A LITTLE BIT OF PRIVACY AND LOT OF 
ORIGINALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
David Souter's confirmation testimony sheds light on the kind of judicial 
philosophy now likely to pass muster with a confirming Senate. And here the 
news is far better for conservatives than liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Since the confirmation battle over Robert Bork, the great concern of Senate 
liberals has been judicial protection of an unenumerated right of privacy. So 
it was that the first question of the hearing on Souter's nomination to the 
Supreme Court came from Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and went to the 
privacy issue. "I believe," Souter immediately responded as though reciting a 
holy creed, "that the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment does recognize 
and does protect an unenumerated right of privacy." A delighted Biden 
interrupted apologetically to say he liked "what you are saying." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bork never said that, and that was one reason he was not confirmed. 
Anthony M. Kennedy, by contrast, embraced an unenumerated privacy right. That 
position paved the way for his confirmation, just as it did for Souter's. 
Commitment to an unenumerated right of privacy is the Senate's litmus test in 
the post-Bork era. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives nervous about a Supreme Court nominee's acceptance of rights not 
found in the text or history of the Constitution ought to relax, especially 
after reflecting upon the nuances of Souter's position. Souter took care not to 
accept the results in any of the modern privacy decisions, including those 
striking down laws prohibiting the use of contraceptives (Griswold vs. 
Connecticut) and restricting abortion (Roe vs. Wade). And the only kind of 
unenumerated right of privacy he specifically endorsed lies in the marital 
context. Souter, it bears noting, did not endorse privacy in the sense of 
"lifestyle" autonomy, the bedrock concern of many liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Souter thus is positioned to line up with Justice Byron R. White, a prospect 
conservatives can hardly refuse to applaud. White was in the majority on 
Griswold in 1965 but dissented in and now is poised to overturn Roe. And he 
wrote the court's opinion in a 1986 case, Bowers vs. Hardwick, declining to 
extend the right of privacy to homosexual sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
One irony of the Souter hearings is that the amount of time spent on the 
unenumerated right of privacy is inverse to the amount of time the court 
devotes to the subject. The court has few such cases, outside of abortion. Once 
that troubled area of the law is healed, preferably through the demise of Roe, 
the court will be even less pestered by privacy claims. It helps, of course, 
that justices appointed by Reagan and Bush now dominate. 
</P>
<P>
There is another irony of the Souter hearings, one that ought to delight 
conservatives. The vote against Bork, it used to be said by liberals, was also 
a vote against the approach to constitutional interpretation he espoused -- 
original intent. But Souter accomplished nothing less than the rehabilitation 
of this philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Originalism has been rudely caricatured in a way Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
helped encourage. In a 1985 speech, Brennan described original intent as the 
view "that justices discern exactly what the Framers thought about the question 
under consideration and simply follow that intention in resolving the case." 
Brennan called this "arrogance cloaked as humility." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his testimony Souter repeatedly characterized himself as an 
originalist, but took care to show that his was not the straw-man's version. 
Souter plainly stated that he would repair to text and history to discern 
original principles but that the application of these principles cannot be 
confirmed to the specific objects in the minds of the Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Irony of ironies, this was Bork's view. "It is the modern judge's task," he 
wrote in 1985, "to determine whether (a constitutional) right applies to 
circumstance that did not even exist in contemplation when the Framers acted. 
He cannot confine himself to the specifics they had in mind, for to do so would 
make rights dwindle when, for example, technology changed." 
</P>
<P>
It has become a cliche to say that Souter is about the best conservatives or 
liberals could hope for. But his testimony suggests that the politics of 
judicial nominations heavily favors conservatives. Other things equal, a little 
bit of privacy and a lot of originalism, in tension as those things may be, now 
constitute the judicial philosophy that make a nominee into an appointee. 
</P>
<P>
Despairing liberals in and out of the Senate might respond to this by trying to 
impose more than a minimal privacy test on future nominees. They would be 
better advised to quit their unrewarding effort to leverage the court's 
jurisprudence from the halls of the Senate. Strange as it is to have to state 
the obvious, if liberals do not want a conservative court, they are going to 
have to elect a liberal President.

Play Delay: "M. Butterfly" won't arrive at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly 
Hills until March or July, said a spokesman for the touring production of the 
Tony-winning play, which just opened in Boston with a $1-million advance sale. 
The Los Angeles run had been scheduled for Dec. 4-30, but the spokesman said 
the producers now want a longer Los Angeles stay -- of at least five weeks -- 
and the only openings in the show's tour that would allow the longer run are in 
March or July. BETH KLEID

Exhibit Grows in Brooklyn: The Brooklyn Museum is showing deliberately 
"objectionable" artworks funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials culled the display of nude children, embracing lesbians and 
homo-erotic paintings from their own collection, in response to what they call 
the current climate of censorship. The exhibit, "The Brooklyn Museum 
Collection: The Play of the Unmentionable," also includes Robert Mapplethorpe 
photographs. It runs until Dec. 4. NEA spokeswoman Virginia Falck said Tuesday 
the endowment was not aware of the nature of the exhibit and was "looking into 
it." BETH KLEID

Same Ol' Morning: Don't set your alarms to watch the new longer version of 
KCBS' local morning news. Last week KCBS-TV Channel 2 announced plans for an 
hourlong newscast that would bump the "CBS Morning News" at 6:30 a.m., but the 
announcement was too hasty. CBS executives did not approve the plan, and KCBS' 
30-minute news program will continue per usual, a station spokeswoman said.

able to finance the $5.6-million production. The musical, starring Barry 
Bostwick and Joanna Gleason as Dashiell Hammett's famous detective couple, was 
to have opened in February. It is one of the most highly touted musicals of the 
season, one of the few big American shows expected to compete with the British 
blockbuster "Miss Saigon."

BUZZIN' 'BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When there's no keyboard in sight, just a row of fretboards lined up next to 
the drum riser, you know you're in for a Guitar Band. This durable, 
alternative-rock subgenre got a slight twist at the Whisky on Tuesday from the 
Hummingbirds, who are from Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the two-man, two-woman outfit stands far apart from such U.S. brethren 
as Let's Active, the dB's and the Feelies. The 'birds' debut album "Love Buzz" 
was produced by power-pop guru Mitch Easter, and on stage they displayed the 
same allegiance to '60s pop values, a punk-inspired intensity, and a fondness 
for making their guitars buzz, squeal, roar, ring, jangle, shimmer, chop, 
rattle, whoosh and sometimes play a tune. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the solos were conventionally musical; mainly, they were intensifying 
exchanges of percussive charges, or racing strums that took them into the realm 
of pure rhythm. They also offered some into-the-breach heroics, a bit of 
Television's lock-step design -- but not much showmanship. RICHARD CROMELIN

IGHNER TAKES THE SLOW LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benard Ighner, one of the most misspelled names on the vocal scene, is also one 
of the most misguided singers ever to waste a splendid talent. The evidence was 
clear Tuesday at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with the Miles Davis waltz "All Blues" -- hardly a blockbuster, but a 
fair-enough vehicle for his deep, resonant baritone -- he slowed things further 
with "The Look of Love," using a somewhat stiff trio backing, then hit pop 
bottom with "People." How can a composer capable of writing "Everything Must 
Change" waste himself on these banal lyrics at this dreary tempo? 
</P>
<P>
After his own "Little Dreamer," which at least had a beat of sorts, he slowed 
it down yet again for an almost soporific "Dindi," then accompanied himself at 
the piano for "Everything Must Change." 
</P>
<P>
Ighner then brought on his sister Sandra, a most attractive woman with a warm, 
appealing voice, but did she change the tempo, or offer one of her brother's 
songs? Au contraire -- she offered those brand-new items "My Funny Valentine" 
and, on her own, "Lover Man" -- at the same largo tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Not until 55 minutes into the show, as his closer, did Ighner offer the kind of 
song he should have been using occasionally all along: he woke us all up with 
"Stormy Monday," which had a good feel. The trio swung; the room came alive. 
</P>
<P>
Ighner is one of those people who need people -- to advise him on how to put 
together an act. LEONARD FEATHER

S.F. 'BEAUTY' CHOOSES A STRANGE TIME TO SLEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Sleeping Beauty," as staged last season by Helgi Tomasson for the San 
Francisco Ballet, is stylish and stimulating. The $745,000 production may 
stretch company resources to the limit, but the stretch obviously invigorates 
all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
From lofty ballerina to lowly corps member, the dancers honor the exalted 
Petipa tradition. Most of Tomasson's choreographic additions and subtractions 
make good sense. Jens-Jacob Worsaae has created lavish-looking, ever-tasteful 
designs that falter only in the would-be magical transformations. 
</P>
<P>
At the Civic Theatre on Tuesday, Denis de Coteau defended Tchaikovsky nobly in 
the pit, leading a rough but ready pick-up ensemble called the International 
Symphony Orchestra of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco production has been hailed, justifiably, as a thinking 
person's "Sleeping Beauty." For some thinkers, however, it does create certain 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them relate to Tomasson's provocative decision to impose a very 
specific time and place on the action. The first act makes Princess Aurora an 
Imperial ingenue in 17th-Century Russia. After Carabosse (here labeled the 
Fairy of Darkness) does her wicked deed and the heroine-cum-entourage take 
their 100-year nap, everyone wakes up amid the gallic fripperies of the Baroque 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The focus on temporal credibility -- intended, no doubt, to commemorate the 
100th anniversary of the "Sleeping Beauty" premiere in St. Petersburg -- raises 
simplistic yet stubbornly irksome questions: 
</P>
<P>
If Aurora was, as we are told, the daughter of the czar, didn't the somnolent 
century leave something of a gap in Russian history? 
</P>
<P>
Didn't anyone usurp the throne while the czar slept? 
</P>
<P>
Could the ruler really open his Byzantine eyes after all those decades, don a 
powdered wig and proclaim, "I still am czar"? 
</P>
<P>
What, moreover, are all those winged creatures in tutus doing in the literal 
domain of boyars and Cossacks, the world of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the 
Great? 
</P>
<P>
Fairy tales are supposed to be timeless. That is what makes them universally 
poignant. They are best accommodated in neutral never-never lands. For all his 
clever invention, Tomasson might have been wise to leave Godunov alone. 
</P>
<P>
Still. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In these days of tired traditions and nostalgic corruptions, one must be 
grateful for a production that has a fresh point of view, however wrong-headed. 
And one must be grateful for a production that is so sensitively executed. 
</P>
<P>
Sabina Allemann, remembered in Southern California for her feverish Tatiana and 
quizzical Alice with the National Ballet of Canada, dominated -- and validated 
-- the evening as Aurora. Womanly rather than girlish, she exuded radiance at 
the heroine's coming-out party, ethereal mystery in the oddly rechoreographed 
vision scene and grandiose rapture at the ultimate wedding celebration. 
</P>
<P>
She moved through the ornate scenic jungle with smiling determination and 
staggering technical security. She phrased with lyrical purity throughout, made 
the clock stop in the balances of the Rose Adagio, and threw herself into the 
classic fishdives of the finale with reckless bravado masquerading as 
innocence. She is a ballerina -- the rare, real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley Wheater, formerly a Joffrey hero, partnered her attentively as a tall, 
strong, uncommonly aristocratic and somewhat mannered Prince Desire. Pascale 
Leroy, formerly a Petit soloist in Marseilles, introduced an elegant if 
less-than-magnetic Lilac Fairy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bluebird divertissement, the piquant refinement of Elizabeth Loscavio 
nicely offset the airy glee of Andre Reyes. Galina Alexandrova, formerly of the 
Bolshoi, attracted special attention among the splendid supporting dancers as a 
fleet secondary fairy and as a genuinely seductive feline. 
</P>
<P>
Tomasson has toned up the mime episodes while toning down the traditional 
caricature. Under the circumstances, Anita Paciotti emerged as a forceful but 
hardly grotesque Carabosse, and Tomm Ruud lost nary a hair as the put-upon 
Cattalabutte. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego audience, which left about a third of the 3,000 seats empty, 
mustered no applause for the ballerina's entrance. The enthusiasm level rose 
appreciably, however, soon thereafter.

FOX'S 'BEVERLY HILLS, 90210': ZIP CODE FOR CLICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've been sitting on the edge of your seats and holding your breath waiting 
for this beauty, right? So here it is, the new Fox drama series that "explores 
the realities and myths of social classes in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute premiere of "Beverly Hills, 90210" airs at 8:30 tonight on 
Channels 11 and 6 (its regular time slot will be Thursdays at 9 p.m.), giving 
you the feeling you've been watching for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the scoop: A family from Minneapolis, where the values are good, moves 
to Beverly Hills, where the values are bad. The opening story is about 
assimilation, with 16-year-old twins Brandon and Brenda Walsh (Jason Priestley 
and Shannen Doherty) pitting their great values against the lousy values of 
their rich, pampered and hedonistic classmates at West Beverly High. 
</P>
<P>
Whose values win? It looks pretty bad for Brandon and Brenda at first, but, 
well, you can take the kids out of the Midwest, but not the Midwest out of the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
A ZIP code for stereotypes and stock characters, "Beverly Hills, 92010" is 
nothing if not predictable, with the twins each facing moral choices and 
ultimately doing the right thing, presumably because they're from Minneapolis. 
The story really goes over the edge when Brandon -- feeling guilty about 
perpetuating a false rumor that he had sex with one of his fetching female 
classmates -- announces on the school radio station that "nothing happened" on 
their hot-tubbing date. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, West Beverly High and its student body of indulged brats and future 
Zsas Zsas is the kind of school you'd like to hit with a giant cream pie. After 
a freshman smashes up his fancy car, the school's BMOC cries out: "What did I 
do to deserve meeting a dork like this?" Exactly your feeling as the credits 
roll by.

CULTURAL AWARENESS SESSIONS AT CENTINELA; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SEEKING TO DEFUSE RACIAL CONFLICTS, STUDENTS AT LEUZINGER AND 
HAWTHORNE HIGH SCHOOLS TALK ABOUT HOW THEIR ETHNICITY AFFECTS THE WAY TEACHERS 
TREAT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bit of role reversal, two student panels fielded questions from teachers 
in the Centinela Valley Union High School District this week as part of a 
program aimed at broadening cultural awareness to avoid the racial tensions 
that divided the district last year. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member panels at Leuzinger and Hawthorne high schools represented a 
diverse range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. After discussing how their 
ethnicity affects the way they are treated by teachers and other students at 
school, the panelists were then asked to provide suggestions for promoting 
harmony in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of their comments about teachers and the schools were positive, a 
few students expressed frustration at what they perceived as cultural ignorance 
and insensitivity by some of their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you have a Hispanic name, immediately a teacher thinks you're 
Mexican," said Jorge Guandigue, a senior at Leuzinger High School who emigrated 
from El Salvador two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rodrick Horne, a senior at Leuzinger who is black, was critical of some 
teachers' selection of material for their classes. "There's not enough about 
our race in the books. I'd like to learn about my people, what they were like 
and what they did." 
</P>
<P>
The student panels, which met for about an hour Monday morning, launched the 
first of what will be six days of staff development and training programs 
scheduled throughout the school year. Teachers spent the rest of the day in 
seminars on cultural characteristics and stereotypes, teaching techniques and 
building self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The training comes as teachers, students and administrators try to make sense 
of the racial divisiveness that erupted into allegations that blacks are not 
treated fairly in the district and led to a two-day student walkout in March. 
The allegations continued through the summer when trustees fired Supt. McKinley 
Nash and demoted Hawthorne Principal Kenneth Crowe, both of whom are black. 
Crowe has since left the district. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela Valley has seen drastic demographic changes over the past 10 years. 
Once predominantly white, the student population today is 53.4% Latino, 18.4% 
black and 8.5% Asian. About 80% of the teachers are Anglo. Four of the five 
school board members are Latino and one is Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is investigating 
the allegations of racism, and several lawsuits have been filed against the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a state report on racial tensions recommended that the district 
develop programs to reduce racial conflicts, including the appointment of an 
ombudsman to look into complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Although an ombudsman has yet to be appointed, the district contends that it 
has already put into effect many of the recommendations. In its own 
investigation, the district concluded that the disruptions were the product of 
a conspiracy by school employees intent on discrediting the school board for 
political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Many students on Leuzinger's panel indicated they would like to put the events 
of last spring behind them. But some of the teachers' questions, which were 
passed forward on index cards, made it clear the adults were still looking for 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you think the perception arose that teachers and staff are uncaring and 
racist and create other problems?" the students were asked. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Tyson, a senior at R. K. Lloyde Continuation High who is black, said he 
believed that the allegations reflect that some teachers are indeed prejudiced. 
When they make biased statements, he said, "they think other people don't hear 
it, but then it gets around." Tyson was part of the Leuzinger panel. 
</P>
<P>
But Courtney Day, a senior at Leuzinger who also is black, disagreed: "I think 
there's a stereotypical image in students' minds that all teachers are tyrants, 
so that when things come up and students are primarily wrong . . . they come up 
with these stories, trying to portray teachers negatively. 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes on, there is an image that teachers are racist," she said. "It's 
really based on a lot of rumors and untruths." 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers later said they were surprised to discover that most of the 
students said they thought highly of them and the school. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it was a nice, big, warm fuzzy," said Leuzinger social studies teacher 
Nancy Nuesseler, a former union president who came under fire last year after 
she called Nash a "Stepin Fetchit" for state Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig, a remark that some people considered racially 
insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers, however, said they were struck by the negative experiences some 
of the students conveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Magdalena Alvarez, a Leuzinger employee who serves as a community liaison, said 
the students' comments showed that "they want teachers to be aware of where 
they're coming from and who they are. What they mainly resent is that we don't 
know much about their cultures." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger science teacher Nikki Jones, who is black, said: "I thought it was 
pretty interesting that some of the kids picked up on things going on with the 
adults. They see things that a lot of teachers won't recognize -- the tension 
between the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
A few teachers said the students' comments merely confirmed what they already 
knew. Others said they regarded the cultural training sessions as punishment 
for the events of last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign language department Chairwoman Linda Cummings, who is Anglo, said: "A 
lot of people felt, 'Why are we doing penance for past wrongs when the people 
who were responsible for that were fired or left the district?' " 
</P>
<P>
Although she said she sometimes felt the students' answers needed clarification 
and that the discussion was too short to be really useful, Cummings said she 
was "pleased that they seemed in general to perceive teachers as helpful and 
cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
The student panels were the brainchild of Jo Bonita Smith Perez, a 
multicultural educational consultant with the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education, who was brought to the district after teachers expressed a desire to 
learn more about the ethnic and cultural groups that make up the student 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher-training sessions were made possible by a state-funded program 
aimed at improving instructional practices, student attendance and school 
environments. The funding allows the schools to schedule student-free days for 
teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1990-91 school year, Centinela Valley received $93,000 in state funding 
and allocated an additional $80,000 in general fund money for the program. It 
will devote one-third of its training sessions to multicultural awareness. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of Monday's program, Perez said the best lesson of the day was found 
during Leuzinger's student panel, when senior Long Trinh described the pain of 
leaving his parents in Vietnam and his shock in learning soon after that his 
father had died. As Long began to cry, Tyson, the senior at Lloyde Continuation 
High, put his arm around him. 
</P>
<P>
"What they generated spontaneously is what we want to see happen in the 
classroom," Perez said. "The physical closeness, the empathy, the laughing with 
each other and joking with each other comfortably. Many people might not have 
noticed that, but that meant a whole lot of space-sharing and acceptance. It 
was a graphic illustration to teachers that they can also demonstrate those 
kinds of feeling in accepting kids (of) different backgrounds."

CARSON PARKS DIRECTOR QUITS AMID DISCORD OVER CITY BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
SPENDING: OFFICIALS SAY HOWARD HOMAN RESIGNED AND LEFT ON VACATION THIS WEEK. 
HE HAD BEEN PARKS AND RECREATION DIRECTOR SINCE 1969. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson's parks and recreation director has resigned from his job, while the 
City Council this week continued budget deliberations that targeted his 
department for the steepest cuts. 
</P>
<P>
City officials insist there is no connection between the resignation of parks 
Director Howard Homan and the ongoing, often acrimonious budget negotiations. 
However, community members and city staff speculate that Homan's resignation 
was forced by the City Council and City Administrator Jack Smith because of 
Homan's outspokenness in opposing proposed cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Homan, who has been the city's only parks and recreation director since the 
position was created in 1969, went on vacation Tuesday and has been unavailable 
for comment. He resigned Monday, according to Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt and 
Councilman Michael Mitoma, but it was unclear when his resignation takes 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt and Mitoma declined comment on the circumstances of the resignation, 
saying the issue is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
Homan's departure comes at a time when the council is deliberating on a 
$29.2-million spending package for the 1990-91 fiscal year. The proposed budget 
represents a decrease of $700,000 from what the city spent last year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed parks and recreation budget of $6.1 million for 1990-91 is $2 
million less than the previous budget of $8.1 million. About five full-time and 
30 part-time parks and recreation positions, many of which are vacant, are 
proposed for deletion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the latest proposal, park hours would be reduced in the summer months and 
during the city's 12 holidays, and would be closed Sundays during the winter 
months. In addition, volunteers, instead of paid city employees, would be 
encouraged to officiate all sports activities. 
</P>
<P>
The council hopes to vote on the 1990-91 spending plan at its Oct. 16 meeting, 
more than three months into the fiscal year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the council passed a $34.8-million budget but spent only $29.9 
million after instituting a hiring freeze and cuts in capital purchases midway 
through the year to keep down an anticipated deficit. However, the city still 
spent $2.2 million from its reserves to balance the 1989-90 fiscal budget. 
There is now $7 million in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt, who pledged in April when she became mayor to come up with "a balanced 
budget document in a timely manner," has publicly criticized Homan and other 
department heads on numerous occasions for the delay in getting a budget 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, DeWitt said: "There's no relationship at all" between her 
criticism of Homan and his decision to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Homan has said that what the council wanted in terms of a parks and recreation 
budget "was never that clear." The Parks and Recreation Department's initial 
budget proposal of $9.1 million was pared down to $6.1 million after several 
revisions were ordered by the council and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Clayton, a longtime Carson community activist, speculated Wednesday that 
Homan was forced to resign and faced termination if he refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe for a minute that Howard would voluntarily resign," Clayton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton also aired his allegations at Tuesday's council meeting, along with 
another community activist, Milton Flores. Both said they had been told by city 
insiders that Homan had been fired. Homan did not attend Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clayton said Homan's resignation was related to continued clashes 
with City Administrator Smith over the parks and recreation budget, in light of 
anticipated city cutbacks. Smith declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Homan has been "uncooperative with the city administrator," Clayton said. 
"(Homan) feels he knows what will and won't work. He knows what it takes to 
make the department work. He voiced his opinion," but the council and Smith 
"didn't like it," Clayton said.

DICE ARE ALSO ON THE WAY FROM LITTON WORKERS.

Kathy Davidson and her colleagues have vowed to take care of the needs of a 
group of American troops in the Mideast for the duration, sending them letters, 
soap, detergent, magazines and other necessities for a desert vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Like toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
Toilet paper, it seems, is the No. 1 item on the wish list of an isolated 
military force. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no grocery stores where your Marine can just go and pick up a roll, 
and their meal kits contain only four to five sheets of single ply," said 
Gunnery Sgt. Bob Torres, a spokesman for the U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see why it's our top priority until the portable PXs get set up." 
</P>
<P>
Surprised at the need but determined to do their patriotic duty, Davidson and 
some of her fellow employees at Litton Guidance &amp; Control Systems in 
Woodland Hills started loading up shopping carts with goods for the troops 
about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, they finished boxing 111 rolls of toilet paper and other goods 
totaling 380 pounds. The packages, which Litton will pay to ship to Saudi 
Arabia, also contain 140 packages of chewing gum, 400 envelopes, 32 batteries, 
75 dozen pens and pencils and two packages of dice for shooting craps. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Tell us what you need and you got it,' " said Davidson, 53, a project 
coordinator whose 21-year-old son is planning to join the Navy in June. 
</P>
<P>
The goodies were divided into four packages -- one for each branch of the 
service. Each box also contains a photograph of the 13 people in Davidson's 
work group who started the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's refreshing to see something being done this time around for the 
soldiers," said Phil Ballensky, a Vietnam veteran and Litton employee who 
donated about 400 hard candies that will not melt in the desert heat. "Whether 
you believe in what the government is doing or not, they're over there on our 
behalf." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson's group is just one of many in the Southland to start letter-writing 
campaigns or send gift packages to military personnel overseas, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
"Marines love their 'M&amp;Ms' -- meals and mail," he said. "That's why I push 
so much for people to write." 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Cress, 47, a Litton project coordinator, said the 66 packages of 
snacks he and others donated will have to suffice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a good letter writer -- Cornnuts will have to do," Cress said.

UNEMPLOYMENT: CUTS IN STATE FUNDS SET BACK HOPES OF INDEPENDENCE FOR A CREW OF 
GROUNDSKEEPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
State budget cuts mean more than just numbers on a page to George Schwenk, one 
of eight people with mental disabilities who began working with the grounds 
maintenance crew at Pierce College this summer, only to be laid off a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
For Schwenk, 38, the budget-triggered layoff was a setback in his quest for an 
independent adult life, a quest that began more than seven years ago when he 
left home to participate in a state-funded work training program. 
</P>
<P>
Schwenk was one of the most recent victims of a wave of state budget cuts that 
hit Pierce College, beginning last spring and continuing through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sad," Schwenk said Wednesday, reflecting on his and his fellow 
workers' reaction to losing their full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been trying to keep busy -- walking, riding his bike and 
wandering in a shopping mall, imagining what it would be like to work there. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the training program's assistance, finding new work "takes time" for 
those with disabilities, Schwenk said. "You have to be honest with yourself. 
You don't want to get into a job you can't handle and have to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the men and women stopped working at Pierce, their thorough 
raking, sweeping and trash pickup were already missed, said Bernardine 
Pregerson, a microbiology instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very demoralizing on campus now to see the filth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty introduced by the budget undulations put Schwenk and other 
clients of Work Training Programs Inc. of Chatsworth on an emotional roller 
coaster. The agency, funded by the state Department of Rehabilitation and the 
Department of Developmental Services, guides participants through a progression 
of training, working and living situations aimed at achieving independence from 
their families and from government support. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, eight clients of the Chatsworth agency were hired by Pierce under a 
20-week contract, which campus officials said was renewed in February. Then 
they were told in April that their contract would be canceled in 30 days, as 
part of an effort to make up a nearly $1-million deficit faced by the Los 
Angeles Community College District, which administers Pierce and eight other 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the college district Board of Trustees approved another 20-week 
contract. Two of the original group of eight, who quit lower-paying jobs to 
return to Pierce, were joined by Schwenk and five other new workers, said Gail 
Peters, manager of Work Training Programs. 
</P>
<P>
But days before they were to start in July, Peters received a call from Pierce 
College President Dan Means saying the financial picture had changed again: 
$1.2 million had been sliced from the Pierce College budget by the district, 
partly because state lottery revenues were lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing was terrible," Means said. "We had to let them go again, which I 
was sorry to see. . . . The cuts were just so large; it was a big hunk of 
money. And we had to protect the educational programs." 
</P>
<P>
The crew had done such a good job and the college felt so responsible for 
giving them false hope that the Pierce College Foundation agreed to support the 
program for a month, at a cost of about $5,700, Means said. 
</P>
<P>
College administrators suggested that the workers could continue helping out 
their maintenance crews as unpaid volunteers until they found other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Peters rejected that as inappropriate, but she took the blame for misleading 
college administrators into thinking that was an option by mentioning volunteer 
programs her agency coordinates for other, less-skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not normal for an able-bodied, hard-working adult to go to work some 
place for no pay and our program is developed around normalization with a 
capital N," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwenk is involved in the segment of the program for the most independent 
participants. He lives in a Canoga Park apartment with another program client. 
Like others among the Work Training Programs clients, he cannot read, but in 
the past has managed to work in areas such as maintenance, factory assembly and 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Program instructors emphasize saving for unexpected unemployment, which Peters 
said is common. All eight of the men and women laid off from Pierce also 
receive Social Security disability payments of up to $630 a month. 
</P>
<P>
None of the eight has a new job yet, Peters said. She is optimistic, however, 
that she will be able to find employment for all of them within a month. 
</P>
<P>
"This group here is a group that could handle any kind of job," she said.

PEOPLE: TRAIN FANCIER BUILDS OWN RAIL YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few years back Alan Bledsoe admired a working model train in a store window 
and decided it would look perfect under his Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he bought another train set, and then another, and another and another 
and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe, 41, became so infatuated with model locomotives and cars that he even 
kept a train set he bought for his younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
Soon trains were running throughout the house and even through a passageway he 
cut through the wall and out to the patio and back. 
</P>
<P>
Now the perimeters of the back yard at his Yorba Linda home have been 
transformed into a landscaped train thoroughfare with its own depot. 
</P>
<P>
The moving steam locomotive and cars that make up the trains, some stretching 
30 feet, look and sound like the real thing, complete with the huffing and 
chuffing and the clickity clack from the iron wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The train also blares out its impending arrival with blasts from a steam horn. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't stop buying them," said Bledsoe, who works for his father, an 
Anaheim cement contractor. "It slowly kept getting bigger and bigger until it 
took over the inside of the house." 
</P>
<P>
So Bledsoe had no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
He took the G gauge model trains outside. When they are not in use he stores 
them in a caboose he built. It is 18 feet long and 12 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of it is a dollhouse and the other half is for the trains," he said. "I 
made a deal with my three daughters that if I could take down their dollhouse 
in the back yard they could use half of the caboose." 
</P>
<P>
The caboose also houses the controls for the eight locomotives and 300 cars 
that make up his sizable train inventory. 
</P>
<P>
He has other train sets, including the first he ever bought, but they are kept 
on display shelves in his house. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I've always liked real trains, and now I like these, and I wish I 
could explain why," said Bledsoe, as he watched his train chug through his 
self-built forest and across his rivers and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's the little boy in me," he theorized. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, and that feeling might account for the estimated 330 other rail 
fanciers who have joined the Los Angeles Garden Railway Society that Bledsoe 
helped start less than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members from Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside counties share a 
growing interest in back-yard railroading, says Bledsoe, who plans to enlarge 
his own setup. 
</P>
<P>
It also solves the problem of a busy life that prevents the Bledsoe family from 
getting away. 
</P>
<P>
"Having this for a hobby at the house works out well for the whole family," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe and other members of the train society, who pay a $40 yearly fee, often 
hold open house to show off their innovative setups. 
</P>
<P>
And while most of the members are in their 20s, many are retired people, who 
usually have the nicest layouts since they have more time to devote to them. 
"Lots of people are getting a lot of joy out of landscaping their yards with 
trees, lakes, houses, miniature people, animals and trains," he said. "It's 
becoming very popular."

LOMITA WEIGHS NEW HEIGHT LIMIT ON RESIDENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNICE HIRABAYASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lomita City Council members have asked city staff to draw up an ordinance 
limiting the height of all residential structures in the city to 27 feet, down 
three feet from the current limit. 
</P>
<P>
The request, made Monday night, for a citywide height limit grew out of a 
discussion on a separate measure, an amendment to the city's 1987 view 
protection law. One of the provisions in the amendment would be to limit the 
height of residences south of Pacific Coast Highway to 27 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"But 27 feet in the view area," Councilman Harold Croyts said, "is really what 
we would like to see throughout the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
Croyts said the council had talked about lowering the height limit for years, 
but it wasn't until recently that the city started to receive complaints about 
30-foot-tall residences. 
</P>
<P>
After the staff draws up the proposed ordinance, the Planning Commission will 
study it and hold public hearings before passing it back to the council for a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ordinance, the council considered the proposed amendment to 
the view protection law, which would move the boundary farther south of Pacific 
Coast Highway, to where the hilly area of Lomita begins. All homes south of 
that boundary would be part of the view protection area. 
</P>
<P>
This would exempt flat areas south of Pacific Coast Highway from needing a 
height variance permit for buildings over 16 feet high. The Building Department 
traditionally does not receive building height complaints in that area and the 
exemption would save the city time and money, said City Planner Richard 
Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
It would also save the builder a $300 application fee and the trouble of 
building a "silhouette" so city workers and neighbors could get a better idea 
of what the proposed structure would look like. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment also defined what would be considered a view and how 
much of it could be legally obstructed. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the proposed amendment to the view protection ordinance was 
scheduled for Oct. 15.

A LESSON IN GRAFFITI

<P>
Will the persons responsible for the graffiti on the Hollywood, Ventura and San 
Diego freeways please stop. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway driving is ugly enough. I do not need you to make it more unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
And will the department in charge of removing graffiti from public areas please 
do so. I have had to look at this filth for too long. 
</P>
<P>
And will the parents of these individuals, since you have failed in raising 
these hoodlums, at least teach them to spell. "The" is not spelled t-h-a.

DEPUTIES HELD NOT NEGLIGENT IN STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Torrance Superior Court jury has concluded that sheriff's deputies were not 
negligent when they failed to warn Lawndale residents that a man ranting about 
a bomb had barricaded himself inside a nearby office building. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents of an apartment complex across the street from where the 
suspect, Roy J. Coker, was surrounded on Oct. 27, 1984, sued the Sheriff's 
Department after Coker suddenly began firing shots from his office window, 
killing a woman and seriously injuring a man. 
</P>
<P>
Victim Mark Luna, 45, testified during the three-week civil trial that deputies 
would not tell him what they were doing in the neighborhood, but that they did 
say it was safe for him to walk across the complex's courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Luna was shot in the elbow when he walked into the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Flory Manzano, 48, heard Luna's screams and opened the door to her 
apartment after he was shot, witnesses testified. Coker shot and killed her 
when she entered his line of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies testified during the trial that they do not recall Luna's 
ever asking whether the courtyard area was safe. They said they did not 
evacuate the area in front of Coker's window because they did not know he was 
armed. 
</P>
<P>
Coker, who made video and audiotapes of much of the standoff that were played 
back during the trial, was killed when deputies stormed his office. 
</P>
<P>
"Jurors indicated to us that they felt that the sheriffs were doing the best 
job they could," Anthony Nicklin, principal county counsel, said. "The 
plaintiffs were wonderful people, and it's a sad day when you have injured 
people who don't receive any compensation . . . but, overall, the jury felt we 
did all that we were required to do." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Julius, who represented Luna and Manzano's relatives, said he 
intends to appeal the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Two detectives allowed my client to go into an area that they knew was unsafe 
and they didn't tell anyone what was going on," Julius said. "Essentially, you 
had two civilians testifying to one thing and deputy sheriffs testifying to 
another and the jury chose to believe the deputies."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY TO ACQUIRE MUFFLER SHOP PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance city officials are taking steps to acquire the land occupied by Aable 
Muffler Center in the city's old downtown, despite protests from its owner, 
Walter J. (Jake) Egan, that the city is acting to please the neighboring 
American Honda Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
The aging muffler shop is at Torrance Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue, in front 
of the new $225-million Honda headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted 7 to 0 Tuesday to approve the city's 
acquisition of the muffler shop land through eminent domain. Next, the city 
will file a lawsuit to condemn the property, said City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they need the land as part of a project to widen Torrance 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to resolve what's considered an unsafe curve," said City Manager LeRoy 
Jackson. "You need the north side of the street in order to accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
Egan's lawyer, Kurt D. Bridgman, said: "Mr. Egan's shop is right in front of 
the centerpiece of Torrance's redevelopment project, the Honda Center. Mr. 
Egan's property is in great contrast to that center." 
</P>
<P>
"We have offered him several different locations, and he's turned them down," 
said City Councilman Timothy Mock. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the city offered Egan $87,000 for the muffler shop and land, but 
he rejected the offer, saying the property is worth at least $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now the value will be determined by the court as part of the condemnation 
proceedings, Mayor Katy Geissert said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERY SUSPECT HELD AFTER POLICE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected robber was arrested Wednesday after a car chase with police ended 
when his car crashed into a fire hydrant and a light pole in North Hollywood, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Raymond Rueda said the suspect, Yoon Hong, 18, of Rialto, suffered 
minor injuries in the 1:15 a.m. crash at Vineland Avenue and Bluffside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being held in lieu of $20,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Police said officers on routine patrol came upon a street robbery in progress 
about 1 a.m. near Silver Lake and Sunset boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The officers saw three young men robbing a fourth man; the robbers ran in 
different directions when they saw the police car, Rueda said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men ran to a car and sped north on the Hollywood Freeway with the 
patrol car in pursuit. The vehicle left the freeway at Vineland Avenue and the 
driver turned the vehicle's headlights off, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The car went out of control at Bluffside Drive and struck the fire hydrant and 
light pole. 
</P>
<P>
Hong was treated at the scene by paramedics and was being held at the Northeast 
Station jail, police said. Police were still looking for the other two men. The 
name of the victim was not released.

Four vehicles collided in North Hollywood, killing a motorcyclist and injuring 
his passenger as they hurried to a hospital because the passenger's wife had 
just given birth, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Brian Belafsky, 34, of North Hollywood was killed when he was 
thrown from his motorcycle Tuesday at Victory Boulevard and Riverton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
His passenger, Ray Alarid, 22, of North Hollywood was slightly injured. There 
were no other injuries in the accident that closed the intersection for nearly 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Belafsky was heading east shortly after 3 p.m. when he tried to pass a car that 
was in the left-turn lane, Detective Wayne Duford said. The car turned and 
sideswiped the motorcycle, sending it out of control into two westbound cars 
stopped at a traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
Belafsky was thrown 20 feet and killed instantly. Alarid was also thrown from 
the motorcycle. He was taken by helicopter to Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills, where he was treated for scratches and bruises and released. 
Neither of the victims was wearing a helmet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Alarid said the two were speeding on the motorcycle because his wife had just 
delivered a baby at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, police said.

COMPUTER FILE: GEOWORKS GETS A LOT MORE FROM LESS POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
GeoWorks, a 50-person software company based in Berkeley, is about to release 
GeoWorks Ensemble, a set of programs and an exciting new graphical user 
interface for IBM PCs and compatibles. The product, which will be unveiled this 
evening in Boston, should be available in November. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its modest hardware requirements, GeoWorks will be of particular 
interest to people with older machines as well as budget-minded computer 
shoppers who are looking for an easy-to-use environment that runs on low-cost 
equipment. The product is aimed at the home and small-business market. But even 
users of more powerful machines will appreciate GeoWorks' simplicity, speed and 
excellent graphics. 
</P>
<P>
In general, GeoWorks is similar to what is already available on the Apple 
Macintosh or on IBM compatibles running Microsoft Windows. You start programs 
by using a mouse to click on their icons, or pictures. Commands are issued via 
pull-down menus. You use the mouse to select text or graphics to be copied, 
deleted or moved. And data can be easily moved from one program to another. 
What's more, it's possible to run more than one program at a time, each in its 
own window and switch from program to program with a click of the mouse. 
GeoWorks will have a suggested retail price of $195. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Windows, GeoWorks works on virtually any IBM PC as long as it has a hard 
disk, a graphic display and at least 512 kilobytes of memory. Windows requires 
a PC with at least 1 megabyte of memory and an Intel 286, 386 or 486 central 
processing unit. As a result, most machines in use today are not able to run 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
My only complaint about GeoWorks is that it doesn't allow you to create macros, 
which allow you to assign your own series of keystrokes to commands. GeoWorks 
plans to add a macro feature to a future version. 
</P>
<P>
GeoWorks starts off with a "Welcome" screen with three icons. A click on the 
Appliances icon takes you to an area where you can use any of four basic and 
easy-to-use programs: a calculator, an address book, a personal 
calendar/planner and a note pad. The Professional icon takes you to the 
GeoManager, with icons for eight additional programs: word processing, 
computer-to-computer communications, drawing, personal calendar, address book, 
note pad, calculator and a program to connect with America Online, an 
easy-to-use on-line information service. It's also where you perform routine 
file maintenance such as copying, deleting and moving files or creating 
directories. 
</P>
<P>
The final icon on the Welcome screen takes you to an area where you can start 
regular MS-DOS programs that do not use the GeoWorks interface. 
</P>
<P>
GeoWorks' word processing program, called GeoWrite, is both easy to use and 
sophisticated. It compares favorably to stand-alone word-processing programs 
that sell for more than twice the cost of the entire GeoWorks package. As with 
all GeoWorks programs, its typefaces can be displayed or printed at any size. 
</P>
<P>
The "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) environment displays your margins, 
headers, footers and page breaks. GeoWrite supports color and multiple columns 
on screen. You can create and store paragraph styles and ruler settings for use 
on subsequent documents. 
</P>
<P>
Text editing is similar to what you'll find on Macintosh and Windows 
word-processing programs. To modify text, you select it with the mouse and 
perform an operation such as copying it to the clipboard, deleting it or 
changing its appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing program, called GeoDraw, is also reasonably sophisticated. You can 
use it to draw lines, circles, rectangles and other shapes in black and white 
or color. Any graphic created in GeoDraw can be pasted into GeoWrite or any 
other GeoWorks application. Drawing programs, unlike painting programs, allow 
you to create and manipulate objects so that any portion can be resized, 
deleted or moved without affecting other parts. 
</P>
<P>
The communications program, called GeoComm, is pretty basic but it's good 
enough for most users who want to sign on to an on-line service such as 
CompuServe, GEnie or MCI Mail. Another GeoWorks program is designed to sign on 
to America Online, which provides news, information, electronic mail and other 
services. America Online costs $5.95 a month plus a minimum of $5 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
GeoPlanner, the personal calendar program, and GeoDex, which stores phone 
numbers and addresses, are very basic and easy to use. The two programs can 
work together to both look up a person's number and dial the telephone if your 
PC is equipped with a modem. 
</P>
<P>
The company, according to its president, Brian Dougherty, is encouraging other 
software companies to develop additional GeoWorks programs, including a 
spreadsheet and database management system. 
</P>
<P>
GeoWorks is located at 2125 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, Calif. 94704. Phone: (415) 
644-0883.

DOW FALLS 15.84 TO CLOSE AT 2,489 IN SLOW TRADING 
</P>

<P>
Rising oil prices combined with computer-driven sell programs and economic 
worries to send stocks lower Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 15.84 points to 2,489.36 in thin trading. 
Most of the losses came in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume declined to 135.5 million shares, the lowest since Sept. 17 
and significantly down from Tuesday's 188.3 million shares. In the broader 
market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 564 up, 972 down and 437 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Most broader indexes finished with greater losses than the Dow. The Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500 index slumped 1.2%, losing 3.81 points to 311.40. 
</P>
<P>
A key factor in the afternoon drop was the price of oil, which jumped after a 
two-day slide. Crude oil for November rose $3.37 on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange to $37.32 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Oil had a lot to do with it," said Dale Tills, manager of institutional 
equities at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. "Everything else is status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Washington added to the sense of uncertainty by sending mixed signals on the 
proposal to cut $500 billion from the federal deficit over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's praise for the budget accord gave the 
market an early boost, triggering hopes for an easing of interest rates. But 
White House and congressional leaders contradicted each other over the budget's 
prospects for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying everything was the same queasiness about the economy that has 
pervaded trading since July. September car sales figures released Wednesday 
showed buying was still relatively strong, but GM shares were hard hit on a 
particularly weak sales report. GM fell 1 5/8 to 35 3/8, sinking the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Retailers were hit by a major selloff, led by Wal-Mart, which lost 1 3/4 to 
27 3/4. Some analysts have been saying the stock is overpriced. Other major 
casualties included J.C. Penney, off 1 1/2 to 42 3/4; Sears, off 1 1/8 to 25 
3/8; Home Depot, down 1 1/2 to 31 1/4; and Dillard Department Stores, down 5 to 
75 1/4. A growing number of analysts fear consumer spending will soon dry up 
because of economic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
* The high-tech sector also suffered big losses. Apple Computer dropped 2 5/8 
to 27, or 9%, after announcing plans for lower-than-expected prices on three 
personal computers it is introducing this month. Also dragged down were Sun 
Microsystems, down 2 3/4 to 19 1/2; Autodesk, off 2 3/4 to 37; Sequent, down 1 
3/4 to 14 1/4; and Intel, off 1 1/4 to 33 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Bally Manufacturing tumbled 3/8 to 3 3/4 on continuing fears that the 
gambling firm is in financial trouble. Elsewhere, Golden Nugget fell 5/8 to 20 
5/8 and Circus Circus lost 1 3/4 to 44 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Continental Bank slipped 1/4 to 9 1/8 despite news that a group led by 
investor Laurence A. Tisch has raised its stake to 8.5% from 5.6%. Most 
financial stocks continued to slump. Ahmanson lost 7/8 to 13 3/4, Broad Inc. 
dropped 1/4 to 5, First Interstate fell 1 to 20 5/8 and Chase Manhattan lost 
5/8 to 11 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, after a spectacular one-day jump of 2,676.55, or 13.24%, 
that breathed life into Tokyo's bearish market, shares fell back slightly 
Wednesday, and some analysts said prices had yet to reach bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei index fell 49.02 points, ending the day at 22,849.39 in 
moderate trading. At mid-morning today the Nikkei was off another 506.57 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed higher on London's exchange on speculation that the pound's 
entry into Europe's exchange rate mechanism was imminent. The Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 28.5 points at 2,087.0. 
</P>
<P>
The German market was closed for the unification day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds Close Lower on Inflation Fears 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices closed mostly lower as the surge in oil prices reignited fears 
about inflation and caused new concern that interest rates won't fall much. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32 point, or about $4.68 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to 
8.87% from 8.82% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight 
loans, was quoted at 9%, up from 8.25% late Tuesday. However, technical 
aberrations often cloud rate trends on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Drops on All Major Markets 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined on world currency markets as traders continued to bet that 
U.S. interest rates are poised to move lower. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Marc Chandler, an analyst at the consulting firm IDEA, noted that the 
dollar did not pierce "the bottom of a broad trading range." 
</P>
<P>
Trading was relatively light, which exacerbated the currency's move downward. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at 1.542 German marks, down from Tuesday's close of 1.549. 
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar ended at 136.04, down from 136.72 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Early today in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a record low of 1.538 German marks. It 
also fell to 135.88 yen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gold, Oil Futures Stage Sharp Gains 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices rose sharply and oil futures soared in moves that analysts 
said were inspired more by technical factors than developments in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, copper futures rallied, and grains and soybeans 
were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures for October settled $4.80 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, 
at $393.90 an ounce. Gold had risen $2.50 on Tuesday. October silver rose 1.1 
cents to $4.69 after gaining 3.9 cents on Tuesday.

LEGAL VIEW: IT'S WISE TO DO ALL ESTATE PLANNING EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Estate planning is an often overlooked obligation that if neglected can wreak 
havoc with family members left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas E. Stindt, a Woodland Hills lawyer and frequent correspondent to Legal 
View, shared his frustration about several neglectful clients in a letter 
earlier this year: 
</P>
<P>
"The accumulation of property over a lifetime of work and saving, and the 
growth of investments or a family business all involve a responsibility, and it 
is one which is frequently overlooked. That responsibility is to a spouse, 
partner, child or close relative, and it is a responsibility to not leave for 
someone else to sort through and straighten out an entangled mess of jumbled 
titles, property holdings, and half-completed transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do people of substantial accomplishment wait until a spouse is unable to 
sign deeds or even give medical consents or instructions, then feel unfairly 
put upon by the system?" he wrote. "A health care power, a trust, a durable 
power, any number of (legal) devices could save family members thousands of 
dollars of expense and weeks of delay." 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't have said it better. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in any estate planning is to thoroughly understand your own 
financial situation and the available legal options, many of which have been 
mentioned in this column in the past. That may require some time and effort on 
your part. Buying one of the many good books available on estate planning and 
talking to friends who have already consulted estate planning lawyers are good 
initial steps. If your estate is simple, you may find the fill-in-the-blanks 
will form described in last week's column best for you. 
</P>
<P>
However, depending upon the complexity of your financial position, you may need 
personalized legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But be a smart legal consumer. Come prepared. Understand what your lawyer is 
talking about when he or she refers to a trust, a durable power or a health 
care power. 
</P>
<P>
To start you on your way, let me explain briefly a few of the devices Stindt 
mentioned. The durable power of attorney allows you to appoint someone else to 
handle your financial affairs, even if you become incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
This allows you to avoid the expense and inconvenience of a court 
conservatorship proceeding. The court won't have to select someone to act on 
your behalf, because you will have already done so. "The Power of Attorney 
Book," written by Denis Clifford and published by Nolo Press, includes tear-out 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
A separate issue from your financial affairs is health care decisions. Who 
makes them if you are incapacitated? 
</P>
<P>
There is another legal document, called a durable power of attorney for health 
care, that allows you to designate a person as your agent to make decisions 
about surgical procedures, life support equipment and other health care choices 
that you are unable to make. 
</P>
<P>
The California Medical Assn. has published a form and explanatory booklet. For 
a copy, send $1.50 plus area sales tax to Sutter Publications, P. O. Box 7690, 
San Francisco, 94120-7690, telephone (415) 882-5175. 
</P>
<P>
One other planning option Stindt mentioned is a trust. The most common one is 
known as a living trust. A trust is a legal entity into which you can transfer 
your assets. 
</P>
<P>
The trust owns the assets, not you, but you control the trust by appointing 
yourself as trustee. After your death, the person you select as the successor 
trustee takes over control of the trust, and follows your instructions in the 
trust document. You avoid probate, but trusts are not a panacea. They don't 
save taxes, and they do require paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
One problem Stindt has noticed with clients who have established living trusts 
is that they forget to fund them. It's not enough to create a trust document, 
which is commonly done by an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Then you must make sure that you or your lawyer complete the paperwork to make 
the trust the legal owner of your property, for example, by changing the title 
to your home or bank accounts to reflect the trust ownership. If you don't do 
that, the property won't be subject to the instructions in your trust and will 
be subject to probate. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if property is listed as owned by two joint tenants, it won't 
matter what the trust says, the surviving joint tenant will inherit the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"If Uncle Mort is to get his brother's half interest in the deli," explains 
Stindt, "and is relying on the trust which says so to make this happen, it 
won't work out that way if the brother and his wife hold title to the deli as 
joint tenants." 
</P>
<P>
And Uncle Mort wouldn't be too happy.

ERMA BOMBECK: EMPTY NEST GETS FAST REDECORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time sociologists had us believing that the "empty nest" was like 
some dreaded, uncontrollable disease, symptomatized by crying, long periods of 
depression and an inability to function. 
</P>
<P>
We'd hear stories about mothers who converted their grown children's rooms into 
shrines and fathers who called up their married sons and begged them to "come 
over and shoot a few baskets after dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors circulated that mothers automatically set the table for three for the 
rest of their lives and dads gave up their bowling nights for fear they'd miss 
a call from the "kid." 
</P>
<P>
In my mind, I put the empty nest right up there with menopause and gingivitis. 
</P>
<P>
When our last child left home, a friend called and said, "You need company to 
get you through the first night alone?" 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," I said, "you caught us as we were leaving. We're going out to 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have to face that empty house sometime," she warned. 
</P>
<P>
She was right. We filled in all the small holes left by darts and nails and had 
his room painted and made into a small TV room. We had the rugs cleaned and the 
oil spots removed from the driveway. After that, we went on our first vacation 
that wasn't planned around a paper route. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying there weren't adjustments. It was weeks before we stopped 
looking for the TV tuner in the bathroom, months before our hearing returned to 
normal, and I still haven't gotten over the shock of going into the garage and 
seeing my own car parked there. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, we have learned to live with phones that ring only when they're 
for us, two loads of laundry a week and popcorn for dinner. Our friends marvel 
at how well we are able to deal with the trauma of just the two of us entering 
the twilight years alone. They say we are very brave. We smile and say, "Thank 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Recently the University of Nebraska researched the empty-nest syndrome and 
discovered that when children leave home, the marriage of the parents not only 
improves, but that they may even experience a mini-honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
Some say this change of attitude is due to the independence of women who go 
from child raising to a second career that is just as fulfilling. I say there 
was a whole generation of parents who were lying to us through their teeth just 
to keep the prophecy alive.

MORNING REPORT: 'MISS DAISY' STILL BARRELING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DENNIS HUNT , Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press.

<TEXT>
<P>
When is "Driving Miss Daisy" going to run out of gas? The makers of the movies 
that have been vainly chasing "Miss Daisy" on the Billboard magazine rental 
chart since August would love to know. They'd like a chance to rule the rental 
chart, but none have had enough drawing power to unseat the queen -- "Miss 
Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth of July," which has No. 1 potential, is still trailing in 
the No. 2 spot. The question is, will "Born" run out of steam before "Miss 
Daisy" runs out of gas? Tune in next week. Disney's "Peter Pan" flitted onto 
the rental chart at No. 17. But, retailing for $24.99 and often discounted down 
around $15, "Peter Pan" will do much better in the sales market. 
</P>
<P>
* "Born on the Fourth of July" hasn't had any luck driving "Miss Daisy" out of 
the top spot, but another kind of war movie might just do it. "Glory," which is 
about a black regiment in the Civil War, entered the chart at No. 6. Because 
the PBS "Civil War" TV series did so well last week, there's probably 
heightened interest among many renters in an acclaimed movie dealing with that 
war.

LAST SUNSET FOR THE SAND AND SEA CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a day for memories: old friends recalling seemingly endless summers. 
Many members had grown up there; some had even fallen in love. And so they 
gathered one last time, knowing that when the day ended Sunday, a place they 
treasured would be no more. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday looked like any other day at the Sand and Sea Club in Santa Monica. 
People were playing paddle tennis, swimming in the pool, playing volleyball or 
gin rummy. Children were noisily playing in a sandy playground nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not an ordinary day. It was the last day the 30-year-old Sand and 
Sea Club would operate as a private beach club. 
</P>
<P>
"An era has come to an end," said Doug Badt, who had operated the club since 
1960. "You accept it." 
</P>
<P>
City officials evicted the club from the state-owned 4.9-acre parcel at 415 
Pacific Coast Highway to make way for what they hope will be a luxury hotel and 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than a tearful event, the last day provided more than 1,000 visitors 
with a chance to once more enjoy what has been a second home for some of them. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's farewell was one of the largest turnouts at the club, said Mary Lee 
Gowland, who had been office manager since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a graduation party," she said. "There was so much loving and 
warmth. I've never seen so much kissing and hugging. It was like a big family." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a group who had grown up together at the club sat at a table 
reminiscing about the past 30 years. Some members had met their spouses there 
and then continued a tradition by bringing their own children. Others talked of 
trying to meet new people at the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a friend wanted to introduce me to a guy at the club," said Shelly 
Wissot, 39. "When she pointed him out, it was a guy I grew up with at the club 
and had known for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Wissot pulled out a 20-year-old volleyball schedule she had found when cleaning 
out her locker. The people in the group looked over the names, most of them 
still members, and shouted out those that brought back memories. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality that this was the last day of the club eventually sank in. 
</P>
<P>
"Being able to grow up here is something really special," said Michael Roth, 
29, whose parents first took him there as an infant. "It's kind of sad that I 
won't ever be able to bring my kids here." 
</P>
<P>
The city closed the club, although voters will not decide on the hotel project 
until the Nov. 6 city election, because officials said it was inappropriate to 
have a private club on public land. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday many members said they never felt like their club was private, 
saying no one was denied membership because of race, color or religion. Some 
said they favored converting the club to a public facility. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about friendships; you're talking about an environment," said 
Meg Freeman, 31. "Why should that be termed elitist? You're talking about 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"I figure that 75% of my life has been spent here," said Rick Gold, 38, a 
longtime member who met his wife at the club. "I've never thought of this as a 
private club. Anyone could join." 
</P>
<P>
The property was originally developed in 1929 as a private estate for actress 
Marion Davies by publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. The 60-room Ocean 
House, demolished in 1957, included a dining room for 25 guests, 37 fireplaces 
and a room finished in gold leaf. 
</P>
<P>
The area around the estate was known as the The Gold Coast and was noted for 
extravagant beach houses and beach clubs that flanked the west side of Pacific 
Coast Highway, as well as the Hollywood celebrities who frequented them. 
</P>
<P>
The Davies estate was purchased in 1945 by a private party and converted to a 
hotel and beach club. It was not very successful, and in 1959, the state 
acquired the property and granted management responsibility to the city of 
Santa Monica under a long-term operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1960, the property has been leased by the Sand and Sea Club for $250,000 
a year, which went to the city for beach cleanup. Improvements since then 
include a public beach restroom at the northwest corner of the site, a 
176-space public beach parking lot at the south end and a small food concession 
stand and banquet room at the southwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
On the northern portion of the site is a rectangular two-story house called the 
North House, one of only two remaining original structures. The North House 
consists of wood-frame construction in the architectural style called 
"millionaire's colonial," a grandiose version of neoclassical. The exterior is 
white clapboard with a pillared portico, flanking wings and a gabled roof. 
</P>
<P>
The 110-foot-by-33-foot swimming pool, another important survivor of the Davies 
estate, is made in part of Italian marble. 
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, only the North House would be saved and incorporated into 
the hotel and community center proposed by restaurateur Michael McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
John Lynd, the city's acting director of cultural and recreational services, 
said the city took possession of the property on Monday, and it has posted a 
24-hour guard. 
</P>
<P>
Lynd said city officials will assess what needs to be done to reopen some of 
the facilities for public use, particularly the paddle tennis courts, the 
swimming pool and the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county Health Department has closed the swimming pool because of an 
inadequate filtration system. However, he said he hopes all three facilities 
can reopen for public use within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, members tried to enjoy their last day. Even some former 
employees returned for one last memory. 
</P>
<P>
Hattie Pinson, 73, retired four years ago after working for 33 years as manager 
of the women's locker room. Pinson was there Sunday, stopping every few minutes 
to hug another person whom she had not seen for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I know them all," said Pinson, adding that she missed church on Sunday to 
revisit the facility and friends. "I knew those young men over there when their 
mothers would bring them into the women's locker room. But only till they were 
5 years old, then they had to go to the men's locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really sad," Pinson said, then paused for a moment. With a slight 
smile, she continued: "You know, they gave me a lifetime membership when I 
retired. I really hadn't used it, but I thought I better start using it today."

HEARING ON PARK LABREA FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hearing has been set on an appeal of the city's rejection of a Park Labrea 
proposal to charge tenants for the more than $3-million cost of fencing and 
gating the 10,000-resident apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Rent Stabilization Division of the Los Angeles Community 
Development Department said the hearing, previously scheduled for Sept. 28, was 
postponed at the request of the Park Labrea management. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be held Nov. 16 at 9 a.m. in the Rent Adjustment Commission's 
eighth-floor hearing room, at 215 W. 6th St. 
</P>
<P>
In its decision, which was handed down in May, the Rent Stabilization Division 
found that Forest City Management Co. did not provide enough information to 
justify the proposed rent increases and found that the fencing and gating 
system was not yet operating when the application was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Forest City, which operates Park Labrea and also owns a half-interest in the 
4,200-unit complex, submitted its application for a rent increase on Sept. 25 
of last year, hoping to be allowed to charge tenants $12.09 a month in 
perpetuity to defray the cost of the $3,054,588 security system. 
</P>
<P>
Revised rules that went into effect Oct. 1 would allow an increase of $6.05 a 
month over a six-year period.

PROBE OF NON-KOSHER MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office has charged a Fairfax Avenue butcher shop 
with selling non-kosher turkey as kosher. 
</P>
<P>
The civil action, which carries possible penalties of $2,500 or more, alleges 
that Bazar Meats also failed to keep the paperwork required for butcher shops 
to prove that their stock of fresh meat comes from kosher suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
David Levi, who was named in the complaint, denied the charge, saying he had 
just taken over the operation and was not yet in business when county 
investigators seized a case of turkeys two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bazar Meats is inside Bazar Market, a separate enterprise where Levi worked 
before taking over the meat counter on his own, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to go to court, and the landlord will testify that the box wasn't 
mine," Levi said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Herschel Elkins, who filed the complaint after an 
investigation by agents of the Los Angeles County Department of Weights and 
Measures, said the defendant has 30 days to respond to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't alleged any complaints at this time against Bazar Market," he said.

LOYOLA CAR-POOLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 of nearly 800 faculty and staff members at Loyola Marymount 
University are leaving their cars at home and car pooling to work to save 
energy and reduce pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Hilyar, the school's director of public safety, said car pooling was 
organized at the school in response to Air Quality Management District 
regulations aimed at reducing car travel. 
</P>
<P>
Employees who participate in the program are given choice campus parking spots 
and free parking permits. In addition, participants are provided free 
transportation in cases of emergency.

OPEN HOUSE IS MORE THAN JUST ASKING: 'HOW'S JOEY DOING?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY YARBER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the next few weeks, thousands of Westside parents will take part in a 
classic autumn ritual: open house at their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Open houses give parents the chance to sit in the room where their children 
spend roughly 900 hours a year in grade school, and 180 hours a year in junior 
and senior high school. It is also an opportunity to meet the teacher, who in 
most cases spends more time with a child each day than the parents do. 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways for parents to make the most of the open house at their 
child's school. There's more to it than simply asking, "How's my kid doing in 
class?" 
</P>
<P>
Ask the teacher for a list of topics that are covered in class so that you know 
exactly which novels, historical periods and mathematical or scientific 
concepts your child is learning. Instead of always asking your child, "What did 
you do in school today?" you can monitor his or her knowledge on specific 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Ask for a copy of the grading policy to learn the kinds of assignments given, 
which ones count most heavily toward the final grade and the extra-credit 
options that are offered. 
</P>
<P>
Also find out how often report cards are given; many parents are surprised to 
learn that grades are published at most Westside schools every six or eight 
weeks, not just twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
The grading policy should mention how often homework is assigned in an average 
week; if not, be sure to ask the teacher. That way you'll know better if your 
student constantly comes home without books and says there was nothing 
assigned. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to finding out the basic requirements of a class, also ask about 
the extras. Is there, for example, a museum exhibit or television program that 
would enhance and enliven a topic that your child is now studying in class? Are 
there related magazines that he or she can read in the school library? If your 
child is reading novels or plays, is there a videotape available for watching 
at home? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, teachers usually don't have enough time to talk at length with 
parents during the open house because the visitors are herded through too 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But there's still an easy way to reserve some quality time with your child's 
teachers. Bring to the open house a note for each teacher that lists your phone 
number at home and work, and the best time to reach you. List specific 
questions or concerns you would like to discuss. Make sure you give the 
student's last name if it's different from yours. 
</P>
<P>
As you give the note to the teacher, ask when you can expect to hear from him 
or her. Asking "Will I hear from you by Friday?" helps to ensure that you will. 
</P>
<P>
What you see at the open house may tell you as much about your child's school 
life as what you hear, so explore the classroom thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Wall displays, maps, showcases of student work and a seating arrangement that 
allows students to interact usually mean that the teacher inspires curiosity 
and open discussion of ideas. Remember, though, that not all teachers -- no 
matter how inspiring -- have wall space, floor space or funding to jazz up 
their classrooms this way. 
</P>
<P>
Make time to venture beyond the classroom, too. Visit the office to read 
notices of school activities and meet your child's counselor, or inspect the 
safety and versatility of the gym or playground. Getting a school newspaper 
will also tell you a lot about the school's inner workings. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, remember that examination of your child's academic world need not be 
limited to the open house. It is your right to visit a public school on any 
school day, and many teachers encourage parents to schedule visits to actual 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
If your work schedule makes a daytime back-to-school visit impossible, then 
making the most of an open house is the best alternative.

PROSTITUTION CHARGED AT 2 MASSAGE PARLORS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS LEAD TO ARRESTS OF EMPLOYEES AT 
ESTABLISHMENTS ON GOWER STREET AND MELROSE AVENUE. CHARGES FILED AGAINST 
OWNERS.

<P>
City Atty. James Hahn has filed both criminal and civil actions against the 
operators of two massage parlors in the Westside, which he described as 
"nothing but fronts for prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
Named in the two criminal complaints and one civil lawsuit filed late last 
Friday by the city are Calabasas residents Yu Ron Chung, 42, and his wife, 
Kyung Hwi Chung, 41, Hahn said. He said the two operate a massage parlor at 
5916 Melrose Ave., known as the Kiku Studio, and another at 867 N. Gower St., 
which bears the sign, Oriental Spa. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department undercover operations at the Kiku Studio have led 
to the arrests of more than 12 massage technicians on prostitution charges, 
Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Vice officers who have posed as massage customers at the two establishments 
over the past few years have been routinely offered sex for money, said Deputy 
City Atty. Michael Guarino, who handles criminal prosecutions of houses of 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
He said undercover officers also have observed massage technicians nude with 
customers, and on one occasion at the Kiku Studio, officers found a technician 
in the act of having sex with a customer in a massage room, Guarino said. The 
customer later admitted to paying $80 for the service, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
"The history of these businesses makes it very evident that regardless of what 
the signs out front may say," Hahn said, "they are nothing but fronts for 
prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
The Chungs could not be reached for comment, and their lawyer did not return 
phone calls Wednesday. No one responded to knocks at the doors of both massage 
parlors late Tuesday, and the Kiku Studio had a "closed" sign out front. 
</P>
<P>
But Guarino said both parlors are continuing to do business. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the parlor on Gower Street, Hahn has charged the Chungs with a 
criminal violation of the city's Adult Entertainment Ordinance, which makes it 
a crime punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine to operate 
an adult business within 500 feet of a residential area, school, religious 
institution or public park. Guarino said the parlor, across the street from 
Paramount Studios, is next to a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Melrose Avenue parlor, which is next to a preschool, the 
Chungs are criminally charged with one count each of using the business for 
purposes of prostitution. As a result, they are also charged with creating a 
public nuisance. Each count carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail 
and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The city also is trying to close the Gower Street parlor through civil action 
under the California Red Light Abatement Act, which would allow the city to get 
a court injunction setting strict conditions on the business while efforts 
continue to close it permanently. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are prevented from taking action to shut down the Kiku Studio under 
the abatement act because the Chungs have received a temporary exemption from 
its provisions due to economic hardship, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chungs are set for arraignment on the criminal charges Oct. 24, Guarino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another deputy city attorney, Henry Burr, is handling the civil lawsuit and is 
in the process of seeking a hearing date for a preliminary injunction, Burr 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the criminal and civil actions, the Los Angeles Police 
Commission has initiated proceedings to revoke the massage parlor permits held 
by both establishments, Guarino said. He said the permit for Kiku Studio was 
suspended previously, for 15 days in 1986, after inspectors found numerous 
violations of Police Commission rules regulating the operation of massage 
parlors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are ongoing investigations into several other massage parlors 
in the Westside and other parts of the city, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are assumptions by vice officers that there are other massage parlors at 
which some serious prostitution is going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guarino said he could not release any details of the investigations because 
authorities are working undercover, and no charges have been filed against the 
locations.

L.A. COUNCIL BALKS AT FRYMAN CANYON PURCHASE; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: YAROSLAVSKY SAYS A $1.96-MILLION CITY CONTRIBUTION COULD ABORT 2 
WESTSIDE SITE ACQUISITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council delayed a vote Tuesday on a proposal to spend 
$1.96 million to help buy Fryman Canyon for parkland after Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky expressed concern that the high price might jeopardize other park 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said there are two possible park sites in his Westside district -- 
one near Fossil Ridge and the other in Benedict Canyon -- that might not be 
acquired if the money is spent on the Fryman Canyon purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to delay a vote until Nov. 7 came on the recommendation of 
Councilman Michael Woo, whose district includes the steep and heavily wooded 
canyon where property owner Fred Sahadi has proposed building 26 luxury houses. 
</P>
<P>
Woo told colleagues there was no need to allocate the money as long as the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state park agency, is studying whether to 
participate in a plan, devised by Woo and Mayor Tom Bradley, to buy the 63-acre 
canyon for $10.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley-Woo plan called for the conservancy to put up $8.7 million, the 
city to contribute $1.96 million and private parties to provide $250,000 in 
charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy board of directors on Monday reaffirmed its "historic interest" 
in buying Fryman Canyon but refused to approve the Bradley-Woo plan until it 
checked with the state attorney general's office and the state Department of 
General Services about the terms. The conservancy board gave itself a Nov. 5 
deadline to reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has been reluctant to participate in a deal to buy the canyon 
if the total price is more than $8.7 million -- a valuation once agreed upon as 
fair by state officials. Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston has 
expressed concerns about paying $10.9 million when his agency does not have a 
state-approved appraisal justifying the price. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the deal also began to surface on the council floor Tuesday. 
Yaroslavsky warned his colleagues that if too much is paid for Fryman Canyon, 
other worthwhile Santa Monica Mountains parkland purchases "would be blown out 
the window." The per-acre price would be among the highest in the history of 
the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now you haven't heard from other quarters," Yaroslavsky said. "But 
this decision may have an impact on other projects and we need to minimize 
that. There are major acquisitions that are much cheaper than this one. I don't 
think the people want to pay a developer more for his property than it's 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
Woo, in a testy reply, said: "I am not proposing to pay the developer more than 
it's worth." The councilman also pledged to work with other council members to 
be "sensitive to parks projects in your districts." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's concerns echoed those of Joyce Coleman, a top Sierra Club 
official, who objected to any conservancy attempt "to raid funds set aside to 
protect and expand Solstice Canyon Park" in Malibu. For it to pay $8.7 million 
for Fryman Canyon would require the conservancy to drop other acquisition 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to set Nov. 7 as the next date for taking up the question of 
spending the $1.96 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the council voted 6 to 5 to reject a plan to make half of Fryman 
Canyon a cultural-historic landmark. Opponents of the housing development 
originally sought landmark status as a means to preserve the land. But in 
recent months, that proposal had taken a back seat to a plan to acquire the 
Studio City site as a park.

NO INDICTMENTS OVER INMATE'S CHOKING DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
JAILS: FEDERAL DECISION FOLLOWS COUNTY REVIEWS THAT CLEARED THE SIX DEPUTIES 
INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have decided not to indict six San Diego County deputy 
sheriffs involved in the choking death of a jail inmate, a lawyer for the man's 
family said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lengthy investigation into the January, 1988, death of Albert Varela, 
28, who was choked in a fight with deputies at the County Jail downtown, 
prosecutors have opted against pursuing criminal charges against the six 
deputies, attorney J. Manuel (Manny) Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation follows earlier reviews by the Sheriff's Department 
and county district attorney that cleared the deputies of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Varela's death was among the first in a string of complaints in 1988 about 
beatings and abuses by sheriff's deputies in all six county jails. Last year, 
the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI decided not to pursue allegations of 
civil rights violations in 70 individual complaints of inmates being abused by 
deputies, but they continued to investigate the Varela case. 
</P>
<P>
The death also touched off sharp criticism of the Sheriff's Department by 
community leaders, particularly from San Diego's Latino community, where some 
rights activists charged that Latinos were being unduly abused by law 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
Varela's father, Cruz Varela, 64, of Lakeside, a General Dynamics 
missile-building mechanic, said Wednesday he was disappointed and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's kind of political," he said. "We're small people down here. We 
probably don't have the money, that's the main thing, to put in the right 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"That seems to be the whole thing, I hear," Varela said. "If you've got money, 
your name sits up there high, they sit up and listen to you. But we happen to 
be a minority. That didn't help our cause very much. I definitely don't feel we 
got a fair shake" in the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
Court records identify the six deputies as Roy DeVault (who has since left the 
department to attend college), Carlos Rodriguez, Jon Ellis, Ronald K. Brown, J. 
J. Rodi and S. T. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Varela was arrested Jan. 22, 1988, after he allegedly violated a court 
order to stay away from his family because of past temper tantrums. When police 
arrived, he asked to be taken to the downtown jail. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district attorney's investigation, a fight broke out while 
Varela was being booked. The fight began when Rodriguez "threw Varela's clothes 
to him, and Varela, in turn, threw them at Deputy Rodriguez." 
</P>
<P>
A fight ensued, and the five other deputies tried to help Rodriguez subdue 
Varela, who was 6-foot-1 and weighed 286 pounds. DeVault applied a carotid 
restraint hold on Varela's neck while the other inmates kept him off balance, 
the district attorney found, and Varela eventually fell face down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
With blood coming out of his nose, Varela was handcuffed and dragged by his 
legs -- with his chin scraping the floor -- and placed inside a padded safety 
cell, where his vital signs were examined and found to be weak, the district 
attorney said. He was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
The formal announcement of the federal investigation's result is contained in a 
letter that Sanchez said was in the mail. He said government sources told him 
Wednesday that the letter indicates there will be no federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"Every indication up to now has been that the facts and evidence were clear -- 
that the violation of this man's civil rights, the result of his death, was 
criminal in nature," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It's a long time to come to this juncture, and I believe the Varela 
family is deeply affected by it. Their sense of justice is that the responsible 
persons should be made accountable for the death of their son, and are not." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez also said a decision to pursue prosecution could have sent a message: 
"If there's a message out there, it's that you've got to stop these things. 
Otherwise, the death of a guy like Varela is going to happen again. Now the 
message is, 'We can get away with it, guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
Stephen P. Clark, the assistant U.S. attorney who specializes in civil rights 
investigations and who handled the grand jury investigation in the Varela 
death, declined to comment on the case Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy could not be reached for comment. Neither could various 
lawyers involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury targeted the six deputies earlier this year. In letters mailed 
to the deputy sheriffs in April, the U.S. attorney's office -- which was 
believed to be presenting the case in May to the grand jury for possible 
indictments -- invited the deputies to testify about Varela's death. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether any of the six deputies agreed to testify. In May, it 
was believed that none of the six had come forward. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation, meanwhile, shut down action in an $8-million civil 
lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court by the Varela family against the 
deputies, Duffy and the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the deputies were invoking their constitutional 
privilege against self-incrimination in the civil case by refusing to provide 
information about Varela's death until after the federal probe had concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly two years ago, the district attorney's office declined to hold any of 
the deputies criminally liable for the death, saying Varela died when his heart 
stopped. There was "no evidence" the chokehold blocked Varela's airway, the 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
However, county prosecutors did chastise the deputies for dragging Varela 
across the floor. The civil lawsuit, which the Varela family filed in October, 
1988, alleged that the deputies were engaged in "ultra-hazardous and dangerous 
activity" when they used the carotid hold on Varela's throat. 
</P>
<P>
The case was working its way toward a trial when attorneys abruptly advised the 
court last year that the deputies did not want to take part in pretrial 
discovery, the process through which both sides exchange information about the 
case. The lawyers said the deputies feared that any information they provided 
in the suit could be used against them in the federal probe. A status hearing 
in the civil case is set for Oct. 19, court records indicate.

of Jeff Valley, a scenic area high on Palomar's slopes where the church planned 
to build its wilderness resort. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's happy," Judy Ellerby reported after disseminating the news to the 
other mountain residents via telephone. "Thank God, it's finally over." 
</P>
<P>
The staff at Palomar Observatory, 4 1/2 miles north of the church property, 
also sent up cheers. 
</P>
<P>
For five years, residents on the mountain have traveled the 60-plus miles down 
to the county Planning and Environmental Review Board hearings on the Calvary 
Chapel project, demanding that the county protect them from the influx of 
hundreds of church members seeking the mountain's solitude and, in their eyes, 
ruining the peaceful area. The church would be hosting more visitors at its 
convention center than the entire population of Palomar Mountain, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
"For once the county (Planning and Land Use Department) was on our side," Judy 
Ellerby said. Four months ago, the review board issued an ultimatum to the 
church to scale down its project -- designed to accommodate 679 guests -- and 
to change its design to protect the sensitive environment atop the mountain, or 
face denial. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the church group to submit its new plans was today but county 
planners received a letter last week from a Santa Ana architect, Robert Savage, 
formally withdrawing the application for the Palomar Mountain project. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Oberbauer, county representative on the Calvary Chapel application, said 
the review board would formally accept the church's withdrawal at its meeting 
today, without comment or hearing. The only possible glitch would be if 
Savage's letter of withdrawal had not been approved by church officials. Allen 
Haynie, Calvary Chapel's San Diego-based attorney, is expected to confirm the 
withdrawal for the county board. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Chuck Smith, senior pastor of Calvary Chapel, was away at a retreat 
Wednesday and unavailable for comment but Pastor L. E. Romaine confirmed that 
the church trustees had abandoned the rural San Diego County site and were 
hoping to close escrow this month on San Bernardino County mountain property. 
</P>
<P>
Romaine said he has not seen the Angeles National Forest site "but Pastor Smith 
and some of the trustees who have been up there are just jubilant about it." He 
added that the 552-acre Palomar Mountain property probably will be put up for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Savage, who has represented the Orange County church in its attempts to obtain 
approval to build the conference center, said that the church had abandoned the 
Palomar Mountain site "because we felt there was was a much better chance of 
obtaining the zoning we need" at the San Bernardino County site "and we didn't 
feel we were ever going to be able to build what we have in mind" on Palomar 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
When Calvary Chapel first applied for a county permit on Palomar Mountain, they 
sought to build a retreat with recreational facilities that would accommodate 
more than 1,000 guests and more than 400 cars. 
</P>
<P>
During the dozens of county hearings, many of the recreational fields and some 
of the buildings were deleted from the plans, but mountain residents still 
protested that it was not the place to build a massive church resort that would 
displace ancient oak groves and natural ponds with swimming pools and parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Ellerby said mountain residents do not fear the thought of another group 
coming in with development plans, "because they will have to play by 1990 
rules," and submit plans that meet the county's resource conservation area 
requirements, which protect the natural environment and require seismic tests 
for earthquake faults. When Calvary Chapel first applied for its Palomar 
Mountain permits, no such safeguards were in effect.

FREE DESERT FAX TAKES FAMILIES TO FRONT LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the families of hundreds of Port Hueneme-based Seabees serving in the 
Middle East, Operation Desert Fax is making America's Operation Desert Shield a 
little more bearable. 
</P>
<P>
That's Desert Fax -- as in facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
It's a program that allows families and friends to send electronically 
transmitted messages free to U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Maurer, one of the first Navy wives to use Desert Fax in Ventura County, 
travels daily with her 13-month-old daughter, Elizabeth, from their home in 
Oxnard to the AT&amp;T Phone Center in Ventura's Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
There, on a one-page form, Maurer writes a brief letter to her husband, 
Lawrence, one of 560 Port Hueneme Seabees who have been flown to the Persian 
Gulf to build airstrips and other installations. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T sends the message, by satellite, microwave or cable, to Saudi Arabia, 
where it's delivered by the military mail service within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fast," said Maurer as she composed a letter on a mall bench the other 
day. "If you use ordinary mail, it takes at least two weeks to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Since Desert Fax was launched Sept. 21, AT&amp;T has sent more than 40,000 free 
faxes to Americans in the Middle East, according to company spokeswoman Diane 
Tipton. The program, she said, was proposed by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), 
who was concerned by reports that slow mail delivery was lowering troop morale. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Crittendon, manager of the Ventura phone center, said that as of midday 
Wednesday, her store, one of 400 such units throughout the country, had 
transmitted 203 such messages. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority have been sent by Port Hueneme wives, though I think we've 
also transmitted a few to personnel from Point Mugu," she said. All Seabees 
ordered to the Middle East so far are men. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, during Maurer's second visit to the center in two days, she was 
accompanied by two other Navy wives, Colleen Schul and Heather Jaeger. Schul 
brought along her son, Lloyd Jr., 2, and daughter, Stephanie, 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
In her first fax, Maurer said, she told her husband that their daughter had 
started to walk and that his brother, Joey, had just been married. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Larry, 'We love you and we miss you,' " she added. 
</P>
<P>
All three wives said they warned their husbands to take it easy in the Middle 
Eastern heat. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard it's 125 degrees in the sun," said Jaeger, whose husband, William, 
like Lawrence Maurer and Lloyd Schul Sr., is an equipment operator with Naval 
Mobile Construction Battalion 40. "We're worried about their health." 
</P>
<P>
Maurer said she considered including a photo of herself in a tank top on one of 
her faxes, but was dissuaded by phone center personnel. "They told me the 
Saudis screen everything, and that if they saw my shoulders they'd just rip it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
But AT&amp;T's Tipton said the messages are not subject to censorship by 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Whether her letters to her husband are censored or not, Maurer vowed: "I'm 
going to send him a fax every day until he comes home." 
</P>
<P>
Tipton said AT&amp;T normally charges $3.46 to send a one-page fax message to 
the Middle East. She said the program, which is costing the company $150,000 a 
month, will be continued "at least through Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Desert Fax doesn't allow service personnel to send free messages 
home, Tipton said. She added, however, that for the next two weeks Americans 
stationed in Saudi Arabia will be able to call home without cost while AT&amp;T 
introduces its USADirect phone service in that country.

FATHER SAYS HE DIDN'T BLIND HIS INFANT SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still under investigation as the prime suspect in the blinding of his 
4-month-old son, a 21-year-old Ventura man on Wednesday denied ever hurting his 
boy and said he hopes to regain custody of him. 
</P>
<P>
Don Ray Boyd was released from Ventura County Jail late Tuesday because the 
district attorney's office did not file charges against him in the time 
required by law after his arrest. However, Sheriff's Department officials said 
Boyd is still the main suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who works for a Ventura-based hauling company, was at work Wednesday 
morning but said his mind was on his only child, Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so upset now," said Boyd, a muscular, blond man whose eyes welled up 
with tears when thinking about his child. "It makes me sick worrying about 
him." 
</P>
<P>
The baby, who turned 4 months old Tuesday, remains in critical condition at 
Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, said hospital spokeswoman Maria Iacobo. 
</P>
<P>
He has two detached retinas and will be permanently blind, Iacobo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department, which is continuing the investigation, 
said Boyd had been watching the baby for nine hours Thursday while his 
girlfriend, 20-year-old Cynthia Payne, was at work. 
</P>
<P>
When Payne returned from work at 6 p.m., she discovered that the child was 
lethargic and having problems with his eyes, said Sgt. Dee Bryce of the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department. Payne and a neighbor took the baby to Community 
Memorial Hospital in Ventura, where doctors determined that there was a 
child-abuse-related injury, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department was notified, and deputies arrested Boyd Friday at 
1:50 a.m., Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyd said he never abused the child. 
</P>
<P>
"I never harmed my little boy at all," Boyd said. "That's something uncalled 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said the baby had been sick for several days with a cold and Payne had 
been administering medication. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't acting right or even looking right" two days before the baby was 
taken to the hospital, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he was not that concerned because Payne did not seem to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
When he was baby-sitting last Thursday, he said, he thought that the child was 
unusually tired but believed that it might be due to too much medication. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my first little boy," he said. "I had no experience, no idea what was 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he grew worried because the baby continued sleeping all day. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to contact his mother and neighbors but could not reach anyone. About 
the time Payne returned home from work, the baby started having little 
seizures, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"His whole body was shaking, even his toes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Payne took the child to the hospital, telling Boyd to stay home and answer the 
phone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She later called to say doctors believed that someone had dropped or hit the 
baby, Boyd said. She called again, telling him the child was being transferred 
to Childrens Hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he did not go with Payne to see the baby in Los Angeles because her 
father, who was angry at Boyd, was driving her. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he believes that his girlfriend might have dropped the baby and not 
said anything to anyone because she did not want the baby taken away from her. 
</P>
<P>
But Detective Susan Salmon of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said that 
Boyd remains the main suspect in the case and that Payne is not a suspect at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Frawley said charges were not filed against Boyd for 
several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is still continuing to determine who might be responsible for 
inflicting injuries on the child, he said. Officials are looking into when the 
injuries may have been inflicted to determine whether the baby could have been 
hurt before Thursday, when Boyd was caring for the child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Frawley said the district attorney's office is unsure of what 
charges to file at this point since it is hard to say whether the child will 
live or die. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and neighbors said Boyd was a proud father. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, Terry Kessler, said he knows that Boyd did not hurt the child and 
thinks the Sheriff's Department should have investigated more before arresting 
Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they may have jumped the gun a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he would love to see the child, but a restraining order has been 
issued that prohibits him from approaching within 10 feet of the hospital or 
seeing Payne, whom he has dated for 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he is concerned about the child's welfare and would like to gain 
custody of the baby. The child is now in the custody of the state, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said the baby's illness came just months after Boyd's father died of 
cancer. His father's death was extremely difficult, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"If something happened to Jacob, I don't know what I'd do," he said.

1 HOSPITALIZED AFTER TRUCK CRUSHES CAR 
</P>

<P>
The driver of a car that was crushed beneath an 18-wheel truck on the Ventura 
Freeway in Thousand Oaks was listed in good condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yaron Nechemia, 25, of Agoura was admitted to the intensive care unit at 
Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village for observation after the accident, 
a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nechemia was driving his Nissan Sentra south on the freeway, near the Live Oak 
underpass, about 11:45 a.m. Tuesday when a truck on his right tried to move 
into his lane, said Officer Jim Utter of the California Highway Patrol. Lori 
Nechemia, 28, and Elissa Nechemia, 16 months, also were in the Nissan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation showed that Nechemia tried to avoid the truck and 
lost control of his car, which spun in front of the truck, Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, which was driven by Jesus Arauz, 35, of North Hollywood, struck the 
car, Utter said. The car continued to spin out of control and lodged under the 
right side of the trailer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck veered and left the road, still dragging the car. As the truck went 
up an embankment, the car dislodged, Utter said. But the truck overturned and 
came to rest on the Nissan, crushing it and trapping the occupants, Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
It took more than an hour for the Ventura County Fire Department to extricate 
the Nechemias from their car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arauz suffered minor injuries. Lori Nechemia received severe facial injuries 
with cuts to the scalp and the child received minor cuts and scratches, Utter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They and Arauz were taken by ambulance to Westlake Medical Center. All except 
Yaron Nechemia were treated and released, hospital personnel said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaron and Lori Nechemia were wearing seat belts and the child was riding in a 
car seat, which tipped sideways and protected her as the car was crushed, Utter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is continuing, he said. CAROL WATSON

An Oxnard man who was towing a friend's pickup narrowly missed serious injury 
when his car was hit by an Amtrak train, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Eugene McAdams had stopped Tuesday night for the railroad warning lights 
at 5th Street and Rice Road when he realized he had pulled too close to the 
tracks, Oxnard Police Sgt. Gene Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled forward a bit and the crossing arm came down on the chain between 
his car and the one he was towing. Everyone jumped out of their cars and ran, 
and the train struck the car on the tracks," Thayer said. 
</P>
<P>
McAdams and his friend were not hurt in the 7:05 p.m. incident. KAREN MCKEAN

SUSPECT SURRENDERS IN FATAL SHOOTING OF OCEANSIDE GIRL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ANOTHER SUSPECT IN WHAT MIGHT BE THE CITY'S FIRST GANG-RELATED KILLING 
IS RELEASED AS AKELI S. KELLY, 21, TURNS HIMSELF IN TO POLICE.

<P>
A suspect in the possible gang-related shooting death of a 14-year-old girl 
surrendered to Oceanside police Wednesday and was expected to be booked for 
murder, while another suspect was released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
Police still haven't found a motive in the killing of Michele Tate but have 
increased patrols in the gang-troubled area where she died Monday night from a 
single bullet that also wounded a 17-year-old pregnant companion. 
</P>
<P>
And amid neighborhood tension, the Oceanside Unified School District has 
rescheduled Friday night's traditional football game between Oceanside and El 
Camino high schools to Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Security at the game, a 15-year intra-city rivalry, will be doubled to 25 to 30 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
A major development in the case came at 9:40 a.m. Wednesday when Akeli S. 
Kelly, 21, of Oceanside, walked into the police station with an attorney and 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be booked into County Jail for murder," Senior Officer Bob 
George said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly was interviewed, but George said "anything he says we can't talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Talofa Finouga Jr., 19, who had been arrested Tuesday morning in 
connection with the incident, was released from custody at 11:30 that night. 
</P>
<P>
"There's insufficient evidence to charge him with any crime," Officer E.J. 
Luarca said. We do not believe he's the shooter." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, police believed both Kelly and Finouga might have occupied the car 
that some witnesses said drove past Alberto's Mexican Food at Redondo Drive and 
North River Road as Michele Tate and three friends emerged. 
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting accounts of the incident. "It's actually the first 
fatal drive-by shooting in the city of Oceanside, if in fact it's a drive by," 
George said. 
</P>
<P>
One shot reportedly was fired, hitting Michele in the back and wounding Stacey 
Prince. Michele was declared dead at Tri-City Medical Center while Prince was 
treated and released from Palomar Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"As of yet, we haven't determined a motive," said Luarca, who added police have 
neither identified or recovered the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are investigating whether the incident was motivated by hostility 
between rival gangs that are known to exist in the area where Michele died. It 
is located in eastern Oceanside near Camp Pendleton's back gate. 
</P>
<P>
A police report last year said there was increasing violence between groups 
called Samoan Bloods and the Deep Valley Posse, a black gang. 
</P>
<P>
The victims of Monday night's shooting are black while both Finouga and Kelly 
are Samoan, but police have declined to say whether they believe any of the 
people involved are gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Mecaela Tate, the mother of Michele, who was a freshman at El Camino High 
School, denied earlier this week that her daughter belonged to a gang. Tate 
said the girl was slain by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the city was quiet in the aftermath of the shooting and 
additional patrol units were dispatched to the area where the shooting 
occurred.

VICTIM OF FIRE WAS SETTING BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fire that damaged a National City clothing store in early September was set 
by its owner, who died in the blaze, fire investigators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
My-Hue Gager, 45, died of smoke inhalation after using gasoline to try to burn 
down M H Clothing Contractor in the 2400 block of Southport Way on Sept. 7 as 
part of an attempted insurance fraud, a National City police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the National City fire and police departments and the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms released the results of their 
investigation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy revealed gasoline on the body and clothing of Gager, who was found 
unconscious by firefighters, the spokeswoman said. Gasoline also was found at 
the fire's point of origin, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gager's business was failing badly and she tried to destroy the store to claim 
the insurance, the spokeswoman said. She was alone in the building about 11 
p.m. and became trapped by the gasoline-fed flames, the spokeswoman said.

SOVIET PSYCHIATRISTS TOUR STATE HOSPITAL

<P>
A group of Soviet psychiatrists who toured Camarillo State Hospital on 
Wednesday said they were impressed by the low number of patients at the 
facility but agreed that the United States needs to do more for the mentally 
ill on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"You may not have overcrowding in your wards, but you have overcrowding with 
the same type of people on the streets," said Boris Lebedev, the head of 
psychiatric faculty at the First Leningrad Medical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that problem." 
</P>
<P>
But Revaz Uturgauri, assistant to the head of the Department of International 
Humanitarian Cooperation and Human Rights, added: "We're not here looking for 
your problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have quite a few problems at home. We're here looking for solutions." 
</P>
<P>
The visit, part of a national tour of mental health facilities, was arranged 
through the National Institute of Mental Health as part of an exchange between 
the two countries. A U.S. team of psychiatrists and other mental health experts 
visited the Soviet Union in 1989 to assess psychiatric practices there. 
</P>
<P>
American experts found that a vast number of Soviet facilities were 
overcrowded, said John Finerty, a congressional staff assistant who attended 
the Camarillo tour. 
</P>
<P>
About six years ago, the Soviet Union's Psychiatric Society was expelled from 
the World Psychiatric Assn. after being accused of placing political dissidents 
in mental institutions and diagnosing them as mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Psychiatric Society was provisionally readmitted to the 
association earlier this year, more reforms are needed. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had hoped the national tour would give the Soviet psychiatrists 
the basis for change and a chance to learn from America's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 Soviet psychiatrists, including some of the country's leading experts, 
have spent two weeks traveling from Washington to California visiting U.S. 
mental health facilities and homeless shelters. TINA DAUNT

'DIATRIBE' ON GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scurrilous outburst in a letter of Aug. 5 aimed at the 1989-90 Ventura 
County Grand Jury, apparently written by labor organizer Barry Hammitt, can 
actually have one beneficial result. 
</P>
<P>
People may be stimulated to read the 1989-90 grand jury reports, especially the 
report on substance abuse, which seemed to be the major cause of this peculiar 
outburst. 
</P>
<P>
Readers should be making their own judgments about significant matters 
discussed in the reports in order to form their own opinions. 
</P>
<P>
As with any institution, even the 1,000-year-old grand jury system, review and 
reanalysis are always essential and vital to a democracy. I may, with 
apologies, refer to my own analysis, which was published in the July 11 issue 
of the News Chronicle of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Constructive change, however, is always the result of quiet reflection and 
civilized exchanges of views, not of explosive diatribes.

REACTION TO 'OJAI LAW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the article "Ojai Law" on Sept. 20, I am sure "The Krishnamurti 
People" rejoice, as I do, in businesses that advertise with beauty. 
</P>
<P>
I fail to see this as "failure for Krishnamurti"! 
</P>
<P>
I do complain, however. One of my complaints is about a small building 
completely covered with signs -- 29 violations of the ordinance. I also 
complain about the "clutter" of hanging signs in the Arcade. But I congratulate 
the businesses in the Arcade whose signs are part of their facade.

SHOCKED BY STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with more than 200 others, I attended the LAFCO hearing on Sept. 12 in 
support of the request of Simi Valley for a quick review of the proposed 
annexation of the Jordan and Runkle ranches. 
</P>
<P>
I was shocked to read a published remark by Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, 
2nd District, that most of us came because of the inducement of "a free ride 
and a free meal." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the others there, I came on my own. I felt strongly enough to take 
time off from work to speak out on what I consider to be one of the best 
opportunities offered to the people of Ventura County in my recollection. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. VanderKolk, being new to the area and new to politics, has yet to learn 
that most of the people she has been elected to represent are not so crass as 
to be bought for the price of a free bus ride or a doughnut.

TRIAL OF REPUTED MOBSTER PETTI OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The money-laundering trial of reputed mobster Chris Petti began Wednesday in 
federal court with distribution to 100 jurors of a questionnaire that asked how 
many people had heard of San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-page, 54-question form made no mention of Petti's reputed mob ties. 
</P>
<P>
And prosecutors agreed Wednesday to avoid using words like "Mafia," "mob" and 
"organized crime" when the presentation of evidence begins in the case -- 
likely next week. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 63, of San Diego, was charged along with Silberman in a seven-count 
indictment on charges of laundering $300,000 in cash that an undercover FBI 
agent portrayed as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who served as an aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was 
convicted in June -- after a two-month trial -- of a single felony count, a 
violation of federal currency laws. In August, he pleaded guilty to an 
additional felony conspiracy charge, avoiding a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving sentenced Silberman last week to 46 
months in federal prison. On Tuesday, Irving also imposed a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
It was through Petti that Silberman was introduced to the undercover agent, 
Peter Ahearn, who posed as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug lords, 
prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's arrest actually resulted from a lengthy investigation by federal 
authorities into Petti's activities. By October, 1988, FBI agents had been busy 
for months investigating Petti and mob interest in gaming operations at the 
Rincon Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
That October, Silberman, who had known Petti for 15 years -- they first met at 
a Mission Valley hotel barbershop -- asked him for help in finding people 
interested in laundering cash, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
Petti has pleaded not guilty to all seven counts.

BEST BETS: A NIGHT AT THE BALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think attending a ballet is just too daunting, tonight may be a chance 
to prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The Dorril B. Wright Cultural Center in Port Hueneme is welcoming the Royal New 
Zealand Ballet, performing "Coppelia" for one night only. 
</P>
<P>
Embarking on their first U.S. tour, the 40-member company has toured 
extensively in Europe and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular production is very easy to follow for the ballet layman," 
Denis Murrin, director of the cultural center, said. "It's really an accessible 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
Written in the late 1800s, the story follows a doll maker whose masterwork is a 
mechanical, life-size female figurine, so lifelike it fools the township as it 
frolics from an outdoor balcony. 
</P>
<P>
However, "the plot is not the integral part to this ballet," Murrin said, "The 
beauty of this performance is the choreography, dancing and music." 
</P>
<P>
The production will be staged at 8 p.m. The cultural center is at 575 Surfside 
Drive, Port Hueneme. Tickets are $20. Call 986-6598.

SALTY HOT DOGS, 'GOLDEN'-FLAVORED POPCORN AND GRAFFITI IN A GAUDY RESTROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
This is installment No. 5 in our biweekly look at the movie theaters of Ventura 
County. This week we went to Oxnard to visit The Mann Theatres at 271 Esplanade 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Food: If only the hot dog had been as plain as the bun. The bun was soft, fresh 
and bland, but the dog tasted like a salt stick. The mustard came in small 
packages, the kind that are difficult to open and use while sitting in the dark 
in a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
One thing about the popcorn confused us: The liquid topping was billed as 
having "delicious golden flavoring." Not chartreuse flavoring, but golden. 
Whatever it was, it settled at about midpoint in our popcorn box, so the top 
half was quite enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: Who was the color consultant? A little bit of brown, a little bit of 
white, a lot of black and touches of orange and yellow. Unfortunately, things 
went downhill after the initial shock of the color scheme. Lots of graffiti, 
only one out of three sinks had working cold water and one of the urinals was 
overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie entertainment: Before the power in theater No. 3 went out, the music 
was festive orchestral Muzak, reminiscent of the holiday season. It served as 
background for the Mann house film, full of lots of ads for food and films, and 
a little trivia. After the electricity was restored, there was more of the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Previews: One. 
</P>
<P>
Seats: Comfortable but marred by rips and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
The first 100 patrons who show up Friday at the Carriage Square Cinema in 
Oxnard to see the Disney classic "Fantasia," will receive a piece of 'Fantasia 
50th Anniversary' celebration cake. Cake will be served before the first 
showing at 12:30. For information call 485-6726. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Ojai Film Society will show the widely acclaimed 1989 Australian 
movie "Sweetie," the first feature film of director Jane Campion, who has been 
referred to as the female David Lynch. The film is rated R. Show time at the 
Ojai Playhouse is 4:30 p.m. The theater is at 145 E. Ojai Ave. LEO SMITH

WHEN IT COMES TO GIVING PAPER A SECOND LIFE, EVEN HOLLYWOOD HAS FOUND A USE FOR 
SCRAP PAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because curbside recycling hasn't reached my block yet, I virtuously schlep my 
old newspapers to the recycling center. It used to be that a car trunk load got 
me $5. Last week my efforts resulted in one lonely dollar. Despite the 
conventional wisdom, virtue is not its own reward. I want more of a quid pro 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sore at the recycler, really. He operates in the marketplace just like 
everyone else. And as readers of this column know, I am beady-eyed (rather 
dewy-eyed) about the connection between the environment and money. So what is 
going on in the recycled paper marketplace? (In a previous column I described 
the way office paper recycling works, but that involved the boss's pocketbook.) 
</P>
<P>
The "consumer generated" scrap paper market is only temporarily glutted, it 
seems. As new mills for recycled paper come on-line next year, prices will 
stabilize up and down the manufacturing chain. State and federal laws have 
mandated a gradual switch to 50% recycled content when it comes to newsprint. 
I'm not counting on getting $5 trunk loads in the near future. But I'm going to 
go on schlepping for another reason: to keep that stuff out of the landfill. 
That'll spare me eventual monthly garbage pickup fees that threaten all of us 
if the new state garbage reduction law (AB 939) isn't observed. 
</P>
<P>
Apropos newsprint: When they printed today's Times, only two out of 10 of the 
big rolls fed into the press were made of "virgin" wood pulp. The other eight 
-- and its headed for 10 out of 10 -- contained a mix of 50% virgin fiber and 
50% recycled paper. The Times is already the biggest consumer of recycled 
newsprint in America. 
</P>
<P>
As for junk mail, paper packaging and magazines, this is known in the 
marketplace as "mixed paper." This stuff I hate. It's sort of a man-made 
version of the mosquito. You wonder what it's for. But unlike the mosquito 
there's an answer -- finally. 
</P>
<P>
Here's some background. About a year ago everybody discovered the waste crisis. 
Paper manufacturers went in for using "post consumer" scrap in a big way. 
Unisource, a major paper distributor in this county, carried three grades of 
recycled paper last year. Now, increased manufacturing activity has the firm 
carrying up to 10 grades and they're "on allocation." That means demand 
outstrips supply. Armando Torres, Unisource's man in Ventura, says, "It's not 
going to go away, like '73 and '74." 
</P>
<P>
Also, prices have finally come down to the level nearly of "virgin" paper. 
Local printers report that government, service clubs and businesses (such as 
Patagonia) are specifying recycled stock for reports and catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
I like this news. Environmental virtue should not be penalized financially. And 
the reverse should not be allowed either. Federal subsidies have made 
lumber-based paper manufacturing artificially cheap. But this year, new laws 
and vigorous entrepreneurship have changed that. When it comes to giving paper 
the second life it deserves, there are folks hereabouts who are doing well by 
doing good. (See details below) In fact, The Times has just learned that the 
topic of a new film Ted Danson is developing for Paramount Pictures is scrap 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
At Procter &amp; Gamble's paper plant in Oxnard, Charmin and Bounty are usually 
produced. These are top of the line products that use long-fiber virgin pulp. 
But when P&amp;G and other manufacturers do "private brand" production for 
grocery store chains, it involves recycled paper and is labeled as such. 
P&amp;G's Henry Racine, as droll and matter-of-fact as you'd expect a veteran 
paper maker to be, characterized this section of the business as "turning an 
aggravation into a contribution." 
</P>
<P>
You can do likewise by checking out today's Details and buying recycled paper. 
You see, next week I'm loading my trunk with scrap paper again. Get out there 
and buy recycled. Make me rich. 
</P>
<P>

VENTURA COUNTY SYMPHONY SOUNDS OUT ITS OPTIONS ON FUTURE COURSE

<P>
The Ventura County Symphony will open its 29th season on a high note this 
weekend, with good ticket sales, a healthy budget and what is probably the best 
set of musicians it has ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
But backstage, the musicians are singing another tune. Says one symphony 
member: 
</P>
<P>
"It probably all comes down to a matter of identity. I think we are having a 
midlife crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, musicians and others say, the symphony is ready to break its anchor at 
the Oxnard Civic Auditorium and expand. Perhaps it is time for the county 
orchestra to become truly countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already filling the house, but I would like to see enough interest so we 
could double or triple the number of concerts, or play in different parts of 
the county," said Frank Salazar, symphony conductor. "I think we could support 
it now." The orchestra has scheduled six concerts during the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, question whether that kind of thinking will bring the Ventura 
County Symphony the same financial woes experienced by larger symphonies across 
the country. Numerous orchestras in recent years, including the Oakland 
Symphony, New Orleans Symphony, Oklahoma City Symphony, Denver Symphony and the 
Nashville Symphony, have been forced to file for bankruptcy, cancel entire 
seasons or shorten their performing schedules. 
</P>
<P>
If the Ventura County Symphony decides to expand, higher costs are inevitable. 
Higher salaries and benefits would have to be paid and there would be increased 
administrative costs. This, with changing demographics and an economic 
downturn, could spell trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Orchestras with our budget size are usually more secure," said Lynda Collum, 
Ventura County Symphony operations manager. "It's when they go to being a 
full-time orchestra that a lot of them get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Salazar said a decision to expand the orchestra's season ultimately will be 
made on the basis of ticket sales and donations. But other conductors, having 
found themselves in similar situations, say that expansion requires an 
aggressive approach to fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very lofty to believe that music sells itself, but it doesn't," 
Leonard Slatkin, conductor of the St. Louis Symphony, said earlier this year. 
"You have to do something if you want an orchestra to grow." 
</P>
<P>
With an annual budget of $620,000 -- nearly triple the combined budgets of the 
Conejo Symphony Orchestra, the Camarillo Symphony Orchestra and the Simi Valley 
Community Orchestra -- the Ventura County Symphony is clearly the county's 
leading music organization. Thanks to both a shrinking job market in Los 
Angeles and a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts, the symphony has 
steadily attracted top players from around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestras in this country have been classified by the American Symphony 
Orchestra League according to their budget, which in turn usually determines 
length of season and caliber of players and soloists they can attract. 
</P>
<P>
Major orchestras, such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the San Francisco 
Symphony have budgets over $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Regional orchestras such as the San Jose Symphony and the Long Beach Symphony 
have budgets between $1 million and $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan orchestras such as the Glendale Symphony and the Fresno 
Philharmonic have budgets between $280,000 and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Urban orchestras such as the Conejo Symphony Orchestra and the Garden Grove 
Symphony have budgets between $135,000 and $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
Community orchestras such as the Camarillo Symphony Orchestra and the Antelope 
Valley Symphony are those with budgets under $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago the Ventura County Symphony moved into the metropolitan 
category. And today, as it edges closer to the $1-million mark, no one is 
asking whether the symphony has the ability to become a more prestigious 
regional orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the question seems to be: "Does Ventura County have the wherewithal -- 
or even the desire -- to maintain a regional orchestra?" 
</P>
<P>
With three orchestras playing on the same county stage and the Santa Barbara 
Symphony only a short distance away, some are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many orchestras," said USC orchestra conductor Daniel Lewis, who 
conducted the Pasadena Symphony for 11 years. "People used to be able to donate 
to one orchestra, and now it's one of five or 10. When you all are begging for 
the same dollars, it's difficult to support them." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and others say ticket sales generally account for only 40% of an 
orchestra's operating budget. The rest comes from government grants, endowment 
earnings and corporate and private gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Although most major orchestras can depend on significant "snob dollars" -- 
sizeable donations from wealthy patrons for prestige purposes -- the Ventura 
County Symphony can't. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the county's orchestra, not a specific city's, and yet we play at the 
Oxnard Civic Auditorium, said Symphony board President Miriam Wille. "It's an 
acoustically wonderful hall, but a lot of people probably think that nothing of 
any cultural value could possibly exist in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
That isn't to say, Wille said, that the county lacks potential donors. But not 
everyone, she said, knows the difference between the various orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the county are new," Wille said. "They either don't know we 
exist or confuse us with a volunteer or amateur orchestra. It's frustrating not 
to stand out in the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
And if the competition weren't already stiff enough, an estimated 10% of the 
Santa Barbara Symphony's season ticket subscribers come from Ventura County, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But then, not everyone sees the existence of several orchestras in Ventura 
County and another one in Santa Barbara as a problem. To Harvey Roth, executive 
director of the Conejo Symphony Orchestra, multiple orchestras are an asset. 
The Conejo Symphony Orchestra, made up of amateurs and professionals with an 
annual budget of $192,000, begins its 30th season on Oct. 13 in the California 
Lutheran University auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having two restaurants next to each other," Roth said. "We aren't in 
competition. We play different music, our soloists are different and our dates 
are sometimes different. The more music in the county, the better." 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis, of USC, said Ventura County's musical appetite might be better 
served with just one orchestra. "If they could support one orchestra to play in 
many locations, the function would be served of having music in all the 
communities," he said. "Then there would be no charge for the administration of 
all the others. The caliber of playing would also be higher." 
</P>
<P>
Even if that scenario were possible, there remains the question of whether 
Ventura County really wants a roving, regional orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, for instance, local members of the nationwide Community Concert 
Assn. select various musical groups from throughout the United States. The 
selections are made from a catalogue published by the Community Concert Assn.'s 
East Coast office, which lists groups according to a city's budget and 
auditorium size. 
</P>
<P>
The first of four concerts in the series begins tonight in the Simi Valley High 
School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Would the local association consider instead spending the money on a concert by 
the Ventura County Symphony? 
</P>
<P>
Geri Gaines, president of the association's Simi Valley chapter, said no. "I 
couldn't," she said. "They're not in our catalogue."

ON THE PAGE BEFORE YOU, THE NOTES SWAM LIKE DAZED GUPPIES. THEN CAME YOUR PIECE 
AND YOUR MOMENT. . . .

The best part came first. You drove to the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, rolled 
right past the main entrance and pulled up in back by the stage door -- your 
door. Not general admission for you. On this night you would be a percussionist 
with the Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"The cool thing about being a percussionist," said Mark Zimoski a few minutes 
later, "is you're sitting back among a bunch of other percussionists, and 
there's no problem just leaning back and whispering, 'Where are we?' We do it 
all the time. Well, we don't do it all the time . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At least Zimoski doesn't. He is the principal percussionist, having played with 
the Ventura County Symphony for nine years. He is also an optimist. While a few 
early string players sawed their bows under the harsh stage lights, he spread 
some sheets of music on a kettle drum and offered choices. A waltz? A march? 
You, a retired garage-band drummer, dithered. 
</P>
<P>
This was only a rehearsal but a full one: 85 professional and semiprofessional 
musicians under the direction of a baton-wielding conductor, with just a few 
hours together to prepare for a performance five days hence. If a newcomer 
succeeded here, whole new opportunities in rhythm could lie ahead. Zimoski got 
his start, after all, in circumstances even more modest. There he was, an 
undirected youth, pounding out rock 'n' roll drum exercises in a San Fernando 
Valley suburb, when two members of the Mothers of Invention moved in next door. 
</P>
<P>
The Mothers of Invention, of course, was an intellectual rock band led by Frank 
Zappa and influenced by such far-flung composers as Muddy Waters and Edgard 
Varese. Yet when Ian and Ruth Underwood heard Zimoski practicing rock 'n' roll 
drums in the next house, they sensed something they liked. 
</P>
<P>
They invited Zimoski to turn pages at a rehearsal -- "it was all I could do to 
keep up with the measures, let alone what was in them" -- and made some 
introductions. That was two decades ago and now Zimoski, 37 years old, lives in 
Van Nuys and makes his living by driving around Southern California and banging 
on things. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why he gave you the benefit of the doubt. He believed you when you 
said you could read music, took it in stride when you opted for the triangle 
part in Johann Strauss Jr.'s "Tales From the Vienna Woods." And he cheerfully 
placed before you a gleaming chrome triangle and a pair of metal swizzle 
sticks. Triangle beaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now things were happening fast. The straggling players had congealed into an 
orchestra. Conductor Frank Salazar had appeared up front and you stood behind a 
big black music stand, snare drum at your right elbow, bass drum at your left. 
</P>
<P>
"Tales From the Vienna Woods," your showcase, was in waltz time, with an 
introductory section of about 20 measures before the triangle's appearance. You 
would beat half a dozen whole notes, followed by a four-measure roll and a few 
more whole notes. Then later on, after a few twists, turns, repeats and rests, 
a few quarter notes. 
</P>
<P>
You eyed the sheet music, fingered your triangle beaters and the music began. 
Brass, woodwinds, violins -- all sounded at the appropriate moments. In the 
percussion section, too, it was business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Zimoski assaulted the timpani. Bill Ricketts, a calm, 27-year-old from 
Montebello, boomed at the bass drum. Marie Matson, a 31-year-old Panorama City 
resident, stood alertly at the snare drum. And Wade Culbreath, a tall 
25-year-old from Sherman Oaks, stood at the end of the line, cymbals in hand. 
</P>
<P>
As the music bounced along, they rolled, rattled and rumbled, occasionally 
stealing glances your way and counting aloud for your benefit. On the page 
before you, the notes swam like dazed guppies. 
</P>
<P>
Then came your piece and your moment. A sudden, ugly moment it was. Time 
expanded and contracted. Immense and indistinct ideas seized your mind. 
Onetwothree.... Onthebeat.... AmIsweating? HowdoIread ... andwatchtheconductor? 
Onetwothree.... Aretheystaring? HaveIrepliedtothat weddinginvitation ... 
fromMichaelandDonna? Onetwothree.... Isthereabreeze? Evenstrokes Wait. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You started early on the half-dozen whole notes. 
</P>
<P>
You came in late on the four-measure roll. 
</P>
<P>
You abandoned entirely the idea of coming back in with whole notes. 
</P>
<P>
And the orchestra played on, like seasoned commuters roaring past a spin-out in 
the slow lane. The conductor ignored you. 
</P>
<P>
You assessed the damage. In theory, that roll would have included some 192 16th 
notes. No one expected that. But had they bargained for the sound of a 
3-year-old child, set free among the wind chimes at The Nature Company? 
</P>
<P>
You were still useless when the next passage arrived. Again you started early, 
only this time, in your haste to silence the resounding triangle, you rattled 
the music stand. Now you imagined the erect hairs on the back of every neck in 
the violin section. On the last pass, when nothing mattered anymore, you 
entered and exited properly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," whispered calm Bill Ricketts at your side. "Now you're a star." 
</P>
<P>
Optimism, it turns out, is endemic among percussionists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREMISE 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of things you have never tried. Fun things, dangerous things, 
character building things. The Reluctant Novice tries them for you and reports 
the results. After all, the Novice gets paid to do them -- and has no choice in 
the matter. If you want to tell the Novice where to go, please call us at 
658-5547. If we use your idea, we'll send you a present. This week's Reluctant 
Novice is staff writer Christopher Reynolds.

IT'S THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN BUYERS AND GROWERS ARE GOING NUTS OVER THE CROP 
OF WALNUTS. 
</P>

<P>
Oh, nuts, it's that time of year again. Sturdy shells are emerging from 
withering hulls, hitting the ground to await their ultimate destiny -- added 
crunch and flavor to any number of recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's about 224 acres of walnuts have matured and are being readied 
for a frenzied holiday-time market. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time -- now through the end of the year -- walnut sales are at 
their highest," Betty DeBusschere said. She and her husband, Don, own Rancho 
Shangrila in Ojai and grow 40 acres of walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Shangrila features the English walnut variety -- a more oval-shaped 
walnut whose "meats are easier to remove than the rounder black walnut," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"People will buy walnuts and keep them in their freezer to have on hand when 
they start baking -- mostly cookies -- for Thanksgiving and Christmas time," 
DeBusschere said. 
</P>
<P>
Dormant through the winter months, walnut trees blossom the first of May, and 
within a few weeks, the first signs of the nut appear. 
</P>
<P>
Each developing walnut is encased by a protective green hull, which during this 
time of year is in the process of drying and letting the now-fortified shell 
drop to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they start dropping," DeBusschere said, "the walnuts are picked up by 
hand." Some growers, however, use a mechanized "walnut sweeper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are those stubborn nuts that haven't the wherewithal to fall on their 
own, so a little coaxing is in order. 
</P>
<P>
A long-armed contraption is attached to the tree. "The walnut shaker has a 
rubber protected hand that is clamped to the tree, and after the machine is 
turned on, the tree is shaken for about 30 seconds," DeBusschere said. Some 
walnuts will fall with the hulls intact, but market-ready walnuts need to be 
void of this outer casing. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put them in a machine that pretty much looks and works like a clothes 
dryer," she said, "As the walnuts tumble, the hulls fall off and drop through 
holes in the drum." 
</P>
<P>
The walnuts, dirtied by their fall to the ground, are then given a bath. 
</P>
<P>
"After washing, we dry them at 100 degrees for about 12 hours," which kills 
damaging molds, DeBusschere said. 
</P>
<P>
The walnuts of Rancho Shangrila are grown organically, which means one more 
step is needed before they hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our buyers will freeze the walnuts for a few days before they are shelled," 
she said. The alternative, of course, would be to apply pesticides to control 
any tiny critters clinging on. 
</P>
<P>
DeBusschere said walnuts can be kept in the freezer for several years, for use 
whenever needed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not just for baking," she said, "they can also be added to dishes like 
stir-fry vegetables and salads." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rancho Shangrila will not have its roadside stand set up this year, 
the walnuts can be purchased at the Ventura County Farmers Market. The market 
is held 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesdays at Main Street and Mills Road, and 8:30 
a.m. to noon Saturdays at Santa Clara and Figueroa streets in Ventura. For more 
information about the market -- which features fresh produce and other items 
from area farmers -- call 529-6266.

60% INCREASE IN IMMIGRATION VOTED BY HOUSE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major overhaul of the nation's immigration policies, the House voted 
Tuesday to allow an estimated 60% more visas for foreigners to legally live and 
work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing from 500,000 to at least 775,000 the overall number 
of visas issued each year, the bill would create a new category for immigrants 
from countries whose nationals largely have been excluded because of the 
current emphasis on family reunification. This provision is aimed at opening 
the doors to more Europeans and also would allow a greater number of Africans 
to resettle here. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has threatened to veto the House's Family Unity and Employment 
Opportunity Act but supports a Senate version that would approve about 630,000 
new visas each year. 
</P>
<P>
The present immigration law, enacted 25 years ago, emphasized family 
reunification to such a degree that about 85% of visas went to Asians and Latin 
Americans. As a result, nationals from 30 countries in Europe and elsewhere 
found their names far down priority waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
The bill perpetuates the current emphasis on family unity -- and in fact 
increases the number of family-related visas. But it increases opportunities 
for other groups not only through the new visa category, but by increasing the 
number of employment-related visas. 
</P>
<P>
The total cap of about 775,000 does not include those who enter the country as 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
During a day and a half of often contentious debate, opponents painted the bill 
as a congressional gift to special interest groups that cater to minority and 
immigrant issues, at the expense of American workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We can reach down and train our workers or take in large numbers of 
immigrants," pleaded Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), who led the floor fight against 
the bill. "We can't do both." 
</P>
<P>
But supporters argued that the legislation would allow more American citizens 
to be reunited with their foreign-born families, and at the same time entice 
eager and ambitious future taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Calling immigrants "self-selected strivers," Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), 
a key supporter, said that passage would be "the most far-reaching and 
important reform of our legal immigration policy." 
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add $57 million 
to the budget deficit in 1991 and $210 million in 1992, in part because of 
mandatory entitlements such as welfare payments, Medicaid and unemployment 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The net cost figures include estimates that the bill would raise $60 million in 
1991 and $110 million by 1994 by charging employers who sponsor immigrants. 
That money is to be used for retraining and educating U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the bill complained that it would prove disastrous to the nation, 
flooding the country with more people than the economy can absorb. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the legislation hailed its passage, while pledging to 
continue to press for its enactment into law. 
</P>
<P>
A conference committee to iron out differences in House and Senate versions is 
expected to begin next week. It is unclear if the committee will be able to 
reconcile the two bills before Congress adjourns later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The House version passed Wednesday, 231 to 192. The Senate bill passed last 
year, 87 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no limit on the number of visas issued to spouses, minor 
children and parents of U.S. citizens. However, a cap that allows no more than 
20,000 immigrants from any one country effectively limited the number of 
immediate relatives who could join their families in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The new bill would remove the per country cap on numbers of immigrants. 
Legislators do not expect an immediate increase in the number of family visas, 
under which about 220,000 people immigrate annually. However, the removal of 
the cap likely will increase the figures when illegal alien workers under the 
amnesty program begin receiving citizenship in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
More distant relatives, for example adult siblings and their spouses, would be 
in line to receive 300,000 visas under the bill -- up from the current 216,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new category allows for 55,000 "diversity" visas each year for natives of 
regions where immigration has been lower than 50,000 over the previous five 
years. The nations considered "adversely affected" by the current law are 
primarily European. Under the provision, Ireland and Northern Ireland are 
considered separate nations -- indicating that the Irish will get a 
disproportionate share of the visas in this category. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bill provides temporary redress by providing 25,000 additional 
visas in this category for three years. Another 15,000 visas will be 
temporarily set aside for East European refugees. Finally, the continent of 
Africa, which has a low history of immigration to the United States, gets an 
additional 15,000 visas during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also increase the number of work-related visas from the current 
limit of about 54,000 for permanent workers to 65,000 in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
In Florida, Miami Herald state editor John Pancake is having political 
reporters skip some of the speeches at county fairs this year and instead watch 
a little more TV. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, Clayton W. Williams Jr., the Republican candidate for governor, had 
to redo one of his television commercials because reporters found he had 
exaggerated his claims with faulty statistics. 
</P>
<P>
And in his TV ads in California, Sen. Pete Wilson, Republican gubernatorial 
candidate, has defended himself against an attack commercial by Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein by quoting newspaper articles critiquing the accuracy of Feinstein's 
original ad. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the American news media have embarked on what many campaign 
professionals and journalists consider the first real advance in press coverage 
of politics since Theodore White began looking behind the scenes at the 
mechanics of campaigning in his landmark book, "The Making of the President 
1960." 
</P>
<P>
From California to Florida, the press is devoting a major part of its time and 
resources to policing the accuracy of political TV commercials -- in most cases 
in systemic critiques set in special ad watch columns that have come to be 
known as "truth boxes." 
</P>
<P>
While this change might not strike casual readers as dramatic, it represents 
two important shifts. One is formal recognition that, to the extent elections 
define the national agenda, American political dialogue, in great part, now 
occurs in the exchange of TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The other is that, amid broad discontent with the state of political 
campaigning, the press has decided to become less of a color commentator up in 
the booth and more of a referee on the field in the hope of cleaning up the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, for the last 20 years, "you got a kind of nostalgic reporting," about 
politics, in the words of Democratic consultant Robert Squier. The media, 
particularly newspapers, focused on what candidates said in speeches and issue 
papers, things even the candidates themselves considered a largely symbolic 
part of their campaigns. "They were covering things that no longer really 
influenced the process," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Fiedler, political editor of the Miami Herald, believes that the "ad watch" 
columns now appearing in several Florida newspapers have made print media "more 
relevant" to politics for the first time in a generation. One key reason is 
that candidates who are attacked in commercials are using the newspaper 
critiques of the attacks in their response ads. 
</P>
<P>
"We are affecting the debate again," Fiedler said. 
</P>
<P>
Many political consultants are angry over the "truth boxes," saying the press 
has overstepped its neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
Yet so far, the effort has not stopped dishonest, distorted and false political 
advertising. "We've had some pretty rancid commercials here in Texas," said 
political editor Jim Simmon of the Houston Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that the media's more activist approach will take time, and 
that there are already signs of change, while others say the effort will only 
lead candidates to become more sophisticated and subtle in their distortions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'88 Campaign Cited 
</P>
<P>
The change this year was inspired, in part, by revulsion with the distortions, 
vitriol and 30-second rhetoric of the 1988 presidential campaign. But the roots 
go far deeper. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Love, now an executive with McClatchy Newspapers in Sacramento, publicly 
advocated something like truth boxes in 1986, after being disturbed by what he 
saw in the California Senate campaign. In that race, Alan Cranston and Ed 
Zschau spent a staggering $25 million combined, most of it to air commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"What I saw in 1986 is that candidates really don't do anything any more but 
raise money and put up TV ads," said Love, who covered the race for the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
But since the media scarcely dealt with ads, consultants and candidates were 
able to "get away with murder," Love said. "We had to become a referee (over 
advertising) or print would become obsolete to politics." 
</P>
<P>
After the 1988 presidential race, those concerns crystallized, journalists 
around the country say, in a series of columns Washington Post political 
reporter David Broder began writing last January. 
</P>
<P>
Broder argued that politics had become so "negative and nauseating" that the 
press had "to become partisan -- not on behalf of a candidate or party -- but 
on behalf of the process." Among the recommendations: "We need to treat every 
ad as if it were a speech" and not "be squeamish about saying in plain language 
when we catch a candidate lying . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Links to White's Books 
</P>
<P>
For much of the television age, political reporting in this country was 
fashioned on a variant of the model Theodore White developed 30 years ago for 
his series of books on "The Making of the President." White's innovative books 
saw elections as heroic clashes of men and ideology, offering insights into the 
national mood. But the books also were among the first to look backstage to the 
role of the campaign strategist and the growing emergence of campaign 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
As the black arts of campaigning became ever more refined -- through focus 
groups, polling and advertising techniques -- political reporting began to 
forgo the sense of national mood-taking and focus even more on internal 
matters, such as tactics, who was ahead, who had momentum and why. From White's 
"Making of the President," in effect, came Joe McGinnis' "The Selling of the 
President" in 1968, a book that saw campaigns largely as exercises in marketing 
and focused entirely on their inner workings. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a campaign stop came to be analyzed not so much for what a 
candidate said as why he felt a need to say it. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, this could be a fascinating look at what was occurring day to day 
inside the campaigns. But was it relevant to voters? 
</P>
<P>
And did writing about the strategy behind campaign rhetoric help check the 
rhetoric's distortions and manipulations or merely glorify the more effective 
manipulators? 
</P>
<P>
"Even as we have decried these tactics," Broder wrote, "we have magnified their 
effectiveness by publicizing the very messages we deplore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads: Least Covered 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, advertising, the key component of most campaigns, was perhaps the least 
covered aspect of all. The reasons are complex: it was difficult, reporters 
disdained it and most of them wanted to be with the candidate, not back home 
watching the tube. Besides, they argued, it was up to the candidates to counter 
the claims made against them. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, reporters on the road often never saw the TV commercials voters were 
seeing, and they privately scoffed at their simple messages. 
</P>
<P>
And much of the time campaign consultants who produced the ads flatly refused 
to make their commercials available to the press, arguing that they did not 
want to give away the element of surprise. Critics, such as Larry Sabato, 
professor of political science at the University of Virginia, argue that they 
also did not want to be subjected to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Even Broder, an advocate of the "truth boxes," concedes, "I have a lot of 
uneasiness," with the media moving into such an active role. "It changes the 
professional relationship from what it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In March of this year, while still covering politics for The Times, Love 
persuaded the paper to start analyzing TV commercials in print after seeing 
distortions in an attack ad produced for Democratic gubernatorial candidate 
John K. Van de Kamp in the California Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Once The Times started, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Sacramento Bee and 
KRON-TV in San Francisco quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
Papers in Texas also soon adopted the tactic, in part, in reaction to the 
vitriol of the state's gubernatorial primary. So did papers in Florida, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Georgia, Minnesota and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska, the Anchorage Daily News has taken the process one step further. 
Unwilling to let the candidates alone decide which issues define the governor's 
race, it conducted a comprehensive study to find out what Alaskans care about 
and is demanding that the candidates address those concerns in their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
And the practice may spread. A survey of political reporters and news directors 
around the country, conducted by People for the American Way, found that 80% 
now believe they "should play an aggressive role in exposing false or 
misleading advertising by political candidates." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, local television news organizations have not taken up 
critiquing commercials, with the apparent exception of KRON-TV and one station 
in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, television news reporters say privately, is that most stations' 
news directors are convinced by conventional research that finds audiences are 
bored by politics, and so they devote little time to the subject on a regular 
basis. Most local TV stations, for instance, do not have reporters covering 
politics on a full-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
But KRON's critiques suggest that TV has one great advantage newspapers do not: 
By showing sections of the ads, they can reveal the full nature of the 
distortions. 
</P>
<P>
In print, the styles of the "truth boxes" vary from strictly fact-oriented to 
wildly subjective. The Detroit Free Press has gone so far as to criticize the 
music in ads by gubernatorial candidate John Engler for sounding "more like a 
hardware store commercial than a spot touting someone to lead the state." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald's "Ad Watch" boxes are designed to be as subjective and 
"critical in their approach as our movie critics," Fiedler said. "That has made 
them more controversial but more effective." 
</P>
<P>
Some journalists even question whether "truth boxes" work, if they are too 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, whose editors at first raised questions about the propriety 
of ad boxes, may be the most cautious. One of its recent boxes, for instance, 
analyzed an ad by North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt that begins: 
"These days you need a warning label for your TV screens, because Jesse Helms 
ads are hazardous to the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times' cautious analysis offered something one would have thought 
obvious: "This commercial . . . tries to raise a credibility question about 
Helms' advertising." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction among political consultants to being critiqued has varied. "I 
don't think any of it should be done," Republican consultant Adam Goodman told 
the Political Hotline newsletter in August. "I think newspapers should present 
factual news and allow people to make their own endorsements." 
</P>
<P>
Others praise the practice. "At some point, you have to say I am a participant 
in a larger process and I have a professional responsibility to the process 
beyond just winning," said Don Sipple, the political consultant for Pete 
Wilson. "I think it is very very positive." 
</P>
<P>
And most news organizations involved in the critiques report that so far 
audience reaction has been unanimously favorable, even though this involves 
giving even more influence to the media. 
</P>
<P>
What good the critiques have done is hard to say. "We haven't turned Florida 
politicians into choir boys," said Pancake, the Miami Herald state editor. 
</P>
<P>
"All they're doing is exercising some kind of moral pressure on those of us in 
the business to be a little more accurate in our specific charges," Democratic 
consultant Ben Goddard told the Hotline. 
</P>
<P>
But campaigners who once refused even to give the press videotapes of their ads 
now often present them with full dossiers to substantiate the claims the ads 
contain. 
</P>
<P>
"The innuendoes are now documented," Democratic consultant Raymond Strother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another result, experts say, is that the critiques are being picked up by 
candidates in their response ads, which consultants say has greatly enhanced 
the ability of a candidate to respond to a false charge. 
</P>
<P>
Most in politics say that a single newspaper "truth box" run one time is not 
enough to stand against a distorted commercial that airs dozens of times a day. 
The criticism needs repetition to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald has tried running a capsule of its critiques several times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Sabato of the University of Virginia believes that newspapers should also 
publish election guides that devote a section on each race to advertising 
campaigns and their ethical highs and lows. 
</P>
<P>
There is also concern that, in time, TV commercials will evade the media police 
by becoming more sophisticated in their distortions. Kathleen Jamieson, dean of 
the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has 
identified several techniques by which political advertising typically uses 
accurate facts to create distorted or misleading inferences. 
</P>
<P>
One technique invites the audience to add its own inference, as in one famous 
ad for 1968 presidential candidate Hubert H. Humphrey that showed a picture of 
Richard M. Nixon's vice presidential candidate Spiro T. Agnew -- with a 
soundtrack of a man laughing hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
Another is to juxtapose otherwise accurate pictures, narration and words on the 
screen in such a way as to mislead, as occurred in Bush's so-called "revolving 
door" ad during 1988. In this commercial the narrator talked about 
"first-degree murderers" escaping during prison furloughs, while graphics on 
the screen gave the vastly larger number of convicts who escaped on furlough, 
the overwhelming majority of whom were in prison for lesser crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sat through a focus group that saw two different versions of the same 
ad and had two completely different reactions," said Doug Bailey, editor of the 
Political Hotline newsletter and a longtime Republican consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers believe that several elections must pass before the effects of 
the new reporting can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear now, for better or worse, is that the media, with varying 
standards of approach, are moving to assert more conscious influence over the 
political process.

GREENSPAN BOOSTS BUDGET PACT BUT OPPOSITION GROWS; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: DEFEAT WOULD MEAN TROUBLE IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE FED CHIEF SAYS. 
DEMOCRATS JOIN GOP CRITICS. CALLS FROM VOTERS HEAVILY OPPOSE THE

<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Wednesday that there will be 
trouble in the financial markets if the new bipartisan budget accord is 
defeated, but opposition in Congress surged as Democrats joined Republicans in 
opposing key provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before Congress, Greenspan said failure to enact the agreement 
"would have an adverse reaction in the financial markets that could undercut 
our economy." President Bush echoed that, saying: "If we . . . don't get a deal 
. . . we are courting economic disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The developments came as the $500-billion deficit reduction package ran into a 
firestorm of protests from voters Wednesday, raising the risk that it could be 
defeated in the House today, despite intensive lobbying by Bush and top 
congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Rebellious House Republicans, upset over higher taxes, were joined by key 
Democrats, who protested the agreement's provisions for Medicare cuts and new 
tax incentives for wealthy investors on the eve of the first test vote on the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, lawmakers of both parties reported receiving a barrage of 
telephone calls from constituents protesting key elements of the budget-cutting 
package, prompting some lawmakers to reconsider supporting the pact. Many 
reported that opposition to the pact was running as high as 20 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), who opposes the plan, said his phone calls 
were averaging 3 to 1 against it after Bush's televised appeal. "The cuts are 
all flesh and blood, while the deficit is abstract, and (President Bush) didn't 
succeed in changing that" in his speech," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers are scheduled to vote today on a fiscal 1991 congressional budget 
resolution -- the first of a series of such ballots designed to incorporate the 
new budget plan into law. The process is slated to be completed by Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Bush canceled a Republican party fund-raising trip to New England to try to 
round up votes for the agreement, telephoning undecided Republicans and meeting 
with regional reporters to help promote the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although strategists in both parties acknowledged that they still lack the 
votes to pass the resolution in the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) 
said his "intuition" still tells him that the measure will pass. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Budget Director Richard G. Darman asserted that Bush will not accept 
any changes in the agreement, even if he was offered a chance to restore his 
own proposal for a cut in capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we start to change this, it will unravel," Darman told reporters at a 
Washington luncheon Wednesday. "You are either for it or you are not. It's got 
to be a package." 
</P>
<P>
There were these other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) protested 
that some parts of the accord will "muck up the tax code," hinting that his 
panel probably will rewrite much of that part of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski indicated that at the least he will try to change a new incentive 
for investors in start-up firms that have a total stock equity of less than $50 
million, which he said would help only the wealthy at the expense of the poor 
and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), a ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations 
Committee, organized a group of liberal Democrats to oppose the budget 
resolution on grounds that it would give "tax breaks to the rich while socking 
the middle class with new taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Both parties reported that they were still short of the votes needed to 
approve the budget agreement in the House. Republicans acknowledged that they 
were at least 20 votes shy of the necessary 89 needed to provide the GOP's 
House endorsement of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
And Democratic leaders also fell short of nailing down the 130 votes that they 
would have to deliver. "We haven't got the votes yet," one insider said. "The 
outcome is uncertain." Under the terms of the pact, a majority of each party 
must endorse it before it takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders scheduled a third caucus of rank-and-file members just 
before today's scheduled vote in hopes of generating additional support, but 
one of Foley's lieutenants said time seemed to be working against the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most stunning development Wednesday on Capitol Hill seemed to be the 
impact of the deluge of telephone calls that lawmakers received from their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
One supporter of the plan, Rep. Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) received 136 calls in his 
district offices and only seven of them favored it. "It's the gas tax and 
Medicare," an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.), an opponent of the plan, said calls to his office 
were running 80% against, and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland), who endorsed the 
President's speech, said his telephone calls were running almost as heavily 
against the accord. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's comments Wednesday reflected a fear that he has expressed before -- 
that defeat of the accord would plunge the financial markets into turmoil and 
might send the economy into a serious recession. 
</P>
<P>
Those fears have been supported in financial markets in recent days. The dollar 
has been sliding for several weeks, largely because of investors' dismay over 
U.S. economic policies before the budget accord was negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Bush argued to a group of reporters Wednesday that one of the major unheralded 
benefits of approving the accord would be "staving off economic catastrophe." 
He said foreign investors already have balked at financing the huge U.S. budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has been telling both sides for weeks that, if the White House and 
Congress reached a credible accord on how to reduce the budget deficit, the 
financial markets probably would be revitalized and interest rates would go 
down on their own. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has refused to ease monetary policy to help push interest 
rates down artificially, as the Administration has asked, contending that such 
a move would only fuel fears that the Federal Reserve was abandoning the fight 
against inflation and ultimately would send interest rates rising in the 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Wednesday if he believes that interest rates would decline if the current 
accord was approved, he replied without hesitation: "Most certainly." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who previously has been 
urging Greenspan to help push interest rates down artificially, sided with the 
Fed chairman and argued that enacting the budget plan would produce that same 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple," Brady said in a statement late Wednesday: "If Congress passes 
the budget agreement, interest rates will come down. If they don't, interest 
rates will go up." He called the accord "credible and enforceable." 
</P>
<P>
For all the sharp divisions in the House, strategists say prospects in the 
Senate are far brighter. "Compared to the House, our waters are calm -- not 
smooth, but calm," said Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.), one of the original 
budget negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with reporters, Bush said he would encourage lawmakers to make 
him the scapegoat, if necessary, to support the agreement. "Say the President 
encouraged you," he said. "Blame me, because I know what's best for our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Just the same, the vote slated in the House for today appeared likely to be 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"My prediction is that it will pass by one vote -- it's tough going on both 
sides" of the aisle, said Rep. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.). "I don't like it 
at all, but I'm supporting it because there is no credible alternative." 
</P>
<P>
House Democrats from California, who usually support their party's leadership 
on major votes, were against the plan, 13 to 5, at their weekly breakfast. A 
delegation source said he expects as many as 18 of its 27 members to oppose the 
package when the vote is taken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, frictions intensified Wednesday between the White House and House 
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has annoyed the Administration by 
leading a GOP revolt against the accord. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident Wednesday, Bush pointedly snubbed Gingrich when the Georgian 
came to the Executive Mansion for a ceremony celebrating Atlanta's success in 
landing the 1992 summer Olympics. Gingrich shrugged it off, terming the 
President a "tough competitor." 
</P>
<P>
And Darman predicted that the conservative rebellion that Gingrich is leading 
ultimately would prove to be only "a distraction. I do not believe his 
objections will be lethal" to passage of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said Wednesday that he had received 775 calls, 83% of them siding with 
him against the President. 
</P>
<P>
Other offices, although reporting a lower volume of calls than Gingrich, said 
they were running heavily against the agreement, primarily because of its 
Medicare cutbacks and a big increase in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
The office of Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), for example, tallied 86 calls 
against the plan and only six in favor of it by midday Wednesday. "People are 
not just opposed, they're vehemently opposed," said Levine's top aide, William 
Andresen. 
</P>
<P>
Other House members surveyed by The Times reported similar counts. They 
included Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los 
Angeles), Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) said he probably would vote against the 
package because of its cutbacks in Medicare and higher taxes on gasoline and 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
Voting on the package only weeks before the Nov. 6 elections makes it more 
likely that House members, who all stand for reelection every two years, may 
vote against the agreement, congressional sources acknowledged.

THE BATTLE FOR THE BUDGET 
</P>
<P>
Where the major players stand: 
</P>
<P>
BUSH ADMINISTRATION: President Bush stepped up his lobbying. "It is our last, 
best chance to try to get this federal deficit under control. . . . A major 
benefit is short-run -- a staving off of economic catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: Alan Greenspan strongly endorsed the package. 
Although he did not promise to ease credit, he said he expected interest rates 
to fall if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP: House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he expects a 
majority of both parties in the House will vote for the plan today. Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said it would pass if a majority of 
Republicans decide to back Bush. 
</P>
<P>
CHIEF TAX WRITER: Dan Rostenkowski, House Ways and Means Committee chairman, 
complained the budget deal "mucks up the tax code" by providing new tax 
shelters for the wealthy at the expense of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS: The rebellion led by Rep. Newt Gingrich, the 
second-ranking GOP leader, lost some steam. "Gingrich is just a distraction," 
said White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman. "He's got a bright future, 
but not right now." 
</P>
<P>
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS: A group of liberal Democrats led by Rep. David R. Obey 
organized to try to scuttle the agreement. "I really think it stinks," said 
another liberal, Rep. Patricia Schroeder. "It's very unfair to the middle 
class."

VERDICT IS GUILTY IN 2 LIVE CREW'S RAP ALBUM SALE 
</P>

<P>
An all-white jury Wednesday convicted a Ft. Lauderdale record store owner of 
obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
The guilty verdict is believed to be the first conviction in the United States 
of selling an obscene musical work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely stunned," said Bruce Rogow, attorney for the store owner, 
Charles Freeman. "This is going to have a chilling effect on the industry, and 
sends a message to all music stores that they are at risk unless they're 
selling Mantovani." 
</P>
<P>
Record industry executives also expressed shock and vowed to help Freeman 
appeal. "The target (of the prosecution) is a black form of music and the real 
victim is freedom of expression," said Michael Greene, president of the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Thompson, the Coral Gables, Fla., anti-obscenity crusader who 
initiated the national campaign against 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna 
Be" album last January, called the verdict "a victory for women and children." 
</P>
<P>
"This verdict sends a clear message to the record industry that they better 
stop distributing obscene records that degrade women," Thompson said in a 
telephone interview. "If they don't, it will be a short trip up the 
distribution food chain to the boardrooms of the major record labels." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman was arrested by an undercover police officer June 8, two days after a 
U.S. District Court judge ruled that the album violated community obscenity 
standards, thereby banning its sale in three South Florida counties. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman was tried on the misdemeanor charge before a county judge in Ft. 
Lauderdale. He faces a possible one-year jail sentence and a $1,000 fine. 
Sentencing was set for Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Three members of the rap group have also been charged with performing obscene 
material at a June 11 nightclub show in nearby Hollywood. Their trial is set 
for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The album, filled with graphic references to sex acts, has brought renown and 
fortune to the Miami-based rap group. The album, which has sold over 2 million 
copies, has also touched off a national debate over issues of artistic freedom, 
community standards and race. 
</P>
<P>
Luther Campbell, leader of 2 Live Crew, has long contended that he and his 
music have been singled out for prosecution by white judges and law enforcement 
officers who don't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
Additional obscenity prosecutions of record store owners who sold the album, 
including the 140-store Sound Warehouse chain -- the first corporate 
prosecution -- are scheduled to begin in Texas in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a record store owner in Alexander City, Ala., was acquitted of 
obscenity for selling the album. 
</P>
<P>
The Ft. Lauderdale jury returned its verdict after 2 1/2 hours of deliberation. 
Forty-five minutes later, Freeman was back behind the counter of his store, E-C 
Records, in northwest Ft. Lauderdale, and he was angry. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not a jury of my peers," said Freeman, 31, who is black. "They don't 
even know where my store is. (The record) is vulgar, it's nasty, but it's not 
obscene. If you think this music induces you to have sex or something, you got 
to be joking." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's trial opened Monday with prosector Leslie Robson saying: "I urge you 
to listen to the evidence." For the next 90 minutes, the six jurors and one 
alternate sat in stony-faced silence as the bass-heavy rap songs pulsed through 
the packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
To convict Freeman, jurors had to find that the album is obscene, meaning it 
offended community standards, appealed to a morbid interest in sex, and lacked 
artistic merit and value. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of his client, Rogow, a professor of law at Nova University and a 
specialist in first amendment issues, told the jurors, "One person's vulgarity 
is another person's art." He argued that rap music reflected and parodied black 
street language, and clearly had artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
The defense was rebuffed in its efforts to introduce into evidence other rap 
records, including works by the Geto Boys and Ice Cube, sexually explicit 
magazines and a XXX-rated video that Rogow said would give jurors an idea of 
what real pornography is like. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense was able to put on the stand two music critics and a 
psychologist to testify that 2 Live Crew's music was art and not injurious to 
community standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard people tell me that they may put music on to create a mood -- a 
little Johnny Mathis and a little wine," said psychologist Merry S. Haber. "But 
I have never heard anybody say they were turned on by rap music." 
</P>
<P>
Rogow said an appeal of the verdict was likely on several grounds, including 
the judge's instructions to the jury, the inability to present certain 
evidence, and the fact that only one of the 35 persons in the jury pool was 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"This is music from the streets, made by black people," said Rogow. "But to 
this jury of six white people, it came from a foreign country. They were so 
overwhelmed by the words, they couldn't hear anything else. We really have a 
clash of cultures here in terms of age, sex and race." 
</P>
<P>
None of the six jurors who convicted Freeman would comment afterward. But 
alternate Sheryl Salomon said: "I was very offended by (the record), especially 
by the lyrics. But I have to question whether or not there is artistic value. 
It's music, it's still music."

LUNGREN ASSAILS SMITH WITH FEINSTEIN MEMOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Employing Democrat Dianne Feinstein as his source, Republican state attorney 
general candidate Dan Lungren sought to discredit the crime-fighting record of 
his Democratic foe, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, during a rare joint 
televised appearance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, appearing on a KCBS-TV "Newsmakers" taping scheduled to be broadcast 
Sunday, waved in the air Smith's 1986 and 1987 performance reviews from 
then-San Francisco Mayor Feinstein. In the letters, Feinstein, the Democratic 
candidate for governor, stated that Smith's felony conviction rate was lower 
than that in other major metropolitan areas across the state. 
</P>
<P>
"These are annual reviews of the office of Arlo Smith -- and these are her 
words, they are not my words," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to be arrested for a felony anywhere in the state," the former 
five-term congressman added, "the best place to be is Arlo Smith's San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Smith countered that since he became district attorney in 1979, San Francisco's 
crime rate has declined by 25% and the number of convicts committed to state 
prison has more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why peace officers who know best who is effective have supported my 
(candidacy)," said Smith, who has split the state law enforcement community's 
endorsements almost 50-50 with Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Feinstein entered the fray herself. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter faxed to reporters by the Smith campaign, Feinstein said her 
performance reviews of Smith had been written "in the heat of budget battles" 
between the mayor's office and city department heads. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike you," the letter to Lungren continues, "Arlo Smith is a law enforcement 
professional with 36 years of experience prosecuting killers, rapists and drug 
dealers. Arlo Smith has prosecuted death penalty cases at every level of the 
state and federal courts, and won them." 
</P>
<P>
"California needs an attorney general who is an experienced prosecutor," she 
concluded. "This is no time for on the job training for a politician who is 
only qualified for an entry level position in the attorney general's office." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's 1987 letter, based on statistics gathered by the state attorney 
general's office, stated that Smith's office registered yearly conviction rates 
ranging from 56% to 59% from 1983 to 1985 -- about 20% lower than the statewide 
average and more than 25% lower than the average in Los Angeles. The percentage 
of felony case filings in San Francisco that resulted in prison sentences was 
10.7% in 1985 -- just below the state average of 12%, according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 response to the letter, Smith called the statistics "misleading," 
noting that the state itself cautioned that counties vary in the accuracy of 
statistics they report. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates' caustic flap over qualifications highlighted an unusual day in 
which Smith and Lungren taped the only two TV joint appearances they are 
scheduled to make in the Los Angeles media market. 
</P>
<P>
Both 30-minute broadcasts -- the second one was KNBC-TV's "Channel 4 News 
Conference" -- are to be aired Sunday, the same day the first live televised 
debate has been scheduled between Feinstein and her Republican rival, Pete 
Wilson. The only other joint TV appearance between Smith and Lungren this fall 
is planned in San Francisco a week from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
During and after the forums Wednesday, Lungren lashed out at Smith for refusing 
to appear more often with him in public forums. Referring to Smith's campaign, 
he said: "They wanted to do two in one day . . . (and) they want it on TV the 
same day as the gubernatorial (debate). What for? The idea would be to try and 
hide it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is neck-and-neck in the polls with Lungren, countered that the three 
appearances provide "plenty of opportunities to get the issues discussed and 
aired." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's stance is in sharp contrast to the one he took last spring. Then, as a 
decided underdog in the Democratic primary race against Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, Smith agreed to appear four times across the state with 
Lungren in moderator-free, Lincoln-Douglas style sessions. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he criticized Reiner's refusal to participate in head-to-head 
debates, saying: "The public has a right to have information on candidates who 
are seeking the office of attorney general. It can't be done in 30-second 
television shots." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also clashed Wednesday on abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, emphasizing his staunch support of the issue, said he would refuse to 
defend the state in court if legislation were approved to restrict Medi-Cal 
funding for abortions. He said he would also refuse to defend a parental 
consent law limiting teen access to abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Both laws, Smith said, trample on womens' right to privacy guaranteed in the 
state Constitution. "(As attorney general) you are the state's lawyer, you're 
also the people's lawyer," said Smith. "One of those duties is to protect 
constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, a vehement abortion foe, said he considers both types of restrictions 
constitutional and would thus defend them in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The obligation of the attorney general is to represent the interests of the 
state unless there is an absolute obvious conflict (with the Constitution)," 
Lungren said.

LABOR DRIVE MAKES PUSH FOR NATIONAL HEALTH PLAN;

INSURANCE: WORKING MEN, WOMEN TESTIFY ABOUT DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED

Don Slater, a warehouseman who works the graveyard shift at a chocolate 
company, told Wednesday about how his health insurance ran out when an 
on-the-job injury put him out of work for 18 months. He talked about having to 
sell off his cars to feed his family and pay his mortgage. Now -- finally back 
at work -- Slater, 36, is selling his home to pay his debts. 
</P>
<P>
Slater's testimony, delivered haltingly to AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and 
the heads of three of the nation's largest unions, was part of a monthlong, 
eight-city road show of poignancy and politics that organized labor is staging 
to build public support for national health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is not yet focused on a particular solution, although Canada's 
system of tax-financed universal care is the model most often mentioned by 
labor leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 million Americans lack any form of health coverage and an additional 
60 million have inadequate coverage, according to a report issued last week by 
a commission appointed during the Reagan Administration. In three-quarters of 
the families who lack insurance, a family member is working but does not 
receive coverage through his employer. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the San Francisco hearing, held in a small City Hall 
auditorium, heard a single mother with an implanted cardiac pacemaker describe 
the difficulty of having to choose her jobs on the basis of the type of health 
care offered. They heard a Vietnam veteran describe leg injuries he could not 
treat because his employer offered no insurance. They heard Don Perata, the 
chairman of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, speak of diminishing 
county resources in the face of mounting numbers of patients who lack private 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to be Cassandra" in lobbying Congress, Perata said, alluding 
to the daughter of the king of Troy, whose name is associated with prophecies 
of doom. "The people in Washington seem to be the only ones who don't realize 
we're about to embark upon an explosion" of disease caused by inadequate 
treatment, he said. "People are turning on each other" as they fight for 
limited health resources. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times poll conducted in March found that a majority of Americans 
would prefer a health insurance system like that in Canada where all medical 
care is paid through taxes even though doctors practice independently. Surveys 
of employers find strong opposition to this idea. Instead, companies prefer an 
increasingly popular "managed care" system, in which employees are restricted 
to using only a selected group of doctors and hospitals picked by the employer. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders have sought national health insurance for 50 years, and have 
complained about the rising number of employers cutting or eliminating health 
benefits. But what has brought the campaign a sense of urgency was a union 
study released late last year indicating that the central issue in 80% of the 
strikes in the United States is management demands for cuts in employee health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
With national union membership stagnant in comparison to the growing U.S. work 
force, leaders of the 14-million-member AFL-CIO hope to tap into an issue that 
transcends union lines. Last week they began a $3 million series of prime-time 
network television ads urging Congress and President Bush to adopt a form of 
universal health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearing was the third of eight that will be held from Brunswick, 
N.J., to Austin, Tex., by the end of October. Wednesday was also the "national 
action day" planned for months by three-dozen labor and community groups, which 
distributed 5 million "Health Care for All" stickers and coordinated 
demonstrations in a number of cities. 
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, members of 9-to-5, a working-women's organization, demonstrated 
in memory of Linda Williams, a divorced mother with two children. Organizers 
said Williams worked 45 hours a week at three part-time jobs -- none offering 
insurance -- and was turned away by hospitals when she needed triple-bypass 
heart surgery. Publicity helped her finance an operation but subsequently, 
while working a new full-time job and another part-time one, Williams died of a 
heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the notion of universal insurance is made difficult by the 
opposition of the Bush Administration. Health and Human Services Secretary 
Louis W. Sullivan recently said he opposes a national health care program 
similar to Canada's government-financed system. 
</P>
<P>
In California, legislation that would have gradually required employer-paid 
coverage for most workers died last summer when Gov. George Deukmejian 
announced he would veto it. At a health care rally sponsored here by labor 
organizations Wednesday, Democrat Dianne Feinstein said she would sign such a 
bill if elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Wednesday's demonstrations, the health insurance industry -- 
often described by partisans of national insurance as the primary roadblock to 
reform -- issued a statement in Washington saying that it, too, favors changes. 
However, the statement by the Health Insurance Assn. of America stressed the 
importance of a "private/public" effort. 
</P>
<P>
C. John Tupper, president of the American Medical Assn., for decades an 
opponent of national health insurance, testified during Wednesday's hearing 
that his organization wants many of the reforms sought by labor to ensure 
medical treatment for all citizens. However, "given the government's track 
record in failing to provide adequate financing for both Medicaid and Medicare 
. . . we have to wonder if government should be trusted with an even larger 
role on the health-care stage," he said.

RULING MEANS MORE MONEY, MORALE BOOST FOR FEINSTEIN

One judge, one ruling, $2 million at least -- including a $50,000 check from 
comedian Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
That is the boon for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein from 
U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton's ruling last week tossing out campaign 
contribution limits of $1,000 per person, a top adviser says. 
</P>
<P>
Added to this infusion of sorely needed money has been an injection of 
exuberance and spirit -- a renewed confidence by the candidate and her aides 
that on Nov. 6 she will be elected the first woman governor in state history. 
Now, they believe, she will be able to match Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's 
television ads in the final month of the race. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling -- upheld Wednesday by a federal appellate court -- clearly 
has been the single most significant event of the fall gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bonanza, a whole new world," campaign director Bill Carrick said. "Now, 
Chevy Chase can write a $50,000 check." 
</P>
<P>
John Plaxco, campaign finance director, estimated that scrapping the $1,000 
limits and allowing people to donate as much as they want will gain Feinstein 
"$2 million -- at least." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have been coming to us," he said. "We haven't even asked." 
</P>
<P>
One such person was Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
As Chase and Feinstein recounted to intrigued supporters at a $1,000-per-plate 
fund-raising dinner Tuesday night at the Beverly Hilton, the actor telephoned 
the candidate's headquarters out of the blue last Friday, asking to talk to "a 
campaign person" about possibly helping out. 
</P>
<P>
Chase was given a telephone number and told he could call it the next morning. 
When he did, the person who answered was Feinstein's husband, Richard Blum. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Chase told the banquet crowd of about 1,000. "I had 
their home phone and I felt like I had wakened them up. And I got directly to 
Dianne -- and here I am." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no talk of a campaign contribution in the telephone conversation. 
Feinstein only asked Chase to say a few words at the dinner, which already was 
headed toward an $800,000 net even without Chase's supplement. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein picked up the story of the donation after Chase left the microphone, 
announcing: "Believe it or not, he walked in this evening and he wrote a check 
for $50,000." There were gasps, cheers, whistles and loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Chase said in an interview that he and his wife had talked it over and 
decided to write a big check because they like Feinstein's positions on such 
issues as the environment and education. For him, giving to political 
candidates is rare, he emphasized.

"Don't spread the word. Everybody's handing me their cards already," Chase 
said, pulling some from his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Blum said Wednesday, "We had absolutely no idea he was going to give us 50 
cents until the banquet last night." 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the largest donations Feinstein has received since the judge 
junked the contribution limits. But there have been several big ones, aides 
said -- many of them not yet announced. 
</P>
<P>
Hadley Roff, Feinstein's veteran chief of staff, in an interview, disclosed two 
more large donations at a campaign labor rally in San Francisco's Union Square 
Wednesday. He reported that the carpenters union has given Feinstein $150,000 
and the California Teachers Assn. $50,000. It already was announced last week 
that California Highway Patrol officers had donated $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a boost," Roff said of the judge's ruling. "It gives us a sense 
that we're going to be significantly more competitive. It pumps the 
adrenaline." 
</P>
<P>
Said Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers: "It was a shot in the arm for the 
campaign emotionally as well as financially." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Wilson had been outspending Feinstein by roughly 3 to 1 on TV 
commercials, Myers said: 
</P>
<P>
"This campaign has been like an Indiana Jones movie -- a snake bites Dianne on 
the leg, alligators are about to eat her up, then she gets a court ruling and a 
favorable poll. There's a certain energy that comes from getting out of a tight 
situation."

MILITARY CLAIMED KAHOOLAWE FOR BOMBING PRACTICE. NATIVES CALL IT A 'SPIRITUAL

<P>
When Noa Emmett Aluli looks at the dusty, windblown island of Kahoolawe, he 
sees a cultural treasure. Ancient petroglyphs etched on its flanks tell of his 
people's past. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. military trains its sights on Kahoolawe, it sees a target. To the 
soldiers and sailors who bomb and assault its shores, the uninhabited island 
offers a chance to practice war as it is really fought. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Aluli has clung to the dream of stopping the bombing 
and returning Kahoolawe (pronounced Kah-ho-oh-lah-vey) to Hawaii's people. In 
1976, he and a band of friends took matters in their own hands, sailing across 
the choppy channel from Maui to land on a rocky beach. The Navy promptly 
arrested them for trespassing. But the protesters kept coming, even after two 
were lost at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Today Aluli's dream is closer than ever to reality. The National Security 
Council, at the behest of President Bush, is assessing the feasibility of 
ending use of Kahoolawe as a target. The Navy took over the island during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we have the attention of the White House for the first time in 
our efforts to stop the bombing is really a breakthrough," said Davianna 
McGregor, a spokesman for Protect Kahoolawe Ohana, a nonprofit group. "Ohana" 
means "family" in Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
At first blush, the 45-square-mile island seems unlikely to provoke such an 
emotional tug of war. Kahoolawe's battered red dirt swells and cracks in the 
sun. Scrubby mesquite trees provide scant shade. Goats have stripped its 
once-productive ranch land, and erosion has slashed steep ravines in its sides. 
</P>
<P>
But the smallest of the state's eight major islands has become a powerful 
symbol for Hawaiians. What it lacks in foliage, Kahoolawe makes up for in 
history. Ancient fishing shrines stud the coastline. At its summit, early 
Hawaiians studied astronomy and navigation. The entire island is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places, so rich is it in archeological features. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a spiritual center that takes us back to our kupuna (elders)," said 
McGregor. "It has helped the Hawaiian movement find its soul." 
</P>
<P>
Once dismissed as a radical cause, the push to reclaim Kahoolawe has gradually 
moved into Hawaii's mainstream. When the early occupations proved fruitless, 
Aluli sued the secretary of the Navy on environmental, historic and religious 
grounds. The court decision was a milestone for the Ohana. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980 consent decree gives Hawaiians access to the island 10 times a year for 
religious and educational purposes. It limits the shelling to the central third 
of the island, and requires the Navy to preserve historic sites, stem soil 
erosion and help revegetate the island. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, one political leader after another has joined the cause, some with 
dramatic flourish. A few years ago, Maui Mayor Hannibal Tavares planted a flag 
on the island to claim it for his jurisdiction, while a helicopter overhead 
scattered thousands of carnations. 
</P>
<P>
Under its visitation rights, the group has brought about 4,000 people to the 
island. They arrive by boat and wade ashore through the surf, carrying 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
While on the island, the group reverts to traditional ways. Ohana members have 
built a house of wood and thatch that was brought to the island piece by piece. 
They dive for fish and conduct religious ceremonies, offering leaf-wrapped 
gifts of food to Hawaiian gods. 
</P>
<P>
Navy personnel always hover nearby, keeping an eye out for unexploded shells 
that often protrude from the ground. Troops conduct regular ordnance sweeps, 
but more keeps turning up. 
</P>
<P>
While the bombing has been a public relations disaster for the military, the 
Navy is proud of its record in reforestation and protecting archeological 
sites. Officials say they can't give the island up, however, because it offers 
a combination of rough terrain and ocean for which there is no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't other places in Hawaii we can do this type of training," 
said Capt. Gerald Mittendorff, Kahoolawe project officer for the Navy. All four 
branches of the military use the island, operating out of a base camp 
overlooking its best sandy beach. Every other year, they invite Pacific allies 
to join them for exercises. Aware of the controversy, Japan and Australia have 
declined to participate recently, but Canada and South Korea still do.

EDUCATION / OUSTING TOBACCO; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS STAMPING OUT SMOKING WITH ONLY A SPARK OF OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Flagstaff, Ariz., a receptionist for the school district hailed its 
fledgling no-tobacco policy as her best hope for finally kicking cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, a frustrated teacher -- a longtime heavy smoker -- protested no 
longer being allowed to have a cigarette in the faculty lounge but promised to 
comply with his district's new rules. And in the San Juan Unified School 
District near Sacramento, it was the employee groups who pushed for banishing 
tobacco from district buildings, grounds and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
When the 626,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District becomes "tobacco 
free" on Nov. 15 -- banning the use of such products anywhere on district 
property or at school-sponsored events -- it will find plenty of company, 
especially among suburban or small-town districts. 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE OPPOSITION: In the last two or three years, rules aimed at achieving 
smoke-free elementary and secondary campuses have been enacted from Orlando, 
Fla., to Simi Valley, Calif. -- with only modest pockets of opposition from 
district employees and practically none from parents who liked to smoke at 
football games and other school-sponsored events. Even the tobacco industry, 
which usually mobilizes at the first whiff of anti-smoking proposals, has 
stayed out of the way of campaigns to ban its products at schools. 
</P>
<P>
The campaigns are aided by mounting medical evidence of tobacco's serious 
health effects, including from so-called second-hand smoke, and by indications 
that tobacco is a "gateway" substance that can start the youngest smokers down 
the road to illegal drug use. They are also helped by social pressure against 
smoking and by a desire to provide better role models for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey last year by the National School Boards Assn., 17% of 
school districts nationwide banned tobacco use entirely, contrasted with just 
2% in 1986. New Jersey, Kansas, Utah and New Hampshire have required that all 
their schools be tobacco-free, to be joined next year by Washington state, an 
official of the Tobacco Free America Project said. The project is run by the 
American Cancer Society, the American Heart Assn. and the American Lung Assn., 
the agencies that are spearheading the drive to boot tobacco off campus. 
</P>
<P>
School tobacco bans "are definitely increasing . . . this is the easiest, most 
obvious move to make," said Diane Maple of the Lung Assn., which, like its two 
sister agencies, offers advice and stop-smoking programs to school boards 
considering such bans. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, schools are about children, and who can argue about that?" Maple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRY QUIET: The Tobacco Institute, which has battled regulations from 
restaurants to airliners on grounds that they trample the rights of smokers, is 
conspicuously absent from school board debates. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't (lobby school boards) because children are involved," said Tobacco 
Institute spokesman Thomas Lauria, who denounced the comprehensive bans on 
campus tobacco use for "treating teachers like children." Nonetheless, the 
industry, fighting accusations that it is trying to recruit new smokers, is 
"not going to go on record to defend policies that affect children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the school bans have been enacted after communitywide campaigns, are 
accompanied by stop-smoking help and have either several months' lead time 
before enforcement or have been phased in slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando's 103,000-student Orange County Public Schools led the state of Florida 
when it enacted its ban in February, 1989, but the policy will not take full 
effect until next fall, when new teachers union contracts are in place, 
district spokeswoman Diane Taylor said. So far, the bans do not appear to have 
led any of the districts that pioneered them into stormy legal waters. 
</P>
<P>
RULE OF REASON: Most districts said they try to be reasonable about 
enforcement. As one California superintendent put it: "We're not arresting the 
parent who steps behind the bleachers and lights up at a football game." 
</P>
<P>
In Flagstaff, whose tobacco-free policy grew from discontent over the 
smoke-laden faculty lounges that also doubled as staff workrooms, Supt. Bill 
Williams said compliance is generally good. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying not to be obnoxious about it, and we are as soft in our approach 
as (the few backsliding smokers) allow us to be." 
</P>
<P>
Allan Jacobs, Simi Valley's associate superintendent, said the district's 
policy has more pluses than minuses. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have some teachers who sit in their cars or go across the street to 
smoke," Jacobs said, "but it's really minimal."

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and 
an adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited the Mideast to 
discuss with regional leaders possible solutions to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
More than 900,000 foreigners have fled Iraq and Kuwait so far, and another 2 
million may leave in the future, the U.S. said. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Noor of Jordan said her country has continued to accept oil from Iraq 
despite the international embargo because a total cutoff would cripple Jordan. 
She appealed for economic aid for her nation. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reported to have made his first visit to 
Kuwait since his troops overran the country on Aug. 2. The Iraqi news agency 
said he met with troops and military commanders and went on a walking tour of 
Kuwait city. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and allied nations will begin joint military operations, 
ending more than a month of relative isolation, military officials said. The 
combined operations are designed to overcome problems associated with 
incompatible equipment and communications systems.

DIPLOMACY: SOVIETS SEEK A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE CRISIS. FRANCE'S PRESIDENT 
HEADS FOR THE REGION TO REVIEW TROOPS.

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent his top foreign policy adviser to 
the Middle East on Wednesday to explore with Arab leaders the possibility of a 
peaceful resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of Gorbachev's policy-making Presidential Council 
and one of his closest advisers, is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad today with a 
message from the Soviet leader for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Soviet spokesmen nor the official news agency Tass disclosed the 
contents of the message to Hussein. However, well-informed Soviet specialists 
on the Middle East said they believe Gorbachev is suggesting ways out of the 
deadlock through negotiations and warning Iraq that, if it did not seize this 
opportunity, it risked military action against it. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov's mission follows President Bush's cautious suggestion Monday that a 
diplomatic solution of the gulf crisis could, as French President Francois 
Mitterrand had urged last week, open the way for a broader peace in the Middle 
East, including a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein earlier praised the "positive tone" of Mitterrand's proposal, while 
ignoring the fact that it took as a basis Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. Soviet 
officials warmly endorsed Mitterrand's comments. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand himself headed to the region Wednesday to review French troops who 
are part of the multinational force deployed against Iraq. From Abu Dhabi, he 
is to board a French frigate to meet with French regional commanders today. 
Later today, he is to travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Fahd and talk 
with more troops. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq offered to release all French hostages, apparently in response 
to Mitterrand's peace proposal. Nine French citizens previously held hostage in 
Iraq were flown to Amman, Jordan, and were headed for Paris late Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy that I have been released, but a lot of people remain in Iraq 
and Kuwait," Jean-Yves Bobin, who had been detained in Kuwait, told reporters. 
"We hope they can be freed soon and that all things will develop toward a 
peaceful solution." 
</P>
<P>
Gilles Munier, chairman of the French-Iraqi Friendship Assn., a private group 
that secured the release of the nine, said Iraqi officials in Baghdad told him 
they are willing "to release all French hostages if a top official from the 
(French) government or opposition goes to Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Moscow said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze coordinated 
the surprise Soviet mission with U.S. and other Western diplomatic efforts. He 
is in New York meeting with other diplomats at the United Nations General 
Assembly. Bush met with Shevardnadze this week, and Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III has met with him almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling first to Amman, Jordan's capital, Primakov met Wednesday with King 
Hussein to review the two-month-old crisis and what a Radio Moscow commentator 
described as "avenues of approach," ideally through the United Nations, to a 
peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"The two men expressed anxiety over the danger of armed clashes in the gulf and 
the need for a political settlement," Tass said, reporting Primakov's meeting 
with King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov later met with Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, who like King Hussein put forward his own peace plan several 
weeks ago and has maintained contacts with Baghdad through the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect a lot from my meetings here before my visit to Baghdad," Primakov, a 
leading Soviet specialist on the Middle East, said before meeting Arafat. "I 
need some advice." 
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to fly to Baghdad today, according to Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, the Soviet Union has condemned Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and 
has supported all the U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the immediate 
withdrawal of Iraqi forces and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty, 
independence and territorial integrity. But at the same time, Moscow has kept 
its contacts with Baghdad, once a key Soviet ally in the region and a major 
arms customer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a relationship that goes back 30 years. Let's see what we can do with 
it," a Soviet Foreign Ministry official commented. "We can still approach and 
talk with Hussein, and we hope that he will consider our president's message 
very soberly." 
</P>
<P>
Primakov is also expected to press for the release of more than 1,100 Soviet 
specialists, mostly oil field workers, construction personnel and engineers, 
whose departure is being delayed by Iraq even although their employment 
contracts are finished. 
</P>
<P>
To the Soviet Union, which still has 5,174 specialists in Iraq, the workers are 
looking increasingly like hostages whose presence might be used, as some 
Western and Japanese men now are, to deter attacks on strategic military and 
economic installations. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them out," a senior Communist Party official said Wednesday in Moscow. 
"We want them all out, and we want them out now. . . . Saddam Hussein will be 
left in no doubt about our seriousness on this whole matter." 
</P>
<P>
In what Tass described as an unrelated development, the Defense Ministry 
announced that its newest guided missile cruiser, the Chervona Ukraina, and a 
new destroyer will pass through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea today. 
</P>
<P>
The ships are en route to Vladivostok in the Far East to join the Soviet 
Pacific fleet and will not remain in the area of the Persian Gulf, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu met in Cairo with Egyptian 
Prime Minister Atef Sedki as Egyptian newspapers reported that Tokyo has 
pledged $600 million in aid and loans to nations such as Egypt, Jordan and 
Turkey that which have suffered economically because of the gulf crisis. As 
part of his five-nation tour, Kaifu later flew to Amman, where a spokesman said 
he might meet with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
In coordinating Primakov's trip with Baker and other Western foreign ministers, 
Shevardnadze had reiterated the Soviet commitment to Security Council 
resolutions demanding Iraq's immediate withdrawal from Kuwait as the only basis 
for a political resolution, officials in Moscow said. 
</P>
<P>
With the full restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty, however, the Soviet Union 
believes that most of the original issues could be resolved through 
negotiations or mediation and that the overall impetus could be carried over to 
other Middle East issues, including the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Shevardnadze has continued to hold out the possibility, of military 
action -- with Soviet participation -- under U.N. auspices if the current 
economic sanctions and blockade of Iraq do not work.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze announced an "agreement in principle" Wednesday on a treaty 
slashing the numbers of tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement still needs the approval of Washington's 15 North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization allies and Moscow's five remaining Warsaw Pact allies, but Baker 
said he hopes the treaty will be ready for signature next month at a European 
summit meeting in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze refused to divulge details of the agreement in advance 
of presentation to allied nations. But Baker said the pact will result in the 
destruction of "a significant amount of armaments." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said that the emerging treaty will reduce Warsaw Pact 
weaponry by about 60%, eliminating more than 100,000 weapons, including more 
than 40,000 tanks. It will reduce NATO's substantially smaller arsenal by about 
10%, or 15,000 weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Conventional Forces in Europe talks, which began in Vienna on March 8, 
1989, are technically between the member nations of the rival military 
alliances. However, it is inconceivable that either NATO or the Warsaw Pact 
would reject an agreement that was acceptable to both Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
When the negotiations began last year, the Warsaw Pact consisted of the Soviet 
Union and six Communist-governed nations that followed Moscow's lead in foreign 
policy and military planning. Now, the size of the pact has shrunk with the 
disappearance of East Germany. Of the remaining nations, three -- Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia and Poland -- have jettisoned communism completely and two -- 
Bulgaria and Romania -- have ousted old-line Communist dictators. 
</P>
<P>
"So far as U.S.-Soviet discussions are concerned, we have been able to reach 
mutual understanding on all major issues," Shevardnadze said. "I am sure our 
allies will be able to agree with us." 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze spent most of their six-hour meeting at the headquarters 
of the Soviet U.N. Mission on completing the conventional weapons talks. 
However, Shevardnadze said they also made "substantial progress" toward a new 
agreement slashing the superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Baker flew back to Washington late Wednesday but he said he might return to New 
York on Friday to continue talks on a strategic arms reduction treaty before 
Shevardnadze returns to Moscow this weekend. President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have set a goal of completing the nuclear 
weapons treaty before the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Baker said the two sides are on a "very short time leash" concerning the 
conventional weapons talks. The United States has said that it will not attend 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation summit meeting, scheduled for Paris 
on Nov. 19-21, unless a conventional arms pact is ready to be signed there. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the most significant issues in the conventional arms talks were settled 
earlier. For instance, the two sides agreed to limit the army of reunified 
Germany to 370,000 men, down from 600,000 just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The pact will not impose manpower limits on any other armies, because the 
United States and the Soviet Union were unable to agree on ceilings for U.S. 
troops after the Soviets agreed, in talks with their allies, to withdraw all 
Soviet soldiers from Eastern Europe within four years. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said it is still possible that glitches in the formal drafting process 
could upset the agreement, but he said that was unlikely. Shevardnadze said he 
and Baker agreed to all remaining matters relating to aircraft, which had been 
the final sticking point, with the exception of a minor issue relating to 
helicopters. He predicted that lower-level negotiators would straighten out 
that problem without requiring additional action by the foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that the question of (Soviet) land-based naval aircraft, which was 
one of the real sticking points, would be handled by a politically binding 
declaration" outside of the formal language of the treaty, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither Baker nor Shevardnadze would discuss details of the final 
negotiations, Shevardnadze said with a smile: "Of course, the Soviet Union made 
all of the main concessions."

<P>
President Bush staged his own celebration of German unification on Wednesday, 
congratulating Chancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone and proclaiming 
"German-American Day" at a Rose Garden ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, it is the wall that lies in ruins and our eyes open on a new world of 
hope," Bush told an audience of German-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called the remnants of the Berlin Wall "a ragged monument in brick and 
barbed wire" that serves as "proof that no wall can ever crush a nation's 
soul." 
</P>
<P>
"Dreams sometimes do come true. Germany is united. Germany is free," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
From elsewhere around the world congratulations were showered on Germany for 
its rebirth as a united country after 45 years of division. 
</P>
<P>
But many references to the previous experience with Germany as the dominant 
power in Europe showed that the past is still not quite forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, gripped by memories of the Nazi Holocaust, greeted German unification 
somberly, with one newspaper calling it an insult. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he was disappointed that the unity agreement 
made no mention of wartime Germany's slaughter of 6 million Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's adviser, Avi Pazner, said that a message from Kohl, 
delivered in Jerusalem by the German charge d'affaires, "stressed the united 
Germany's historical commitment to the Jewish people and the state of Israel . 
. . a result of the crimes against the Jewish people by Nazi Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Pazner said Israel had mixed feelings about reunification. He said Lichter's 
meeting with the Polish-born Shamir, whose family was wiped out by the Nazis, 
took place in a "reflective mood." 
</P>
<P>
The English-language Jerusalem Post said memories of the wartime genocide 
against Jews will never fade. 
</P>
<P>
"And to many, the rise of a super-Germany less than 50 years after the 
Holocaust is not only dangerous but an insult to historic justice," the 
conservative daily said. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute to the "peaceful 
and worthy solution of the 'German issue.' " 
</P>
<P>
He cited "all those in my country and in your country who, overcoming sorrows, 
remembering losses and honoring the dead, did not yield to prejudice and 
fears." 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, NATO held a special meeting Wednesday to mark German 
reunification, a time of "undiminished rejoicing," and thanked the Soviets for 
agreeing to united Germany's membership in the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we put nearly half a century of confrontation and frustration behind 
us," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner told the 16 Atlantic Alliance 
ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
President Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, the first country invaded by the 
Nazis, wrote in a letter to German President Richard von Weizsaecker: "In this 
historic moment for the German nation, I am convinced that united Germany will 
not disappoint the trust of the world, and especially of its neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel called unification "the final end to the 
war. . . . The unnatural division of Germany becomes a matter of the past, as 
does the division of our continent." 
</P>
<P>
"The desperation and scars cannot be erased from our minds, but it is necessary 
and possible to overcome them," Havel added in a statement issued in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
While most commentaries looked back to the Nazi past, in Hungary the former 
Communist daily Nepszabadsag saw a wider significance in the death of the 
German Democratic Republic, the former East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The GDR was the socialist state par excellence, the country on whose existence 
the viability of the socialist system hinged," it said. "So the disappearance 
of the GDR also means a symbolic goodby to the phenomenon of European 
communism."

CHIEF OF EAST'S FEARED SECRET POLICE ARRESTED HOURS AFTER REUNIFICATION

Authorities arrested the last chief of East Germany's spy network on espionage 
charges Wednesday in Berlin, a federal prosecutor's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Walter Grossmann, coming hours after the two Germanys were 
united, backs up promises by prosecutors that they intend to track down agents 
of East Germany's former Communist government and pursue espionage cases. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the Hamburg-based newspaper Bild reported that longtime spy 
chief Markus Wolf had probably fled to the Soviet Union. Grossmann replaced 
Wolf in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The federal prosecutor's chief spokesman, Hans-Juergen Foerster, said Grossmann 
was arrested at his home in eastern Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmann will be taken to Karlsruhe, the judicial center of Germany, where a 
decision will be made on whether to keep him in custody, Foerster said in an 
interview. Foerster said he was being held on espionage charges. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany disbanded the notorious Stasi state police agency earlier this 
year after a peaceful revolution ousted hard-line Communist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's chief prosecutor, Alexander von Stahl, said Grossmann had been in 
charge of the Stasi espionage department, which made him "one of the main 
delinquents" on a list of 50 people who are accused of spying against West 
Germany.

2 U.S. MARINES FACE ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES AFTER VEHICLE INJURES STRIKER

Philippine police filed attempted murder charges Wednesday against two U.S. 
Marines whose military vehicle hit a barricade set up by strikers at Clark Air 
Base and slightly injured one worker. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer said that Marine Sgt. David Akers and Cpl. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Motler also were charged with disrupting a peaceful meeting. The hometowns 
of the two were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were filed with the government prosecutor's office which, with 
sufficient evidence, could elevate the case to a trial court. The officer did 
not say what sentences the Marines could receive if they are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Clark authorities said they were unaware of the charges and declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, eight U.S. Marine vehicles and their Philippine air force jeep 
escort were passing through the gate when the second vehicle in the convoy 
accidentally hit a wooden barricade. 
</P>
<P>
Pieces of the barricade hit a striker, one of several dozen picketers guarding 
a gate at Clark, bruising him in the back, Clark spokesmen and police said. 
Clark is 50 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military authorities said the incident was an accident and apologized. 
</P>
<P>
But union officials called it a provocation against Filipino workers whose 
strike began Sunday at Clark and five other U.S. facilities over wage 
increases. The strikers contend that the United States has violated a bilateral 
agreement covering Filipino employees that foresees salary increases based on a 
survey of 35 Philippine firms. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has placed a 3% cap on pay increases for federal employees, 
including those oversees, but the recent wage survey suggested an 18% increase.

Thousands of supporters of Lebanon's defiant Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, vowing to 
die defending him, disrupted the funeral of demonstrators who were among 25 
killed while protesting a blockade of his territory in Beirut. The open-air 
service for six of Aoun's followers, who had taken part in the candle-lit 
protest march Monday night, was repeatedly drowned out by chants against 
leading Roman Catholic and Maronite churchmen who failed to attend. Aoun has 
been locked in a power struggle with President Elias Hrawi, whom Aoun refuses 
to recognize.

GALLERY DIRECTOR DEFENDS EXHIBIT OF EROTIC PHOTOS

The art gallery director who is on trial for showing homoerotic photos by 
Robert Mapplethorpe testified in his own defense Wednesday that he never 
wavered in his commitment to display the works. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Barrie, on trial with the Contemporary Arts Center on obscenity charges, 
said he and the gallery's board had talked about the controversy that an 
exhibit of the photos had caused in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The government-supported showing of Mapplethorpe's photos was canceled last 
year in Washington amid a debate over federal funding of art. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barrie said the gallery's board strongly supported going ahead with 
the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an exhibition of high quality. It had been seen in other cities and 
was by a well-known artist," Barrie testified under questioning by his lawyer 
in Hamilton County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Seven photographs in the 175-photo exhibit, "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect 
Moment," are at the center of the trial. Five show graphic sex acts involving 
men, and two show children whose genitals are exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by assistant city prosecutor Frank Prouty, Barrie 
restated the gallery's commitment to displaying the photos. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had every right and every reason to bring this exhibition to this 
city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prouty showed Barrie Mapplethorpe's five photographs of explicit sex acts and 
asked Barrie to comment on them. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew about light. He knew about shadow . . . . As difficult as the subject 
matter may be, you see the ability of the man working through. He was brilliant 
with a camera," Barrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David Albanese told the jury to expect to get the case today.

Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) met privately with the Senate Ethics Committee on 
Wednesday and said he thoroughly discussed all aspects of his assistance for 
Charles H. Keating Jr. while the businessman's savings and loan was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn, one of five senators who intervened with regulators for Keating and also 
accepted political donations from him, met with the committee in private for 2 
1/2 hours. He refused to disclose the substance of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"I survived," he said. "I appreciated very much the fact that the committee 
would take the time to discuss this whole issue with me, which we did. There 
was adequate time to present everything." 
</P>
<P>
The committee's vice chairman, Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), said no decision 
on Glenn's case had been made. 
</P>
<P>
The senators, appearing individually at closed hearings this week and next, 
will explain their intervention with U.S. banking regulators and their 
acceptance of a total of $1.3 million in political donations from Keating and 
his associates. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources have said committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett 
recommended that cases be dismissed against Glenn and John McCain of Arizona, 
the only Republican among the five. McCain is to appear today. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member committee has not acted on Bennett's recommendation or on his 
conclusion that the panel should proceed with cases against Democratic Sens. 
Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The panel has the authority to rebuke by letter any senator found in violation 
of standards of conduct, or it could recommend full Senate sanctions of censure 
or expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators had already concluded that Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan of Irvine, Calif., was heading toward failure when the senators held two 
crucial meetings with the banking regulators in April, 1987. The thrift was not 
seized by the government until April, 1989.

Richard T. Silberman, sentenced last week to 46 months in federal prison for 
his role in a money-laundering scheme, was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine amid 
disclosure that the once-wealthy San Diego financier owes more than $1.5 
million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Silberman's whopping debts, which total at least $2.1 million, U.S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving imposed the fine because he was not convinced 
Silberman was unable to pay a fine required under rigid new federal sentencing 
guidelines, according to court documents. "We are satisfied with the judge's 
ruling and I think this closes the book on Richard Silberman," said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder.

MEDI-CAL DENTAL PROGRAM CRITICIZED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge ruled that Medi-Cal patients have been denied adequate access 
to dental care and ordered Kenneth W. Kizer, state health services director, to 
devise a plan for getting more dentists to participate in the program. In 
deciding on a suit brought on behalf of all Medi-Cal recipients, the state 
federal health care program for the poor, U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence K. 
Karlton concluded that "only 12.5% of active dentists (were) accepting new 
(Medi-Cal) patients," a level that falls "dismally below" federal requirements. 
Karlton's ruling was considered likely to require the state to increase 
payments for dental services, reduce paper work and, perhaps, open dental 
clinics in counties with few participating dentists.

LYNWOOD PANEL WILL REVIEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT DEPUTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has created a law enforcement review board to investigate the 
activities of sheriff's deputies in reaction to a federal class-action lawsuit 
filed recently by civil rights attorneys against the local sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-1 vote Tuesday, the council formed the city's Law Enforcement Advisory 
and Review Board at the suggestion of acting Mayor Paul H. Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said the board will receive complaints about deputies from citizens, 
conduct hearings and hold informational workshops on police service. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no entity to conduct formal investigations," he said. "The time is now 
for us to form a body where citizens can feel comfortable expressing their 
complaints" about deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, what happens is a citizen's complaint is made to the Sheriff's 
Department, and we never hear about it. The case is lost in the shuffle. We 
need to know what happens." 
</P>
<P>
It will take about a month to work out specifics on how the board will work, 
Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal lawsuit filed last month accused deputies of engaging in wanton 
shootings, beatings and excessive force while working out of the Lynwood 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by attorneys representing 81 plaintiffs, named as defendants 
Sheriff Sherman Block, Los Angeles County, the city, the commander of the 
Lynwood station, Atty Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
While the council voted to create the review board, two of its members 
expressed doubt about how the council will control board members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that a board like this might feel it can just bash the Sheriff's 
Department," Councilwoman Evelyn Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she voted for the board's creation, along with Richards and Councilman 
Armando Rea. Mayor Robert Henning was absent, attending a Houston transit 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Louis J. Heine, who voted against the board, said city officials 
should discuss a review board with Block and other department representatives 
before forming one. 
</P>
<P>
Heine said City Manager Charles Gomez meets with the Sheriff's Department 
regularly to discuss operations at Lynwood station, from which about 150 sworn 
deputies cover 7.6 square miles in the city and the unincorporated county area 
of East Compton and Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
The station's acting commander, Lt. Mark A. Thompson, said the department 
regularly meets with council members to discuss citizens' complaints. He would 
not comment further on the review board. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comment from the public during the council debate, but after the 
meeting residents generally disagreed with the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Depner said he thought the review board does "not make sense. It's just 
another bureaucracy. The council has the power to hire the sheriff, and it can 
fire the department if it is dissatisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Acting Mayor Richards said the review board will probably consist of five 
members appointed by the council and have the authority to conduct 
"fact-finding investigations" and hold seminars describing police service in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
When the suit was filed Sept. 25, city officials and residents expressed 
surprise and defended the department's overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime city activist Bennie Miranda said complaints were about deputies 
driving too fast or orally abusing residents. He said he was not aware of any 
physical abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Both Miranda and Mayor Henning accused attorneys who filed the suit of 
"staging" the complaints to get media attention. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said: "We're not going to relinquish control of our community to a 
handful of people and their attorneys who are just wanting to make a quick 
buck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND A 47-page lawsuit was filed in federal court Sept. 25 accusing 22 
deputies of a wave of beatings, shootings and other instances of excessive 
force during three months early this year. George V. Denny III, the lead 
counsel among 18 attorneys representing 81 plaintiffs, said the suit is 
necessary because the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office 
failed to discipline deputies. Lynwood has contracted with the department for 
police services since 1977. The ethnic makeup of the blue-collar community of 
55,000 is mostly black and Latino.

COURT CLEARS CASINO MANAGER AND PARTNERS; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: GEORGE G. HARDIE AND HIS FINANCIAL PARTNERS WILL REGAIN OWNERSHIP 
RIGHTS TO THE PROFITABLE BICYCLE CLUB IN BELL GARDENS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poker magnate and Bicycle Club general manager George G. Hardie and the 
partners in his corporation have been cleared by federal authorities of 
wrongdoing in a racketeering and money laundering scheme in which $12 million 
in drug profits was invested in the giant card club. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie and his partners in Park Place Associates, which owns 35% of the Bicycle 
Club, will now regain ownership rights to their share of the club, a highly 
profitable card casino estimated to be worth $150 million, and the largest 
asset ever seized by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 65% of the club, owned by LCP Associates, is still held in trust 
by the city of Bell Gardens, and its profits remain frozen in a federal 
account. LCP Associates is trying to persuade federal prosecutors in a federal 
court action in Florida that it also did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge Norman C. Roettger Jr. last month began hearing testimony in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., from federal authorities who contend that the partners of LCP 
Associates knew that laundered drug profits were used to build the club and 
should therefore forfeit their interest in it. Partners in LCP Associates, 
which include former California Assemblyman David C. Pierson, Westside banker 
M. Dale Lyons and Juliann Coyne, a Studio City consultant, said they did not 
know the money with which they financed the club was laundered drug money. 
</P>
<P>
The order exonerating Hardie's Park Place Associates, signed Sept. 12 and 
released last week by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of 
Florida, states that "PPA (Park Place Associates) was unaware of any criminal 
activity concerning the source of any funds used or received in connection with 
the construction of the Bell Gardens Bicycle Club, or of any wrongdoing or 
taint associated with any such funds." 
</P>
<P>
Hardie said he is relieved Park Place Associates has been vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are innocent third parties, there have been enormous legal expenses 
and, quite frankly, a concern whether justice would prevail. . . . There is 
always going to be some baggage that I will have to carry around just because I 
made a poor choice of a financial partner." 
</P>
<P>
Hardie said Park Place Associates has spent about $500,000 in legal fees over 
the last three years. He said the lengthy investigation and the publicity that 
surrounded it have prevented him from running for mayor of Cathedral City, 
where he is a councilman, cost him employees and hampered business deals. 
</P>
<P>
The money-laundering scheme came to light three years ago when federal 
authorities indicted several men, including LCP Associates partner Michael 
Gilbert, on racketeering charges stemming from a money laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The trial revealed that profits from the smuggling operation were laundered by 
Michael Gilbert and his father, late Los Angeles developer and UCLA booster 
Samuel Gilbert, who funneled the money through LCP Associates and several other 
dummy corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Gilbert died before the indictment could be handed down, but Michael 
Gilbert was convicted of racketeering charges earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Since then government prosecutors and attorneys representing LCP Associates 
have been gathering evidence for a hearing now under way that will determine 
whether LCP Associates knew of the laundering operation and whether its share 
of the casino should be forfeited to the government. 
</P>
<P>
LCP Associates now must prove to federal Judge Roettger that it, like Park 
Place Associates, is an innocent third party. If Roettger determines that LCP 
Associates was, in fact, duped by Michael Gilbert and his father, then its 
rights as majority owner will be restored. If not, said Park Place Associates 
attorney James Clark, then LCP must forfeit its share to the government. 
</P>
<P>
LCP Associates has been investigated by federal prosecutors because it arranged 
all the financing for construction of the Bicycle Club. Federal authorities 
have argued that LCP Associates knew or should have known that almost half of 
the $25 million used to build the Bicycle Club came from a marijuana smuggling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing of LCP Associates is expected to conclude in late November 
unless a settlement is reached, Hardie said.

<P>
BINGO IS OUTLAWED AFTER 7 1/2 YEARS OF CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ordinance outlawing bingo in Cudahy received final approval from the City 
Council this week and will go into effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 Monday night to repeal a 1983 ordinance that allowed 
bingo for charitable purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of how the games should be played has become too politicized, city 
officials said. Councilman John Robertson voted against the repeal. 
</P>
<P>
Currently no organization is sponsoring bingo games in Cudahy, and city leaders 
said that although several attempts have been made to start new games, none 
have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council, City Manager Jack Joseph said the intent of the 
original bingo ordinance that allowed games as fund-raising activities for 
nonprofit organizations had been undermined. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance has been used to justify attempts to institute large commercial 
bingo establishments," Joseph told the council. "Members of organizations 
seeking to play bingo have on two or three occasions launched recall drives 
against City Council members." 
</P>
<P>
In short, Joseph said, "the 7 1/2-year history of bingo in the city of Cudahy 
has been one of controversy, political maneuvering and general unpleasantness, 
but no bingo."

SCHOOL BOARD VACANCY TO BE FILLED BY APPOINTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A vacant seat on the nine-member Board of Education of the Downey Unified 
School District will be filled by appointment, a district official announced 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Area 5 seat was vacated by veteran board member Walter S. Temple, who 
resigned Sept. 30 because he moved out of the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for the post will be accepted until Oct. 24. To be eligible, 
candidates must be at least 18 years old, registered to vote in Los Angeles 
County, and residents of the district's Area 5. Most of Area 5 is south of 
Firestone Boulevard, between Rives Avenue and Lakewood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The board is expected to fill the vacancy before the end of November. The 
appointment will be for one year, until the district's next regular election in 
November, 1991.

BUILDERS CRITICIZE PROPOSED STANDARDS AS TOO RESTRICTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposed development standards are so restrictive that they would drive away 
business people trying to bring commerce to Whittier, said a handful of 
developers and merchants at a public hearing Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Not every building owner is trying to get away with something," said Philip 
Singerman, vice president of Norms Restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Singerman and architect Victor Newlove arrived with their site plan for their 
proposed Whittier Boulevard restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The new standards would "make it difficult for us to build this building," 
Newlove said. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the hearing was to receive public comment on regulations that, 
if passed, would take effect at the Oct. 15 conclusion of a five-month 
moratorium on commercial developments of one acre or less. The moratorium was 
aimed specifically at mini-malls. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members Bob Henderson and Helen McKenna-Rahder have maintained 
that poorly planned mini-malls destroy neighborhood character and lead to 
congestion and high vacancy rates. Both praised staff work on the new 
standards, which will be amended based on council and public concerns expressed 
at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Woehrmann said some proposed guidelines would penalize 
developers who own corner lots and that other standards were so inflexible that 
they would short-circuit imaginative building design.

<P>
Tucker was serving his third mayoral term when he died of cancer Monday at 66. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Friday from noon to 2 p.m. in Civic Center 
Plaza outside the chambers. The body will lie in state today from 3 to 8 p.m.

Burial will be at Angeles Abbey in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in the mayor's memory to a 
scholarship fund created by his family. Those who wish to donate to the fund 
may call 285-3770. The mayor is survived by his wife, Martha; two daughters, 
Keta and Camille, and two sons, Walter and Kenneth. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker came to the city in 1957 and set up a dental practice, which he 
maintained until he became ill this year. 
</P>
<P>
He entered politics in 1967, winning election as a school trustee that year. In 
1973 he won a council seat but was later defeated in his first mayoral bid. 
When he ran again in 1981, he was elected mayor.

STRICTER SCHOOL DRESS CODE WEIGHED; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA OFFICIALS LOOK FOR WAYS TO PREVENT CONFRONTATIONS ON 
CAMPUS. 
</P>

<P>
Officials in the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District are re-examining an 
8-year-old clothing and grooming policy for ways to limit gang dress to reduce 
gang confrontations at school. 
</P>
<P>
The officials hope a stricter dress code will prevent students from identifying 
one another as gang members on their way to and from school and in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The district's dress code requires students to be neat, clean and appropriately 
dressed for school activities. The changes under consideration would ban 
specific types of clothing associated with area gangs. Although gang fashion 
varies, one common style is the hair net or bandana, oversized pants, and 
untucked shirt with only the top button buttoned. The other extreme is black 
shoes, carefully ironed pants and a white T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
The school board study arose after six gang-related killings occurred in the 
Norwalk area in recent months, including one that claimed the life of a 
12-year-old boy in late August. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk had about 2,000 gang members, according to a Sheriff's Department 
estimate last year. 
</P>
<P>
All schools in the district already have some form of dress guidelines, said 
Chris Roubidoux, director of elementary education. Some of them, for example, 
prohibit the use of caps and hair nets. 
</P>
<P>
At a board meeting Monday, members suggested ways to focus the study. President 
William A. White suggested helping families adjust to the new look expected of 
their children. Board member Lupe Flores-McClintock requested information on 
other school districts that have dress codes, and their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, the ABC Unified School District approved a dress code to 
protect students from gangs both on and off school grounds. The Long Beach 
Unified School District also has restrictions on gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
But Elias Galvan, director of secondary education in the Norwalk-La Mirada 
district, cautioned that a dress code only "begins to address the problem" of 
gang violence. "Communicating with youngsters and their parents is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Discussion with the school board, staff, parents and the community is expected 
to continue through this month, and the board is expected to draft a policy in 
November. The code, if approved, would take effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, David Plaza spoke on the Norwalk Alternatives to Gangs 
Program, a new 15-week curriculum geared to fourth-graders. Plaza, who will 
teach the program, said research has shown the fourth grade to be the most 
vulnerable age when it comes to gang influence. "By the fifth and sixth grade, 
(they have) already experimented with gangs and drugs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The program is due to start in Moffitt, Nottingham and Edmondson elementary 
schools the week of Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Also discussed was a drug and alcohol prevention program for fourth-graders 
that is due to go to the classrooms in January.

The Canyon Inn, 6821 Fairlynn Blvd. (just off Esperanza Road), Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Open weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 
779-0880. Anchored in a strip mall, this may well be the "last of the 
neighborhood saloons," as management claims. There's lots of wood, a jukebox 
heavy on classic rock, and help that knows the regulars -- from suits to 
shirt-sleeves types -- by name. RICK VANDERKNYFF

"Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An 
Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit, but gets 
one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
It's a comic tarantella with a soft-shoe style, and lots of little moments that 
make up for sentimental excesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among 
the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said 
to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's intentionally 
spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: the alien turns out to be a 
vegetable, of all things. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampire's Kiss" (1989), directed by Robert Bierman. 96 minutes. Rated R. A 
contemporary spin on the vampire fantasy, with Nicolas Cage as a neurotic New 
Yorker who thinks a one-night stand (Jennifer Beals) has turned him into 
Dracula. May be too offbeat for devoted horror fans, but this clever, 
cartoon-ish metaphor has bite. MARK CHALON SMITH

"The Pajama Game" (1957), directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott. 101 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
No rating. The plot is frivolous and obvious, the acting hammy, and much of the 
dialogue outright dumb, but who cares? This musical, starring Doris Day and 
John Raitt, is buoyed by Richard Adler/Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse 
choreography. And it's good clean American fun. DOUG LIST

"The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say "Arrrgh!" a lot 
and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the hatches. And this 
time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell. MIKE FLAGG

"The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time!" (1982), directed by Jim Brown. 78 minutes. 
No rating. A moving, foot-stomping, hand-clapping chronicle of the final 
appearance of the Weavers -- Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred 
Hellerman -- probably America's most memorable folk-singing group. MIKE SPENCER

This diner/drugstore in the heart of Old Towne Orange is a real throwback. 
True, the bobby-soxers are gone and the drugstore no longer fills prescriptions

meals are the kind Mom might've made. MARY HELEN BERG

THE NOT-SO-GOODFELLAS WANDER SCORCESE'S 'MEAN STREETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the meaner streets of "GoodFellas," there was just "Mean Streets," 
Martin Scorcese's look at a couple of wiseguys trying to push their way through 
New York's urban sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
The guys in "GoodFellas" are small-timers, but with a vision. Maybe they'll get 
made (invited into the Mafia's inner circle) or maybe they'll whack somebody 
for a really big payoff. The guys in "Mean Streets" (screening at UC Irvine on 
Friday) are small-timers too, but without ambition. They're not only small 
change, they're loose change rolling aimlessly through the alleyways. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Boy (a charged-up Robert DeNiro) owes minor-league money to loan sharks 
all over town and blows up mailboxes for kicks. His pals run embarrassingly 
petty scams on kids wanting to buy sparklers and cherry bombs for the Fourth of 
July. Hey, what's a guy to do when he doesn't have the right connections? The 
mobsters in "GoodFellas" would just laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Mean Streets," made in 1973, first showed Scorcese's beautiful obsession with 
the low-lifes he saw crime-scavenging through New York's tougher boroughs. The 
story of loser Johnny Boy and his protector Charlie (Harvey Keitel at his 
anxious best) is alive with affection: Scorcese lets his emotions, both 
friendly and not so friendly, instill the film with a juicy, comic realism. 
</P>
<P>
"Mean Streets" also got Scorcese thinking about the next level up, where 
Mafiosi pulled the strings. After 17 years, the result is "GoodFellas," not the 
operatic, majestically decadent world drawn in Coppola's "The Godfather" 
series, but a de-mythologized vision where violence is as natural as giving the 
doorman a nice tip. 
</P>
<P>
When you're not turning away from the amorality, the gangsters in "GoodFellas" 
are hilarious and talk in that dirty city-jive Scorcese is known for, and the 
guys in "Mean Streets" are hilarious in the same ways. But their hearts are 
different; Johnny Boy, Charlie and the little hoods that hang around them don't 
seem like they could pull off a hit -- it's a shock when one finally does at 
the film's end. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie, the only one with any hopes (he runs numbers but wants to own a 
restaurant), tries to remove himself from the bad influences choking in all 
around. He's got a nice girlfriend (Amy Robinson), likes taking care of Johnny 
Boy, and he knows what guilt is. In a mood-setting scene just before the 
opening credits, Charlie lies in bed, thinking to himself: "You don't make up 
for your sins in church, you do it at home, in the streets. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Too bad Johnny Boy is such a handful. DeNiro plays him like a street sprite who 
can't control his dangerous side. He keeps inviting trouble wherever he goes; 
it's like a curse. Keitel makes it clear that Charlie doesn't know quite what 
to do, but he keeps on trying. 
</P>
<P>
There's a dignity (and a sad-funny hopelessness) in Charlie's devotion, and it 
gives "Mean Streets" a kind of gutter nobility. 
</P>
<P>

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: AN ADMIRABLE RETURN TO THE BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Every so often, Broadway revives one of the great 1950s musicals and swaths the 
Great White Way with a warm, all-American glow quite unmatched by the icy 
spectaculars of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The new Nancaro's Restaurant &amp; Elephant Bar in Rancho Bernardo rather 
nicely revives the family restaurant of the '50s and '60s. The homey, 
old-fashioned plates contrast refreshingly with the chic but austere offerings 
of contemporary eateries. We're not talking gourmet here, but simple, carefully 
prepared fare that can seem just the ticket on a casual evening out. 
</P>
<P>
Nancaro's occupies renovated premises that formerly housed Jeremiah's, a 
steak-and-seafood place that had a long run on West Bernardo Drive. The new 
decor takes a sort of Stanley and Livingstone theme that reaches its apogee in 
the bar -- obviously intended as a watering hole for the mid-20s set -- but 
calms down in the dining room, a reasonably comfortable space outfitted with 
dark woods, a good deal of decorative brass, and occasional prints of hunters 
on safari. Overall, the style is rather that of an upscale coffee shop, a 
comment that quite neatly describes the tone of the menu as well. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the sort of place at which one thinks of dining in courses, 
although there are such starters as fried zucchini coins, an artichoke-zucchini 
dip served with tortilla chips, the inevitable stuffed potato skins, and a 
couple of soups. The menu announces that everything is freshly prepared, a 
claim repeated by the servers and witnessed by the soups, which do seem 
simmered from fresh, quality ingredients. An old-fashioned chicken noodle was 
fragrant with bay leaves and crowded with celery, carrots, onions, noodles and 
chunks of chicken. 
</P>
<P>
To a degree, the menu takes a something-for-everyone approach by offering Cobb, 
shrimp and chicken salads; assorted "gourmet" burgers; a list of sandwiches 
that, besides the usual club and french dip offerings, includes oak-broiled 
mahi-mahi on a buttered, toasted bun; a stir-fry of chicken with sesame seeds 
that seems to be stretching things a bit, and fettuccine with and without 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Just as fried chicken is virtually impossible to find outside chain-operated 
fried chicken coops, such simple pleasures as deep-fried shrimp have vanished 
from all but the humblest menus. Nancaro's serves them freshly breaded and 
crisply finished, on a platter heaped with french fries, good cole slaw and 
toasted "cheese" bread; these garnishes repeat on most plates. This is 
obviously simple, straightforward cooking, but it can be very satisfying and 
this restaurant does it well. 
</P>
<P>
There are such things as prime rib, Cajun blackened chicken (one of Nancaro's 
few, misguided bows to trendiness) and teriyaki sirloin, but the specialty 
platters hold much more interest. One that sounds particularly hearty takes its 
name from Kansas City and consists of a ground beef steak, broiled over oak and 
topped with grilled onions, mushrooms, cheese and tomato. The St. Louis platter 
offers a full rack of barbecued pork spareribs, and the smokehouse platter a 
rather tasty barbecued chicken breast topped with smoked ham, bacon and cheese; 
the garnish includes stewed, cinnamon-scented apples. All plates include more 
than enough food, and overall the restaurant seems to offer its customers good 
value for their money. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts take the theme of generosity to an almost absurd extreme and will 
generally feed two or three with ease. The list follows Nancaro's general mood 
and includes a massive mud pie, an apple-walnut cobbler served hot under a 
crunchy topping and a melting scoop of vanilla ice cream, and thick malts 
backed by a metal container that holds a second malt -- the serving amounts to 
at least a quart, not including the four or five inches of whipped cream that 
crown the glass.

KINGS TRY FOR MORE FROM LESS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: IN GRETZKY'S THIRD SEASON, THEY COULD GAIN VICTORIES BY CONCENTRATING 
ON DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, this entertainment capital had the premiere of "Gretzky," the 
story of a small-town hockey player who comes to the big city, hoping to bring 
it the elusive Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like a typical Hollywood format when the kid led his new team past 
his old. But when the Cup seemed within reach, the script took a twist. The kid 
and his new team got bumped off by the bad guys from Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Last year came "Gretzky II," but it turned out to be more of a remake than a 
sequel. Same story, same sad ending. Again a first-round upset in the playoffs. 
Again, second-round elimination. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight begins "Gretzky III: The Quest Continues," as the Kings open their 
1990-91 season at the Forum against the New York Islanders. And this time, vows 
Wayne Gretzky, the ending will be different. 
</P>
<P>
It's still the same old story for the Kings. The question is not how much they 
will score, but how much the others guys will score. The three most important 
keys to this team's chances are: defense, defense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to play a two-way game," said King defenseman Larry Robinson, who 
was one of the best for 17 seasons with the Montreal Canadiens. "We didn't 
adjust to that kind of game last year until crunch time in the playoffs. It 
takes a lot of extra effort to play good defense rather than the gun-them-up, 
shoot-them-down, you-score, I-score type of game we've been playing." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Kings scored 338 goals, second-highest total in the NHL. But 
they gave up 337, second-highest total in the Campbell Conference. Coach Tom 
Webster says his team can cut that goals-against figure by 50. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get back to playing defensive hockey," Webster said. "As long as we 
win, I don't care if it's boring. To win boring means not to make the high-risk 
play. Don't force plays if they are not there. Take the faceoff. Turn the other 
cheek." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 Kings figure to line up as follows: 
</P>
<P>
THE FRONT LINE -- About to turn 30, Gretzky, the Great One, is openly, 
unabashedly predicting great things for himself this season. 
</P>
<P>
The critics of last season's Bernie Nicholls trade to the New York Rangers have 
headed for cover, driven there by the offensive onslaught of those who took his 
place. 
</P>
<P>
In those brief moments when Gretzky, Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom were able 
to play on the same line, they were formidable. In one playoff game last 
season, the Gretzky-Granato-Sandstrom line accounted for 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Should all three stay injury-free this season, Gretzky wouldn't rule out a 
200-point season for himself. 
</P>
<P>
And right behind that line, is another formidable group, centered by Todd Elik, 
with Luc Robitaille on one side and Dave Taylor on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille scored 52 goals last season, his second 50-plus season in his past 
three, and totaled 101 points, trailing only Gretzky's 142 on the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Taylor, beginning his 14th season with the Kings, lends 
stability on the other wing. 
</P>
<P>
But the pivotal point is in the middle, where Elik will get a chance to 
establish himself. With all the talk about Granato and Sandstrom last season, 
an overlooked aspect of the Nicholls trade was the opportunity presented for 
Elik, to add speed to the offense. 
</P>
<P>
At least at the outset, the four lines will be: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sandstrom, Gretzky and Granato. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robitaille, Elik and Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Tonelli, Mike Krushelnyski and Francois Breault. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Kudelski, Steve Kasper and Scott Bjugstad. 
</P>
<P>
THE BACK LINE -- Things looked pretty bleak there for a while. Tom Laidlaw, 
troubled by back problems, hasn't skated since March. Bob Halkidis is still 
recovering from off-season shoulder surgery. And Robinson, who struggled much 
of last season at 38, will try to come back at 39. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings have come back from an exhibition swing raving about defenseman 
Rob Blake. A 20-year who was playing college hockey at Bowling Green a year 
ago, Blake turned pro at the end of last season and turned a lot of heads in 
the playoffs. The Kings say he is a rookie of the year candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Blake, the hot kid, will be teamed with Robinson, the cool veteran. If nothing 
else, they should lead the league in wing span, what with Blake standing 
6-feet-3 and Robinson 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The defensive pairs, at least at the outset: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robinson and Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Duchesne and Rod Buskas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tim Watters and Marty McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
GOALIE -- Kelly Hrudey will suit up. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, it was a nightly question whether he would be there or not. And 
for how long. A tough, dependable veteran of seven NHL seasons, Hrudey, who had 
always prided himself on his dependability, suffered through a nightmarish 
season. It began with mononucleosis and ended with cracked ribs. And it was 
made all the worse by the Kings' inability to find a suitable backup. 
</P>
<P>
They feel they have one now with the acquisition of Daniel Berthiaume from the 
Minnesota North Stars in a trade before training camp. Ron Scott and Mario 
Gosselin were sent to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
"We made no drastic changes. They decided to go for stability rather than the 
revolving door they've had here," Gretzky said. "This is our team and we'll win 
or die with it."

DUPREE'S DREAM A REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: RUNNING BACK SIGNS TWO-YEAR DEAL AFTER BEING OUT FOR FIVE YEARS WITH 
SEVERE KNEE INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was a lost cause a few months ago, remembered only for what he might have 
been and pitied for what he was. He was 50 pounds overweight, depressed and 
playing semipro baseball, the end result of a dream gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
Only his dream hasn't ended. Five years after he last played football, five 
years after suffering what was declared a career-ending knee injury, Marcus 
Dupree is a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
Dupree was signed Wednesday to a two-year deal by a team operating under the 
theory that you can never have enough 6-foot-3, 220-pound running backs who 
look like the reincarnation of Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, who put on pads Wednesday but did not work out with the team, wasn't 
even consigned to the Rams' practice squad, and instead was placed immediately 
on the Rams' 47-man active roster. He said it was a fulfillment of about 
everything he has hoped for since April, when he resumed training. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dreaming and hoping and praying," Dupree said of the days when he was 
fighting to get his then-270-pound body into NFL shape. "I did a lot of 
praying. And God gave me the will to keep going all summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest hurdle was this summer, working out, getting back into it, doing 
it every day. From July on, I went through two-a-days with Coach (Bob) Hill, 
who coached Walter (Payton) in college, two-a-days all the way until now. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, I just went out there and sweated and threw up and I just said, 
'It's going to be worth it one day.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, 26, said it will take at least "three or four weeks" to get his left 
knee ready for action, and he wouldn't be upset at all if the Rams decide to 
put him on the injured reserve list to make sure he is completely sound before 
letting him play. 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, who gained 905 yards as a freshman at Oklahoma in 1983 before jumping 
to the United States Football League the next year, tore up his knee in the 
first game of his second USFL season. At the time, the doctors, the team, its 
insurance company and Dupree agreed that he would never play again. 
</P>
<P>
But after receiving encouragement from Payton, the league's all-time leading 
rusher, and others this spring, Dupree decided to make his bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I just decided I need to play ball," Dupree said. "That's what God put me on 
this earthfor." 
</P>
<P>
Dupree turned immediately to the Rams because of quarterback coach Dick Coury, 
who was Dupree's USFL coach and counselor in the years after the injury. The 
Rams, who drafted him in the 12th round in 1986, worked him out Monday, gave 
his knee a battery of tests and told him they wanted him. And that was it, 
since Dupree was dedicated to playing for the Rams if they wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are being cautious about Dupree, indicating that he probably will be 
put on injured reserve soon. Ram Coach John Robinson said Dupree definitely 
will not suit up this Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals at Anaheim Stadium, 
and possibly not at all this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is long range," Robinson said. "This is one of those things where you 
say, you know, what if? You look at the man and say, ooooh, what if? 
</P>
<P>
"We've decided on a course of action to take a closer look at this man. There's 
no question that before his injury he was a great player." 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson also said Dupree's knee has passed every test they have given it, 
and the Rams think he can make it all the way back. When, they do not know. 
</P>
<P>
"This is new ground for us," Robinson said. "And we're going to treat it as new 
ground and take it step by step. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like he needs to be scrutinized under some pounding or some stress. I 
don't mean scrimmage, I just mean running every day to see if it swells. 
</P>
<P>
"Our early indications are, at some point in the near future he will be well. 
Obviously, there will be a period of adjustment. We hope that won't be too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Dupree's signing, on the heels of the Rams' relative 
ineffectiveness running the ball lately, was not a sign that he is unhappy with 
his tailback position, shared by Cleveland Gary, Gaston Green and Curt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did not put Dupree on the practice squad, he said, because 
practice-squad players are virtual free agents, and the Rams did not want to 
lose him so easily. 
</P>
<P>
Dupree signed for one year plus an option year at a salary believed to be 
slightly over the minimum base of $70,000, but stocked with incentive clauses 
and guarantees even if he never plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't asking them to do anything, but the club was very, very generous," 
Dupree's agent, Bud Holmes, said. "For a club to pay a kid who's been out five 
years and ruled to have a career-ending injury, I think it's just unheard of. 
It's beyond his wildest dreams."

SHELL WANTS NO BOUQUETS; 
</P>
<P>
HE HAS TURNED RAIDERS AROUND, BUT SAYS JOB ISN'T FINISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
No one dropped a floral bouquet on Art Shell's desk. Champagne corks did not 
pop, toasts were not raised. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he didn't even remember the anniversary until someone quietly 
congratulated him when he arrived at the Raiders' headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What are you talking about?' " Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
Then it registered. A year ago Wednesday, Shell made national headlines when he 
was named the first black head coach in modern National Football League 
history, replacing Mike Shanahan. The significance of the hiring was raised by 
sociologists and sportswriters alike. It isn't anymore. 
</P>
<P>
For Shell, Wednesday was just another day in the life of a good football coach. 
He couldn't have planned it better. No "Nightline" panel discussions on TV, no 
subplots. Just a good coach and his undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about it," Shell said of the social significance of his 
first year. "Now that you bring it up, I hope it does help other minority 
coaches. But it will only be (helpful) if I'm successful." 
</P>
<P>
Shell does not consider what he has done so far a success, despite numbers that 
say otherwise. In the 16 games before Shell took over, the Raiders were 6-10. 
In the 16 games since, they are 11-5, 9-0 at home, and one of four undefeated 
teams in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not success to me," Shell said. "Success only means winning the Super 
Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Shell, it cannot be ignored, has transformed basically the same body of talent 
from losers into winners almost overnight, in a football sense. Players speak 
of him with reverence. To them, Shell is a walking sandwich board for NFL 
Films. His presence is imposing, they say, his credentials unquestionble. When 
Shell tells of football wars, he knows whereof he speaks. He is, after all, a 
Hall of Fame offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"Good coaches who have tremendous coaching ability can also be successful," 
nose tackle Bob Golic said. "But there's a definite benefit when you've been a 
player before. . . . In training camp, he called practice off a half-hour early 
because it seemed like the guys were a little beat up and tired. He said, 'Go 
back to your room, and put your feet up and relax.' How often do you hear 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Shell, who shed more than 40 pounds in an off-season weight-loss program, also 
commands the physical respect of his players. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had all our offensive linemen go down and he had to get in uniform, you 
could never tell that this man has been out of football for a long time," 
defensive end Greg Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
When two Raiders got in a training camp scuffle, Shell, 43, explained that if 
they didn't break it up, they'd soon be squaring off against him. End of fight. 
</P>
<P>
Shell's approach to football is blunt. "Direct, to the point," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to X's and O's, Shell may not be confused with the Bill Walshes 
of the world, but that's not "Raider football" anyway. The problem with 
Shanahan, most have concluded, was that he wasn't a Raider. His offense, based 
on finesse, was complicated, something Al Davis' teams have never been. 
</P>
<P>
Shell has described Raider football as power, explosion and simplicity. Unlike 
Shanahan, Shell has only two rules: Be on time and concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
"(Shanahan had) unnecessary rules," Townsend said. "Ones that don't have 
anything to do with football, like the coaches telling you you can't sit on 
your helmets, or they give you water breaks and you can't get water on your own 
time. Do you want discipline or do you want football players? You want football 
players, no matter how rowdy or radical they are. You want football players 
that are willing to win for you." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are willing under Shell. He gives his players plenty of rope, so 
long as they don't cross him. Make no mistake: There is power and passion in 
his presence . 
</P>
<P>
"We make sure he's happy because he's a big guy," wide receiver Willie Gault 
said. "He's an intense person when he has to be. He lets us know when we're 
wrong and he lets us know when we're right. He doesn't shoot you curveballs. 
When he says something, he means it. He can back up whatever he says. If he 
said he could run faster than me, I'd say, 'OK, fine. I believe you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Having spent five years in Chicago with Bear Coach Mike Ditka, Gault knows what 
it's like to take orders from a former NFL star. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, Gault said, is different. He's not a screamer. He doesn't break 
clipboards or tear up locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"They're different styles," he said. "They're both winners, but I think Art 
attacks it much differently. It's not so much a verbal attack as it is his 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said Shell doesn't need to open his mouth to get his point across. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a look he gives you," Townsend said. "That's all he does. You really 
don't want him to say anything to you. . . . It's a look like, 'Hey, one more 
time and . . . ' "' 
</P>
<P>
And maybe Shell puts on a helmet and lines up across from you. 
</P>
<P>
How much of a difference has Shell made? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's 100%," Townsend said. "Everyone's loose around here, no one's 
up-tight about anything. It just makes the atmosphere much different." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, it can be said, had talent before Shell arrived, and didn't win. 
They had Gault, Townsend, Howie Long, Marcus Allen, Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't they play hard for Shanahan? 
</P>
<P>
Townsend: "The only thing I can say is when you get a person like Art Shell, 
who played 15 years, was an assistant for 7 1/2, who comes from a winning 
background, you just feel, well, you know, what this guy is talking about. You 
believe what he's saying because he's done it. You don't do 15 years in the NFL 
and coach afterward and not know what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Golic said it takes more than talent to win. "It's how the talent is utilized," 
he said, "How the team feels about itself is probably the most important thing. 
If you don't feel good about yourself or aren't using the talent well, then it 
doesn't matter. I played on a team with the Patriots at the beginning of my 
career, with four first-round draft choices in the defensive secondary. And we 
couldn't stop anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Golic said he has only seen one major change in Shell: "Now that he's lost that 
weight, he's not as imposing. I'm not as intimidated. If he keeps going with 
this weight thing, we'll even carry him off the field on our shoulders after 
one of these games."

DAVE DISTEL: JOE SHOULD ADVISE HIM TO HIT THE ROAD, JACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Joe McIlvaine journeyed to Los Angeles Wednesday night to meet with his 
Padres for the first time, he could have dispensed with one of 1990's biggest 
problems with fewer than a few words. 
</P>
<P>
One word would suffice, to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby. 
</P>
<P>
OK, two more. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
The man has spent so much of the season with his foot in his mouth, he should 
go to a cobbler rather than a dentist. Yo, Jack, is that your mouth or a shoe 
store? 
</P>
<P>
Neither wit nor wisdom have spewed forth, but Clark has not been at a loss for 
words. 
</P>
<P>
His specialty has been vitriol, and much of that has been directed at Mr. Tony 
Gwynn. When Gwynn, in the aftermath of a season-ending injury, abandons the 
team without a farewell, something is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
He and Tony Gwynn get along about as well as Jerry Glanville and Sam Wyche. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows when this started? Undoubtedly, it was long before the celebrated 
clubhouse blowup in New York last May. That was merely when it hit the surface. 
And it has festered since, exploding again last week when Clark took a few more 
shots at his injured teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all this talk about Mr. Padre, Mr. San Diego, and all that crap. I 
just want to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
And . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be, 'Poor little Tony, making $1 million and batting .300.' 
That's not something you should be pouting about. How about the kids in 
wheelchairs and those people?" 
</P>
<P>
And . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He let his wife do a lot of talking for him. It's like, 'Tony, do you put your 
foot down, or do you let your wife talk for you?' Hey, maybe we should all get 
our wives involved in the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute, aren't both spouses normally involved in the decision-making 
process? 
</P>
<P>
Who is this guy? Victor Kiam? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Clark's wife should be doing the talking in the family. Clark isn't doing 
too well on his own. The guy who ripped Gwynn's concern for making a relatively 
modest, by today's standards, $1 million a year was the same guy who said a 
$2.5 million offer to him was an insult. 
</P>
<P>
Figure it out, Jack. It can't be both ways. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about this guy that he cannot get along with Tony Gwynn? Gwynn is 
the kind of person you hope your daughter brings home. When the house next door 
goes up for sale, you hope a guy like Gwynn buys it. Ripping Tony Gwynn is like 
ripping a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
And yet Jack Clark does it, at first quietly, then loudly and finally publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Even curmudgeonly Dick Williams, who has little praise for anyone in his book 
No More Mr. Nice Guy, had nothing but nice things to say about Gwynn both 
professionally and personally. 
</P>
<P>
If it's any consolation to Gwynn, he's not the only superstar to incur Clark's 
wrath. 
</P>
<P>
Look at what he had to say about former St. Louis teammate Ozzie Smith last 
year: "Ozzie Smith is in this only to make himself look better. That's all he 
cares about. He butters up the Cardinal organization so, when things go wrong, 
somebody else can take the fall. Guys like Ozzie Smith are a speck, just a 
speck. You just dust him away." 
</P>
<P>
At about this point, it should be obvious who should be dusted away . . . 
though it cannot be said Jack Clark is just a speck. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Clark is a specter of what is wrong with the Padres. In this most 
disruptive of seasons, he has stirred the most haunting memories. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark is the first problem Joe McIlvaine must confront and solve. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Gwynn cannot both be part of the 1991 Padres. One of them has to go. 
That decision is the easy one. 
</P>
<P>
Given no choice but to dispose of Clark, McIlvaine's chore becomes a bit 
tougher. How he goes about it and what he gets in return will set the initial 
course for his administration as the Padres' vice-president in charge of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
This was the unresolved problem that cost Jack McKeon both of his jobs. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine must address it and address it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, an American League team can use a designated hitter or a National 
League team can use a designated tongue. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Jack Clark should shut his mouth and try doing something he 
does not seem to be very good at. 
</P>
<P>
Listening. 
</P>
<P>
Or just read my lips. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby.

UNIFICATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT GERMAN TEAMS TO MELD EASILY; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS PROGRAM: THE BUDGET FOR COMBINED GROUP IS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN HALF 
WHAT DISMANTLED EAST GERMAN MACHINE SPENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's athletic Miracle Machine was removed from its life-support 
system Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Without a home and virtually penniless, it passed into posterity with the 
satisfaction that it achieved more with less than any other system for 
developing high-performance athletes in the history of international sports. 
</P>
<P>
Although East Germany competed in the Olympic Games as a separate country for 
only 20 years, 1968-1988, it won more medals than all but three countries -- 
the United States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 16.7 million, it finished behind only the Soviet Union 
(population, 280 million) and ahead of the United States (population, 226.5 
million) in the 1988 medal standings at the Winter and Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But after Wednesday's reunification, athletes from East and West Germany are 
merging. They will compete separately for the last time later this month at the 
World Rowing Championships in Australia. The first time they will compete as 
one team will be at January's World Swimming Championships in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of eulogies for the recently departed, members and observers of the 
international sports community were reluctant to judge East Germany's sports 
system harshly. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a piece of exotica," said John Hoberman, a Germanic languages 
professor at the University of Texas in Austin and an author of syndicated 
columns and a book about international sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The world has never seen a sports system like it and is not likely to again 
for some time. Like a rare, strange flower that bloomed and is now gone, it 
will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
Critics contended through the years that it was a little shop of horrors, 
alleging that the East Germans manipulated children into choosing sports 
careers and then used them in scientific experiments designed to enhance 
performances. For example, recent reports from a West German magazine, Der 
Spiegel, supply further evidence that the doping of East German athletes was 
systematic. 
</P>
<P>
"East Germany developed the science of sports to the highest degree," said 
Anita DeFrantz, an International Olympic Committee member from Los Angeles who 
competed as a rower against the East Germans. "But the athletes will have to 
tell the story about what really went on. Some of the stories might be rather 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, I think we created more of a mystique than there was. People 
wanted to believe there was something East Germany had that no one else did to 
explain why they were being dusted." 
</P>
<P>
After competing as part of a single German team until 1968, the East Germans 
emphatically arrived as a sports superpower at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, 
where they won six more gold medals than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, U.S. journalist Doug Gilbert, in his book, "The Miracle 
Machine," wrote that East Germany succeeded because it "gives sports a higher 
priority than it is given anywhere else . . . " 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's elite sports budget for the four years before 1988 has been 
estimated at $600 million, six times higher than the U.S. Olympic Committee's 
budget for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
But now there are new priorities. Faced with more pressing economic concerns, 
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently agreed to contribute federal money 
toward the maintenance of the sports system established in East Germany. 
Government officials estimate that the budget for elite sports in unified 
Germany will be about $70 million a year, less than half the amount spent by 
East Germany alone in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, as many as 20 of the 25 East German sports schools used to train 
and educate athletes from ages 8 to 18 might have to close. Some have been 
spared by opening their doors to non-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Sports College in Leipzig has become a general curriculum 
university. About 75% of the graduates devoted their careers to sports, many of 
them as coaches, but the number in the future is expected to be 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The primary scientific centers, such as the drug laboratory in Kreischa and the 
sports science research facility in Leipzig, will remain open, leading to 
speculation that some of the abuses that allegedly occurred in East Germany 
might continue. 
</P>
<P>
"They are doing with East German sports scientists what the United States did 
with Nazi rocket scientists after World War II," Hoberman said. "The new German 
system also will be rigged in favor of performance." 
</P>
<P>
But will that performance produce a sum that is equal to its parts? If East and 
West German medals from the 1988 Summer Olympics were combined, the total of 
142 would beat the Soviet Union by 10. But because the two countries were 
strong in several of the same sports, some medalists would not have been in 
Seoul if Germany had sent only one team. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the unification is expected to be as difficult in sports as it is in 
other areas of society. Some athletes from both sides already are complaining 
about having to compete next to their former rivals. 
</P>
<P>
When the East German women won the 400-meter relay at the European Track and 
Field Championships last month in Yugoslavia, one team member, Kerstin 
Behrendt, said: "The goal of our relay team is to continue running without any 
West German sprinters." 
</P>
<P>
There also is a question about the response of East German athletes when they 
discover that most of the coaches and administrators are West German, although 
the East German system was more successful. Many East German coaches already 
have accepted positions in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're going to see is a hybrid kind of system," Hoberman said. 
"It will be relatively stronger than the old West German system but not as 
efficient as the East German system."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
The surest way for the Kings to contend for the Stanley Cup championship would 
be to change divisions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pity the Smythies. You beat Calgary in the playoffs and then you've got to beat 
Edmonton. Or the other way around. But not even Bruce McNall has been able to 
buy his way into the Norris Division, so the Kings must open another season 
tonight as a member of the mighty Smythe. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Next best thing McNall could do would be to tighten what has been a sieve of a 
defense. He and General Manager Rogie Vachon took an unusual tack in the 
off-season. They didn't make a single major transaction. But maybe it wasn't 
such a terrible idea. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Some reasons why the goals-against average should be reduced from 4.17: 
Goaltender Kelly Hrudey is physically sound; defenseman Rob Blake will play his 
first complete season; speedy forwards Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato also 
will be here full time, and Coach Tom Webster is preaching two-way hockey. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
I was rooting for George Brett to win the American League batting title until 
he chickened out and chose not to play Tuesday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ted Williams could have sat out the last day of the 1941 season and hit .400. 
Instead, he played both games of a doubleheader, went six for eight and wound 
up hitting .406. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among those picking the underdog in the National League championship series is 
Tom Lasorda. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've gotta go with the team from our division," the Dodger manager 
said. "But I've got a good reason. Pennants are won and lost by the bullpen. 
Cincinnati has as good a bullpen as I've seen in a long while.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda believes the Dodgers' most damaging loss this season was Sept. 16 at 
Riverfront Stadium, when they loaded the bases three times and couldn't score. 
"That meant a difference of two games because we were playing the Reds," he 
said. "Those games when we blew the big leads -- 10 and seven runs -- meant 
only one game in the standings.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda on 1990: "It was a great year in the respect of where we came from, but 
to get so close and never catch the Reds was disappointing. I'm proud of these 
guys. It wasn't for lack of effort that we didn't win. And I congratulate the 
Reds for the job they did.". . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's next trip will be to New York, where he will ride down Fifth Avenue 
as grand marshal of the Columbus Day parade. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Padres, who are accustomed to lesser renditions, heard the 
national anthem sung the way it should be by Katey Sagal before Tuesday night's 
game at Dodger Stadium. . . . Bob Welch's 27 wins for the Oakland Athletics is 
an outstanding achievement, but Steve Carlton was out of sight when he went 
27-10 in 1972 for a Philadelphia Phillies team that was 59-97. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger general manager Al Campanis says the split-finger pitch has made 
scouting a lot more difficult. "It used to be that you could look at a pitcher 
and say he's too short to make it," Campanis said. "Now, he may not be too 
short if he's got that split-finger.". . . The Padres have made a step in the 
right direction by hiring Joe McIlvaine, who developed the New York Mets' farm 
system. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Wayne Gretzky and Sean Penn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, the top-ranked college football team in the nation, isn't in the 
top 10 of any NCAA team or individual statistical department. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lightning and thunder: USC fullback Scott Lockwood blocked as well as he ran 
Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't fret if you can't pick up the TNT cable network on your television set. 
Channel 9 also will show the Raiders-Buffalo Bills game Sunday at 4:30 p.m. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
It'll be interesting to see if Mike Fratello, the other finalist for the 
Clipper coaching job, dares to second-guess Mike Schuler when Fratello does the 
color commentary on the team's telecasts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Comeback of the year award goes to Jaime Jarrin, the Dodger broadcaster who 
finished the season strongly after suffering serious injuries in an automobile 
crash at Vero Beach, Fla. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most NBA observers think that Jerry West stole Terry Teagle from the Golden 
State Warriors, conceding that the draft choice the Lakers gave up will be very 
low in the first round. . . . This is the one time of the year when all four 
major pro sports are going -- hockey begins tonight, basketball training camps 
are under way, and you know about baseball and football. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the best players on the USC women's golf team is Kalaya Bhaedhayajibh. 
It's pronounced just the way it looks.

<P>
It hangs on a wall in the manager's office, its bright colors shining through 
the cigarette smoke, high above the lineup cards and souvenir baseballs and 
everything else associated with the team inhabiting the adjoining clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
It is a painting of a postgame celebration by the 1975 World Series champion 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
As if Lou Piniella needed to be reminded. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been hearing about the Big Red Machine all year, and it's unfair," said 
Piniella, manager of the 1990 Reds. "The fans never forget about that team . . 
. but it's time. It's time to take a good look at what is going on now." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of hundred miles away, high on a wall in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
clubhouse, the television set is tuned to a baseball game that has seemed to 
last all summer. This is because every time the players look, the same team is 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
That team is the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
As if the Pirates needed to be reminded. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, all we heard about all year was the New York Mets," R.J. Reynolds 
said. "Every time you watch ESPN, they had the Mets. All we heard was how the 
Pirates were going to fall apart. Everyone jumped on the Mets' bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, adding: "I guess we showed everybody what we are made of." 
</P>
<P>
The opponents in the 1990 National League championship series, in winning 
pressure games and disproving countless critics, have done nearly everything 
this season except remove the chips from their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
For one team, that process will begin at 5 PDT tonight in the opener at 
Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, champions of the West, were the first NL team since the 
implementation of the 162-game schedule to be in first place from start to 
finish. They have the league's most explosive offense and an intimidating 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, all they keep hearing is how their emotional manager throws tantrums -- 
and bases. 
</P>
<P>
And how their owner, Marge Schott, is the type to take a playoff T-shirt from 
shortstop Barry Larkin and fit it on her St. Bernard. Last weekend, 
incidentally, the dog relieved himself near the visiting dugout in the middle 
of the Reds' division-clinching celebration. 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything, they keep hearing about the last Cincinnati team to 
play in a World Series, the one that won consecutive World Series in 1975 and 
'76. 
</P>
<P>
To these Reds, those Reds have become the Big Headache Machine. 
</P>
<P>
"If you aren't careful, you can let those comparisons get to you," said Larkin, 
a Cincinnati native who has spent his life hearing about those glory years. 
"You can't go out there and say, 'Hey, I've got to play like Dave Concepcion.' 
You just can't do it. You've got to be yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Said Piniella: "All summer, I heard how this was a team and a manager out of 
control, how this was a team that could not do it. It was almost like we 
weren't even in first place sometimes. Well, we've got that monkey off our 
backs a little bit. We have done it. And now we're ready to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Flying into town late Wednesday was a Pittsburgh team facing different sorts of 
biases. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, champions of the East, probably have the league's most valuable 
player in outfielder Barry Bonds. And probably the league's Cy Young Award 
winner in 22-game winner Doug Drabek. And definitely the league's best outfield 
in Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke. 
</P>
<P>
So why are they always scowling? 
</P>
<P>
Because few outsiders will let them forget how, with virtually the same team in 
1988, they choked down the stretch to the Mets. And how they blew a six-game 
lead this September and almost did it again. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the long shadow cast by the last Pirate team to win a World 
Series, in 1979, the one known by its theme song, "We Are Family." 
</P>
<P>
These Pirates have no such theme or likable leader such as Willie Stargell. 
</P>
<P>
They have, instead, a wiry, cigar-smoking manager who worked in the minor 
leagues for 11 years before finally receiving his first chance. And from Jim 
Leyland, they have picked up an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week in the Pirates' clubhouse, a newspaper clipping was lying on 
a trunk, ready for tape and posting. The clipping contained an underlined quote 
by Rob Dibble, who with Randy Myers and Norm Charlton form the core of the 
Reds' bullpen. Dibble had said: "We've got the best bullpen in either league, 
and we feel that will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Reds' bullpen, Van Slyke said: "Those three guys put on 
their jocks the same we we do, don't they? I think we have just as good a 
bullpen; it's just nobody hears about it." 
</P>
<P>
Leyland said: "Everybody is looking for a secret. Well, there's no secret here 
-- none of that clubhouse chemistry stuff. We just have a bunch of guys playing 
well." 
</P>
<P>
It is because of that strength throughout the lineup that the Pirates are 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' outfield of Eric Davis, Billy Hatcher or Herm Winningham, and Paul 
O'Neill can't compare to the Pirates' outfield, led by Bonds, who finished with 
33 home runs and 114 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Larkin, who hit .300, is more impressive than inconsistent Pirate shortstop Jay 
Bell. But Pirate second baseman Jose Lind may be the most important player on 
the team. "He has made at least five plays that have saved us games," Leyland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lind's counterpart, former Dodger Mariano Duncan, could have trouble with 
Pirate pitching, as two of Pittsburgh's three scheduled starters are 
right-handed and he is batting .229 against right-handers. He will play every 
game only because Bill Doran is sidelined with back problems. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Duncan will finally have a national forum to continue his 
season-long bashing of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what I like about this team?" Duncan said Wednesday. "When we 
celebrated winning the division, we could put champagne on everyone. With the 
Dodgers, if you get champagne on Mike Marshall, something bad (is) going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds might hold the edge at third base, where Chris Sabo has quietly hit 25 
homers while the Pirates' Jeff King still can look as if he's in his first full 
season. But there are doubts about rookie first baseman Hal Morris, who has 
looked so bad at the plate lately that Piniella has considered benching him. 
The Pirates' Sid Bream has been consistent most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The catching, matching Joe Oliver's great arm for the Reds against the 
leadership and clutch hitting of Pittsburgh's Mike LaValliere and Don Slaught, 
is probably a push. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' biggest advantage, and their biggest hope, lies in the bullpen. The 
Reds have lost only five times when leading after seven innings, and have lost 
only eight times when they scored four or more runs. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 games against the Pirates, the Reds won the six games when they scored 
four or more runs, and lost the six games when they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
While the Reds were being swept by the Pirates in four games at Riverfront 
Stadium Aug. 17-19, neither Dibble nor Myers made an appearance. Myers, who has 
31 saves, has not allowed the Pirates an earned run in 4 2/3 innings this 
season, while Dibble is 1-0 with one allowed run in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds is hitting .190 against the Reds this season, King .160. A big reason is 
the bullpen, which should be even better because of the two weekend days off 
ordered by CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the time off, but it allowed us to put Norm Charlton back in the 
pen, and that makes us that much better," Piniella said of the game's premier 
left-handed middle reliever, who made 16 starts late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret," Piniella added. "We'd like to score early and get the game to 
our bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
Helping the Reds reach the bullpen will be a three-man rotation that has 
pitched well lately but has been mediocre most of the season, especially 
against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rijo, tonight's starter and the Reds' hottest pitcher, is 0-1 with a 3.78 
ERA against the Pirates; Tom Browning, Friday's starter, is 0-0 with a 3.86 ERA 
against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
And don't think the Reds' starters aren't a bit intimidated by the Pirates: 
Their staff issued 59 walks to the Pirates this season, the most to any team. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates will counter with three starters -- Bob Walk, Drabek and Zane Smith 
-- who are a combined 3-2 with a 2.53 ERA against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the protests by Van Slyke, the Pirates' bullpen does not match up. 
Bill Landrum, a left-hander, leads with 13 saves, but his right-handed 
counterpart, Ted Power, has allowed the Reds six runs in four innings.

DODGERS: FIRST BASEMAN FINISHES WITH TWO HITS FOR .330 AVERAGE. L.A. GOES OVER 
3 MILLION IN ATTENDANCE. PADRES HIT FOUR HOME RUNS OFF COOK IN 7-3 VICTORY.

The Dodgers finished the season the way it began, against the San Diego Padres 
in Dodger Stadium. This time, though, there were several unfamiliar faces in 
the lineup for both sides, and instead of anticipating another season, they 
were shaking hands and saying their farewells. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers punched out for 1990 with a 7-3 loss in front of 29,930. That 
brought their season attendance total to 3,002,396 -- their highest since 1986 
and best in the National League this season. 
</P>
<P>
There were several memories on this final night: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eddie Murray said goodby with two hits in three at-bats, finishing the 
season second in the league to Willie McGee (.335) with a .3297 batting 
average. Entering the game, Murray was third in the NL at .327, but he 
surpassed New York's Dave Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
Murray left the game for a pinch-runner after his second hit, a looping, 
run-scoring single to left in the fifth. Murray jogged off the field, 
disappeared into the Dodger dugout to chants of "Ed-die!, Ed-die!" Alfredo 
Griffin and Mike Sharperson darted out to take Murray's curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great accomplishment for Eddie," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
"I'm really happy for him. He had a hell of a year for us. He's been a joy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eric Show (6-8) earned his 100th victory as a Padre, becoming the first 
pitcher in the organization to reach that level. Show pitched five innings and 
gave up three runs and seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Padres tied a franchise record with four home runs -- all against 
Dodger starter Dennis Cook (9-4). Darrin Jackson, Jerald Clark and Mike 
Pagliarulo each hit a homer in the third to give the Padres a 3-0 lead, and 
Mark Parent added another in the sixth. Cook was removed two batters into the 
sixth and was charged with five runs and 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dodger third baseman Dave Hansen got his first major league hit, a 
run-scoring single to center in a two-run fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jackson got a career-high four hits -- three singles and a homer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitcher Jay Howell will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee 
today. The surgery will be performed by Dr. Ralph Gambardella. . . . 
Broadcaster Vin Scully became a grandfather for the first time when Brittany 
Grace Schaefer was born early Tuesday morning at Cedar Sinai Hospital. . . . 
The Dodgers announced before the game that Barry Stockhamer has been named vice 
president of marketing, and Brent Shyer has been named director of broadcasting 
and publications.

Scott Miller, UCLA's senior flanker, missed the first three games of the season 
with a broken collarbone but was impressive in his season debut last Saturday 
night against Washington State. He returned a punt 47 yards and set up a 
touchdown the first time he touched the ball, had three punt returns for 62 
yards and caught three passes for 67 yards, one of those good for 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, UCLA's opponent Saturday at the Rose Bowl, has scored in 207 
consecutive games, the second-longest streak in NCAA history. UCLA is the 
record-holder, with a current scoring streak of 220 games. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State was the last team to shut out Arizona, 31-0, in the final game of 
the 1971 season. UCLA has not been shut out since losing to Michigan, 38-0, in 
the third game of 1971. MAL FLORENCE

SINGLETON TACKLED LEUKEMIA HEAD ON; 
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA: A YEAR AFTER BEING STRUCK BY THE DISEASE, HE'S BACK AT LINEBACKER FOR 
THE WILDCATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Kevin Singleton said it was in late June or early July of 1989 that he began to 
feel fatigued while working out. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought I was overworking, so I'd just take a week off," the Arizona 
linebacker said. "That week turned into a year." 
</P>
<P>
On July 13, 1989, it was determined that Singleton had acute leukemia. 
Chemotherapy and other treatments began, and they took their toll as his weight 
dropped from 235 to 200 pounds. It was the low point, physically and 
emotionally, for this strong young man from Parsippany, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole time, I was pretty much down," Singleton said from Tucson. "I had to 
have a lot of support from my family and people who cared about me. It was a 
down point the whole time. There is no up point about having leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
A medical dictionary defines leukemia as a disease of the blood-forming tissues 
wherein abnormal white blood cells are found in the bloodstream in unusual 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he knew about the disease at the time, Singleton said: "Nothing." 
And his reaction when told that he had what can be a fatal disease? "I thought 
they've got to be kidding. I didn't even know that it was related to cancer. 
That's how ignorant I was on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
Singleton said he began to study the disease and, as he did, his attitude 
improved as he learned "what was going on in my body." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Singleton has an identical twin, Chris, a former All-American linebacker 
at Arizona now playing for the New England Patriots. "Chris has been my 
life-support system," Kevin said, and he meant it literally. 
</P>
<P>
In late January, Singleton received a bone marrow transplant from his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't have an identical twin, I'd probably still be looking for a donor 
right now," Singleton said. "I hear it takes about a year to wait for a donor. 
There would have been complications because leukemia doesn't wait around for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"Chemotherapy will eventually break you down and kill you; I think because by 
using all those drugs you have kidney and liver failure and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Singleton said he had chemotherapy treatments for two weeks every month for six 
months before the bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
After the transplant, Singleton said he had six days of high-dose radiation 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I would lie in rice bags (for treatment) 20 minutes on each side of my body," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton began the slow road back to recovery. He said he never told anyone he 
wanted to play football again, but kept his motivation to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a fighter and competitor and I applied that desire into 
fighting the disease," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is apparently winning the fight, as he was on the field for Arizona's 
opening game against Illinois on Sept. 8 and will play against UCLA Saturday at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt when he got into the game against the Illini, Singleton said: 
"It was a definite step for me to see where I was. I played about 10 or 15 
plays to see what I needed to work on to be Kevin Singleton again, the football 
player." 
</P>
<P>
His comeback astonishes and inspires his friends, teammates and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an amazing thing for us to witness because he has been such a 
tremendous role model for everybody on how to handle extreme adversity," 
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. "He was devastated when (the disease) occurred, 
and then the character and fight within him took over and he fought leukemia 
just like he has fought everything else in his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a 3.0 grade-point average and battled back to be cleared to play 
medically -- way, way before anyone thought he could do that. He's a great 
example for all of us, and also made us realize how unimportant football really 
is at times." 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, a senior, was granted an additional year of eligibility by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing great right now," he said. "My strength is up and my endurance is 
doing well and I'm getting the feel of the game again. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking a year off from the game takes a lot out of you, especially what I've 
been through. I think I'm at a high point now and can't do anything but get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has been averaging about 20 plays a game and reasons that his 
playing time will increase as the season progresses. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, who weighs 220 pounds, said he can bench press 385 pounds, and his 
goal is to get to 400 pounds by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In March, only two months after the bone marrow transplant, he struggled to 
lift 135 pounds in the weight room. He was discouraged, but persevered. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Singleton, first-round draft choice of the Patriots, said his brother's 
attitude is a key element in the recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been upbeat and determined to get stronger," Chris said. "It's 
just another challenge for him. He didn't sit back and let this thing bring him 
down. He attacked it, and every time he was feeling good, he was in the weight 
room or running or doing something to keep in shape, and to keep his sanity, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
As for the bone marrow transplant, Chris said: "We're blessed in that way. I'm 
very thankful that I had an opportunity to help him." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Singleton said he's used to calling his brother every other day, but he 
wants to wean himself from the frequent telephone calls. "I need to start 
handling things on my own," he said. "It's time we went our different ways." 
</P>
<P>
Chris isn't so sure that will happen. "I don't think he can stop (calling), and 
I don't think I can either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Rifkin, the associate director of the bone marrow transplant program 
at the Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson, said there is a 45% to 60% chance that 
Kevin will not have a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface, those don't sound like good odds," Dr. Rifkin told the Mesa 
(Ariz.) Tribune. "But what must be kept in mind is that (this type of) acute 
leukemia is a disease that tends to relapse." 
</P>
<P>
Said Singleton: "I've been told that it takes about three years to say you're 
cured. I'm in total remission now. There are no signs of any kind. If there 
were, I'd be having problems now." 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, 23, doesn't plan to join his brother in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 1% (of the players) make the pros, and I have a slim chance of making 
it," he said. "I just want to get my degree, coach or do something and go on 
about my life. I'm just happy to be alive, to tell you the truth."

AUBURN COACH RETURNS TO PRACTICE

<TEXT>
<P>
Auburn Coach Pat Dye left the hospital and returned to football drills, 
promising to develop better eating habits and avoid the stomach distress that 
has hit him twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dye's condition was diagnosed as pre-uclerous, and he said tests are being 
conducted to determine which medication he should take. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the hospital Sunday night after his No. 5-ranked Tigers' 26-26 tie 
with No. 6 Tennessee but does not think the ailment is related to the pressures 
of his work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more diet-related than anything," he said. "I don't eat breakfast. I 
drink three or four cups of coffee and go eat lunch. . . . I don't think my 
diet habits are what they should be." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State's improvement has to be put in perspective, but the turnaround 
from a 1-10 record in 1989 to 3-1 this season has fans impressed at Manhattan, 
Kan. 
</P>
<P>
The three victories match the Wildcats' win total of the previous four seasons. 
The Wildcats scored 134 points last season. This year they already have 152.

VIRGINIA HAS SCHEDULE OF A CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the remaining undefeated teams with a chance at the national championship 
(sorry Fresno State), it appears that Virginia has the easiest path to an 11-0 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are no sure thing, but compared to unbeaten Notre Dame, Florida 
State, Nebraska, Tennessee and Auburn, they have the most accommodating 
schedule. Incidentally, Houston, Oklahoma and Florida are not included in this 
list of undefeated teams because they aren't eligible to compete in bowls this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Now then, consider each team's most difficult remaining opponents: 
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME -- Miami, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Three of the 
five games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA STATE -- Miami, Auburn, Louisiana State and Florida. The Miami and 
Auburn games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
NEBRASKA -- The Cornhuskers still have to play Oklahoma at Norman, Okla., and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE -- Florida, Alabama and Notre Dame. All three games are at home, but 
the Gators are tough; Alabama is Tennessee's fiercest rival, and Notre Dame is 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
AUBURN -- Florida State, Florida, Georgia and Alabama. If the Tigers can get 
past Florida State, they still have the Gators, at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
VIRGINIA -- North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Maryland. Not exactly 
murderer's row, is it? All three are home games, which doesn't make them 
gimmes, but . . . Fast-improving Georgia Tech could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's rise to No. 4 in the Associated Press poll is important to the 
Cavaliers for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's the highest football ranking in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could change the entire bowl picture. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
When the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which Virginia is a member, signed a 
four-year contract with the Florida Citrus Bowl in the summer of 1988, a 
stipulation was included in the agreement. It read that in the first and third 
years of the contract, the ACC champion was committed to the Citrus Bowl and 
vice versa. In the second and fourth years, the Citrus Bowl has the option of 
inviting the ACC champion or another team. This is year No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and this is where it gets interesting -- a national championship 
contingency exists. The Citrus Bowl can opt out of the agreement if it can 
match the No. 1-ranked team against No. 2, 3 or 4. Likewise, the ACC champion 
-- and let's say it's Virginia -- can opt out of the deal if its ranked no 
lower than fourth and can play the No. 1 team for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: The ACC champion can leave the Citrus only for the Sugar Bowl, 
Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. That's because the Citrus has no chance at the 
Southeastern Conference, Southwest Conference or Big Eight champions, all of 
which are tied to the aforementioned three bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl is off-limits because the Citrus considers it direct 
competition. The Fiesta has no conference tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the bowls would have a similar agreement, we'd have a national 
championship game every year," said Chuck Rohe, executive director of the 
Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. The Citrus Bowl will pay a projected $1.35 million to $1.5 million 
to its teams this year, which is considerably less than what a school could 
expect to earn by playing in, say, the Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. 
According to Rohe, if the Citrus has a chance at keeping Virginia for a 
national title contest, they would ask ABC, which is broadcasting the New 
Year's Day game, to increase the rights fee. ABC isn't under any obligation to 
do so, but you can bet it would if a championship game -- and championship 
ratings -- were available. 
</P>
<P>
No one really expected Florida to be able to strike a deal with the NCAA's 
Committee on Infractions, did they? The Gators basically wanted to devise their 
own punishment for past rules violations. Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
Recent NCAA sanctions against Florida, 4-0 this season, prohibit a bowl 
appearance after the 1990 season. Outraged Gator officials wanted to trade 12 
football scholarships for the chance to accept a bowl bid and bowl money. The 
committee heard Florida's appeal last weekend, but wasn't swayed. "(A 
university) can ask the Committee on Infractions whatever it wants to," the 
NCAA's David Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
Berst agreed the request was unusual. Not since 1952 has the NCAA removed an 
announced penalty. 
</P>
<P>
There is one solution to Florida's problem: Don't cheat. 
</P>
<P>
How seriously do they take their football at Alabama? When the Crimson Tide 
lost its first three games of the season, radio disc jockeys in Birmingham, 
Ala., and Tuscaloosa, Ala., began giving air time to "Dig Him Up," an awful 
ballad about retrieving the legendary Bear Bryant from his coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, especially new and beleaguered Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, deserves 
that sort of misguided abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And those sightings of Danny Ford at Alabama can be disregarded. Stallings is 
safe. Ford, a former Crimson Tide player who was forced out as Clemson's coach, 
is a welcome visitor, said Alabama Athletic Director Hootie Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
The coach who should be worrying is Mississippi State's Rocky Felker. Ford has 
been mentioned as a possible replacement for that struggling program. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's decision to play for a tie against Tennessee continues to receive 
mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Constitution columnist Steve Hummer listed a few of Dye's favorite 
things. Favorite food: Thai. Favorite storm: typhoon. Favorite cowboy lyric: 
"Yippie Tie Yie Yay." Favorite player: Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors agreed with the Auburn coach's move. 
And for what it's worth, so did Virginia's George Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
After Virginia Tech nearly upset No. 2-ranked Florida State at Tallahassee, 
Fla., Hokie quarterback Will Furrer asked a Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter: 
"Did we earn enough respect to get in the ACC?" Virginia Tech, which gained 411 
yards against the Seminoles, desperately wants an ACC invitation. It shouldn't 
hold its breath. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech isn't the only school that wants to jump on the ACC bandwagon. 
The Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl and newly approved Sunshine Bowl are all talking 
to the conference about an agreement once the Citrus Bowl deal ends after the 
1992 game. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Citrus Bowl is pushing for an extension. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to published reports, the Orange Bowl will not automatically follow 
Miami to whatever conference it might eventually join. "There's no commitment 
like that," said Bob Roller, Orange Bowl communications director. "They're not 
trailing Miami." 
</P>
<P>
It can't, mainly because the bowl's contract with the Big Eight runs through 
Jan. 1, 1995. The only way the agreement is voided is if any team leaves the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Florida State, (3) Auburn, (4) Michigan, (5) 
Oklahoma, (6) Virginia, (7) Nebraska, (8) Tennessee, (9) Miami, (10) Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Florida, USC, Houston, Oregon, BYU.

Bo Jackson, football's Mr. October, has finished his summer of baseball with 
the Kansas City Royals and is expected to join the Raiders soon. How soon? 
</P>
<P>
"Bo will let us know when he's going to arrive," Raider Coach Art Shell said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson usually takes a week or so to refuel his jets. Shell isn't saying how 
Jackson will be used in a backfield already stocked with Marcus Allen and Greg 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets here, he'll practice, he'll work and he'll get into the rotation 
like everyone else," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
Does Bo do anything like anyone else? 
</P>
<P>
Shell said defensive end Mike Wise's ankle is better, but no decision has been 
made on whether he'll play Sunday night against the Bills in Buffalo. CHRIS

NEWSWIRE: TARKANIAN OFFERS TO SIT OUT TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas said he would step down from coaching 
during the postseason tournament next spring and give up any personal revenue 
derived from the playoffs if the NCAA reverses itself and allows the Rebels to 
defend their national title. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said he made the decision July 23, three days after the NCAA handed 
down its penalty barring the defending national champions from postseason play 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said school officials wanted to wait to announce the concession until 
it was presented to the NCAA Infractions Committee but that he decided to 
disclose the decision because of speculation after an announcement by UNLV 
Tuesday that the Infractions Committee would reconsider the university's appeal 
Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said one issue was non-negotiable: "I'll never step down from 
coaching."

COURT RULING ALLOWS BEAR HUNT TO BEGIN AS SCHEDULED ON OCT. 13

Bears became fair game in California again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When Superior Court Judge Cecily Bond said that the 1990 black bear hunt 
proposed by the Fish and Game Commission could go ahead as scheduled Oct. 
13-Dec. 30, it was the first legal victory for hunters against the anti-hunting 
coalition in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Bond denied a writ sought by the animal rights groups that a document prepared 
by the Department of Fish and Game's biologists inadequately fulfilled 
obligations of the California Environmental Quality Act. Earlier, hunters lost 
mountain lion, tule elk and the '89 bear hunt in a string of five court 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG was authorized by the commission to issue up to 15,000 bear tags -- the 
state bear population is estimated at 15,000-18,000 -- but the hunt will be 
stopped when the first 1,250 are killed. The average kill through 1988 was 
1,245 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The hunters may use dogs to track and tree bears but can't take female bears 
with cubs or bears smaller than 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no archery hunting of bears. RICH ROBERTS

CHARGERS' BUTTS IS FAST ENOUGH, OK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Our mission today is to determine the actual speed of Charger running back 
Marion Butts. 
</P>
<P>
He's being vague about his time in the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
"It varies," he said. "I didn't really have a real good time, because my leg 
was hurting a little bit. I can't really say, but you know you run faster with 
someone after you than just running by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, with the Chargers (1-3) running after almost everybody in the 
league, Butts is a splash of stability in an offense that is searching for 
answers, not to mention points. In four games, he has transported his 248 
pounds over 329 yards in 70 carries, a 4.7-yard average. He has more than twice 
as many yards as anybody else who has carried the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Butts was drafted in the seventh round last year and wound up as the team's 
leading rusher with 683 yards in 170 carries, a 4.0-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, he's not the least bit slow, particularly considering he's as big 
as a linebacker. So he doesn't really have anything to hide, which brings us 
brings us back to the 40. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in the 4.5s," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "There's never been a 
question about his speed. For a big guy like that, I bet he's as fast as any 
guy that size in the league." 
</P>
<P>
As for Butts' claim that he runs faster against the opponent than he does 
against the clock, Henning isn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people do," Henning said. "You ever see a quarterback run after a guy 
after he's intercepted a pass? One guy's running for a touchdown, the other 
guy's running for his job." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to Billy Joe Tolliver, who readily admits he couldn't keep up 
with Butts in a foot race. 
</P>
<P>
"He's faster than most quarterbacks," Tolliver said. 
</P>
<P>
But faster than you? 
</P>
<P>
"Barely," Tolliver said, smiling. "I'm a pretty fast guy." 
</P>
<P>
And Tolliver's time for the 40? 
</P>
<P>
"Five flat, if you must know," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad . . . for a nose guard. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Tolliver is glad to have Butts behind him. Presure comes in many forms 
when you're a second-year quarterback on an offense that is averaging only 
slightly more than 15 points a game. Butts' steady running provides a little 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it a lot easier knowing that any time the guy could break one," 
Tolliver said. "You kind of want to keep giving him the ball, because you never 
can tell when it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
It happened Sunday in the Chargers' 17-7 loss to Houston. In the middle of one 
of many struggles to get near the end zone, Butts burst through the middle and 
broke outside for a 42-yard gain, which gave the Chargers first and 10 at 
Houston's 25 midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the rest, that drive stalled when the Chargers self-destructed 
inside the 20. Tolliver was sacked and threw two incomplete passes, and Fuad 
Reveiz -- check the waiver wire -- missed a field goal from 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Someday soon, the offense may mature and provide Butts with some assistance. 
Until then, he plans to continue his own process of strict self-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can be satisfied with what they do regardless of whether they have a 
magnificent day or not," he said. "They can look at the film and say 'Wow, I 
could have picked up five extra yards there.' You know, you're never really 
pleased."

MORSE: A DATE WITH GREATNESS?; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: COACH JOHN SHACKLETT WON'T SAY IF THIS IS THE BEST HE'S HAD, 'BUT 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A HELL OF A BALLCLUB TO BEAT US.'

<TEXT>
<P>
Homecoming at Morse is Nov. 2, and the quarterback of the best high school 
football team in the county doesn't have a date for the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Lawrence isn't really worried, but two weeks from now, he might be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared that I'm going to ask too late," he said. "You go around and ask a 
certain amount of girls, and then they're going to say: 'Teddy's stressing for 
a date. He needs a date bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
How is it that a guy who gets so many recruiting letters that he doesn't even 
bother to read them anymore is dateless for the big dance of fall? 
</P>
<P>
"I think Teddy's kind of shy," Morse lineman Salua Poutoa said. "Teddy's the 
shy type. But he'll get a date." 
</P>
<P>
Probably so, but that may be the biggest challenge he faces until the section 
playoffs. Top-ranked Morse (4-0) is crushing its opponents as if they were wine 
grapes, and the toughest part of its season is already over. In a rematch of 
last year's 3-A championship game Sept. 7, Morse pounded Rancho Buena Vista, 
28-14, to paste a pleasant memory over last season's 21-7 loss in the final. 
</P>
<P>
John Shacklett has coached at Morse since 1971, won two 3-A championships and 
been runner-up two other times, but this is something a bit different. Morse is 
so good that it has piqued the curiosity of an entire community. Of course, 
like all coaches, Shacklett fidgets when asked if this is his greatest team, 
but you get the idea that if it came to picking one, this would be his choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a team that has gotten off this quickly, and I've had some good 
teams in the past," he said. "I don't want to get too rambunctious about 
predictions right now. We've got a good ballclub, and it's going to take a hell 
of a ballclub to beat us. I don't know if there's one out there right now that 
can." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine there is, considering that Lawrence and running back Gary 
Taylor are the top two rushers in the county. Lawrence has 504 yards in 27 
carries for an 18.7 average. Taylor, a junior whose dad wouldn't let him play 
varsity last year because he was too small, has 887 yards in 58 carries for a 
15.3 average. That's 222 yards a game, and Taylor, who jumped from 155 pounds 
to 168 since last year, has another season remaining. Scary. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in five returning offensive lineman, including Poutoa, who at 290 has 
never been told he's too small to do anything, and a defense that is plenty 
good enough to complement (and compliment) an offense averaging 49 points a 
game, and this team looks capable of providing Shacklett with his first 
undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
Morse fans are gobbling it up. Shacklett keeps getting calls from people who 
ask: "Who are you playing this week?" And then they want to know how good his 
team really is. Section champs, maybe? Best in state, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
All this is fun, but Shacklett is feeling the pressure that goes with the 
excitement of being the best team in town. The other day in a meeting with his 
coaches, he got "a little fired up" when it was suggested that maybe Morse 
should put a few new wrinkles in its plan for this Saturday's game against 
Lincoln. Morse had a bye last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm concerned about getting the kids moving again," he said. "So I put 
some pressure on myself for this ballgame. They (the assistant coaches) said: 
'We want to do this, and we want to do that.' I said: 'No, We're not doing 
anything new this week. We're going to do the same thing we've done the last 
four ball games.' I kind of told them off, and I realized at the time that I'd 
gotten myself kind of worked up about the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of concern may not be necessary. Lincoln (0-4) is off to its worst 
start since 1969, and even Shacklett concedes this shouldn't be much of a game 
if Morse plays up to its capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a competitive game, but quite honestly, it's never been this 
lopsided on paper," he said. "I'm more worried about our players being too 
keyed up. We played the worst game of the entire season last year against 
Lincoln, and it's all because I probably didn't do a very good job of settling 
them down." 
</P>
<P>
Too ready can be as bad as not ready enough. Psychology is something for a 
coach to fret about. Ask a player, particularly a high school player, and he 
wants only to play. Tee it up, kick it off, and get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
For Lawrence, there isn't much to analyze. He says simply: "I don't think 
there's any team in the state that can beat us." 
</P>
<P>
And if that's true, it's largely because of him. He has taken advantage of his 
athletic gifts and decided he can live with playing quarterback for a little 
while longer. Lawrence, you see, wanted to be a wide receiver, but Shacklett 
figured last season that this was a player who should be getting his hands on 
the ball a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for him," Shacklett said. "He wasn't convinced he wanted to be a 
quarterback. He was a quarterback because his coach wanted him to be a 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Now he is a quarterback because he wants to be a quarterback. At least until 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I want to play quarterback in college," said Lawrence, who has 
been recruited by Washington, San Diego State, UCLA and Colorado, among others. 
"I like it. It's fun. But I don't think I can get to the NFL playing 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
That might sound a little pretentious for a high school player, but Shacklett 
says Lawrence is a rare discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hell of an athlete," Shacklett said. "He has an ability to make the big 
play, and it looks so natural." 
</P>
<P>
So naturally, he's getting a lot of attention. One teacher made photo copies of 
an article that had appeared in the newspaper about Lawrence and had each 
student read it. 
</P>
<P>
Has he become a celebrity? 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to recognize me like I'm Michael Jordan or something," 
Lawrence said. "If somebody says 'This is Teddy Lawrence,' they'll say 'Oh, so 
you're Teddy Lawrence.' " 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin boards at Morse are covered with accounts of each week's 
victories. After the Rancho Buena Vista game, Taylor awoke at 6 a.m. when he 
heard commotion in the living room. Who? His parents. With every newspaper they 
could find spread out all over the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us, by way of the back door, back to Poutoa, who would like it to 
be known that the offensive line has something to do with all of this. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I read about Teddy and Gary I just look at it and say 'Yeah, they 
wouldn't have had all that if it wasn't for us,' " he said. "I just want 
everybody to know that the offensive line gets a little bit of the credit." 
</P>
<P>
Aw, what's your gripe, Salua? You've got a date to the homecoming dance, don't 
you? 
</P>
<P>
Poutoa: "Oh yeah, I have a date." 
</P>
<P>
Two, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
Poutoa: "I'll take one to homecoming and I'll take the other one to the 
Sweetheart Ball." 
</P>
<P>
Now the only concern is Lawrence, who is undoubtedly a good bet to find a date. 
After all, it's not as if there isn't interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's more girls liking me than before," he said. "Most of them 
don't tell me. People come up to me and say 'So and so likes you, but they're 
scared because they don't know what you're like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Funny how that works. Most defensive players in the county are scared because 
they know exactly what he's like.

STARTLING LEAP IN OIL PRICES LEAVES TRADERS BAFFLED; 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: LOWER U.S. RESERVES AND SPECULATION ABOUT A CANCELED SPEECH PLAY A 
ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Abruptly ending two days of sharp declines, crude oil prices soared more than 
$3 a barrel Wednesday on news of lower U.S. oil reserves and speculation 
surrounding the postponement of a U.N. speech by the Iraqi ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
But surprised traders were hard-pressed to account for the intensity of the 
rebound, which erased more than half the $5.56-a-barrel that crude oil dropped 
Monday and Tuesday after messages from President Bush and Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein eased fears of war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the EKG of a guy who just got cardiac shock," said William 
Byers, managing director of commodities futures research at Bear Stearns &amp; 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for November delivery closed up $3.37 a barrel at $37.32 Wednesday in 
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices of refined products also 
closed much higher. Crude oil for delivery in later months closed up, though to 
a lesser degree. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices opened higher, as expected, Wednesday morning in the wake of a 
report late Tuesday by the industry's main trade group, the American Petroleum 
Institute, which showed that U.S. crude oil reserves had fallen by 9.4 million 
barrels from the week before, the third consecutive week of declines. 
</P>
<P>
The large drawdown, which brought stocks to 354.6 million barrels in the week 
ended Sept. 28, partly reflected lower imports and was concentrated on the West 
Coast, an API spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Additionally, there was a counter-seasonal drop in heating oil stocks, which 
was not expected," said Peter Beutel, an oil industry analyst with the Pegasus 
Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "Normally, you don't see a drop in 
stocks until mid-December." 
</P>
<P>
But the statistics were not sufficient to raise oil prices more than $1 or so 
-- crude stocks still remain about 20 million barrels above levels a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were driven up partly on statements by Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III that foreign ministers of several nations had indicated that they would not 
oppose military action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
After rising initially, prices held steady at around $35.50 a barrel for most 
of the day. They started to climb again in late afternoon after traders got 
word that Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir Al Anbari had postponed an address before 
the United Nations for the second time this week. 
</P>
<P>
Although no reason for the postponement was given, traders immediately 
interpreted the move as bullish. 
</P>
<P>
"People were expecting him to come out and make a conciliatory speech," said 
Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy Inc. in New York, "and when he 
canceled," traders started buying crude contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Prices surged strongly in the last hour of trading as commodity houses, fund 
managers and others bought heavily, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Traders also may have been reacting to a flurry of news reports out of the 
Middle East: that Saddam Hussein toured Iraqi-occupied Kuwait to boost troop 
morale, that French and Japanese leaders were in the Middle East, and that 
Palestinian guerrilla leader Abul Abass threatened terrorist acts in reaction 
to the U.S.-led embargo of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But after the close, analysts were loathe to say that Wednesday's movement 
signaled any shift in the market's psychology, which remains skittish and 
emotional. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're left with right now is an extremely volatile market that moves on 
the slightest information, whether a rumor on a psychological level, or whether 
a technical factor, or a fundamental report, even from the API," Beutel said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's rebound "was a normal correction of a very steep decline," Byers 
added. "There was a snowball effect (on the way down), which carried it too 
far, and today's trading was more or less a natural reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline for November delivery closed up 6.21 cents a gallon at 93.14 
cents. Gasoline for delivery in later months also rose. 
</P>
<P>
Home heating oil for November delivery closed up 7.38 cents at 99.41 cents a 
gallon. Heating oil for delivery in December and later also closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, instability in crude oil prices was blamed for the continuing 
decline in California crude oil production, which fell in 1989 for the fourth 
year in a row, the California Energy Commission reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oil production in the state was 364.3 million barrels in 1989, down from 387 
million barrels in 1988. The low point in recent years was 1980's production of 
346.9 million barrels, the commission reported.

Most Great American Offices to Be Kept: Wells Fargo Bank said it plans to

Semiconductor Firm May Be Sold: San Jose-based Spectra Diode Labs, a joint 
venture of Xerox and Ciba-Geigy that claims to be the premier supplier of 
advanced high power semiconductor laser devices and related systems, said it 
engaged Salomon Bros. to evaluate future business strategies, including a 
possible sale of the business. Spectra Diode Labs was formed in 1983 to exploit 
gallium arsenide-based, solid-state laser technology developed at Xerox's Palo 
Alto Research Center.

MATSUSHITA REPORTEDLY WON'T BID FOR MCA PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has decided to 
buy MCA Inc.'s film and music divisions for $6 billion, leaving out the theme 
park business, according to Japan's leading economic journal. 
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoting unnamed Matsushita sources, reported today that 
MCA has told Matsushita that it wants more than $7.53 billion for all of its 
divisions except its New York-area television station, WWOR. 
</P>
<P>
If realized, the deal would be the largest purchase of an American firm by a 
Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press in Tokyo reported today that Matsushita executives will 
begin direct negotiations with MCA Inc. officials as the Japanese firm pursues 
a buyout of the Los Angeles entertainment conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, we have been approached by MCA through a third agent, but we 
finally reached the stage of direct negotiations," the AP quoted Matsushita 
spokeswoman Toshiko Inui as saying. Matsushita will send its executives to the 
United States soon to negotiate with MCA representatives for a possible 
agreement, the AP said, adding that Inui would not elaborate on the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Another company spokesman, Toshiyuki Nakahara, would not confirm or deny the 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun or AP reports, however. He told The Times that Matsushita 
would continue to pursue negotiations with MCA but that "there is no assurance 
these contacts will lead to any merger." He would not comment on whether direct 
negotiations would commence soon. 
</P>
<P>
With its 163 consolidated subsidiaries, Matsushita Electric is Japan's 
third-largest corporation and the world's 16th largest in 1989, according to 
Fortune magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment, in large part 
to gain control over the American movie studio's rich library of old films and 
television shows. Analysts say purchases of film libraries allow consumer 
electronics companies to release old movies and television shows in the format 
for videotape recorders they manufacture, a key sales strategy, and also 
provide material for future high-definition television recordings. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's stock rose $3.875 a share Wednesday to close at $63.50 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. MCA was trading for about $34 per share before reports of a 
possible deal surfaced Sept. 25. Matsushita's stock has risen to 1,920 yen 
($14) Wednesday from 1,630 yen ($12) on Sept. 25 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Record U.S. Housing Bailout: The government will take over a luxury high-rise 
development in Chicago that borrowed almost $159 million in federally backed 
money in what officials called the biggest-ever bailout in the Federal Housing 
Administration's mortgage insurance program. U.S. housing officials and 
developers of the financially troubled Presidential Towers apartments failed to 
meet an Oct. 1 deadline to agree on a proposed $16-million loan to help the 
project stay solvent, both sides said.

SUNBELT SAVINGS GETS $464-MILLION AWARD IN FRAUD LAWSUITS

<P>
A federal judge has awarded a Dallas thrift more than $464 million in damages 
stemming from civil fraud and racketeering lawsuits against the borrowers from 
an associate institution. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer ordered the award to Sunbelt Savings of 
Dallas on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The action was the result of lawsuits accusing borrowers of defrauding Western 
Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Western is one of eight insolvent Texas thrifts combined to form Sunbelt in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits charged that Richard Dover and John Ballis illegally appropriated 
loans from Western Savings with the help of the savings and loan owner Jarrett 
Woods. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunbelt lawsuit accused Dover and attorney John Riddle of completing a 
series of real estate transactions known as "land flips." 
</P>
<P>
The land flips raised the value of property, the lawsuit charges, and created 
illusory profits for Western Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Ballis was accused of borrowing more than $55 million from Western Savings to 
acquire raw land for commercial and residential developments.

<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief William Reese this week told city officials that he plans to 
retire, the latest twist in a brouhaha that erupted when the sons of several 
community leaders were arrested last month at a noisy drinking party. 
</P>
<P>
His departure adds one more ingredient to the intrigue that has been brewing 
since the Sept. 14 bash, with one of the suspects hurling charges of police 
misconduct, the police alleging political meddling and the City Council hiring 
a $50-an-hour private investigator to straighten it all out. 
</P>
<P>
Residents' complaints have been filed, internal memos are flying and a copy of 
the police report -- given to The Times by an anonymous source -- was 
confiscated by a top police official after a reporter asked him to verify its 
authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the storm are four young South Pasadena men accused of 
disturbing the peace and resisting arrest: John Bernardi Jr., 22, son of the 
city manager; Bryan Lee Prentiss, 22, son of the former mayor; Thomas D. Ramos, 
20, son of the former Chamber of Commerce president, and Scott D. Josephson, 
21. 
</P>
<P>
Although the suspects were ordered to appear in Pasadena Municipal Court on 
Oct. 15., the district attorney's office has not filed charges and has sent the 
case back to the Police Department for more investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Officers, who were called to the Ramos family's Stratford Avenue home by irate 
neighbors about 11:30 p.m., contend that the party-goers were loud, belligerent 
and unwilling to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
Several times, according to the 10-page police report, Bernardi Jr. allegedly 
threatened to call his father, maintaining that the city manager would have the 
officers fired for so rudely ending the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll call my dad," police quoted him as saying. "You can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
But in a complaint hand-delivered by Bernardi Sr. to the police chief last 
week, Bernardi Jr. contends that officers were overly aggressive, allegedly 
pushing him, kicking him and jamming a billy club into the back of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"The music was at a moderate level and the crowd was very relaxed and quiet," 
Bernardi Jr. wrote. "The police came . . . with a vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
Reese, a 29-year veteran and chief for the last 5 1/2 years, did not return 
calls from The Times. City officials, who were scheduled to discuss his 
departure in a closed session after Wednesday night's council meeting, said 
that Reese had already been considering retirement but that the current 
controversy probably helped make up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between his department and City Hall have been strained since the 
arrests, as word began to spread through town that police had allegedly used a 
heavy hand to break up the party. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old USC student showed up in tears at the city manager's office, 
describing what she considered to be harassment and verbal abuse by the 
officers that night, officials said. The woman, who has filed a complaint, 
declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Concern was amplified because one City Council member's son -- described as a 
"real straight-and-narrow type of kid" -- was also at the party and gave an 
unflattering account of police actions, according to a City Hall source who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after the incident, the council, following the city attorney's 
advice, voted in closed session to hire a private investigator to conduct an 
independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted an objective way of getting to the bottom of this and have no 
appearance at all of favoritism," Mayor Evelyn Fierro said. "This is a very 
sensitive situation." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney in charge of personnel matters recommended hiring Brian 
Schubert, a former Pomona police lieutenant and a private detective since his 
retirement in 1989. Bernardi Sr., the city manager, said he called Schubert on 
Sept. 21, then signed a purchase order authorizing payment of up to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired Mr. Schubert, but I'm only in there as a paper shuffler," said 
Bernardi, adding that he urged his son not to file a complaint. "I'm not 
involved in this investigation, I'm not part of it and I'm not orchestrating 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But the South Pasadena Police Officers Assn., which represents most of the 
department's 31 officers, as well as some reserves and dispatchers, was 
shocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged that these city officials have chosen to circumvent the 
internal affairs process, that they are using public funds for this purpose and 
that there is so clearly a conflict of interest," wrote association President 
Mark Miller in a Sept. 24 memo to his fellow officers. "We are deeply 
disappointed that the mayor and her City Council apparently have no faith or 
trust in the officers of this department." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they were concerned that such a small department would not 
be able to fairly investigate its own, or at least convince a skeptical public 
that "the fox was not tending the chicken coop," as one city official put it. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, at the council's request, is already 
investigating a complaint of police brutality by 19-year-old Julian Mercado, 
who was arrested for allegedly assaulting an officer and obstructing justice 
during another South Pasadena party in April. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're furious," Fierro said of the police force, "but to me, this is 
really more protective of the officers involved. If it was done internally, it 
would look like it was biased, or fixed." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, nine South Pasadena police officers and two San Marino patrolmen 
responded to the Sept. 14 party in the 1100 block of Stratford Avenue, a quiet, 
tree-lined street of older wood homes with stone porches. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complained that unsupervised parties had been going on at the Ramos 
home for years, the report said, and that gatherings the three weeks before the 
party had been particularly rowdy. One neighbor said that she regularly wears 
earplugs to bed to block the noise. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ramos family could not be reached for comment, nor could any of 
the four suspects. But in the police report, Thomas Ramos allegedly told 
officers: "I can't help it if I'm surrounded by a bunch of old people." 
</P>
<P>
Police, who entered through a rear patio, said there were about 30 to 40 people 
at the party, with loud music pouring through the open windows and many 
containers of beer and wine scattered about. 
</P>
<P>
Officers asked Ramos to reduce the noise, but they contend that he ignored them 
and the party continued "unabated." Finally, they walked into the kitchen 
through a rear door and arrested Ramos for disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the party allegedly surrounded the officers, shouting that they had 
no right to arrest their friend, the report said. More police entered, pushing 
their way through the crowd, with Miller -- the police association president -- 
threatening to spray the party-goers with his tear-gas canister if they did not 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Prentiss was confronted in the family room and ordered to leave. When he 
refused, police handcuffed him, according to the report. Josephson was arrested 
as he tried to make a telephone call. Bernardi Jr. was arrested outside, 
allegedly shouting expletives at the police and again threatening to call his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
"This town's a real soap opera from time to time," Councilman James C. Hodge 
Jr. commented. "But hopefully this will all blow over soon."

OVERNIGHT PARKING BAN ENDANGERED;

PASADENA: WANT A PERMIT? CLAIM A 'BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND' SITUATION. RESIDENTS

<P>
The city's 35-year-old ban against overnight parking -- vigorously enforced 
since July to improve city street sweeping -- may itself be swept off the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Directors on Tuesday asked for a re-evaluation of the law, with 
some directors calling it a regulation that may have outlived its usefulness. 
Others said the law allows police intrusion into the private lives of Pasadena 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We should look at the underlying policy," Director John Crowley said. "Is it 
still valid as it was in the 1950s?" 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole called the current parking ban "an arcane and inequitable 
application of the law that works better in some places than others." 
</P>
<P>
"A blanket policy no longer works," Cole said. Instead, he suggested 
prohibiting overnight parking only on narrow or steep streets. 
</P>
<P>
The city's law against parking on city streets between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. was 
passed in the mid-1950s, Pasadena Police Lt. Robert Huff told the directors 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure why the ordinance was passed," Huff said. But he added the Police 
Department believes that the ordinance helps keep streets clear for street 
sweeping crews, helps reduce the number of abandoned and derelict vehicles on 
city streets, and aids in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
For those who lack parking space and must place their cars overnight on city 
streets, permits are issued on approval by the Police Department for a fee of 
$36 yearly, Huff said. He said permits are also issued in special 
circumstances, such as a "boyfriend-girlfriend situation." 
</P>
<P>
There are no specific criteria, and permits are issued on a case-by-case basis. 
Residents must give their reasons for seeking the permit. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 3,000 permits are issued annually and about 500 denied. Last year's 
fees totaled $76,532, he said. An additional $350,000 was collected from 
violators who paid $20 citations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the use of two police assistants who nightly patrol city streets and 
issue citations, city crews over the years found the streets increasingly 
blocked by overnight vehicles. So, in July, four Public Works Department 
employees also began issuing citations as part of a yearlong pilot program to 
clear the streets for sweeping machinery, said Ivory Herrin, a city 
administrator in charge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,000 cars were illegally parked nightly before the program began, 
he said. That number has been reduced by about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not working as well as we had hoped," Herrin said. "We've still got a 
long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
But the sudden increase in enforcement prompted complaints in August that 
spurred the directors to take a second look at the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, resident Lou Richards said he was outraged that police should 
inquire into the private lives of Pasadena residents. "The questions they ask 
are none of their business," Richards said of police. "I'm surprised no one has 
challenged them." 
</P>
<P>
Director William Paparian agreed, suggesting that the city stop such inquiries 
and simply post signs advising when street crews will sweep. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members were directed to survey neighborhood associations to garner 
public opinion on the ordinance and gather information on similar ordinances in 
other cities. The survey and staff report is expected to take months.

COUNCILMAN WANTS FAIR ON BULLET-TRAIN FAST TRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Having refurbished its monorail this year, the Los Angeles County Fair is being 
asked to consider a new high-tech transportation venture: a bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona City Council this week approved Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer's 
suggestion that it ask the L.A. County Fair Assn. board to explore the idea of 
using the fairgrounds as a station for a proposed high-speed train route 
between Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said Pomona would be a better location than a proposed stop at Ontario 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Sid Robinson, spokesman for the fair, said the idea is so new that fair 
officials haven't had time to consider it. MIKE WARD

The City Council on Tuesday approved the development of a $300,000 sports 
complex to be used by the Monrovia Youth Baseball League at Santa Fe 
Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
Construction will begin this month on the complex, which includes baseball 
fields, bleachers, two scoreboards and portable fencing. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Brownell, director of community services, told the council she hopes the 
complex will be completed in time for the 1991 baseball season, beginning in 
February. A concession stand will be rented for the first year, and a permanent 
concession stand is scheduled to be built next summer, she said.

AUTO THEFT PROGRAM TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting Saturday, Alhambra residents can take advantage of a free program to 
crack down on auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
The "Combat Auto Theft" program is already in operation in other cities, 
including Monrovia, Ventura, Van Nuys and Anaheim. Participating drivers place 
a special decal in their car's right rear window and sign a document promising 
not to drive between the hours of 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. A patrol officer who spots 
a car with a decal on the road between those hours will be alerted to a 
possible stolen vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
City officials will begin registering residents for the program Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the parking lot on the north side of City Hall, 111 S. 1st 
St.

TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighborhoods that draw complaints about repeated traffic violations will be 
targeted with signs and special police enforcement under a new program approved 
Tuesday by the City Council. The blue signs, which feature a silhouette of a 
police motorcycle, say "Special Traffic Enforcement Area" and ask motorists to 
"Please Obey All Laws." 
</P>
<P>
They will be posted in areas with traffic problems such as speeding or failure 
to stop for stop signs, Police Capt. Robert Page said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the signs, there will be a heavy police presence in those areas for 
30 days, Page said. If the traffic problems do not diminish, the program can be 
extended. Up to 10 special enforcement areas can be established in the city at 
one time, Page said.

HOUSING REHABILITATION PLAN

<P>
After a two-year absence, the city's Housing Rehabilitation Program is on its 
way back to help low- and moderate-income families improve their homes with a 
number of loans and grants. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously voted Monday to take the first steps toward 
re-establishing the program, which was discontinued because of lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
The program, expected to be in operation by January, would provide assistance 
with repairs including painting, yard cleanup, plumbing and electrical work, 
roofing, and room additions. 
</P>
<P>
Robb Steel, Azusa's redevelopment director, said 50% of the city's housing 
units require minor or major repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The city is hoping to fund the program with $50,000 from its own budget, 
$223,307 from a county grant and $250,000 from a state loan program.

WAR VETERANS MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black polished granite wall monument memorializing war veterans will be 
erected in the city and paid for with private donations, the City Council 
decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Names of Monterey Park residents killed in action will be engraved on the 
monument, which was suggested by resident Frank Arcuri. The monument will cost 
about $10,000, said Mayor Judy Chu. No location has been chosen yet. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a monument was proposed several years ago but was suspended in 
1989 when then-Mayor Barry Hatch pushed for a city-funded $50,000 statue of 
George Washington in front of City Hall instead. The Washington statue proposal 
foundered when some residents objected because it would replace a 15-foot-high 
sculpture of the Olympic torch.

PASADENA TO CONSIDER REGULATING GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the city manager's recommendation against it, the Board of Directors on 
Tuesday asked for more information to assess whether Pasadena should regulate 
private, uniformed guards and the companies that employ them. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had an ordinance on the books it wouldn't have prevented (Robert Earl) 
Holloway's death, but we need to explore the issue more fully," City Director 
William Paparian said. 
</P>
<P>
The board in June asked for information on city laws pertaining to security 
guards in the wake of resident complaints of city inaction after Holloway's 
death in January. Accused of trespassing at the King's Villages housing project 
in Northwest Pasadena, Holloway, 28, died Jan. 18 of strangulation after 
fighting with five security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Both the district attorney and the state attorney general declined to file 
criminal charges against the guards or their employer, Gold Security Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, City Manager Philip Hawkey told directors that state licensing laws 
regulating private security firms prevent the city from passing laws of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"The city by ordinance does have some limited jurisdiction . . . just an 
inventory of who is doing work and the patrols they would follow," Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
But even such limited city regulation could discourage reputable security firms 
from doing business in Pasadena, Hawkey said. In addition, such a law could 
expose the city to lawsuits if a mishap or death occurred at the hands of 
security guards, Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, city directors asked for a survey of the number of guard firms in 
the city and the companies' opinions of possible city regulations. The 
regulations could include requirements that security firms provide the names of 
their guards, the state licenses held by the guards, the routes to be followed 
by guard patrol cars and the radio frequencies used.

Director Chris Holden also asked for an analysis of the city's ability to 
create tighter restrictions on security guards at housing projects such as 
King's Villages. The city in 1982 purchased King's Villages from the federal 
Housing and Urban Development Department and sold it to Goldrich, Kest &amp; 
Associates, a private management company.

ONE EAST L.A. AVENUE, WITH 4 MEN ON DUTY IN MIDEAST, IS A STREET OF STARS AND 
STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Out on La Verne Avenue in East Los Angeles, a working-class neighborhood of 
worn stucco homes where the Spanish language is a part of everyday life, the 
residents have learned a new geographical term -- El Golfo Persico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Their interest is understandable. Four of their sons -- who consider home to be 
two blocks of La Verne sandwiched between Whittier and Olympic boulevards -- 
have been sent to the Middle East hot spot. And two others, both Marines who 
grew up in the same stretch of La Verne, are stationed in safe enough places, 
for now. But as their parents know, that could change. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Department spokesman said there is no way of knowing whether a 
particular street or neighborhood in the United States has sent an 
extraordinary number of men and women to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't even confirm anything, even if we knew," the spokesman said. "But 
there may be some areas, places that have more personnel deployed (to the 
Persian Gulf) than others." 
</P>
<P>
On La Verne, residents say there is no need for confirmation. The street has 
done its share. 
</P>
<P>
The parents said they received telephone calls and letters from their sons, 
informing them of their deployment as part of the U.S. effort to force Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein to give up his country's occupation of tiny Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the roll call on La Verne: 
</P>
<P>
* Timothy Reyes, 20, Navy. 
</P>
<P>
* Adrian Yracheta, 21, Army. 
</P>
<P>
* William Martinez, 20, Army. 
</P>
<P>
* Manuel Castro, 23, Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The two other La Verne servicemen, although not in the Middle East, also merit 
mention in the eyes of the folks on the street because they have chosen to be 
in the military. They are Joe Villarreal Jr., a 21-year-old Marine, and 
19-year-old John Chavez, who joined the Corps four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although some parents admit that they fear for their sons, their pride in the 
young men and their roots in the neighborhood is evident. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so proud of him," Rachel Reyes said of her son Timothy. "I mean proud. 
. . . You know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Irene Yracheta, who works at the nearby Lupe's Hamburgers stand: "It is 
just a proud feeling to know that Mexicanos want to serve. I think it's an 
honor to serve this country." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking it over a moment more, she added, "If I were a man and if I was able 
to, I know I'd go." 
</P>
<P>
The pride of some parents is so great that Rachel Reyes, for example, hoisted a 
large U.S. flag and a Navy SEAL banner -- her son is a member of that elite 
sea-air-land commando group -- over her home at 1030 S. La Verne shortly after 
President Bush announced the deployment of U.S. forces to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking them down until my Timmy comes home," she vowed. 
</P>
<P>
Others have taken to wearing U.S. flag lapel pins or displaying yellow ribbons 
outside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes has not been afraid to promote La Verne's pride in the four, even at 
public demonstrations where protesters have questioned U.S. involvement in the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
At the Aug. 25 Chicano Moratorium march on Whittier Boulevard, which marked the 
20th anniversary of the violent anti-Vietnam War protest, Reyes and a friend 
hauled the Navy SEAL banner up to the boulevard and flaunted it in the faces of 
the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a bunch of b.s.," she growled at the time. "Our sons are overseas 
while these people are doing this. This is the banner that they (marchers) 
ought to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has lived in the area for 18 years, William Martinez's mother is 
not well known along La Verne. A native of Cuba, Maria Martinez is just 
learning where the Persian Gulf is. 
</P>
<P>
"We watch TV a lot for news and pray," said Martinez, who is described by 
another son, Miguel, as being "Stars and Stripes all the way" because of son 
William's presence with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Castro's mother recently moved away from La Verne Avenue, but the 
sailor's home of record -- as the military refers to one's street address -- 
will always be a converted garage, a stone's throw from Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you live here," one resident crowed, "you're always from here. That's 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The four young servicemen in the gulf are remembered in the area as good sons, 
even if they did not all go to the area's well-known school, Garfield High. 
Timothy Reyes' attendance at Montebello High School and Adrian Yracheta's 
education at a Fresno high school are not held against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess they're good schools," La Verne resident Juan Gomez sniffed. 
"Anyone from this area would improve them," he said of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents along La Verne seem to take in stride the fact that a seemingly 
high number of young men from that little barrio are in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us heard talk about the mijos (an affectionate Spanish term that means 
'our sons')," Jose Gutierrez, a 60ish-looking La Verne resident, said between 
sips of cold beer in a Whittier Boulevard bar. "My boy went to Vietnam. I got a 
brother who went to Korea. I guess a lot of us really don't think about that 
much, because so many of us go into the military. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not these boys too?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Chicano historians are fond of pointing to the tradition of Latinos 
serving in the military with distinction, with some Mexican-Americans even 
tracing their families' military tradition back to the French occupation of 
Mexico during the American Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
For example, more Mexican-American soldiers received the Medal of Honor in 
World War II than any other ethnic group. During the Vietnam War, while 
Chicanos made up only 10% of the population in the U.S. Southwest, they 
accounted for nearly 20% of all casualties from that region. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of the four servicemen in the Persian Gulf, as well as those of the 
two Marines, go about the business of everyday life, trying not to let their 
sons' safety worry them too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost a brother who was in the Marine Corps in Vietnam," said Steve Reyes, 
Rachel's husband. "My son knows that I'm proud of him. It would be a great loss 
(if he dies in the Gulf), but I would know that he served his country." 
</P>
<P>
The parents seem to take the attitude of many who send off sons and daughters 
to a dangerous situation -- be supportive, be hopeful, and put an offspring's 
destiny into the hands of the Almighty. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever it has to be, it has to be," said Irene Yracheta, Adrian's mother. 
"It's a terrible thing to have them over there. But if it wasn't him, then it 
would be someone else. And everybody has a mom or a wife. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in God's hands."

SERGEANT WORKED FOR DEFENSE TEAM WHILE ON DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: OFFICER WAS AN INVESTIGATOR FOR FOUR COLLEAGUES ACCUSED IN DALTON 
AVENUE RAID. HE SAYS HE HAD APPROVAL, BUT THE DEPARTMENT DENIES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A veteran Los Angeles police sergeant, while on duty, spent weeks this summer 
working as an investigator for four officers charged with vandalism in the 
"39th and Dalton" case, and said he did so with the approval of his Police 
Department supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Robert Kavanaugh said he was so involved in trying to exonerate his fellow 
officers that beginning Aug. 1, he worked almost daily for six weeks in the law 
offices of one of the defendants' attorneys. His work for the defense included 
conducting stakeouts, interviewing potential witnesses and doing other research 
for use when the officers stand trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant said he was paid his city salary during the defense work -- which 
means taxpayers are paying the police to work not only for the prosecution but 
also the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from a drug raid two years ago in South-Central Los Angeles, 
where officers allegedly destroyed property in a group of apartment units near 
39th Street and Dalton Avenue. Four officers have been charged with criminal 
misconduct and about 30 others are awaiting disciplinary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh said he helped the defense because he and his LAPD supervisors wanted 
everything done to ensure that the accused officers had the best legal defense 
possible. But department policy prohibits such activity and police supervisors 
say they never authorized Kavanaugh to assist the defense. 
</P>
<P>
But Kavanaugh said: "It's never been a secret. I got a clear sign from my 
supervisors that it was OK to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh said he is convinced the officers are innocent. "They're charged with 
conspiracy to commit vandalism," he said. "But no way are they guilty, even 
remotely guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The defense work by Kavanaugh, a 30-year officer who plans to retire soon, has 
triggered outrage from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shocking that they would do this," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher 
Darden, who is prosecuting the case and now plans to weigh whether it has been 
jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"It disturbs me that Kavanaugh or anybody else in the LAPD would in any way be 
assisting criminal defendants simply because they are police officers," he 
added. "I don't see why a police officer who is a criminal defendant should be 
given special consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Police Department officials, however, disputed Kavanaugh's contention that he 
was permitted to work as a criminal defense investigator. They said he first 
became involved in the case whenhe was asked to serve as a defense 
representative for several of the officers in administrative hearings. From 
there, he came in contact with defense attorneys and began sharing his 
information with them. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were only allowing him to review the criminal defense case 
so he could use it to defend other officers at the administrative hearings. But 
they emphasized that he was not to work for the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I never gave him approval to be a criminal defense investigator or anything 
like that," said Kavanaugh's direct supervisor, Lt. Ken Small. "But he was 
given specific direction that if he wanted to work with those four defense 
attorneys, he would have to do so as a 'defense rep.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman, said Kavanaugh was 
advised not to cross over the line and help the defense attorneys. He said the 
department would review Kavanaugh's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a little bit of a mystery there, as to what he's been attending 
to and in what capacity," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kavanaugh insisted that his superiors approved of his efforts to assist the 
accused officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Small knew what I was doing all along," the sergeant said. "I told him a 
number of times. He didn't object to it. He didn't tell me that I couldn't do 
it. I even put what I was doing in my logs, and I submitted those logs to him." 
</P>
<P>
By early August, Kavanaugh was working out of the law offices of Michael Stone, 
an attorney for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, who is representing 
one of the accused officers. 
</P>
<P>
In his work for the defense, Kavanaugh said he interviewed inmates in a state 
prison and the San Bernardino County Jail, obtaining information he said was 
"fruitful" for proving the officers are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
He said he tape-recorded interviews with about five neighbors near 39th and 
Dalton and other witnesses. "I turned the tapes over to the defense attorneys," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he conducted stakeouts in the neighborhood "on several occasions" 
in the hope of uncovering evidence of drug activity there, as part of a defense 
argument that police had reason to believe there was drug activity inside the 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
He reviewed records and other documents at police headquarters. "I was looking 
for records of people who may have been there that night that we didn't know 
about. I thought maybe I could interview them and get a different story." 
</P>
<P>
He said he also compared taped interviews with written statements made earlier 
by various witnesses, was present when three officers gave sworn testimony 
about the case, and turned his files over to the criminal defense team. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say I was probably able to provide them some insight into various 
facets of the case," Kavanaugh said. "And they were extremely appreciative of 
my help." 
</P>
<P>
Stone, the police union attorney, agreed that Kavanaugh is well-versed on the 
39th and Dalton case. "Bob Kavanaugh probably knows more about what happened 
there than any one person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the lawyer maintained that there was nothing improper about Kavanaugh 
providing him with any materials or information to help his client because it 
probably will be used later to help the other officers in the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh, nevertheless, said his role as member of the criminal defense team 
was obvious, and that it is a common practice among Los Angeles police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing happens all the time," he said. "It's something that's been 
accepted and done for a long time."

DAY LABORERS SAY EMPLOYER CHEATED THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty immigrant day laborers demanding back wages surrounded an employer's 
truck on a downtown Los Angeles street corner Wednesday morning, pounding on 
the doors and standing on the front bumper until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Amir Abdoul said he had gone to Main Street and 14th Place, as he often does, 
to hire one or two workers to move large rolls of carpeting and fabric for his 
company, Express Delivery Service. Instead, he was confronted first by Javier 
Felix, a 21-year-old Mexican immigrant, who said he had not been paid for a 
day's work he performed last month. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, half a dozen other laborers who said they had also worked for Abdoul 
approached the startled entrepreneur, along with others showing "solidarity" 
with their fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Abdoul denied having cheated the workers and no arrests were made. But the 
incident illustrates some of the tensions at the Main Street intersection, 
where more than 100 men gather every morning, hoping to earn about $5 an hour 
performing manual labor. 
</P>
<P>
Competition for jobs is tough. When pickups and other trucks approach the 
intersection, groups of men sometimes push and shove each other in a desperate 
bid to reach the prospective employer first. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find employment for several days, at least a dozen men currently 
sleep on the sidewalk along 14th Place. And even those able to find work say 
they are sometimes paid as little as $20 for a full day's hard labor. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Abdoul arrived at the intersection and was challenged by Felix, 
several of the immigrant men said they saw it as an opportunity to release 
their frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in his truck, we saw him and we didn't let him leave," Rigoberto Rocha 
said in Spanish as police officers questioned Abdoul and a handful of the 
workers. "All of the raza (Latino men) surrounded the truck. How are we going 
to let him get away with something like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Felix said he had been hired by Abdoul three weeks ago. After working eight 
hours lifting rugs at several sites downtown, he said he asked for the $40 
promised him by Abdoul. But the boss was nowhere to be found at the end of the 
day and Abdoul's other employees merely shrugged their shoulders when Felix 
asked for his pay. 
</P>
<P>
Abdoul acknowledged hiring Felix. But he added that the day laborer had worked 
only half a day and then quit because Abdoul denied him a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneur said he was surprised to see Felix again Wednesday, this time 
banging at the window of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
Abdoul said he would no longer be hiring men at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not coming here anymore. This is my last time" he said. "It's too crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Police officers separated the angry day laborers from Abdoul, suggesting that 
the workers go to the state labor commissioner's office on nearby Broadway to 
file a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get involved, we just keep the peace," said Sgt. Barry Staggs. "As 
far as we're concerned, it's a civil matter. It's for Judge (Joseph) Wapner (of 
television's 'The People's Court') to decide." 
</P>
<P>
As Abdoul started his truck and began to leave, a few day laborers waved at him 
from across Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you need any workers?" they shouted in Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
Abdoul ignored them and drove away.

workers, above, who compete for day jobs paying about $5 an hour. ANACLETO

<P>
LAW: THE STATE BAR'S FUND TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF UNETHICAL ATTORNEYS IS 
BUSIER THAN EVER. THE PROFESSION MAINTAINS IT TO IMPROVE AN UNDESIRABLE IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the State Bar of California wants to set the record straight. 
Shakespeare was not insulting the legal profession with the line, "The first 
thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers." The character who uttered those words 
in "Henry VI" was himself a criminal, see, so the Bard was really offering 
praise, Charles Vogel said. You could look it up. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the leader of the California bar is somewhat defensive about the fact 
that shys. . . , er, attorneys don't have the greatest image. Some people might 
describe 500 lawyers on the bottom of the ocean as "a good start," as the joke 
goes, but not Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason he presided over a press conference in Los Angeles on 
Wednesday at which the legal profession actually gave money to clients who were 
victimized by crooked lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Lesley-Anne Melloy, a Los Angeles resident who suffered whiplash in an auto 
accident, was handed a check for $3,333 to compensate for money she was denied 
when her lawyer forged her signature on a settlement check and deposited it in 
his own account. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Dean, an Altadena resident, picked up checks for $5,500 for herself and 
$2,738 for her 17-year-old daughter, Tara. They had been denied settlements 
from an auto accident. "Just a dishonest lawyer," Dean said of her troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Television cameras and newspaper photographers recorded the event for 
posterity. The poet John Keats ("I think we may class the lawyer in the natural 
history of monsters") would have been impressed. 
</P>
<P>
The checks are, in a sense, the profession's way of saying "we're sorry" for 
the unsavory among them. Annual bar association dues include $40 set aside for 
a so-called "Client Security Fund" to compensate for the lawyers' dishonest 
brethren. 
</P>
<P>
The obscure program covers instances of theft and embezzlement rather than 
malpractice. It started in 1972 with an annual $5 contribution per lawyer, and 
since then it has paid out more than $12 million to 2,288 clients. But it is 
busier now than ever. In 1989, it paid $2.3 million on 584 claims. So far this 
year, 443 checks totaling about $2 million have been distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the legal profession has become any sleazier, Vogel asserted. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that lawyers are any more dishonest than other people," he said. 
"There's a level of dishonesty that runs through the entire population." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he suggested, there are more crooked lawyers these days simply because 
there are more lawyers, especially in California. The state that is home to 
about one-ninth of the nation's residents has about one-sixth of its lawyers. 
It has more than 124,000 in all, of whom about 103,000 are in practice. 
</P>
<P>
More significant, Vogel said, has been the State Bar's effort to clean its own 
house. A series of reforms triggered by an award-winning San Francisco 
Chronicle expose in 1985 transformed the Client Security Fund from a low 
priority to a high priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
William O. Fleischman, a Los Angeles real estate attorney who serves on the 
commission that oversees the fund, emphasized that the program often has to 
reject "borderline" claims. The program distinguishes between attorneys who 
commit malpractice and those who simply take the money and run. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who ran off with the client's money -- well, he's a crook, and we're 
going to take care of that," Fleischman said.

The attorneys in these cases are disbarred through disciplinary action or by 
resignation. If they wish to regain their license to practice, they must 
reimburse the fund, Fleischman said. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol and drug abuse is a common problem among attorneys who defraud clients, 
Fleischman said. Melloy suggested that sympathy for her lawyer's drug abuse was 
one reason she did not press criminal charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said clients who believe they have lost money to dishonest lawyers could 
call 800-843-9053 to learn more about the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program does not offer much relief to victims of malpractice, 
individuals are advised of their legal options, Fleischman said.

"We tell them, 'Look, sue this guy,' " he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $700,000 IN DELINQUENT CHILD SUPPORT 
COLLECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than $700,000 in child support payments has been collected from 650 
delinquent parents in Los Angeles County District Atty. Ira Reiner's two-month 
amnesty program, Reiner said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference with his long-time adversary, feminist attorney Gloria 
Allred, Reiner said that additional child support payments have been pledged by 
parents who took advantage of the "Support Our Kids" program in order to avoid 
arrest and jail. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said his Bureau of Family Support operations plans to file more than 250 
new cases against parents who have failed to provide family support. His 
investigators also will resume arrests of those with outstanding warrants for 
failure to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested will face up to one year in jail, a $2,000 fine, or both, Reiner 
said. And they still will be responsible for the support payments, he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WORKER SUSPENDED OVER PERSONAL 
PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County Public Works Department foreman has been suspended for 30 
days for ordering workers to build boat racks, duck decoys and other items for 
his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
But the shop manager who filed the complaint says such abuses have gone on for 
15 years and extends far beyond the one shop that the county investigated. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stopped it here at this yard, but it goes on today all over this 
department," said Rudy Rico, manager of the department's Pasadena instrument 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman Larry Parrish was suspended after an audit showed at least 30 hours of 
county time had been used on projects for his personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
A recommendation to fire the foreman was rejected after county attorneys 
learned that other workers had gone unpunished for similar offenses, said 
county Chief Auditor J. Tyler McCauley. Parrish declined to comment except to 
say that he had been made a scapegoat.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES FILE SUIT OVER SEARCH 
OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies charged in a Los Angeles federal 
court suit filed Wednesday that investigators probing charges of money-skimming 
of drug funds had illegally searched their home. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights action, brought by Deputies J.C. Miller and Elizzie Mary 
Anderson, said that while deputies and federal agents had a warrant to conduct 
a search on Oct. 3, 1989, there was insufficient probable cause to indicate 
that Miller had done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was suspended with pay during the probe but has never been charged. The 
investigation has resulted in the indictment of 10 deputies. Anderson has not 
been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which names Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and several 
investigators, seeks unspecified damages for alleged civil rights violations, 
false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and emotional distress.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cecil Fielder became the first American Leaguer to hit 50 home runs since Roger 
Maris and Mickey Mantle did it 29 years ago, connecting Wednesday night in the 
fourth inning and later adding No. 51 in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of pressure," Fielder said. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit first baseman is the 11th player to hit 50 homers and the first 
since George Foster of the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. The feat has been 
accomplished 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who walked and lined out in his first two at-bats, sent a 2-and-1 
pitch from New York Yankee rookie Steve Adkins into the first row of the upper 
deck in left field in the fourth. He took four steps out of the batter's box, 
watched to see if the ball would hook foul, and when it didn't, he began 
jumping up and down and pumping both fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I got so excited, I jumped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer put Detroit ahead, 6-0. After striking out, increasing his 
major league-leading total to 182, Fielder hit a three-run homer in the eighth 
off Alan Mills into the lower deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder led the majors in homers and with 132 RBIs this season. He had gone two 
for 21 since his last home run; his longest drought of the year without a homer 
was 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went 0 for 4 in each of the first two games of the season-ending series 
at Yankee Stadium. He struck out five times, popped out twice and grounded to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson moved Fielder 
from the third spot in the lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Of the last five players to hit 50 home runs, four were named most valuable 
player. The only one who missed out was Mantle, who hit 54 homers to Maris' 
record 61 in 1961 in the home run race between Yankee teammates.

In college football, the East is the least. No Eastern team is in the Top 25 
for the first time since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Penn State and Boston College have a combined record of 
5-7-3. The Bottom Ten selectors, caught up in the realignment craze, have moved 
them into the Ivy League, whose eight teams failed to win a game Saturday. The 
new 12-team conference is ranked No. 1 this week. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bottom Ten Alumni Dept., one-time member Oregon's vicious Ducks crushed 
helpless Brigham Young and quarterback Ty Detmer, 32-16, prompting the NCAA to 
announce that there will be no Heisman Trophy awarded this year. 
</P>
<P>
Duck defensive back Daryle Smith said afterward: "Some people don't even know 
how to pronounce 'Oregon.' They do now."

KUDOS DEPT.: UCLA student Ann McLean, on the Bruins' inclusion in the Bottom

THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
New England (whose owner, Victor Kiam, also markets Lady Remington shavers) and 
Cincinnati were involved in controversies over mistreatment of female 
reporters. An enraged Houston aide struck a photographer with his foot at the 
Oiler-San Diego Charger game, prompting speculation that he might be the kicker 
San Diego was seeking. Thirty-one Raider fans were arrested on a variety of 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Was anything happening on the field Sunday? In the case of the Steelers, no. 
Pittsburgh's new, misdirected offense still has not scored a touchdown. 
Fortunately, for the Steelers, their magic number is 12 (games left in the 
season). 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix quarterback Timm Rosenbach, a former Washington State star, was a bit 
disoriented himself, attempting at one point to take the snap from a guard, 
rather than from the center. (The Washington Huskies' Mark Brunell made the 
same error earlier -- what is it with quarterbacks from that state?) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vikings added a new dimension to their offense by installing 
Anthony Carter as a punt returner. Of six kicks that came his way Sunday, 
Carter allowed one to bounce more than 20 yards past him and called fair 
catches on five others. The new dimension: Boredom.

HEAT DOES SOCCER SHUFFLE, WANTS TO STAY IN SOUTH BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appointment of veteran public relations expert Dick White as general 
manager of the Los Angeles Heat may signal that the American Professional 
Soccer League team will remain in the South Bay and not move to Orange County 
as previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
White, a former sports editor at the Torrance Daily Breeze who has held several 
professional sports management jobs over the past 25 years, was appointed 
Tuesday to replace Jill Fracisco, who was the only female executive in the 
APSL. Fracisco, 26, criticized by team owners for her leadership style, was 
quietly fired Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of El Camino College and a current board member of the school's 
fund-raising foundation, White opposes moving the team to Orange County for the 
1991 season, a decision announced in August by Club President John Ajemian. 
Ajemian's announcement has met with resistance from dissident South Bay owners 
and some league officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to Orange County," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian said in recent weeks it became clear that the Heat would have trouble 
finding a suitable stadium near Mission Viejo, his top choice. In addition, 
there is speculation that the San Diego Nomads, who did poorly at the gate 
after moving to Southwestern College in Chula Vista, are investigating a move 
into South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
White's appointment is seen as a compromise by Ajemian to several owners among 
the more than half a dozen who hold a stake in the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go to Orange County, but it is not entirely my decision," Ajemian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian, 31, and L.A. record company executive Lionel Conway are recognized by 
the APSL as holding 50% ownership of the club, although legal documents between 
owners have not been finalized yet. Ajemian said he and Conway have put more 
than $160,000 into the Heat, which has never turned a profit. The Heat's 1989 
budget was less than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian said that he expects White to do "a great job." 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I think he will do is to get us more recognition in the 
community," Ajemian said. "He's been here a while. He will open some eyes." 
</P>
<P>
A resident of San Pedro, White, 50, has held positions in public relations, 
marketing and management with the Los Angeles Blades hockey team, San Diego 
Sports Enterprises, which ran the San Diego Sports Arena and the defunct Gulls 
professional hockey team and Rockets professional basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked for California Sports Inc., when it operated the Forum, Kings 
and Lakers, the Los Angeles Aztecs, a defunct professional soccer team based at 
El Camino, the Coliseum Commission and the Hollywood Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
White would like to see the team play at El Camino's Murdock Stadium, but is 
also considering Veterans Stadium in Long Beach, where the Heat drew 3,500 for 
its first game of the APSL West championship series with the San Francisco Bay 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Stadium, owned by Long Beach City College, has a license to sell beer. 
El Camino does not allow the sale of alcohol. However, at either site, the 
concessions would be run by the host school, with the Heat drawing, perhaps, a 
small percentage of the total sales. 
</P>
<P>
White is anxious to negotiate for a home field. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we had a decision a week ago," he said. "It's my feeling that we are 
two months behind now in deciding where we are going to play." 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, (White) should have been hired two months ago," he said. "All 
of this should have been decided long ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat played its home opener at Murdock Stadium and the remaining nine 
regular-season home games at West Torrance High last summer, a field that was 
too narrow by soccer standards and offered few of the amenities that league 
officials want in a stadium. The team also failed to attract large crowds. The 
Heat's largest announced crowd was 1,124 for a game against Salt Lake City in 
mid-July. Next season the APSL West is expected to require members to attract a 
minimum of 2,500 spectators a game. In addition, the APSL championship game is 
scheduled to be played in the West, either San Jose or Los Angeles. The Heat 
would be designated the host team if the championship game is held here. 
</P>
<P>
The rent at West Torrance was low, however, compared to Murdock Stadium, which 
according to Ajemian, cost more than $9,000 for the one game. The cost at 
Veterans Stadium ran about $600, plus incidentals and management fees, which 
brought the one-game total to about $2,400. A multiyear pact might reduce those 
fees substantially, a source with the Heat said. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino officials have also offered to drop the rental fee to $3,000 per 
game, according to two sources. 
</P>
<P>
The club expects to maintain its offices on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo 
Beach, a building that is owned by Eugene Schiappa, a founder and part-owner of 
L.A. Heat Inc., which was founded in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
White has been working as private management consultant on a part-time basis 
since suffering a heart attack last year. He was reportedly approached by a 
Heat owner, Roland Martin, about two months ago about taking the job. 
</P>
<P>
He said he attended several games and read about the team in local papers. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I noticed this summer (at games) was that there was hardly any kid 
involvement (in the stands)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White said his major emphasis will be to improve the team's camp program, 
reaching out to youth soccer audiences with free coaching and skills camps 
utilizing Heat players. Bobby Bruch, a forward who also directed the Heat's 
community service program, is expected to be retained to help with the camps, 
but White is expected to hire another person to be the club's community 
liaison. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Smith, director of public relations, has been retained and White is also 
expected to hire a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year the Heat did a good job with the limited personnel, time and budget 
it had," White said. "I'm hoping to step up those things (a notch) this year." 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco, who said she was surprised by the firing, wished White well. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great feeling for that team," she said. "With the contacts (White) 
has, I think he will be good for that club." 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco said she might leave soccer altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what I'm going to do," she said.

<P>
THREE SURREALIST ARTISTS PROVIDE A PORTAL TO ANOTHER REALM 
</P>

Prepare to enter . . . the fourth dimension. Dee do dee do dee do dee. . . . 
Too bad newspapers don't have soundtracks. You'll have to imagine the mixture 
of mysticism, physics, psychology and social commitment surrounding "Pursuit of 
the Marvelous" without benefit of gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which opens Friday, investigates the work of three surrealist artists 
active in California during the 1940s: Englishmen Stanley William Hayter and 
Gordon Onslow Ford, and American Charles Howard, all of whom were active in 
surrealist circles in England at the outbreak of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco -- a temporary base for Howard, a summertime hangout for 
Hayter and an adopted home for Onslow Ford -- the three artists helped to 
invigorate an art scene that was in the process of throwing off its allegiance 
to realist painting and beginning a brief love affair with abstraction.

Hayter, who was born in 1901 to a family of artists, studied chemistry and 
geology before concentrating wholeheartedly on art. Printmaking was his passion 
and challenge. In Paris in the 1920s he founded a print workshop where he 
developed several innovative processes. He also became intrigued by the 
subconscious investigations of the surrealists. 
</P>
<P>
Fiercely intense in his commitment to a cause, whether it was communism or a 
new theory of art, he wanted, as he wrote, to merge "the unconscious element 
from which inspiration comes, and extremely rational control of the methods of 
execution." 
</P>
<P>
Using clashing, acid-toned colors (considered bizarre at the time), 
deliberately ambiguous superimposed images and webs of line as intricate as 
diagrams of the human nervous system, Hayter aimed to fuse the concepts of 
space and time, creating a sphere extending limitlessly into space that 
included both the work of art and the viewer. He expected viewers who entered 
the energized fabric of his prints to find themselves peering into their "own 
internal reality," as if whisked away by a new form of sci-fi time travel. 
</P>
<P>
Howard was born in 1899 in New Jersey to a family of artists who resettled in 
Berkeley when he was an infant. In his early 30s he married British painter 
Madge Knight and moved to England, where he stayed until 1940 and would return 
after the war. 
</P>
<P>
A buddy of mobile artist Alexander Calder, Howard was also intrigued by making 
abstract forms move in space; a critic once called his work "dynamic 
architecture." But his mature paintings, begun during his years in London, deal 
primarily with the struggle to find formal clarity in the midst of chaos. His 
abstract forms, suggestive of biological and organic imagery, are encroached 
upon by vast expanses of darkness, reflecting the gulf between dreams of a new 
social order and the reality of fearsome totalitarian power. 
</P>
<P>
Ford left England for the artist's life in Paris in 1936, when he was in his 
early 20s, and became a member of the official surrealist group. Under his and 
Chilean artist Matta's influence, the new wave of surrealists rejected the type 
of figurative "dream" imagery associated with Salvador Dali's work in favor of 
abstract explorations of the cosmic unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's paintings contained all manner of circles, whorls, floating planes, 
lines of force, disembodied shadows and blobby forms -- each floating freely 
through space and laying bare, as he claimed, "the secrets contained in the 
universe of the human mind." 
</P>
<P>
Quicker access to those secrets occured when the subconscious took over -- when 
paint was poured freely on the canvas and the patterns could be scrutinized, 
like tea leaves, for their special portents and meanings. 
</P>
<P>
When the war started, surrealism ended as an official movement. But Ford, who 
is still painting, went on to experiment with rhythmic patterns of dots -- like 
atomic particles -- that aerated the canvas in a visionary way. Art was to be a 
way of meditation, a portal leading from ordinary life to the realm of the 
marvelous.

UCI SCIENTISTS CALL METHANE LEAKS MASSIVE IN E. EUROPE;

ENVIRONMENT: THEY SAY DILAPIDATED NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS ARE TO BLAME FOR THE 
POLLUTION, WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING.

Methane, a major chemical linked to global warming, is leaking in massive 
amounts in several Eastern European cities, much of it thought to be from 
antiquated natural gas systems, according to researchers from UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Since methane accounts for up to 25% of the gases causing the so-called 
greenhouse effect, plugging leaky pipes in Eastern bloc nations could make an 
important dent in efforts to forestall global warming, the UCI scientists 
reported today in the scientific journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
"Methane is different," said research team director F. Sherwood Rowland, the 
UCI chemist who discovered in the mid-1970s that the Earth's protective ozone 
layer is being destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons, another variety of chemicals 
also implicated in global warming. "Because its lifetime is about 10 years, if 
we take away just 10% of (the world's methane) emissions, we can get methane in 
the atmosphere back in balance." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe would not account for all of that 10%, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not pointing a finger at any of the Eastern European cities," said 
atmospheric chemist Donald R. Blake, a member of Rowland's research team. 
"We're saying that here's an area, (given) the short lifetime of methane, where 
we could be seeing some results." Efforts to reduce methane in the rest of the 
industrialized world must also continue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI data corresponds with previous findings of European scientists, said 
Kathleen Hogan, chief of the methane program for the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's global resource division. Those scientists have estimated 
that as much as 10% of the natural gas supplies piped through the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe are leaking into the atmosphere, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The high levels of methane were measured in air samples taken last May in the 
cities of Budapest, Hungary; Krakow, Poland; Prague, Czechoslovakia; and 
Berlin. Similar tests found far lower levels of methane gas -- levels 
comparable to most U.S. cities -- in the more modern cities of Vienna and 
Zagreb, Yugoslavia, Rowland, Blake and Neil Harris reported in the 
correspondence published in Nature. 
</P>
<P>
Sampling in the Yerevan region of Soviet Armenia last January also turned up 
high emissions of methane, but because it is not an urban area, Rowland said 
they are uncertain of the source. Further studies throughout Eastern Europe are 
warranted, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of industrialization, is the chief gas responsible 
for the greenhouse effect, caused by a buildup of gases in the Earth's 
atmosphere that traps heat. Scientists believe an increase of only several 
degrees in the Earth's average temperature could result in rapid and dramatic 
changes in global weather patterns, rising ocean levels and possibly the 
extinction of many plant and animal species. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide represents about half of the greenhouse gases, with methane and 
chlorofluorocarbons making up the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
Methane is an odorless, flammable gas that is a chief component in the natural 
gas commonly used for household heating and cooking. It also is formed by 
decomposing vegetation and found in coal deposits. The bulk of the 550 megatons 
of methane spewed into the atmosphere each year is thought to come from such 
rural sources as swamps, marshes, tundra, coal mines, rice paddies, landfills 
and flatulent cows. 
</P>
<P>
However, urban areas are increasingly being viewed as the easiest, quickest way 
to reduce methane concentrations. Because the Earth's atmosphere has the 
ability to cleanse about 500 megatons of methane per year, a 10% worldwide 
decrease in methane emissions would virtually eliminate the gas as part of the 
global warming problem, Rowland said. 
</P>
<P>
Global warming experts called the UCI findings "very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
"The sources of methane are not well understood," said Michael Oppenheimer, an 
atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Defense Fund and author of the 
book, "Dead Heat: The Race Against The Greenhouse Effect," which was published 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
But Oppenheimer said the Rowland group's data "indicates that high levels of 
methane are being released in the (Eastern European) cities." 
</P>
<P>
Reducing those releases by repairing leaky gas distribution systems, if indeed 
that is the source of the urban methane, "would be a cost-effective way to cut 
down on the growth of atmospheric gases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are economic reasons, too, for Eastern European countries to consider 
repairing the pipelines that deliver most of their natural gas from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan said that beginning Jan. 1, the Soviet Union will require hard cash in 
exchange for natural gas sold at market rates. That will be a heavy incentive 
to reduce waste through leaky systems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNNATURAL GAS LEAKS -- Here are methane levels measured in each city in parts 
per million by volume (ppmv). Methane concentrations found in the cities are 
believed to emanate from man made sources. For comparison, methane levels 
outside these cities averaged about 1.80 ppmv.

ANAHEIM GERMAN CLUB TOASTS REUNIFICATION OF HOMELAND

Edda Hampel remembers when East Berlin soldiers erected the wall that divided 
the city in 1961, when she was a young Berliner. Some nights, she would hear 
shouting, see searchlights followed by gunfire and know someone else had been 
killed trying to cross into West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget that," said Hampel, who emigrated to the United States 
three years ago and now lives in La Habra with her Berlin-born husband, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Those memories make Wednesday's unification of East and West Germany into one 
democratic nation all the more surprising and joyous, Edda Hampel said while 
celebrating the unification at the Phoenix Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Club, which founders say is the largest German club in the United 
States, marked the occasion with champagne, bratwurst, Polish sausage, choruses 
of the German and American nation anthems and news footage of November's 
crumbling of the Berlin wall. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people, most of German descent, sang and danced beneath a banner 
proclaiming: "Vereinigtes Deutschland," United Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always told my children that reunification would not take place in my 
lifetime -- short of a war," said Jack Hampel, 58, an auto-body shop manager 
who took off from work to celebrate at the club. "The amazing thing is, it did 
take place." 
</P>
<P>
Hampel, who has lived in the United States for 35 years, said unification will 
not be easy for Germans, who have lived as two nations since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be very difficult to get these two countries with two cultures and two 
economies to get together," he said. "Everything in life has a prices. Yes, 
taxes will be raised but people have to look at the rewards." 
</P>
<P>
When the Berlin wall went up, Jurgen Maerz, 42, was a Boy Scout staying at a 
Berlin youth hostel. "I saw them build that awful thing," Maerz said. 
</P>
<P>
He still remembers the people crying, the nighttime gunfire and wondering 
whether they would be allowed to cross the East German border to return to his 
home in West Germany. If you can comprehend those feelings of a country 
divided, he said, you will understand how Germans feel to be united again. 
</P>
<P>
Although some are calling Wednesday a "reunification" of the Germanys, Maerz 
said, he stresses that it's a unification. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no re anything," he said. We don't want to put back anything. We don't 
want to put back Hitler and we don't want to put the Kaiser back from before," 
Maerz said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's celebration at the Phoenix Club initially was meant to be a low-key 
luncheon for members but grew after people kept telephoning to ask what was 
being planned to commemorate the event, club president Hans Klein said. 
</P>

Chemotherapy undergone before radiation treatment doubled the survival rate of 
a group of patients with the most common type of inoperable lung cancer, 
according to a national study released today in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Of the patients who underwent only radiation therapy, 11% survived three years 
after treatment, contrasted with 23% who underwent five weeks of chemotherapy 
followed by six weeks of daily radiation therapy, according to the lead author 
of the study, Dr. Robert O. Dillman, medical director of the Hoag Cancer Center 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that just by adding that little bit of chemotherapy, there 
was a doubling in the survival rate," Dillman said. "The bad news is that still 
didn't help about 75% of the patients." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Glaspy, director of UCLA's joint oncology clinic, said the study 
proves there are benefits to chemotherapy. But he noted that even the improved 
survival rates in the study were not good. 
</P>
<P>
"The big point to the reader is, you'd better quit smoking -- quick," Glaspy 
said. "Because these big breakthroughs are changing survival rates by four 
months (on average), and that ain't much." 
</P>
<P>
The three-year study began in 1984 and examined 155 patients with inoperable 
non-small-cell lung cancer, which affects as many as 40,000 Americans, Dillman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and conducted by a 
cooperative group of oncologists from Hoag, Massachusetts General Hospital in 
Boston, Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, UC San Diego Medical Center, McGill 
University in Montreal and the University of Missouri in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Patients with this kind of inoperable cancer were given a five-week course of 
chemotherapy -- two doses of the drug cisplatin and five doses of vinblastine. 
The duration was short enough so that patients were able to tolerate the side 
effects of the chemotherapy and still benefit from radiation treatment, Dillman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by six weeks of daily treatments of high-dose radiation 
therapy, concentrated on the chest area where the cancer was visible, Dillman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Major tumor shrinkage was seen in 44% of the patients who got both chemotherapy 
and radiation, contrasted with 35% in patients who received only radiation, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
After one year of treatment, 55% of those who underwent chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy survived, contrasted with 40% among the radiation-only group. 
Three years after treatment, 23% of the chemotherapy-radiation group had 
survived, contrasted with 11% for the radiation-only group. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year study was followed by three more years of tracking the patients 
and analyzing the data, Dillman said. At last count, three of the chemotherapy- 
radiation patients were still alive more than four years after treatment. Two 
were from Massachusetts General Hospital and one from McGill University. 
</P>
<P>
A confirming study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute is under way 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Dillman said the key finding is that chemotherapy, especially in earlier 
stages, is more effective in lung cancer than many doctors realize. 
</P>
<P>
"Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed by family practitioners or 
general internists, and they often have their initial care and treatment 
decisions made by those physicians," Dillman said. "We know now that if we wait 
until (final stages of lung cancer) then chemotherapy is really too late. 
Patients will have severe side effects, won't tolerate the therapy, and it 
won't help."

EL TORO, LAGUNA HILLS TO VOTE ON CITYHOOD;

<P>
INCORPORATION: LAFCO OVERRIDES RECOMMENDATIONS OF DENIAL THAT CITED COUNTY

<P>
The fast-growing areas of south Orange County took another step toward 
urbanization and self-rule Wednesday when the Local Agency Formation Commission 
cleared the way for El Toro and Laguna Hills to become the county's newest 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Santa Ana, the LAFCO board voted 4 to 0 with one abstention to let 
the voters decide if El Toro and Laguna Hills should become the latest South 
County areas to create their own city councils to deal with local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
If approved in the March 30 vote, the neighboring areas straddling Interstate 5 
would become the 30th and 31st cities in the county, joining Laguna Niguel, 
Dana Point and Mission Viejo as areas that have opted for cityhood in the past 
three years. The first day of business for the new cities would be Dec. 20, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The LAFCO board gave its approval despite strong recommendations from the 
agency's staff, the county's chief administrative officer and the Environmental 
Management Agency that the applications be denied on the grounds that loss of 
tax revenue to the county would hurt its already shrinking coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers in Laguna Hills and El Toro welcomed LAFCO's approval and 
exchanged hugs after the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it, this is wonderful," said Grady Davis, secretary of El Toro's 
Community Coalition for Incorporation. "Standing out in the street to solicit 
petitions was worth it after all." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber also erupted in applause when the board voted to approve an amended 
version of the Laguna hills application. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new city of El Toro would have a population of 58,000. It would be 
bounded on the north by the planned Foothill Transportation Corridor, on the 
east by Mission Viejo, on the west by Irvine and on the south by Interstate 5. 
It would not include El Toro Marine Corps Air Station or the proposed Foothill 
Ranch development lying north of the Foothill corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills, with a population estimated at 23,000, would be bounded by El 
Toro Road on the north, Interstate 5 to the east, Crown Valley Parkway to the 
south and Moulton Parkway to the west. 
</P>
<P>
The twin cityhood efforts have taken a long and tortured path as municipal 
fever has swept much of the South County, dictated by what homeowners see as 
their natural allegiances to specific areas and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to Mission Viejo, a self-contained planned community, El Toro and 
Laguna Hills are not so well defined, and the fight to incorporate those areas 
has been fraught with controversy. Residents of the Portola Hills development 
near Trabuco Canyon, for example, were split about being tied in with the 
proposed city of El Toro, while in Laguna Hills, the large Leisure World 
retirement community successfully fought to keep itself from being included in 
the boundaries of that proposed municipality. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood proponents in both areas eventually compromised, deleting 
neighborhoods that wanted nothing to do with the new cities, and predicted 
Wednesday that voters would approve the new cities next March. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the potential loss of revenue for the county led Don R. Roth, 
chairman of the Board of Supervisors and a LAFCO board member, to abstain from 
Wednesday's vote. Before leaving the hearing, Roth urged other LAFCO 
commissioners to delay allowing a vote on the proposed incorporations. 
</P>
<P>
Noting recent budget cuts that would affect social services provided by the 
county, Roth said: "Now is not the time for new incorporations. . . . My 
countywide responsibilities to the poor and those in need make me see that now 
is not the time. We must set our priorities." 
</P>
<P>
If the two cities are incorporated, the county would lose $9.3 million annually 
in tax revenue, according to estimates by LAFCO's staff. 
</P>
<P>
But that figure could be lower since LAFCO trimmed significant 
revenue-generating areas from the boundaries of the proposed cities. Last week 
Gaddi H. Vasquez, a supervisor who serves as LAFCO chairman, struck a 
compromise by getting cityhood proponents to remove Portola Hills and the 
proposed Foothill Ranch development from their application. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the LAFCO board voted to keep the Laguna Hills Mall within the 
boundaries of the proposed city, but deleted the lucrative northern Laguna 
Hills area of homes and businesses from the proposed city limits. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, however, the deleted areas were placed in the proposed city's 
"sphere of influence," meaning they could be annexed after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone did not get everything," Vasquez said. "But by approving the 
petitions, we have moved the issues forward for the people to determine their 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Still, cityhood proponents were pleased with the outcome and were anxious to 
begin their campaigns to get the referendums approved. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first step is to incorporate the south and then it's on to annex the 
north," said Helen Wilson, co-chair of the Citizens to Save Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although El Toro residents were virtually certain about securing approval from 
the LAFCO board, cityhood backers in Laguna Hills were a little skeptical about 
their chances. However, their application received a major boost when 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes Laguna Hills, made a 
surprise appearance to testify in favor of the application. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the strong outpouring of community interest, I felt it was my 
responsibility to be here today to make your job easier," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills cityhood backers made two earlier, unsuccessful attempts to 
incorporate. First a proposal to create a city out of a large part of 
Saddleback Valley was defeated in November, 1988 -- it would have included both 
Laguna Hills and El Toro. Then, a cityhood proposal that included Leisure World 
was rejected by voters in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO's approval of both applications was seen by many cityhood backers as a 
reversal of what they called an unwritten agency policy to stem independence 
fever in South County communities.

PUSHCART VENDOR ORDINANCE PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pushcart and sidewalk vendors in the city would be required to carry permits, 
register with the police chief and wear uniforms under a 22-page proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would also ban the selling of food, beverages or any product from 
a box, stand or bag. 
</P>
<P>
But some council members said they feared that portion of the ordinance would 
mean that vendors like those who sell Fuller brushes would not be permitted to 
work in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we may have overdone it a little on the paper trail," said 
Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Genis said, the ordinance could discourage people who peddle unhealthful 
food in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was presented to the City Council on Monday; a vote is expected 
at its next meeting Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was first raised last month when Councilman Orville Amburgey proposed 
an outright ban on pushcarts in the city. Although the majority didn't support 
that measure, the city attorney was asked to look into restrictions on the 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Council members cited residents' complaints about traffic hazards and questions 
about the food being sold. 
</P>
<P>
The vendors, mostly Latino men who walk the streets pushing carts full of ice 
cream and snow cones, would be required to display city permits on their carts. 
The ordinance would also require them to wear a logo or insignia to identify 
their business. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is modeled after a similar measure in Santa Ana. The cities of 
Anaheim, Newport Beach and Brea also restrict the vendors. 
</P>
<P>
But Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, 
questioned the council's action in view of similar requirements that already 
exist: The vendors must obtain a city business permit and a county health 
permit before operating in the city. MARY ANNE PEREZ

LAW TO TAP BUILDERS FOR PARKS IS REBUILT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim's parks are about to receive a boost under a new ordinance that 
restores the city's power to require developers to set aside land or money for 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
The parkland requirement had been in place for years. 
</P>
<P>
However, a 1988 revision of the park ordinance inadvertently removed the city's 
ability to enforce the parkland provision. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unveiled the revised ordinance this week and it is likely to 
be approved next week. 
</P>
<P>
The law says that developers of residential projects must dedicate a portion of 
the land for park space, or be charged a fee. All developers of projects having 
50 or more units must also provide the city with funding to build the park. 
</P>
<P>
These requirements must be met before the developer can be granted a building 
permit. Specific acreage and funding amounts are determined according to the 
size of the project. LISA MASCARO

COUNCIL EASES LAW ON LIVING IN VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ordinance prohibiting people from living in vehicles parked on public rights 
of way has been revised to allow for such habitation in hardship cases. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members voted unanimously to allow for living in vehicles if there 
are "extenuating circumstances" that may force some people to live in trailers, 
cars and motor homes. 
</P>
<P>
The revision states that exceptions will be made "for a limited amount of time 
upon written request." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Carol Downey said the council became concerned after reading 
a story in August of a 41-year-old cancer patient who was told she could no 
longer live in a recreational vehicle parked in her neighbor's driveway in San 
Juan Capistrano. City officials there later gave the woman a permit allowing 
her to live in the RV for another three months. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to create a hardship for anyone," Downey said. "It was just 
made flexible enough so we could consider a case like that in San Juan 
Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the City Council voted to extend the prohibition to include 
commercial and industrial rights of way. The original ordinance, passed in 
1988, banned habitation in vehicles only in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Rosenthal, Placentia's director of development services, said city 
officials requested the code change after discovering someone had been living 
in his vehicle in an industrial area of the city for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Similar ordinances have been passed in other cities, including Garden Grove and 
Laguna Beach.TED JOHNSON

FIRM TO PAY $20,622 OVER WASTE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Environmental Management Corp., a company that transports hazardous 
waste, agreed to pay $20,622 to settle charges that it violated health and 
safety laws, the district attorney's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by county prosecutors alleged that the firm, at 11292 Western Ave., 
stored several containers of infectious waste longer than 96 hours, the limit 
under California law. 
</P>
<P>
The containers were to be shipped to a treatment facility for disposal. The 
alleged violations were found during a routine county health inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The company admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to pay a $20,000 civil fine and 
county costs of $622, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael J. Pear said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL MEMBERS DOUBLE OWN PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Beach council members voted unanimously this week to double their 
monthly paychecks from $150 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, was proposed by Councilman Dan 
Kenney, who is not seeking reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time the City Council got a raise was in 1965. I figured it was 
probably not so bad if I brought it forward," Kenney said Tuesday before the 
council's vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just an indication of the amount of work we put in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After taxes and other payroll deductions, Kenney said, council members 
currently take home $69.23 every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The state Government Code states that in cities with a population of less than 
35,000, councils can approve salaries up to $300 per month. Subsequent pay 
hikes may not exceed 5% each year. 
</P>
<P>
All Orange County cities except one in that population category already pay 
their council members at least $300 per month. The exception is Villa Park, 
population 6,950, which does not pay its council members.

SCHULLER TO PRODUCE SOVIET TV PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A representative from the Soviet Union Wednesday finalized a deal with the 
Crystal Cathedral's Robert Schuller to produce inspirational prime-time 
television messages for Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The formal contract establishes a new nonprofit joint entity called Spirit to 
Spirit and Heart to Heart, a church spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Its objectives are to produce one 30-minute television program once a month 
during the next 12 months and to publish and distribute Schuller's book "The Be 
Happy Attitudes" in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The contract solidifies plans made earlier this year when Schuller appeared on 
Soviet television, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract specifies that Schuller's messages are to be designed to "generate 
hope and dignity, moral support, universal values and truth and build on family 
and religious traditions." 
</P>
<P>
It also directs Schuller to provide "proof of God's provenance" and "build an 
edifice for the Church in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller is to speak for 20 minutes. Ten minutes are reserved for classical 
music "hopefully by Russian composers." 
</P>
<P>
The programs, taped here in English, will be aired with subtitles on prime time 
on the Soviet Channel 1 and possibly other channels. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet branch of the new association will publish and distribute Schuller's 
book, which has already been translated into Russian. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by Svyatoslav Rybas, director of Gosteleradio's 
department of literature and arts, who had accompanied a film crew that spent a 
week filming a documentary on Schuller at Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
The documentary will be used to introduce the regular inspirational television 
programs, a church spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The film crew is due to leave today for Washington, where it will interview 
"prominent Americans" before returning home Oct. 11.LYNN SMITH

County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder and Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. 
Neugebauer clashed repeatedly Wednesday in the first face-to-face encounter of 
their campaign for Wieder's 2nd Supervisorial District seat. 
</P>
<P>
In the debate, taped at the studios of KOCE-TV, Neugebauer wasted no time 
attacking Wieder, a board member since 1978, using her introductory statement 
to blast the incumbent for missing 23 board meetings in the last 21 months and 
abstaining on 69 votes over that period. 
</P>
<P>
"In 18 years of City Council service, I have missed three meetings," Neugebauer 
said. "I have never abstained because of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder responded by saying that Neugebauer's attack represented a lack of 
knowledge and information and that many of her absences were due to her 
attending to other important county business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not where you are, but what you're doing. The bottom line is what you 
contribute," Wieder said. "Mudslinging doesn't get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer also attacked Wieder for a vote she cast last year to declare a 
state of emergency in the county in accordance with the state's malathion 
spraying program for the Mediterranean fruit fly. In subsequent votes, Wieder 
voted against the emergency declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get our facts straight," Wieder said. "Of the five members of the board, 
there were two of us who did not vote for allowing" the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
When she was not rebutting criticism from Neugebauer, Wieder used her time to 
remind voters of what she sees as the highlights of her 12 years on the Board 
of Supervisors: bringing together warring sides to preserve the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands; creating a network of "super streets," including Beach Boulevard, a 
major artery in the 2nd District; formulating a plan to increase access to 
health care for the county's poor; and trying to improve the county's air 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
When Neugebauer was asked why voters should choose her over Wieder, she 
answered: "My strongest asset is that I am not an expert on anything. Every 
issue that comes before me deserves every inch of my attention span." 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates said they oppose Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax 
for transportation improvements, although for different reasons. Neugebauer 
said she objects to the measure's 20-year plan, particularly its provision to 
expand the use of car-pool lanes. Wieder said she thinks the measure is good 
but "cannot vote for it" because county voters have shown repeatedly that they 
oppose tax increases for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer called, instead, for increased funding for new freeways but did not 
clearly specify where the new money would come from. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder used her opponent's omission to her advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no magic wand, no bank to be robbed, no largess to find from 
someplace," Wieder said. "Building more freeways is something the populace of 
Orange County does not want." 
</P>
<P>
The candidates also differed on where a new county jail should be built, with 
Wieder favoring the current plan to place it in Gypsum Canyon and Neugebauer 
opting for Rancho del Rio, a ranch seized by narcotics agents in remote South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer never raised the issue of Wieder's false claim until two years ago 
of a college degree, an issue that cost her dearly in her unsuccessful 1988 bid 
for Congress. After the debate, Neugebauer said the issue just "never came up," 
although she does intend to use it in her mail campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's debate airs Oct. 25 at 6:30 p.m. on Channel 50. The candidates go 
at it again today at 12:30 p.m. in a live debate in the Golden West College 
Student Center.

</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TITAN LINEMAN, WHO SUFFERED A SPINAL INJURY IN 1988, SAYS 
JOYS OF THE SPORT OUTWEIGH THE RISK OF PARALYSIS.

<P>
His physique might resemble Disneyland's Matterhorn, but Mike Simmons, Cal 
State Fullerton's 6-foot-7, 320-pound lineman, would not compare his life to a 
roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been more like a jump across a canyon," says Simmons, who transferred 
from Arizona State to Fullerton two weeks before the season and is now the 
Titans' starting offensive tackle. "When I'm going straight, everything feels 
good. But when I go down, I go down hard." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons fell hard and deep in the spring of 1988 when he suffered what appeared 
to be a career-ending spinal cord injury. Doctors advised Simmons, who was used 
frequently as a reserve at Arizona State as a redshirt freshman in 1987, not to 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons sat out the next two football seasons, pleading with doctors to give 
him medical clearance and trying to adjust to having so much free time; he got 
into trouble and even was arrested once. Never again did he wear a Sun Devil 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with the battle, Simmons picked up a college directory last August and 
started dialing football coaches around the West and Southwest. The phone rang 
in Cal State Fullerton's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like fate," said Simmons, who had only one season of eligibility 
remaining when he transferred. "They were in a meeting talking about how they 
needed offensive linemen when I called. They said, 'When can you get here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, whose nickname is "Big City," arrived in mid-August and was tested by 
Fullerton trainers, an orthopedic surgeon and a neurosurgeon. Simmons didn't 
receive final medical clearance until after the season opener, but he has 
played in three of the past four Titan games. He missed one because of an ankle 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
For Simmons, an All-American at Tulsa (Okla.) McLain High School in 1985, the 
joys of playing football outweigh the dangers of playing. 
</P>
<P>
"If something (serious) were to happen to me, as long as I didn't die, I think 
my life would be just as meaningful," Simmons said. "I'm a child development 
major and you can do just as much for children from a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
But is it worth that risk? 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing happens and I make the pros, it was definitely worth it," Simmons 
said. "And if I don't make the pros, at least I still came back and did 
something I felt I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons wasn't sure what he'd be able to do after his injury. At the time, 
moving a limb or two took precedent over making the pros. 
</P>
<P>
During a contact blocking drill, Simmons found himself amid a pile of players. 
He isn't sure if it was a knee or a helmet, but something hit Simmons hard in 
the back and his body went numb. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else got up from the pile. Simmons remained on the ground, face down, 
motionless. 
</P>
<P>
During a three-day hospital stay, part of it in an intensive care unit, doctors 
diagnosed the injury as spinal shock. Simmons' spinal cord had been jarred, 
leaving him temporarily paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays didn't indicate any dislocations or fractures in his back or neck, and 
Simmons regained full movement within three days. 
</P>
<P>
Although extensive testing did not reveal neurological damage, Phoenix 
neurosurgeon Hal Pittman and ASU team physicians Norman Fee and Richard Lee 
concluded in August, 1988, that the risk of permanent paralysis was too great 
to allow Simmons to return. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody in their right mind would let him play," ASU Coach Larry 
Marmie told the Phoenix Gazette at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But when Simmons arrived at Fullerton, Titan trainer Jerry Lloyd felt the 
bigger question was why would they not let him play? Fullerton team physician 
Joseph Cummings gave Simmons medical clearance after consulting with 
neurologist Don DeFeo. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt he had a slight chance of injury, but only a little more than any 
other player," Lloyd said. "They thought it was within safe enough limits for 
Mike to return to competition." 
</P>
<P>
All players must sign a statement saying they understand the risks of 
participating in football, and that playing can result in serious injury or 
death, but Lloyd made Simmons sign an additional statement saying he also 
risked paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
"At ASU I was ready to sign a waiver relieving them and the doctors of all 
liability -- I even talked to a lawyer -- but they wouldn't take it," Simmons 
said. "That wasn't good enough for them." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons says his back has caused him only minor discomfort. A bigger problem 
has been getting into playing shape, re-learning the techniques that made him 
one of the nation's top high school linemen in 1985 and learning a new 
offensive system. 
</P>
<P>
"I found I had forgotten a lot of things, so coming back was like teaching a 
baby to walk," Simmons said. "I'm still behind. I'm nowhere near where I'd like 
to be, but I'm getting better each game." 
</P>
<P>
Better but not bigger. Simmons reported to camp at 330 pounds but has trimmed 
to 320. 
</P>
<P>
"He might be the biggest human being we've had here, but he's too big," Titan 
Coach Gene Murphy said. "He could be more effective if he was a little smaller, 
but it was a wham-bam-get-ready-to-play situation. He didn't have time to get 
into great shape." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons believes there's still time to improve and impress some professional 
scouts this season. But even if he isn't drafted or doesn't receive any NFL 
tryout invitations, he'll still consider this year worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Playing football has at least kept him occupied. That wasn't the case at 
Arizona State, where he began frequenting nightclubs and seemed to attract 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons hit a low in March, 1989, when he was arrested by ASU police and 
charged with felony theft. Police alleged that Simmons stole a 10mm handgun 
from the room of a student in a school residence hall. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons declined to discuss the incident, but said he pleaded guilty to the 
charge and received two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I did something and I had to pay for it," Simmons said. "I'm not ashamed of 
it. Like I said, when I go down, I really go down." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he appears on his way up. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our people talked to people at Arizona State, and they said he was a 
bad act," Murphy said. "But he's been anything but that here."

<P>
Former Cal State Fullerton standouts Mike Pringle and Reggie Redding are a step 
closer to making their NFL debuts after the Atlanta Falcons shifted them from 
injured reserve Wednesday to the new practice squad roster. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle and Redding were placed on injured reserve Sept. 5, barring them from 
playing or practicing for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, a running back and sixth-round draft choice, injured his ribs before 
the Falcons' first exhibition game, but played in all four primarily as a 
kickoff returner. 
</P>
<P>
Redding, an offensive tackle and fifth-round selection, sustained a neck injury 
in Atlanta's Aug. 25 exhibition game against the Green Bay Packers. STEVEN

HITTING THE WALL; 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN FOSTER OF OJAI PEDALED HIS WAY OVER THE 1,500-MILE MONUMENT TO CHINA'S 
ISOLATIONBUT TWICE WAS HOSPITALIZED DURING HIS 52-DAY ODYSSEY -- FOR EXHAUSTION 
AND INJURIES SUFFERED IN A FALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Foster was 12 when he caught his first glimpse of the Great Wall, an 
ancient fortification snaking 1,500 miles across China. In 1972, he and his 
sixth-grade classmates had to watch TV coverage of President Nixon's historic 
visit to China. Pretty dull homework -- until the wall flashed on the screen. 
To Foster, it looked like the longest bike path he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he told his classmates, "I'd love to ride my bike on the wall." 
They laughed, but Foster was serious -- it just would take him an additional 18 
years to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago Foster, a 30-year-old Ojai resident, became the first 
foreigner -- and probably the first person -- to ride a bike from one end of 
the Great Wall to the other. It was an epic undertaking. Aside from braving 
130-degree heat, hailstorms, sandstorms, flash floods and the treacherous wall 
itself, Foster had to get permission from the Chinese government, no easy feat 
of bureaucratic maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a guy as tenacious -- every obstacle was thrown in his way and 
he overcame all of them," said Charles O. Hyman, National Geographic Society 
book division director who was instrumental in helping Foster get into China. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, a professional actor, was doing Shakespeare in summer stock a few years 
ago when he came across the National Geographic's 1982 book "Journey Into 
China." Hyman had been director of the book project, and Foster was not shy -- 
he had been calling the organization's 800 number since his preteen days -- so 
he phoned Hyman, who put him in touch with China's version of the National 
Geographic Society, the Institute of Geography. 
</P>
<P>
Foster also enlisted a U. S. senator from his home state of Connecticut, 
Democrat Christopher J. Dodd, to help cut through the red tape. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Foster thought he had permission to make the trip in the summer 
of '89, but the student protests and the June 4 massacre outside Tian An Men 
Square closed China to the West. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting an additional 10 months, Foster, who trained for the odyssey by 
riding along Ojai mountain ridges, flew to China on April 27 on China Airlines, 
which he talked into contributing $25,000 in transportation costs. On May 9, 
wearing a long ponytail and razor-trimmed Fu Manchu, he rolled south out of 
Jiayuguan, a Gobi Desert city once visited by Marco Polo. 
</P>
<P>
Followed by a five-man support team, including two members of the Institute of 
Geography, Foster rode for a total 1,174.8 miles, toasting his achievement with 
a bottle of champagne on June 29 in Shanhaiguan, a city on the Yellow Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Foster was allowed to travel all but a few hundred miles of the Great Wall, 
which is not as great as it used to be. Begun more than 2,300 years ago by 
Imperial China, the wall was testimony to China's vast resources as well as its 
desire to isolate itself from the world. Over the centuries, the wall has been 
plundered for its bricks and made obsolete by modern warfare. Today, much of it 
is in disrepair, but it is still the only man-made structure that astronauts 
can see from space. 
</P>
<P>
After the first 1,000 miles of his journey, Foster and his colleagues had to 
board a train in Fugu -- he was not permitted to cycle through sensitive 
military installations in the Gobi -- and picked up the Great Wall again in 
Beijing. The last leg was only about 170 miles of actual riding but, Foster 
says, he had to carry his 25-pound bike an additional 300 miles to traverse 
gaps in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's most harrowing experience occurred 200 kilometers outside Beijing in a 
mountainous region called "Nine Dragon-Gate Pass." While parts of the wall -- 
the parts the tourists see -- are wide enough for a car, others are either 
frightfully narrow or so overgrown with bushes that Foster had to hack his way 
through with a machete. In Nine Dragon-Gate Pass, Foster confronted "Heaven's 
Ladder," 150 yards of nearly perpendicular ascent with a sheer drop on either 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall was one brick wide," Foster says. "I had to walk my bike. It took me 
an hour. If I fell off, I would have wound up in the valley a mile below." 
</P>
<P>
Foster had arranged for that possibility. He told his support team, "If I lose 
my life, try to bury me here. I don't want my body shipped back to the States." 
</P>
<P>
His body made it back to Ojai in one piece but not in great shape. "I'm shot," 
Foster said. Twice during the 52-day journey he was hospitalized, once for 
exhaustion, another time for a cracked rib sustained when an earthen section of 
the wall collapsed under him. The rib is healing, but Foster now has problems 
with his kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me I didn't drink enough water in the Gobi," he said. "I drank 
2 1/2 to three gallons a day, but I should have been drinking six in that 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
Foster often camped on the wall with his support team, then left them for a 
day's ride, rendezvousing with them late at night. They also stayed in remote 
villages, dining ceremoniously with local officials. "I had food you wouldn't 
believe," Foster said, mentioning pork lung and ox penis, which "tastes like 
escargot. You get used to it after a while." He also drank beinju, potent wine 
he calls "Chinese rocket fuel." 
</P>
<P>
Foster came in contact with many rural Chinese, whom he says were suspicious 
and curious. "In one town they lined up outside my hotel window to get a look 
at me," he said. "There were no curtains on the windows and I couldn't even get 
undressed." In local municipalities, he said, he had to bribe wall guards with 
cigarettes, even though the Communist government and the military supposedly 
had cleared the way for him. 
</P>
<P>
Those Chinese who got to know him "got to love me -- I was the crazy American," 
said Foster, who speaks enough broken Chinese to get by. Because of his long 
ponytail, they called him erizi, which means "half-man, half-woman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster rode through areas of China that seemed untouched by the 20th Century, 
but he often was surprised. In one village, he heard familiar sounds -- 
electronic beeps. A video game? He peered into a hut and saw a kid playing 
Super Mario Bros., one of Foster's favorites. The kid was playing badly, so 
Foster gave him a lesson, drawing a crowd as he got through all eight levels 
and saved the princess. 
</P>
<P>
"I was their hero," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Foster's life is a lot more mundane. He can be found in his Ojai 
back yard tinkering with "the bike that conquered the Great Wall," he said. 
Displaying a capitalistic flair that Chairman Mao would frown on, Foster is 
prepping the Cannondale for an Anaheim bike show, part of a marketing plan that 
also includes a video game, a possible article in National Geographic and a 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Foster puts the bike in a tool shed and removes from a gym bag a pancakelike 
stone artifact that he said he found in the ruins of a Buddhist temple. Then he 
unwraps his prized possession, a 30- to 40-pound brick from the Great Wall. The 
brick is embossed with Chinese characters, which, Foster explained, say that 
the brick was laid in 1,578 A. D. in Shendou Province during the reign of 
Emperor Wan-Li. 
</P>
<P>
Although Foster's wife, Anna, was enthusiastic about the trip, his parents were 
not thrilled. But he could have predicted that. Over the years, Foster's larks 
have alienated his parents, who live in Waterbury, Conn. "I'm the black sheep," 
he said. "My father calls me the bum." 
</P>
<P>
His quest to ride the Great Wall came to symbolize, he said, what they thought 
was a life wasted on trivial pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the oldest of four, expected to set the example. Get a job. Make some 
money. They didn't think this was a good example," Foster said. He persevered 
in pursuing his cycling adventure, he said, because he kept "hearing my 
mother's voice. She's saying, 'You're -- fill in the blank -- years old, what 
are you going to do with your life?' That compelled me to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Even during the years Foster battled government red tape, he did not endear 
himself to his parents by getting a job. He decided to use the time to try to 
break a Guinness world record by riding the entire New York subway system in 
the shortest time. Using computers and consulting math whizzes at Ventura 
College, Foster plotted his course over the 750 miles of underground track. He 
made the trip in 26 hours 21 minutes 8 seconds and didn't even get mugged. 
</P>
<P>
If Foster comes across as a little strange, well, that's because he admittedly 
is. At least he has been since the age of 8, when he touched a high-tension 
wire and was zapped by 65,000 volts of electricity. Nearly killed and not 
expected to walk again -- "I was Jello," he says -- he made a full recovery, 
and even claims that the jolt raised his IQ. 
</P>
<P>
The accident had a profound effect on his life. It made him grow up early, he 
said, and become a loner. It also gave him an early sense of his own mortality, 
which turned him into a risk-taker. "I don't care about death," he said. "Once 
you've died once, you don't think about it." 
</P>
<P>
What next for the intrepid adventurer? "I've been invited to do the first 
east-west crossing of the Sahara Desert" in 1991, he said, adding, "on a 
camel."DEBRA MYRENT / for The Times

L.A. HEAT GM OPPOSES MOVING TEAM TO O.C. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The appointment of veteran public relations expert Dick White as general 
manager of the Los Angeles Heat may signal that the American Professional 
Soccer League team will remain in the South Bay and not move to Orange County 
as previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
White, a former sports editor at the Torrance Daily Breeze who has held several 
professional sports management jobs over the past 25 years, was appointed 
Tuesday to replace Jill Fracisco, who was fired Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of El Camino College and a current board member of the school's 
fund-raising foundation, White, 50, opposes moving the team to Orange County 
for the 1991 season, a decision announced in August by club President John 
Ajemian. Ajemian's announcement has met with resistance from dissident South 
Bay owners and some league officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to Orange County," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian said in recent weeks it became clear that the Heat would have trouble 
finding a suitable stadium near Mission Viejo, his top choice. In addition, 
there is speculation that the San Diego Nomads, who did poorly at the gate 
after moving to Southwestern College in Chula Vista, are investigating a move 
into South Orange County. PAUL MCLEOD

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: WINLESS VENTURA FALLING BEHIND SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A clearly challenging schedule has proven even more difficult for the winless 
Ventura College football team than had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the Pirates' lone early-season break was supposed to be a Sept. 22 
game against West Los Angeles, which entered the season with a 21-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
However, West L. A. beat Ventura, 34-17, and this week moved into J.C. Athletic 
Bureau state rankings at No. 17 with a 3-0 record. The combined record of 
Ventura's opponents is 8-2. And the schedule doesn't get any easier. 
</P>
<P>
On tap Saturday is 3-0 Bakersfield, the top-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Off the charts: With five touchdowns in nine passes, Moorpark quarterback Del 
Marine has built a phenomenal passing-efficiency rating of 474.8. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring out the NCAA passing-efficiency formula used by junior colleges is 
about as easy as understanding special relativity, but suffice it to say that 
relative to other quarterbacks, Marine's rating is rather special. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, among the top 30 passers on the state junior college list, the 
highest rating is 180.3. The NCAA leader, Quinn Grovey of Arkansas, is at 194.1 
and the Pacific-10 Conference leader, Jason Palumbis of Stanford, has a 136.8 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
Add stats: Granted, it came against Ventura, the Western State Conference's 
worst defense, but Valley College's 300-yard rushing performance on Saturday 
quadrupled the Monarchs' yardage total from the first two games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (1-2, 1-1 in conference play) had a combined 75 yards in 63 carries in 
losses to Mt. San Antonio (50-18) and Moorpark (41-10). 
</P>
<P>
Hot hitters: Pierce won its first seven women's volleyball matches of the 
regular season and middle blockers Andrea Banducci and Lori Mertes have had a 
lot to do with the Brahmas' success. 
</P>
<P>
Banducci, a sophomore from Notre Dame High, and Mertes, a freshman from 
Chatsworth, have hitting percentages of .561 and .444, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both playing great volleyball right now," Pierce Coach Steve Gazzaniga 
said. "Hitting over .400 in volleyball is like hitting over .400 in baseball. 
It's very rare." 
</P>
<P>
Add Pierce: Although Gazzaniga lists Pierce's record as 7-0, the Brahmas have 
been beaten this season. 
</P>
<P>
It happened against Riverside in the championship match of the Cypress College 
tournament on Saturday. But because it was a one-set loss, 17-15, Gazzaniga 
doesn't include it in the Brahmas' record. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't count matches in our records unless it's two of three, or three or 
five," Gazzaniga explained. "To me, a one-set match doesn't necessarily prove 
which team is better." 
</P>
<P>
If Gazzaniga were to include tournament matches, Pierce would be 17-1, as the 
Brahmas went 10-1 in the Cypress tournament, including an 8-0 record in pool 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell beats the blitz: Former Cleveland High standout Sean Burwell turned a 
swing pass into a 31-yard touchdown Saturday in Oregon's 32-16 upset of Brigham 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know who had me, but he dropped off and the free safety let me 
go," Burwell said. "I was just hoping Bill (Musgrave, the Duck quarterback) 
would see me before the blitz got there." 
</P>
<P>
Burwell, a 5-foot-11, 181-pound redshirt freshman, also ran for 104 yards on 28 
carries. It was his second 100-yard rushing performance in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead: The Cal State Northridge men's cross-country team won its first 
invitational title in more than a decade at the UC Riverside Invitational last 
season, but Coach Don Strametz wasn't expecting the same this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Vujic and Jorge Castro, Northridge's top two runners at the meet last 
season, are redshirting and Strametz held this year's ace, Derik Vett, out of 
Saturday's rematch at Riverside. Strametz also pushed the squad through three 
hard workouts during the week in preparation for this weekend's Stanford 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
So the results from this season's invitational weren't surprising: The Matadors 
finished 16th out of 24 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Togetherness: The Occidental men's cross-country team was the top Division III 
team at Riverside, placing fourth behind defending California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, the Jamal Toads club team, 
and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Marcial Beltran placed fourth in 25 minutes 36 seconds over the 8,000-meter 
course, 26 seconds ahead of the Tigers' No. 2 runner, Jose Garcia, who placed 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
Beltran has been Occidental's pacesetter all season, but Coach Bill Harvey was 
pleased with the 1-minute 11-second gap between Garcia and his fifth man, Mike 
Anker (64th). 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to come together," Harvey said about the differential. 
</P>
<P>
The team gap had been more than 90 seconds at the Fresno Invitational on Sept. 
14.

CRAIG HARTLEY OCCIDENTAL

Football Running back 
</P>
<P>
Senior 6-foot, 185 pounds 
</P>
<P>
Craig Hartley, who hopes to become a podiatrist some day, used some fancy 
footwork to gain 228 yards in his debut at tailback Saturday for Occidental 
College. 
</P>
<P>
A converted defensive back, Hartley carried 39 times, although he barely made 
it to the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I started off breathing so hard, I couldn't catch my breath because I was so 
excited," Hartley said. "I was gasping because I had gotten myself so worked 
up." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was understandable. For three years Hartley has been a starter at 
defensive back. But when Brian Madlangbayan -- who was filling in for starting 
tailback Gary Little -- went out with a sprained neck, Hartley was called in 
against La Verne, which Occidental defeated, 38-27. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley, a history major who plans to follow his father into podiatry, got word 
he would be starting at tailback only three days before the game. He had been a 
part-time running back at McCullough High in Woodlands, Tex., located an hour 
north of Houston in the heart of oil country. 
</P>
<P>
In Woodlands, Occidental is the name of a petroleum company, not a college. 
Whatever, Hartley proved to be a slippery fellow against La Verne.

ROCKWELL GETS PACT FOR WORK ON MIDGETMAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: ANAHEIM DIVISION AWARDED $30.6-MILLION CONTRACT TO CONTINUE 
DEVELOPMENT OF MISSILE'S GUIDANCE SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
Rockwell International Corp. said Wednesday that it has won a $30.6-million 
contract to continue development of a guidance and control system for the 
Midgetman nuclear missile. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's Autonetics Strategic Systems Division in Anaheim won the one-year 
Air Force contract to continue work on the single-warhead Midgetman, formally 
known as the Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, which began work on the Midgetman in 1984, has 170 people employed on 
the program. No additional hiring is expected during the next year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the contract, Rockwell will develop an electronic chip system 
designed to better withstand radiation exposure in a nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Full-scale development work for the guidance and control program could boost 
the value of the contract to $470 million, based on current Air Force 
estimates, Rockwell officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar Lockwood, an analyst with the Arms Control Assn., a Washington think 
tank, said cuts in defense spending have resulted in the Midgetman program 
being stretched out. The Air Force has spent $3.3 billion on the program since 
1984. Before the recent award, Rockwell had received $390 million in contracts 
for the guidance and control system. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has proposed building 500 Midgetman missiles at a cost of $41.8 
billion, with deployment to begin in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has requested $202 million for Midgetman development 
during the fiscal year that began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With deep cuts expected in the Pentagon's budget and the prospect of a nuclear 
arms control agreement, the Democratic-controlled Congress is expected to 
support the Midgetman over the rail-based MX, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Since U.S. arms control negotiators have proposed a ban on multiple warhead 
missiles such as the MX, the Midgetman has a better chance for deployment. 
Proponents of the Midgetman contend that the system would be less vulnerable 
than the MX missile in the event of a massive nuclear strike.

DOLL FAILS TO MAKE IT OUT OF THE CRIB; 
</P>
<P>
TOYS: CHEERFUL TEARFUL, THOUGH BELOVED BY BUYERS, COULD NOT BE MANUFACTURED IN 
TIME FOR THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.

<P>
As toy companies go, Curiosity Products had gotten off to an enviable start. 
</P>
<P>
It had a blue-ribbon board of directors to watch over the creation of a 
high-tech baby doll -- Cheerful Tearful, which uses a computer chip to laugh, 
coo, cry or wet. The toy was the hit of the New York toy fair, garnering $15 
million in orders. And it got spots in Sears, Roebuck and J.C. Penney's 
Christmas catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
What's happened since then has been enough to make Cheerful Tearful cry and 
cry. The dolls cannot be produced in time for the crucial Christmas season, and 
probably won't be delivered until March. The president has resigned. The 
company is being renamed and restructured and it is being sued for not paying 
its rent. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of bringing the new doll to market in time for Christmas went awry 
because of a lack of financing, said Joseph Whitaker, Curiosity senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's money-raising marketplace, money had gotten pretty tight for some 
obvious reasons," he said, referring to the nationwide slump in retail sales. 
"It made the job (of raising investment money) extremely difficult." 
</P>
<P>
While Whitaker and Curiosity Chairman Joseph Delaney predict that the 
reorganized company will come back strong next year, the turn of events 
represents a steep slide from the early pronouncements of the new company about 
its cutting-edge toy. 
</P>
<P>
Cheerful Tearful performs some human functions just like some other baby dolls. 
But the secret that brought so much notice to the new doll was a computer 
microchip that can change the doll's emotions at random. 
</P>
<P>
The doll was promoted as catering to the nurturing instinct in children, 
beckoning them to play. In addition, the doll was designed to set a new 
standard in realism. Among its innovations was that it would lower its 
eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
And Curiosity had a star-studded board, including Mattel Inc. founder Elliot 
Handler, former CBS Chairman Arthur Taylor and Western Digital Corp. Chairman 
Roger Johnson. With such clout, the toy seemed certain to turn heads. 
</P>
<P>
It did. When Curiosity executives took a prototype of the doll to the American 
International Toy Fair in New York last February, they said potential buyers 
were standing four-deep to get a look. 
</P>
<P>
The doll was featured on the cover of the Playthings trade magazine in May. By 
summer, the company had racked up a respectable $15 million in orders. Toys R 
Us alone ordered 150,000, with a spokeswoman saying, "We expect her to do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
But the trouble struck over the summer. As the retail environment slowed and 
concerns about the economy grew, the new company was unable to come up with the 
money to get the doll manufactured, Delaney said. To make store shelves for 
Christmas, the doll had to begin coming off the production line in August. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the doll was displayed in the Sears Christmas "Wish Book" catalogue, 
retailing for $37.77, and in the J.C. Penney Christmas catalogue. "The J.C. 
Penney buyer told me the first week the doll was in the catalogue, it was the 
third best-selling doll" behind two nationally advertised models, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
But J.C. Penney spokesman Duncan Muir said orders were not that strong. And he 
said that people calling to order the doll are told that it will not be 
available for Christmas and that order takers recommend another doll. 
</P>
<P>
Muir said toys in the catalogue are occasionally unavailable, but "we obviously 
can't allow that to happen very often." 
</P>
<P>
The man who thought up the idea of creating a new toy company while walking his 
two Airedales one day, John Lynch, abruptly resigned as president in August. 
Reached at his Irvine home recently, Lynch demurred on why he left the company. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a whole bunch of reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also would not comment about the dispute on rent for the company's offices. 
The landlord sued Curiosity in August for $10,044 in back rent. The landlord's 
lawyer said Curiosity "never really moved in" to the Newport Beach offices, 
which were rented for $3,348 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said that in the wake of Curiosity's problems, he is folding the toy 
maker into the financial holding company that he founded, American Patriots 
Inc. The holding company was a secured creditor of Curiosity and is owed more 
than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said he believes that the company will be able to retain most of its 
customers for the Cheerful Tearful doll next year and will introduce other 
products as well. 
</P>
<P>
Since the doll has not been advertised on television, Delaney said he does not 
think that children will be disappointed about not being able to receive it in 
time for Christmas. "Most little girls won't know about this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he expressed confidence that the toy maker will be back. "I think it will 
just make more demand for it next year," he said about recent disappointing 
events. "This sort of things happens."

BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE: TWO COUNTY BANKS WILL CLOSE BRANCHES FOR LACK OF 
BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Banks are always looking to expand, but more bricks and mortar aren't always 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Two Orange County banks, for instance, are each closing a branch office by the 
end of the year because the amount of business doesn't justify the expense of 
maintaining the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
CommerceBank in Newport Beach has sent letters to customers of its El Modena 
branch in Orange saying that it will close the branch by the end of the year 
and transfer their accounts to the downtown Orange office. The branch came with 
the bank's acquisition of California City Bank earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The $8 million in deposits at the east side branch was well below the bank's 
average of $50 million per branch, said Clyde Gossert, the bank's president. In 
addition, the bank is primarily a business bank that holds large deposits from 
relatively few customers, and the El Modena branch holds mainly consumer 
checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark Bank in La Habra, meantime, is shutting down its Santa Fe Springs 
branch and moving the accounts to its main office. The Santa Fe Springs branch 
had deposits of $5 million, considerably lower than roughly $25 million at 
other branches. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Collette, Landmark's president, said the bank is consolidating its 
commercial services -- the prime activity at Santa Fe Springs -- in the main 
office. It plans to open two branches in more promising areas in west Orange 
County and west Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The branch closings must first be approved by state banking regulators.

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: DRUG TESTS HELP YOUTHS STAY CLEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Football players at Mission Viejo High School never know who is going to be 
tapped or when, but every day at least five of them have to report to the 
principal's office, grab a plastic cup and head for the nearest restroom. 
</P>
<P>
And within 24 hours, the verdict of the test for drugs and alcohol is mailed to 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, such has been the routine for about 100 players who 
voluntarily consent to confidential drug tests, the results of which are unseen 
by their coaches, teachers and administrators, but readily available to their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
This year, administrators have offered the program to 600 students, including 
all members of sports teams, band, drill team, cheerleading and student 
government. Close to 400 students have already signed up for the tests, which 
are patterned after a program at Edison High School in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
With the random tests, students have an acceptable excuse for saying no -- they 
might face a drug or alcohol test the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"If some big football stud or big man on campus says no, it might make someone 
else say no also. If just three or four kids do that, it will be worth it," 
said football Coach Dave Clark, who started the Mission Viejo program. 
</P>
<P>
The tests are done on campus by a private drug-testing firm for a $22 fee. 
Because of a court decision against a high school in Banning, school 
administrators are barred from requiring the tests or punishing students if 
test results are positive. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program has the support of the Football Boosters, the PTA and the 
school district, many students won't sign up because they consider it a 
violation of their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against it," said cross-country runner Cameron Pedego. "It's invading your 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
In three years, no football player has tested positive, according to the 
testing company. 
</P>

ATHLETE WAS GAME FOR SOVIET TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BILLIGMEIER, Eric Billigmeier is a senior at Esperanza High School, 
where he is editor of Aztlan, the student newspaper and president of the 
National Honor Society. He hopes to attend UCLA and major in communications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most high school students are at some point asked to write an essay for English 
class titled, "What I Did On My Summer Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Except Michele Fujioka. 
</P>
<P>
But if Fujioka, a senior at Esperanza High School in Anaheim, were asked to 
write such a paper, her piece would merit attention. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Fujioka's summer was spent traveling to the Soviet Union to play 
basketball with an all-star team of high school players from Northern and 
Southern California. The team visited three cities -- Helsinki, Tallinn and 
Leningrad -- on a 10-day trip sponsored by Amateur Sports Development of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Fujioka's first contact with a Soviet citizen took place on the ferry ride 
across the Baltic Sea from Helsinki to Tallinn, a city in Estonia, a republic 
that recently declared its independence from the Soviet Union. The man was a 
wrestler, who was "very friendly but didn't know a lot of English," Fujioka 
said, adding that this was quite common. 
</P>
<P>
"All the students over there have to learn English, so they all try and use it 
when they meet an American," she said. 
</P>
<P>
From the time Fujioka and her teammates stepped off the tour bus in their 
"USA"-emblazoned warm-ups to the time they boarded a jet to head home, they 
were hounded by people in search of American goods. 
</P>
<P>
In Tallinn, Fujioka said she was approached by young "merchants" selling such 
items as Soviet military hats and were looking to buy anything American -- from 
Levis to currency. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one guy on the streets who carried around a huge bag of rubles, 
asking to trade for American dollars," Fujioka said. "He really gave a great 
rate." 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad did not offer the same hospitality, according to Fujioka, who said 
its citizens "stared at you accusingly." 
</P>
<P>
"They were real bitter, especially the elderly." 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, a teammate bumped into a Soviet woman on the street. The woman 
grew quite angry and drew a crowd. The American girls, Fujioka said, just stood 
in the middle of a throng of people, not knowing how to calm the enraged woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Our only alternative was to nonchalantly walk away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fujioka said the government's influence on the everyday life of Soviet citizens 
was quite noticeable. She said there were "MPs (military police) out on the 
street, making sure the people know who's boss." 
</P>
<P>
Despite these few negative experiences, Fujioka said her trip gave her a true 
taste for Soviet life, including cigarette smoke. She said the smell of smoke 
was omnipresent, adding that smoking is "the cool thing to do there. Europeans 
drink and smoke like you wouldn't believe." 
</P>
<P>
Fujioka's favorite attraction in Leningrad was the Winter Palace, the place of 
residence for Russian czars of bygone eras. She also enjoyed seeing the "huge 
cathedrals with awesome architecture" as well as museums and statues of "just 
about every Russian leader who ever lived," which are located throughout the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball took a back seat to culture on the tour, which was obvious by the 
way the U.S. team played. Fujioka, a point guard, said the Americans lost all 
six games they played. 
</P>
<P>
Any excuses? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Fujioka said the Soviets were older, taller, concentrated better and were 
professionals, meaning they received stipends for their play. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, she said, "we got too lax on the basics. The Soviets have the fundamental 
skills so fine-tuned, it's hard to play against them. Still, the emphasis was 
not on winning but more for the experience. It was sort of like we took a break 
from touring to play a game." 
</P>
<P>
James and Barbara Fujioka, Michele's parents, were chaperones. Barbara Fujioka 
offered different reasons for the team's poor play: "Jet lag and no food both 
make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Several games, practice sessions and an all-day tournaments in Tallinn were 
canceled because of a lack of facilities -- the result of miscommunication, 
Fujioka said. 
</P>
<P>
However, on the day of the canceled tournament, Fujioka was invited to travel 
with one of the Soviet teams to spend a day at their sports camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a side of them that I wasn't used to or expecting," Fujioka said. "On 
television and in the movies, I saw Russia as real serious and everyone 
villain-like, but there I got to see them smile and have fun and act like 
normal teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
She did bring back a few souvenirs -- dolls and a porcelain kettle -- as well 
as a definite distaste for her host country's food. 
</P>
<P>
"The food was just horrible," Fujioka said. "Oh, man, it's at least five times 
worse than cafeteria food." 
</P>
<P>
Did the basketball defeats also leave her with a bad taste? 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice if we could have won a game or two," she said, "but 
I'm not really disturbed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing international basketball was a great experience, but the sightseeing, 
culture and learning experience itself were better than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Now, if her English teacher would just ask her to write that essay. . . .

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: 'TWO FUNNY' ARTISTS PUT SPARK IN READINGS WITH DOSE OF 
THEATRICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three years of presenting his Readers' Theater at various bookstores and 
libraries in Orange County, Steve Mellow is trying something new. 
</P>
<P>
He's bringing "Two Funny: An Evening With Barry Yourgrau and Sandra Tsing Loh" 
to the Backstage Theatre in Irvine on Friday and Saturday and again Oct. 12 and 
13. 
</P>
<P>
The show consists of solo turns by performance artist Loh and short story 
writer Yourgrau. 
</P>
<P>
Yourgrau's performance, titled "Safari," is taken from his collection of short 
stories, "Wearing Dad's Head," in which he uses a young boy's point of view to 
tell the odyssey of a father and son's big game hunt in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Loh, a classically trained pianist and effervescent performer, sits at her 
grand piano doing musical monologues on American movie musicals. Insight into 
Loh: She is best remembered as the woman who once gave a piano performance on 
the Harbor Freeway at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier run of "Two Funny" in Los Angeles this summer was described by 
theater critic Ray Loynd as "pristine, winsome and sublime, rather like 
watching a talented couple of people take over a cocktail party with some 
unexpected bits of beguilement. You want a different theatrical experience -- 
this is one opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
A preview of the artists is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. tonight at the San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library. Admission is free. Mellow said the preview 
performance will differ from the weekend's. And as with Readers' Theater, he 
said, the audience will have the opportunity to read with Yourgrau from his 
works. 
</P>
<P>
For Mellow, who is producing the Backstage Theatre production, bringing 
Yourgrau to Orange County was a natural. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been reading from his works as long as I've been doing Readers' 
Theater," said Mellow, a Santa Ana resident. "He's been a favorite author of 
mine. He writes surreal and hilarious stories. 'Wearing Dad's Head' is a real 
underground work. When I did it at Scribner's (bookstore) they used to sell out 
every one of his books." 
</P>
<P>
Mellow said Yourgrau has done several pieces that are now appearing on MTV and 
he has developed a new piece for the Ha Comedy Channel; Loh is currently 
recording a new album. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow said he chose the Backstage Theatre because he "wanted to start bringing 
more literate programming into Orange County and I felt presenting this as a 
theatrical event would start to give people an alternative theater choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to this coming weekend being successful enough so I can 
put more programs of this kind together." 
</P>
<P>
Seating at the 45-seat Backstage Theatre is limited. Tickets are $15. For 
reservations, call Mellow at (714) 972-1690. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Two Funny" is his first "hard-ticket" production in Orange County, 
Mellow is not abandoning his monthly evenings of Readers' Theater at the 
Newport Beach Public Library at Newport Center and the San Juan Capistrano 
Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has added a new twist to having audience members read from the 
works of various authors: He's now featuring appearances by authors who read 
from their own works. 
</P>
<P>
In September, author and Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith drew an 
audience of 300 for his appearances in Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
Laguna Beach author T. Jefferson Parker will read at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 24 at the 
Newport Beach Public Library and Oct. 25 at the library in San Juan Capistrano. 
Mellow also has Ray Bradbury lined up for Nov. 29 in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to continue with live authors," said Mellow, adding that he is also 
looking into shooting a TV pilot of authors reading their works at his Orange 
County Readers' Theater. "I just want to keep upping the ante in terms of 
getting people excited about reading." 
</P>
<P>
Poets Reading: Laguna Beach poet Gene Gallun will bring his brand of fiery, 
contemporary poetry to the Poets Reading meeting at 8 p.m. Saturday at the 
Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N. Pomona Ave. Gallun will be followed by an open 
poetry reading. Admission: $3. 
</P>
<P>
Used Books: Friends of the Fullerton Public Library will hold a used book sale 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the library, 353 W. Commonwealth Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The sale begins at 10 a.m. Friday for members of the Friends. (Memberships will 
be available at the door.) The public will be admitted from 1 to 4 p.m. Sale 
hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and from 1 to 4 p.m. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from 50 cents to $2. 
</P>
<P>
Anniversary: The Book Harbor in Fullerton, 201 N. Harbor Blvd., will celebrate 
its 12th anniversary this month with a monthlong sale. Everything in the store 
will be discounted 30%. The Book Harbor sells new and used books and has 75,000 
volumes in more than 200 subject areas. Included are 7,500 first editions. 
Owner Al Ralston says the store also has recently become a "last outpost" for 
vinyl record collectors.

FIRST PERSON: RAIL COMMUTERS LOSE TRACK OF TIME -- AND SOME TRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Amtrak's northbound San Diegan pulls into San Juan Capistrano on time, loads up 
with about 100 passengers, blows its lonely whistle -- and promptly heads 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 After riders scream obscenities at the conductor and he does the same to the 
engineer, the train comes to a halt, idles a few minutes and then gets back on 
course, having lost only eight miles and about 20 minutes to schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the wacky world of commuting by rail to Los Angeles, an adventure 
undertaken each day by several hundred of us who live in San Diego or Orange 
counties and work downtown. 
</P>
<P>
We all tell ourselves and our co-workers that it beats driving the freeways, 
but sometimes it takes all the skills of a Hesperia land agent to make it 
convincing. 
</P>
<P>
Like the recent day when the train didn't show up at all, which is not that 
unusual an occurrence and one that is particularly bedeviling to those boarding 
at such places as San Juan Capistrano, which has no station and consequently no 
station master or other personnel to pass on information. 
</P>
<P>
I generally take what is supposed to be the 6:40 a.m. train and passengers 
begin lining up on the platform about 6:30. By 6:45 on this particular day, 
people are staring down the tracks and straining to hear the whistle as the 
train makes the curve at Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, about 7:05, the crossing lights activate and the guards come down. We 
all line up again -- only to watch a freight rumble through at a high speed, 
its open cars densely populated by waving illegals. 
</P>
<P>
By 7:15, the grumbling has gotten louder and someone finally goes across the 
street to the phone and calls Amtrak. He comes back, talks to a few people and 
they all start leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The word is that the train had broken down somewhere south of Del Mar. The 
second train, due at 7:40, has left San Diego and barring any mishap will be 
arriving about half an hour late after picking up those stranded south of Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
It arrives about 8:15, pulling six cars. The earlier train boasts seven cars, 
so we wind up with 13 cars of passengers crammed into six, all envying the 
illegals on that freight with the wind blowing in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
The cars are so crowded, no one can make it to the club car for coffee or to 
the restroom, either, and it is a credit to the dedication of the conductors 
that they are able to collect every single ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Mussolini when we need him?" yells out one passenger, leaving it 
unclear whether he's referring to the myth that the Italian dictator made the 
trains run on time or whether he's wishing for someone to hang up by the heels, 
as the partisans did when they caught up with Il Duce. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Anaheim, the train pulls into a siding and sits there idling. 
About 10 minutes go by and finally so does a freight (America is the only 
nation where freight has priority over passenger trains). 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the train will pull into a siding and nothing but time goes by. When 
asked why we're sitting there, conductors will reply "Orange Block" or "Red 
Block," as if we're all familiar with rail terminology. (After about 12 years 
of riding the San Diegan, I still don't know -- nor care about, if truth be 
known -- the difference between the two.) 
</P>
<P>
And while it is extremely rare for the train to go in the wrong direction, it 
is fairly common for passengers to do so because the locomotive these days 
always points north. 
</P>
<P>
Southbound trains are pushed, northbound pulled. So at those stations 
(Fullerton and Santa Ana) where the twain meet, it is easy for the neophyte to 
assume both are heading for Los Angeles and board a train going to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Engine breakdowns are also fairly common and always in unlikely places, far 
from an escape route. And when the engine goes, so go lights and air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, I had an afternoon doctor's appointment in Mission Viejo at 
4:30, so I took the 2:45 out of Los Angeles, scheduled to arrive in San Juan 
Capistrano at 4. Somewhere between Santa Ana and Irvine, the train hit 
something left on the tracks (when kids aren't throwing rocks at the train, 
they're piling rubbish on the tracks) and lost all power. 
</P>
<P>
We sat for about 20 minutes while train personnel wandered around outside 
scratching their heads and muttering to each other, but not saying a word to 
the passengers (like doctors who are extremely reluctant to share professional 
information with patients). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one passenger disembarked, suit jacket slung over a shoulder, 
briefcase in hand. "Hey!" hollered the conductor. "Get back on the train! You 
can't just get off. What's wrong with you? Get back here!" 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do, shoot me?" the passenger snapped as he scrambled up 
an embankment and headed into a grove of trees. The rest of us waited the 40 
minutes or so for repairs to be made. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes we're lucky and the engine breaks down close to Union Station and 
they can send a new replacement locomotive and get it hooked up in a few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there was the notorious incident last year when an incoming train 
broke down a few miles south of Los Angeles and sat there for hours. That's the 
one where the crew members abandoned ship because their shift was up, leaving 
passengers in the heat and literally in the dark until help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
An even greater challenge can await those who for whatever reason are forced to 
take the last train out in the evening -- at 9:05. 
</P>
<P>
I had that experience several months ago, breaking my neck to get to the 
station around 8:50 and running to the platform only to find it empty. Spotting 
an Amtrak employee, I asked about the train, fearing that it might have already 
departed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to find one now," he said, looking around as if he'd dropped a 
coin in the dark. "I can't lose a cat," I said. "How do you lose a train?" 
</P>
<P>
Turns out three times a week, that last train out must wait for the train from 
Chicago because those passengers have guaranteed connections to points south. 
And there are some suspicions that the last time the Chicago train was on time, 
Harry Truman was vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there's no entertainment value to riding Amtrak, especially south of 
San Clemente. While little kids throw rocks at the train, the bigger ones -- 
especially surfers, for some reason -- seem compelled to do a little mooning 
whenever a train goes by. In Mission Viejo, there's even an organized mooning 
performance once a year when several hundred bar patrons turn out on an 
appointed day and all drop their pants to salute the passing train. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of it all, though, I will continue shelling out $88 per week to ride 
the rails because it beats driving the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it's only late when I have an important appointment.

Stikkitty, a hard-rock band from Fullerton, will receive $10,000 and a date at 
Tokyo's famous Budokhan Theatre as winner of a national contest for unsigned 
rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
The "Soundcheck" contest finals took place Tuesday night at the Roxy in 
Hollywood and were judged by a panel of record producers and major label talent 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Stikkitty defeated four other contenders -- from Santa Monica, Detroit, Atlanta 
and New York City -- after each band played two original songs. 
</P>
<P>
Stikkitty's singer, Vincent K., also received $1,000 as outstanding vocalist in 
the contest, which is sponsored by Yamaha. Another Stikkitty member, Dwayne 
Allen, won $1,000 as outstanding bassist. Stikkitty, which also includes 
guitarist John Gurzi and drummer David Outzs, will represent the United States 
at "Band Explosion," an international rock festival in Tokyo on Oct. 28. MIKE

POPBEAT: UNSTABLE REACTIONS OUR FAULT, NOT ARTIST'S; 
</P>
<P>
THE WAYS THAT ONE IS AFFECTED BY ART DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL. ROCK MUSICIANS 
LIKE OZZY OSBOURNE ARE NO MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN GOETHE OR SHAKESPEARE FOR 
'ENCOURAGING' SUICIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The artist was obsessed with hell, death and Satan. One of the works that made 
him famous inspired suicides. Clergy condemned it; local governments banned it. 
</P>
<P>
And all of this happened more than 200 years before Ozzy Osbourne ever chomped 
on a bat. 
</P>
<P>
These days Ozzy's darker preoccupations are being picked apart in a Georgia 
court, where he is accused in a civil suit of causing the deaths of two 
teen-agers who did themselves in after listening to his song, "Suicide 
Solution" (see story on F1). Osbourne's heavy metal colleagues and fellow 
Britons, Judas Priest, recently mounted a successful defense against a similar 
suit in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps these rockers can take some comfort, or at least some bitter 
satisfaction, in knowing that much the same thing happened to Johann Wolfgang 
von Goethe, the German Romantic poet whose spot on Western civilization's 
all-time hit parade is quite secure. 
</P>
<P>
In 1774, Goethe published "The Sufferings of Young Werther." The novel's hero 
is a sensitive, extravagantly emotional aspiring artist who loses the love of 
his life to a rival, then shoots himself to end his torment. In its day, 
according to Goethe biographers, the book touched off an entertainment 
sensation that sounds a bit like the hysteria that today attends the likes of 
Madonna, Michael Jackson and New Kids on the Block. Much to Goethe's own 
disgust, "Werther" became a pop phenomenon and a marketable commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Young men throughout Germany began wearing the blue waistcoat in which Goethe 
had garbed his unfortunate hero. Scenes and characters from the novel turned up 
as decorations for knickknacks, souvenirs and household items. Other writers 
began churning out their own versions of the "Werther" story. And there were 
copycat suicides, like the one recounted by Goethe biographer Richard 
Friedenthal, in which a Werther fan opened the book to the death scene, invited 
others to watch, then dispatched himself with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
If he were writing in contemporary America, Goethe probably would be defending 
himself in court for an episode like that. Or is it just heavy metal singers, 
among all other artists, who must answer for the way in which unstable people 
react to their songs? 
</P>
<P>
From Goethe to Ozzy Osbourne -- admittedly quite a qualitative leap -- art 
gravitates toward extremes of feeling and experience because that is where 
human behavior becomes most vivid and interesting. Those extremes also carry 
the greatest emotional impact. But at the point of impact, it's no longer the 
artist, but the beholder, who becomes the active agent: How we're affected by a 
song depends on how we imagine, interpret and respond to it. If harm comes to 
us from that interaction, the fault lies not in our pop stars, but in 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting Osbourne for "Suicide Solution" seems particularly unjust. Far from 
advocating suicide, the song is a sardonic portrayal of a booze-addled 
protagonist for whom the bottle becomes an instrument of self-destruction 
("solution," in the song, means a liquid -- namely whiskey, as well as a way to 
end a problem). It's hard for a rational listener to miss the sarcasm as 
Osbourne sings lines like "Where to hide? Suicide is the only way out." It's a 
description of a pathetic state of mind, not an endorsement of that mind's 
tormented logic. 
</P>
<P>
The Osbourne case, like the Judas Priest trial, rests on a claim that the 
victims fell under the spell of subliminal messages embedded in the song. If 
such messages are there, a few million listeners have been exposed without 
apparent ill effects. But what if the plaintiff's lawyers are right, and 
suicidal themes in pop songs are indeed dangerous? Well, look out, world, 
because the music-loving masses have been battered quite often with these dark 
horrors. Maybe those who haven't succumbed yet should count themselves lucky. 
Or maybe they should start pruning their music collections before their luck 
runs out. 
</P>
<P>
If Ozzy is a threat, all you Clint Black fans may want to see a therapist, just 
as a preventive measure to ward off the not-so-subliminal message you've 
absorbed from Black's Number One country hit, "Killin' Time." The song is a 
virtual replay of the "Suicide Solution" scenario: Troubled protagonist turns 
to alcohol as method of self-annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
How about Bobby Gentry's "Ode to Billie Joe," which topped the pop charts for a 
month in the summer of 1967? Does that song stir in you an urge to follow the 
lead of Billie Joe McAllister, the song's enigmatic suicide victim, and take a 
header from the Tallahatchie Bridge (or some handier local span)? 
</P>
<P>
No rockers ever made death sound quite so alluring as Blue Oyster Cult did with 
"(Don't Fear) the Reaper," a 1976 hit that became one of the most played songs 
in the history of the album-rock radio format. The thrust of the lyric is that 
death is a liberating experience, to be embraced, even courted. Young Werther 
would have loved its dark romanticism: 
</P>
<P>
Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We can be like they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't fear the reaper. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll be able to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Romeo and Juliet, perhaps high schools and colleges that teach 
Shakespeare should start worrying about their legal liability, in case 
something tragic happens after English class. What ideas might that double 
suicide at the end of "Romeo and Juliet" put in tender noggins? If it's the 
artist's obligation not to cast shadows on the beholder's presumably sunny 
state of mind -- as the Osbourne and Judas Priest suits imply -- the Bard is 
strictly bad news. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, tragic art, if it is particularly believable and evocative, can be a 
cathartic vehicle that helps us accept life's painful side without being 
overcome by it. Once or twice when I've found myself in a particularly bleak 
mood, I've deliberately thrown Lou Reed's "Berlin" album on the turntable. 
Perhaps the most depressing rock album ever made, it tells the sordid story, 
ending with a suicidal razor stroke to the wrist, of a man and a woman 
destroying each other with their weaknesses and vices. After a good wallow in 
"Berlin," the only way your mood can go is up. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to imagine a lonely, unhappy listener taking comfort from Stephen 
Stills' "4+20" or the Youngbloods' "Darkness, Darkness," two well-known 
folk-rock songs that portray yearning for a final release from worldly 
troubles. Instead of encouraging suicidal thinking, these songs serve as 
reminders that it isn't shameful or abnormal to feel awful inside. Others have 
felt the same way, and from their trouble they have fashioned something rich 
with honest feeling. 
</P>
<P>
That, rather than prompting suicides, was the artistic aim Goethe expressed in 
this brief note to his readers, which serves as a preamble to the tale of poor, 
doomed Werther: 
</P>
<P>
And you, good soul, who are feeling the same anguish as (Werther), draw 
consolation from his sufferings, and let this little book be your friend, if 
fate or your own fault prevent you from finding a closer one.

FIELDER HITS NO. 50, ADDS NO. 51, TOO

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cecil Fielder became the first American Leaguer to hit 50 home runs since Roger 
Maris and Mickey Mantle did it 29 years ago, connecting Wednesday night in the 
fourth inning and later adding No. 51 in the final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of pressure," Fielder said. "I wouldn't wish that on anyone in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit first baseman is the 11th player to hit 50 homers and the first 
since George Foster of the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. The feat has been 
accomplished 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, who walked and lined out in his first two at-bats, sent a 2-and-1 
pitch from New York Yankee rookie Steve Adkins into the first row of the upper 
deck in left field in the fourth. He took four steps out of the batter's box, 
watched to see if the ball would hook foul, and when it didn't, he began 
jumping up and down and pumping both fists into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relief," he said. "I got so excited, I jumped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
The two-run homer put Detroit ahead, 6-0. After striking out, increasing his 
major league-leading total to 182, Fielder hit a three-run homer in the eighth 
off Alan Mills into the lower deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder led the majors in homers and with 132 RBIs this season. He had gone two 
for 21 since his last home run; his longest drought of the year without a homer 
was 45 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder went 0 for 4 in each of the first two games of the season-ending series 
at Yankee Stadium. He struck out five times, popped out twice and grounded to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson moved Fielder 
from the third spot in the lineup to second, hoping to get him an extra at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Of the last five players to hit 50 home runs, four were named most valuable 
player. The only one who missed out was Mantle, who hit 54 homers to Maris' 
record 61 in 1961 in the home run race between Yankee teammates.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some of San Diego's wisest urban planners aren't urban planners at all, just 
San Diegans with a sincere concern for their city. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them turned out last week for two forums on public spaces led by San 
Diego City Architect Mike Stepner and organized by various civic and 
professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, a group of about 200 gathered at the Casa del Prado Theater in 
Balboa Park for a "town meeting" on the subject of public squares. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a slide lecture on the Pioneer Courthouse Square, a 
lively downtown plaza in Portland, Ore., that covers an entire city block. A 
thoughtful discussion followed, with comments from both the audience and a 
panel whose members ranged from Tim Chambers of San Diego Espresso Company to 
developer Ernest Hahn, artist Mario Lara and the city's Commission for Arts and 
Culture public arts coordinator Gail Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, many of the same faces returned to Balboa Park to see how 
lessons learned the night before might apply to three San Diego public spaces 
in dire need of attention: Horton Plaza Park, the Community Concourse, both 
downtown, and the Plaza de Panama in front of the San Diego Museum of Art in 
Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
David Porter, who manages Pioneer Courthouse Square and organizes its events, 
was the featured guest at both meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But the real star of the discussions wasn't a participant. The name of 
pioneering urban planner William Whyte surfaced often at both meetings. His 
1988 book "City: Rediscovering the Center" has become something of a bible to 
anyone with an interest in a vital public spaces. It seems even the general 
public now knows about him. 
</P>
<P>
Whyte spent years in New York City researching what makes public spaces come 
alive. Many of his recommendations are simple, but it's surprising how seldom 
they are followed. 
</P>
<P>
People need places to sit, Whyte says. They need plenty to do and see: art, 
retail shops with their wares in full view, street performers, food vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Courthouse Square puts these ideas to work. It gives Portland the kind 
of public heart downtown San Diego has never had. People from a variety of 
socioeconomic groups mingle peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
According to Porter, the success of Pioneer Courthouse Square is attributable 
to six concepts: simplicity, location, history, ownership, activity and 
neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Courthouse Square has a clean, functional design, yet plenty of whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
Portland dreamed up a way to give citizens a stake in the project: 65,000 
bricks were sold for $15 to $30 and used to pave the square, each with the 
donor's name on them. 
</P>
<P>
The square has action galore: a travel bookstore, four food vendors, a 
restaurant, interactive art pieces and such events as an annual "Festival of 
Flowers" and noontime "Peanut Butter and Jam" concerts. 
</P>
<P>
A weather machine gives the forecast, accompanied by a fanfare of trumpets, 
sprays of water and flashing temperature lights. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Horton Plaza Park is a prime candidate for such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the city's lack of initiative in finding ways to reclaim the park 
from downtown's street people, the Central City Assn., an organization 
representing downtown businesses, has proposed to the city council to replace 
the grass with flower beds. It is even ready to pay to do so, but hasn't gotten 
the council's approval yet. 
</P>
<P>
This might help keep the transients away, but it still wouldn't make the park a 
great place for a cross section of the public to gather and mingle. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 50 or so planners, artists, business people and others who met with 
Stepner and Porter Friday agreed that the long range goal should be to replace 
the landscaping around the 1910 Irving Gill fountain with hardscaping -- bricks 
or another paving material. An open, paved park would offer people places to 
congregate and allow for a variety of uses, while plans dominated by grass 
and/or flower beds have limited possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Leo Sullivan is a partner in a law firm with offices across Fourth 
Avenue from Horton Plaza Park. He is also co-owner of Reidy O'Neil's restaurant 
on the ground floor of the building, which has a view of the troubled park. 
</P>
<P>
In making his pitch, Sullivan cited Whyte. He suggested replacing straight 
benches with round, backless ones more suited to group conversations. He 
proposed an entertainment stage, a food stand and night lights that would play 
on the park from adjacent buildings. 
</P>
<P>
These ideas aren't in the Central City Assn.'s plan, and Stepner endorsed the 
association's flower beds as a short-term solution. In fact, the hardscaping, 
which seems like an excellent idea, may never happen. Posts and chains 
bordering the grass are period pieces, and historic preservationists strongly 
oppose their removal. 
</P>
<P>
Whyte-like ideas also flowed during Friday's discussion of the Community 
Concourse. Ernesto Guerrero, director of the Centro Cultural de la Raza who was 
also on the panel, proposed a radical solution to the plaza's hostile, windy 
environment: destroy some of the sterile buildings around it. 
</P>
<P>
More realistic suggestions included a city commitment to managing the space 
(including new art and events), food and retail outlets, a new downtown library 
at the plaza's edge, more seating and a landscaping plan that would open better 
lines of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Porter believes the Community Concourse desperately needs public art that 
acknowledges local history and adds a taste of San Diego's broad cultural 
heritage. History and broad-based art could help make the space appealing to 
more San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
The city has commissioned a community concourse reuse study, and Stepner 
promised to forward several of these ideas. 
</P>
<P>
In Balboa Park, the Plaza de Panama was converted this summer from a parking 
lot while it was occupied by a touring Frank Lloyd Wright house. Long-range, 
the city plans to replace the parking lot with a plaza. Landscape architect 
Steve Estrada, a consultant hired by the city to draft a detailed plan for the 
heart of the park, proposes a fountain in the middle of the Plaza de Panama, 
palms around its fringes and a large, hardscaped surface where people can 
gather. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas proposed for the Plaza de Panama weren't as interesting as suggestions 
made for the other two public spaces. A major portion of the debate focused on 
whether automobiles should be allowed to cross the edge of the plaza, and where 
new parking lots might be built in the park.

ART: DAVID GEFFEN PLANS TO SELL OFF LAVISH FURNISHINGS FROM THE FORMER HOME OF 
FILM PRODUCER JACK WARNER. CHRISTIE'S ESTIMATES THE SALE WILL EXCEED $4 
MILLION.

Record producer David Geffen made the news earlier this year when he sold his 
record company to MCA Inc. in a deal then worth more than $500 million. Geffen 
then turned around and reportedly paid a whopping $47 million for a 10-acre 
Beverly Hills estate that belonged to the late film producer Jack L. Warner and 
his wife, Ann Page Alvarado Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen, whose MCA holdings could be worth as much as $900 million if MCA is 
acquired by Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric, acquired a grand 
residence designed in the 1930s by architect Roland Coate, but the deal also 
included a houseful of English furniture, decorative objects and porcelain, 
plus Warner's collection of eight Oscars and all his leather-bound film 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen has already recouped a reported $3 million by selling the Oscars and 
scripts to Warner Bros. Now he plans to put the furnishings on the auction 
block, on Oct. 12 at Christie's New York. Sales are expected to total more than 
$4 million, according to the Park Avenue auction house. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen said that he decided to sell the Warner furnishings because the house 
was "much too much of a museum" and far too formal for his tastes. "I collect 
contemporary art, and I don't live that way," Geffen said in a telephone 
interview. Many of the ornate furnishings, architectural elements and 
decorative objects in the neoclassical mansion were selected for the Warners by 
Billy Haines, a decorator to the stars for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Top lots in the auction include a pair of George III gilded wood mirrors 
(estimated at $200,000 to $300,000), a George II lady's writing desk inspired 
by a Chippendale design ($200,000 to $300,000) and a Dutch neoclassical 
tulipwood and engraved glass cabinet ($70,000 to $100,000). 
</P>
<P>
Architectural elements installed by Haines are also for sale. Among them are a 
set of early 19th-Century French panels of hand-painted wallpaper ($30,000 to 
$40,000) and a George III-style marble and lapis lazuli fireplace ($30,000 to 
$50,000). A portrait of Ann Warner by Salvador Dali (estimated at $600,000 to 
$800,000) will be offered separately, in Christie's Nov. 15 sale of 
Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen said he does not live in the Warner house and won't do so for about a 
year because it is undergoing an extensive renovation. When he takes up 
residence there, he will install his art collection, including contemporary 
works by David Hockney, Sam Francis and Morris Louis and modern pieces by Rene 
Magritte and Fernand Leger. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen holds 1 million shares of a special MCA preferred stock, which he 
received when he sold his record company to the entertainment conglomerate in 
March. Geffen's preferred shares can be converted into 10 million shares of 
common stock, currently worth about $600 million but worth $900 million if MCA 
is sold to Matsushita for $90 a share. Unless MCA itself is sold, however, 
Geffen is limited in how he can convert his shares; under an agreement with the 
company, he cannot sell all of his stock at once or to a single buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, a founder of Warner Bros. Studio, died in 1978 at the age of 86. The 
child of a poor Russian immigrant family, he rose quickly in the entertainment 
field. He and his brothers -- Sam, Harry and Albert -- staged productions 
around their hometown of Youngstown, Ohio. Later, they opened a theater in 
Newcastle, Pa., and produced films in New York before coming to Hollywood. Jack 
L. Warner is credited as the producer of nearly 1,500 films. Three of them, 
"The Life of Emile Zola" (1937), "Casablanca" (1943) and "My Fair Lady" (1964), 
won Oscars for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
Warner and his wife, who died last March at 82, often entertained at their 
lavish home during Hollywood's heyday. "The glamour of the golden age of 
Hollywood was exemplified in the Warner home, and echoed in the exceptional 
number of high-quality English furniture and decorations," said William J. 
Iselin, Christie's head of European furniture.

On the night of May 2, 1986, Michael Jeffery Waller attended a beer bash at a 
friend's house in Fitzgerald, Ga., whose parents were out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Waller -- a 16-year-old student who wasn't known to take drugs -- spent much of 
the evening driving about, drinking beer and listening to heavy metal music 
behind the house with friends in the cab of his pickup truck. According to 
Waller's father and the police, Ozzy Osbourne's "Blizzard of Oz" was the last 
tape the teen-ager listened to before returning to the party. 
</P>
<P>
At about 2 a.m. on May 3, Waller entered the kitchen and asked his friends to 
take a seat on the couch facing him. After writing a suicide note, he picked up 
a handgun, leaned back on a kitchen stool and blew a hole through the 
refrigerator door. He then raised the pistol to his right temple and pulled the 
trigger. Waller died immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Neither police nor Ben Mills, the Fitzgerald, attorney presenting the lawsuit 
against Osbourne, would reveal the contents of the suicide note, but Waller's 
father said the youth had been frustrated and depressed about a 
driving-under-the-influence violation he received about four weeks prior to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before his son killed himself, Waller said he had a talk with the boy 
and assured him that they would work things out regarding the pending 
D.U.I.-related court date. 
</P>
<P>
"What he said to me was, he said, 'Pop, I believe old Oz has the solution,' " 
the elder Waller recalled. "But it wasn't until after the shooting, until I 
found the cassette in his tape deck, that I understood what the youngin' was 
talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to his suicide, Harold Mathew Hamilton -- a 17-year-old high school 
dropout with a criminal record and a history of drug and alcohol abuse -- 
seemed to be on the road to recovery. While he still used pot and alcohol, the 
boy had found a steady job as a cabinet maker and appeared to be stable and 
satisfied, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the early morning hours of March 20, 1988, Harold wrote a suicide note 
to his sister, borrowed a car and gun from a friend's trailer with whom he had 
been boarding and stopped by to visit his mother. 
</P>
<P>
He told her that he had just returned from a party in Charleston, S.C., where a 
girl he liked had rejected his advances. His mother said Harold seemed visibly 
upset and told her he intended to drive across the border to Augusta, Ga., to 
visit his sister. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., Hamilton's car was found by a stranger parked in the driveway of a 
home in rural Washington County, Ga., 50 miles northwest of Augusta. Draped 
across the front seat with a pistol in his hand and a bullet hole in his 
temple, Hamilton was still alive. A cassette of Osbourne's 1976 album, 
"Tribute," was in the tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
Police rushed him to the hospital, but he died seven hours later. A coroner's 
jury ruled his death a suicide, Chief Deputy Mike Moore, of the Washington 
County Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, I said, 'Howie what's wrong?' " said Hamilton's mother, recalling 
the conversation she had with her son seven hours before he shot himself. "He 
said, 'Mom, you'll never see me again.' " CHUCK PHILIPS

3 STATIONS LIFT BANS ON POLITICAL ADS IN NEWSCASTS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CHANNELS 2, 4 AND 5 JOIN OTHERS IN BOWING TO ECONOMIC FACTORS. SOME 
FEAR THAT ADS MAY BE MISCONSTRUED AS NEWS.

Despite previous concerns over the dangers of broadcasting paid political 
advertising within their newscasts, KCBS Channel 2, KNBC Channel 4 and KTLA 
Channel 5 have recently lifted their longtime policy prohibiting such ads in 
order to keep up economically with other local television stations. 
</P>
<P>
The other four major Los Angeles stations have all been accepting political ads 
during their newscasts for some time now, ignoring concerns that such ads might 
be misconstrued by some viewers as news. Both KABC Channel 7 and KCOP Channel 
13 have sold political time during news for more than two years. KTTV Channel 
11 has accepted those ads during news since last February. A spokeswoman at 
KCAL Channel 9 could only say that her station has been doing so for some time. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS began accepting such ads in August "on a trial basis," a station 
spokeswoman said, "in order to make more time available to the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Emerson, KNBC's manager of broadcast standards, said that the station 
decided just two weeks ago to sell time to candidates during newscasts because 
the time available outside of news was severely limited and therefore the cost 
for spots was higher. "This way we are able to give more access to political 
candidates at cheaper rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the primary reason for the change in policy is economics. Many political 
candidates prefer to buy time in newscasts because such programs are perceived 
as credible and objective, and because news viewers are thought to be likely 
voters. So a station that turns down such advertising is simply directing 
revenue toward its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remain competitive," Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA spokesman Ed Harrison said that, until a week ago, the station had refused 
paid political ads during news because it did not want to be perceived as 
biased toward one side or the other. After KCBS and KNBC flip-flopped on this 
issue, however, KTLA went along with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the station changed the policy because it would lose ad revenue 
if it adhered to its previous position, Harrison said, "Let's just say that you 
have to remain competitive." 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly an economic issue," said Dan Gingold, assistant professor of 
journalism at USC and a onetime executive producer of news at Channel 2. 
"Business being what it is, with stations seeing their profits shrinking, they 
have to get revenue wherever they can. When these candidates come in with cash 
in hand, stations are willing to push the envelope and compromise a little." 
</P>
<P>
Gingold contended that it is "dangerous" to mix the "unilateral assault" of 
paid political ads with an objective, balanced newscast. He said, for example, 
that if a station presents a political package on the governor's race, complete 
with excerpts from interviews conducted with both Pete Wilson and Dianne 
Feinstein, for example, and then an ad for Wilson pops up after the report that 
denounces Feinstein, Wilson would appear to get in the last word. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson said that station policy dictates that all political commercials during 
KNBC's newscasts be sandwiched between other types of commercials so that the 
paid political spot does not bump directly against the newscast. 
</P>
<P>
KTTV tries to avoid this problem by accepting such ads only during the 
feature-heavy last half-hour of its hourlong newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Feldman, KCOP's station manager, said that he believes viewers can tell 
the difference between news and advertising. 
</P>

"I have always thought that news is a natural environment for such ads," he 
said. "I think it helps the political process. It's productive for people who 
are interested in the campaign to see the unbiased news reports on the race and 
then compare how the candidates are presenting themselves in their

Feldman said that his station reviews each commercial on an individual basis

LONDON PLAYGOING: RICHARD HARRIS AND DEREK JACOBI GIVE PERFORMANCES THAT THE

<TEXT>
<P>
Inflation is as universal as Burger King and Pizza Hut, which now raise their 
garish facades everywhere in the land of Dickens, Sherlock Holmes and 
Christopher Wren. 
</P>
<P>
Memory, which does have a merry way of telescoping 30 years into several fewer 
than that, says that a pound or two or three got you a good seat at any London 
play. That was within 10 bucks, and the memory was old but accurate. The scale 
here is still better than in New York, where I recently paid $50 for a balcony 
seat to "City of Angels" and $45 for an equally distant view of Maggie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
I winced, but in the end didn't care because both evenings were magical 
experiences. A few evenings ago here, it cost the equivalent of $30 to see 
Richard Harris in Luigi Pirandello's "Henry IV" and about the same to see Derek 
Jacobi in Jean-Paul Sartre's reworking of "Kean" by Alexandre Dumas pere. Those 
were orchestra seats. I spent $18 to see Alan Ayckbourn's "Man of the Moment" 
from the far reaches of the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Two out of three wasn't bad, having nothing to do with price. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and Jacobi, in plays that are both studies of illusion and reality and 
the wavery line that divides genius from madness, give the kind of all-stops, 
whispery-thundery, state-of-the-actor's-art performances that the stage is made 
for and that the customers willingly pay the price to see. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pirandello, the time is more or less now -- the civilian sane arrive in 
street dress or evening garb -- but Harris is acting out a yearslong charade as 
Henry IV of Germany, dead these many centuries. There is a throne, helmeted 
guards in attendance, though they sneak the odd cigarette when no one is 
looking. 
</P>
<P>
Is he mad, or too sane to accept the pains of the memories that go with sanity? 
Harris, imperious and childish, arms frozen in gestures of the deranged, voice 
a roar or a squeak, histrionic and then coldly, accusingly logical, is an 
astonishment. What makes the portrayal so telling is his sharp control. He may 
be the madman acting, or the sane man feigning madness, or the sane man finally 
gone mad to stay. But he is never the actor acting merely to display his gifts. 
It is a breathtaking display by an actor who has always been powerful (remember 
"This Sporting Life"?) but seldom so perfectly disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Kean (born 1787 or thereabouts, died 1833) was a legendary Shakespearean 
actor. Another legendary Shakespearean, Philip Kemble, on seeing Kean's 
Othello, was said to have said, "I did not see Mr. Kean; I saw Othello; and 
further I shall not play the part again." 
</P>
<P>
As Dumas, Sartre and Jacobi portray him, Kean is a roistering swinger in a 
tradition later to be sustained, let's say, by John Barrymore. More than in 
Barrymore, however, the line between the player and the role played, between 
the illusion and the reality, grows ever thinner, like the line between genius 
and madness, which Harris has been treading like a frayed tightrope. (There are 
pre-echoes, so to speak, of Albert Finney as the old trouper, at the end of his 
storms, in Ronald Harwood's "The Dresser.") 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Jacobi, whose Kean has been witty, dashing, grandiose, a wonderful 
roarer, is a poignant, even pathetic, confusion figure, probably mad, as Kean 
seems to have been at the end. Kemble's comment (not in the text) is cruelly 
apt; if the audience has taken Kean as Othello, then who at last is Kean, and 
does he exist? It is an existential question, as Sartre intended it to be. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a marvelous occasion of theater, with a wistful quartet (violin, 
accordion, clarinet and cornet) in clownish costumes playing the entr'actes and 
setting a tone at once mocking and melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobi, who has been so good so often, can never have displayed more of his 
reach as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
The awesomely prolific Alan Ayckbourn's latest play, "Man of the Moment," is a 
comedy upon television, and television's way of creating its own reality to 
suit its own needs, regardless of whatever the true reality of a situation may 
be. 
</P>
<P>
A ruthlessly ambitious producer is launching a series about reunions. The first 
confronts a bank robber with the teller who defied him during a robbery 17 
years earlier. The robber subsequently wrote a repenting bestseller and is now 
a TV talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
It is a dazzlingly nasty premise, not least because the robber is now a 
millionaire, vacationing in snarling opulence on Majorca, where the play takes 
place. The bank teller is still little better than a clerk, married to the 
once-beautiful woman who worked beside him in the bank and was savagely 
disfigured by the robber's shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk, who seems fatuously accepting and uncomplaining of the world as it 
is, injustices and all, was originally played by Michael Gambon ("The Singing 
Detective") and you could only wish to have seen how he handled it. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the play is nearing the end of its run; the crowd was sparse. The 
feeling was one I've had in the past when touring companies limp into Los 
Angeles from Des Moines or Grand Junction, the jokes broadened to reach the 
dimmest customer in the crowd, the subtleties of text long since swept into the 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
"Man of the Moment" builds up a certain plot tension: Surely the worm will turn 
and the vile TV man will get his comeuppance. Well, yes and no, depriving us of 
the satisfaction a farce -- which this is -- can provide. But television, and 
its self-absorption with its own technical and editorial needs, to the 
exclusion of all else, gets off almost unscathed, a worthy target hit with a 
whipped cream pie instead of an arrow. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to know whether to blame Nigel Planer, a well-regarded actor who 
followed Gambon, or the Ayckbourn text, which gives him so little chance to 
suggest the wrath beneath the wimp.

The flag atop the royal palace flew at half-staff today as Monaco mourned the 
death of Princess Caroline's husband, Stefano Casiraghi, 30, in a speedboat 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the racers competing against Casiraghi in the World Offshore 
Championships said he was driving too fast Wednesday to handle the choppy water 
on the course. His boat somersaulted backward, and he was killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the principality, but not tourists, were allowed to file past 
Casiraghi's body in a mortuary near the Princess Grace hospital. He lay in a 
simple, brass-handled mahogany coffin, still wearing the red-and-white racing 
suit in which he died while defending his world title. There was a slight cut 
under one eye.

TALES OF TORTURE IN KUWAIT; 
</P>
<P>
REFUGEES TELL OF ATROCITIES BY IRAQI SECRET POLICE FORCE 
</P>

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, the Bibi Saleh Center in downtown Kuwait city has been a haven for 
wealthy foreigners and Kuwaiti playboys and their girlfriends, a symbol of the 
oil-rich emirate's penchant for the pleasures of life. 
</P>
<P>
But in the two months since Iraq seized Kuwait, the four-towered condominium 
complex has become a cornerstone of Kuwait's brutal subjugation, according to 
reliable sources fleeing the country. 
</P>
<P>
Now, these sources say, the Bibi Saleh Center is the site of the torture 
chamber of Iraq's secret police, or Mukhabarat -- one of two tactical 
interrogation facilities widely known to be run by the feared agency. 
</P>
<P>
According to dozens of senior diplomats, businessmen and workers who have left 
Kuwait in recent weeks, the Iraqi occupiers have set out on a course of 
systematic execution, torture, disappearances and looting on a grand scale -- 
"the transplantation of an entire nation," one diplomat called it. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that at one Kuwait city hospital, the mutilated bodies of 
about 230 victims have been delivered from the complex since Iraq invaded Aug. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued earlier this week, Amnesty International, the London-based 
group that monitors human rights worldwide, condemned what it called summary 
executions and torture by Iraqi authorities in a campaign to crush the Kuwaiti 
resistance movement. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities in Baghdad flatly dismissed the Amnesty International charges 
as blatant propaganda initiated by Saudi Arabia and the West. They insisted 
that life in occupied Kuwait is "completely normal." 
</P>
<P>
But the Amnesty International report only scratched the surface, according to 
what eyewitnesses and reliable sources told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
On at least one occasion, two weeks after the invasion, the Iraqi authorities 
themselves put several of their victims on display for the benefit of foreign 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. on Aug. 16, as members of the diplomatic corps arrived at what had 
been the Iraqi Embassy in Kuwait to hear President Saddam Hussein's order to 
shut their missions, plainclothes Iraqi police paraded at least five bleeding, 
blindfolded victims past them in what some diplomats said they viewed as a 
tacit threat. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since, according to sources from Kuwait's medical community, a 
number of Kuwaiti public figures have disappeared, among them Abdul Rahman 
Smaith, head of the Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society, and the assistant director of 
the cancer center in Kuwait city. The mutilated corpses of both men were found 
a few days after the disappearances. 
</P>
<P>
The 230 bodies that have been received at Al-Rizi Hospital from the Bibi Saleh 
Center all bore evidence of torture -- "missing fingers and noses, lacerated 
ears and scorched eyeballs," as one source put it. 
</P>
<P>
All of the victims were Kuwaitis, both men and women, most of them activists 
believed to have collaborated with the Kuwaiti resistance. The resistance, 
sources say, has now been effectively neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
The torture and executions are but a small part of Iraq's overall submission 
and "requisition" campaign in Kuwait, which has now been stripped so bare that 
the entire medical system has ground to a halt and such huge items as newspaper 
printing presses, power-plant generators, brick-factory machinery, traffic 
lights, telephone poles and even computer complexes have been dismantled and 
transported to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The large-scale operation to transplant virtually all of Kuwait's vast 
resources, which the Iraqis justify by citing their official annexation of the 
emirate, is being conducted at the highest levels of the Iraqi government, with 
Cabinet ministers from Baghdad personally directing it from guest suites at 
Kuwait's Hilton Hotel, directly opposite the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Referring specifically to the accounts of torture and abuse, one diplomat in 
Baghdad who has debriefed several witnesses said, "Over a period of weeks, 
we've had a large number of anecdotal cases of arson, house destruction, 
summary execution and casual torture by Iraqi forces in Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "But these are the first confident references to the establishment by 
the Iraqi secret police of an interrogation and torture facility, which, in our 
heart of hearts, we were hoping was not there. And obviously it has been 
working for some time."

A British fighter pilot's log book recording the shooting down of "Red Baron" 
Manfred von Richthoven in World War I was sold today for $5,700. 
</P>
<P>
The auction house Christie's said a businessman in the northern English city of 
Manchester bought the log book in a telephone bid at the sale of aviation art 
and literature held at the Commonwealth Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer wanted to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The log book belonged to a friend of the late Lt. Lionel Lomas, a member of the 
flight led by Capt. Roy Brown, a Canadian, who is credited with shooting down 
the famous German ace behind British lines over the Somme battlefield on April 
21, 1918. 
</P>
<P>
The log records that on that day, 14 British Camel fighters attacked 24 enemy 
planes, shooting down three, and that Brown brought down Richthofen.

FEW REMAIN AS LAST ELDRESS OF SHAKER SECT DIES

<P>
Bertha Lindsay, the last eldress of the Shakers, a celibate religious sect that 
promoted communal living and pacifism for more than 200 years, has died. She 
was 93. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, who died Wednesday, was one of the last members of the religion that 
once boasted 6,000 members in 24 communities. One woman in her 90s remains in 
Canterbury, once home to 400 Shaker residents. Fewer than 10 live in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Able to add to their ranks only by taking in orphans or converts, Shaker 
spiritual leaders decided to halt new membership in 1965, but Lindsay often 
said the movement's beliefs would not die with the last Shakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother" Ann Lee, who brought the religion to the United States in 1774, 
prophesied that ultimately Shakers "would diminish to as many as a child could 
count on one hand, and then there would be a revival of the spirit," Lindsay 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, born July 28, 1897, in Braintree, Mass., died nearly 2 1/2 years after 
Eldress Gertrude Soule, who also lived at Shaker Village in Canterbury. 
</P>
<P>
Only 94-year-old Sister Ethel Hudson remains in the New Hampshire village. A 
small community in Sabbathday Lake, Me., includes five pre-1965 members and at 
least three admitted afterward despite the decision by Canterbury leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Shakers, formally the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second 
Appearing, gained their nickname from trembling brought on by religious fervor. 
They advocated living apart from society at large in communal villages. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone was considered equal and Shaker government offered women leadership 
roles little known in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Two eldresses and two 
elders formed the ministry that made decisions for the society. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. Orphans taken in by the 
Shakers had to decide at age 21 whether to take a vow of celibacy and remain in 
the community or leave. The day after Lindsay's 21st birthday she signed the 
Shaker covenant and donned the white starched bonnet that would identify her as 
a Shaker sister for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
When she turned 90, Lindsay lost her sight and put her energies into recording 
her life story and memories of Shaker life.

FALLING METAL BEAM MAY HAVE DAMAGED SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS

The space shuttle Atlantis may have been damaged when a 70-pound metal beam 
mistakenly left in the craft's engine room fell as the orbiter was being 
hoisted into the launch position, sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
With the shuttle Discovery on track for blastoff Saturday, Atlantis is 
scheduled for launch around Nov. 7 to ferry a military satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-billion space plane was moved from its hangar to the Vehicle Assembly 
Building earlier this week for attachment to a pair of solid-fuel boosters and 
an external fuel tank before rollout to launch pad 39A next week. 
</P>
<P>
A massive yellow sling was attached to Atlantis on Wednesday and two powerful 
overhead cranes picked the shuttle up and then rotated it into a vertical 
position so it could be bolted to its tank and boosters. 
</P>
<P>
But as the nose of the shuttle rose, engineers heard at least three distinct 
thuds apparently coming from inside Atlantis' engine compartment, according to 
the sources. 
</P>
<P>
When engineers were able to gain access to the shuttle's engine room, they 
found a yellow, nine-foot, 70-pound I-beam resting near the floor of the 
cramped compartment. 
</P>
<P>
The metal beam, apparently left inside the engine room by mistake, fell through 
the compartment as Atlantis was rotated into vertical position.

Millions of books, tapes and videos have been banned in China's current 
campaign against Western and anti-Communist influences, according to a trade 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 3 edition of the biweekly Press and Publishing Journal, seen in 
Beijing today, said: "Good results have been achieved so far." 
</P>
<P>
Since the campaign began in August last year, more than 39 million books and 
magazines and 1.6 million music and video tapes have been banned, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some 2,500 outlets (producing banned material) have been smashed," it said. 
"This has played a vital role against bourgeois liberalism and peaceful 
evolution." 
</P>
<P>
Publishing houses have increased their output of Marxist works. "All these 
books are beneficial in cleaning people's minds as to who is right and who is 
wrong and maintaining stability," the journal said.

Twenty-eight cases of St. Louis encephalitis have been confirmed in Florida in 
five weeks, forcing cancellation of night football games and other activities 
after dark, when the mosquitoes that carry the sometimes-fatal disease are most 
active. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak is the largest since 1977, when 110 cases of the disease were 
diagnosed and eight people died, health officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no fatalities have been linked to this outbreak, but two people were 
reported comatose and 13 others hospitalized, state health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 28 confirmed cases, at least seven probable cases are under 
investigation, authorities said. Florida usually records no more than three 
encephalitis cases annually.

help evacuate the aircraft if an emergency should occur. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new procedures, gate agents at each airport will assign the exit row 
seats to passengers who meet those requirements and appear able and willing to 
perform emergency functions. 
</P>
<P>
Information cards will be provided at exit row seats describing the functions 
passengers sitting there may have to perform during an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Flight attendants will describe these functions before each flight. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that 
in emergency situations, people sitting near exit doors are able to understand 
instructions in English and are able and willing to carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important safety initiative," said William Hoover, executive vice 
president of the Air Transport Assn., which represents the nation's airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Airline accidents are rare, but when they do happen it is essential that the 
people seated in exit rows are capable of hearing and understanding 
instructions, opening emergency exits and assisting their fellow passengers in 
an evacuation of the aircraft," Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA describes an exit row seat as one from which passengers may go directly 
to an exit without stepping first into an aisle.

MAYORS BELIEVE 30% JUMP IN FUEL COSTS WILL LEAD TO CUTS IN BASIC CITY SERVICES

Among the early American victims of the Persian Gulf crisis may be city 
dwellers who suffer cuts in basic services because of the sharply rising cost 
of gasoline, the U.S. Conference of Mayors said today. 
</P>
<P>
A "snapshot" survey of 50 cities found the overall cost of fuel needed to run 
police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, sanitation equipment and public 
transportation jumped 30.6% during August and in some cities -- Cleveland; 
Milwaukee; Tulsa, Okla., and Atlanta -- the rise was well over 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, for example, reported an 81.7% increase in gasoline costs in August. 
Milwaukee reported a 62% rise, Tulsa had a 57% jump and Atlanta's was 50.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles experienced a 27% jump in gasoline costs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, all but one of the 50 cities said they experienced a 
"substantial" increase in the cost of fuels in August. The only exception was 
Austin, Tex., where officials said they expected the increase to hit in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found three out of four mayors saying they believe the money to pay 
for the cost increases will come by cutting other areas of the budget. 
Officials from six cities said they will both cut services and increase local 
revenues -- meaning higher taxes.

Crystal and china group Waterford Wedgwood, hit this year by a crippling 
three-month strike and recession fears in major markets, could soon give its 
shareholders another nasty shock, analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
They forecast a six-month pretax loss of $35 million for the group, whose 
products adorn the world's luxury dinner tables, and warned that currency 
fluctuations could spell more trouble in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Nolan, equities analyst at NCB Stockbrokers, said the company's 
short-term outlook is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of share that you buy to lock away for the future. When the 
turnaround is achieved, you could see profits going up dramatically. But that 
is several years down the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group posted a pretax loss of $36 million for all of 1989. Results for the 
first half of 1990 are due to be announced this month. 
</P>
<P>
Waterford took control of the British china-maker Wedgwood in a 1986 takeover 
that united two of the most prestigious "table-top" names in the world of 
luxury goods. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, a group of investors led by Tony O'Reilly, the Irish-born chairman 
of the U.S. food giant H. J. Heinz, linked up with New York securities firm 
Morgan Stanley to take a 29.9% stake in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Just one month later, all 2,300 workers at Waterford's three crystal 
manufacturing plants walked out in the first all-out strike at the company, 
already hard hit by a slump in its crucial American and British markets. 
</P>
<P>
The strike began after workers, arguing they were scapegoats for chronic 
mismanagement, put down their tools when Waterford stopped bonus payments for 
500 glass cutters. 
</P>
<P>
John Hogan of Riada Stockbrokers estimated that the strike cost Waterford $35 
million. "There is still a problem with labor-intensive stemware. Irish labor 
costs are a third higher than those of (French crystal maker) Baccarat," he 
said.

U.S. DEMANDS GASOLINE PRODUCTION RECORDS

The Justice Department said today it has subpoenaed records of major oil 
companies, refiners and marketers as part of its investigation of gasoline 
price hikes since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The issuance of civil investigative demands for detailed records on gasoline 
production indicated that the department had stepped up its investigation of 
the price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Rill, head of the department's antitrust division, said that the 
subpoenas will enable investigators to analyze the accuracy of explanations 
given by gasoline producers and marketers for the price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The antitrust investigation began Aug. 6 following the steep rise in gasoline 
prices. Oil company officials were interviewed by Justice Department 
investigators about the price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary phase of the investigation "developed substantial information 
about the nature of crude oil and gasoline markets and how they behaved in the 
wake of the Aug. 2 invasion," Rill said in a statement. "It also provided us 
with an opportunity to have the parties explain the factors that caused them to 
raise gasoline prices." 
</P>
<P>
"We aggressively will pursue this investigation until we determine whether or 
not violations of antitrust law contributed to the rise in gasoline prices," 
Rill said. 
</P>
<P>
The average pump price of gasoline has risen 27.1 cents a gallon since the 
invasion, according to a survey issued this week by the American Automobile 
Assn.

East German unemployment shot up by 25% in September, the last month before the 
country's battered and inefficient economy was absorbed into a unified Germany, 
official statistics showed today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of jobless in what was West Germany fell to 1.73 million 
from 1.81 million in August, as companies hired more people to cope with the 
extra demand for products from the East, the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in the East, which had been officially non-existent under 
Communist rule, jumped to nearly 450,000 in September. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Office President Heinrich Francke said that the move from a planned to a 
market economy in eastern Germany meant job losses would initially exceed the 
creation of new jobs. "This painful process is unavoidable in view of the often 
low productivity of the traditional jobs and the enormous shortcomings in the 
range and quality of (East German) products under competitive conditions," he 
said.

<P>
While Cecil Fielder and George Brett captured most of the attention by winning 
home run and batting titles, respectively, a number of other landmarks were 
reached by players at the end of the major-league season. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan extended one of his many strikeout records, Vince Coleman became the 
first National League player to win six straight stolen-base titles since Maury 
Wills of the Dodgers did it from 1960-65, and Ryne Sandberg became the first 
second baseman in 65 years to win the NL home-run title. 
</P>
<P>
Brett, 37, won his third batting title, and Ryan, 43, led the American League 
in strikeouts with 232, breaking his own record as the oldest strikeout 
champion. Ryan, who has eight AL strikeout titles, led the National League in 
1987 and 1988 with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
David Cone of the Mets led the majors this year with 233. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Fielder, who hit 51 home runs, also led the majors with 132 RBIs. 
Matt Williams led the National League with 122 as the Giants became the first 
NL team with three different RBI champions in consecutive seasons. Will Clark 
won in 1988 and Kevin Mitchell in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get RBIs if there aren't guys on base, so it's a tribute to the guys 
who hit in front of and behind me," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Welch, 27-6 for Oakland, won the most games in a season since Steve Carlton 
of Philadelphia won 27 in 1972. It was the most victories in the AL since Denny 
McLain of Detroit won 31 in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek of Pittsburgh went 22-6 and became the first Pittsburgh Pirate to 
lead the NL in victories since Bob Friend tied Warren Spahn at 22 in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg's 40 home runs made him the first second baseman to win the NL home 
run title since Rogers Hornsby of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman of the Cardinals led the National League with 77 stolen bases. Rickey 
Henderson of Oakland finished with 65 steals and led the AL for the 10th time 
in 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Thigpen of the Chicago White Sox set a major league record with 57 saves, 
while John Franco of the Mets led the NL with 33. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Clemens of Boston led the majors with a 1.93 ERA, the second time he's 
won the AL title. It was the league's first ERA under 2.00 since Ron Guidry's 
1.74 for the New York Yankees in 1978. Danny Darwin of the Houston Astros led 
the NL with a 2.21 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in a non-strike season since 1972, no player in either 
league had 200 hits. The AL leader was Rafael Palmeiro with 191, and Lenny 
Dykstra and Brett Butler each had 192 in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs, with 187 hits, failed for the first time in eight years to reach 
200. 
</P>
<P>
Brett of the Royals became the first three-decade batting champion, (Story, 
C2), keeping the Oakland Athletics from finishing with two in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGee won the National League batting title with a .335 average. He was 
traded from St. Louis to Oakland on Aug. 28, but had enough at-bats to qualify 
for the NL championship. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder of Detroit won the major league home run title, connecting twice 
Wednesday night to finish with 51. (Story, C1) He became the first AL player to 
hit 50 since Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961, and the first major leaguer 
to do it since Cincinnati's George Foster in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Home runs in the major leagues increased 7.6% this season to 3,317, still well 
below the record of 4,458 set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There were 1,796 home runs hit in the American League, a 4.5% increase from the 
1,718 hit last season. National Leaguers hit 1,521 homers, an 11.4% increase 
from the 1,365 hit in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, records were set in each league. There were 2,634 home runs in the AL 
and 1,824 in the NL that season. 
</P>
<P>
After five consecutive seasons of increases, majorleague baseball attendance 
dropped one-half of 1% in 1990 to 54,871,538. 
</P>
<P>
The batting average in the NL rose 10 points this season to .256, while the AL 
batting average dropped two points to .259. 
</P>
<P>
There were only 188 balks called in the major leagues this season, less than 
half the 1989 total and just one-fifth of the record total called in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 407 balks were called in 1989 and a record 924 were called in 1988 
as umpires cracked down at the urging of then-NL president A. Bartlett 
Giamatti.

Richard M. Brown was appointed president and chief executive officer of the 
Angels today, a move that means the duties of owner Gene Autry will be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 47, has been a member of the Angels' board of directors since 1986 and 
the team's legal counsel since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
It was also announced at a news conference at Anaheim Stadium that Mike Port 
will continue full-time baseball activities as the Angels' executive vice 
president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The baseball environment has exploded within the recent past with regards to 
both technical aspects and talent, search and evaluation requirements," Port 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The new structure will enable me along with Dan O'Brien, senior vice-president 
of baseball operations, Bill Bavasi, director of minor league operations, and 
Bob Fontaine, our scouting director, to devote full attention to improving the 
Angels' on-field product." 
</P>
<P>
As president, Brown will oversee the entire operation and be responsible to 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Autry, who turned 83 last week, is a former singer and actor who has owned the 
Angels since they were formed as an American League expansion team in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"I am obviously honored by the Autrys' confidence and the position entrusted to 
me," Brown said. "My responsibilities will include a portion of the demands 
previously handled by Mr. and Mrs. Autry and a portion of the corporate 
administrative duties previously handled by Mike (Port). 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to contribute to a bright new future in Anaheim with all my energies 
directed toward this goal."

Norton was reprimanded by NHL Executive Vice-President Brian O'Neill for his

HOW ABOUT this for creative casting? Whoopi Goldberg is said to be meeting with 
the distinguished British playwright Peter Shaffer (he wrote "Amadeus," for 
instance). They will talk about Whoopi's playing what is called "the Margaret 
Tysack role" in the movie version of the Shaffer comedy "Lettice and Lovage." 
Whoopi, who was dead in the water for a minute there, is now speed-boating 
along on the raging success of her psychic self in the hit film "Ghost." It has 
already been noted here that an Academy Award nomination is in order for the 
Whoop. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, on Broadway -- just as on the London stage -- Margaret Tysack has 
had a total personal triumph acting as the exacting bureaucrat who chastises 
the eccentric and delightful fantasist Maggie Smith in this drama. But when it 
comes to the movie of same -- someone like Whoopi may whoop up the box office. 
</P>
<P>
ONE OF the nicest guys in show biz -- Barry Manilow -- has signed a long-term 
publishing agreement with BMG Music, the worldwide company of the Bertlesmann 
Music Group. Manilow produced and directed his own live stage production, 
"Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana," which opened recently at Caesars Atlantic 
City. His Christmas album, "Because It's Christmas," on Arista, will be 
released this fall. The title track is said to be an "instant classic." 
</P>

BMG also acquired Barry's catalogue of songs.

guess this is why I am no longer featured on every sixth or seventh page in 
those wonderful unflattering photos they love to buy from the paparazzi. I am 
crushed.

LINDA BLAIR RETURNS IN 'EXORCIST' SPOOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old Linda Blair achieved overnight stardom 17 years ago by spinning 
her head like a top while playing the satanically possessed child in "The 
Exorcist." 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the role in "The Exorcist II," which failed to measure up to 
the original. Thereafter, Blair swore off demonic-possession roles. 
</P>
<P>
Never again, the young actress vowed, would she allow herself to spew green 
goo, twirl her noggin and turn her eyes opaque when the devil took control of 
her body. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Blair has tripped down the primrose path a third time. She finds 
herself starring in "Repossessed," another tale of occult possession in which 
she finds herself spinning and spewing once more. 
</P>
<P>
Linda, baby. How could you? Why? Why? Why? 
</P>
<P>
A self-possessed Blair had a ready reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's a comedy," she said. "It's a spoof of all occult pictures. Now 
maybe I can get the monkey off my back." 
</P>
<P>
Blair never really recovered from her screen encounters with Beelzebub. Her 
career careened downward from there in a series of dreadful pictures, the 
result of poor career counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Blair has survived her appearances in such nuggets as "Night Patrol," 
"Roller Boogie," "Hell Night" and "Up Your Alley" -- none calculated to invite 
comparison with "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
Now, approaching 30 and wise to the ways of Hollywood agents, Blair hopes 
"Repossessed," which opened last month, will change the direction and 
complexion of her career. 
</P>
<P>
"(Director) Bob Logan talked me into doing a spoof of 'The Exorcist' because he 
knew I wanted to lay that image to rest," Blair said, curled up on a sofa in 
her Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do it until Carolco (a production company) called and asked 
me what it would take for me to do the film. Bob promised we could do it like 
'Naked Gun' and 'Airplane.' But I would agree only if they got ('Naked Gun' 
star) Leslie Nielsen for the priest. 
</P>
<P>
"They contacted Leslie, who thought the script was hilarious. He agreed to play 
the role. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a subtlety in the name of my character in 'Repossessed.' In 'The 
Exorcist,' I played Regan, right? This time, my name is Nancy. Ha! 
</P>
<P>
"And, of course, I'm not a little kid. I play a married woman with children, 
and I start having problems. My head spins around, and I throw up on my family. 
Once again I turn into a horrible, full-blooded demon, which meant hours in 
makeup every morning." 
</P>
<P>
Of her recent work in TV films and theatrical pictures, Blair is somewhat more 
than rueful. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked as an actress since I was 5," she said. "So I know about ups and 
downs in a career. For years there was no work for me in top-flight movies. 
Debra Winger would get the part when a good role turned up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I was involved with a manager who put me in touch with an agent, and neither 
of them really protected my career. I did movies that didn't give me any script 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept me working, but in what? Trash. It was the worst nightmare of my 
life. I did a topless scene in a shower in one picture. They promised they 
would shoot only from the shoulders up. I learned the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
"The critics picked on me a lot for that. Now audiences are used to seeing 
nudity and don't make a fuss about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me just say that 'Repossessed' is the biggest picture I've done for a long 
time. I feel that my 30s are going to be a lot better for my career than my 20s 
have been."

Environmentalists are working with singers Carole King and John Oates to have 
logging and mining outlawed on 13 million acres of Northwest wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
The two appeared Wednesday at a news conference to push a proposal from the 
Alliance for the Wild Rockies, based in Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
"Some environmental groups are like the unpopular kids at a high school dance 
who stand around in the corner because no one wants to dance with them," said 
Oates, of Hall &amp; Oates. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to see if I can't get someone to dance with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
King said taxpayer money should not be used to drill, build roads and clear-cut 
trees in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
"If we stopped spending federal money to destroy our public lands maybe we 
wouldn't have to raise the taxes that President Bush talked about this 
morning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance wants to ban logging, mining and road-building on public lands in 
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington.

"Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Audrey Hepburn was a successful movie in 1961, 
but these days the meal can be had for the high bid at a celebrity auction. 
</P>
<P>
For the right price, a buyer can enjoy breakfast with Hepburn at the tony 
Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds will benefit the Manhattan Center for the Living, a nonprofit 
group that assists people with life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They very sweetly contacted me and asked if I would help," Hepburn said this 
week of the auction. "It was so easy to accept. I don't have to do anything but 
come up here and have breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
The event is billed as a "Celebrity Fantasy Auction," and other big names are 
joining Hepburn. Bidders can also buy lunch with actress Candice Bergen, drinks 
with NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw or a night at Shea Stadium with Susan Sarandon 
and Tim Robbins, co-stars of the baseball film "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
The auction will take place March 4 at the Manhattan Center for the Living.

"Shogun, The Musical" is getting a new leading man. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Casnoff, last seen on Broadway as the American grand master in "Chess," 
will play the role of English sea captain John Blackthorne when the musical 
begins previews at the Marquis Theater on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Casnoff replaces Peter Karrie, who opened in the show at Washington's Kennedy 
Center last month. Karrie, who has starred in the London productions of "The 
Phantom of the Opera" and "Les Miserables," will continue playing the role for 
the rest of the Washington engagement, which ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an amicable parting," Sam Rudy, a spokesman for "Shogun," said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The lavish musical, based on James Clavell's epic novel of 17th-Century Japan, 
opens in New York on Nov. 15.

Mobster-turned-informant Henry Hill has seen "GoodFellas," the movie based on 
his life, and gives it two thumbs up for reality. 
</P>
<P>
"That movie was 99% accurate. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way we lived, that's (the way) we treated our wives, always on the 
hustle," Hill said in an interview with the syndicated television program 
"Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who appears on the show wearing a beard and sunglasses because he is in 
the witness protection program, says life has changed dramatically since he 
turned government witness and slipped into anonymity. He is remarried and has a 
new baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I can put my head on the pillow and not have to worry about a phone call in 
the middle of the night to 'come and meet me with a shovel,' " Hill said. "All 
that craziness, that insanity, is gone from my life."

The Pleasure Is Theirs 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, people were afraid to go to fancy restaurants because they 
might show their lack of manners. There's nothing to worry about these days, 
though: Top-drawer restaurants now think of etiquette as a motif, sort of like 
Polynesian Night. To announce a special menu they send their "A" list customers 
formal invitations "requesting the pleasure of your company on Friday, the 
fifth of October, Nineteen Hundred and Ninety at eight o'clock in the evening," 
with a bold note in the lower right hand corner spelling out how pleasurable 
your company is going to be: Sixty-five Dollars. 
</P>
<P>
We're not going to say anything about the restaurants that advertise 
"Complimentary Valet Parking, $2.50," because compliments are cheap. Well under 
$2.50, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Surprise in Every Package 
</P>
<P>
A company called Popcorn's Pac-N-Ship is promoting the use of popcorn as a 
cushioning material in packing. Unlike the familiar "plastic peanuts," 
proprietor Les Netterstrom points out, popcorn can be recycled as feed for 
birds and squirrels or used to mulch plants. However, a UPS spokesman observes 
that popcorn isn't a new packing material. It was widely used in the 
pre-ecology '50s but was abandoned for three reasons: It absorbs water, doesn't 
spring back when crushed, and tends to recycle itself even before delivery is 
made. The rodent and insect problems in store rooms were immense. For another 
popcorn problem, see H22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Observe the Jaws 
</P>
<P>
In a courageous move, the Red Lobster restaurant chain has become the national 
corporate sponsor of "Sharks: Fact and Fantasy," a museum exhibit consisting of 
a walk-through habitat with 17 life-size models of sharks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question No. 1: Does This Stuff Contain Caffeine? Does It? Does It? 
</P>
<P>
Celestial Seasonings, the source of all those herbal teas with tender 
philosophical sentiments printed on the package, now offers a toll-free hot 
line dispensing nutritional information and consumer tips about tea. The number 
is 1-800-544-TEAS. Call any time at all -- that's a 24-hour hot line.

Is American Food Awful? 
</P>
<P>
A group called International Research Associates recently asked consumers in 
various countries whether in their opinion Americans have good food. The people 
who were most convinced we don't were the Japanese (more than 50%, just edging 
out the French). The country that was most positive about American food turned 
out to be India, where only 5% said our food was bad, but on the other hand 60% 
of the Indians said they didn't know. Probably the only American food 
foreigners are aware of, the report notes, is fast food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Bother About Accepting Those Japanese Cards, Though 
</P>
<P>
Arby's plans to be the first fast-food chain to accept credit cards 
nation-wide. All the restaurants directly owned by the company will take 
plastic and a lot of the franchises (which account for 90% of all Arby's) are 
expected to do the same. The attraction: People spend 40%-60% more when they 
can charge it. The problem, of course, was getting credit card approval time 
(typically 20-45 seconds) up to fast-food speed (one second).

Chernobyl Milk, Sort Of 
</P>
<P>
Here's the latest: a frozen milk concentrate that can be reconstituted like 
frozen orange juice, just mix with three cups of water. Technically it's a sort 
of filled milk, with oil substituted for butterfat, but it has a fresh milk 
flavor, says inventor George Bookwalter (plus, of course, no saturated fat). 
Bookwalter originally devised it at the request of international aid officials 
helping out at Chernobyl. And they say nothing good ever comes of a nuclear 
disaster. CHARLES PERRY

BAKING: OPERATION COOKIE DELIVERS: TIPS ON WHAT TO SEND AND HOW TO SEND IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Thanks a million for the cookies. It means a lot for us to know that back home 
the people care. It was a nice surprise to receive some home cooking. Operation 
Cookie to us deployed servicemen (and women) is a complete success. Keep up the 
good work." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sgt. William Evans, U.S. Air Force 
</P>
<P>
Mail -- letters and packages -- are among the biggest morale boosters to the 
men and women involved in Operation Desert Shield, according to reports from 
the Middle East. Whether it comes from family, friends or even strangers 
doesn't matter; everything is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone willing to bake and package a batch of cookies can take part in 
Operation Cookie, a nationwide grass-roots effort to airlift cookies to the 
troops. The endeavor began when Karen Buker, of Federal Way, Wash., posted a 
request -- on a national computer bulletin board -- for cookie recipes she 
could send her son in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In response, she not only received recipes but cookies and letters from all 
across the United States. When mailing complications arose, Sylvia Mease, a 
Florida homemaker, arranged for the cookies to be shipped, space available, 
from Patrick Air Force Base. To date more than 500 boxes (weighing between one 
and 25 pounds) of cookies have been sent to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic laws are strict, so recipes should not contain alcohol. Buker also 
suggests including a note or letter. Send cookies to either Operation Cookie, 
c/o Stephen Butler, 4874 Palm Ave., La Mesa, Calif. 92041-3812, or Operation 
Cookie, c/o Sub-Trek 1, 190 Malabar Road, No. 119, Palm Bay West Center, Palm 
Bay, Fla. 32907. 
</P>
<P>
Packages personally addressed to family or friends are sent via the U.S. Postal 
Service to an APO (Army and Air Force) or FPO (Navy and Marine) box in either 
New York or San Francisco. The Army Post Office, Air Post Office or Fleet Post 
Office will handle delivery from those points. Packages may not exceed 70 
pounds or 108 inches total dimension (length and girth combined). 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army National Public Affairs Office recommends sending oatmeal, 
molasses and sugar cookies, as well as brownies. Other suggested items for 
mailing are hard candy, peanut butter, canned fruit and tuna, and unsalted 
pretzels and snacks. Basically, food that melts or contains a lot of salt 
should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting recipes, keep in mind that it takes 10 days to three weeks for 
delivery. Fruit cakes and moist quick breads will stay fresh longer and travel 
better than yeast breads. Bar cookies are a better choice than thin, or tender 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The best damage insurance during shipping is a careful job of packing. Begin by 
totally covering the item with plastic wrap, then foil. This is relatively easy 
in the case of cakes and breads. Bar cookies can be wrapped without cutting; 
delicate cookies should be individually wrapped and packed in layers, with 
cushioning between. Some items can be baked in inexpensive aluminum pans; after 
cooling, the same pans will give extra support during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
Place the items in a sturdy corrugated carton that has all the flaps intact so 
it can be securely closed. Since new cartons are not always available, used 
cartons are acceptable if checked for flaws. Be certain to carefully mark out 
all old addresses to eliminate any confusion. The carton needs to be large 
enough to hold the item or items in addition to plenty of cushioning material. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service suggests using polystyrene, excelsior or shredded 
newspaper for cushioning. Popcorn is not recommended because it can absorb 
hazardous fumes from the aircraft and become toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Cushioning should lightly overfill the container before closure. That way even 
after it settles, the item or items will be prevented from moving around during 
shipping. When several items are in the same package, they must be protected 
from each other too. 
</P>
<P>
Sturdy tape should be used to close the carton. Pressure-sensitive, 
filament-reinforced tape or reinforced paper tape 2 inches to 3 inches wide is 
recommended by the Post Office. Masking tape is not acceptable because it has a 
paper base and breaks easily. For extra strength, start the tape on the side of 
the carton adjacent to the closure. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly print the address directly on the box or a firmly affixed label. Use a 
felt tip marker or ball point pen to prevent smudging if it gets wet. Include 
the full address, including ZIP Code. 
</P>
<P>
String or twine should not be used on the outside of packages. This can get 
caught in machinery used in transporting packages to destinations.

35 minutes cake will have thick, crisp crust on top, but wood pick inserted in 
center will come out wet and covered with chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, remove cake from oven and let stand at room temperature until 
cool. Cover with rack or baking sheet and invert. Remove pan and foil lining. 
Cover with baking sheet and invert again, leaving cake right side up. 
</P>
<P>
Let cake stand 6 to 8 hours, or preferably overnight, before cutting into bars. 
Or refrigerate few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Use serrated bread knife for slicing. If ends are too dark, cut away, then cut 
cake into bars. Wipe knife blade with damp cloth after each cut. Makes 24 huge 
or 32 large brownies. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Wrap brownies individually in plastic wrap.

Interested in packing some MREs on your next camping trip? They're available 
locally at some military surplus stores, but bear this in mind: MREs are far 
from delicious. 
</P>
<P>
A hastily assembled taste panel found the freeze-dried potato particularly 
"nauseating" -- especially when consumed "as is"(without rehydrating), as the 
package suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Beans in tomato sauce were better, rather like canned vegetarian beans, and the 
beef stew was somewhat like Dinty Moore's, only grayer. After just one bite of 
turkey and gravy, comments ranged from grudging tolerance to sheer disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The sweets were a little better. A cherry nut cake that looks like something 
that has been squashed in a schoolboy's back pocket for a week has a strong 
almond flavor and is generally very sweet. The fruit mix, however, once 
rehydrated with cool water, is very close to fruit cocktail. Skip the cheese 
spread, though. 
</P>
<P>
One taster suggested that the army increase combat pay to compensate the 
soldiers for eating the "stuff." TONI TIPTON

M &amp; Ms and Charms may seem like unlikely army rations, but they are being 
served in the Saudi desert. For the 145,000 soldiers of Operation Desert 
Shield, the candy represents home. 
</P>
<P>
It is hot in the desert -- 110 to 120 degrees at midday. Sand is constantly 
blowing through the air and getting in soldiers' teeth. The days are long and 
boring. "When you have no access to anything to entertain you," says Maj. Frank 
Takacs, chief of proponency division of the Army Center of Excellence 
Subsistence, U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School, Fort Lee, Va., "food 
becomes a very big morale factor. It's the one thing the troops look forward 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Takacs says that it is the army's goal to feed everyone a cafeteria-type meal. 
"But," he says, "we don't have the facilities or the refrigeration to do so. 
T-rations and MREs fill that void." 
</P>
<P>
Tray or T-rations are meals put together from precooked, preproportioned food 
that is simply heated in boiling water, opened with a can opener and scooped 
onto plates. They are part of a new field kitchen system that eliminates the 
need for kitchen personnel and cooking from scratch. T-rations enable the 
military to feed about 200 soldiers with just a two-person crew. They are 
useful in the extreme heat of the desert where sanitation is a big concern and 
meals must be consumed very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Tray rations come in packages that feed 18 people. Containers are heated in 
huge vats of boiling water and emptied fast. The contents are served 
immediately to avoid bacteria development. Then the soldiers file past a heat 
table in the Army's Mobile Kitchen Trailer and pick up the other components of 
the meal: pound cake, bread, milk, lemon beverage powder, coffee and peanut 
butter and jelly. 
</P>
<P>
(A breakfast tray ration is a Western omelet, potatoes with bacon pieces, 
peaches, apple-cinnamon oatmeal, bread, milk, orange juice, coffee and cocoa.) 
</P>
<P>
Meals Ready-To-Eat (MREs) are another matter. Like T-rations, MREs are 
precooked and prepackaged. But these sealed, flexible bundles of aluminum and 
plastic are individual servings that replace the canned C-rations that were 
once served to this country's rank and file. They contain entrees ranging from 
beef stew to tuna and noodles. 
</P>
<P>
MREs are lightweight, fit into a soldier's pack and are easy to use when on 
patrol. The food doesn't even need to be heated. The soldiers simply tear off 
the sealed edge and dig in with a plastic spoon (part of the kit). These 
shelf-stable meals -- each lasts up to 36 months -- are the result of years of 
research and evaluation. They make up at least one-third of the meals being 
consumed by American troops in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of testing has gone into the current MREs," Takacs said. "Sensory 
evaluations were conducted by the soldiers so they could tell us what they 
like. (Their likes include name-brand candy, hot sauce and Kool-Aid. The Army 
also discovered that the soldiers prefer Tasters' Choice to regular dehydrated 
coffee and precooked meats to freeze-dried.) 
</P>
<P>
But MREs aren't just a better tasting luxury. They are a necessity for 
survival, explains Harvey Keene, of the U.S. Army Natick Research and 
Development Center, the branch that developed them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always looking for ways to make subsistence items lighter because a 
soldier can only carry so much weight. He's hauling ammunition and food, and on 
extended patrol, every ounce or pound that you take off a subsistence load or 
equipment load translates into a greater combat load. He can carry another 
grenade, another clip of ammunition -- something that allows him to survive in 
a firefight." 
</P>
<P>
However, the soldiers are not always off in the field eating food from pouches. 
When they are not on patrol they eat in mess halls that have been set up 
throughout the Arabian desert. And in the best of times they are eating a 
"cafeteria-type meal" of fresh food supplied by independent Saudi food service 
providers. Even when the mess hall is forced to serve T-rations or MREs, the 
meals are supplemented with fresh fruit, vegetables and milk. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sort of in a business like any other company," says Takacs. "We're 
trying to make sure that the customer is satisfied. It's a continuous process."

CHEF'S SECRETS: BREAKFAST IN A TORTILLA

<TEXT>
<P>
Dinora Guzman is a mobile truck cook, catering mostly to hungry workers from 
the garment district buildings in the Downtown area. During the morning, a lot 
of the early risers can be seen eating Guzman's machaca burritos. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman's method for preparing machaca is to season diced round steak with 
mustard and cook it with a sprinkling of Worcestershire -- Guzman calls it 
"black sauce." The eggs are scrambled with sauteed onions, green pepper and 
tomato mixed with the meat, then wrapped in a tortilla; sometimes a topping of 
beans is added. 
</P>
<P>
You can duplicate the machaca at home for a breakfast party. Arrange the 
filling, tortillas and toppings -- beans, sour cream, cilantro and hot sauce -- 
separately on a table, and allow each guest to created his or her own machaca 
burrito. It's a complete breakfast in a tortilla. 
</P>
<P>

BACK TO BASICS: HOW TO STUFF A PORK CHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent survey by National Family Opinion, Inc., a consumer research 
organization, reported 93% of the 1,304 consumers polled believed that pork 
must be cooked well done to be wholesome. Apparently this conviction is based 
on the age-old fear that eating undercooked pork causes the illness 
trichinosis. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Pork Producers Council, concern over becoming 
infected with this disease from eating pork is no longer justified. Even if 
present, trichinae is killed at 137 degrees, well below the doneness 
recommended for pork. 
</P>
<P>
Today's modern feeding practices are producing pork that is 50% leaner than the 
meat available 20 years ago. "In the past it was possible to overcook pork and 
still have a fairly tender product with good flavor," says Robin Kline, a 
registered dietitian, NPPC director of consumer affairs. "However, that's not 
the case today." 
</P>
<P>
The council now recommends cooking pork to 160 degrees, or medium, in order to 
retain more of the meat's natural juices and tenderness. For many pork cuts, 
this means it is properly cooked when still slightly pink at the center. A meat 
thermometer will ensure the meat is cooked to the proper temperature and is 
especially easy to use in larger cuts such as roasts and stuffed pork chops. 
</P>
<P>
When purchasing pork chops for stuffing, select those that are double-cut, 
about an inch thick. Use a sharp paring knife to trim any fat in excess of 
1/4-inch from the edge of the chops. Then make a horizontal slit 1 1/2 to 2 
inches long through the fat. Insert the knife into the slit and draw it from 
side to side to form a pocket (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
Lightly spoon about 1/4 cup stuffing into the pocket of each pork chop (Step 
2). Securely close the pocket opening by inserting two wood picks (Step 3). 
Snip off the picks level with the surface (Step 4) before browning the chops on 
both sides in a small amount of oil (Step 5). 
</P>
<P>
Add enough chicken broth to the pan (Step 6) to prevent the chops from 
sticking. Reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer the chops 30 minutes or 
until tender and the desired degree of doneness, adding more broth as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the chops and keep warm. Dissolve a tablespoon of cornstarch with a 
small amount of water and add to the remaining pan juices. Cook, stirring, 
until thickened. Serve the sauce over the chops. 
</P>
<P>
STUFFED PORK CHOPS 
</P>
<P>
1 cup stale bread cubes 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon fresh chopped sage 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
6 pork chops, cut about 1 inch thick 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth, about 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
Combine bread cubes, celery, onion, thyme, sage and salt and pepper to taste. 
Moisten mixture with milk. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Use sharp paring knife to trim any fat in excess of 1/4-inch from edge of 
chops. Cut horizontal slit 1 1/2 to 2 inches long through fat, then insert 
knife into slit and draw from side to side to form pocket. Repeat for each 
chop. 
</P>
<P>
Lightly spoon about 1/4 cup stuffing into pocket of each pork chop. Securely 
close pocket opening by inserting 2 wood picks. Snip off picks level with 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Saute chops in oil over medium heat until browned on both sides. Add enough 
broth to keep chops from sticking, reduce heat, cover and simmer 30 minutes, 
adding more broth as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Remove chops and keep warm. Dissolve cornstarch in small amount of water. Stir 
into pan juices and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Serve over 
chops. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Remove wood picks before serving.

ABOUT WINE: CASTELLO D'ALBOLA: BREAKING TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
RADDA IN CHIANTI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wine of Chianti -- red, dry and in the midst of a renaissance -- is 
composed as much of heritage and history as of wine-making expertise, so it is 
noteworthy when a winery defies tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the parched, rocky hills of the Chianti country, it is not easy to make 
changes. Zoning laws all but prohibit expansion of buildings; Common Market 
laws all but prohibit new plantings. Cost factors override everything, making 
renovation a practical impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
Money, however, can help. Two of Italy's most successful modern wine producers, 
Villa Banfi and Antinori, got where they are today because they had always been 
money makers, which permitted those two far-thinking companies to reinvest 
their profits and improve their wines. 
</P>
<P>
Castello d'Albola is also a product of profit reinvestment. Unlike Banfi and 
Antinori, Albola has not yet won wide fame, but its new wines are indicative of 
two truisms of Chianti: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The old methods that focus on excellent grapes still make great wine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Modern techniques of farming, fermenting and finishing can combine with the 
older methods to make wine greater than anything yet seen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is one absolute that binds these two thoughts: To do anything 
right here requires money, preferably a load of it. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th-Century watchtower atop the main building at Castello d'Albola 
indicates that this place -- once known as Pian d'Albola -- has been making 
wine for centuries. But it is only during the last two years that it has been 
making great wine. 
</P>
<P>
The funding behind the renovation of Albola comes from the huge Italian wine 
firm Zonin, which bought a decaying 1,200-acre estate here in 1979 and 
immediately began upgrading the whole operation, from restoring the vineyards 
to building a massive new wine-making facility. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a great amount of deterioration of the vines during the time when 
they were not properly tended," said Bruno Zaratin, director. He pointed out 
that because of the large number of vines per acre in the densely planted, 
steeply sloped Albola vineyard, it cost about $20,000 per acre to replant the 
vines (about five times the cost of a valley floor vineyard in California). 
There are about 375 acres of vines here, a costly replanting job for at least 
one other reason: labor here is scarce and thus expensive. 
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note, though, that approaching this facility from Radda, 
one must leave the paved road and drive more than a mile on an unpaved 
rock-strewn path to the ancient walled castle. In other words, though Zonin was 
prepared to spend millions on the vineyards to produce quality wine, paving the 
road was clearly viewed as a frill. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation of this property includes a monstrous, 80,000 square-foot 
winery, modern in every respect including the design. Getting this structure 
approved required the patience and cash to fight bureaucratic intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
"How long did it take you to get the permits for this place?" I asked Zaratin 
as we walked around the $3 million structure, still uncompleted. 
</P>
<P>
"Only four years!" he exclaimed in exultation. "Not many people can get permits 
that quickly here. This is one of the most protected places in all of Italy." 
Then he added quickly: "And then three months after we got the final permit, 
the law was changed again, so now it's even harder to get a permit." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, two things occurred to make Albola a true property of potential. The 
first was when the winery placed Filippo Pedron in charge of vineyard and 
winery operations. A talented wine maker, Pedron was charged with making only 
great wine and selling off anything not satisfying that mandate. 
</P>
<P>
Then Zonin entered into an international marketing agreement with the Seagram 
Classics Wine Co., a powerhouse in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Driving around the estate with Pedron and Zaratin, I saw touches of care 
everywhere: matching the grape variety to a particular soil, careful choice of 
clone (13 different clones of Sangiovese are used here), concern over sun 
exposure for a type of pruning system, even the location of the new olive 
trees. (Making olive oil is as much a Chianti tradition as making wine.) 
</P>
<P>
Tasting the latest releases, I was quite impressed with the wines, the 1988s 
and 1989s even more than the excellent 1987s, evidence that Pedron has had an 
immediate impact on the quality. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Chianti Classic ($7) is an excellent, balanced and fruity red wine 
with a bone-dry finish, perfect for pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Utterly sublime, however, was the 1988 Chianti Classico ($9), which will be 
released in two months. A flowery aroma and soft cherry-raspberry notes make it 
appealing, and the aftertaste is a joy because of lower tannins and an 
extremely long finish. 
</P>
<P>
Pedron said he made the wine with new rototanks that gently roll the juice and 
the skins around together, extracting proper flavors without excessive tannins. 
It's a method used with great success by the Australian wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
This is a striking wine, one of such immense appeal that it was declared the 
winner of the Douja d'Or for 1990 -- the highest award in a wine competition of 
849 wines from throughout Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Albola also has two newer-styled Tuscan wines. Both are marvelous, if a bit 
pricey. The better of the two is 1988 Accaiolo, a soft, very rich, toasty red 
wine with a marvelous cherry-nutmeg spice quality and an intense, deep 
aftertaste. At $26, it sounds expensive, but it may become one of the cult 
wines of the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
A companion wine, 1989 Castello D'Albola Chardonnay ($21), is also superb, 
mainly because of its lean, fresh aroma, creamy mid-palate and fruity finish. 
It is excellent wine and competes with the best Chardonnays of the New World. 
</P>
<P>
However, with its 1987 and 1988 Chianti Classico wines, Castello d'Albola will 
make its mark in a more obvious way: great red wines at a price most people can 
afford.

HAVING THEIR CAKE

The article and recipe for the "secret-ingredient cake" was interesting. But 
it's still a very high-fat and high-calorie dessert. I believe it might be 
possible to make a very good-tasting, low-calorie, low-fat cake with these 
revisions: 
</P>
<P>
Instead of 3 eggs, use 6 egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the sugar amount from 1 3/4 cups to 1 1/2 cups. Instead of using 1 1/4 cups 
of oil, use 1 1/4 cups of applesauce. Delete the 1 1/4 teaspoons of salt from 
the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
I've analyzed both recipe versions with Nutritionist III software. You'll note 
that the calories are reduced by 53% (283 to 133 calories), and cholesterol is 
eliminated completely. Only a tenth of a serving/exchange of vegetables (3 
calories) results from the addition of the beans -- I'd be tempted to sneak in 
double that amount at least.

U.S. CAUTIOUS ON HEART VALVE IMPLANT TESTER

A device may be able to identify mechanical heart valves in danger of failing, 
a study showed Wednesday, but the government wants more tests before it is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
In the study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, developers of the 
Valve-Tracker Two said their computerized device may offer a way to detect 
recipients of Bjork-Shiley heart valves that are at high risk of failure. 
</P>
<P>
About 86,000 people were implanted with the Bjork-Shiley "convexo-concave" 
heart valve, which was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1986 -- five 
years after the first reports of life-threatening valve fractures surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people worldwide still have the valves in their chests, 
including about 20,000 in the United States. At least 250 people have died of 
fractured valves, although consumer groups estimate the toll may be as high as 
750 because not all the deaths have been reported to officials. 
</P>
<P>
The valve was manufactured by Irvine-based Shiley Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer 
Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, no methods are available to doctors to test valve recipients to see 
if their valves have a closure pattern that Pfizer engineers say causes the 
devices to fail. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has refused to approve a request by Gerald 
Kien, of Barrington, Ill., developer of the Valve-Tracker Two, to market his 
device for screening patients with potentially defective Bjork-Shiley valves, 
FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency wanted Kien to conduct further tests on patients to prove that the 
device, which uses a sensitive microphone to record the valve's sound pattern, 
is an accurate predictor of valve failure.
