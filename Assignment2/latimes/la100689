NEWSMAKERS: BATHROOM'S MESSY, SO IRAQI GOVERNOR GETS SWEPT OUT

Iraq's President Saddam Hussein isn't above airing a little dirty laundry in an 
effort to clean up his government. While on a visit to the district governor of 
Darbandikhan, 180 miles northeast of Baghdad, Hussein was shocked at finding a 
filthy bathroom and linens in the governor's office and promptly fired him. "If 
the governor himself is not clean and tidy, how will we manage to raise the 
standard of our people?" Hussein said on television as he inspected the 
official quarters of Mustafa Fatah. Television viewers heard Hussein angrily 
rebuke Fatah over the facility's untidy state and dirty towels, and heard him 
declare that the government would fire any governor who failed to look after 
his district's hygiene. A decree was later issued by the ruling Revolutionary 
Command Council confirming Fatah's early retirement and demotion to a lower 
grade pension.

 -- A lawsuit filed by Armand Hammer wants to stop an unauthorized biography, 
but the author is betting the suit will only stimulate sales. "Armand Hammer: 
The Untold Story" was written by University of Missouri journalism professor 
Steve Weinberg, who says he interviewed nearly 700 people but got no 
cooperation from the 91-year-old chairman of Occidental Petroleum Co. Weinberg 
says the book, published by Little Brown, is already on bookstore shelves. He 
predicts that Hammer's efforts, currently directed at stopping publication of 
the book in Europe, may actually stir interest in the biography. Letters from 
Hammer's lawyers, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, described the book as 
"beyond redemption by correction" and "riddled" with falsehoods. But Weinberg 
says he uncovered new information questioning Hammer's clout in Washington and 
detailing a questionable bankruptcy filing by Hammer's father.

DEL WOOD; GRAND OLE OPRY'S RAGTIME PIANIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Del Wood, 69, the Grand Ole Opry's ragtime pianist whose 1951 recording of 
"Down Yonder" sold more than 3 million copies. Miss Wood became a member of the 
Opry in 1953 and was the only person regularly featured at the Grand Ole Opry 
keyboard. Known as "The Queen of the Ivories," her real name was Adelaide 
Hazelwood. In an interview with the Associated Press in 1984, she said she 
still practiced about three hours a week. "I'd never go on the Opry without 
first doing a run-through. If I live to be 100, I'm going to do the best I 
can," she said. Miss Wood's parents gave her a piano on her fifth birthday, and 
she was schooled in classical music until ragtime -- a jazz-influenced style of 
pop music -- became her passion as a teen-ager. "Ragtime has so much 
get-up-and-go that it's infectious; it's part of our heritage," she said. She 
cut a record featuring "Mine All Mine" for RCA, with "Down Yonder" on the flip 
side. "Down Yonder" was second on the pop charts for 27 weeks and was also a 
country hit. Miss Wood also played in the movie "Rhinestone," which starred 
Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone. In Nashville on Tuesday after a stroke.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THIS RUN FOR THE BORDER TURNS OUT TO BE A GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've read about it in the newspapers. You've seen it on the television news. 
If you live in the North County, maybe you've attended a dozen or so community 
meetings to shout at your neighbors about it. 
</P>
<P>
And now there is a board game about it: Run for the Border, which describes the 
desperate trek of illegal aliens toward Los Angeles, and the cat-and-mouse 
contest between aliens and the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Run for the Border is the brainchild of Roland Fisher, Jose Mata and Frank 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who hope to both make a buck and sensitize the game-playing public 
to the plight of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 29, is a former Border Patrol officer in El Centro and now works at 
Rohr Industries in Chula Vista. Mata, 30, is a nursing assistant, and 
Rodriguez, 28, runs an urgent-care center and teaches martial arts; both live 
in El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. border is easily penetrated, not so the big-time game market. The 
three friends have formed their own company, Gametime Inc., to handle 
production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the game is available (at $19.95) in video stores in El Centro, Brawley 
and Calexico, and soon, a video store in El Cajon. More later, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Run for the Border is a Monopoly derivative, with dice and small markers, good 
cards (Coyote Cards) and bad cards (Risk Cards), and Borderbucks. The goal is 
to get to L.A., avoiding deportation, unscrupulous smugglers and assorted 
rip-off artists. 
</P>
<P>
"People laugh at illegal aliens, but they've got no idea how difficult and 
frustrating their lives are," Rodriguez said. "Our game is more than just fun, 
it makes a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Foolishness 
</P>
<P>
I don't make 'em up, honest: 
</P>
<P>
* Letter from a La Mesa man to the (El Cajon) Californian newspaper: 
</P>
<P>
"Would some pro-life proponent please tell me if a woman who just had a 
successful intercourse should be allowed to drive in the diamond lane on the 
freeway?" 
</P>
<P>
* Tufts University this week shelved its "fighting words" disciplinary code for 
students because of First Amendment problems. A similar code at the University 
of Michigan was overturned in court.The University of California refuses to 
budge. 
</P>
<P>
* Calling all Caterpillars. The Building Industry Assn., which is backing a 
drive to help challenger Bob Trettin in the 1st District, is making a similar 
effort to save Councilman Ed Struiksma in the 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
* Reporters are giggling over Kirby Bowser, the Lakeside accountant who got but 
48 votes in the 76th Assembly District race. That's bad, but others have done 
worse, much worse. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hague, a retired newsman (Associated Press/Washington Post) living in 
Rancho Bernardo, remembers a Maryland gubernatorial candidate in the 1940s, 
Stephen B. Peddicord. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-campaign, Peddicord stopped believing his own speeches and instead 
started telling everyone that the best candidate was the incumbent, Romulus 
O'Conor. 
</P>
<P>
Voters believed him. O'Conor was reelected, and Peddicord got zero (0) votes. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev on TV? Nyet 
</P>
<P>
If you missed his face in the curriculum guide to the Soviet arts festival, 
Mikhail Gorbachev look-alike Ronald Knapp will be on the "Tonight Show" with 
Johnny Carson on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
He's also angling for a cover story in Mad magazine (no joke). He's done a rock 
video, an interview with Izvestia, and a television commercial for a Boston 
appliance store. T-shirts are a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, 51, a Canadian-born Iroquois-Seneca Indian now living in Huntington 
Beach, enjoys the confusion. He doesn't even mind losing several layers of skin 
every time he uses nail polish to apply Gorby's distinctive birthmark on his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
He says the mix-up in the curriculum guide reaffirms a lesson he learned when 
he started selling real estate: "Things are often not what they seem."

DOCTORS' LIABILITY FOR PATIENTS' ACCIDENTS AT STAKE IN LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A potentially far-reaching lawsuit that asks just how accountable a doctor 
should be when an epileptic patient gets behind the wheel of a car is set to 
close today in El Cajon Superior Court with the last of the lawyers' final 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The suit stems from a head-on, two-car crash in August, 1983, on Coronado's 
Silver Strand Boulevard. An 18-year-old epileptic, Trudy Stevenson, lost 
control of her 1977 Mustang and ripped across the median into oncoming traffic, 
killing a 90-year-old retired Navy captain and injuring three people. 
</P>
<P>
The key factual question for the jury, which is expected to get the case late 
today, is whether Stevenson suffered an epileptic seizure that led to the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying issue, however, is whether her East County neurologist, Mark C. 
Levine, is liable for damages to Stevenson's passenger and friend, Sherril 
Altstadt, whose spinal cord was cut in the crash, leaving her a paraplegic. She 
frequently attended the six weeks of trial in her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closely Watched Case 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and lawyers who specialize in medical malpractice issues have watched 
the case closely. If the jury returns a verdict against Levine, physicians fear 
a flood of expensive cases and a greatly diminished incentive to assist 
epileptics -- and those with other disorders that may lead to blackouts, such 
as heart disease and alcoholism -- gain a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are required under state law to report immediately to county health 
officers all disorders involving "lapses of consciousness." That information 
must be passed on to the Department of Motor Vehicles, the law says. 
</P>
<P>
Under that law, a verdict against Levine would mean "epileptics and others in a 
similar class will not be able to drive, period," said Robert W. Harrison, 
Levine's San Diego lawyer. "Because (doctors) are going to report them all as 
unsafe, to cover their rear ends, or they'll refuse to see that class of 
patients." 
</P>
<P>
Altstadt's attorney, Patrick Frega of San Diego, said the case has already had 
an impact. Since trial began in late August, he said: "The doctors have been 
reporting everything, even things they don't need to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Economic Oath That Matters' 
</P>
<P>
"I would think the Hippocratic oath would have some impact," Frega said. "But I 
think it's the economic oath that matters, that (doctors) are going to get hurt 
in their pocketbooks." 
</P>
<P>
The case was filed in August, 1984, and in El Cajon because Altstadt, then 
known by her maiden name, Sherril Romero, used to live in nearby Santee. She 
sued both Levine and Stevenson, alleging negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV issued Stevenson a probationary license in April, 1981, with conditions 
that required her to report "adverse changes" in her condition. That license 
was issued after a report Levine filed in March, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 12, 1983, Stevenson was hospitalized with recurring seizures. In 
arguments Thursday, Frega contended she had at least 12 that day alone. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, Frega said, was required to report that "adverse change" by Jan. 25, or 
10 days after Stevenson was released from the hospital, but failed to do so. 
That June, Levine told Stevenson she could drive, but only in emergencies or to 
work, Frega said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Aug. 28, two months after that. 
</P>
<P>
Frega, who planned to resume arguments today, said he intends to ask the jury 
to award $4.7 million in damages to Altstadt, who now lives in Newbury Park, a 
Ventura County suburb of Los Angeles. Now 25, she said Thursday that she is 
studying to become an interpreter for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who will follow Frega to the lectern, said he plans to tell the jury 
that the accident was not caused by a seizure. Further, Stevenson "never lost 
consciousness" during any seizure, so the law -- which applies to "lapses of 
consciousness" -- did not apply directly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the January, 1983, seizures, they were not any worse than any that had 
come before but only more frequent, so not an "adverse change," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, Harrison said, Levine faithfully followed all reporting 
requirements. "I don't believe there's any evidence that holds water as to 
negligence," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Altstadt has settled her claims against Stevenson, said Stevenson's attorney, 
Jim Badger.

Two Lakeside residents were killed Thursday in Nebraska when their motor home 
collided with a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 80, about 50 miles west of 
Lincoln, Nebraska officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the dead as Robert Warczak, 63, and his wife, Gladys, 
who lived in the 9000 block of Harritt Road. The couple died at the scene of 
the 2 a.m. accident, said Carol Gocke of the York County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gocke said the truck, which was traveling east on I-80, struck a disabled 
vehicle pulling a horse trailer. The large truck then crossed the highway and 
crashed, blocking the westbound lanes. It was then struck by the Warczaks' 
motor home. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck was also killed in the collision, as were four horses, 
Gocke said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers in the vehicle with the horse trailer suffered minor injuries, she 
said.

There was no need to remind Domino's downtown delivery force that Southern 
Californians were supposed to stay out of their cars Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the shop's 20 intrepid pizza porters have operated exclusively 
on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just too many traffic and parking problems using cars," said 
supervisor Mario Betancourt. "We tried having them just drive at night when 
there was less traffic, but even that wasn't as effective as delivering on 
bikes." 
</P>
<P>
The pizza pedalers still must adhere to Domino's guarantee that the order will 
be delivered within 30 minutes, or $3 will be docked from the price. But 
there's a catch. The messengers will only venture six blocks from the ovens at 
545 S. Olive St. (a fitting location for a pizza shop). 
</P>
<P>
There are dangers even in that limited area, though. 
</P>
<P>
"We give our people locks, now," Betancourt said. "Some of them have had their 
bikes stolen." 
</P>
<P>
At least when you get stuck in an elevator, you have a bit of privacy. Not so 
the unfortunate woman who was caught inside a revolving glass door Thursday 
morning at Bunker Hill's California Plaza. The door malfunctioned, according to 
witnesses. Plaza officials had no comment on the matter. The woman was trapped 
about half an hour at the entrance to the (otherwise) futuristic office tower 
until workers freed her by removing some of the door's panels.

Some Wilshire residents have objected to the proposal of Los Angeles school 
authorities to build an "Ambassador" high school. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Wilshire Stakeholders would rather have the bankrupt Ambassador 
Hotel converted into a development. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps it's all a misunderstanding, and residents and school officials 
aren't really at odds. 
</P>
<P>
As the Stakeholders' Bruce Dworshak points out, there is a second proposed site 
that his group finds more preferable. 
</P>
<P>
It's a few blocks north of the Ambassador Hotel. One of the businesses 
currently occupying this site is the Ambassador Dog &amp; Cat Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Editor: I am compelled to bring to your attention an example of literary 
desecration that occurred recently in the 'Only in L.A.' column," begins a 
friendly note from Stephen Pastorkovich of Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The same desecration also prompted a faxed message from Sam Gamgee of Santa 
Barbara, who no doubt wanted the error corrected as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Here it is: In discussing a Los Angeles street sign with the tongue-twisting 
name of "111st St.," we speculated that the sign painter was inspired by Frodo 
Baggins, who celebrates his "eleventy-first" birthday in Tolkien's "Lord of the 
Rings." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, as Pastorkovich and Gamgee point out, Frodo does no such thing. It's his 
cousin, Bilbo Baggins, who hits that milestone. (Of course -- Bilbo!) 
</P>
<P>
Eleventy-one slashes for your columnist.

LEBANON'S PEACE AND ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is an old joke that is quite pertinent to the column on Lebanon. The joke 
has to do with the lack of logic in anti-Semitism: A Nazi asks, "Do you know 
who is responsible for all the misery in the world?" "Sure," says the other 
man. "It is the Jews and the bicycle riders!" The Nazi is perplexed. "What do 
the bicycle riders have to do with it?" he says. "Well, what do the Jews have 
to do with it?" says the other. 
</P>
<P>
The column on the Lebanon situation would be almost funny if it weren't so sad. 
The writer blames the slaughter in Lebanon on Israel and its occupation of "the 
southern part of the country." Really? Is he sure that it isn't Israel and the 
bicycle riders? The shells that kill civilians in Beirut are not fired by 
Israelis; the army that occupies and governs most of the country is Syrian, not 
Israeli, and the thousands of refugees -- many of whom have found safety in the 
10-mile strip of land along the Israeli border -- have not been made homeless 
by Israel.

In response to Saleh's column, I feel that it is about time that someone 
finally realizes something must be done. If you scrutinize the situation in 
Lebanon, you realize how excruciating life is there. I think it is an 
effrontery for a country as prodigious as the United States to remain 
uninvolved at such a time. Lebanon's survival relies on outside help. If we 
consider ourselves wealthy, why are we not sharing our resources with Lebanon? 
If we spend billions on nuclear weapons, why can't we give to those in need 
instead? Is it not about time we put our tax money to good use?

'STAR WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last number of years, the United States and Soviet Union were at 
loggerheads over the issue of "Star Wars." The Russians thick-headedly insisted 
upon the relinquishment of the "Star Wars" project as a precondition to arms 
reduction. The United States stood up to this demand and steadfastly refused to 
be forced into its abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians have finally seen the light and they no longer insist upon the 
elimination of "Star Wars" as a precondition. But now we hear from Washington 
that "Star Wars" is not worth a tinker's damn in the first place, and we 
couldn't afford it if it was worth anything in the second place. 
</P>
<P>
My question is: Did something get lost in translation for the last five years? 
Alice, please come back from Wonderland; we need you.

SAD IMMIGRATION PARADOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long lines of people seeking immigration applications at the U.S. Embassy 
in Moscow testify to the Soviet Union's new readiness to allow its citizens 
greater freedom of movement, and to the eagerness of so many of them to leave 
while the political climate allows it. Most of those waiting, however, are 
destined to be disappointed. Of the 300,000 Soviet citizens who are expected to 
apply for U.S. entry visas in the coming year, no more than 80,000 will get 
them. 
</P>
<P>
After years of U.S. pressure, the Soviets have finally dropped many of their 
barriers to emigration. But the United States at the same time has been forced 
to erect barriers of its own to control a prospective flood of arrivals. A U.S. 
diplomat describes the situation as a moral quandary. To those most affected, 
it is a human calamity. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Soviet immigrants to be admitted in the coming year will be 
given refugee status if they have close relatives in the United States and if 
they are found to be victims of persecution. These persons are eligible for up 
to $7,000 in resettlement aid. As many as 30,000 more applicants who have 
relatives in the United States but who aren't considered by Washington to be 
facing persecution will be admitted as parolees. They will have permission to 
live and work in the country, but they won't be entitled to federal help. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves several hundred thousand more would-be emigrants with no hope of 
gaining U.S. entry visas. Many of these people are Jews, Armenians, 
Pentecostals. Most argue that they face abuse or persecution for what they are 
or for what they believe. On the official level, they say, abuse has diminished 
but on a social level it is worse because of increasing popular outbursts of 
ethnic and religious bigotry. In a country that has a dark and bloody history 
of pogroms and that faces growing outbreaks of intercommunal strife, those 
fears aren't to be scorned. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unreasonable to accuse the United States of being uncaring in the 
matter of Soviet immigration. Accepting 80,000 Soviet citizens in the coming 
year on top of 50,000 who arrived in the last year speaks for a humane and 
generous policy. The ceiling on Soviet immigration seems to be strictly 
cost-dictated. Only so much money is available to cover the expenses of refugee 
resettlement, and the Soviet Union is only one of a number of countries from 
which the threatened and the persecuted will be arriving. Equity demands that 
the needs of other immigrants be considered. 
</P>
<P>
What can be done? U.S. officials say that other Western countries must do their 
fair share to welcome Soviet emigrants, and within their absorption capacity 
some others are. Israel actively encourages migration by Soviet Jews, though so 
far only a small number of those who have been able to leave the Soviet Union 
have chosen to settle there. The prospect of mass immigration to Israel, 
however, raises a fresh question of how resettlement would be paid for. Israel 
has already said it will need hundreds of millions of dollars in help to 
provide for a wave of Soviet immigration. If the United States has trouble 
finding money to settle more Soviet refugees here, it seems unlikely it will 
find the money to settle them in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The tighter U.S. policy on Soviet immigration is understandable, but it remains 
disturbing nonetheless. Long years of agitation for freer Soviet emigration 
have at last paid off, but the budgetary costs of victory are now seen as 
prohibitive. With luck, perhaps many among the hundreds of thousands of Soviet 
applicants who can't get into the United States will find new homes elsewhere. 
What still has to be asked is why American policy planners failed to adequately 
consider what would happen if one day the Soviets did as they were bid on 
emigration. Had there been more forethought and better planning, perhaps the 
lines at the Moscow Embassy that the U.S. government now points to as a sign of 
political success wouldn't also have the discomfiting look of a major moral 
embarrassment.

WHY JOHNNY AND SALLY CAN'T RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAIL WELDON, Gail Weldon, director of physical therapy and athletic training 
for the 1984 Olympics, is director of the private Fitness Training Room and 
Conditioning Center (TRACC) in Los Angeles. She recently returned from the 
World Cup Track and Field Meet in Barcelona, where she was head trainer for the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our children are in terrible physical shape. Recent news accounts about a study 
of more than 10,000 students, age 6 through 17, demonstrate just how terrible. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Amateur Athletic Union, found that our children 
have little heart or lung endurance, absurdly limited muscle flexibility, no 
muscle tone to speak of and weigh far too much. Nearly half the students 
studied could not even reach a "satisfactory" level of performance while doing 
sit-ups, running or stretching. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, our children have grown heavier, slower, weaker and, most 
significantly, less healthy. Like all educational problems, the trend toward 
unfitness points to a bleak future, one in which health-care costs will grow 
even more monstrous than they are now. 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to trace the path that led our children to this dangerously 
unfit state. First and foremost, they don't move much. Barely one-third of our 
children are required to take part in any daily exercise at school. That is the 
result of many factors: We place far too much emphasis on competitive 
athletics; education budgets have grown smaller; video games have replaced 
active games. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons for the decline in required exercise, it is time to 
reverse the trend and require every student to take part in a fitness program. 
And this time, we should do it right. 
</P>
<P>
My staff and I have been fortunate to work with many very gifted student 
athletes who want to compete and happily work to develop their gifts. When we 
visit school health fairs, however, we see the rest of the student population 
-- children who are horribly out of shape, ill informed and under-motivated. It 
is heartbreaking. Worse, it is a waste of the children themselves, who ought to 
be learning to use their bodies skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
To make these children fit, and to motivate them, we must change our view of 
physical education. It must become fitness education, in which everyone 
participates, nutrition is part of the course and competition is the least 
important value. No child should endure the pain and anxiety of being the "last 
one picked," because in a program dedicated to fitness and health, everyone 
gets picked and everyone participates. 
</P>
<P>
There is no excuse for denying our children this opportunity. No school system 
is so poor that it cannot organize, at minimum, a 20-minute walking test for 
every student every day. When that walk begins to produce stronger hearts and 
lungs, there are very inexpensive ways to bring the muscles up to par, too. 
Bags of rice make excellent training weights, two kids at each end of a strong 
rope can create a balanced isometric exercise, and push-ups and sit-ups don't 
require any equipment at all. Parents can support the program by learning more 
from booklets, from groups such as the AAU and from the President's Council on 
Physical Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
School leaders must help, too. By recognizing that a broad-based education 
includes fitness, they can make it a priority. By learning more about the 
newest developments in the field, they can direct better programs. 
</P>
<P>
My staff and I have recently finished a 5-year study of strength norms in women 
which taught us that it is possible to structure individualized fitness 
programs for every female student simply by grouping them by height and weight. 
A wealth of such information is out there, available for dedicated educators to 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The business community, which has long been a loud critic of the school systems 
that serve as its major personnel resource -- should join the effort, too. Some 
business leaders already know that a company fitness program increases 
productivity, lowers health-insurance costs and greatly reduces absenteeism and 
turnover. Imagine the greater benefits of a work force that arrives for its 
first day on the job already fit and healthy. To help create that work force, 
business can develop programs, fund equipment where it is needed, sponsor 
fitness award programs and work with parents and schools. 
</P>
<P>
We can see all around us the results of the failure of traditional physical 
education. The only question is how, and how quickly, we are prepared to do 
something about it. If we don't do something, our children will be too tired, 
too ill and too lazy to reach for the success their future may hold.

U.S. HOUSING NEEDS 'SOCIAL' SOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
FOR-PROFIT SYSTEM HAS HAD ITS CHANCE BUT FAILED MISERABLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHESTER HARTMAN, Chester Hartman is a fellow at the Institute for Policy 
Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time to question whether the for-profit housing system on which 98% of 
Americans depend can meet the nation's need for decent, affordable housing. 
Consider these facts: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 9 million American families pay half or more of their income for 
housing; nearly 4 million pay 70% or more. 
</P>
<P>
* One in 16 homeowners is 30 days or more behind in mortgage payments; 
foreclosure rates are at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
* Overcrowding and doubling up are on the rise; the New York City Housing 
Authority reports that 100,000 of its 174,000 apartments are occupied by one or 
more persons not on the lease. 
</P>
<P>
* There may be 2 million to 3 million outright homeless; increasingly, they are 
families with children. 
</P>
<P>
A simple explanation underlies these problems: For more and more Americans, 
housing costs are outstripping household incomes. The costs of land, building 
materials, mortgage money, insurance, utilities, property taxes and maintenance 
keep increasing, rising faster than the wages and income supports of 
lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
These problems have been getting worse, and the future is bleak. A recent 
congressionally funded study estimates that within a generation, 19 million 
Americans may be at risk of becoming homeless. 
</P>
<P>
If we truly want to provide all Americans with "a decent home and suitable 
living environment" -- the goal set in National Housing Act of 1949 and 
reiterated by Congress in 1968 -- we must reevaluate our faith in the 
market-dominated housing system. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the profit-maximizing demands of those who build, finance and 
operate housing are incompatible with the realities of what people can afford. 
Unless radical changes are made, ever greater numbers of Americans will be 
living in substandard, overcrowded and unaffordable quarters or, worse, in 
shelters, church doorways and subway stations. 
</P>
<P>
What must that radically restructured housing system look like? 
</P>
<P>
We must foster a vast nonprofit "social sector" to develop, renovate and manage 
substantial parts of the nation's housing stock -- not to maximize profits but 
to provide the best housing, at the lowest cost, for the most people. 
Government housing subsidies should go exclusively to social-housing entities: 
churches and synagogues, community organizations, labor unions, resident 
cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
It must deal effectively with the housing-cost element that dwarfs all other 
housing costs combined: the cost of money borrowed to build and purchase 
virtually every new and newly purchased dwelling unit. Roughly two of every 
three consumers' housing dollars go to pay off this debt -- directly by owners, 
indirectly by renters. This debt is, in effect, a permanent housing cost, 
because even if a mortgage is paid off, the property incurs a new and higher 
debt burden when sold. 
</P>
<P>
One-time up-front government capital grants must instead be used, by social 
housing developers, for new and rehabilitated housing. And government funds 
must be used to permanently retire the debt on a substantial portion of 
existing units, which will belong the social-housing sector. 
</P>
<P>
Occupancy costs for debt-free, socially owned housing would be roughly 
one-third of current costs. For those with incomes too low to afford even these 
reduced costs, additional housing allowances must be provided. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a restructured housing system must provide far more government 
subsidies for the ill-housed than we now provide. There are no gimmicks here, 
no magic. The gap between housing costs and the legacy of decades of inadequate 
funding means that we must devote several times what we now spend on housing 
subsidies in order to achieve the national housing goal. 
</P>
<P>
The money is there. We can reallocate current government expenditures to place 
decent housing for all up there with B-2 bombers and the savings-and-loan 
bailout. We can progressively restructure the tax system to make American 
democracy mean something, in material terms, for the ill-housed. We might even 
simply match government housing expenditures for lower-income Americans to the 
indirect housing aid given, through the tax system, to largely upper-income 
homeowners through tax deductions for mortgage interest and property tax 
payments and other favorable treatment. The homeowner deduction now 
regressively provides $40 billion to $50 billion a year in benefits, five times 
what the Department of Housing and Urban Development now spends in direct 
housing subsidies for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to acknowledge and comprehend America's desperate and growing housing 
crisis, and create new programs and institutions based on that understanding.

WEST CAN'T STAND ASIDE AS THE EAST BLOC WRITHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a Los Angeles Times syndicated columnist 
based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The German Democratic Republic observes its 40th anniversary this week in 
quasi-disintegration, another member of the Soviet Bloc in crisis. The Soviet 
Union itself, by the account of its own leaders, is on the brink of economic 
collapse. In Yugoslavia, Serbian nationalism is driving a confederation with an 
already-wrecked economy toward political upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
The passivity of the West, and in particular of the United States, in the face 
of all this can be explained in part by a lack of ideas about what to do, but 
also by complacence and a degree of Schaden freude: pleasure in watching the 
communists writhe. 
</P>
<P>
This is irresponsible, and stupid to boot. If the Soviet Union should collapse, 
it will take a great deal else down with it. Mikhail Gorbachev has liberated 
reason in the Soviet Union, which at last is responding to the outside world 
and to its own crisis with reason, debate, truth-telling and humility. 
</P>
<P>
If the reforms fail, the possibility of a return to irrationality is 
well-attested by today's empty Siberian camps, the mass graves there and in 
Eastern Europe only now being exhumed, the memory of the tens of millions who 
perished, and of the hundreds of millions whose lives were stunted during 70 
years of Soviet communism. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that there is very little the Western powers can do for the Soviet 
Union. Food, loans, technical assistance -- all inevitably are palliatives when 
a nation as huge as the Soviet Union confronts a crisis so fundamental and so 
complex. It is difficult to feel much optimism. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it may be possible for the West to contribute to a 
constructive evolution of the Central and East European and Balkan situations 
-- to an evolution unthreatening to the Soviet Union in which the Soviets might 
find positive reinforcement for their own reform. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a Marshall Plan for the East comes up again and again. One should 
recall what the Marshall Plan really was. Secretary of State George Marshall 
said at the Harvard Commencement of 1947 that because of the breakdown of 
Europe's economic structures in the war, a vicious circle existed. Farmers were 
unwilling to sell their produce in exchange for money that could not be spent 
because industrial goods for consumption were not being manufactured. 
Governments were compelled to buy food and fuel abroad, using funds that should 
be going to reconstruction. The situation resembled today's in much of the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy, Marshall said, could not be piecemeal: There had to be a general 
restoration. What followed was the creation by the Europeans of a cooperative 
organization that evolved into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, the OECD. Plans were drafted, priorities set, a budget 
established. Then came money from the United States. The result was brilliantly 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Two things, though, must be remembered: A powerful prewar and wartime European 
economy had existed, and was waiting to be reactivated. What made its 
reactivation possible was less the money than the regaining of confidence among 
the Europeans themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It is different in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Virtually new economies 
have to be created there -- ones that will produce what people actually require 
and work to world norms of efficiency and quality. None of this has existed 
there for 40 years -- for 70 years in the Soviet case. Investment is needed, 
but intelligent investment. France's ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing has 
proposed that the European Community set up a Euro-Polish investment bank to 
make long-term, low-interest loans to Polish enterprises, on a scale of a 
billion dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
This seems much better than the classic loans or grants to governments. Needs 
have to be analyzed and reform planned. Surely the OECD possesses an 
institutional memory and a wealth of experience in reconstruction planning and 
organization that could help the East European countries undertaking reform 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Are Polish-Hungarian counterparts to the OECD's original national planning 
groups imaginable, to cooperate with OECD, the European Community and the 
United States? Might such an arrangement be open to others initiating reforms? 
Could Yugoslavia, or individual Yugoslav republics, be brought into this? 
Possibly the Soviets could be associated, or have an observer role. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany is already deeply involved with Hungarian reforms, while Poland 
today has to a considerable extent become a dollar economy. Austria has close 
links with the Slovenian and Croatian economies. Is there something the Western 
countries could contribute to stabilizing currencies in the East? Yugoslav 
inflation is somewhere around 1,000%, and Poland's is expected to be 300% by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
I am asking questions. It is obvious that I do not have answers. Surely there 
are economic planners and bankers who could come up with better ideas than have 
been put forward so far. We cannot simply stand aside. A Polish Communist 
recently said bitterly to a Western audience: "You abandoned us in 1939, and we 
understood, and Poles fought for you on every Western front, and inside Poland 
itself. You abandoned us again in 1944-45. We understood. Are we to believe 
that you are now abandoning us again?"

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CAFE COYOTE'S DISHES DON'T LIVE UP TO MENU'S 
PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sopapillas, posole, jalapeno tortellini, duck breast in juniper berry marinade 
-- these are all on the menu at the new Cafe Coyote in Old Town, and they all 
sound interesting. 
</P>
<P>
But then, just about everything at the Cafe Coyote looks or sounds interesting. 
It's the reality that falls short. 
</P>
<P>
Novelties like grilled halibut tacos and duck-stuffed tamales exist alongside 
such accepted standards of Southwestern cuisine as black bean chili, blue corn 
chips and fajitas. And the restaurant itself, upstairs at the Old Town 
Esplanade, flatters the eye so effectively that after sampling some of the 
dishes you could be forgiven for assuming that all the creative effort expended 
upon the place went into the decor. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Coyote is not related to the famous Coyote Cafe in 
trendy-chic-upscale-clever Santa Fe, N. M., although a disingenuous-seeming 
menu note describes Santa Fe as the hometown of the restaurant's imaginary 
coyote mascot (artsy-craftsy wooden carvings of coyotes in various poses abound 
throughout the restaurant). The cooking style also is advertised to be the new 
Southwestern style developed in Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tackling a Tough One 
</P>
<P>
That may be true, although if the virtually unchewable beef in the fajitas and 
tacos and the asphalt-like dough of the Pueblo Indian pizza are typical of 
Santa Fe cooking, the only conclusion that could be drawn would be that the 
residents of this favored city are equipped with teeth sheathed in stainless 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern cuisine, like California cuisine, cuisine nouvelle, la cucina 
novella and all the other updates, is artificial, which is not a criticism, 
because all these styles also represent thoughtful elaborations and 
modernizations of traditional cooking styles. Cornmeal, cumin, pine nuts, 
chilies of various strengths and tomatoes thus play major roles, but in 
combination with ingredients that the original Southwesterners did not know, 
including fresh ocean fish and shrimp, which reason tells us could not have 
appeared on New Mexico tables until the advent of refrigeration. Cafe Coyote's 
pastas, seasoned with Southwestern flavors, are obvious examples of this 
reinterpretation of traditional cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, some items are both inventive and tasty. The house quesadilla, 
for example, goes well beyond the cheese-covered tortilla favored in San Diego 
to include a savory stuffing of svelte oyster mushrooms, pungent pine nuts and 
fashionable, sun-dried tomatoes, with a spoonful of fresh mango salsa plopped 
in the center to underline the overall cleverness of the thing. The grilled 
pasilla pepper, which imitates the more familiar chili relleno in all respects 
except the cooking method (chilies rellenos are fried), is similarly 
exceptional, the cheese stuffing quite suave and the red chili sauce and mango 
salsa serving as provocative counterpoints. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Happier Offering 
</P>
<P>
The scampi chalupa also was among Cafe Coyote's happier offerings. Pizza-like 
in appearance, it consisted of a toasted tortilla tantalizingly topped with 
Tabascoed tomato puree, black bean chili, grated cheese, avocado and plump 
shrimp, an effective layering of ingredients that resulted in a satisfying 
dish. (Black beans repeat endlessly on this menu, both as topping and as side 
dish, and generally to good effect.) 
</P>
<P>
However, other dishes that were as visually attractive were disagreeable, 
beginning with an order of beef fajitas, garnished with peppers, onions and 
mushrooms, that included chunks of beef that no amount of chewing would render 
palatable. The experience of chewing leather soles or lengths of rubber hose 
may not be dissimilar to that provided by a chunk of this restaurant's fajitas. 
Nor was this wretched beef an isolated incident, because beef tacos served two 
nights later included equally tooth-defying meat. These tacos were filled with 
bits of steak rather than the locally familiar shredded beef, which would have 
been fine, except that many pieces were both tough and raw. 
</P>
<P>
Things went so badly on the second visit, in fact, that one guest finally 
tossed down his fork and declared, "This place is the pits." Several dishes 
arrived stone-cold on super-heated plates, suggesting that they had been 
prepared too soon, and that an ineffective attempt to reheat them had been 
made. The good, fragile corn chips and demure salsa that arrived gratis with 
the menus on the previous visit never appeared, and all but one of the desserts 
were unavailable, but there was one thread of consistency between the two 
dinners: Sopapillas, the famous fried, puffed bread of New Mexico cooking, were 
not to be had on either occasion. They appear at the head of the menu (the 
description mentions orange honey and honey butter), and they may be good, when 
they're on hand. 
</P>
<P>
To base a Southwestern-style pizza on a cornmeal crust seems a natural, but 
this one was so dry, thick and hard that it seemed like half-baked clay -- the 
topping of fresh tomatoes, three cheeses and crumbled chorizo was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spiced Tomato Sauce 
</P>
<P>
The blend of cornmeal and hominy that encased chunks of moist duck and mushroom 
in the tamales, on the other hand, was soft and succulent, and nicely picked up 
by the spiced tomato sauce that blanketed the dish. A highly-seasoned stew of 
fresh corn accompanied the tamales and was, all in all, one of the restaurant's 
best preparations. 
</P>
<P>
A sleeper on the menu is the "lemon peppered" linguine, which tasted of neither 
lemon nor pepper but did offer the soft, seductive flavor of saffron in every 
bite. A smooth, creamy and light dish, this was an example of Southwestern 
updating headed in the right direction. The menu also offers a second pasta, of 
noodle pockets stuffed with sage-scented chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Among other dishes are gazpacho, posole (a stew of chicken and hominy), halibut 
tacos, barbecued salmon, rib eye steak (with a "pistachio Dijon pesto" that 
sounds like a classic among culinary mixed metaphors) and a peppered chicken 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
The menu mentions four desserts, but only the apple raspberry pie was available 
on the night dessert was desired. The term "half-baked" may have been invented 
in anticipation of that piece of pie, and, at $4.50 a slice, there are better 
ways to spend money.

GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN STARTS SLOWLY; 
</P>
<P>
SCORER'S DECISION GIVES HIM LONE POINT AS KINGS WIN WEBSTER'S DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Kings made Tom Webster's debut as their coach a success, skating to a 4-2 
victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the season opener Thursday night before 
a less-than-capacity crowd of 15,598 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
It was a successful debut, too, for defenseman Larry Robinson, playing for the 
Kings for the first time after 17 years with the Montreal Canadiens. Robinson 
led a strong defensive effort and even added two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, Robinson scored more points than Wayne Gretzky, who is on a 
much-celebrated countdown to his destiny as the highest scorer in the history 
of the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
As the season began, Gretzky needed 14 points to take the record from Gordie 
Howe. 
</P>
<P>
After the first game, Gretzky needs 13. 
</P>
<P>
Just one point was all he managed against a determined Maple Leaf defense and 
goalie Allan Bester. 
</P>
<P>
And a most unimpressive point it was. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's first point of the season was awarded, long after the fact -- on a 
scorer's decision between periods, in fact -- for a pass that occurred long 
before Hubie McDonough scored his first goal as a King to give the Kings a 3-0 
lead at 14:47 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
There was a carefully measured cheer from the crowd at the start of the third 
period at the announcement of the dubious point that cut the gap between 
Gretzky's career total and Howe's career total to 12 for the tie, 13 for the 
record to change hands. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough's goal was the last of a string of three quick ones in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
With all the attention on Gretzky, the most unlikely heroes did all the 
scoring, striking in the second period, after more than half the game had 
ticked away without a point for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kudelski, who spent more time in New Haven last season playing for the 
Kings' American Hockey League affiliate than he spent in Los Angeles, found 
himself all alone skating through the right circle. Robinson found him, too, 
giving him the puck for the Kings' first goal at 10:54. 
</P>
<P>
About three minutes later, defenseman Ken Baumgartner got a very rare goal -- 
unassisted no less -- when he fired a big slapshot from the blue line along the 
left side boards. Baumgartner had scored just one goal all last year. 
</P>
<P>
It was just 42 seconds later that McDonough wrapped around behind the Toronto 
goal and sailed the puck between Bester's knees to help Gretzky to a point. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey was just 17 seconds from getting out of the second period with his 
shutout intact when Toronto's John Kordic lifted a shot over Hrudey's 
outstretched glove to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Bester had stopped all 14 shots he faced in the first period, including the 
lone shot by Gretzky, and had stopped the first five of the second period when 
the barrage hit. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had one near-miss in the first period, thinking that they had a goal 
by Jim Fox only to have the officials rule that the whistle had blown before he 
scraped the puck out of the pileup of Maple Leafs in the crease and put it in 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings added to their lead in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille scored his first goal of the season 17 seconds into a power 
play, putting in a pass from Bernie Nicholls. Robinson also assisted on that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings sold out the season opener a year ago, getting their first sellout of 
an opener for Wayne Gretzky's debut as a King. But they didn't repeat this 
season, coming up short despite Gretzky's run at the all-time scoring lead. . . 
. Defenseman Barry Beck has not yet made his debut with the Kings. He was 
scratched for the opener, giving a groin injury more time to heal. . . . Mike 
Krushelnyski left the game Thursday night after jamming his left wrist towards 
the end of the first period. Bob Kudelski took Krushelnyski's place on the left 
side of Gretzky's line. . . . The Kings will play the second game of this 
four-game home stand Saturday night against the Edmonton Oilers. They also will 
play Sunday night against the Detroit Red Wings. Tickets are available for both 
games. 
</P>
<P>
GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS 
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's all-time regular-season scoring record (points and assists) is 
1,850. Through Thursday night's game, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky is 13 points 
away from breaking that record.

TEAMMATES HAPPILY JOIN GRETZKY'S CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Wayne Gretzky embarked anew Thursday night on his pursuit of Gordie Howe's 
National Hockey League scoring record, his teammates looked forward to sharing 
the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, if anything, it will help us," defenseman Marty McSorley said. "When 
great things happen, you can't help but enjoy it and feel a part of it, 
especially if it's something as big as this." 
</P>
<P>
In the first few weeks of his 11th NHL season, Gretzky is expected to eclipse a 
record that required Howe 26 seasons to accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
His assist on rookie Hubie McDonough's second-period goal Thursday night at the 
Forum in the Kings' season-opening 4-2 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs left 
him only 13 points shy of breaking Howe's all-time record of 1,850 points. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's done in 10 years is unbelievable, and everybody knows it," teammate 
Luc Robitaille said. "But once he gets (the record), it will be the cherry on 
the sundae. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember watching on TV that one year (1982, Gretzky's third season) when he 
beat Phil Esposito's record for goals (with 92 in one season, 16 more than 
Esposito's 11-year-old record). I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"But being there on the ice -- or on the bench -- is going to be something. 
It's a tough feeling to describe. You just say, 'Wow, how could he keep doing 
it for so long, every year doing the same thing?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazing thing. You play one year with him and you know he's great, but 
you look (at the statistics) and say, 'That's a lot of points.' He really is 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates, obviously, don't begrudge Gretzky his extraordinary 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the type of player you want to help achieve those goals," Robitaille 
said. "A lot of times stars are just (jerks). Don't write that, but that's the 
truth. And he's not like that." 
</P>
<P>
But will Gretzky's pursuit of the record, and the hoopla surrounding it, become 
a distraction to the Kings, who have set their sights on a Stanley Cup 
championship? 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's not goals," he said. "When it's goals, you feed the guy because 
you want him to score and he might feel (pressured). This is points. You might 
get mad if he gives you a pass and you miss an empty net, but we know he's 
going to get the record, so I don't think it will disturb the team." 
</P>
<P>
If it does prove to be a distraction, "it will be a good distraction," Tom 
Laidlaw said. "There's a lot expected of the team this year and maybe this will 
take some of the pressure off the team and put it on Wayne's shoulders, which 
will be tough on Wayne. But he's been under pressure since he was 12 years old, 
so he's used to it." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that, almost from the time he established a record with a staggering 
212 points in only his third NHL season -- a record he broke in 1986 -- Gretzky 
has been asked about the inevitability of beating Howe's record. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when it finally happens and Gretzky passes Howe, it will be a special 
moment, McSorley said. 
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky eclipsed Howe's record for assists in a 5-3 Edmonton Oiler victory 
over the Kings on March 1, 1988, "everybody on the team ran over and had their 
pictures taken with Wayne and the puck," said McSorley, who also was Gretzky's 
teammate at Edmonton. "Nobody said a lot, but you sat there quietly and 
realized the magnitude of it." 
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky gets within a few points of this record, McSorley expects the 
pressure on Gretzky to increase dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Not from the fans or the media, but from the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who are checking him aren't going to want to be the guy who is burned 
for the big point," McSorley said. "And no goaltender is going to want to be 
the answer to a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody will be bearing down and everybody will be conscious of it." 
</P>
<P>
That includes his teammates, who seemingly will relish any small part they 
might play in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played with some great players -- Phil Esposito, Carol Vadnais, Barry 
Beck -- but obviously Wayne's in a different class," Laidlaw said. "Obviously, 
the ultimate is to win the Stanley Cup, but to be a part of things like this is 
something you can talk about 20 years down the road, when you're sitting out on 
your front porch in a rocking chair."

NHL ROUNDUP;

MAKAROV GETS A GOAL, 2 ASSISTS IN CALGARY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet star Sergei Makarov got a goal in his National Hockey League debut, and 
Jiri Hrdina and Joe Nieuwendyk each scored twice as the Calgary Flames opened 
the season with a 10-7 victory over the Detroit Red Wings Thursday night at 
Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov, part of the first influx of Soviet players into the NHL, also had two 
assists for the Flames, who won the Stanley Cup last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk, Gary Roberts and rookie Paul Ranheim scored in a 3:12 span midway 
through the first period as the Flames jumped out to a 3-0 lead before rookie 
Dean Morton scored for Detroit. Makarov got his first NHL point when he set up 
Roberts' goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings closed within 7-6 and 8-7 of the Flames in the third period, but 
goals by Al MacInnis and Joel Otto kept Calgary ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Quebec 3 -- Left wing Mike Hartman scored twice at Buffalo, and the 
Sabres spoiled Guy Lafleur's debut as a Nordique. 
</P>
<P>
The game also marked the NHL debut of Soviet defector Alexander Mogilny, who 
scored the Sabres' first goal off a pass from rookie Dave Snuggerud 20 seconds 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur scored seven minutes later, after a poor clearing pass by Sabre goalie 
Daren Puppa. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Cam Neely scored two goals as the Bruins held off the 
Penguins at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins outshot the Penguins, 43-25, and capitalized on five of nine 
manpower advantages. Peter Douris, Ray Bourque and Bob Sweeney all scored 
power-play goals for the Bruins, who are 10-4-1 in their last 15 season 
openers, all at Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux, the NHL scoring scoring champion the last two years, managed two 
assists on his 24th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Hartford 1 -- Goaltender Patrick Roy stopped 30 of 31 shots as the 
Canadiens won their opener at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Skrudland, Guy Carbonneau, Stephane Richer and Bobby Smith scored for 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, Philadelphia 2 -- Sylvain Turgeon scored three goals at 
Philadelphia in his first game with the Devils, and goaltender Chris Terreri 
got his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
Terreri, playing because starter Sean Burke is still slowed by knee surgery, 
made 38 saves for his first win in nine NHL decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon, acquired from Hartford during the off-season, was credited with New 
Jersey's first goal when Viacheslav Fetisov's slap shot bounced off his 
midsection and past goalie Ken Wregget on a power play at 1:09 of the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The assist was the only point for either of the Devils' two Soviet players. 
Both Fetisov and Sergei Starikov took minor penalties in their first NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, New York Islanders 5 -- Brian Bellows scored twice and assisted on 
two goals at Bloomington, Minn., as the North Stars recovered from a 1-8-1 
exhibition sason to win their first opener in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
David Chyzowski, who signed a four-year, $800,000 contract with the Islanders 
earlier in theday, assisted on a Doug Crossman goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chyzowski, an 18-year-old left wing and the second overall pick in the 1989 
draft, is the league's youngest player. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 8, Chicago 3 -- Brett Hull scored twice, and goalie Greg Millen 
continued to dominate the Blackhawks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Millen, 6-1-1 against Chicago last season, stopped 21 shots in the first two 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 4, Vancouver 1 -- Jimmy Carson, Kelly Buchberger, Glenn Anderson and 
Mark Messier scored for the Oilers to put a damper on the debut of three Soviet 
stars for the Canucks at Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, despite the first-time appearances of Igor Larionov and Vladimir 
Krutov, blanked the Canucks on eight power-play attempts.

BRUIN WOMEN STRUGGLE BUT BEAT CARDINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA women's volleyball team, with only two seniors, is young and somewhat 
inexperienced. It is also extremely talented, which explains its success. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly headed for an easy victory over Stanford, their toughest Pacific 10 
Conference rival, the Bruins stumbled and bumbled before eventually beating the 
Cardinal, 15-7, 14-16, 15-2, 7-15, 15-6, Thursday night before 2,518 fans at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Without taking anything away from Stanford, ranked sixth in the nation, it was 
clear that the Bruins, with standouts Daiva Tomkus, Elaine Youngs and Jenny 
Evans, still need to become accustomed to each other. 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked Bruins (10-1 overall, 5-0 in Pac-10) increased their 
conference record for consecutive victories to 23. They are 20-9 against the 
Cardinal (8-4, 4-2). 
</P>
<P>
Youngs, who led both teams with 20 kills, including two key spikes with the 
Bruins leading, 10-6, in the final game, said she was surprised that after 
taking the first game so easily the Bruins were forced to go five games, but 
admitted that the team still needs a lot of work before realizing its full 
potential. "Communication is a key," she said, "and we lost it in the second 
and fourth games." 
</P>
<P>
Though they were sloppy at times, Stanford did have its moments. Hitter Kristin 
Klein was constantly a thorn in the Bruins side, serving the Cardinal to 
victory in the second game and finishing with 19 kills.

LOUISVILLE PREVAILS IN VOLLEYBALL

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't think the Notre Dame High girls' volleyball team is mourning after losing 
to San Fernando Valley League rival Louisville, the second-ranked Southern 
Section 4-A team, 10-15, 15-9, 11-15, 15-11, 15-9, Thursday at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Not even after the unranked Knights took a 2-1 lead in games and held a 10-7 
advantage in the fourth game before blowing the lead and the match. Not even 
after they had raised their hopes by defeating third-ranked Chaminade two days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame was done in by 26 kills from Louisville's Torie Sumner and 25 each 
from Marybeth Giordano and Mary Hudson, but the Knights were mostly smiles 
after what would seem a gloomy time. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (4-4, 1-1) played point for point against Louisville (7-1, 2-0) with 
strong net play by Mary Strong (15 kills), Stephanie Burns and Shannon Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals erased an 11-10 deficit in the fourth game with five consecutive 
points, three on kills. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth game, Louisville jumped to an 8-2 lead but Notre Dame fought back 
and trailed, 12-8. From there, however, Sumner, Hudson and Giordano had 
consecutive kills to end the match.

EL CAMINO WATER POLO: NEW TEAM WITH OLD LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Irene Garcia 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a six-year hiatus, El Camino started a water polo team this season. 
Youth, however, isn't prevalent among the new group of players. The average 
age, according to Coach Corey Stanbury, is 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I recruited guys everywhere," Stanbury said. "I talked to local high school 
coaches, I put the word out through lifeguards. A lot of the guys graduated 
from high school several years ago and just worked or they went to college and 
worked, but never competed." 
</P>
<P>
Stanbury, who was hired last year to take over the men's and women's swimming 
programs, rounded up 15 players for his team, which is 1-2 after Tuesday's 
10-12 loss to Chaffey College. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors lost their opener to Cypress (11-15) and defeated Mt. San Antonio 
College 11-10 last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a pretty solid team considering it's our first year," said 
Stanbury, who played water polo at UC Santa Barbara. "We're definitely going to 
win some games, and we'll be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino is led by 20-year old Dan Wilkenson, also one of the Warriors' top 
short-distance swimmers. He has 14 goals this season. Scott Peppard, 23, has 
also played well, as have 26-year-old Charlie Kissel and 27-year-old field 
player Jim Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' goalie is Ken Furuta, a former U.S. junior national team member. 
The 22-year-old Mira Costa High graduate competed in Japan and Australia with 
the junior national team. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Johnston is another local prep athlete Stanbury added to his roster. The 
20-year-old Johnston graduated from Miraleste High and attended college in 
Arizona for one year before moving back to the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure," Stanbury said, "there's still a lot of guys kicking around this 
campus that are water polo players but aren't playing. Hopefully I can get some 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino opens its home schedule today at 3:30 p.m. against Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a rebuilding year, the El Camino women's cross-country team was 
wiped out after winning last year's SCC crown. 
</P>
<P>
Even the coach is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Shannon, who led the men's and women's programs for 11 years, was named 
the school's athletic director and gave up coaching. 
</P>
<P>
His assistant of four years, Dean Lofgren, has taken over both programs. The 
new head coach has only one returner on the women's side, Crystal Neuhaus, who 
was No. 7 on the team last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the team, Carla Swain decided to switch from soccer to 
cross-country this season and immediately slipped into the No. 1 spot for the 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"She's running very well," Lofgren said. "She trained with us consistently all 
summer and she has a good base. She's definitely our top woman." 
</P>
<P>
Swain has placed first for El Camino (2-2) in all meets. In the Warriors' last 
contest, the Dual Championships at La Mirada Park, she led the team to third 
place by finishing the four-mile course third (18:44;4) overall. 
</P>
<P>
The men (1-3) were led by sophomore Antonio Carreno, who placed fifth overall 
and helped El Camino to a fourth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will compete on a predominantly flat course at the Irvine 
Invitational today. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong with five returning players from a team that reached the 
playoffs last season. That's what Mary McLaughlin says. The El Camino women's 
volleyball coach thinks her team can go all the way this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost two key players from last year," she said, "but we're consistent and 
experienced." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors are ranked No. 8 in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau, and 
they're well-equipped to defend their South Coast Conference title. So far 
they're 5-0 after winning the lower bracket of the San Diego Mesa Tournament 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Setter Joan Clemente has led El Camino with a consistent all-around performance 
that includes strong blocking. Outside hitter Kitty Kohles and middle blocker 
Cathy Alofaituli have also played well. 
</P>
<P>
Alofaituli, a graduate of Carson High, sprained an ankle last week, but should 
be back in the lineup today when the Warriors travel to College of the Sequoias 
for a weekend tournament. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino opens SCC play Oct. 11 at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mims continues to lead L.A. Southwest's strong defense, which is second 
in the state and allows opponents an average of 152 yards. The 6-foot-6, 
230-pound defensive end had two sacks, nine solo tackles and three assisted 
tackles against Valley in last week's football game. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of hype about El Camino's productive offense, but the Warriors 
also have a defensive star in back Niu Sale. The guy can play anywhere 
successfully. In last week's 31-24 victory over Fullerton he had 11 tackles as 
a strong safety. The 5-foot-10, 190-pound Sale played there due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Place kicker Louis Perez has also done a great job for the Warriors. The 
freshman from Carson High is third in the state in kick scoring. He has made 10 
of 11 extra point attempts and four of five field goals for a total of 22 
points.

EL CAMINO COACH WANTS TO GET ANOTHER MONKEY OFF HIS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino (3-0, 2-0) football Coach John Featherstone says his team got one 
monkey off its back with last week's victory over Fullerton, the team that 
handed the Warriors their only loss last season. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, in a 7 p.m. Mission Conference game at El Camino, he plans to 
remove the other one: Golden West, a team the Warriors tied last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're usually tough," Featherstone said. "They've given us fits in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
The task will be difficult for Golden West (2-1, 2-0) this time. The top-ranked 
Warriors (No. 4 nationally) lead the Mission conference in offense (they 
average 404 yards), and their offensive line is extremely tough. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Frank Dolce has completed 53 of 91 passes for 785 yards and six 
touchdowns in El Camino's victories against Antelope Valley, Orange Coast and 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West prefers to keep the ball on the ground. Running back Sean Chiatham 
leads the Rustlers with 54 rushes for 232 yards and three touchdowns. Sophomore 
quarterback Rip Slippo has completed 23 of 43 passes for 336 yards and three 
touchdowns. The Rustlers have conference wins over Southwestern and Pasadena 
City. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 L.A. Southwest (3-0, 2-0) may tarnish its perfect record in Saturday's 
7:30 p.m. Western State Conference game at Bakersfield. The Cougars will have a 
difficult time with Bakersfield (2-0-1, 1-0-1), a strong offensive team that 
thrashed Harbor 56-0 last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Renegades, ranked No. 12 in the state, have two lethal quarterbacks in 
left-hander Mike Smith and Lance Geary. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars possess the state's second-best defense, which limited L.A. Valley 
to 126 total yards in last week's 12-9 win. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Manigo will run Southwest's offense. The freshman quarterback passed for 
145 yards and one touchdown last week. He completed 36 of 64 passes for 490 
yards on six touchdowns for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's (1-2, 0-2) best hope for a conference victory will come in Saturday's 
7:30 p.m. WSC contest at L.A. Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A triumph would be therapeutic for the Seahawks, who have lost two in a row, 
including last week's 56-0 shutout by Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Valley is 0-3 after losing to Southwest last week. The Monarchs have also 
fallen to Moorpark and Mt. San Antonio College.

<P>
AS DAVIS, TEAM'S ACE RELIEVER, PONDERS FREE AGENT MARKET, CHICAGO LAW FIRM IS 
BROUGHT IN TO MAKE A PITCH AS THE STOPPER

<P>
The Padres, in an attempt to re-sign pitcher Mark Davis, preferably before he 
files for free agency, have enlisted a Chicago law firm to assist in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lane, of the law firm Sonnenschein, Carlin, Math and Rosenthal, has been 
retained by the Padres to help handle the negotiations with Beth Benes, general 
counsel of the Padres. Benes, the personal counsel of owner Joan Kroc, also is 
on the Padres' board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Padre President Dick Freeman said neither he nor Tony Siegle, vice 
president/personnel, will participate in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who saved a franchise-record 44 games this season, two fewer than the 
major-league record of 46 set by Dave Righetti of the New York Yankees in 1986, 
is eligible to file for free agency at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $600,000 this season after making $500,000 in 1988. With his two-year 
contract expired, Davis is expected to seek a minimum of $6 million over three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Davis asked for a two-year contract for $2.3 million this spring but was turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 28, has until 15 days after the conclusion of the World Series to file 
for free agency. His agent, Alan Hendricks, said that they have yet to 
negotiate with the Padres since the season ended Sunday but that he expects to 
resume talks by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have one other player -- outfielder Carmelo Martinez -- who is 
eligible for free agency but have decided that they will not attempt to re-sign 
him. Infielder Tim Flannery was eligible for free agency but retired two days 
before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have yet to decide whether they will bid for any other potential 
free agents, Freeman said, and will arrive at a decision only when the filings 
are complete. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the final numbers are not in, the Padres are believed to have made 
a profit once again for the 1989 season. They sold 2,286,795 tickets, Freeman 
said, the second-largest total in franchise history, next to the 2.6 million 
sold in 1985.

NEW ZEALAND ASKED TO HURRY WITH APPEAL; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICA'S CUP ORGANIZING COMMITTEE SAYS NEXT DEFENSE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 
1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's America's Cup Organizing Committee, convinced that New Zealand is 
dragging its feet, has asked prospective challengers to urge Michael Fay's 
lawyers to proceed with their request for appeals as soon as possible so the 
next defense won't be postponed from May 1992 to '93. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement by the challengers and San Diego precludes starting the next 
defense sooner than two years after the end of all litigation, which the ACOC 
says could take until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ehman, executive vice president of the ACOC, said in a letter to the 22 
challengers from 11 countries: "If New Zealand takes all the time permitted, it 
could be Christmas before we know whether they will be allowed to appeal . . . 
(and) another six to 12 months before we have a final decision." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Yacht Club got the Cup back on appeal from the Appellate Division 
of the New York Supreme Court Sept. 19. But New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating 
Club has 30 days to seek an appeal from the same five judges that voted, 4-1, 
to overturn Justice Carmen Ciparick's March ruling that awarded the Cup to New 
Zealand because San Diego used a catamaran in last year's defense. The lawyers 
have indicated they would wait until the final day, Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of three of the judges is required. Failing that, New Zealand then 
would have another 30 days to go to the New York Court of Appeals, where two of 
the seven judges must agree to hear an appeal. RICH ROBERTS

FAMILY TIES; 
</P>
<P>
BROTHER AND SISTER TEAM IN TENNIS GAME OF LOVE -- EXCEPT DURING PRACTICE 
</P>

Coaches are chided and players rebuked for the outcome that sometimes seems 
despised more and accepted less than a loss. The dreaded, avoid-at-all-costs, 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like kissing your sister," comes the standard reply. 
</P>
<P>
A charge that Jon Elsberry would like to address. 
</P>
<P>
Elsberry, a sophomore at La Jolla High School, and sister Branaca, a senior at 
Bishop's School, have only played competitive mixed doubles in a handful of 
tournaments, but have already made a ritual of hugging and kissing before and 
after every match. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to show our love," said Jon, 15. "Even if we lose, it's to show that we 
still love each other. It's not just if we win." 
</P>
<P>
Which they do. Last month, Branaca, 17, and Jon teamed to win the 
brother-sister doubles championship of the Equitable Family Tennis Challenge in 
Flushing Meadows, N.Y., played in conjunction with the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect it from Jon at first," said Branaca of the affectionate 
gesture. "I mean, I didn't see anyone else doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Probably because most other sister-brother tandems are too busy brawling. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," Jon said, "the team that won fought all the time, but it ended up 
bringing them closer together." 
</P>
<P>
The product of a tight-knit family, Jon and Branaca get along splendidly, as 
long as they're competing with, not against, each other. 
</P>
<P>
"In matches, if we fight, we'll lose," said Branaca. "We see it happen all the 
time. You have to support each other." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Merry of Tennis Escondido has coached both Elsberrys for almost two years. 
Merry has tried to get them to practice together, but he abandoned the mission 
because of their incessant bickering. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like night and day," Merry said. "In practice, the normal sister-brother 
stuff happens, only 10 times what it usually is. But over on the (competitive) 
side, it's a different story. They seem to get a real enjoyment out of playing 
with each other." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jon: "Most everyone else is in fights. We're like that in practice, but 
it's different in a tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Especially a national tournament, where Branaca appears regularly, but where 
Jon is still getting his feet wet and his racquet back. 
</P>
<P>
"Branaca plays (national tournaments) all the time, and Jon's only played two," 
said Judy Elsberry, the players' mother. "This meant more to Jon, he really 
wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
The Elsberrys won local and regional tournaments to advance to the round of 16 
in New York, and although the final was relatively anticlimactic -- they 
breezed past a team from Hawaii, 6-3, 6-0 -- winning with relatives wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's neat if you can do it as a family," said Branaca, the seventh-ranked 
girls' 18-and-under singles player in Southern California. "It's not like 
you're playing with some stranger off the street, someone who doesn't 
understand you." 
</P>
<P>
And since some stranger off the street isn't likely to share a ride home and 
eat at the same dinner table, the desire to win is as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"You take it seriously because you don't want to let the other person down," 
she said. "With most doubles partners, you play and then you won't see them for 
a week. It's different when it's your brother, you see him all the time and it 
reminds you of the match." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jon has had success with current partner James Conda -- they were 
second-ranked in 14-under boys' doubles in Southern California last year -- he 
still sees family ties as a buffer from the wrath of a partner. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that she understands me and won't hold a grudge if I miss a shot," Jon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But with their contrasting styles of play -- Branaca is consistent, Jon showy 
-- tempers invariably flair. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he's showy just for fun," Branaca protested. "He seems to forget 
that it counts. The between-the-legs shot, that's the one that bothers me the 
most. I've never seen him make it." 
</P>
<P>
Jon, offering a defense: "But I get bored." 
</P>
<P>
And easily angered. But not so much anymore, thanks in part to Branaca's 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
"Branaca calms him down in the three-setters," Judy Elsberry said. "He's a fine 
player, but if he gets upset, that's it. His emotions are more a struggle with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
A struggle he's slowly overcoming. "I've improved a lot mentally, she's helped 
me with that," Jon said. "She showed me that if I get mad, we'll lose." 
</P>
<P>
Jon, meanwhile, helps Branaca control her hard-hitting game. 
</P>
<P>
"For a girl, Branaca hits the ball hard," Judy said. "So Jon has to figure out 
a way to stop her from hitting the ball too hard sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Branaca's strength is such that in a match in New York, an opponent told his 
sister to always hit to the girl. Until they met the Elsberrys. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard him pull his sister aside and say, 'Not to that girl,' " Branaca said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost in spite of themselves, they have discovered the perfect balance on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring out the best in each other," Merry said. "Jon had pretty highs and 
lows and Branaca helps to steady him out. But he pumps her up, too." 
</P>
<P>
Merry said both are successful singles players, aggressive and not intimidated, 
"but they're both hot and cold," he said. "We're working on more consistency. 
Fortunately, when they get together, it seems to work for them." 
</P>
<P>
Also working in their favor is their understanding of doubles. Jon and Branaca 
were raised on the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They've played a lot, and they're good at it," Judy said. "More college 
coaches these days are looking at doubles players now because they know how 
important they are to winning matches." 
</P>
<P>
According to Merry, their background in doubles has been a tremendous asset. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the biggest factors that has helped them," he said. "They know 
how to play and that kind of experience gives them a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Said Branaca: "Most players begin learning the singles game and then play 
doubles later. They don't know how to play the whole court. Just because there 
are two people on the court doesn't mean doubles is that easy." 
</P>
<P>
There are few opportunities for brother-sister teams to play against top 
competition, but Jon and Branaca hope to play together, someday, for a Grand 
Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be the ultimate," Branaca said, "if we came back (to New York) and 
won the U.S. Open."

It seems strange to me that potties with radios and air-conditioning for 3,000

CHILD ATHLETIC INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your report on the growing number of orthopedic problems in the United States 
("Big League Child Injuries" by Linda Roach Monroe, Sept. 26) states that some 
of the causes of these diseases are overtraining and inappropriate training. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for this? The fingers point at coaches. Though this is not 
true in all cases, in many cases the coaches are oblivious or choose to ignore 
these excruciating injuries. It all boils down to this: Many coaches lack skill 
and knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
I have no forbearance with the unfit coaches coaching thousands of children. 
They have the responsibility to look out for the welfare of their athletes. 
They get paid for this and if they don't or can't do their jobs, they should be 
superseded. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent further increases in the number of children seriously injured in 
sports, a national exam for coaches should be made to determine those who are 
suitable for this important job.

A 'CAUSE CELEBRE' OVER WEALTHY SOCIAL ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not familiar with Casey and Jean Kasem or what they do, but I found myself 
reading Nikki Finke's article "Cause Celebre" (Sept. 25). 
</P>
<P>
The only point seemed to be to vent anger toward rich, social activists. Do you 
hate all rich people or just rich people who are social activists? Do you hate 
all social activists or only those who are rich? Do you like rich, social 
activists but just hate the Kasems? 
</P>
<P>
Finke seemed to find it absolutely amazing that a social activist could live in 
a penthouse, have gilt-edged china, have two expensive homes, and hang around 
with other rich people. 
</P>
<P>
Most rich people have these things, you know. If you are rich and a social 
activist are you not supposed to have these things? Can only poor people be 
social activists? Can only men who are taller than their wives be social 
activists? Can only women who don't make the worst-dressed list be social 
activists? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, being a limousine liberal or a penthouse progressive is the worst 
name you can think of to call someone. Finke makes fun of his "corny material," 
his "polyurethane voice," their 10-year marriage, their height difference. What 
does all that have to do with anything?

Actor Lance Kerwin, 28, was arrested Wednesday on charges of drug possession as 
he left a motel room near Candlestick Park in San Francisco. A woman identified 
as Desiree Posey, 33, of San Francisco, walked out of the motel room with 
Kerwin and was also arrested on drug possession charges, police said. Kerwin 
was seen last Sunday as a guest star on "Murder She Wrote" and as a child star 
was in "The Family Holvak" 1975-77. ALEENE MacMINN

A Senate committee approved a bill Thursday to reimpose advertising limits on 
children's television programs and require broadcasters to provide programs 
specifically designed to educate youngsters. The bill is a compromise between 
one the TV industry supported -- which passed Congress last year but was vetoed 
by President Reagan -- and a tougher measure proposed this year by Sen. Tim 
Wirth (D-Colo.). Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who has bitterly attacked what 
he calls "rubbish" on television, persuaded the committee not to send the 
legislation to the Senate for 30 days. He wants to consult broadcasters and 
consider further changes in the bill. ALEENE MacMINN

Producer Ted Hartley and actress Dina Merrill have been flooded with more than 
6,000 entries for a screenwriting competition they have established in the 
Soviet Union. The Hartley/Merrill Prize, which includes $10,000 and the promise 
of Writer's Guild minimum if the screenplay is produced in this country, was 
created to encourage interchange between Soviet and American writers and film 
makers. The Writer's Guild of America and the U.S.S.R. Screenwriters' Guild are 
co-sponsors of the award. The competition winner will pick up the prize at a 
televised ceremony in Moscow in May.

It will be just like the old days, sort of, when the Jefferson Airplane plays a 
free concert Saturday in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, with the Grateful 
Dead's Bob Weir as opening act. Admission will be one can of food for the San 
Francisco Food Bank. But demonstrating how things have changed in the 20 years 
since free concerts in the park were the norm there, a radio station has had to 
take out a $1-million insurance policy to cover the event. ALEENE MacMINN

Dr. C. Everett Koop, the outspoken former surgeon general, will host a series 
of one-hour specials about health care for NBC starting in May. The specials 
are not being made by the network's news division. They were set by the William 
Morris Agency, were announced by Brandon Tartikoff, president, NBC 
Entertainment, and Rick Ludwin, vice president, specials and variety programs, 
and will be from MacNeil/Lehrer Productions. In a statement released Thursday 
by NBC, Koop, 71, said his plan with the programs is "to give an honest 
appraisal of the nation's health concerns and to help Americans promote their 
good health, prevent disease and find reasonable health care at reasonable 
cost." Subjects will include the complexities of health care as medical costs 
skyrocket, malpractice, AIDS and care for the aged. ALEENE MacMINN

Actor Rex Harrison, 81, made it through two acts of W. Somerset Maugham's 1921 
play "The Circle" Wednesday night in Baltimore, but was unable to finish 
because he was suffering pain from dental surgery. The audience was told he was 
unable to continue and an understudy took over. The play is headed for Broadway 
on Nov. 20 with Harrison, Glynis John and Stewart Granger as the stars. ALEENE

'INNOCENT MAN': UNJUST TREATMENT OF THE GENRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the double-tongued lady in "Hamlet," "An Innocent Man" (citywide) protests 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
This cautionary thriller about an unjustly imprisoned airline mechanic has a 
chance to be a canny blend of gutsy melodrama and "J'Accuse" against the prison 
system. But, by the end, it has gone as slick and corrupt as the crafty old con 
(F. Murray Abraham) who advises Tom Selleck's framed Jimmie Rainwood on jail 
survival. On a fundamental moral level, "An Innocent Man" is guilty as hell. 
</P>
<P>
Hell, indeed, is the chasm that seems to be opening here at first. Like 
Hitchcock's "Wrong Man," Selleck's Rainwood is a luckless bystander: Two wild 
and crazy narcs, Parnell (David Rasche) and Scalise (Richard Young), get an 
address wrong, break into his house and shoot him down. The writer, Larry 
Brothers, obviously hates these gonzo cops: a pair of cocaine-tooting, 
hedonistic, trigger-happy cowboys who get sexually excited during their raids. 
When they discover their error, they barely hesitate to cover their tracks, 
planting drugs and a real gun on the unconscious Rainwood and railroading him 
into jail. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers had a good design: The innocent, solid Rainwood in the slammer and 
these rotten cops running wild on the outside, threatening Rainwood's wife 
(Laila Robins). But then, the movie takes a sharp, incredibly miscalculated 
turn. Faced with intimidation and rape by a prison gang of blacks, Rainwood is 
counseled by Abraham's wise old Virgil Cane to kill the ringleader, Jingles 
(Bruce A. Young). And, after a beating and a gang rape -- which looks something 
like a fraternity hazing -- he does, stabbing Jingles with a homemade shiv in 
the prison urinal after sneaking up on him from behind. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sad, sour moment. How does anyone involved justify a scene where the 
"hero" murders an unarmed, if obviously dangerous, man with total impunity? It 
is even worse where there is the implication that killing makes you more of a 
man, gets you accepted into the jolly jail-yard fraternity, puts a stop to 
strangers stealing your toothpaste 
</P>
<P>
In a genuinely realistic movie with recognizable, flawed characters, scenes 
like this could work. But Rainwood is a standard big-movie-star part: drained 
of moral flaws, a generic innocent man. Selleck plays him without agony, 
without reflection, with the stoicism of a born camera subject. He learns the 
moves of murder and jail-yard machismo as if it were another basketball game. 
We're left to conclude that this is the way life is. You've got to kill or be 
killed, eat or be eaten. It's an ugly twist and it leads into the movie's vapid 
last act, with the wild and crazy narcs snared in a ridiculously complex set-up 
involving Mafiosi, Jewish lawyers and yet another hostage standoff. 
</P>
<P>
Director Peter Yates probably wants some of the gritty, underworld realism of 
his 1973 "Friends of Eddie Coyle," but he's hamstrung. The doses of prison 
argot and atmosphere drain this movie of its rightful outrage -- as if the 
persecuted Yakov Bok in "The Fixer" had been turned into the "Terminator." 
Instead of making the fairy tale real, they make it a nightmare of sadistic 
wish fulfillment and penal envy, with situations culled from bad movies and 
names and titles culled from rock songs. 
</P>
<P>
The good things in "An Innocent Man" can be summed up in four words and one 
initial: F. Murray Abraham, David Rasche. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham gets some macabre humor out of his oily role and Rasche does something 
more. With his cheerlessly savage smile, ice-blue eyes and slightly ravaged 
features, he makes Parnell a chilling narcissist-psychopath, the ultimate 
golden boy gone wrong. Like the crazy surfer CIA agent Rasche played in "Best 
Defense," his Parnell magnetizes every scene he's in. 
</P>
<P>
And there's a well-deserved, if obvious, indictment of the current penal 
system, which the movie draws as a factory for turning out more, and more 
vicious, criminals. Unfortunately, a similar kind of system seems to be 
cranking out stuff like "An Innocent Man" (MPAA-rated R for language, sex and 
violence): a factory for turning out more, and more vicious, movies.

SWANS SONGS FOR THOSE WHOSE WORLD IS GRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conversation about the Swans used to revolve around pain and power and 
amplified jackhammers, and how long it took your ears to stop ringing after you 
saw the New York noise band play. They sang about brutality and dominance the 
way that Springsteen sings about cars 'n' bars. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Swans sound more like the early, drony Velvet Underground than 
they do like a cement mixer -- they even record for a major label, MCA -- and 
Cure fans seemed to outnumber punks at their packed Palace show on Wednesday at 
least 3-to-1. The beat is still huge, slow and relentless, but the spaces 
around it are filled with "pretty" strummed guitar. It's as if they wanted to 
show us that they could make a wall of noise from sad minor-7th chords too. The 
Swans live were pretty sleepy stuff, perfect for those whose world is gray. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gira, Swan No. 1, kind of crooned in a flat, deep voice like some 
ungodly mixture of Joe Cocker and Johnny Cash, and thrashed at one-third speed 
about the stage like a frontman on a metal video slowed way down. Jarbo, the 
keyboardist for most of the set, did as good a Nico impersonation as there's 
been in a while, like a Valley Girl doing Marlene Dietrich. JONATHAN GOLD

ATOMIC PLAYBOYS IN THE LAND OF DISENCHANTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening a show with Led Zep-pelin's classic "Communication Breakdown" can be 
heard either as an act of bravery (it ain't easy takin' on the Mighty Zep) or a 
means of setting an appropriate tone (we're gonna thrash this sucker) for the 
evening. In the strange case of Steve Stevens Atomic Playboys' show at the Roxy 
on Wednesday, all it proved was that the former Billy Idol 
guitarslinger-turned-frontman can put together a unit that's at least as good 
as any other bar band. 
</P>
<P>
Padded with a spectacularly ill-chosen James Brown selection ("It's a Man's 
Man's Man's World") and an OK version of the Sweet's glamrocka "Action" (the 
latter also found on the quintet's recent album debut), the hour-plus set slid 
slickly into the Land of Disenchantment. Stevens spewed up hot licks like a 
malevolent rock 'n' roll Cuisinart, but none of 'em connected into anything 
resembling an indelible melody or a memorable song. 
</P>
<P>
Having a charisma-free vocalist is no help, either. Interestingly, the one song 
that Stevens himself sang -- in a rough-hewn, offhanded but not unprofessional 
manner -- lent one of the few glimmers of personality to the proceedings. DON

In his first L.A. show, New York artist Julian Lethbridge presents simple 
linear webs that form an alligator skin pattern across the canvas. The surface 
is thick, scarred with brush marks or sweeping impressions of the artist's 
gesture. With the color going methodically from white to black, there is little 
to distract from the surface or the mark and that seems to be Lethbridge's 
point. Something of a conceptualist painter's painter, these works reduce 
painting to the elementals with a thoroughness reminiscent of Robert Ryman, but 
with a more overt appreciation for the act of painting. 
</P>
<P>
For all their intellectualism, however, there is still something appealingly 
down-to-earth about paintings that can carry on a straightforward formal 
discussion about surface while decked out in painterly animal hides or 
magnified skin patterns. (Daniel Weinberg Gallery, 625 N. Almont Drive, to Oct. 
28.) SUVAN GEER

Earlier apocalyptic figures by Brad Durham had a coarseness we couldn't quite 
believe. Handsome, resolved new work may show why the old style seemed forced. 
</P>
<P>
Current works feature romantic, well-modulated smudges of oil painted to look 
like a thick billowy cloud cover hovering over dark underpaint. Durham incises 
careful geometric diagrams that appear lifted from medieval alchemical texts. 
Sometimes, the sooty atmospheres cradle globs of deep green, mustard or fiery 
red, suggesting trees shrouded in the thick atmosphere of a Gothic novel. 
</P>
<P>
Durham used to tuck tension between things temporal and things timeless -- a 
thread of hope that was at odds with itself in Neo-Expressionist figures. In 
these new and lyrical works, Durham reiterates his belief that nature and man's 
will to design and devise are part of some greater spiritual mystery, but he 
does this without compromising his innately poetic and precise painting style.

If you've bought a Super-VHS videocassette recorder, you may have given up on 
finding pre-recorded tapes in S-VHS. However, there are a few movies and other 
programs you can buy in this sharper-picture tape format, if you know where to 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Where to look is Super Source, a San Francisco-based company that specializes 
in Super-VHS tapes. The relatively new company doesn't have a lot to offer yet, 
and you have to buy, not rent, but what it does have may be of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Super Source offers these movies in S-VHS: "The Princess Bride" ($49.95), 
"Blade Runner" ($59.95), "The Last Emperor" ($89.95), "On Golden Pond" 
($59.95), "RoboCop" ($89.95), "The Emerald Forest" ($49.95), "A Chorus Line" 
($49.95) and "White Mischief" ($49.95). Prices do not include postage. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a few non-movie S-VHS tapes available, including some excellent 
nature and travel programs. And in a week or two, the non-movie fare will 
include "The Nutcracker," the first in a series of Bolshoi ballets digitally 
recorded last spring. Hamilton Bryan, president of Super Source, says he is 
also negotiating with film studios for more material, and hopes to announce a 
multitape deal with a "mini-major" company soon.

Information on Super Source and a free catalogue: (800) 331-6304.

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Did it boost secretaries or knock them? That was the controversy over "Working 
Girl" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, R), a sprightly and successful romantic comedy starring 
Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford and (especially winning as 
the working girl's girlfriend) Joan Cusack. Mike Nichols directed. 
</P>
<P>
Major-league baseball has almost wound down for the year, but you can rewind 
and watch "Major League" (Paramount, no list price, R) as many times as you 
like -- though you may cry "foul" if you expect this uneven comedy, starring 
Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, to be as good as "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dream Team" (MCA, $89.95, PG-13) isn't a baseball club. However, it is 
made up of four mental patients who become separated from their doctor on the 
way to a baseball game -- close enough. The comedy features a 
just-before-"Batman" Michael Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminal Law" (HBO, $89.99, R) features Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon in a drama 
about a defense attorney who finds out something disturbing about the client he 
has helped clear of a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Checking Out" (Virgin Vision, $89.95, R) is a black comedy about a man (Jeff 
Daniels) who drives everybody around him crazy because he's scared to death of 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
And video stores are stocking up for Halloween, including these new tapes: 
"Fright Night Part II" (IVE, $89.95, R), the 1977 horror classic "Suspiria" 
(Magnum, $89.98, a 92-minute R version and a 97-minute unrated version), "The 
Return of Swamp Thing" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13) and "976-EVIL" 
(RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). 
</P>
<P>
Vintage: "Bedtime Story" (MCA, $59.95) is the 1963 comedy about con men 
starring Marlon Brando and David Niven that was remade last year as "Dirty 
Rotten Scoundrels." "The Choirboys" (MCA, $79.95, R) is a 1977 drama about cops 
in their off-hours; Robert Aldrich directed. 
</P>
<P>
Reprices: " 'Crocodile' Dundee," "White Christmas," "The Red Shoes," "Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off," "Big Top Pee-wee," "Charlotte's Web," "The Little Prince," 
"An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Popeye" are now $14.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
One of video's favorite exercisers, Callan Pinckney, returns with the third in 
her "Callanetics" series, "Beginning Callanetics" (MCA, $24.95). As the title 
indicates, this 60-minute tape is a basic introduction to the low-impact 
method. TERRY ATKINSON

VIKLARBO ENSEMBLE AT LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the music itself had been as good as the performances, it might have been a 
memorable evening. As it was, the Viklarbo Chamber Ensemble picked only half of 
an interesting program for its season-opening concert at Loyola Marymount's 
Murphy Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the concert was dedicated to music rarely heard outside of 
colleges and universities. Music by Gordon Jacob and Robert Muczynski hardly 
makes the blood boil. The second half, however, did a lot to make up for it. 
Thank Zoltan Kodaly for that. 
</P>
<P>
Viklarbo's choice of music Wednesday night may have been less than inspiring, 
but its technical accomplishment was not. Now in its third season, the ensemble 
has established solid musical values and gave intense and committed 
performances throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Kodaly's Duo for violin and cello, Opus 7, was the high point of the concert. 
Written shortly after he began his systematic collecting of Hungarian folk 
song, the Duo is unceasingly lyrical, and colorfully and imaginatively scored. 
Above all, it is an engaging dialogue of song, in which the two performers 
trade material back and forth constantly. Violinist Maria Newman and cellist 
Sebastian Toettcher gave it a soulful, aggressive and driven performance. 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Jeff Elmassian and pianist Wendy Prober joined Newman (now on 
viola) for British composer Jacob's Trio (1969). The piece has some 
English-tinged folk melody in it, lots of innocuous contrapuntalism, some 
pleasant textures, and is eminently forgettable. Elmassian and Prober rounded 
out the first half with American Muczynski's "Time Pieces" (1983), an academic 
exercise in wandering lines, pounding piano and metric noodling -- much ado 
about nothing. TIMOTHY MANGAN

THE BAND: ACCLAIMED ROCK AT A LOWER PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One reason the compact disc boom has been such a commercial bonanza for the 
record industry is that CD enthusiasts -- excited by the format's superior 
sound quality and other features -- have spent millions of dollars buying 
albums that they already had in vinyl or cassette. 
</P>
<P>
This resurgence of catalogue items was pure profit for record companies because 
there was none of the risk involved in re-releasing albums that there is in 
signing and developing new talent. But how does a company keep the catalogue 
revenue flowing after most of the choice product from the vaults has already 
been issued in CD? 
</P>
<P>
An answer is the "special edition" -- a definitive look at an artist's career 
that might tempt both collectors and fans who don't want to buy an artist's 
entire catalogue, but would like a tasteful overview. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with some of these overviews -- including David Bowie's excellent 
new "Sound + Vision" box set and the Rolling Stones' "Singles" box set -- is 
their hefty price tag. Both sets cost about $50. 
</P>
<P>
The Band's "To Kingdom Come" is a practical alternative: a less ambitious 
package (just two discs instead of the three in the Stones and Bowie sets, and 
regular packaging instead of an actual box) and a lower price tag. The album -- 
just released by Capitol Records -- is expected to retail for less than $25, 
yet it offers a satisfying introduction to one of the half-dozen most acclaimed 
bands ever in North American rock. 
</P>
<P>
The quintet -- featuring Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Richard 
Manuel and Garth Hudson -- gained national attention in the late-'60s for its 
work with Bob Dylan. But it distinguished itself with its own series of albums, 
including two works -- "Music From Big Pink" in 1968 and "The Band" in 1969 -- 
that were declared in 1987 by Rolling Stone magazine to be among the 50 best 
rock albums ever made. 
</P>
<P>
About the 1969 album, which was rated No. 19 on the list, the magazine noted, 
"As simple as a Chuck Berry riff, yet as rich and complex as history itself, 
this album is nothing less than a masterpiece of electric folklore. Its 12 
songs . . . are like excerpts from America's frontier chronicles, dramatic 
cameos of pioneer triumph and tribulation struck by rock &amp; roll lightning." 
</P>
<P>
The new collection acknowledges the significance of the two albums by including 
11 songs from them on "To Kingdom Come" -- along with 17 other tunes from the 
Band's five other studio collections. The set also contains three previously 
unreleased tracks, including live versions of Chuck Berry's "Back to Memphis" 
and the Four Tops' hit "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever." 
</P>
<P>
BETTER LATE THAN . . .: Reprise Records has finally released in this country 
"Street Life," a retrospective of the best known material by Bryan Ferry and 
Roxy Music. The album, which has been available in England for more than two 
years, contains 20 songs and runs 74 minutes. A two-record vinyl set that fits 
on a single CD disc, "Street Life" is especially welcome because there has been 
so little Roxy Music material available on CD in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry's solo material is stylish, but his work with Roxy Music is even more 
involving because the best selections (including "Love Is the Drug" and "More 
Than This") combine Ferry's sentimental romanticism and the somewhat stark, 
sophisticated textures supplied by his band mates.

'CROSSING BORDERS' PROVIDES VIVID PORTRAIT OF CARLOS FUENTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disappointment with a lot of documentaries about famous writers is that you 
don't sense the color and themes of their literary achievement. Often, what 
you're left with is a portrait of the artist as merely a celebrity figure. 
</P>
<P>
"The Journey of Carlos Fuentes: Crossing Borders," which airs at 10 tonight on 
Channels 28 and 15 and at 9 on Channel 24, is a welcome, if demanding, respite 
from mere personality portraiture. The broadcast makes constant effort, albeit 
sometimes clumsily, to explore the verbal imagery of this major novelist, whose 
detractors have called him a fraud and "a Gringo child of Mexican origins." 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Fuentes is featured in most of the footage and co-narrates the 
hourlong show with actor Luis Valdez. Indeed, Fuentes comes off as an unabashed 
self-promoter in some instances and a bit pompous in others. 
</P>
<P>
Footage of Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck from the dusty location of "The Old 
Gringo" is pure hype. But the thrust and strength of the documentary is writer 
Stephen Talbot and director Joan Saffa's treatment of Fuentes' obsession in his 
work with the anguished relationship between Mexico and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The production, shot in Mexico, Nicaragua and the United States, almost demands 
some familiarity with Fuentes' books (which include the Ambrose Bierce-inspired 
"The Old Gringo," on which the current film is based, and Fuentes' acclaimed 
epitaph for the Mexican Revolution, "The Death of Artemio Cruz," whose entitled 
character was a kind of Mexican Citizen Kane and from which the novelist reads, 
among other works). 
</P>
<P>
Interview subjects include author William Styron, who credits Fuentes' "North 
American eye" for his paradoxical Latino-Anglo viewpoint (Fuentes spent his 
childhood as the privileged son of a diplomat in Washington.). 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes' "itinerant intellectualism," which includes a professorship at Harvard 
and a Mexican ambassadorship to France, is flavored with old movie and newsreel 
clips for the movie-addicted author. 
</P>
<P>
His support of Castro and the Sandinistas, his persistent theme of Indian 
culture in his literature, not to mention what the narrative describes as his 
"ridicule of the (Catholic) church's attempts to suppress sexuality," create a 
jammed catalogue of material for a writer who has been a force in the 
internationalization of Latin-American literature.

HOUSE VOTES $22.5 BILLION IN CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM EATON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite opposition from the Bush Administration, the House Thursday passed a 
major expansion of federal child care assistance through tax credits and grants 
to states. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which carries a price tag of $22.5 billion over the next five 
years, was sent to conference committee to reconcile differences with a similar 
but less costly Senate-approved measure. 
</P>
<P>
It was part of a massive $10.9-billion deficit-reduction bill that cleared the 
House Thursday by a 333-91 vote. The bill also includes a controversial capital 
gains tax cut and repeal of the catastrophic health care program. The Senate is 
expected to adopt its version of a budget reconciliation bill this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Acting by a decisive vote of 230 to 195, the House rejected an 
Administration-backed child care plan that would have provided $17 billion, 
mainly for tax credits, but would not have required any state standards for 
quality, health or safety. And in an initial test of strength, the House 
defeated another Republican child care bill that relied entirely on tax 
credits, 285 to 140. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House rules, the failure of both alternatives leaves intact two 
separate bills advanced by the Ways and Means Committee and the Education and 
Labor Committee. Democratic leaders said that the bills would be combined 
during next week's negotiations with the Senate into a final version of child 
care legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) warned that if the measure that emerges 
from conference committee is unacceptable, however, he would recommend that 
President Bush veto the bill. "And we have the votes to sustain a veto," he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats Gain Upper Hand 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a longtime advocate of child care aid, 
declared that Bush tried to steal the issue during the 1988 campaign but that 
Thursday's vote gives the Democrats the upper hand in dealing with a critical 
national problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have now reclaimed the issue," Schroeder said. "They didn't have an issue 
-- they had a fig leaf." 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the $17-billion proposal sponsored by Rep. Charles W. Stenholm 
(D-Tex.), the House majority made clear that it favors minimum standards for 
training of child care workers and federal health and safety guidelines for 
care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said that the House would move in 
conference to drop language in the bill that would bar "any sectarian activity" 
-- a phrase that opponents said would discourage use of religious institutions 
as child care centers. 
</P>
<P>
The church-state issue has complicated efforts to expand federal child care 
assistance. Religious institutions are estimated to provide about 30% of these 
services, and most lawmakers are unwilling to do anything to discourage their 
participation, despite concerns about the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
The two Democratic plans contained in the House-passed legislation have major 
differences. However, both would provide two-thirds of the additional aid -- or 
$13.5 billion over the next five years -- by enlarging the existing earned 
income tax credit for poor families with children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goes Up With Inflation 
</P>
<P>
This credit, which goes up with the rate of inflation, now provides a maximum 
of $910 a year for a family with an income between $6,500 and $10,240. As 
income rises, the credit is reduced by $1 for every additional $10 of pay. It 
drops to zero for a family making $19,340. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House bill, the maximum tax credit would go up to $1,217 for a family 
with one child, up to $1,504 for a family with two children, and $1,790 for a 
family with three children. The credit would be increased by $430 per family 
for a child under 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A family owing no taxes would collect a payment -- identical to the amount of 
the credit -- from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The Education and Labor plan also would authorize spending $1.75 billion for 
four programs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Expansion of the Head Start program for preschool youngsters to provide 
daylong care and yearlong services. 
</P>
<P>
 -- School-based care for early childhood development as well as before-school 
and after-school care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- State grants to providers for care of children of low-income and 
moderate-income families, with an income ceiling of $29,280 for a family of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Separate grants for states to improve the quality of child care through 
training, licensing and low-interest loans to improve child care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Ways and Means plan, in contrast, would channel additional funds for child 
care through social service block grants to states. It also would assist states 
that improve standards of care. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest issue in the debate was whether state standards should be imposed 
on child care providers, including a requirement that workers receive 15 hours 
of training a year after the program has been in effect for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine spending government money to train a grandmother how to change a 
diaper," complained Rep. Richard T. Schulze (R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
"Child care is no longer graham crackers and juice . . . it's early childhood 
education," countered Rep. Jolene Unsoeld (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said that federal spending would rise to $7 billion 
a year by 1993 under the House bill -- an amount that he said is too much. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Schroeder said the problem is so severe that the multibillion-dollar 
amounts are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"California alone has needs so great that all the money in this bill would not 
close the gap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was a welcome victory for the Democratic leadership, which had 
suffered a major loss when the House adopted a cut in the capital gains tax 
advocated by President Bush and opposed by Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.).

DICTATOR BEGINS DRIVE TO OUST FOES IN REGIME

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega announced a sweeping crackdown against 
his foes inside the government Thursday, two days after surviving a coup 
attempt by junior military officers. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a defiant and angry tone before 2,700 cheering supporters, the 
general railed against enemies in the Panama Defense Forces, the political 
opposition, the civil service, the state-controlled broadcast media and the 
Bush Administration, which he again accused of abetting the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama has to live in a moment of emergency, and that emergency means that 
here there will be no room for traitors," he told a crowded school auditorium 
in Santiago, a rice-growing center in southwest Panama. "How can we have a 
democracy when we're under so much pressure?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Aides Seized 
</P>
<P>
As Noriega spoke, security forces in the capital surrounded the Authentic 
Liberal Party headquarters and arrested two aides to Guillermo Endara, the 
opposition leader who was fasting inside to protest the annulment of the May 7 
presidential election that international observers said he won. 
</P>
<P>
The raid, in which one shot was fired into the air, sent opposition leaders who 
had come out of hiding Thursday back to a semi-clandestine existence. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual maneuver that may indicate lingering internal conflict, about 20 
Defense Forces troops wearing camouflage fatigues and black greasepaint 
surrounded offices of the National Intelligence Directorate, Noriega's 
investigative police force. The helmeted troopers carried M-16 and AK-47 rifles 
and tear gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Forces spokesman said the troopers' presence was justified but did 
not explain why. "We did have an emergency situation the day before yesterday," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats said there were unconfirmed reports of new arrests of 
soldiers involved in the five-hour seizure of Noriega's downtown headquarters, 
as well as purges of suspected rebel sympathizers from public ministries. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health, where cheering was heard in the halls during Tuesday's 
uprising, fired some of its employees, one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
While Noriega's speech warned of action against a wide range of adversaries, it 
was most specific in its reference to disloyal employees of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make a package of emergency war laws," he declared. "We must 
abolish those laws that protect the enemy within the government." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strongman's Thanks 
</P>
<P>
Thanking those who backed him during the uprising, Noriega added: "In the name 
of the functionaries who acted with dignity, we have to throw out those who did 
not. We have to throw them out to create vacancies for people who do not have 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
He urged each civil servant to act as a "prosecutor" and inform on disloyal 
co-workers. "We are going to make a list, because there are many people outside 
the government who need to be included." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, he said, will be watched closely because "they are the most vicious 
and traitorous." Without naming them, he said some state-controlled radio and 
television stations were bribed by the coup plotters to broadcast their 
communique and will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old general, wearing tropical mufti and a floppy white hat, threw 
daisies into the crowd of supporters, who waved Panamanian flags and chanted 
"People power!" 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat said that Noriega had asked his aides for a list of people who 
called to congratulate him after the uprising, along with the time that each 
called. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrests Reported 
</P>
<P>
The government has reported arresting three members of Noriega's general staff 
and 34 soldiers since the coup attempt, in which it said 10 rebels died. 
Civilian opposition leaders said they believed the death toll was at least 
three times that figure. 
</P>
<P>
In his first extensive comments on the coup attempt, Noriega did not say why 
his intelligence chief and two other top aides were among those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that he was in his downtown headquarters when the company 
assigned to guard it started the revolt, he offered few details of what 
happened there, leaving it unclear whether he was ever in the rebels' hands. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he said that he told the rebels, who demanded his removal as 
Defense Forces commander in chief: "You are going to have to kill me first." 
Then, warning them that loyalist forces were moving in, he recalled saying: 
"Not even the death of the commander can stop this movement." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega said the rebels were backed by the United States "with its money, its 
bribes and its advice" in what ended as "another Bay of Pigs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noriega's Accusations 
</P>
<P>
He repeated his government claim that the U.S. Southern Command, from bases 
near his headquarters, blocked access roads with tanks three hours before the 
uprising. And, in a new accusation, he said that U.S. Cobra attack helicopters 
tried unsuccessfully to turn back Panamanian air force jets flown by loyalist 
pilots toward the besieged headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Brushing off Washington's denials, he said: "Don't be hypocritical. The North 
Americans were involved in this coup." 
</P>
<P>
He said American officials were on the phone to opposition leaders during the 
coup attempt "to divide up the new government." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition activists denied knowing in advance about the coup. They said they 
believed the plotters were interested only in changing the military high 
command and apparently did not share their goal of restoring a democracy and 
civilian supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, they expressed a belief that the coup attempt had furthered their 
goals by weakening Noriega's grip on the 14,000-member Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in their moment of greatest weakness and disintegration," said 
opposition spokesman Ricardo Arias Calderon. "It may take weeks to sort out the 
consequences of this crisis, which are still unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Arias, who was one of Endara's running mates in the May election, said he has 
been telephoning Latin American leaders to urge them to take stronger action 
against Panama in upcoming regional forums. Such diplomatic pressure has been 
weak and ineffective so far. 
</P>
<P>
The two men spoke to dozens of reporters in Endara's party headquarters after 
hiding since the coup attempt to avoid death threats by pro-Noriega radio 
commentators. 
</P>
<P>
Endara was in the 16th day of a hunger strike to promote an opposition-led tax 
revolt to cut the government's funds. Taking only water and vitamin pills, the 
portly, double-chinned politician said he had lost 230 pounds and now weighed 
245. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the press conference ended, riot police appeared in the 
street outside while plainclothes intelligence agents entered the party 
headquarters. They nabbed Carlos Bares, an unarmed bodyguard, and Melvin 
Ceballos, a press agent for the party, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The police then sealed off the building for two hours, barring anyone from 
leaving or entering. 
</P>
<P>
"They always want to intimidate the Panamanian people," Endara said. "One of 
the reasons they did this was to intimidate not only me but the whole 
population."

BAKKER GUILTY OF FLEECING HIS TV FLOCK OF MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Defrocked television minister Jim Bakker, meeting his day of reckoning after a 
long, dizzying fall from grace, was convicted Thursday by a federal jury of 
defrauding his followers of $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of deliberation, jurors found Bakker guilty on every count of a 
24-count indictment for mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. The indictment 
charged that he oversold time-shares at a religious retreat being built by his 
PTL ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for Oct. 24. Maximum sentence would be 120 years in prison 
and a $5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the verdict, Bakker spent about three hours in custody at the 
downtown federal courthouse before posting $25,000, 10% of the $250,000 bail. 
While he is out on bail, Bakker must report daily to a parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, appeared on the courthouse steps and launched into 
the hymn "On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand." 
</P>
<P>
Cutting it short, she said: "It's not over 'til it's over. I have a great faith 
in the God I serve." 
</P>
<P>
Bakker later told reporters outside the building that he was still innocent and 
vowed to appeal his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the courtroom several weeks ago telling you that my faith is in 
God. I want to tell you my faith is still in God," he said. "I went into the 
courtroom innocent of the charges against me, and I come out today still 
innocent of the charges against me." 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the swift verdict, Ricky Hill, the jury foreman, said: "We kept 
looking for something from the defense and couldn't find anything." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Tom Ashcraft said: "With today's verdict reality has finally dawned 
for Jim Bakker. He refused to behave responsibly of his own accord at PTL, so a 
jury of his peers imposed responsibility on him in a court of law." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutor Deborah Smith, who cross-examined Bakker during his two days 
on the stand, said: "The message is you can't lie to people, and you can't use 
television and the mails to lie to people and ask them to send you money." 
</P>
<P>
But George Davis, Bakker's attorney, said: "We will appeal. There is a court 
that we can go to where I think we'll get justice." 
</P>
<P>
At its height, Bakker's PTL television show was seen on hundreds of cable 
television stations. Bakker's ministry took in millions of dollars monthly, and 
was embarked on the construction of a religious theme park, "Heritage USA," in 
Ft. Mill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sexual Encounter Revealed 
</P>
<P>
His long descent began in 1987 when his sexual encounter with church secretary 
Jessica Hahn came to light. He resigned and fundamentalist preacher Jerry 
Falwell took over the PTL. Shortly thereafter the ministry declared bankruptcy, 
and in December last year Bakker and three aides were indicted on fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that he oversold "lifetime partnerships" that were supposed to 
provide the "partners" lodging at Heritage USA. Typically the partnerships cost 
$1,000 and promised three nights lodging each year for life. The indictment 
charges that 66,683 partnerships were sold, even though Bakker had made the 
"false and fraudulent" claim that only 25,000 would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that not enough lodging was built and that the 
once-charismatic TV preacher and his close aides diverted $3.7 million of the 
$158 million they raised, using it to support decadent life styles. Meanwhile, 
prosecutors said, Bakker concealed PTL's ill financial health from his board. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the indictment charged that Bakker authorized a $265,000 
hush-money payment from PTL funds to Hahn. The money was drawn from an account 
designated for construction of the Passion play amphitheater, the indictment 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Expresses Concern 
</P>
<P>
Immediately following the verdict, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter decided in 
a contentious hearing to allow Bakker to go free on the $250,000 bond, despite 
what the judge said was his concern that Bakker's supporters might hide him if 
he chose to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's supporters are "so zealous," Potter said, "they have a Jim Jones 
mentality," referring to the cult leader who led hundreds to suicide a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's comment caused Tammy Faye Bakker to groan derisively. "Ohhhh!" she 
said and shrank back into her seat. 
</P>
<P>
That was the strongest reaction from either Bakker during the proceeding. The 
convicted preacher, dapper in an ensemble of taupe pants and patterned jacket, 
sat impassively as his fate was pronounced, occasionally grasping the defense 
table in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, wearing a red suit and huge round white earrings, usually sat 
motionless, her left hand supporting her head. Silently, she seemed to cry. At 
one point she shook her head no when the prosecution implied that Bakker might 
flee or harm himself by taking prescription medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the gray, two-story courthouse, pandemonium reigned, as hundreds of 
spectators and reporters chased jurors and principals in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Several vocal Bakker followers castigated the judge and jury, insisting Bakker 
is innocent and declaring he is still a pillar of religious strength. 
</P>
<P>
"God has not changed since the days of the Bible," said Bea Martin angrily. "He 
can break down the walls of the prisons. Jim will clear out the prisons. He 
will get the prisoners saved." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the often-zany 22-day trial, which was interrupted by Hurricane Hugo 
and earlier by Bakker's own breakdown during which he reportedly hallucinated 
in a "panic attack" and put his head under a couch, the 49-year-old 
televangelist was portrayed by prosecutors Smith and Jerry Miller as a 
money-grubbing con man, a liar and a cheat who bilked believers out of hard-got 
money through slick appeals over television and through the mails. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 counts against Bakker, one through eight were mail fraud; nine 
through 23 wire fraud (television), and count 24 was for conspiracy to commit 
mail and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, defense lawyers Davis and Harold Bender portrayed Bakker as a 
visionary, a humanitarian, a man of God who knew how to build a Christian 
empire but knew little about finances -- even his own -- and certainly not 
PTL's. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination Smith asked Bakker: "Had your life style become so 
extravagant that you wouldn't have noticed a $50,000 bonus?" 
</P>
<P>
"I did not look at my checkbook for several years," Bakker answered. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's defense included numerous memory lapses, assertions that he was 
ill-informed about the workings of PTL, claims that PTL computers did not work, 
that associates were out to get him and denials that he knew of PTL's money 
problems. Prosecutors on Thursday called him their best witness. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Bakker tried to show that PTL actually had plans to build enough 
lodging for 211,062 partners, but Potter, known here as "Maximum Bob," refused 
to allow jurors to be shown Bakker's charts detailing his calculations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Constitution 
</P>
<P>
Underlying Bakker's defense was the constitutional argument that an overbearing 
federal government was infringing on the right to worship, violating First 
Amendment rights. Bakker's emotional appeal centered on the claim that he had 
been an awesome crusader for Christ, who did good for the masses by spreading 
religion over the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
"TV is the most powerful medium in the world today," Bakker testified. "I felt 
the message of Jesus Christ should be propagated over that medium." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, almost 200 witnesses testified in the trial as the two sides tried 
alternately to prove that Bakker had either defrauded the partners or stood by 
the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Their stories were graphic and passionate, as prosecution partners told of 
unfulfilled promises and defense partners praised their lodgings at Heritage 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the unsatisfied prosecution witnesses said they were suing the bankrupt 
ministry to get back their $1,000 investments. 
</P>
<P>
Following the verdict Thursday, Thomas T. Anderson, an attorney for the angry 
partners, said he was "encouraged by today's verdict," but he added that it is 
"merely the first step in the process. The victims of Mr. Bakker's actions have 
not been made whole." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Allies Testify 
</P>
<P>
As in many a classic tale of a meteoric rise and a precipitous fall, perhaps 
the most damning witnesses were erstwhile close allies. Bakker's former PTL 
associates, Richard Dortch, James Taggart and his brother, David, all of whom 
are destined for prison on charges growing out of the PTL scandal, gave 
devastating testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Dortch, with serious demeanor, testified for five hours, saying that Bakker 
deceived viewers about how many lifetime partnerships were being sold and that 
PTL money was being used to pay operating expenses instead of to build hotels. 
Bakker viewed PTL as "a gold mine," Dortch testified. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Bakker's reaction to Hahn's contention that Bakker had kidnaped and 
raped her, Dortch said: "He turned around and looked at me and said, 'I have 
not raped anybody. I have not assaulted anybody. But there is a problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dortch went on to say he told Bakker how much the payoff would cost: $265,000. 
Testified Dortch: "It was going to have to be dealt with, and I told him the 
sum of money. His response was, I hate to give them a dime but do what you have 
to do to get it solved." 
</P>
<P>
James Taggart, PTL's interior decorator, used a pointer and photographs to give 
jurors a "tour" of the Bakkers' luxurious Highland Beach, Fla., condominium, 
which had $40,000 worth of draperies and bedding, and a $5,000 Christmas tree 
with handblown ornaments.

LEADERS ARE SHOT; U.S. SEALED ROADS DURING UPRISING

<P>
Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega foiled Tuesday's coup attempt by 
persuading the rebels who held him captive that the effort was hopeless and by 
promising them safety if they surrendered, U.S. officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After gaining his release, officials now believe, Noriega had the coup leaders 
shot, possibly after they were tortured. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, under intense pressure to explain U.S. inaction 
during what critics called a "golden opportunity" to drive Noriega from power, 
provided additional details of the abortive plot. They also admitted far 
greater knowledge about the failed coup than previously acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flew Over Blocked Roads 
</P>
<P>
And they said that U.S. troops had sealed off roads leading to Noriega's 
headquarters while the coup attempt was in progress, although the action was 
described as part of a "previously scheduled exercise." Noriega's troops 
hopscotched over the blocked roads in a Boeing 727 and several smaller aircraft 
and quickly retook the military compound from the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative critics allege that the coup leaders offered to hand Noriega over 
to U.S. forces in Panama but that overcautious American officials declined to 
take him. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called the charge "hogwash." He said that until 
the collapse of the coup, American officials suspected that the rebellion was a 
"set-up" to drag the United States into a bloody and embarrassing clash with 
Panamanian forces. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney on Thursday assumed the role of Administration point man on the 
Panamanian crisis, trying in a round of media interviews and congressional 
briefings to explain what U.S. officials knew about the coup and why they 
decided not to intervene on behalf of the rebellious officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Administration was suspicious of the officers who launched the 
coup and lacked accurate intelligence on the fast-unfolding drama within the 
Panamanian military headquarters, located less than half a mile from the 
headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Risk of Casualties 
</P>
<P>
"You had a lot of confusion and you are not going to commit U.S. troops and put 
them in harm's way, risk a very real possibility of casualties (without) a very 
clear objective and knowledge of the situation and control over the situation," 
Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The coup plotters alerted U.S. military officers in Panama to the impending 
coup Sunday night but indicated that they would not attack the Panamanian 
military headquarters if Noriega were present. However, the actual fighting 
began Tuesday morning when Noriega arrived at the gates of the compound. 
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting versions of several key events in the brief 
insurrection. Perhaps most contentious was the question of whether the rebels 
offered to turn Noriega over to the American military in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary vigorously disputed allegations by critics, led by 
conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who said that the Administration had 
blown a chance to force Noriega to leave Panama and face drug charges in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, in a chronology of the coup compiled by his staff, said that "the 
opposition troops in Panama had Noriega in captivity for five hours and were 
anxious to turn him over to the United States for trial but received not the 
slightest encouragement from U.S. officials." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Helms' charges, Cheney retorted: "Fundamentally untrue. They made it 
clear that they would not turn him over to us." Later Cheney added: "Any charge 
that we were somehow offered Noriega and didn't take him is hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Administration version, U.S. officials twice offered to 
"relieve them (the rebels) of Noriega, take him off their hands," and twice the 
rebels refused, saying that they intended to allow the general to retire 
quietly in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and other Pentagon officials also offered a confusing account of what 
help the rebels sought and how the United States responded. 
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders twice asked Southern Command officers to seal off roads 
leading to the Panamanian headquarters to block the path of arriving Noriega 
loyalists -- once Sunday night in advance of the insurrection, and again 
Tuesday during the coup itself, according to a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Both times, U.S. officials declined to respond to the requests. However, U.S. 
troops did seal the roads Tuesday as part of the "scheduled exercise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relatives Allegedly Rounded Up 
</P>
<P>
Helms also alleged that the Southern Command had asked the CIA for help in 
managing the coup but that the intelligence agency had refused. The senator 
also alleged that Noriega loyalists rounded up the wives and mothers of the 
coup plotters and threatened to execute them unless the rebels surrendered. 
Neither claim could be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Here, based on current and sometimes contradictory accounts, is how the 
abortive coup unfolded: On Sunday night, one of the coup leaders placed a call 
to the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command to warn that a coup would be 
undertaken Monday morning. The caller asked that U.S. troops block access roads 
to the Panamanian Defense Forces compound and provide sanctuary for the family 
of the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, on the U.S. military base. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army South, relayed to Washington a 
key condition dictated by the coup-makers: The insurrection would not proceed 
if Noriega were present at Defense Forces headquarters. Once the coup began 
Tuesday morning, that information caused Washington to question the reliability 
of the rebels and their claim that they held Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Giroldi's involvement in the proposed coup raised serious concerns throughout 
the U.S. government, according to U.S. defense officials. Giroldi, the head of 
Noriega's inner circle of security forces, had been a key figure in suppressing 
a coup in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The gentleman who was plotting the coup was the confidant of Noriega's," 
Cheney said. "There was real doubt at the outset that this was a legitimate 
report of a coup. There was a very real possibility that this was a set-up, 
that it was an effort by Noriega to draw us in and create an embarrassing 
incident for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Granted Protection to Family 
</P>
<P>
The American response was noncommittal, according to Pentagon spokesman Pete 
Williams. While the United States "as a humanitarian gesture," granted 
Giroldi's family protection on Ft. Clayton, it was less firm in its response to 
the request to place troops to block critical reinforcement routes. 
</P>
<P>
"We never gave them an answer on that basis. We had forces in position; we 
could have done it," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Pentagon officials said, Washington was never forced to make 
the decision that would place U.S. troops in the path of Noriega's 
reinforcements. The Panamanian 7th Infantry airlifted its soldiers over the 
heads of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
As Monday morning dawned, the promised coup did not materialize. The silence in 
Panama City stirred deeper doubt in Washington about Giroldi's involvement. On 
Monday afternoon, the coup-makers notified Cisneros that the attempt was on for 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Preplanned Exercises' 
</P>
<P>
At 4 a.m. Tuesday, reveille sounded at Ft. Clayton and U.S. troops scrambled to 
get their gear for what Williams called a series of "preplanned exercises" 
designed to demonstrate U.S. treaty rights to unrestricted movement in Panama. 
Shortly after 8 a.m., when the first vehicles began rolling off U.S. bases, 
shooting began at Defense Forces headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:10 a.m., the rebels announced over the radio that they were "retiring" 
Noriega and other senior Panamanian officers. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:18 a.m., two Defense Forces officers and three enlisted men who said they 
were involved in the coup arrived at the front gate of Ft. Clayton, asking to 
speak with Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers reported that Noriega and his staff were under the control of 
the rebel forces, adding that this was an act by middle-grade officers and was 
not part of a general political uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was important not to have any incident or confrontation between 
U.S. forces and those in charge of the coup, " Williams reported. "They said 
three times, or at least twice, in the conversation, 'We want you to stay out 
of it,' " he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros asked them to bring Noriega to Ft. Clayton, stressing that U.S. troops 
were not authorized to enter the Defense Forces building and seize him. The 
Panamanian officers declined. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans and the Panamanians were talking, the coup began unraveling. 
Noriega loyalists encircled the compound and began lobbing mortar shells 
inside, as U.S. observer helicopters hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said that loyalists did not enter for fear that Noriega, held captive 
inside, would be harmed. Instead, Helms said, Noriega's intelligence unit, the 
Department of Investigations, rounded up the families of the rebels, forcing 
them to telephone the leaders of the coup inside. 
</P>
<P>
"The message of the women was simple," said Helms. "Please surrender, or we 
will be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials did not confirm Helms' account. But Cheney said that after 
Noriega had been held for four or five hours, he "talked his way out." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega said on Panamanian television Thursday that he faced down his captors 
and persuaded them to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them they would be attacked (by loyalist troops)," the general said, 
grinning. "I was not about to hide. I told them I would be there until they 
handed me their weapons -- either that or we would all die." 
</P>
<P>
A Panamanian military source said Thursday that Noriega, even though surrounded 
and not in control of the situation, "never acted like a hostage. He was 
talking to them (his captors) and negotiating the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, American intelligence officials remained uncertain of what had 
happened next. On the Senate floor, Helms said that after persuading Giroldi's 
troops to lay down their arms, Noriega "personally shot the man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sudden Volley of Gunfire 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officials confirm that several hours after the shooting stopped, a 
sudden volley of gunfire broke the silence, possibly marking the death of 
Giroldi and perhaps some of his co-conspirators. 
</P>
<P>
But a Panamanian military source disputed reports of any summary execution. He 
said that Giroldi died in combat. Another coup plotter, Capt. Javier Licona, 
escaped to Ft. Clayton when it became clear that Noriega's troops were gaining 
the upper hand, the source said.

The French government, in spite of strong U.S. protests, plans to trade Brazil 
sensitive rocket technology that could be used by American enemies to make 
ballistic missiles, according to government and industry officials in 
Washington. France has promised to give Brazil the technology of a liquid fuel 
motor called Viking, which powers the Ariane space launch vehicle, the 
officials said. In return, the French company Arianespace would be awarded a 
$60-million contract for the launch of two Brazilian communications satellites, 
they added. However, a statement issued by the French denied that a final 
decision has been made.

An Argentine court sentenced 13 leftist guerrillas to life imprisonment for a 
bloody attack on an army barracks in which 39 people were killed in January. 
The court found 11 men and two women guilty of murder, kidnaping and other 
crimes during the 36-hour occupation of the La Tablada army base, 16 miles west 
of Buenos Aires. Seven others, among them a 64-year-old Capuchin friar, were 
sentenced to 10 to 20 years for being accomplices to the 50 guerrillas who 
overran buildings at the base.

Tank trucks alternated loads of chemicals with shipments of juices, wine and 
edible oils, truckers told a House panel as it continued a probe into 
food-hauling practices. Two months ago, the same Public Works and 
Transportation investigations subcommittee was told by several truckers that 
they sometimes carried garbage in the same refrigerated trucks used to haul 
food. The recent testimony concerned a related practice: the hauling of 
chemicals and liquid foods back to back. Trucker David Helzer of Hermiston, 
Ore., said the practice appeared widespread. "On June 9, 1988, I loaded 
ammonium phosphate, washed out, and reloaded apple juice. I then loaded 
monethanolamine 100%, washed out, and reloaded apple juice," Helzer said.

Republican Tricia Hunter, newly elected to the Assembly in a special 76th 
District election, says she is already gearing up for the next campaign in the 
spring. Hunter, who drew nearly 49% of the vote, ran as a pro-choice candidate. 
She drew a strong Republican write-in opponent in Dick Lyles, who ran second in 
the race. "It would be nice to enjoy this (victory) longer before starting to 
think about the next race, but that's the reality of running for office. I knew 
that when I got into this," Hunter said. The district encompasses parts of San 
Diego and Riverside counties.

Skeletal remains recovered this summer have turned a 9-year-old missing-person 
case into a murder investigation, Madera County sheriff's deputies said. 
Authorities have identified the remains found in an irrigation standpipe near 
Madera as those of Robert Der Minasian, 26, of Fresno, who was last seen in 
1980 when he went to swap motorcycle parts with a new friend. That friend, 
identified as Jimmy Lee Sanders, 33, is being sought as the primary suspect in 
Der Minasian's death, authorities said. Investigators have long considered 
Sanders a suspect in Der Minasian's disappearance, but could not make a case 
without a body, deputies said.

Greek Prime Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis, saying he has fulfilled his mandate 
to clean up national politics, announced that his government will resign within 
four days, opening the way for a caretaker government to oversee new elections 
Nov. 5. He said a caretaker government should be formed within a week of his 
resignation. The prime minister, who heads a coalition of the conservative New 
Democracy Party and the Communist-led Leftist Alliance, said his government has 
achieved what it pledged to do when it took office -- clean up Greek political 
life from the scandals that brought down the last administration.

Israel's Inner Cabinet avoided a government crisis by postponing a vote on 
whether to participate in Israeli-Palestinian talks proposed by Egypt. The 
Inner Cabinet, divided evenly between the Likud and Labor parties, debated for 
5 1/2 hours and decided to meet again today. The discussions centered on the 
Labor Party's call for acceptance of Egypt's proposal on the selection of the 
Palestinian delegation. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud Party 
opposes the Egyptian proposal, contending that it would lead to direct 
negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the government 
rejects.

French Prime Minister Michel Rocard won a battle with prison guards, who gave 
up a weeklong strike, but tens of thousands of civil servants marched in the 
capital in another labor dispute. The Justice Ministry said most of the 15,000 
prison guards who struck Sept. 27 had heeded a union leader's call to return to 
work. Meanwhile, about 30,000 civil servants from the Finance Ministry marched 
through central Paris to Rocard's office to press their demands for higher pay 
and better working conditions. Also, unions representing nurses, police 
officers, firefighters and public transport workers have either threatened 
walkouts or staged short work stoppages this week.

ARMED STUDENT SEIZES DRAMA CLASS, GIVES UP AFTER WOUNDING BOY, 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An armed student held a drama class hostage and shot one boy in the face 
Thursday at Loara High School in Anaheim, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the 15-year-old student surrendered peacefully about 40 minutes 
after walking into the class with a 12-gauge shotgun and a semi-automatic 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded student, Anthony Lopez, 15, was in satisfactory condition at UC 
Irvine Medical Center in Orange. His left jaw is shattered, and the bullet is 
lodged in his neck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have thought he was serious?" the wounded student said during an 
interview at his hospital bed Thursday evening. "I mean, the guy was calm. He 
didn't look crazy. I asked him whether the gun was for real and then I said if 
it was real, why didn't he just start shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to identify the suspect because he is a juvenile. However, 
classmates said he is Cory Robb, a ninth-grader. The suspect was being held for 
investigation of attempted homicide at Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The youth entered the choir room where 36 drama students were meeting about 
9:30 a.m. and ordered the teacher to leave, said Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. 
About 10 minutes later, after firing one shot, he allowed the wounded boy and 
most of the girls in the class to walk out. Police negotiators talked the armed 
student into surrendering about 10:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendly but Troubled 
</P>
<P>
Students and parents described Robb, who was not a member of the drama class, 
as a troubled but friendly youth who had talked of family problems. They said 
he also was upset about an impending move to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, several students interviewed said, had hinted for the last few weeks that 
he was planning some act that involved weapons and possible violence. The 
students, however, said they had not taken him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Robb's mother, Kathy McAfee, declined to speak to a reporter at the family's 
house, which had recently been sold. Neighbors said the family was moving to 
Northern California because Robb's stepfather had another job. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cory Robb) had told my girls that he didn't want to move," said Renay 
Hill, who lives across the street from Robb's house. On Wednesday night, Robb 
showed a gun to one of her daughters -- who was in the drama class Thursday 
morning -- but did not say anything about using it, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Students said that Robb ordered teacher Kenneth Tuttle to leave the room and 
lock the door behind him. One student said Tuttle responded: "Come on class, 
we're going." But, students said, Robb made the teacher leave alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was a joke," said Season Rodriguez, one of the drama 
students. "He came in and kicked back, said 'I'm not gonna hurt you, don't 
worry.' I don't think Cory meant to go in there and shoot anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But Rodriguez said that Lopez mocked Robb at one point, saying " 'Oh, we've got 
a suicidal killer on our hands.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robb fired one shot from the pistol, hitting Lopez in the face, students said. 
</P>
<P>
"He grabbed his face and fell down by my feet," said Matt Grimsley, 15. "There 
was blood everywhere. I went to help him, but he (Robb) said 'don't move.' " 
</P>
<P>
Grimsley said another student persuaded Robb to let the girls in the class -- 
some of whom were crying after the shooting -- leave with Lopez, who was able 
to walk out on his own power. 
</P>
<P>
With only about 10 boys remaining, Robb used a phone in the classroom to call 
his parents, students said. Anaheim police officers contacted Robb on the phone 
and talked him into surrendering, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials, using the campus public address system, had advised teachers 
to ignore the school bells and keep students in their classrooms and lock the 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials did not close the school, and most of the 2,100 students remained 
there for the rest of the day. Psychologists were sent to the school to talk to 
students from the drama class. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Lily Eng, Maria Newman, Jean Davidson and Tom McQueeney 
contributed to this story.

PRIVATE FIRM'S ROCKET LAUNCH ENDS IN FAILURE

The American Rocket Co.'s effort to launch its first commercial rocket into 
space never got off the ground Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, at the 10:28 a.m. scheduled liftoff time, the engine ignited but 
flames snaked up the unmanned, 58-foot-tall rocket. A minute later the rocket 
tumbled over on its side, puncturing its liquid oxygen fuel tanks, and as the 
fire continued, a billowing trail of black smoke rose into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
It was a humbling failure for the small, 4-year-old Camarillo company, which 
had spent $15 million readying for its first launch attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The rocket failed because its engine only generated 20% to 30% of the necessary 
thrust for liftoff, according to company officials. The problem was due to a 
faulty valve, which limited the flow of liquid oxygen into the engine, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
AMROC is one of about half a dozen small, entrepreneurial rocket companies that 
hope to succeed in the growing U.S. aerospace industry. There have already been 
two successful commercial rocket launches this year in the United States, one 
by McDonnell Douglas, a major aerospace concern, and the other by Space 
Services Inc., a small Houston company headed by former astronaut Donald K. 
(Deke) Slayton. 
</P>
<P>
AMROC President James Bennett said after the accident, "Nothing good or great 
is ever accomplished without setbacks." He likened his company's failure to 
those seen during the early days of NASA. "It's not going to stop us," Bennett 
said. "We will get there." 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for a 15-minute suborbital flight that would reach 118 miles 
high in space. It would carry two payloads -- a chemical experiment for the 
Defense Department's Strategic Defense Initiative research program, the other a 
550-pound capsule designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to test 
a new heat shield/parachute combination that was to have splashed down into the 
Pacific 180 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
The failed rocket represented a loss of several million dollars to the 
fledgling company, and Bennett said it could take up to a year to build and 
prepare another craft. But the company also has to worry about its limited 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
But also riding on AMROC's scheduled flight was the future of its 100 or so 
workers, most of whom were at Vandenberg to view the flight. In an interview 
several weeks ago, Bennett conceded that if the first flight were to fail, 
causing AMROC's fund-raising efforts to dry up, the company could "stretch out" 
its funds for about a year, although some layoffs would be likely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Day 
</P>
<P>
AMROC's scheduled launch was an emotionally special day for the company's 
employees and their relatives because AMROC's co-founder, George Koopman, died 
in an auto accident in July. The rocket that burned Thursday was named the 
Koopman Express. 
</P>
<P>
Koopman enjoyed an eclectic career -- he had run an industrial film company and 
served as a stunt director on "The Blues Brothers" film -- but he was also a 
space enthusiast who raised the money that got AMROC into business. He was 
convinced that there was a market for low-cost, speedy delivery of 500-pound to 
2,000-pound packages into space. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, some of AMROC's officials were relaxed and upbeat. George 
Whittinghill, AMROC's director of marketing, said, "This is going to be the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
But after the engine ignited and the seconds passed with the rocket still on 
the ground, one AMROC employee frantically pumped her hands into the air as if 
to help the rocket on its way. 
</P>
<P>
When the rocket started to burn, Whittinghill muttered, "Oh no." George 
Koopman's sister, Trice Koopman, who was there for the launch, started to sob. 
</P>
<P>
The failure weakens AMROC's position in the commercial space race. In March, 
Space Services Inc. of Houston was the first to successfully launch a private 
rocket. Headed by Slayton, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, the 
company launched a 15-minute, suborbital flight over New Mexico that carried a 
package of scientific experiments from the University of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
In August, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems of Huntington Beach launched the 
first U.S. commercial rocket into earth orbit. Its Delta rocket took off from 
the Kennedy Space Center in Florida carrying a $100-million British television 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commercial rocket industry has gained momentum since the space shuttle 
Challenger accident in 1986. Afterward, President Ronald Reagan ordered NASA to 
stop launching most commercial payloads on space shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
Small companies such as AMROC hope to make their way by eventually charging $12 
million to $15 million to launch payloads into lower Earth orbit. The packages 
might include semiconductor, biotechnology and medical experiments that would 
be operated in weightless conditions; or the rockets would launch miniaturized 
satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
Most commercial rockets are essentially redesigned intercontinental ballistic 
missiles originally built under government contracts. McDonnell Douglas' Delta 
rockets have flown 187 flights since 1960 with a 95% success rate. The company 
says it has already booked $450 million worth of commercial orders, at roughly 
$50 million per launch, through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Engine 
</P>
<P>
AMROC's failure was especially stinging because the company is betting much of 
its success on an unusual rocket engine. While Slayton's company buys engines 
made by the Chicago-based aerospace company Morton Thiokol, AMROC's engineers 
came up with their own design. Most rocket engines rely on either solid or 
liquid fuel, but AMROC's is a hybrid system that uses both. The solid fuel, 
which is a synthetic rubber that resembles car tires, is ignited when sprayed 
with liquid oxygen. Although it makes for a slower rocket than government 
missiles, it is also less costly. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lundquist, director of the space materials consortium at the University 
of Alabama, said before yesterday's attempted flight: "I am optimistic that the 
best of them (the companies) will prosper. Obviously there are some weak 
sisters that won't. There will be a weeding out."

PELICAN SCARE;

HUNDREDS OF DEAD, DYING BIRDS RAISE ALARM IN EASTERN SIERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred white pelicans have been found dead or dying beside eastern 
Sierra lakes and streams that supply drinking water to Los Angeles, leaving 
state and federal wildlife officials mystified and concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual die-off of the large migratory birds is no threat to the water 
supply, they stressed. But tests are being conducted to see if something in the 
water could be causing the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Although the white pelicans -- cousins of the brown pelicans found on the 
California coast -- nest over a wide area of the West, the trouble seems 
confined to the eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the cause of the mortality," said Vern Bleich, wildlife 
biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Found at Crowley 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pelicans have been found during the last three weeks at Crowley 
Lake, a reservoir and popular fishing lake run by the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power north of Bishop. Carcasses and stricken birds also have been 
found farther south along the Owens River and at Tinemaha and Haiwee 
reservoirs, part of the city's vast Owens Valley waterworks. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary tests have found an unusually high number of parasitic worms in the 
walls of the stomachs of nearly all the birds, said David Jessup, a state 
veterinarian and pathologist in Sacramento. There were signs of malnutrition 
that could be explained by the worms, but the birds did not appear to have 
starved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jessup said, however, that many other causes cannot yet be ruled out. No 
significant pesticide residue has been found, but more detailed tests will be 
made to see if the pelicans had ingested high levels of toxic metals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Certain metals and chemicals have been held responsible for large-scale bird 
deaths elsewhere in California. Selenium-tainted water that ran off 
agricultural fields is blamed for killing waterfowl at the Kesterson Wildlife 
Refuge in the San Joaquin Valley. Jessup said that selenium tests had not yet 
been completed on the pelicans. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are sufficiently alarmed to have requested this week that more 
carcasses be sent to Sacramento for study in a Fish and Game Department 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
High levels of iron and zinc were found in the first Owens Valley pelicans 
tested, but those metals are not ordinarily considered toxic, Jessup said. "We 
don't know quite what to make of it," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
White pelicans do not usually breed beside Crowley and the Owens Valley 
waterways, preferring instead lakes and wetlands farther north. 
</P>
<P>
A large breeding population is found at the Klamath Basin wildlife refuge near 
the California-Oregon border, and a smaller group nests on Anaho Island in 
Nevada's Pyramid Lake northeast of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
The Pyramid Lake colony suffered a very low nesting rate last spring, perhaps 
because of a third winter of low snowmelt into the Truckee River. But the 
Klamath Basin pelicans, the only breeding colony in California, seem to be 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Problem at Refuge 
</P>

"We haven't seen anything out of the ordinary up here at all," said Jim 
Hainline, wildlife biologist at the Klamath Basin refuge. 
</P>
<P>
No identifying bands have been found that would allow the carcasses to be 
traced, state biologists said. Most white pelicans migrate to Mexico in the 
fall. The birds found at Crowley Lake and in the Owens Valley may have been on 
their annual migration, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley's water level is exceptionally low this fall, in part because of a 
dearth of rain and snowfall and in part because of a court order requiring that 
water normally diverted into the lake be released instead into Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
As the water level at Crowley falls, concern has grown among anglers and some 
officials that pelicans are eating too many trout trying to spawn upstream in 
the lake. The pelicans have been blamed by some people in the area for 
depleting the trout. However, biologists said there are no indications that the 
pelicans were deliberately poisoned.

UNANIMOUS SENATE OKS ANTI-DRUG PLAN TO EXPAND LAW ENFORCEMENT, TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate late Thursday unanimously approved a sweeping anti-drug measure 
encompassing dozens of programs aimed at bolstering law enforcement and 
improving treatment for addicts in an effort to expand the national crackdown 
on illegal narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
The catchall bill, which would extend the Administration's new anti-drug 
strategy on several fronts, was the product of efforts by many individual 
senators to impose a personal stamp on the national strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Among its provisions are measures to stiffen federal penalties for drug 
offenders -- including a 10-year mandatory sentence for those convicted of 
selling drugs to a minor -- and to authorize the hiring of nearly 2,000 more 
federal agents, judges and prosecutors to cope with the narcotics menace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marks Second Step 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the legislation marks the second step in a Senate effort to beef up 
the Administration's initiative, which was unveiled by President Bush in a 
nationally televised address Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Senate voted to add $1.1 billion to Bush's original 
$7.9-billion proposal under a bipartisan compromise crafted after some 
Democrats advocated an even larger spending increase for the anti-drug 
campaign. The House has yet to take action on the Administration plan. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the measure came after the Senate, in a sign of its anti-drug zeal, 
voted approval of more than a dozen amendments without debate. 
</P>
<P>
Among those measures was a proposal by Sen. Pete Wilson (D-Calif.) that urges 
the President to negotiate with the government of Mexico to allow U.S. 
authorities to pursue suspected drug traffickers across the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Other provisions, some of which were approved earlier this week, would for the 
first time authorize medical treatment on request for indigent drug addicts and 
launch a $500,000 pilot program for drug testing of federal prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant elements in the legislation would provide reinforcements 
for federal law enforcement efforts, which have been strained by the anti-drug 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
It authorizes the hiring of 1,000 additional FBI agents, 350 additional agents 
for the Drug Enforcement Administration, 300 more U.S. attorneys and earmarks a 
total of $26 million to provide additional law enforcement assistance to deal 
with the war on narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, under an amendment introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the measure provides for the immediate 
hiring of 20 new federal judges to be dispatched to Los Angeles, Miami, Houston 
and other cities in which drug trafficking is intensive. 
</P>
<P>
In boosting penalties for drug offenders, the legislation directs federal 
judges to deny bond privileges for convicted drug traffickers as they seek to 
appeal their convictions. It doubles to 10 years the mandatory sentence for 
federal crimes committed with automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The stiffer penalties, including the new 10-year mandatory sentence for those 
who peddle drugs to minors, would apply only to federal crimes, which make up 
only a small percentage of all drug offenses. But Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), 
sponsor of the provision, urged that the stiff sentence for selling drugs to 
children be adopted by "all 50 states." 
</P>
<P>
The exact price tag for the measure could not be determined amid the scramble 
of amendments and votes that preceded final passage of the legislation, but its 
total was in excess of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
While approving the vast majority of amendments offered to the bill, the Senate 
drew the line on two controversial proposals. 
</P>
<P>
It killed an amendment that would have permitted government agents to shoot 
down, as a last resort, private planes smuggling illegal drugs into the United 
States. The measure, offered by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was a toned-down 
version of a proposal approved by the Senate earlier this year. Hoping to 
attract wider support, McConnell had revised his proposal to include new 
safeguards against the accidental killing of innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
But the Senate voted, 52 to 48, to kill the amendment after Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio), a former Marine fighter pilot, denounced it as "ludicrous." The 
rejection makes it unlikely that any shoot-down proposal will win approval of 
the full Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected, 75 to 24, a proposal by Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) 
that would have required mandatory drug testing for parents receiving welfare 
benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Californians Fire Salvo 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, several California congressmen fired another salvo at the 
Bush Administration for its delay in deciding which areas will be given special 
status as major fronts in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, all Democrats, expressed outrage that William J. Bennett, 
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, had not responded to 
their requests to include Southern California, even after last week's 
unprecedented cocaine haul in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has until February to announce whether Los Angeles will 
receive special status.

SAVIMBI AGREES TO RETURN TO TALKS ON ANGOLAN PEACE 
</P>

<P>
Jonas Savimbi, the leader of rebels trying to overthrow the Marxist government 
of Angola, agreed Thursday to return to negotiations intended to end a 14-year 
civil war in the southern African nation. 
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's promise came after prodding from President Bush, who rewarded Savimbi 
by issuing statements of continued U.S. support for the rebel movement. The 
Angolan peace effort is directed by President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives in this country have kept up pressure on successive U.S. 
administrations to maintain assistance to the anti-Marxist rebels. Most 
recently, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, complained that Mobutu cut off supply links 
that pass through Zaire to Savimbi's forces, the Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA). 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that 
the President used his 30-minute meeting with Savimbi "to stress the United 
States' continued support for UNITA and the goal of national reconciliation in 
Angola." 
</P>
<P>
However, the statement noted, Bush also urged Savimbi "to work with President 
Mobutu and others in the region to foster the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush reminded Savimbi of the United States' "longstanding 
support for a cease-fire and face-to-face negotiations and, ultimately, free 
and fair elections" in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire between Savimbi's forces and the army of the Angolan government, 
led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, was reached June 22. But it began to 
falter two months later. 
</P>
<P>
After his meeting in the Oval Office, Savimbi said that he was "reassured by 
the President of the continued support of the United States to UNITA." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, "we accepted . . . that President Mobutu is the mediator" of 
talks between the rebel movement and the Angolan government. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was ready to return to cease-fire talks, he replied, 
"Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Savimbi had balked at attending a recent round of peace talks intended to 
smooth out differences over the interpretation of the June 22 agreement. 
Savimbi has implicitly accused Mobutu of concluding secret deals with Angola to 
change the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos has argued that under the agreement, Savimbi was to step down from 
his leadership of UNITA and integrate his forces with those of the Angolan 
military. Savimbi has denied such an interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met with Mobutu on Wednesday, urging him to "work out any differences" to 
meet "the goal of national reconciliation," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mobutu has been very constructive in serving as a mediator. . . . We want that 
to continue," Fitzwater said.

ESTONIANS BACK DOWN IN DISPUTE WITH KREMLIN

<P>
The Estonian Parliament backed down in a dispute with the Kremlin on Thursday, 
suspending clauses in a local election law that deprived thousands of Russian 
immigrants of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Estonian radio said 172 of the 243 deputies accepted a proposal by the 
republic's president, Arnold Ruutel, to suspend provisions of the law that 
allowed only people who had lived in the republic for at least two years to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The law provoked a rash of strikes by local ethnic Russian workers after it was 
passed by the Estonian Parliament in August. 
</P>
<P>
"It was decided to modify the law in view of the current political situation 
and, in particular, because of the threat of more strikes," a journalist at 
Estonian television told Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise, which will allow all residents to take part in local elections 
Dec. 10, appears to be part of an attempt by Estonia's reformist leadership to 
steer away from conflict with Moscow over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The move was attacked by Estonian nationalists who are pressing for a return to 
the independence enjoyed by the republic until 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"We never expect much from this puppet Parliament anyway," said Trivimi 
Velliste, president of the nationalist Estonian Heritage Foundation. "But how 
can the Parliament vote one way in August and another way now?" 
</P>
<P>
Estonian journalists said deputies agreed to Ruutel's appeal to suspend the 
clause apparently in an attempt to rectify what had appeared to have been a 
political miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of how many of the republic's 1.5 million people were disenfranchised 
by the law varied between 10,000 and 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
They are among hundreds of thousands of Russians and other non-Estonians who 
moved to the republic since 1940 as part of a policy of "Russification." 
</P>
<P>
The residence requirement brought the republic's leadership into conflict with 
members of the Russian minority, who said the law made them second-class 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
It was condemned by the Kremlin, which declared that it was incompatible with 
provisions of the Soviet constitution, which guarantee the vote to every 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy also appeared to play a large part in provoking a denunciation 
by the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee of nationalism and separatism 
in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Estonian deputies pledged Thursday to continue discussion of even more 
controversial plans to introduce a separate Estonian citizenship alongside the 
Soviet one, to which the right to vote would be tied in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin faced another nationalist headache this weekend in the Baltic 
region, where the radical Latvian Popular Front is expected to approve a 
program calling for progress toward the republic's secession from the Soviet 
Union, a spokesman said.

BUSH HAILS GERMAN EXODUS BUT BERLIN EMBASSY IS PUT 'OFF LIMITS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although President Bush declared Thursday that he is deeply moved by the flight 
of East Germans to the West and that "America stands with the forces of 
change," the State Department announced that the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin 
will not become a haven for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, which was drawn into the escalating drama when 18 East 
Germans pushed their way into the embassy earlier this week, negotiated an 
accommodation with the Communist government effectively closing the embassy to 
future refugees while allowing the 18 to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The embassy that we have in Berlin is, of course, not set up as a place where 
people can go," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "Our embassies 
and other diplomatic missions overseas generally do not have the capability to 
handle even a limited number of people who would seek to depart their home 
country, especially people who have to seek to depart their home country by 
sitting in at a foreign embassy." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the embassy "remains open for people with normal embassy 
business," which clearly excludes desperate people trying to flee East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Despite decades of impassioned rhetoric in support of free emigration, the U.S. 
government is reluctant to play an active role in the frenzied scramble by East 
Germans to reach West Germany because it is concerned that forceful involvement 
might upset U.S.-Soviet relations or trigger a harsh crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bush illustrated the paradox in his remarks to a Rose Garden audience that 
included several members of the Bundestag, the lower house of the West German 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"We are riveted, and I am moved, by the tens of thousands of East Germans 
sacrificing all that they own, leaving everything behind, to find their way to 
a West that offers the promise of freedom and opportunity," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also look forward to the day that Germans will not have to climb fences, 
freeze in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a 
free society," the President said as he signed a German-American day 
proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
But East Germany has responded to the flight of its citizens not by relaxing 
controls, as Bush urged, but by imposing new restrictions on travel to 
Czechoslovakia, one of the main routes that East Germans have taken to the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
With the new travel ban, which echoes earlier restrictions on travel to Hungary 
and Poland, the only way out of East Germany may prove to be over the fence 
surrounding one of the Western embassies in the East German capital. And that 
may drag the Administration back into the crisis, despite its best efforts to 
remain aloof. 
</P>
<P>
"If these travel restrictions are going to be enforced and if there isn't any 
give in the East German regime, the situation will become more and more 
explosive," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and National 
Security Council expert on Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This virus is infecting the entire population," he said. "It presents the 
nightmare scenario on how things might really become unglued in central 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenfeldt said that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "has his work cut 
out for him" to persuade the East Germans to ease the travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We and the British and the French (embassies) will confront this more and 
more," he said. "We have limited space, so we have to hope that we will not be 
faced with thousands of people." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a sudden rush of refugees to Western embassies, East German police 
almost certainly would try to prevent them from reaching the buildings. The 
police did just that Wednesday when hundreds of East Germans attempted to 
follow the 18 asylum-seekers into the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the U.S. government objected to the police action and "sought 
assurances that visitors with normal embassy business will not be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department spokesman made it clear that the U.S. government does not 
consider attempts to obtain asylum to be "normal embassy business." But, he 
added, "We deplore the manhandling of the crowd by the East German police." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Poland, Hungary or even the Soviet Union, the East German government may 
be unable to relax its iron grip much. Communist ideology is the major thing 
that differentiates East Germany from its larger and richer neighbor, West 
Germany. But the regime seems to be finding it more difficult every year to 
maintain its ideological edge. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be some significant support for all of those Eastern European 
regimes," said Charles William Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. "Now 
I don't think there is any. The prewar regimes had been so bankrupt and had led 
the countries into such disasters that there was a willingness on the part of a 
significant portion of the population to acquiesce in the new system. I think 
that has all been burned out. There is no starch to the regime. There is nobody 
at the middle levels who believes." 
</P>
<P>
Maynes said that the East German regime has "only two choices -- put a wall 
along every border or establish an orderly procedure for emigration." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Hunter, director of European Studies at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington, said: "It is hard to believe that East 
Germany will permit itself to be bled to death, as much as we might like to see 
it. We are not dealing with a bunch of pussycats. We are dealing with people 
who are heavily armed and strongly motivated to prevent the destruction of 
their society."

MUBARAK'S SLOW, STEADY DIPLOMATIC PACE FINALLY PAYING OFF

At first, they called him "Colonel Cow Eyes," testimony to his years as an air 
force bomber pilot and the droopy brown eyes that made him look forever on the 
edge of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Hosni Mubarak, one old joke went, had gone riding with his chauffeur a day 
after assuming the Egyptian presidency and came to a fork in the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Which way would Nasser go?" Mubarak supposedly inquired. 
</P>
<P>
"He always went to the left," the driver replied. 
</P>
<P>
"And Sadat?" 
</P>
<P>
"To the right." 
</P>
<P>
"Very well," Mubarak replied decisively. "Signal left, signal right, and park." 
</P>
<P>
After three decades of charismatic leadership that had thrust Egypt to the 
forefront of world diplomacy, first under Gamal Abdel Nasser's vision for a 
united Arab world, then Anwar Sadat's historic peace initiative that led to the 
Camp David accords, Egypt after Mubarak assumed the presidency in 1981 settled 
onto an uncertain road of chilly peace with Israel and isolation from its Arab 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with conflict, Mubarak forged a course squarely down the middle. When 
Palestinians launched an uprising to press their demand for a homeland, he 
quietly advocated a dialogue with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraq went to war with Iran, Mubarak, ignoring outraged advisers who 
complained that Iraq had refused to resume diplomatic relations with Egypt 
after Camp David, quietly shipped arms to aid the Arab cause. 
</P>
<P>
Other advisers say they urged Mubarak to respond to the anti-Egypt propaganda 
campaign being waged by the rest of the Arab world. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
Now, suddenly, Mubarak is in the midst of an unprecedented diplomatic 
offensive, championing a drive to sponsor direct Israeli-Palestinian peace 
talks in Cairo, flying to African capitals to mediate ethnic and border 
disputes and pressing the case of Third World economic troubles at European 
summits. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he discussed his Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative at the U.N. 
General Assembly, and he discussed the same subject with President Bush last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Years of Patience 
</P>
<P>
This is not, a number of diplomats and analysts say, a new Hosni Mubarak. This 
is the old Hosni Mubarak finally paying off. This, said one, is the product of 
eight years of patience and steadiness and incremental diplomacy: "He has 
always said, 'I am the man of the middle of the road.' Now we see that all the 
roads led into his office." 
</P>
<P>
Sadat, said another, had the vision that led Egypt into what remains the only 
Arab peace treaty with Israel, "but it was Mubarak who toughed it out." 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League's historic decision this year to open its arms again to Egypt 
was only the beginning of a period of hyperactive diplomacy for Mubarak and 
Egypt's massive foreign service corps. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Mubarak was elected chairman of the 50-member Organization of African 
Unity, touching off a round of initiatives in which he has sought to organize a 
direct confrontation on the problem of Third World debt, arguing that rich 
countries have as much to lose as debtor nations in the event of an 
international economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after taking over the OAU, he convened a mini-summit in 
Harare, Zimbabwe, to devise a strategy for ethnic peace in southern Africa. 
Next, he convened a three-day international debt seminar in Cairo. Then, it was 
off to the Nonaligned Movement summit in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where he again 
called for an international dialogue to help resolve the problem of Third World 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
On the way home, he stopped off in Mauritania and Senegal, delivering a 
proposal for resolving a long-simmering border dispute, and dispatched similar 
offers of help to Ethiopia and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the presidential palace was the site of one press briefing after 
another as dignitaries from Israel, Sweden and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization flew in for talks on Mubarak's 10-point proposal for guiding 
discussions on elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
None of this diplomatic frenzy has borne fruit yet. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts say it appears to signal a return to Egypt's historic role as 
a leader and mediator in the Arab world. Egyptians, both in government and on 
street corners, have always talked about Egypt's "role" in the Middle East, 
back through 7,000 years of history. One Western diplomat said an Israeli once 
explained to him that Egypt's view of that role has to do with the Arabic word 
that is used: dur. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A God-Given Burden' 
</P>
<P>
"He claims the word can't be translated in English," the diplomat explained, 
"but it can be translated in Hebrew. It has a connotation of a God-given burden 
that must be borne." 
</P>
<P>
Ali E. Hillal Dessouki, a well-known political scientist at Cairo University, 
said Egypt under Mubarak has also come to learn that its influence on the world 
stage depends to a large extent on its influence in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Other Middle East analysts say Mubarak's diplomatic efforts have all been 
tinged with a substantial dose of self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Egypt has been weathering the unpleasant effects of its peace 
treaty with Israel for a decade and now realizes that there will be no abiding 
peace until the Palestinian issue is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
While Egyptians have a great deal to gain through the peace process, said one 
senior Western analyst, "the down side is they have more to lose now if things 
don't go well." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Egypt has more to gain than diplomatic kudos from better Arab relations. 
The newly opened border with Libya is likely to mean a major new job market for 
Egyptians, and Egyptian ministers are already working to capitalize on friendly 
relations with the oil-rich gulf states by luring new investments into Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia and Sudan, Egypt sees not only the dream of African harmony, but 
perhaps more important, the sources from which flow Egypt's lifeline, the Nile. 
"As a result, the kind of thing Egyptians really, really don't like to see is 
Arabs and Africans squabbling," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that Mubarak, head of a nation that was historically the 
guidepost of the Arab world, is likely to find himself as OAU chairman 
championing the cause of the majority of his constituents in the organization: 
black non-Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
But the burly, plain-spoken president can probably carry it off, if anyone can, 
most Western diplomats agree. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Egypt's domestic problems are worse under Mubarak, but he has 
convinced much of the Egyptian public that he is doing as much as anyone could 
to resolve them, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nasser and Sadat both tried to have cults of personalities," Dessouki said. 
Their faces were on posters everywhere. Popular songs about them were played on 
the radio. "Now, for example, we don't have a single song on Mubarak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is low-profile, cautious, calculative, doesn't take great risks, 
incremental, adaptive, a moderator. But he is a man of the people, period. When 
he moves and talks, he is your cousin, your brother."

NOT ALWAYS EASY TO GET A BILL OUT OF THE WOODS; 
</P>
<P>
IN A TYPICAL CASE, CAPITAL GAINS MEASURE HAD TO BE STEERED THOUGH FOREST OF 
TIMBER INTERESTS 
</P>

<P>
Tree owners will undoubtedly be grateful to Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
As the narrowly divided Senate Finance Committee neared its showdown over 
capital gains taxes earlier this week, Pryor was a crucial swing vote. Because 
he represents a state where timber interests carry a lot of political clout, 
lawmakers seeking to woo him used an appropriate bait -- tax breaks worth 
hundreds of millions to timber owners. 
</P>
<P>
The bidding war over Pryor's vote, which repeated methods used last week in the 
House capital gains fight, illustrates the importance special interests play in 
shaping legislation with supposedly broader goals in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 8 million tree farm owners in 26 states are represented by a 
bipartisan forestry caucus of 121 lawmakers. The caucus has grown into one of 
the most potent political forces in Congress. Indeed, the White House was so 
impressed with its ability to sway lawmakers that President Bush went out of 
his way during the House battle to meet with a group of tree owners and visit a 
picturesque Maine timber operation -- with network television cameras in tow. 
</P>
<P>
In the Finance Committee showdown, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) led the GOP fight 
for a capital gains tax cut. His package pointedly included two extra tax 
breaks targeted primarily on timber owners. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone, Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) added two others to his 
competing tax plan. The Bentsen plan focused on providing an extension of tax 
deductions for individual retirement accounts instead of the capital gains tax 
cut advocated by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor, who earlier had expressed interest in a compromise over capital gains, 
ultimately lined up behind Bentsen's package. It was approved by the committee 
when Packwood's capital gains proposal lost by the narrowest of margins on a 
10-10 tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
But the battle is not over. The tax bill now moves to the Senate floor, where a 
showdown between capital gains and IRAs is expected this weekend. No matter 
which way the vote ends up, though, timber interests can't lose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Income Averaging 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bentsen bill adopted by the Finance Committee, timber owners would 
get relief from anti-tax-shelter rules, providing them with an estimated $140 
million in tax benefits over the next five years. Moreover, tree farmers would 
be the chief beneficiaries of a five-year, $295-million provision to restore 
income averaging to all farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Packwood's capital gains package, which is expected to challenge Bentsen's plan 
on the Senate floor, also takes aim directly at timber state lawmakers like 
himself. One provision, designed to overturn an IRS ruling, would allow 
immediate write-off of fertilizer expenses used to grow timber. At the same 
time, Packwood added a lower corporate capital gains rate of 27.9% to the 
proposal. However, the limit applies only to assets that don't generate profits 
unless held at least eight years -- assets like trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Would that have anything in common with the fertilizer provision?" wondered 
Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), whose question was met by general laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Packwood pulled no punches in his reply. "For timber," he said, "this is the 
best provisions they are likely to see." 
</P>
<P>
Belatedly, lawmakers are now expressing second thoughts about the timber and 
other special interest provisions added to the tax bill. Pryor, in a Senate 
speech Thursday evening, acknowledged that he was one of the prime 
beneficiaries of what he called the committee's "feeding frenzy," adding: "We 
did not act responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
And Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) suggested Thursday 
evening that lawmakers might try to remove many of the unnecessary tax breaks 
from the overall budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the timber industry was not supposed to benefit from the capital 
gains cut. Bush's original tax measure provided a lower tax rate exclusively 
for stocks, bonds, and residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
But then the politics of Capitol Hill took over. Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.), a 
timber-state lawmaker, fashioned a capital gains proposal that would cut the 
rate to 19.6% only through 1991, but also extended the tax break to timber, 
commercial real estate and most other assets. With the White House approach 
dying on the vine, Administration officials "saw this was the best vehicle in 
town" Jenkins said, "and they decided to ride it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they did. White House budget Director Richard G. Darman, the architect 
of the Administration's capital gains strategy, became an unabashed convert to 
the timber cause. 
</P>
<P>
"A vote against capital gains," Darman told reporters just before the House 
balloting, "is a vote against farmers, small owners of timber stands, people 
who raise Christmas trees. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Margin 
</P>
<P>
After winning on a 19-17 vote in the House Ways and Means Committee, Jenkins' 
package prevailed on the House floor by a surprisingly wide margin -- 239 to 
190. And of the 63 Democrats who bucked their party line and voted with the 
majority, more than half represented timber districts. 
</P>
<P>
Not all lawmakers from timber states see the House measure as a plus. Rep. Les 
AuCoin (D-Ore.) is a long-time supporter of lower capital gains taxes but he 
voted against the Jenkins measure because he worries that it will encourage 
timber owners to decimate their forests in a rush to take advantage of the 
temporarily lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
"We need something that encourages long-term investment rather than reaping 
short-term windfalls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Ron Wyden, also an Oregon Democrat, backed the bill as the best way to 
restore a special tax advantage for capital gains. "I would have voted for this 
if it didn't have a stick of timber," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyden, however, had little to worry about. Even the alternative plan advanced 
by House Democratic leaders would have kept the anti-tax-shelter timber 
provision, which Wyden proposed as a way to encourage private wood lot owners 
to replant their forests. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that has across-the-board support from environmental 
groups," Wyden said. "I don't see this as special interest legislation."

ABORTION FOE CHOOSES JAIL OVER FINE IN ATLANTA CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry was fined $1,000 Thursday for an 
anti-abortion blockade of a medical clinic during last year's Democratic 
National Convention but opted for two years in jail instead. 
</P>
<P>
"In good conscience I cannot pay the fine," said Terry, 30, who while acting as 
his own attorney during the trial, argued that he had the right to break "man's 
laws to uphold God's laws by saving unborn children." 
</P>
<P>
Terry was convicted by a jury Sept. 29 in Fulton County State Court of trespass 
and unlawful assembly resulting from a demonstration at the Atlanta SurgiCenter 
in July, 1988. The demonstration resulted in the arrest of 139 anti-abortion 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,100 Arraigned 
</P>
<P>
Since that incident, another 1,100 activists have been arraigned for a series 
of similar demonstrations in the city, and officials estimate that police and 
court costs to the city are running in the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic leader and his anti-abortion group have blockaded hundreds of 
clinics nationwide and have been embroiled in more than 150 trespass court 
cases. An estimated 28,000 to 35,000 protesters have been arrested. Last month 
he was acquitted by a Los Angeles jury of trespass charges stemming from 
blockades at two women's clinics. He is due back in Los Angeles in December to 
face conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Chief Assistant Solicitor Robert Lee O'Brien, whose home was 
picketed by anti-abortion demonstrators during the trial, had asked the court 
to give Terry two years in jail, the maximum penalty. However, Fulton County 
Judge John Bruner suspended the jail term on condition Terry pay a fine, stay 
out of the Atlanta area for two years and not violate any Georgia laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Criminal' 
</P>
<P>
Terry told the judge: "I'm in your hands. I've requested no fines or 
imprisonment. I am not a criminal. I was there for the purpose of saving 
babies." 
</P>
<P>
Bruner, who had continually admonished Terry for trying to make abortion the 
issue, shot back: "I won't be preached to." O'Brien said Thursday, "Terry told 
me in court that I had blood on my hands for prosecuting him and that God would 
punish me, but never once did he deny the criminal trespass charges." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said Terry would serve his time at one of the county's jail work camps 
where "they spend a lot of time breaking up rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Terry had tried to argue that his actions were intended to save lives of the 
unborn, but Judge Bruner ruled that he could not use the necessity defense 
because it did not pertain directly to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue officials say that they will appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who would lead the organization's rallies if Terry decides to stay in 
jail, Operation Rescue official Joseph Foreman, said: "Sometimes you can lead 
better from jail than other places. . . . If people care, it is far more 
effective than an appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Jewitt, Atlanta's Operation Rescue coordinator, said that they plan to jam 
phone lines to city and county government offices in Atlanta to protest the 
sentence. "We are already getting calls from all over America. The Christian 
public is outraged. . . . He was railroaded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Fine to Be Paid 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for 
Women, which has battled Operation Rescue in court on numerous occasions, said 
Thursday: "He clearly wants to play Daniel in the lions' den. His friends will 
ultimately pay his fine, but in the meantime he'll get a lot of publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Ireland criticized the judge for "merely slapping Terry on the wrist. Randy 
Terry has become a symbol of anti-abortion extremism at its worst. In light of 
this, he should have imposed a significant sentence because he (Terry) will 
continue to harass clinics and the women who are exercising their 
constitutional rights."

NUCLEAR WASTE EXPORT PLAN RAISES FEARS ABOUT ROUTE 
</P>

The Energy Department has quietly sold West Germany $20-million worth of highly 
radioactive cesium and strontium and is seeking to clear the way for its 
shipment from Hanford, Wash., to the Pacific Coast, then through the Panama 
Canal and across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first large-scale export of high-level nuclear waste material, 
and officials of the environmental activist organization Greenpeace said 
Thursday that they would attempt to block the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
The West German government arranged in 1984 to buy the 9.5 tons of waste from 
nuclear weapons production for use in experiments and tests of permanent 
nuclear waste storage in abandoned salt domes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Into Glass Logs 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department's Hanford operation has processed the waste, which emits 
twice as much gamma radiation as waste from commercial power reactors, into 
3-foot-long glass logs weighing 595 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement between the two governments, the waste material will be 
loaded into 27,500-pound shipping casks and turned over to the Germans at 
Hanford for shipment by a private contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans called for the first of three shipments to be made this fall, but 
officials with the Energy Department and the state governments of Oregon and 
Washington said that arrangements are unlikely to be completed until at least 
next spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trucked Through Gorge 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively, it is expected that the casks will be trucked from Hanford on 
Interstate 84 through the Columbia River gorge to the port of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Silver, special assistant to Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, said that 
state officials had been advised that the port of Seattle has not been ruled 
out as an alternative to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Oregon and Washington said that they are willing to approve 
shipment through their states if they are convinced that all safety precautions 
have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, "we have a long way to go," Silver said. "We are at the beginning of 
reviewing the documentation. We are very much in the preliminary stages. But 
there will be public hearings and people will have to be satisfied that this is 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Get Full Review 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department is expected to complete an environmental assessment 
report in November. And a department spokesman said that the shipment may 
require a full environmental impact statement, which would provide for public 
hearings and comment on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are obvious safety concerns, Silver said, "our position is that 
we must transport nuclear waste . . . to have a clean and safe environment, 
and, therefore, we need to establish procedures and the means to safely 
transport." 
</P>
<P>
Germany wanted the processed material to serve as heat sources that would 
simulate the waste generated by its own nuclear power reactors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salt Domes Considered 
</P>
<P>
In looking for ways to dispose of reactor waste, the United States earlier 
considered salt domes in Kansas as disposal sites because the heat from the 
radioactive material speeded the natural closure of mined salt deposits. That 
phenomenon held the promise of permanently and safely sealing away the waste 
material. 
</P>
<P>
But the salt domes fell from favor because of concerns about possible water 
penetration of the deposits, and the search turned elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sales agreement with Germany was concluded five years ago, the 
Energy Department did not contact local officials about transporting the 
material from Hanford to Germany until recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejects Barging 
</P>
<P>
Initially, officials were told, there was consideration of barging the casks 
down the Columbia River. But Edlow International, the firm hired by the Germans 
to handle the shipping, favored surface transportation. 
</P>
<P>
David Stewart-Smith of the Oregon Department of Transportation said that the 
company is now leaning toward shipment by truck rather than rail because it 
believes it would retain stronger control over a trucking company than a 
railroad.

Television evangelist Pat Robertson's 1988 campaign committee was turned down 
Thursday in a bid for an additional $675,000 in federal matching funds to help 
reimburse costs of his run for the Republican nomination for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Election Commission rejected an appeal by Americans for Robertson, 
which had resubmitted a request for matching funds that previously had been 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff had denied the request after reviewing a sample of 
contributions to be matched and determining they were not eligible for matching 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
In resubmitting its request, the Robertson committee asked the FEC to identify 
the sample contributions that had been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The committee maintained that, by correcting the errors that had made these 
contributions ineligible, it should be entitled to recover the value of its 
original submission, about $689,000.

IN SEATTLE BOOM, STRIKE AT BOEING IS 'JUST A BLIP'; 
</P>
<P>
AS WASHINGTON STATE'S ECONOMY DIVERSIFIES, FEW FEAR WALKOUT WILL TRIGGER 
'68-STYLE DEPRESSION

SEATTLE-When the Boeing Co. took a nose dive 20 years ago, Seattle pretty much 
went with it. Some wag even erected a billboard on the outskirts of town, 
asking the last one leaving to please turn out the lights. 
</P>
<P>
But growing Pacific Rim trade, tourism and a steady stream of disgruntled 
Californians have helped the Puget Sound diversify in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the projected $25-million-a-week dent Boeing's current strike will put in 
the state's economy is being referred to as "just a blip." 
</P>
<P>
And, although food banks are stocking up just in case, neither side is 
predicting a long or bitter struggle between the world's leading airplane 
manufacturer and its biggest union. 
</P>
<P>
About 57,000 members of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers continued their walkout for a second day Thursday with no new talks 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overtime Issue 
</P>
<P>
The strikers, who make up the bulk of Boeing's blue-collar work force, are 
demanding their first pay hike in six years and a sharp reduction or 
abolishment of mandatory overtime, which is currently 200 hours a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
They rejected Boeing's last offer, which would have increased salaries 4% this 
year and 3% in 1990 and 1991. Overtime would have been cut to 160 hours a 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz Thursday apologized in a telegram to Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney for any delays the strike might cause in delivery. Boeing 
manufactures structural components for the B-2 bomber and other military 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
The walkout is the latest and biggest in a rash of strikes to hit Seattle in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of grocery workers, nurses and carpenters also have walked the picket 
lines during what turned out to be a summer of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"People are mad," said Karen Keiser, spokeswoman for the Washington State Labor 
Council, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very patient and very accommodating for a decade when the economy 
was bad," she said. "There were a lot of concessions -- wage freezes, giveaways 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Well, now the economy is booming and people feel it's their turn, that it's 
time to make up what they gave up." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing is in its fifth straight year of record sales and employment, and it 
accounts either directly or indirectly for an estimated one-third of the 
500,000 jobs the state has created since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
It is the state's leading manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
And, although most agree that the company clearly still drives the region's 
economy, what it drives amounts to more of a stretch limousine these days than 
a Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the No. 1 factor in the region's economy," said Boeing spokesman Harold 
Carr, "but the general perception is that the area is less dependent on us than 
it was 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Industries 
</P>
<P>
Port activity, downtown development, biomedical technology, software 
manufacturing and tourism all have helped make Seattle "a world-class city," 
said economist Dennis Fusco. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all waiting to see the impact of the strike," said Fusco, chief 
economist for the State Employment Security Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends entirely on the duration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace industry is enjoying record prosperity, and the Puget Sound area 
remains its capital. Economists don't fear a rerun of what became known around 
here as the Great Boeing Depression of 1968-71. The infamous billboard went up, 
and there were stories of Boeing engineers driving cabs to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing laid off half its work force then, and the region had yet to build an 
economic cushion of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is booming now," Fusco said, "not just Boeing." 
</P>
<P>
"The strike, within one or two months, represents just a blip in our economy," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just grown up." 
</P>
<P>
At the AFL-CIO, Karen Keiser predicted it would take only "a week" for the 
strike's impact to be felt. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, these people are consumers. We're not talking about people who sock 
it away on mutual funds and bonds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're buying refrigerators and houses and school clothes." 
</P>
<P>
On the picket lines, many workers agreed that the short-term strike they expect 
would have minimal impact on the region's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is helping us right now," said Robert Kazen, a maintenance man for 
11 years at Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my creditors have already agreed to let me just make interest 
payments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll last a couple of weeks maybe," said Skip Buckner, a 10-year 
Boeing veteran manning a picket line outside the company's giant 747 factory in 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7-Day Weeks 
</P>
<P>
"I earned this time off and I want it," he said. "For 2 1/2 years, I worked 
12-hour days, seven days a week. You know how I spent my vacation? 
</P>
<P>
"Flat on my back in bed with pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
Keiser said all Puget Sound labor leaders plan to meet Monday "for some fairly 
high-level strategizing." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the machinists have not asked for any sympathy strikes. Fellow unions 
at Boeing are bound by no-strike clauses which would prevent such a show of 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Although Carr said "very close to 100%" of the union members stayed off the 
job, some strikers who entered the plant to pick up their tool boxes seemed 
surprised by the amount of activity inside. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people working," one striker bitterly told friends on the 
picket line as he came out with his tool box. "Not just supervisors, either." 
</P>
<P>
With an $80-billion backlog of 1,603 planes on order, Boeing commands 60% of 
the world market and has enough work to keep its assembly lines busy 
around-the-clock for five years, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Although supervisors and other non-union workers can fill in to some degree, 
Carr admitted it was "highly unlikely" that a plane could be built 
start-to-finish under current circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing faced penalties last year for late deliveries to airlines, but Carr said 
contracts can be renegotiated and such fines avoided during labor disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing faced penalties from two other sources Thursday -- the state Department 
of Labor and Industries and the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The state said it has penalized Boeing $128,780 for 36 alleged violations, the 
largest penalty ever proposed against a Washington State employer under the 
state's Industrial Safety and Health Act. OSHA announced citations against 
Boeing for 40 violations that carry penalties totaling $41,530. 
</P>
<P>
The citations were primarily focused on Boeing Advanced Systems operations at 
the Developmental Center in Seattle, where parts for the B-2 bomber are made. 
</P>
<P>
Of the state's 36 alleged violations, 19 were related to safety and 17 to 
hygiene.

CUNLIFFE WHISTLE-BLOWER SUIT SETTLED BY CITY FOR $800,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tentative $800,000 settlement has been reached in a lawsuit by a 
"whistle-blower" against the city and Sylvia Cunliffe, the fiery department 
head forced from office in a wave of scandal, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by Robert O'Neill accused Cunliffe of defamation, invasion of 
privacy and infliction of intentional and negligent emotional distress because 
of Cunliffe's distribution of a letter in June, 1987, detailing his criminal 
record as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Cunliffe, the former head of the Department of General Services, obtained the 
information about O'Neill's past through department security officers and 
circulated the letter to council members and Mayor Tom Bradley, allegedly in 
retaliation for O'Neill's having blown the whistle on certain of her 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill's attorney, Jay Plotkin, and Deputy City Atty. Art Walsh said the 
settlement was approved Monday in Superior Court and must still be endorsed by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very debilitating and emotionally draining experience for my 
client," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the letter was circulated by a top-level city official, the city itself 
was named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The city agreed to pay both Cunliffe's 
share of damages and legal fees in a negotiated agreement under which Cunliffe 
retired in December, 1987, forestalling plans to fire her amid allegations of 
mismanagement, nepotism and favoritism.

CUNLIFFE WHISTLE-BLOWER SETTLES CITY SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
AGREES TO $800,000 AWARD; COUNCIL'S APPROVAL STILL REQUIRED

<P>
Whistle-blower Robert O'Neill, a key figure in the forced retirement of Sylvia 
Cunliffe as general manager of Los Angeles' General Services Department last 
year, has agreed to an $800,000 settlement of his lawsuit against the city, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Art Walsh said the city and O'Neill, 48, a real estate 
officer in Cunliffe's department, appeared before Superior Court Judge Bruce R. 
Geehnaert on Monday to place the agreement on record. The settlement still must 
be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"All parties are satisfied," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill's lawyer, Jay Plotkin, told United Press International that O'Neill 
felt both "relieved" and "vindicated" by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Before filing suit, O'Neill had made several anonymous telephone calls on a 
city corruption hot line, accusing Cunliffe of improprieties. He charged that, 
in retaliation, Cunliffe tried to discredit him by revealing his youthful 
troubles with the law. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to Mayor Tom Bradley and the City Council, Cunliffe said that 
criminal records showed that O'Neill had been convicted of misdemeanors in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s in Connecticut, had had an alcohol problem and was 
"a known gambler." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley subsequently charged that O'Neill's privacy had been violated. Cunliffe 
had "falsely implied that Mr. O'Neill was dishonest and had never rehabilitated 
himself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite clear that her purpose in sending the memoranda was as an act of 
reprisal against Mr. O'Neil," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor urged Cunliffe's firing because of allegations that she had hired her 
mother and other relatives, favored friends in granting of contracts, rented 
city-owned property and invaded O'Neill's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy ended when Cunliffe, then 54, agreed to retire with full 
pension benefits on March 4, 1988, her birthday. The agreement, approved by the 
City Council after a half-hour debate, spared Cunliffe from possibly being 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agreed to pay Cunliffe's share of damages and legal fees. As a 
result, the settlement announced Thursday provided that O'Neill drop his case 
against his former boss as well as the city.

YALE, SWARTHMORE RANKED NO. 1 BY NEWS MAGAZINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yale University and Swarthmore College were named America's best undergraduate 
schools for the second straight year, according to U.S. News and World Report 
rankings released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Yale was tabbed as best national university in the third annual assessment by 
the magazine, followed by Princeton, Harvard, Caltech, Duke and Stanford. 
Swarthmore won honors as best national liberal arts college, ahead of Amherst, 
Williams, Pomona, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the top schools were the alma maters of the 1988 presidential 
candidates -- George Bush graduated from Yale and Michael Dukakis received his 
undergraduate degree from Swarthmore. 
</P>
<P>
In new categories, Harvey Mudd College, which along with Pomona College is part 
of the Claremont Colleges, was tabbed as the best school specializing in 
engineering and Babson College in Massachusetts won honors as the best business 
speciality school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC System 
</P>
<P>
In the national university category, the UC system did well. UC Berkeley was 
ranked 13th and UCLA 16th. Plus, UC San Diego was included in a list of 
"up-and-coming" schools selected by college presidents and administrators, 
along with Arizona State, Carnegie-Mellon, Emory, Rutgers and the University of 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State was named as one of the rising regional colleges and 
universities in the West, as were University of Nevada at Las Vegas and Western 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
The schools were ranked on the basis of five categories: quality of student 
body -- based on SAT scores and the ratio of students accepted to total 
applicants, faculty quality, academic reputation, financial resources and 
ability to retain and graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said it used statistical measures for each category except 
academic reputation, which was determined by polling college presidents, deans 
of academic affairs and deans of admissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Colleges 
</P>
<P>
The best regional university or college in the West was Trinity in Texas, the 
poll said, followed by University of Redlands, Santa Clara University, Loyola 
Marymount University in Los Angeles, University of San Diego, San Francisco 
State, Whittier College, University of Puget Sound, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
University of the Pacific in Stockton, University of Portland, Humboldt State, 
Cal State Fresno, Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash., and Cal State 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list for best regional liberal arts colleges were Southwestern 
University in Texas, Evergreen State College in Washington, Pacific University 
in Oregon, Mt. St. Mary's College in Los Angeles and Texas Lutheran College. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 204 national universities, Yale won top honors even though it did not 
finish first in any of the five specific categories. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard came in first for academic reputation and student selectivity, while 
Brown won top honors for student retention, Caltech for faculty quality and 
Princeton for financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TOP 25 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked the schools based on quality of student 
body and faculty, financial resources, ability to retain and to graduate 
students and reputation for academic excellence. Statistical measures and a 
survey of college leaders were used in determining the rankings.

SHARE-THE-RIDE DAY SPEEDS RUSH-HOUR TRAFFIC BY 7 M.P.H. -- WHICH IS BETTER THAN 
IT SOUNDS

Motorists on some of the Los Angeles area's most crowded freeways zipped to 
work at up to 7 m.p.h. faster on Thursday as an estimated 43,000 commuters 
pledged not to ride solo as part of the state's "Keep California Moving Day," 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the top average speed in rush-hour traffic between 7:30 and 9 a.m. 
reached only 38 m.p.h. (that was on the southbound Harbor Freeway), the 
increase was seen as significant because participants represented "barely a 
dent" among the Southland's commuters, said Michelle Perrault, chairwoman of 
the weeklong car-pooling campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Commutes were slowest on the westbound Pomona Freeway, where the increase in 
average speed was 4 m.p.h. and drivers crept along at an average 13 to 18 
m.p.h., according to Steve Parks, spokesman for Commuter Computer, a 
ride-sharing group that helped promote the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
State transportation officials determined the increases by recording Thursday's 
speeds and comparing averages against existing figures. 
</P>
<P>
Perrault said the campaign was designed to showcase commuting alternatives, 
such as car pooling once a week and encouraging employers to reduce employee 
driving times by adopting a four-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
Just after the morning rush hour ended, a truck dropped a load of caustic 
concrete mix on the Pomona Freeway near Hacienda Boulevard, blocking traffic 
until about 2:40 p.m., the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
While traffic was backed up, a 28-year-old San Diego man, Gregory Michael 
Smith, tried to speed through roadblocks and crashed into a guardrail. Smith 
was arrested on charges of reckless driving, car theft and other offenses.

MINORITIES, DRUG USERS TARGETS OF AIDS RESEARCH 
</P>

Federal health officials, in an "outreach" attempt to make AIDS clinical 
research accessible to minorities, women and intravenous drug abusers, Thursday 
announced $9 million in contracts to AIDS community-based programs in 14 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We look upon this as science at the community level," said federal AIDS chief 
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Fauci said at a press conference that the programs are intended to produce 
valid scientific data from "non-traditional" sources. He said that they will 
draw on the expertise of health workers in local clinics and other facilities 
already treating AIDS patients. The hope, he said, is to include AIDS patients 
previously under-represented in traditional studies typically carried out at 
large academic medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
"As (AIDS) infection has spread among blacks, Hispanics, intravenous drug 
users, women and children, we at the NIAID have felt a particular urgency to 
reach out to people in these groups and offer them the opportunity to 
participate in clinical research," Fauci said. 
</P>
<P>
But some groups were angry that they did not receive grants funding their 
proposals. The New York-based Community Research Initiative, which is 
considered a pioneer, was one of the groups whose proposal was not funded. CRI, 
along with the County Community Consortium of San Francisco, contributed data 
that led to the recent federal approval of aerosol pentamidine to prevent 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a life-threatening AIDS infection. The 
consortium, however, did receive a grant. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Callen, president of CRI, complained that his group's exclusion was a 
"politically motivated slap," by NIAID. But he said that his program "will 
survive without NIAID funding." 
</P>
<P>
The American Foundation for AIDS Research criticized the selections as programs 
that were "not truly community-based." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different definition of community-based clinical research," said 
David Corkery, a spokesman for AMFAR. "Many of the groups that were funded were 
either university-based, or hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Fauci said that the programs were chosen by "peer-review" committees composed 
of community clinicians, nurses, social workers, researchers, people infected 
with human immunodeficiency virus and "representatives of the groups now 
under-represented in clinical trials." The committees "scored" the proposals, 
and those with the highest scores were selected. The contracts are for five 
years, with $9 million funded for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Jean McGuire of the AIDS Action Council, who sat on one review committee, said 
that she was not involved in evaluating CRI's proposal but said that the review 
process was "rigorous and equitable" but "there just wasn't enough money to go 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Fauci admitted he was surprised that CRI was not selected, so much so that he 
called a special staff meeting to find out why. "I was very concerned. . . . I 
would have liked to see CRI get funded, I really would have. But I saw their 
score clearly put them out of the fundable range." He said he could not 
publicly disclose the reasons for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Neil Schram, a Harbor City, Calif., physician who heads the AIDS task force 
for the American Assn. of Physicians for Human Rights, decried the lack of 
funding for other gay-identified groups in addition to CRI, such as the 
Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington and the Fenway Health Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea behind community-based research is to involve the doctors on 
the front lines," he said. Gay doctors "are where the patients are and where 
the experience is," he added. 
</P>
<P>
No Los Angeles programs were funded.

<P>
President Bush will undergo a minor operation today to remove a cyst on the 
middle finger of his right hand, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "clinical observation" by the President's physicians 
indicated that the mucoid cyst is benign. Although a biopsy will be performed 
on the tissue after it is removed, mucus-filled sacs, by definition, are not 
malignant, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery, which Bush called "a little tiny operation," will be performed at 
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington under a local anesthetic that 
numbs the entire finger. Fitzwater said that while the growth has been present 
for three years, "it simply has reached a point where it has gotten larger and 
noticeable in (the President's) daily activities, and so he'd like to have it 
removed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Causes Some Anxiety 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really painful, but it's a nuisance in the sense that it is large 
enough to cause him some anxiety," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the procedure as routine, and said that it would be performed at 
the hospital rather than in the White House physician's office, because "it 
does require anesthetic, it requires an incision . . . and it will require 
stitches." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, "you never know . . . what it takes to get it out of there 
once you get in." 
</P>
<P>
The cyst is positioned between the fingernail and the upper joint. Bush is 
expected to be in and out of the hospital within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The location of the growth was the subject of good-natured teasing Thursday 
when Bush posed for photographs at the start of a meeting with Jonas Savimbi, a 
leader of the Angolan resistance group, UNITA. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked him to "show us which one hurts," the President laughed 
and replied: "Don't tempt me! Come on, it is this finger -- this middle one." 
</P>
<P>
He then pointed his ailing finger downward. 
</P>
<P>
"This finger is sometimes identified with a bad gesture in the United States," 
he explained to Savimbi. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also joked that "I have to undergo a serious operation. I will show you my 
scar afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
The procedure to remove the cyst commonly involves making an incision, 
spreading the skin around the growth, tying the sac at its roots in the joint, 
snipping it off and then sewing up the incision, according to Dr. John Reeves, 
a dermatologist at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Other, less invasive, treatments involve draining the sac and injecting 
cortisone, or giving the patient sterile needles to drain the sac himself 
several times over a period of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said that the growth, which occurs more often in older people, is rarely 
painful, although it can sometimes produce pressure or discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery will be performed by Dr. Allen Smith, a colonel in the Army Medical 
Corps and chief of hand surgery at Walter Reed, and by Dr. George Bogumill, 
chief of hand surgery at Georgetown University Hospital. The anesthetic will be 
administered by Dr. Charles Gandy, an Army lieutenant colonel stationed at 
Walter Reed. 
</P>
<P>
After the surgery, Bush plans to fly by helicopter to Camp David, Md., for the 
three-day Columbus Day holiday. On Sunday, he will leave the presidential 
retreat to speak to the National Federation of Republican Women, meeting in 
Baltimore.

A few hundred homeless marchers wrapped themselves in blankets on a stadium 
parking lot Thursday night as their leaders complained that the demonstrators 
arriving in the capital did not have an adequate place to sleep or use the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Activists blamed the National Union of the Homeless, which organized the 
gathering, for failing to provide adequate facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The conditions there are awful," said activist John Steinbruck. 
</P>
<P>
The group planned an early morning march to the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development today to protest the plight of the homeless.

TERRORISM EXPERT LEAVES RAND TO JOIN FIRM THAT PROBES CORPORATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a Green Beret captain in Vietnam, Brian Jenkins developed an understandable 
interest in guerrilla warfare. But when he returned to the United States in 
1968 as a consultant for RAND Corp., he found himself wondering whether a new 
tactic would become an accepted form of warfare -- terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins began recording the occasional political kidnaping or hijacking on 
3-by-5 index cards and wrote memos at RAND, the Santa Monica-based "think 
tank," warning of a possible trend to come. He got no response. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1972 terrorists slaughtered 25 people at Lod Airport in Israel and a 
dozen more at the Munich Olympics. In the United States, a Cabinet-level 
committee was formed to combat terrorism. Within weeks, the government 
discovered Jenkins' memos. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he was working full time at RAND, preparing policy recommendations for 
Washington and scrapping the index cards for a computer, quickly becoming one 
of the foremost experts on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
But after two decades, Jenkins is leaving behind his computer -- with 7,000 
terrorist incidents logged in its memory bank. He is departing RAND to pursue a 
new interest: corporate crime. 
</P>
<P>
Shedding the khakis-and-sneakers informality of RAND for a blue suit -- or what 
he used to call "going-to-Washington clothes" -- Jenkins began work this week 
at the downtown Los Angeles offices of Kroll Associates, the nation's leading 
corporate investigations firm. Once dubbed "Wall Street's private eye," the New 
York-based Kroll is best known for its high-priced work digging into the 
background of corporate raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Jenkins, who has been named a managing partner at Kroll, said 
he will not be doing that type of snooping but will concentrate on 
product-tampering cases, terrorism against corporations and "information 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm moving on to a different sort of villain," he said. "Some throw bombs, 
others have Swiss bank accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jenkins will still do some consulting with RAND on government 
contracts, he said he had gotten "a little too comfortable" as the chief 
in-house expert on terrorism; he could not see himself writing "another 200 
reports" on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
Rising to chairman of RAND's political science department, Jenkins became one 
of the think tank's highest-profile people, a fixture on network newscasts 
whenever there was a terrorist act. 
</P>
<P>
His opinions were elicited by journalists on such varied questions as how Iran 
was likely to respond to U.S. bombing of an offshore oil platform to the impact 
of terrorist bombings on Paris fashion shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian, in a sense, established the idea that you could do policy research on 
terrorism," said RAND President James A. Thomson. "He quickly became a national 
spokesman. A high profile is not something we would expect every staff member 
to have, but there are certain issues where the client is as much the American 
people as the government." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Field Manual for Hostages' 
</P>
<P>
One of Jenkins' early projects was to prepare a "field manual for hostages," 
material to alert diplomats to conditions they would face if seized by 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
He interviewed former hostages around the world and pondered the strange 
process by which they often came to identify with -- "even fall in love with" 
-- the terrorists who held them. He concluded that this was a natural human 
reaction and should not be condemned. He recommended that released hostages not 
be thrust immediately before the cameras because they needed time to reflect on 
their experience. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jenkins acted as a consultant to Catholic Relief Services 
after Father Lawrence M. Jenko was abducted in Beirut. He helped steer the 
group away from a series of con men who claimed to have Lebanese connections 
who could secure Jenko's release for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his combat background and rugged, square-jawed looks, Jenkins has been 
a voice of moderation. 
</P>
<P>
For years, he challenged those who claimed that the Soviet Union was the 
mastermind behind all anti-Western political violence, saying that such an 
approach to terrorism "underestimates its depths, its extent and its danger." 
Recently, he has participated in U.S. talks with the Soviet Union aimed at 
cooperation in combating terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Surgical Strike' 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said his war experiences made him intolerant of people who propose 
military force but describe it with antiseptic terms such as "surgical strike." 
</P>
<P>
"I always ask them, 'Are you talking about killing people?' Because what it 
comes down to is killing people and destroying things." 
</P>
<P>
When top government officials ask him to comment on drafts of their speeches, 
Jenkins said, he spends his first 20 minutes crossing out bellicose language 
denouncing the atrocities and threats that sound like the "swagger of 
professional wrestlers." 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, 'Take it as a given that people see this is an atrocity.' " 
</P>
<P>
All the pounding on the table only seems silly, he explained, when the speech 
almost invariably concludes with the whimper of, "Therefore, we recommend 
economic sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, such efforts at editing are not always accepted by government 
officials who are enraged and frustrated by acts of terrorism. "I cross it 
out," he said, "and it gets back in." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins has received periodic feelers about taking government jobs but has 
always resisted, considering himself "too much of a West Coast maverick" to 
survive in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd have a hard time in government . . . conforming to a line if he didn't 
agree with it," said RAND's Thomson, a former staff member of the National 
Security Council. "He'd be fired," he added with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But Jenkins has done some corporate consulting over the years, and his 
specialty drew his attention to a series of product-tampering cases ranging 
from poison-filled Tylenol capsules in the United States to threats to taint 
tea from Sri Lanka and fruit from South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Dark Side' 
</P>
<P>
Although such incidents often have been the work of crackpots or simple 
extortionists, "that's how hijackings started," he noted. "I tend to look at 
that and say, 'What do villains do with that? What's the dark side of that?' " 
</P>
<P>
The recent poisoning of grapes from Chile illustrated the dark possibilities, 
he said. "Two poison grapes -- $100 million economic damage." 
</P>
<P>
At Kroll Associates, Jenkins said, he has been given freedom to explore the 
danger of "commercial fraud on a grand international scale" and such crimes as 
the theft of secrets and computer sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1972 by a former Manhattan prosecutor, Kroll has offices in London, 
Hong Kong, San Francisco and several other cities. The firm, which handled more 
than 1,000 investigations last year, is often called on in takeover deals. 
</P>
<P>
Kroll was also hired to help the defense of Drexel Burnham Lambert and indicted 
"junk bond" wizard Michael Milken to discredit jailed stock speculator Ivan F. 
Boesky, who is expected to testify for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing Jenkins' arrival, Kroll said the RAND expert will 
"expand our global capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Still trying to figure out how to unlock the door to his new office, Jenkins 
admitted this week to feeling a bit out of place in a downtown high-rise 
"surrounded by guys who read the Wall Street Journal and who know what soybeans 
are doing." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little scary," he said. " . . . I am now where I was in 1970 with 
terrorism. I've got the notion of a new universe. I just don't have a map of it 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
To help him, he has arranged for a RAND computer expert to help him part time 
in the corporate post. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make some new databases," he said. "We'll probably start with 
3-by-5 cards."

BILL BOYARSKY: A LESSON IN THE POLITICS OF POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was easy to see that Alan Robbins was plotting. He was biting his lower lip 
and his eyes were narrowed, warning signs that the state senator was engaged in 
serious business. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, a Democrat representing a conservative area of the San Fernando 
Valley, was trying to revive a bill that meant much to him as the Legislature 
moved toward adjournment. But he faced an obstacle, a fundamental rule of 
politics: Power comes from the alliances you build, the friendships you make, 
and the favors you do over a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, his obstacle was Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, who was trying to 
defeat Robbins' bill. Her intensity was apparent from the way she confronted 
Assemblyman Richard Katz on the Assembly floor and dragged him over to a 
meeting with Speaker Willie Brown. As usual, she was combative, ready to work 
out a deal with Brown after defying him on an issue a few minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Waters could do that because she was one of the handful of people who got Brown 
elected Speaker several years ago. Since then, she has helped save his 
speakership from frequent assaults and is one of the few whose advice he 
trusts. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, on the other hand, operates without long-term allies. He is the 
ultimate legislative loner -- smart, tough, crafty, keeping his plans to 
himself. Because of those qualities, colleagues are wary. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was a piece of legislation known as "The Bill That Won't Die," or 
"The Freddie Krueger Bill," after the man they couldn't kill in "Nightmare on 
Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
The measure had been defeated or vetoed in past sessions, but always was 
revived. In fact, it had just been killed -- some thought -- two weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would eliminate the Southern California Rapid Transit District and set 
up a super agency to run transit. Robbins has long maintained that the RTD is 
poorly run and has not served his suburban constituents well. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' district is in South Los Angeles, in the predominantly black area south 
of the Santa Monica Freeway. This is an urban, liberal, Democratic area. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether it's good or bad to reorganize the transit district 
didn't really concern Waters. What worried her was the RTD bus drivers, many of 
whom are black residents of South Los Angeles. To South LA, the RTD is a great 
source of steady, well-paying jobs, and Waters did not want anyone messing with 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Suburbanites dominate the Los Angeles County legislative delegation. Republican 
Gov. George Deukmejian is sympathetic to them. On this day, the word from the 
Robbins camp was that the senator was gaining support. 
</P>
<P>
With constituents' jobs at stake, Waters wanted to see the bill defeated. There 
was no one else to do it. She constitutes just about all the political 
influence South Los Angeles has in the Legislature. Political, personal and 
legal troubles have weakened her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Nor would there be much help from city officials. The RTD, with two board 
members nervously waiting amid a crowd of lobbyists outside the legislative 
chambers, were counting on Waters. 
</P>
<P>
At midday, Robbins felt he had breathed enough life into the bill to bring it 
before the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Waters began to fight. At 3:15 p.m. on the Assembly floor, she talked to Katz, 
a sometimes Robbins ally and chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
and John Vasconcellos, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. She asked Katz 
if he was part of the anti-RTD move. "He assured me he was not," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
The three of them got together on the Assembly floor with Speaker Brown. A 
strategy was arranged. The bill would be killed in the Ways and Means 
Committee. At 6 p.m., it was dead. "I don't see enough votes on my committee to 
pass it," said Vasconcellos. "So I won't bring it up." 
</P>
<P>
The swift and deadly blow was a graphic example of how political power in Los 
Angeles depends on alliances in Sacramento. How much power does Maxine Waters 
have? As much as she can obtain from her alliance with the Speaker. If Brown 
goes, so goes her power. 
</P>
<P>
Such power is tenuous, and that's what troubles urban political leaders 
competing against the suburbs. Robbins, of course, will be back next year with 
the same bill. He never gives up. That's the real lesson in political science.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCOMPLICE GUILTY IN OFFICER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the participants in a bungled armed robbery in Inglewood last year that 
led to the shooting death of an Inglewood police sergeant has been convicted of 
first-degree murder in Torrance Superior Court. A separate jury continued 
deliberations Thursday in the case of one of his alleged accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
A jury on Wednesday found Van Otis Wilson, 22, responsible for Sgt. George 
Aguilar's death even though police accused another man, Leslie Holget, of 
pulling the trigger. Police said Holget killed himself hours after Aguilar's 
death as officers moved in to arrest him after a 45-mile chase. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson will be sentenced by Superior Court Judge John P. Shook Oct. 27. He 
faces 25 years to life in prison for murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deliberations continued in the case of Joevone Elster, 23, who is 
charged with murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Another alleged accomplice pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange 
for his testimony against Wilson and Elster. The fifth participant was 
sentenced to the California Youth Authority for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors accused Elster of planning the five-man robbery of a gas station 
money courier. Aguilar, an undercover narcotics officer, spotted the robbery 
and was chasing one of the three getaway cars when he was shot.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HONESTY'S ITS OWN REWARD -- AND MAYBE MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Honesty is its own reward, that's true. But for a Torrance resident who turned 
over to police more than $24,000 in suspected drug money that he found on the 
street, the reward may be a bit more substantial. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Traber said Terrance Walker found the money near his car as he was on 
his way to work Thursday. He spotted a container, looked inside, found the loot 
and notified police. 
</P>
<P>
Traber said police feel there is a "very good likelihood" that the money was 
part of a drug deal. "We brought in a dog trained to detect narcotics," he 
said, and the dog reacted to the package. "What that suggests to us is, whoever 
handled the money also handled drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen to the money, Traber said he would like to see Walker 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fantastic when you have somebody in the community who's honest enough 
to turn in a large sum of money," said Traber. "It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Walker could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities will hang onto the cash for at least 120 days, in case the rightful 
owner shows up. But, given suspicions that drugs are involved, Traber said he 
did not think the owner would show up any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see anybody coming up and saying, 'Oh yes, I'm a dope dealer and 
that's my money.' "

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CANDIDATE ACCUSED OF ILLEGAL MAILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission has accused Republican state Senate 
candidate Don Knabe of sending an illegal campaign piece to 400 disabled 
veterans in his unsuccessful 1988 bid to defeat Sen. Cecil N. Green 
(D-Norwalk). 
</P>
<P>
In the final weeks of the campaign, Knabe, a former Cerritos city councilman 
and chief deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, sent out a 
letter by a past national commander of American Disabled Veterans, Sherman E. 
Roodzant. The mailer attacked Green for "callous misuse of the American flag" 
and "blatant disregard for America's veterans." 
</P>
<P>
The letter itself indicated in small type that the mailing was paid for by 
Knabe's campaign, but the law requires full identification of the sender on the 
envelope as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised at the tenacity (of the commission) over 400 envelopes," said 
Knabe, who blamed the problem on a printer's oversight. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission upholds the charge, Knabe could be fined $2,000.

A mother and daughter pleaded no contest Thursday in South Bay Municipal Court 
to a charge that they did not have a license to operate a day-care center at 
their Lomita home, where a 16-month-old girl died last year. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the plea, Judge Gary Daigh sentenced Linda Zieger, 48, to 20 
days in County Jail, three years' probation and a $1,000 fine. Zieger's 
daughter, Laura, 20, was placed on three years' probation and fined $500. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's horrible," said Josie Heasley, whose daughter, Michele, died at 
the Ziegers. "These people should have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considering Suing 
</P>
<P>
Heasley and her husband, John, said they are still considering suing the 
Ziegers for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's sentencing brought to a quiet close a criminal case that began 
nearly a year ago with a week of sensational revelations. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies reported on Nov. 14 that Michele Heasley had died at the 
Ziegers' home on West 262nd Street. A day later, a coroner's autopsy found that 
the girl had been strangled to death and sexually assaulted. Sheriff's 
investigators said someone had wrapped a cord at least twice around the child's 
neck. Linda Zieger, her husband, Robert, and their daughter, Laura, were 
charged with felony child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
A week after the death, sheriff's officials said medical examinations uncovered 
evidence of sexual molestation of two other infants cared for at the home. 
There was no evidence to suggest who had molested the children or where the 
molestations occurred, the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case Fell Apart 
</P>
<P>
From that point, the case began to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
A supplementary autopsy report concluded that the initial finding of 
molestation was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the felony child endangerment charges against the Ziegers were 
dismissed after a preliminary hearing before South Bay Municipal Judge Thomas 
P. Allen Jr. The judge ruled that the Ziegers were not criminally negligent and 
that the girl's death appeared to be the result of inattention or poor 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Allen also dismissed misdemeanor licensing charges against Robert Zieger, 
saying he had not operated the day care center. 
</P>
<P>
That left only misdemeanor licensing charges against Linda and Laura Zieger. 
That charge carries a maximum six-month jail sentence, in contrast to the six 
years in state prison that can follow a felony conviction on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said they were unable to determine who wrapped the cord 
around Michele Heasley's neck. The Sheriff's Department never established any 
connection between the Ziegers and the other two children who allegedly were 
molested. That portion of the investigation was disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
After Thursday's pleas, Deputy Dist. Atty. Rod Leonard said he no longer 
believes that the girl was murdered. He theorized that she strangled 
accidentally after becoming entangled in a harness that the Ziegers allegedly 
used to restrain children.

LAWNDALE NEWSLETTER CREATES STIR WITH SCHOOL ITEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some parents, students and administrators from the Centinela Valley Union High 
School District have attacked a Lawndale neighborhood-watch newsletter, saying 
the city-financed publication was used to promote a candidate for the upcoming 
school board election. 
</P>
<P>
The Burin Avenue Neighborhood Watch Newsletter, which was printed at City Hall 
by the city's neighborhood watch coordinator, was "immoral, unethical and 
reprehensible," said Leuzinger High School Principal Sonja Davis. 
</P>
<P>
She, along with others, criticized the newsletter during last month's school 
board meeting, saying it represented a misuse of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appalled' by Politics 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Rhodes, whose two sons graduated from Leuzinger, told the board: "I am 
appalled that politics have become part of the city of Lawndale's Neighborhood 
Watch Program." 
</P>
<P>
The criticisms refer to an item in the September newsletter that said: "Many 
members of the Lawndale Neighborhood Watch have expressed concern about gang 
activity on the campus of Leuzinger High School. Some members have also 
expressed their feelings that the present board does not admit the problem and 
has not taken steps to deal with gang activity at Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be an election for school board members on Nov. 7. Pam Sturgeon is 
a candidate for the board. Her telephone number is . . . and she would like to 
talk to anyone who has questions or concerns." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 150 copies of the newsletter were printed, and about 80 have been 
distributed throughout the Burin Avenue area in downtown Lawndale, according to 
members of the neighborhood group. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy McKee, the city's neighborhood watch coordinator, said, "I don't see what 
the big deal is." 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter was written by Jane Cushman, the Burin Avenue watch captain, and 
was not reviewed before publication, McKee said. "I don't feel I was hired to 
be a censor for my block captains," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing the matter with the assistant city manager, McKee said, she 
has advised all watch captains that newsletters funded by the city cannot 
promote candidates running for public office. "I'll be looking at (the 
newsletters) from now on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Cushman defended the newsletter, saying that it was 
impartial and did not promote Sturgeon's candidacy. "I am not aware that a law 
was violated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman, who has written the monthly publication for more than a year, said the 
newsletter was only a report of what other watch captains told her during a 
neighborhood watch meeting. 
</P>
<P>
She called the controversy "a tempest in a teapot." 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon, who chairs the city Planning Commission and is president of the 
Lawndale Chamber of Commerce, said she knew before its publication that the 
newsletter would mention her candidacy but did not realize that it was funded 
by the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Not Mentioned 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that the newsletter should have mentioned the names of the 
other candidates but added: "I have no problems with it." 
</P>
<P>
The letter does not mention Ann Birdsall, the incumbent whose District 1 seat 
Sturgeon is seeking. There are no other candidates for the District 1 seat. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the comments in the newsletter, Birdsall said: "I try to stay out 
of politics as much as possible . . . (but) I don't like it, and I'm very 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
She said city funds should not have been used to pay for a newsletter that 
mentioned only one candidate. In addition, Birdsall said gang problems at 
Leuzinger were exaggerated in the newsletter. "I'm very angry that Leuzinger 
has been slandered again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Marthens a Lawndale resident and community activist, has asked the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Lapin, the district attorney's acting head of special investigations, 
said he was notified about the newsletter last week. Lapin said his office will 
review the allegations and will decide within two weeks whether to order a full 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale City Atty. David Aleshire said the newsletter may represent a 
violation of Proposition 73, a campaign reform initiative passed by voters in 
November, 1988. The law prohibits the use of public funds to pay for 
newsletters or mass mailings for candidates running for elected offices. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties for violating Proposition 73 include a fine of up to $2,000, 
levied by the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, if (a newsletter) is put out at city expense it cannot be an election 
vehicle for a school board election or city election," Aleshire said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he read the newsletter and it "did not make me happy," but that he 
does not intend to pursue the matter unless the City Council requests an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cast in Bad Light 
</P>
<P>
Some people are troubled by the newsletter because, they said, it painted the 
school in a bad light. 
</P>
<P>
Mike O'Hara a deputy with the Lennox Sheriff's Department gang detail, said 
there are very few gang problems at Leuzinger because of vigilant school 
security officers and routine patrols by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"We rarely get major incidents" such as shootings or robberies at Leuzinger, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara said the school may be relatively free of gang problems because gangs 
consider the campus neutral territory. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman said she wrote the newsletter without personal knowledge of a gang 
problems at the school but was simply reporting what she had been told by other 
watch captains. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone wants to say there is no gang activity at Leuzinger, then I will 
print that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Control 
</P>
<P>
Davis said there are gang members who attend Leuzinger but insists that 
administrators have been able to keep violence off the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very careful to secure the campus to keep outsiders outside. . . . We 
have not had a knifing. We have not had any shootings on the campus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Johnson, a 14-year-old sophomore at Leuzinger, said students and 
administrators there have long been fighting the image that Leuzinger is 
plagued by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset because I have been fighting this battle too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who spoke during the school board meeting, said in an interview: "As 
far as I can see, there is no gang-related activity."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CURB-SIDE RECYCLING TO START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curb-side recycling of newspapers and metal and glass containers will begin 
Dec. 4 in Manhattan Beach under a plan unanimously approved Tuesday by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
California Conservation Corps workers will fan out throughout the city on Nov. 
13 to distribute a 14-gallon container to each household, according to David 
Ludwig, who is in charge of the program for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Residents can toss all recyclable goods into the one container, which will be 
emptied the same day their other trash is picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig said the program will initially cost each household 70 cents a month. 
However, if more than 50% of the city's residents participate in the program, 
the charge will drop to 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to spend $1,000 a month to publicize the program, according to 
Ludwig. To further promote the program, the city will not renew salvage permits 
held by three companies when they expire next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned from some of the other (recycling) programs around that their two 
main disadvantages were they were not well-publicized, and scavenging 
(prohibition) was not as well enforced as it should have been," Ludwig said.

WEEKENDER: ORCHID LOVERS AND THEIR FLOWERS WILL BLOOM AT BOTANIC GARDEN SHOW 
AND SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris What: Orchid Show. When: Saturday, noon to 4:30 p.m.; Sunday, 
10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Where: South Coast Botanic Garden, 26300 Crenshaw Blvd., 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. Admission: $3, adults; $1.50, seniors and students; 75 
cents, 
</P>

<P>
Orchids are lovely, even exotic, flowers, favored above most other blossoms for 
luxurious corsages. 
</P>
<P>
But cultivating and collecting them can be downright pathological, according to 
some orchid fanciers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disease, orchiditis. It's symptoms are a lack of control when it comes 
to orchids," says Michol Colgan, president of the 120-member South Bay Orchid 
Society. Those afflicted fill their yards and homes with hundreds of orchids; 
they devote hours a week to watering and repotting their plants; some spend 
thousands of dollars to build back-yard greenhouses that are soon bursting with 
the lavender, brown or yellow flowers that can resemble stars or butterflies 
and produce a congruence of petals that look like slippers or little dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Jacobsen says she's devoted to the nearly 700 cymbidium orchids 
growing in her yard. But, she says, some of her friends don't call it devotion. 
"They say I'm demented." 
</P>
<P>
Why this allegiance to a not-too-pretty plant that sometimes doesn't even have 
the courtesy to bloom? It's a combination of variety -- there are more than 
30,000 species -- and the aura of luxury that orchids acquired centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday and Sunday, orchid society members will try to demonstrate the 
allure of their favorite plant at their ninth annual show and sale at the South 
Coast Botanic Garden on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 orchids will be on view. Show Chairman Jim Weiss said anyone who 
has owned an orchid plant for at least 60 days may bring it in for judging, 
which will take place Saturday morning. Ribbons will be awarded based on plant 
structure and the number, shape and color of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Videos shown every two hours will present the history and care of orchids, and 
society members will be there to field questions. The first 500 women will 
receive complimentary floral sprays. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors say orchids are popular simply because nature has produced so many 
varieties. Although their primary habitat is the tropics, Colgan said they 
"grow up to altitudes of 5,000 feet, in cool climates, in the desert and the 
jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Some are hearty enough to grow outdoors, rain or shine, while others need the 
pampering of a greenhouse. Many can be bought for a few dollars, while some 
one-of-a-kind hybrids can fetch a price of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Weiss said all orchids make some demands on their owners: "They can't just 
be stuck in the ground. The majority grow in pots and they have to be cared 
for. It's simply watering, but not over-watering, proper fertilization and 
providing the proper light." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, they may never bloom -- something that adds to the excitement of 
seeing a plant flower for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Orchids became associated with wealth during the days of European exploration, 
when explorers brought them to England from the tropics. The privileged built 
greenhouses for the plants, said Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Day Jr., a retired commercial orchid grower, said orchids became serious 
business in England. One plant drew 5,000 pounds at auction in an era when a 
pound was worth $5. "People would try to find out where they were obtained, but 
the explorers would conceal the locales," he said. "Some species were lost for 
100 years before they were rediscovered." 
</P>
<P>
Even though no one has to be rich to own orchids these days, the mystique 
lingers. "There's the exotic bit," said Robert Streeter, who has been raising 
orchids for 35 years. "You're growing something that has a reputation of being 
the ultimate, plus being a beautiful, beautiful flower." 
</P>
<P>
Botanic garden foundation Executive Director Norma Cantafio said the orchid 
show draws one of the garden's biggest crowds every year -- perhaps that's 
because coastal Southern California is ideal orchid country. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy cymbidiums, with their tall spikes that may carry up to 25 blooms, are 
the local favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Streeter said that even some plants that would demand a greenhouse elsewhere 
thrive outdoors here because it's close to the beach and there is no frost. 
"I've moved plants out of my greenhouse and they've done better outdoors," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's show left little doubt about the South Bay's devotion to orchids. 
Weiss said a Santa Ana condition sent temperatures to 105 degrees, but 1,700 
people showed up anyway. "We hope it's cooler this year and that we have even 
more people." Gerald Faris What: Orchid Show. When: Saturday, noon to 4:30 
p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Where: South Coast Botanic Garden, 26300 
Crenshaw Blvd., Palos Verdes Peninsula. Admission: $3, adults; $1.50, seniors 
and students; 75 cents, youngsters ages 5 to 12. Information: 544-1948.

MERCHANTS, HOMEOWNERS CLASH OVER LID ON BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Boulevard property owners Thursday condemned a plan aimed at 
controlling development over the next 20 years on the San Fernando Valley's 
"main street," saying the restrictions would ruin their land values. 
</P>
<P>
Residents responded that the plan was needed in order to protect them from 
overdevelopment, noise and gridlock traffic that is spilling into residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicting points of view were aired at a hearing on the proposed Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan, held at Portola Junior High School in Tarzana before 
Gordon Hamilton, an examiner for the Los Angeles Planning Department. Hamilton 
will incorporate the comments into a report to be presented to the Planning 
Commission on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The disputes echoed long-running arguments among developers, community leaders 
and homeowner groups, who have been battling over the impact of development on 
the boulevard since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been blasted by property owners as too restrictive and by 
homeowners as not restrictive enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just going to hurt us; this would destroy us," said businessman 
Pete Austin, who owns an actuarial service and is head of a group of 100 
commercial property owners that he said does not include major developers. He 
said the plan "is destroying our rights. It's just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overly Dense' 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Jerry Zimmer of Sherman Oaks countered: "These unsightly office and 
shopping centers we have already are no good. These overly dense centers are 
undesirable, especially when they're almost in the back yards of residents." 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan was partially designed to curb development of major projects 
on the boulevard, Austin said it would affect mainly property owners who have 
small- to medium-sized parcels that they may want to build on. 
</P>
<P>
"About 80% of the property owners have a small amount of frontage," he said. 
"With all the restrictions, we won't be able to build anything. It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
But other homeowners said the plan did not go far enough. "Ventura Boulevard is 
a nightmare, a disaster," said Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of 
Encino. "We want no more theaters, no more nightclubs or commercial 
development. We're not going to take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Details of the plan may be revised in other hearings before it reaches the Los 
Angeles City Council for final approval, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was shaped by city planners, consultants and a citizens 
advisory committee, calls for building restrictions and traffic improvements in 
Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
About 19 million square feet of development is affected, mostly in Encino and 
Sherman Oaks. Motorists now make about 70,000 trips a day on the busy 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no controls on development, about 40 million square feet of 
commercial development could be built, generating 150,000 more vehicular trips, 
"which would result in round-the-clock traffic jams," said Dick Platkin, 
project manager of the plan for the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
But with upgraded traffic signals, street widening and other improvements, to 
be paid for by proposed development fees, the boulevard could accommodate an 
additional 8.6 million square feet of commercial development and more than 
29,000 added auto trips a day by the year 2010, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most disputed portion of the plan deals with the "trip tax," to be imposed 
on developers based on the number of vehicle trips that their projects generate 
during peak rush-hour periods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied to Traffic 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the plan include limiting the size of projects according to 
the amount of traffic they generate. The proposal also calls for measures to 
transform parts of the car-clogged thoroughfare into "pedestrian villages" with 
sidewalk cafes and benches to encourage commuters to walk instead of drive. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal covers all of the property fronting Ventura and Cahuenga Boulevard 
from east of Barham Boulevard in Studio City to Leonora Drive in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would also require the second story of structures at least two stories 
high to be set back from the edge of the building so that the front would not 
form a vertical wall. Mirrored glass on buildings would be prohibited except as 
trim. All new projects, except for single-family residences, would need to 
undergo land-use and design review by the Planning Department before a building 
permit could be issued. 
</P>
<P>
Also, owners of buildings with surface parking lots could be required to place 
trees every four parking spaces. The five communities would have distinctive 
sidewalks to distinguish them from each other. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the fee per daily average trip to a development would be $4,687 
for Studio City, $3,910 for Sherman Oaks and Encino, $2,156 for Tarzana and 
$2,194 for Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The fees, which would be payable when a property owner applied for a building 
permit, would raise more than $90 million, Platkin said. About 90% of such 
funds would pay for scenic improvements, including landscaping, and for parking 
and widening intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 10% would help pay for consultants and other expenditures 
associated with drafting the plan, he said. Studies leading up to the 
preliminary draft of the proposal have cost about $500,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varying Car Trips 
</P>
<P>
The number of trips to be generated by a project would vary by area, according 
to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
In Studio City, 2.75 trips would result for every 1,000 square feet of 
property. For each 1,000 square feet of property in other areas, 2.98 trips 
would be generated in Sherman Oaks, 2.91 trips in Encino, 2.39 trips in Tarzana 
and 2.35 trips in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner representatives complain that the developer fees are too low. They 
say there should be an across-the-board tax of at least $5,000 per trip. 
Developers say the proposed fees are already too high. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the plan would be updated every five years, Platkin said. A plan 
review board made up of city planners and Los Angeles City Council appointees 
would be established and would meet twice monthly to study results of the 
controls.

SON ACCUSED OF KILLING ACTRESS TELLS COURT SHE ATTACKED HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taking the witness stand in his own defense for the first time Thursday, 
Timothy Scott Roman tearfully testified that his mother, actress Susan Cabot, 
attacked him with a barbell and a scalpel the night she was found bludgeoned to 
death in her Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, dressed in a neat gray pinstripe suit, spoke softly as he described 
finding his mother dead in her room. But, he said, he does not remember killing 
her, as prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, a 25-year-old former art student, is charged with bludgeoning Cabot, a 
1950s-era B-movie actress, to death with a barbell on Dec. 10, 1986. Roman 
pleaded not guilty, and Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp is 
conducting his non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Roman portrayed his mother, who was 59 at the time of her death, as suffering 
from increasing physical and mental deterioration, which led him to call her 
doctor the day before her death. Cabot had severe asthma and seemed to be 
having a nervous breakdown, Roman said softly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Precipitated Attack 
</P>
<P>
Roman said his mother's doctor instructed him to call paramedics if her 
condition worsened. His attempt to call them the next night precipitated 
Cabot's attack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was wrong with her. I'd never seen her this bad before," 
Roman said under questioning from Richard P. Lasting, one of his two lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"She was screaming. She was calling for her mother. She was talking to herself. 
I thought I'd better get help for her." 
</P>
<P>
But when Roman picked up the phone beside Cabot's bed, she started screaming at 
him to put the phone down and leave her alone, Roman testified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Know What to Do' 
</P>
<P>
"Then she started saying, 'Who are you?' " Roman testified. "I just stood 
there. I didn't know what to do. She got off the bed and picked up a weight 
bar. She picked it up and started swinging it at me. She might have grazed me. 
I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Roman, born a dwarf and treated with growth hormones, is 5 feet, 4 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
Roman then burst into tears and was unable to continue. After a short court 
recess, he said Cabot attacked him with the scalpel, which he said she kept to 
cut plants and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to push her away from me, just to get out of that room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not remember what happened next until he realized that his 
mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Roman admitted that he lied to police, telling them that a burglar in a Ninja 
mask had killed his mother, and that he hid the barbell and scalpel because he 
was scared and "didn't think anyone would understand the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, Michael Carter, a tutor hired by Cabot to help Roman with 
his schoolwork, testified that Cabot was prone to histrionics and frequently 
shrieked at Roman during the about 100 tutoring sessions he conducted at the 
Cabot home. Carter said Roman was protective of his mother and never grew angry 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabot home was dirty and unkempt, littered with food and newspapers that 
were three to four years old, Carter said, adding: "It was difficult to find a 
place to work with Tim because there was so much stuff around." 
</P>
<P>
Roman, who has been free since June on $25,000 bail, faces a maximum sentence 
of life in prison because prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
His first trial ended in a mistrial after his lawyer complained of 
stress-induced heart problems.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER BOY SHOOTS HIMSELF ACCIDENTALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 4-year-old Lancaster boy accidentally shot himself in the shoulder Thursday 
with a loaded derringer that he found in a neighbor's pickup truck, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gualano IV was admitted to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center with 
a minor gunshot wound, Sgt. Jerry Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in a residential garage in the 1300 block of West Avenue 
J-3 about 3:30 p.m., Wolf said. Gualano had walked to the garage from his 
parents' house in the same block and climbed into the truck, where he found a 
.38-caliber derringer on the floorboard, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the pickup, George Blackwell, told investigators that he heard a 
shot, then saw the wounded boy walking outside the back door of his apartment, 
Wolf said. Blackwell and the boy's father, Albert Gualano III, who was standing 
outside his house when the shooting occurred, rushed the boy to the hospital, 
Wolf said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRUSH FIRE BURNS 10 ACRES IN SUN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A slow-moving brush fire in Sun Valley blackened 10 acres Thursday night but 
caused no injuries or structural damage, the Los Angeles Fire Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started about 7 p.m. near the 7800 block of North Hollywood Way and 
was contained by 8:30 p.m., said Greg Acevedo, Fire Department spokesman. More 
than 50 firefighters from the city and county fire departments were assisted by 
four water-dropping helicopters, he said. Two engines from the Lockheed Co. 
Fire Department, stationed at nearby Burbank Airport, helped battle the flames, 
Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said smoke illuminated by spotlights from helicopters mixed with 
orange flames to provide an eerie backdrop for evening commuters on the nearby 
Golden State Freeway. But the spectacle did not back up traffic on the freeway, 
a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the fire was being investigated, Acevedo said.

LEWIS AND JOHNSON MEET BUT DON'T SPEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN DAVIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World-class sprinters Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis had their first showdown since 
the Seoul Olympics Thursday, with Lewis upstaging his rival in an unlikely 
setting -- a Capitol Hill news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the Canadian runner stripped of the 100-meter gold medal in last 
year's Olympics after he tested positive for steroids, was in Washington 
supporting the introduction of legislation to impose new restrictions on 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, the American sprinter who was awarded the gold medal upon Johnson's 
disqualification, said he was in town doing research for a soon-to-be-completed 
autobiography and dropped in on the gathering to lend his support. 
</P>
<P>
But the American stole the show when California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) 
was summoned to a vote on the House floor and had Johnson whisked from the room 
until he could return. The crowd then turned to Lewis, who sat through the 
event virtually unnoticed until Johnson's departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why Ben Johnson is here," said Lewis, a noted champion of 
stricter regulations on steroids, in response to a question. "But if he wants 
to speak out against drugs, that's fine. . . . There's no question my support 
is behind this 100%." 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson and Levine returned five minutes later, they reclaimed the 
audience's attention. Johnson, 27, said that he started taking the drugs when 
he was 19 because he believed he would need them to compete at a world-class 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm here to point out that it's wrong to take (steroids)," said the 
Jamaican-born athlete. "Anybody who gets caught taking it is going to be 
punished. I paid my price and I'm here to come forward and to say that I won't 
make the same mistake again." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later about the stricter punishments proposed by the measure, Johnson 
said that they would not have deterred him from using steroids, synthetic 
hormones that promote muscle bulk and increased strength and speed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent rumors about a Johnson-Lewis match race and a longstanding media 
feud that has intensified in the year since the Seoul Olympics, the track stars 
never exchanged words -- only momentary glances. 
</P>
<P>
The steroid legislation, introduced by Levine and co-sponsored by Reps. Henry 
A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Benjamin J. Gilman (R-N.Y.), would place a list 
of steroids on Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act along with street 
drugs such as cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Schedule II drugs are subject to the most stringent governmental controls 
imposed on drugs with recognized medical uses. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation provides for a maximum 20-year prison term for illegal 
distribution of steroids, along with a maximum of one year for possession. 
</P>
<P>
"These are stiff sentences," Levine said. "But they are clearly justified by 
the dangers that these drugs pose to the health of the young people in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Wadler, co-author of "Drugs and the Athlete" and the chief physician of 
the U.S. Open tennis championships, said that steroid use can trigger several 
serious side effects, such as heart and liver damage, sterility, violent mood 
shifts and hair loss. 
</P>
<P>
Several groups already have voiced support for the measure, including the U.S. 
Olympic Committee, the National Football League, the National Federation of 
State High School Assns. and the International Federation of Bodybuilders.

WHALE OF A HUSKY;

<P>
USC LOOKS FOR WAYS TO HANDLE 300-POUND DENNIS BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attention Larry Smith: If you're looking for a way to stop Dennis Brown, the 
University of Washington's 300-pound-plus defensive tackle, when your USC 
Trojans face him Saturday at the Coliseum, try throwing a 6-foot, 180-pounder 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
One with quick moves, lots of teeth and a fin. 
</P>
<P>
It worked last spring in Florida, where where Brown, there to be photographed 
for a magazine's All-American team layout, finally met his match on a fishing 
trip. He caught a hammerhead shark, but not without a furious struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was out in a boat with a fellow lineman, Lester Archambeau of Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, we saw a shark," Brown said. "It went down, my line just took 
off and, half an hour later, I had a shark. I tell you, it was tougher than any 
offensive lineman I've had to face." 
</P>
<P>
The shark's 6-foot, 180-pound dimensions resemble those of many a quarterback 
pursued by Brown, but this was definitely not an opponent he'd consider 
sacking. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Brown threw the big fish back in. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that if I was to mount it, it would cost like $1,000," he said. 
"I didn't have that, being a poor, black kid from L.A." 
</P>
<P>
The need to escape that poor environment is the primary reason Brown wound up 
at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year star at Long Beach Jordan High School, Brown had all the honors -- 
prep All-American, all-state, all-city, all-conference, all-league -- that go 
with the territory. As a senior, he collected 15 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
But he also collected some bad friends along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered going to SC real strongly," he said. "I talked to a lot of 
people, but mostly my grandmother. She was telling me, 'If you stay around 
here, you probably won't get as much accomplished as if you went away. Get away 
from some of the things that are going on in L.A.' I wasn't involved in gangs, 
but the crowd I hung around with . . . " 
</P>
<P>
So off Brown went to the Great Northwest, where he was soon being compared with 
the great Husky linemen of the past -- Reggie Rogers, Ron Holmes and Doug 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to be mentioned in the same sentence (with those guys)," Brown said. 
"It makes me feel good to be compared. But there's always a lot of pressure on 
me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when he didn't always produce at the level of his renowned 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
An ankle injury slowed Brown in his freshman season. In his second year, he 
started every game and put together impressive numbers. He led the club in 
sacks with nine, had 10 tackles in one game and finished the year with 19 
tackles for losses, totaling 97 yards, both figures just short of team records 
-- 21 and 98 -- held by Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, there were new problems -- academic, family and, finally, 
physical. A knee injury severely hampered him at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
It was a miserable year overall for the Husky defense. The team was last in the 
Pac-10 in stopping the run. Stopping is probably not the best term to use in 
this case. Opponents averaged 201 yards rushing against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Brown came back unhurt and his team came back strong this season, beating Texas 
A&amp;M and Purdue in its first two games. But then Washington was nipped by 
Arizona, 20-17, and blown out last week by Colorado, 45-28. The Buffaloes 
totally buffaloed the Husky defense, rushing for 420 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've definitely got to bounce back," Brown said. "After all the flak we took 
last year, we were feeling pretty good the first two games (this season), 
because we were doing some good things. But the last two games, we've gone into 
last year's mode." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington defense might not have had much of a day against Colorado, but 
Smith had nothing but rave reviews for Brown's performance in the game film. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Brown) is comparable to the best we've seen," Smith said. "He's 
really got quick feet. He steps around and, a lot of times, nobody even touches 
him. He has the ability to come up out of a stance and avoid the run block or 
the pass block and be across the line of scrimmage just like that. He's 
extremely effective. He's big. He's strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him take one of the Colorado linemen -- Colorado's got a pretty doggone 
good offensive line -- he just took a guy and boom, just like a flea," Smith 
said, flicking a finger like a man disposing of a piece of lint. "I was amazed. 
It was a tackle. It wasn't a guard. He just flicked the guy off with one arm." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean Brown can look forward to a long afternoon of double-teaming 
Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you have to double-team him," Smith said. "But you sure have to 
be aware of where he is on the field." 
</P>
<P>
That shouldn't be too hard, considering Brown stands 6-4 and weighs more than 
300 pounds. He's not saying just how much more but don't be surprised if he 
weighs himself on a truck scale. He says he likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I play my best when I'm about 300 or a little bit over," he said. "Last year, 
I was down around 280 and I got pushed around a lot with all those double 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
One of Brown's close friends wouldn't mind seeing a double team Saturday. USC 
guard Mark Tucker counts Brown as a good buddy, but not when they face each 
other across the line. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen someone as big move as quick," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
When these two face one another, it's a mind game. Brown likes to talk. Tucker 
likes to concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation usually goes as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Brown: "How are things goin'?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker: "I'm not going to talk. I've got to think about things." 
</P>
<P>
Brown: "Don't you know the plays yet? What's the big thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Tucker just shakes his head and hopes Brown doesn't finish his sentence looking 
back over his shoulder as he heads into the Trojan backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real down to earth," Tucker said of Brown. "He's not arrogant at all." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker will not start the game because of an ankle injury, but is expected to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
A big factor in Brown's renewed enthusiasm this year is his improved family 
situation. The death of his grandmother several years ago was a devastating 
blow. His mother has also died, and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
But he has renewed his once-dormant relationship with his father, filling a 
deep void. Jerome Brown, a Los Angeles roofing contractor, decided his 
relationship with Dennis is so important, he packed up and moved to Seattle to 
live with the Washington lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure mounts up," Brown said, "so it's good to go home and sit down and 
talk to him. He puts it in perspective for me." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Brown has big shoulders, but he's carrying a lot on them -- the pressure 
of being the key block in the bid to rebuild a once-mighty defense, the 
pressure of living up to press clippings, the pressure of living up to a 
tradition of great linemen, and the pressure of staying good enough to become a 
first-round draft choice of a National Football League team next spring, as 
many are predicting. 
</P>
<P>
But when it all becomes overwhelming, Brown can just think back to last spring. 
No matter how tough the opponent, he knows it'll never be tougher than the day 
he truly snatched victory from the jaws of, well, Jaws.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / MAL FLORENCE: PARDEE LINE: HURRY-UP OFFENSE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Football fans are often puzzled when they see a team that has struggled for 57 
or 58 minutes zip down the field in the closing minutes with a hurry-up 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
USC, for example, went 91 yards in a late rush to beat Washington State, 18-17, 
with a two-minute offense. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and players like to explain that the two-minute drill only works 
because of special circumstances -- the defense is geared to stop the bomb so 
the sideline pass is available -- but that it certainly couldn't be used for an 
entire game. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Houston would beg to differ. The Cougars are using the 
hurry-up offense as their basic attack and may be hurrying to all sorts of 
offensive records. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it all the time," said Houston Coach Jack Pardee of his run-and-shoot, 
hurry-up offense that spreads the field with four wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Houston leads the nation by a wide margin in total offense, averaging 658.6 
yards a game. The Cougars rank No. 1 in passing offense, with an average of 548 
yards, and quarterback Andre Ware is the national leader in total offense with 
423.3 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee, the former Ram and Redskin linebacker, concedes that Houston's first 
three opponents -- Nevada Las Vegas, Arizona State and Temple -- were not 
comparable to the caliber of teams the Cougars will play the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our competition level changes drastically," said Pardee, whose team will meet 
three Southwest Conference contenders this month -- Baylor, Texas A &amp; M and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Pardee says that he has a better team than last year's, which had a 
9-3 record and lost to Washington State in the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee, 53, has had an eclectic coaching career. He began with the Florida 
Blazers of the World Football League and moved on to the Chicago Bears and 
Washington Redskins of the National Football League, then the Houston Gamblers 
of the ill-fated United States Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he beat cancer, and in each league, except the WFL, Pardee has 
been named coach of the year at one time. He was so honored again last year in 
the Southwest Conference. That may be a record for varied recognition. 
</P>
<P>
While he was with the Gamblers, Pardee brought in Mouse Davis, the innovator of 
the run and shoot, to establish that offense. 
</P>
<P>
Pardee has stayed with it since he became Houston's coach in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams devote 15 minutes of practice time to the hurry-up offense," Pardee 
said. "That's all we work on. We recruit for it and we get fast players. We 
have some legitimate sprinters. If you don't have great team speed, you're 
wasting your time with it." 
</P>
<P>
The offense baffled Arizona State a few weeks ago, when Houston set a Southwest 
Conference record with 744 yards in total offense on its way to a 36-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Many college defenses have to be concerned about stopping a running game with 
an eight-man front," Pardee said. "Then, they face us and they have to worry 
about pass coverage and they don't work on it all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Like, Arizona State. They're a zone team. They didn't have the ability to jump 
into man coverage, or do any blitzing effectively. We gave them a different 
picture than they face with other teams." 
</P>
<P>
Pardee said that Ware, a junior, is a super athlete who thrives on the work 
ethic, comparing him in that regard to his old Ram teammate, Roman Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a great arm and has the quality of quarterbacks I've had such as Joe 
Theismann and Jim Kelly," Pardee said. "He has the temperament of a linebacker. 
He's so tough that he just won't be intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Houston is prospering on the field, it is laboring under National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanctions based on infractions from the previous 
coaching regime. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars lost 10 scholarships and can't appear on television or go to a bowl 
game this season. The sentence is less severe next season, with only a bowl 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
As the nation's 12th-ranked team, Pardee said Houston doesn't have the depth 
of, say, Notre Dame or Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'd match up with them," he said confidently. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't often that an Oregon-Washington State matchup has much significance in 
the Pacific 10 Conference race, or that both teams are nationally ranked. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Northwest schools aren't the doormats they once were in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Washington State will be emotionally very high coming off a very 
difficult defeat in a game they believe they deserved to win," Oregon's Coach 
Rich Brooks said of WSU's loss to USC last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're an outstanding football team," he said. "They can play with anyone in 
the country and defeat anyone in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who play the Ducks Saturday in Eugene, Ore., are ranked 21st 
nationally. Oregon is No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice that some of the also-rans in past years, like us and Washington 
State, now are getting the national attention that we struggled hard to earn," 
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to Lou Holtz to find something negative in an eased-up, 40-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his team's win over Purdue, the Notre Dame coach said his reserves 
didn't impress him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we got to play a lot of people, but I was really disappointed that 
the second team didn't have more continuity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other schools don't have much continuity with their first teams. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue Coach Fred Akers had a more accurate assessment of the top-ranked Irish. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most talented group I've seen put together in a long, long time," 
he said. "Maybe ever." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, which has a 1-3 record, is next for the Fighting Irish. Just imagine 
what Holtz will be saying after that one. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn Coach Pat Dye conceded that Tennessee has the inside track to win the 
Southeastern Conference championship after beating his Tigers last Saturday, 
21-14. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran the ball straight at us, and we couldn't do a lot about it," said Dye 
of Tennessee's 350 yards rushing. "We were manhandled up front. That's the 
worst we've been whipped in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Telander, in his book, "The Hundred Yard Lie," which denounces the 
hypocrisy in college football, asked former UCLA Coach Pepper Rodgers why 
anyone would want to coach? 
</P>
<P>
Said Rodgers: "Power. There's no other job where you can yell, 'Hit it,' and a 
hundred men drop to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Clarifying a rule: When USC kicked off to Washington State late in the second 
quarter of last Saturday's game, the ball was recovered by the Trojans in the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Since a kickoff becomes a free ball after 10 yards, it was presumed by some 
that USC had scored a touchdown. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
The rule: "The ball becomes dead and belongs to the team defending its goal 
when a free kick is untouched by team B (the receiving team) before touching 
the ground on or behind team B's goal line." 
</P>
<P>
If USC had recovered the ball in the field of play, it would have retained 
possession.

SUTCLIFFE NOW USING MORE THAN JUST ARM

The discovery, like most things in Rick Sutcliffe's career, has not come easy. 
There has been pain and wondering and desperation because a part of his body 
suddenly didn't work. There has been conflict with his pride, then conflict 
with his manager. 
</P>
<P>
But ultimately, as he hopes fans will see Saturday in Game 3 of the National 
League Championship Series, there has been acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Sutcliffe, at 33, has realized he is growing old. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say, this year has been a good time for growing up," said the Cub 
pitcher with a grin. "I am not going to say growing old." 
</P>
<P>
When he takes the mound against San Francisco's Mike LaCoss at Candlestick 
Park, he will be just 17 days removed from his shortest start in four years, a 
1 2/3-inning stint against Philadelphia that was halted with a sore shoulder. 
He was rushed from the clubhouse to see Dr. Michael Schafer, who took one look 
at the inflamed shoulder and asked just one question. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to know, what took me so long to get in here?" Sutcliffe recalled. 
"I guess the shoulder looked pretty irritated. I guess it had just been 
overworked." 
</P>
<P>
Through the miracles of pills and pregame stretching, Sutcliffe did not miss a 
start, finishing with two decent outings, including six good innings for a 5-1 
win in the Cubs' season finale in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But the pitcher you see Saturday will be far different from the pitcher who was 
the National League rookie of the year for the Dodgers in 1979 and then won the 
NL Cy Young Award five years later. 
</P>
<P>
This pitcher may worry about his shoulder. He may worry about his fastball. He 
may not last more than six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've finally realized that I can't do things like I used to do," said 
Sutcliffe, who matches his 16-11 record and 3.66 earned-run average against 
LaCoss' 10-10 record and 3.17 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"But," Sutcliffe protested, "it's made me a better pitcher. I've learned to 
take something off the ball here and there. I've been forced to think more. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned something (former Dodger pitching coach) Red Adams always tried 
to tell me -- great pitchers use their eyes and their ears." 
</P>
<P>
And don't overwork their aging arms, something Sutcliffe learned this year 
against the Dodgers beginning the Friday before the All-Star break. He started 
and beat the Dodgers, 6-4, that afternoon and then pitched in relief two days 
later in the Cubs' 11-4 win over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I went home and played golf for a day, thinking I would have four days 
off for the All-Star break," Sutcliffe said. "But then the National League 
called me." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in Anaheim a day later as an All-Star emegency replacement for 
Houston's Mike Scott. Next thing he knows, he's throwing a relief inning. 
</P>
<P>
"That was three appearances in five days -- way too much," said Sutcliffe, who 
said he was hurting for much of the rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
He would pitch, then complain about the pain, then pitch again. It was a method 
that was a constant source of irritation for Cub Manager Don Zimmer, who would 
privately wonder why Sutcliffe didn't seek medical attention if he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between pain and strain, and I thought I always knew 
that difference," Sutcliffe said. "I know better now. Like I said, I'm . . . 
growing up." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who have racked him with two defeats and a 4.03 ERA in his three 
starts against them this year, only hope that older and wiser does not mean 
sharper. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Roger Craig received many congatulatory telegrams following the Giants' 
Game 1 victory, including a confusing one from the rock group The Grateful 
Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell I didn't know anything about them," he said. "I thought they were a 
funeral home." 
</P>
<P>
Remember the former Cub ballgirl who was fired for appearing in Playboy? Marla 
Collins is now 31, married to a real estate developer and living with him and 
their infant daughter in a Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
She still wonders why the Cubs were upset after she appeared in the buff in the 
September 1986 issue. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't put anyone with lots of curves in real short shorts and a tight 
shirt if you don't want her to be noticed," Collins told the Chicago Tribune. 
"After the magazine came out, they said I was supposed to be this sweet, 
innocent little thing, sitting with her hands folded in her lap. Come on!" 
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of weeks, you could be reading plenty about everyone who has 
helped precocious Giant third baseman Matt Williams survive three years worth 
of bounces between triple-A Phoenix and the big leagues. You will read about 
the advice he recieved from Giant batting instructors and fielding gurus and 
Williams' many roommates. 
</P>
<P>
But before you believe any of it, Williams would like to clarify one thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who has gone through the bad times -- nobody else, just me," he 
said. "It bothers me that everybody else gets the credit when I do well. 
</P>
<P>
"It was me getting sent to Phoenix, it was me struggling at the plate, it was 
all me. Just like now, it is me driving in the runs, and me making the plays." 
</P>
<P>
Williams says that he is comforted by one daily thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm the one who's done this," he said. "Nobody else."

LUCKY OR NOT, STORM DAVIS STILL CAME UP WITH 19 VICTORIES IN 1989 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He began his career uneasily in Baltimore in the early 1980s, billed as the 
next Jim Palmer, but today Storm Davis may be baseball's foremost example of 
what it means to be in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Davis started 31 games and completed only one. 
</P>
<P>
He worked a meager total of 169 1/3 innings, averaging fewer than six innings a 
start. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up 21 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 4.36 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
But he finished 19-7. 
</P>
<P>
You want luck? You want stupefyingly good fortune? 
</P>
<P>
It will be embodied on the Skydome's pitching mound tonight when Davis starts 
for the Oakland Athletics against Toronto's Jimmy Key in Game 3 of the American 
League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Things have broken so well for Davis this season that he doesn't even mind 
being called "the luckiest man in America," as one Bay Area columnist described 
him this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real lucky," Davis admits. "Whatever anyone wants to say. I won 19 
games. I took my turn 31 times and won 19 games." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Davis' run was better than that. Oakland went on to win all five of 
Davis' no-decisions, making the A's 24-7 on days Davis pitched in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Davis' success can be traced, no doubt, to the brute force of the 
Oakland offensive assault. But Davis is also the leading beneficiary of the A's 
legions-deep bullpen, which often begins bailing for him in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be the tidiest approach to winning baseball, but it's hard to knock 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
"This here may have changed major league baseball," Davis says. "I think now 
you are going to see more of this -- where relievers are more involved. It's an 
adjustment. I don't know if we'll ever go back to the old way." 
</P>
<P>
Finally escaping Palmer's shadow also has given Davis peace of mind. After 
winning 13 and 14 games in 1983 and 1984, his first two full seasons in 
Baltimore, Davis slumped to 9-12 by 1986, earning him exile to San Diego, where 
he went 2-7 with a 6.18 ERA in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since his trade to Oakland on Aug. 30, 1987, though, Davis has a 36-15 record 
and A's pitching coach Dave Duncan credits much of the turnaround to Davis' 
getting away from the Palmer comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good," Davis agreed. "Jim wears his hair too short. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got over here, I just quit worrying about what Jim Palmer did. I like 
Jim a lot and respect all that he did, but I like it over here." 
</P>
<P>
At 19-7, he would say that. 
</P>
<P>
Fallout from Rickey Henderson's tiny steps and Dave Parker's leisurely steps in 
Game 2 continued during Thursday's workout session at the Skydome. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto third baseman Kelly Gruber was still miffed about Parker's painfully 
long home run trot, which he and other Blue Jay teammates considered a 
tasteless breach of baseball etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't particularly care for the hotdog type," Gruber said. "It sort of makes 
me want to get some vengeance. It's sort of like rubbing salt into the wound. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that you play hard and try to win with grace. I'm glad I'm not a 
pitcher because you would see a lot of heads ducking. There might be some 
messages I'd send up there. 
</P>
<P>
"The staring and the long walks around the bases may be their style of game. I 
just don't like it. Showboating doesn't mean anything to me." 
</P>
<P>
Counterpoint, again, was provided by Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa. 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble reading about the game in all the articles (about Game 2)," 
LaRussa said. "Everyone is writing about all the stuff that's flying around. 
They're upset with Rickey doing this or Parker running around the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"What I know about the Toronto Blue Jays is that they have some very 
competitive ballplayers. So when you get beat two games, nobody's in a good 
mood and things are said. I understand that. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that nobody lose their perspective on this. Rickey's had two big 
ballgames for us, and our club has had two good, aggressive games." 
</P>
<P>
And from Oakland relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley: "Rickey Henderson is a player 
who likes his style of play. He's emotional, especially in a series like this. 
He may seem like he gets a little too high at times, but that's his style of 
play. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
One way to stop the A's showboating, real or imagined, was suggested by LaRussa 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"In Rickey's case, if you can keep him off base, that's the answer," LaRussa 
said. "The No. 1 thing after that is to have a guy on the mound who is 
difficult to run against. Like Jimmy Key." 
</P>
<P>
Key gets the call tonight and will try to succeed where Dave Stieb and Todd 
Stottlemyre failed, allowing Henderson to already set a playoff record with six 
stolen bases in just two games. 
</P>
<P>
"I pride myself in holding runners," Key said. "It is something I will have to 
watch. My attention will be split with certain guys on base." 
</P>
<P>
Key also agrees with LaRussa's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is going to be that I'm going to try and keep the guys at the 
top of the order off base, so we can get the big guys hitting with no one one 
base. I think that's the key to beating them." 
</P>
<P>
In the first two games, Henderson has reached base seven times -- two singles, 
four walks, hit by a pitch -- in nine plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Home dome advantage: Here are a few reasons the Blue Jays couldn't wait to get 
back to Toronto: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 55 games played at the Skydome, they are 34-21. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In their last 26 games at the Skydome, they are 20-6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the retractable Skydome roof is closed, they are 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto has also sold out each of its last 35 home games. Tonight, the streak 
will reach 36.

The Athletics Congress' national board of review, which was to have conducted a 
hearing into allegations that Southland track and field coach Chuck DeBus 
supplied performance-enhancing drugs to his athletes, announced that it will 
review on Oct. 13 an agreement reached last month between TAC and DeBus that 
apparently rendered the hearing unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached without the support of the three-person panel, allowed 
DeBus to resign from the sport for two years, without admitting guilt. However, 
TAC may not have had the authority to make such an agreement without the 
panel's approval.

Tests disclosed that Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets does not have a tumor 
in his pitching arm. 
</P>
<P>
Met spokesman Rick Lawes said Gooden still has a small tear in a muscle in the 
back of his right shoulder and is undergoing a therapy program at his Florida 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News reported that Gooden became concerned when an 
unidentified man, who claimed to be a doctor affiliated with the Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, called the players' association last 
month and said the shoulder injury that sidelined Gooden for much of the second 
half of the season might have been the result of a tumor.

NEWSWIRE: ROBINSON, JOHNSON WILL MANAGE IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Frank Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles said he will return to the 
team, as expected, but in something of a surprise, Dave Johnson kept his job, 
after all, when the New York Mets announced that he will be back for a seventh 
season as manager. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 46, signed a three-year contract after last season. He has led the 
Mets to two division titles and four second-place finishes in six years, with a 
575-395 record. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 54, a candidate for American League manager of the year, has a 
three-year contract that renews itself after every season and guarantees him a 
position in the Orioles' front office when he is through managing. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson led the Orioles to an 87-75 season one year after the team finished 
54-107.

CHRONICLING KIDS' FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Last December, Jill Krementz, the well-known photographer, sat quietly in the 
back seat of a taxicab. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing unusual in that, except that the entire East Side was crazed and cranky 
over "Gorbylock." All around her, cabbies and truckers, pedestrians and 
passengers fumed and growled over the immovable traffic stalled by the 
departure of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Krementz just sat there and hummed to herself. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the exasperated cabbie turned around and grumbled: "Lady, I can't 
believe how calm you are. How do you do it?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Healthy' 
</P>
<P>
She answered simply: "I'm healthy, and I'm going home to a healthy husband and 
child." 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of thinking that comes from spending two years chronicling the 
lives of 14 children with serious illnesses and disabilities. Krementz's latest 
book is "How It Feels to Fight for Your Life" (Little, Brown, $15.95). It's her 
26th book and the fourth in her "How It Feels" series; other volumes have dealt 
with divorce, adoption and a parent's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to do subjects that others stay away from," she said recently over 
cappuccino at a Third Avenue bistro. "They don't scare me. They certainly have 
a toll and they make me very sad, but I do them for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
She does them for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"I want this book to be inspiring to other children," says Krementz, who lives 
with her daughter, Lily, and husband, author Kurt Vonnegut, in a four-story 
East Side brownstone. "I chose the title because that's what these kids are 
talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Each profile includes Krementz's photographs and text in which the child tells 
his or her life story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Just Transcription 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that I just turn on the tape and transcribe it," said 
Krementz. "Sometimes the children think that." 
</P>
<P>
Not so. 
</P>
<P>
Krementz interviews parents, nurses, doctors, friends, and then reaches into 
the children's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to put a stethoscope on their hearts so that I can listen to their 
innermost feelings," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's a world of anger and anxiety, fear and hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Having open-heart surgery has definitely changed my thinking," says Joey Buck, 
14. "One thing I can say for sure is that now I know how to fight for my life 
and never give up hope. And I know I can live through an incredible amount of 
pain. When you've been as sick as I have, it makes you grow up faster." 
</P>
<P>
Helping Krementz celebrate the book's publication will be Joey; Alisha 
Weissman, 16, who is fighting epilepsy; and Rachel DeMaster, 10, who is 
fighting diabetes. Also coming will be William and Helen Kleinegger, whose son, 
Michael, was diagnosed with cancer of the blood when he was 15. He underwent 
chemotherapy and lost 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're really sick, no matter what your sickness is, you have to accept 
what happened and face up to it, no matter what," Michael says in the book. 
"You have to fight, fight, fight! You're not going to help yourself if you run 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Michael died on May 23 when he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the saddest days in my life," Krementz says. 
</P>
<P>
But she also sees the positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his attitude, Michael lived a much better life than otherwise," she 
says quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived with hope."

Question: I'm tempted to buy one of the new shearlings, especially the Donna 
Karan jacket with the drawstring at hips and hem. Please tell me more about 
shearling. How does it differ from sheepskin? -- L.A.N. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Here's a sketch of Karan shearling, and some care information from 
leather expert Clifford Olson of Positano Leathers. Shearling is taken from the 
first shearing of a yearling, and the skins are tanned with the wool on. Treat 
the suede side of shearling like any suede, advises Olson, suggesting that a 
good brushing with a plastic-bristle brush will revive tired and/or worn skins. 
If you get a spot, he says to use a suede eraser such as Tana's Nubuck Block. 
The fur side of your shearling won't show the dirt as much as the suede side, 
and when it does, dry cleaning is not as dangerous as with suede or leathers. 
"Dry cleaners much prefer cleaning shearling," says Olson, "because it causes 
fewer problems than either leather or suede. Karan's shearling is available by 
special order at Saks Fifth Ave.

GETTING OUR GOATEES -- AS THE BEAT GOES CHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIO SCARDAPANE, Dario Scardapane writes on movies and fashion for several 
Los Angeles publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tufts of fashion whimsy are sprouting on the faces of Los Angeles' 
men-about-town. Goatees, those small, carefully crafted beards popularized by 
such disparate characters as Mephistopheles and Maynard Krebs in the 1960s TV 
show "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," are making a comeback. Mixing beatnik 
and biker chic, they've become a definite fashion look. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, a goatee resembles a goat's beard in its pointed shape that 
covers only the chin area. But this basic form has been widely interpreted over 
time. Hairdresser Steve Renteria, who works at the Hair Loft, says the most 
popular variation is the Van Dyke, where mustache and beard connect. And, he 
notes, maintaining a goatee requires a close, daily shave as well as a weekly 
trim. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer John Ragel, assistant to celebrity portraitist Annie Leibovitz, 
says his goatee has a certain gritty appeal, but "women hate it." 
</P>
<P>
A quick survey confirms his claim that women dislike goatees. But local gossip 
columnist Janet Charlton disagrees. "There's something infinitely wicked about 
goatees," she says. "A well-clipped goatee is so refined. It shows that a man 
takes care in how he looks." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sylvester, a self-described jack-of-all-trades whose beard was inspired by 
Vincent Price, says his girlfriend is a major supporter of his look but adds, 
"It's weird, she hates beards but loves goatees." The object of his hairy 
affection, magazine editorial assistant Suzi Joi Kiefer, explains: "It makes 
him look so sinister."

'PEANUTS' CREATOR COMES OUT OF HIS SHELL

<P>
Good grief! Charlie Brown is 40 years old? 
</P>
<P>
Yep. Charlie and the rest of the "Peanuts" gang hit the Big Four-O, a midlife 
plateau that usually sets off a good deal of soul searching in most folks. Just 
don't expect to see it mentioned in the award-winning strip. 
</P>
<P>
"A comic strip should not make self-conscious statements," says Charles Schulz, 
67, creator of the "Peanuts" characters who appear in more than 2,000 
newspapers in 68 nations. "There will be nothing in the strip." 
</P>
<P>
But that hardly means the milestone will pass unnoticed. An exhibition is 
planned at the Louvre in Paris, and half time at the Super Bowl next January 
will feature a birthday extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the story of Charlie, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and friends can 
finally be told. The whole truth comes out in the shy cartoonist's biography, 
"Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz," due Thursday from Pharos Books. 
</P>
<P>
The book by Rheta Grimsley Johnson is a first, says Phyllis Henrici of Pharos, 
a sister company of the Scripps Howard newspaper chain. Schulz draws for United 
Features Syndicate, a Scripps Howard subsidiary. "Publishers have wanted to do 
a biography of him for years, but he hasn't wanted to authorize one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What made the difference this time? "I liked her right away," Schulz said of 
Johnson, a columnist for the Memphis Commercial Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lured by Art Ad 
</P>
<P>
Schulz studied art when he was in high school, after he saw a "Do you like to 
draw?" advertisement. "The truth is, I wasn't a very good student," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His first professional job was doing lettering for drawings in Timeless Topix, 
a Catholic comic book. He later taught at the Art Instruction School and sold 
cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. 
</P>
<P>
His cartoon feature, "Li'l Folks," the start of Peanuts, was developed for St. 
Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. The strip was sold to a syndicate in 1950, and the 
name changed to "Peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
Although the book contains stories about all the strip's characters, the most 
interesting is about a character never shown -- the "little red-haired girl" 
who is Charlie Brown's unrequited love. 
</P>
<P>
"Peanuts" began syndication on Oct. 2, 1950, 19 days after Schulz's proposal of 
marriage was turned down in his native St. Paul, Minn., by Donna Mae Wold, the 
original red-haired girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heartbreaking," said Schulz, who proposed five years after plowing across 
France in a half-track as an infantryman during World War II. "It's something 
you never get over, but I think the only purpose in recounting the story was to 
show how experience prompts a cartoonist's ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, whose book discloses that the artist suffers from depression, says 
Schulz's life contains many rejections he translated to the strip. "Rejection 
is his specialty, losing his hobby. He has spent a lifetime perfecting 
failure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fighting Agoraphobia 
</P>
<P>
At first, Johnson thought the artist was kidding about Wold's turning him down. 
"He talked about it as if it took place last year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with depression, the artist also has bouts of agoraphobia, the fear of 
being alone in public places from which escape might be difficult. "The sight 
of a hotel lobby, for example, puts Schulz in a sweat," writes Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears and troubles are too bad, says the author. Yet, there would not be 
Schulz's "unique gift to the world without the sensitivity that so limits his 
personal life."

Natural Gas Pacts Announced: Developers of two competing natural gas pipeline 
projects into California both announced new contracts for gas transportation. 
Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which is proposing a 902-mile pipeline from 
Wyoming to Kern County, said it signed an agreement with Shell Western E &amp; 
P Inc. to transport 100 million cubic feet of gas per day for at least 15 
years. Earlier in the week, the competing Wy-Cal Pipeline Co., which is 
proposing its own 1,000-mile Wyoming-to-California pipeline, said it had signed 
an agreement with Southwest Gas Corp. of Las Vegas to transport 200 million 
cubic feet of gas per day for 15 years.

STRONG APPAREL SALES PACE RETAILERS' SEPTEMBER GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the nation's biggest retailers reported Thursday that they had strong 
sales gains in September as the arrival of fall weather put consumers in the 
mood to buy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
But other store owners said they continued to struggle last month as Americans 
shied away from making more expensive purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pretty good . . . better than we would have expected," said Jeffrey 
Edelman, a retail industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., of the 
stores' overall results. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said, "Apparel 
sales were good; durables were soft." 
</P>
<P>
Cooler weather in many regions sent shoppers into the stores in search of fall 
clothing in the last week to 10 days of September, giving apparel retailers a 
generally strong performance, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical Time 
</P>
<P>
But sales of more expensive durable goods, which include items such as home 
appliances, continued to slump.

SEC Censures Prudential-Bache: The Securities and Exchange Commission censured 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. for what it said were violations of securities 
laws in several transactions. The SEC said Prudential-Bache failed to maintain 
possession or control of $218 million worth of securities that were pledged as 
collateral in so-called custody repurchase agreements between the firm and 
large institutional clients. The total involved 90 security positions and the 
alleged violations occurred during five days in late February and early March, 
1988. Prudential-Bache settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt.

Three Charged in Penny Stock Fraud: Three men were accused of bilking investors 
of more than $10 million, U.S. Atty. Samuel A. Alito Jr. charged in a case he 
said was the first to name a penny stock brokerage as a racketeering 
enterprise. The men manipulated the prices of six companies by issuing bogus 
research reports and bribing fund managers to invest in them, and profited by 
secretly trading in the stock, according to an indictment returned in Newark, 
N.J. Indicted were New York-based Monarch Funding Corp.'s president and owner, 
Leo M. Eisenberg, 68, of Woodmere, N.Y.; Newark-based financial consultant 
Richard O. Bertoli, 56, of Rye, N.Y., and Richard S. Cannistraro, who pleaded 
guilty to related charges in 1987. Cannistraro was an analyst at Woody Gundy 
Inc.

SKINNER PLAN WOULD EASE WAY FOR FOREIGN AIRLINES

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner proposed Thursday to open up some 
U.S. cities with little or no international air service to flights by foreign 
airlines without the usual negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If the plan is adopted, Skinner said, "many more U.S. cities will have the 
opportunity to enjoy the economic benefits" of direct international flights. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a forum on international aviation, the secretary said the 
Transportation Department would formally propose the new rules within the next 
few days. A period for public comment, usually about two months, would follow 
before the rules would take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner did not detail what cities or routes might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that such cities as Charlotte, N.C., and Tampa, Fla., could be 
early applicants seeking foreign service. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department has been flooded with letters from governors, members of 
Congress, mayors and business leaders urging a policy that would open up more 
international routes from cities where passengers have to make connecting 
flights to go abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Permission for foreign airlines to fly the routes would be dependent upon 
having an agreement that would allow U.S. carriers "all the rights our airlines 
require" within the country where the foreign carrier is based, Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, international routes generally are awarded through bilateral 
negotiations between the United States and other countries on a basis of 
reciprocity -- an airline from each country flies the route. 
</P>
<P>
Under Skinner's plan, the United States would approve foreign air carrier 
service between a U.S. city and the carrier's home country if no other airline 
served the route, if the United States has no aviation dispute pending with the 
country and if no U.S. airline or other party raises any "overriding public 
interest objection" to the flight, the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to share our free market competitive concept with any country 
willing to listen," Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal would not replace traditional aviation negotiations. But 
he said the negotiations process has not worked in cases where U.S. carriers 
have no immediate plans to serve a route that a foreign carrier is willing to 
fly.

B. Altman's Put Up For Sale: The troubled L. J. Hooker Corp. put B. Altman 
&amp; Co. on the auction block and said it intends to sell the seven-unit 
department store chain as quickly as possible. "Given the cash constraints of 
L. J. Hooker . . . we believe that a quick sale of Altman's is in the best 
interests of all concerned," said Sanford C. Sigoloff. He is the turnaround 
specialist who was named chairman of L. J. Hooker in August at the same time 
the company filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection for certain 
subsidiaries, including Altman's. Hooker is the Atlanta-based U.S. subsidiary 
of Australia's Hooker Corp., which had invested more than $1 billion in U.S. 
shopping malls, real estate and retailing during the past three years before 
high interest rates and a soft Australian real estate market put the company in 
a financial bind.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN'S L.A. OFFICE CHIEF WILL RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheldon I. Ausman, managing partner of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.'s Los Angeles 
office, will leave at the end of the month, capping a 34-year career at the 
accounting and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman, 56, has managed the firm's office since 1977, during which time it has 
grown from about 450 employees to more than 1,500, becoming one of the area's 
largest accounting concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman managed Andersen's entire Southern California operation, which includes 
smaller offices in the South Bay, Orange County, San Diego, Westwood and 
Woodland Hills, as well as offices in Hawaii, Las Vegas and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
No replacement has been named, but an Andersen spokesman said an announcement 
would follow in the next seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman said in an interview that he was taking advantage of Andersen's early 
retirement program to build a new career outside the accounting field. 
"Retiring is not in my vocabulary," he said. "But I don't want to be an 
accountant; I've already done that for 34 years." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was considering financial consulting work, mergers and acquisitions 
or investment banking as an alternative career. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, he said he would remain in Los Angeles, where his wife, Sandra, is 
chief of protocol for the county. In addition, Ausman and his wife have 
involved themselves in a variety of civic activities, including public 
television station KCET-TV, the Huntington Library, the Western Heritage Museum 
and the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made a tremendous contribution to the community, both he and his wife," 
said R. Michael Shaw, director of taxes, West region, for rival firm Coopers 
&amp; Lybrand in Los Angeles. "Plus, the Andersen office has prospered 
significantly while he's been managing partner . . . They've been formidable 
competitors," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Ausman said his departure had nothing to do with the abortive merger talks 
between Chicago-based Andersen and Price Waterhouse, which were dropped last 
week. Andersen has 231 offices in 49 countries. PATRICK LEE

DOLLAR'S RALLY HELPS LIFT DOW TO A NEW HIGH

Wall Street stocks edged up to another record close Thursday as a round of 
increases in European interest rates blunted the rally that has carried the 
market to record highs this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.47 to 2,773.56, hitting a new 
high for the third straight session. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the week the average has climbed 80.74 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues and declines were evenly balanced in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 177.89 million shares, down from 194.59 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The market started out slightly lower on news that European countries had hiked 
their interest rates to slap down the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
But the dollar's rebound despite the rate increases helped the stock market 
regain its form and a bond market rally lent background support in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar initially declined on the news, reflecting the expectation that 
higher rates in Europe would attract money away from U.S. investments but later 
rebounded in foreign exchange dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Gordon, Dreyfus Corp.'s director of research, said the market's 
performance was commendable in light of the interest rate actions overseas. The 
extent of the increase surprised some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"A full-point rise suggests the market should have been shook up," he said. 
"(But) apparently, there is still some latent buying power." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the increases in Europe did not catch Wall Street totally by 
surprise. In addition, analysts said stock traders' spirits were energized by 
an offer from investor Donald J. Trump to acquire AMR Corp. for $120 a share. 
</P>
<P>
AMR shares jumped 16 7/8 to 99 7/8 as the most active Big Board issue. Delta 
Air Lines, one of the few remaining major carriers that has not attracted a 
takeover bid, gained 3 1/2 to 78 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for those stocks helped send the Dow Jones average of 20 
transportation issues up 31.65 to 1,498.75. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Communications, another prime focus of takeover rumors and 
speculation, rose 3 3/4 to 62. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included Philip Morris, up 3 3/4 at 
175; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1/4 at 45; Chevron, up 1 7/8 at 64 
3/4, and Eli Lilly, up 3/8 at 65. 
</P>
<P>
National Education dropped 5/8 to 12. The company said it expects a loss for 
the third quarter and looks for fourth-quarter revenue down significantly from 
last year's period. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft climbed 3 3/4 to 79 1/4 in the over-the-counter market on top of a 6 
1/2-point gain Wednesday, when the company said it expects to report a 34% 
revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, index-linked buying, possibly by investment trust funds, drove prices 
up just before the close in brisk trading, dealers said. The 225-share Nikkei 
average climbed 140.19 to close at 35,522.99. 
</P>
<P>
A round of interest rate hikes in nine Western European countries, sparked by 
West Germany's Bundesbank raising its two key interest rates, took a heavy toll 
on British stocks. The Financial Times 100 blue chips nose-dived 30.5 to close 
at 2,281.6. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices advanced broadly in the credit markets as the dollar pushed higher 
despite increases in foreign interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained a full point, or $10 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield dropped to 8.07% from 8.16% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the session, bond prices held fairly steady as the central banks in 
West Germany and Great Britain raised key lending rates in moves designed to 
curb the dollar's recent rise. 
</P>
<P>
Higher rates abroad would normally put U.S. rates at a competitive 
disadvantage. But the dollar continued to rise, and that contributed to a surge 
in bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
"This indicates a powerful underlying demand for dollars," said Elliott Platt, 
fixed-income research director for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Advances by the dollar make U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and other securities 
denominated in dollars more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar-led rally in the bond market occurred on the eve of the release of 
some important economic statistics in the September employment report. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect non-farm payroll growth of more than double August's total 
of 110,000, but they say a major reason for the increase will be the return of 
70,000 or so striking communications workers to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose 1/4 point, intermediate maturities climbed by between 3/8 point and 9/16 
point and long-term issues rose as much as 1-3/32 point, according to Telerate 
Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a $1,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9%, up from 8.25% late Wednesday, when the rate was unusually low 
because of technical reasons related to the end of a bank reserve reporting 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of precious metals futures slumped in a disappointed reaction to the 
dollar's late surge in value against other major currencies after a rise in 
European interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, energy futures retreated, coffee futures fell 
again, grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $3.60 lower across the 
board with the contract for delivery in October at $363.40 an ounce; silver was 
8.2 cents to 9.3 cents lower with December at $5.243 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
The slide marked the biggest daily move in gold prices since Sept. 25, but the 
market did not fall out of its recent trading range. 
</P>
<P>
The metals closely followed foreign currencies, which rallied in relation to 
the dollar early in the day only to end lower as the dollar advanced. 
</P>
<P>
The early rally was kicked off by West Germany's decision to raise its key 
interest rate a full percentage point, forcing other European countries to 
follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil futures fell sharply and most other energy futures also declined on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange.

SENATE BILL WOULD GIVE CFTC MORE CLOUT TO BATTLE ABUSES

<P>
A Senate bill introduced Thursday would give the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission more power to curb trading abuses and would make brokerage firms 
liable for customers' losses caused by illegal transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which contains stricter proposals than those in a House-approved 
version, was introduced in response to futures trading violations uncovered by 
a recent Federal Bureau of Investigation probe at two Chicago futures 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation aims to increase brokerage firms' accountability by 
making them liable for damages if clients' money is lost through improper 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 was sponsored by Agriculture 
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, (D-Vt.), and Sen Richard Lugar, (R-Ind.) 
</P>
<P>
In July, 45 traders and a clerk at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the 
Chicago Board of Trade, the largest U.S. commodity exchanges, were indicted as 
a result of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow the CFTC to conduct undercover probes and requires 
fingerprinting and FBI background investigations of futures traders before they 
are registered with the CFTC. 
</P>
<P>
"Any floor trader caught cheating will be severely punished and any exchange 
not policing its floor will be forced to clean up its act," Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
The senators said the bill would authorize an increase in the CFTC's funding to 
$66 million in fiscal 1994 from $41 million in 1990. This would allow the 
hiring of additional staff to monitor trading at exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require U.S. exchanges to keep more precise records of 
transactions and it gives them three years to put new bookkeeping practices 
into effect.

$500-MILLION MORE ASKED FOR FARM RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing slipping U.S. competitiveness and increasing health risks, the National 
Academy of Sciences called Thursday for an annual $500-million increase in 
federally funded agricultural research. 
</P>
<P>
Flying in the face of the federal budget deficit, the academy insisted that the 
tenfold increase in competitive grant money to the Agriculture Department must 
not come from juggling other agriculture funding, but must be "new funding." 
</P>
<P>
The academy made its pronouncement Thursday in a report outlining how the $500 
million should be spent. The words "unlikely to be acquired without substantial 
new funding" run through the 155-page document like a mantra. 
</P>
<P>
The United States faces "new and aggressive competition from abroad," 
particularly in the area of agricultural trade, the report said. The proposed 
boost in research spending is needed to "revitalize and reinvigorate one of the 
leading industries, the agricultural, food and environmental system, in its 
broadest sense."

</P>
<P>
The report was published by the National Research Council, an arm of the 
academy, and was prompted by earlier council studies on the regulation of 
pesticides, alternative agriculture and the genetic engineering of food. 
</P>
<P>
"Those three reports point to a radical shift in the direction of U.S. 
agriculture," said Rick Borchelt, a spokesman for the academy. "What the 
council's Board on Agriculture realized is that to make that shift a reality 
there needs to be a much stronger research support base." 
</P>
<P>
To date, that support has been severely lacking. In the past 25 years, 
agriculture has evolved from the mere growing and processing of foods and 
fibers into an industry forced to grapple with grave health and environmental 
concerns. Research money, however, has not followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubts It Will Get Funds 
</P>
<P>
"Funding for agricultural research has gone down between 1965 and 1988," said 
Theodore Hullar, chancellor of the University of California, Davis, and head of 
the Board on Agriculture. "During that time, we've had enormous changes. There 
have been much more stringent demands for environmental quality . . . and there 
is much fiercer competition from foreign countries." 
</P>
<P>
Although the USDA voiced support for the academy's demands, Assistant 
Agriculture Secretary Charles E. Hess was dubious Thursday about whether the 
money would materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government currently spends approximately $1.2 billion annually on 
agricultural research," Hess said in a written statement. "To be perfectly 
candid, I would like to be able to endorse the funding program proposed in the 
initiative. But, as you realize, we operate within the constraints of the 
federal budget." 
</P>
<P>
In the agriculture appropriations bill before Congress, the House voted to fund 
$40 million in grants, while the Senate voted $45 million. The discrepancy will 
be resolved in conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty unlikely we'd get up to $500 million any time soon," said 
Rocky Kuhn, counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on 
agriculture, rural development and related agencies.

VOLUNTEER GROUP TO BUILD LOW-COST HOUSING IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit home-building group whose most famous 
members are former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalyn, will announce 
plans today for a 48-unit "self-help condominium neighborhood" in Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
The two-acre development, designed for lower-income households, would be the 
largest undertaken by Habitat for Humanity in the nondenominational Christian 
volunteer organization's 13 years of building affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Habitat for Humanity builds housing units with volunteer labor and 
donations from private industry and sells the finished product at cost, often 
making the mortgage loan itself. 
</P>
<P>
The project is being proposed in partnership with the Fieldstone Co., a Newport 
Beach-based residential builder, and the Santa Margarita Co., developer of the 
Rancho Santa Margarita planned community. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Habitat for Humanity, based in Americus, Ga., and the Santa 
Margarita Co. would not comment on the project in advance of this morning's 
press conference, and Fieldstone's president, Peter Ochs, was in Atlanta and 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But a statement issued by representatives of the groups said: "The development 
is the most ambitious of its kind in the United States. The construction of 
these homes will provide a solution to one of Orange County's most pressing 
issues: the need for adequate housing for low-income households." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where housing prices are among the highest in the nation, the 
median price of a resale home in August was almost $248,000 and the median 
price of new homes is well over $325,000. The California Assn. of Realtors 
estimates that only 14% of local families can afford to buy the median-priced 
used home in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Margarita, although the newest planned community in the county 
with several thousand acres still left to develop, is designed in large part 
for first-time home buyers. Many of the new condominium units being built there 
sell for prices well below $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes Rancho Santa 
Margarita, said he was first approached about four months ago by officials of 
the three organizations and asked to help shepherd the project through the 
county bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a unique project," Vasquez said. "It provides a tremendous opportunity 
for home ownership for people who cannot otherwise afford to purchase a housing 
unit in Orange County." Vasquez called the partnership of a builder, a land 
developer and a charitable housing organization "innovative and exciting. This 
is a great opportunity," he said, "and I hope it will be the first of several 
projects like this in the county." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed condominiums, if approved by the county, would be located on a 
two-acre tract within a larger project being built by Fieldstone in the 
northeast section of Rancho Santa Margarita. The exact location could not be 
determined Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Planning Director Michael Ruane said that a preliminary tract map 
and site plan for the Habitat community have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Break in Fees Sought 
</P>
<P>
He said Habitat for Humanity officials currently are negotiating with the 
county for reduction of the costly "infrastructure fees" which could easily 
total $10,000 per unit. Those fees are levied by the county to help pay for 
parks, roads, sewers, police and fire protection and other intangible "support" 
items, Ruane said. 
</P>
<P>
Also being negotiated is waiver of the plan processing fees generally charged 
developers. On a 48-unit project those fees could hit $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ruane said that the county Planning Department would assign the project "top 
priority" once final plans are submitted. "We should be able to get things 
processed and to the (county) Planning Commission in 30 to 60 days from the 
time we get the final plans," Ruane said. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 by Millard Fuller, an Alabama native 
who made a fortune in the mail order business and then poured it all into the 
organization when he decided to dedicate his life to helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Capital, Not Charity' 
</P>
<P>
Fuller has said that the group's guiding philosophy is that "the poor need 
capital, not charity." Potential buyers usually are chosen based on need, 
willingness to help build the houses and ability to repay the mortgage loans 
Habitat for Humanity makes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the organization's volunteers built 2,000 homes and the organization 
said its goal for 1989 is 4,000 units. Habitat for Humanity operates in nearly 
300 cities in the United States, Canada and 25 Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Carter -- an accomplished carpenter and woodworker -- first 
became involved with Habitat for Humanity in 1984 and has said that the 
organization is one of the few volunteer efforts to which he gives a large 
amount of his time. 
</P>
<P>
He has served as a member of the group's board of directors and on several 
occasions has helped generate publicity for the organization simply by showing 
up, hammer in hand, to help on a project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggested by Ochs 
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable source said the Rancho Santa Margarita project was suggested 
by Peter Ochs, founder and president of Fieldstone and a former top executive 
of William Lyon Co. 
</P>
<P>
He approached Habitat for Humanity and the Santa Margarita Co. about the 
project more than four months ago as part of the county Building Industry 
Assn.'s homeless project -- which calls for builders to engage in some type of 
housing program in each of the five county supervisorial districts, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ochs and Anthony Moiso, president of the Santa Margarita Co., both have strong 
business and charitable backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ochs, 45, holds an economics degree from Princeton University and an MBA from 
Stanford. He was president of the William Lyon Co. in 1981 when he decided that 
he wanted to run his own company and founded Fieldstone. He is an avid art 
collector, specializing in early California Impressionist works, and is a 
longtime supporter of the South Coast Repertory theater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started With Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Moiso, 49, is a member of the O'Neill family, which owns the 40,000-acre Rancho 
Mission Viejo. He cut his development teeth on the planned community of Mission 
Viejo -- which later was sold to the Philip Morris Cos. and now is an 
independent city. He spent more than 10 years planning development of the 
5,000-acre Rancho Santa Margarita community in which the Habitat project is to 
be located. 
</P>
<P>
Among his charitable and philanthropic activities, Moiso has supported various 
arts programs and youth groups. Several years ago he donated 40 acres of his 
family's land as a site for the $26-million Santa Margarita Catholic High 
School -- the first Catholic high school built in Orange County in 22 years.

TEEN-AGER HOLDS CLASS CAPTIVE AT ANAHEIM SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ and MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old Loara High School student, armed with a shotgun and pistol, 
walked into a drama class, shot one boy in the face and held other students 
hostage for more than a half hour Thursday, Anaheim authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The armed ninth-grader, reportedly beset with family problems, ordered the 
drama teacher out of the room and later allowed the injured student and 
terrified female classmates to leave. The student held the rest of the class at 
gunpoint while talking to police on a classroom phone and then surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have thought he was serious?" said the wounded student, 15-year-old 
Anthony Lopez, interviewed at his hospital bed Thursday evening. "I mean, the 
guy was calm. He didn't look crazy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him whether the gun was for real and then I said if it was real, why 
didn't he just start shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was in satisfactory condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange after being 
shot in the left side of his face. His jaw is shattered, and the bullet is 
lodged in his neck, said Lopez's mother, Pam Lopez. He is the son of an Anaheim 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident began shortly before 9:30 a.m. when the youth, 
identified by students as ninth-grader Cory Robb, entered the school's choir 
room where the drama class was being held and ordered the teacher, Kenneth 
Tuttle, to leave. The teacher tried to take the rest of the class with him, but 
Robb insisted that Tuttle leave alone, students said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, after firing one shot, Robb allowed most of the girls 
in the class and the wounded boy to walk out, said Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth. 
Police negotiators talked Robb into surrendering about 10:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the police had talked Robb out of the room, word of the hostage 
situation had spread. Students were lined up to call their parents on the two 
pay phones outside the school office, and many of the girls were crying. 
</P>
<P>
"My son called me from here and said, 'Get me out of here. There's a shooting 
going on,' " said Jackie Blacketer, who waited for her son Brian along with 
other parents who said they had heard word of the shooting on the radio or from 
friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the school's 1,600 students remained in class for the rest of the day. 
Two psychologists were sent to the school to talk to students from the drama 
class, and three psychologists will be at the campus today, said Anaheim Union 
High School District Assistant Supt. Lee Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
Police and school officials provided few details about the incident and what 
might have led up to it. Family members refused to discuss the incident. 
Students and parents, some shaken by the ordeal, talked about what they knew of 
the young man and his problems. 
</P>
<P>
They described the brown-haired freshman as a troubled but friendly youth who 
fought bitterly with his stepfather and was upset about his family's impending 
move to Northern California. Several students, some of whom said they have 
known Robb for years, said Robb had also told them that his father, a Vietnam 
veteran, committed suicide, although that account could not be confirmed by 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
Several students said Robb had hinted for the past few weeks that he was 
planning some act involving weapons and possible violence. But they had not 
taken him seriously, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drama Class 
</P>
<P>
Nor did most of the students in the drama class at first take seriously the 
threat posed by Robb, dressed in jeans and a green T-shirt beneath a red-plaid 
flannel shirt, when he walked into the ampitheater-style classroom and ordered 
teacher Tuttle to get out. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle tried to take some students with him, Pam Lopez said, but Robb would not 
let him and ordered him to leave again. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle had been teaching the class -- in which Robb was not enrolled -- about 
the various parts of a theater stage, students said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was a joke," said ninth-grader Season Rodriguez, who was 
in the room. "He came in and kicked back, said 'I'm not gonna hurt you, don't 
worry.' I don't think Cory meant to go in there and shoot anyone." 
</P>
<P>
After Tuttle left, Robb -- who police said was armed with a .12-gauge, 
short-barreled shotgun and a semiautomatic handgun -- told the students that 
they could change seats and sit by their friends if they wanted to, said 
15-year-old Matt Grimsley. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kind of screwed around," Grimsley said. "Then he said he wanted to get 
back at his stepfather." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Lopez, said Season Rodriguez, mocked Robb, saying, " 'Oh, we've got a 
suicidal killer on our hands.' " Other students said Lopez told Robb he didn't 
believe the guns were real. 
</P>
<P>
Robb fired one shot in the classroom of 36 students, hitting Lopez in the face, 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
"He grabbed his face and fell down by my feet," Grimsley said. "There was blood 
everywhere. I went to help him, but he (Robb) said, 'Don't move.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another student talked Robb into allowing the girls -- who were crying and 
screaming after the shooting -- to leave, along with the wounded student, 
Grimsley said. Lopez was able to walk out under his own power, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With only about 10 boys remaining in the classroom, Robb used a phone at the 
teacher's desk to try to reach his mother, said Jimmy Hurley, another student 
in the class. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Hedgpeth said he did not know if Robb got through to his mother. Someone 
must have contacted her, he said, because she called police before her son 
surrendered. She came to the school but did not come onto the school grounds 
because of the crowd of reporters that had gathered near the entrance, Hedgpeth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police trained in hostage negotiations contacted Robb on the phone and 
talked him into surrendering at 10:10 a.m., Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Robb is being held at Orange County Juvenile Hall in Orange on charges of 
attempted murder, aggravated assault, bringing a firearm on campus, false 
imprisonment and hostage-taking, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
One student, 15-year-old Doney Philpott, said Robb told him Wednesday: " 
'Tomorrow's my last day. I'm going to come over here and do something bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Philpott said that when he asked Robb what he meant, Robb said he planned to 
come to school armed and have police call his stepfather to the school. 
Philpott said Robb told him that when his stepfather arrived, he would shoot 
him. "I didn't believe him," said Philpott, who attended Ball Junior High in 
Anaheim with Robb. "He used to say things like this all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Police said students they interviewed Thursday also told them of Robb's threats 
and plans. But they said none had been reported to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Several students said Robb had told them he often fought with his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
Damien Christian, who called himself "a good friend" of Robb, as did other 
students, said that Robb told him about his father's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"It was after he came back from Vietnam, he killed himself in front of Cory," 
Damien said. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said Robb told his son a similar 
story: that Robb's father had summoned his son to the attic one day and then 
shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
Robb's mother, Kathy Y. McAfee, declined to speak to a reporter at the family's 
house, which recently had been sold. Neighbors said Robb's stepfather, Paul D. 
McAfee, moved to Northern California for work reasons several months ago and 
that his wife and stepson planned to follow soon. 
</P>
<P>
"He had told my girls that he didn't want to move," said Renay Hill, who lives 
across the street from Robb. Robb showed one of her daughters -- who was in the 
drama class Thursday morning -- a gun Wednesday night, but did not say anything 
about using it, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Another parent, Linda Tucker, said Robb had been a classmate of her daughter's 
since elementary school, when she was a room mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe this. I know he got into trouble, but there are worse 
kids than him," she said. "He always called me 'Mrs. Tucker,' and not many kids 
do that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about other people doing things like this, but not a kid you've seen 
go to school since he was only this high," she said, putting her hand no higher 
than her waist. 
</P>
<P>
Robb's friend Damien Christian said that he sometimes played football or other 
games with Robb but that Robb "doesn't really get into sports." 
</P>
<P>
Christian said that Robb liked reading -- particularly Stephen King books and 
other horror fiction -- and he liked guns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Christian wondered: "Why would he do something like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Season Rodriguez, despite just having suffered through the ordeal, said she 
felt sorry for Robb. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he gets help," she said. "I feel bad for him." 
</P>
<P>
At UCI Medical Center, Anthony Lopez, too, looked disbelieving as he fingered 
the bandages wrapped around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony is the son of Lou Lopez, a resource school officer with the Anaheim 
Police Department, who is a school board candidate in the Anaheim City School 
District election Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a punch, the worst punch ever," Lopez said of the shot. "But I 
still didn't think I was hurt. I thought he fired a paint gun at me. . . . "

$7-BILLION BID BY TRUMP FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York real estate and gambling magnate Donald J. Trump bid more than $7 
billion Thursday for AMR Corp., parent of giant American Airlines, in what 
would be the largest airline deal in history. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's "unsolicited" offer of $120 in cash for each of AMR's nearly 60 million 
shares outstanding was viewed by some analysts as being too low a price for the 
airline, which is widely considered to be the industry's best managed and whose 
19% market share is the largest among U.S. air carriers. 
</P>
<P>
American is the leading airline serving Orange County, flying 35% of the daily 
flights to and from John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by AMR said that its board of directors would consider the 
offer "in due course" but indicated that it was likely to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant billionaire gave no details about how he would finance the deal 
but said he is prepared to commit at least $1 billion of his own money to the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
It is known that Dallas-based American has about $1 billion in cash in its 
treasury that could be used by Trump to help finance the deal. Moreover, 
American has been trying to sell half of its highly profitable Sabre 
computerized reservation system, for which it could receive $700 million to $1 
billion, and that money also would be available to Trump. 
</P>
<P>
But, whether or not Trump, who also owns what was once Eastern Airlines' 
lucrative Northeast air shuttle operation serving Washington, Boston and New 
York, is serious in his bid to take over American, he has put the big airline 
company "into play," Wall Street analysts said Thursday. Some said that Trump 
may just be trying to drive up the price of the stock so he can sell his shares 
at a large profit. 
</P>
<P>
Airline analysts maintained in interviews that American is worth at least $130 
a share and that, if a bidding war occurs, it might fetch $140 a share, which 
would make the deal worth about $8 billion. They predicted that similar bids 
soon will be made for Delta Air Lines and USAir Group, even though both have 
recently taken steps to protect themselves against takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street did not appear to have taken the Trump offer all that 
seriously. Although AMR stock was the day's most heavily traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 8,359,800 shares changing hands, the price per share was 
up only $16.875, closing at $99.875 -- far below Trump's bid price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financing Details Needed 
</P>
<P>
"All we have is a letter," said Thomas C. Longman, airline analyst with Bear, 
Stearns &amp; Co., a New York broker. "At this point, we have to get the 
details of Trump's financing plans to see how serious an offer this is." 
</P>
<P>
Trump said in a letter to AMR's board of directors that he would be able to 
obtain the financing "in a reasonable period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Marckesano, airline analyst with the Philadelphia brokerage firm of 
Janney Montgomery Scott, said: "If anyone would be able to finance such a deal, 
Trump would have the wherewithal. But we are not talking small change like what 
he paid for the shuttle ($365 million)." 
</P>
<P>
The Trump offer, which has been rumored since it became known several weeks ago 
that the financier had bought an interest in AMR, comes at a time when federal 
regulators are expressing concern about the heavy debt loads taken on by U.S. 
airlines in recent purchases. 
</P>
<P>
NWA Corp., parent of Northwest Airlines, was recently bought for $4.05 billion 
by a group of investors headed by Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi. A 
$6.75-billion management-employee offer for UAL Corp., parent of United 
Airlines, is currently under consideration. These so-called leveraged buyouts 
are new to the airline industry, which in the previous five years had seen a 
frenzy of airline mergers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Have White Knight 
</P>
<P>
As AMR watched the NWA and UAL transactions, Marckesano said, it most probably 
prepared itself to fend off an unfriendly bid. "They might have a white knight, 
somebody who has said to (AMR Chairman Robert L.) Crandall: 'Let me know if you 
need any help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marckesano said that, as another defensive measure, AMR could make a bid for 
Pan Am Corp., or let Pan Am make a bid for AMR "so as to take on a great amount 
of debt." Such debt would make AMR much less attractive as a takeover target. 
American now has one of the best balance sheets in the airline industry, with 
only 37% debt to total capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
American said in a terse announcement after receiving Trump's offer that "there 
has been no change . . . in the policy and belief" that AMR and its 
shareholders will be best served by AMR's remaining an independent company and 
"continuing the strong partnership among American Airlines, its employees, the 
communities it serves and the public -- a partnership that has given AMR the 
great success it enjoys today." 
</P>
<P>
The company has had healthy profits. In the six months that ended on June 30, 
its net earnings rose to $278.9 million from $209.8 million during the same 
period last year. Total revenues rose to $5.17 billion in the first six months 
of 1989 from $4.13 billion in the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Ordered New Planes 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 1/2 years, AMR has placed orders and options for more than $23 
billion worth of airliners for American Airlines and for American Eagle, its 
commuter subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the AMR board, Trump said his offer to buy the company will 
expire on Oct. 20 unless he extends it. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said it is his intention to acquire AMR in a "negotiated transaction. In 
this regard, my proposal is subject to the execution of a mutually satisfactory 
definitive acquisition agreement." 
</P>
<P>
He said also, "In recognition of the outstanding job done by company 
management, I would hope that, following an acquisition of the company by me, 
operating management would continue to work with me to build on the company's 
reputation as the premier airline in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
But it is questionable whether the American management team would remain under 
Trump. According to Kevin C. Murphy, airline analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; 
Co., another big broker, AMR has termination benefit agreements with nine top 
executive officers. Crandall has been given options on 355,000 shares of stock 
worth $46 million, assuming the stock is valued at $130 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Appeal and a Threat 
</P>
<P>
The Trump letter contained both an appeal to stockholders and a veiled threat 
to management. 
</P>
<P>
"While I share your vision of the future for the airline," he said, "and I 
admire the values that have been created for the company's shareholders, I 
believe that the shareholders of the company should be given an opportunity to 
decide whether now is an appropriate time to realize those values." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "While I appreciate that the seemingly patterned response to letters 
such as this is one of immediate rejection and vilification of the author, I 
ask you, can such a response genuinely be in the interests of the company's 
shareholders who, as you are aware, have received no dividends on their shares 
for many years?" 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the company considers itself to be a capital-intensive firm 
and prefers to reinvest its profits in assets such as new airliners rather than 
paying them out in dividends. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite AMR's expression of its intention to remain independent, it is not 
altogether out of the question that some kind of compromise could be worked 
out, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not call this a hostile bid," said Timothy Pettee, airline analyst 
with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, a New York-based broker. "Of 
course, it is unwanted, but that does not preclude a friendly agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Pettee said Crandall and Trump probably would not get along well together. 
</P>
<P>
"Crandall is not used to reporting to anybody," he said. "But Trump is an 
investor, not a manager." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Trump, who named the Eastern shuttle after himself when he 
acquired it in June, would not be likely to do that with American. "The Plaza 
(Hotel in New York) had a name, and he was smart enough not to rename that."

D.A. TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY AGAINST 3 IN DRIVE-BY SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office will seek the death penalty 
against three alleged members of Santa Ana's 5th Street gang who are charged 
with murdering two people in one of the worst drive-by shootings in Orange 
County history, the prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef said he will file an amended complaint today 
adding the special circumstance of multiple murder against Louis Palomino 
Valadez, Robert Phillip Figueroa and Roman Gabriel Menchaca, all of Santa Ana. 
The multiple-murder allegation means that the men could be sentenced to death 
if they are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth suspect, a 14-year-old Santa Ana boy who police have said was one of 
two alleged triggermen in the Sept. 16 murders in Garden Grove, cannot legally 
be sentenced to death or tried as an adult, Avdeef said. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that Thursday's arrests of 5th Street gang members may trigger 
retribution by their comrades against rival 17th Street gang members, Garden 
Grove and Santa Ana police stepped up their patrols of the two turfs, but they 
have picked up no hint of impending violence, said Garden Grove Police Sgt. 
Phil Mason, who is directing the murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our gang detail is keeping its ear to the ground," Mason said Thursday. "But 
it's like trying to read smoke signals in the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Police have been interviewing the four defendants, but they show no willingness 
to cooperate, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Valadez, 28; Figueroa, 20; Menchaca, 19, and the 14-year-old boy gang member 
are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit murder, two counts of 
first-degree murder, 11 counts of attempted murder and one count of street 
terrorism. The three adults were scheduled to be arraigned today in West 
Municipal Court in Westminster. The 14-year-old boy, whose name was withheld 
because of his age, faces a detention hearing in Juvenile Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe that Menchaca and the 14-year-old crouched in the back 
of a moving red pickup truck and sprayed semiautomatic gunfire into a cluster 
of 13 people gathered outside a Garden Grove home on Sept 16. Police believe 
that Valadez owned and drove the truck and that Figueroa was a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Even though there appear to have been only two triggermen, Mason said the 
conspiracy and murder charges are warranted against all four because police 
believe that they plotted the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The bullets killed Miguel (Smokey) Navarro, 17, a member of the rival 17th 
Street gang, and 4-year-old Frank Fernandez Jr. At least six others were 
wounded, including the toddler's mother, aunt, and 2-year-old brother, as well 
as a 26-year-old man who lost his leg due to bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Albert Martinez, 20, a fifth purported gang member who was arrested 
during Thursday's raids when police found several guns in his Santa Ana home, 
is not a suspect in the homicides, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez was being held on suspicion of possessing a gun without a serial 
number and child endangerment for keeping loaded weapons within reach of his 2 
1/2-year-old daughter, Mason said. He was to be arraigned today along with the 
three others in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Police have ordered ballistics tests on the gun to determine if it was one of 
two murder weapons, but they did not expect to have the results for at least 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who is Valadez's nephew, was shot in the chest during a drive-by 
shooting in Santa Ana a week before the Garden Grove murders. Police have 
speculated that the Sept. 16 attack might have been retribution for Martinez's 
wounding.

HEART 'TIME-SHARING' TACTIC SUCCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors at a Mission Viejo hospital Thursday used a new surgical procedure -- 
never before tried in Orange County -- to lower the risk for a 74-year-old 
patient undergoing heart bypass surgery for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
"The patient is doing just fine," said a very pleased Dr. Donald E. Rediker, 
who performed the new technique at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. "I 
think we're going to see this procedure used more and more in high-risk cases." 
</P>
<P>
The procedure -- called coronary venous retroperfusion -- essentially involved 
placing a small catheter into a heart vein. It pumped oxygenated blood backward 
through the vein to keep the heart functioning while bypass surgery took place. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Pape of Old Rancho Santa Margarita, who sings in a local barbershop 
quartet, had suffered chest pains in recent weeks, primarily because of 
complications from previous bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A new bypass was needed. But it was risky, Rediker said, partly because of 
Pape's age and the condition of his arteries. 
</P>
<P>
The new technique was needed to keep Pape's heart strong enough to sustain 
another operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We explained to him what we wanted to do, and how it had not been done here 
before; he was quite willing to try it," Rediker said. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor added: "Mr. Pape was smiling and conscious" while the equipment was 
being inserted before the surgery. "It was really not complicated." 
</P>
<P>
Rediker said the doctors conducted tests to prove that the equipment was 
keeping Pape's heart going during the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no way to prove that Pape would not have survived the surgery 
without the technique, Rediker said: "It is certainly quite clear that the 
risks would have been much much greater." 
</P>
<P>
In layman's terms, the new equipment makes the veins serve as arteries while 
the arteries are under repair. While blood nobmally leaves the heart through 
the veins, with this procedure the veins spend part of the time taking blood 
back to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it time-sharing," quipped David Pound, a spokesman for Retroperfusion 
Systems Inc. of Costa Mesa, which manufactures the equipment used in the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't correct the problem, but it gives the doctors more time to do their 
job. One doctor called it a lifeboat for the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Pound said the greatest value for the procedure might be in cases where someone 
suffers a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation might be so critical," he said, "that a doctor has only a couple 
of hours' time to perform surgery before the patient would die. With this 
equipment, the surgeon might buy up to eight to 10 hours." 
</P>
<P>
With more than a million heart attacks in this country each year, Pound 
predicted that new techniques such as this one could save thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
Rediker conducted the catheter procedure with aid from Dr. Gregory S. Thomas, 
Pape's cardiologist. The actual bypass surgery was performed by Dr. William N. 
Thibault and Dr. Robert A. Steedman. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure was developed by Dr. Eliot Corday and associates at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 
the procedure at a dozen centers around the country, Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
It was recently approved for Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center for a 
two-year trial. 
</P>
<P>
Pound was an observer during Pape's surgery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been there for several weeks getting ready, training the nurses and the 
staff in what to do," Pound said. "It really was kind of exciting for 
everyone."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SUIT SEEKS TO FORCE SALE OF BEACHFRONT BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is considering legal action to force the owners of a beachfront 
hamburger stand to sell their property. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, voted 6 to 1 this week to 
authorize filing suit to condemn Wimpi's on Pacific Coast Highway and 5th 
Street if negotiations to buy the property remain deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Wimpi's is inside Huntington Beach's downtown redevelopment area. Its land is 
needed before the second phase of the project can move ahead, City 
Administrator Paul Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been negotiating with three property owners for about two years 
and needs to move ahead to force the sale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The owners are willing to sell the land but not at a price the city is 
offering, said Charles Sarrabere, 78, who owns the land with his sister and 
niece. Sarrabere said he grew up on that property, where his parents bought a 
house about 1920. 
</P>
<P>
The land is a prime piece of beachfront property on a well-traveled street and 
is worth much more than the city has offered, Sarrabere said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to gig anybody," he said. "But at the same time, I'm trying 
to get paid." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell voted against authorizing condemnation because of 
the owners' many years in the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city probably will not have to condemn the property, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has filed suit in the past to take property in the 
redevelopment area, he said, agreements have always been reached.

<P>
STUDY TO CONSIDER REDEVELOPMENT FOR MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has ordered a study to determine whether the Buena Park Mall 
should be included in a possible redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
The council this week approved a resolution calling for a 30-day study to 
determine the feasibility of improvements to the 25-year-old mall, owned and 
managed by City Freeholds (USA) Inc. 
</P>
<P>
According to May Wong Hui, the city's economic development manager, the study 
will be conducted by GRC Redevelopment Consultants, a Claremont firm 
specializing in creating project areas. The study will determine what type of 
aid the city could offer in accordance with redevelopment guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
David Souers, executive vice president of City Freeholds, expressed interest in 
the city's plan but said mall owners are planning to make improvements "one way 
or the other." These improvements are expected to begin near the first of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Mall was built in 1962, with Sears &amp; Roebuck becoming the first 
big tenant. City Freeholds bought the mall in 1976 and in 1980 added a second 
level and 100 more shops. In 1984, eight new theaters and 20 more merchants 
were included. 
</P>
<P>
Souers said he expected the city to offer aid in areas such as off-site 
improvements but added that possible action is still only being discussed.

landscaped parking lot for Cal State Fullerton," said Frances Shropshire, 
Arborfest coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The event will run from 10 a.m to 4 p.m. It is sponsored by Friends of 
Fullerton Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be free tours of Heritage House, a restored 19th-Century home 
on the arboretum grounds.

The city has retained "some of the most creative and innovative design and

COMMISSION ACCUSES STATE SENATE CANDIDATE OF 400 ILLEGAL MAILINGS

The Fair Political Practices Commission has accused Republican state Senate 
candidate Don Knabe of sending out an illegal mailing to 400 disabled veterans 
in his unsuccessful 1988 bid to defeat Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk), who 
represents western Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the final weeks of the campaign, Knabe, a former Cerritos city councilman 
and chief deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, sent out a 
letter by Sherman E. Roodzant, past national commander of American Disabled 
Veterans. The letter attacked Green for "callous misuse of the American flag" 
and "blatant disregard for America's veterans." 
</P>
<P>
The letter indicated in small type that the mailing was paid for by Knabe's 
campaign, but the law requires full identification of the sender on the 
envelope as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised at the tenacity (of the Fair Political Practices Commission) 
over 400 envelopes," said Knabe, who blamed the problem on a printer's 
oversight. "It is really, as Chick Hearn would say, 'ticky-tacky.' " 
</P>
<P>
If the commission upholds the charge, Knabe could be fined up to $2,000.

A STORIED ATHLETE, OSCAR WILSON'S GREATEST CHALLENGES ARE OFF THE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems everyone has a favorite story about Oscar Wilson, Santa Ana High 
School's gifted lineman who is a unique package of power, speed and strength. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Jesse Rosas remembers watching Wilson dunk a basketball as a 
sixth-grader at Spurgeon Intermediate School and saying, "There's no way this 
guy is in the sixth grade." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Bill Haley remembers Wilson reporting for freshman football 
practice at Santa Ana and telling him, "I want to be a tackle." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson showed he could tackle. He hit three opponents so hard, they were out 
for the season with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like watching the bulls run at Pamplona," one coach said. "Opposing 
linemen were afraid to block him. Defensive backs wouldn't dare try to tackle 
him in the open field." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reames, Foothill basketball coach, says Wilson's most impressive display 
came as a sophomore in the Southern Section basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana played host to Simi Valley in the semifinals. With Simi Valley 
comfortably ahead in the final minute, Wilson stole a pass and drove for what 
many believed would be a sure-fire dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wilson stopped at the free-throw line, tossed the ball to the 
backboard, and in one motion, grabbed the rebound and slammed the ball through 
the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
"He completed the act with authority," Reames said. "That play showed me this 
guy is really talented." 
</P>
<P>
And there was Wilson's way of ending a frustrating evening against the nation's 
top-ranked prep football team, Loyola, in a 27-0 loss last year. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola had been running the ball away from Wilson all night. Finally, Wilson 
grabbed an opposing blocker, almost lifting him off the ground, and pushed him 
aside. Once in Loyola's backfield, he tackled the quarterback and running back 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"In 13 years of coaching, I've never seen a more awesome display of strength," 
said Steve Grady, Loyola coach. 
</P>
<P>
The stories are endless. Wilson, 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, has been a man 
playing with boys since the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilson has had few rivals on an athletic field, he has struggled most 
of his life to catch up to his peers in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson couldn't read or write when he entered the third grade at Jackson 
Elementary School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't listen to anybody . . . teachers, my parents, anybody," Wilson said. 
"All I wanted to do was play sports. I missed out on a lot of things, and ended 
up playing catch-up in the classroom for the next five years." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was placed in a special education program under Gail King-Burney at 
Jackson Elementary from the third to fifth grades. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a mean, tough little guy who was very resistant to anything you tried 
to teach him," King-Burney said. "He had very low skills, so we had to go back 
to the basics. It was very difficult because of his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to build on his self-esteem. He had the ability, but he lacked the 
desire to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made slow but steady progress under King-Burney to the point where she 
said, "He was ready for the sixth grade." Wilson entered Spurgeon Intermediate 
School, and later was reunited with King-Burney, at Spurgeon, in the seventh 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
"He had regressed because the level of caring dropped," King-Burney said. "It 
was easier dealing with him the second time around because he knew exactly who 
I was and what was expected of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Oscar gained the confidence to do his schoolwork in the seventh grade. 
He went through hell and back. But I think he's going to make it in the college 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has completed his core classes of mathematics, foreign language, lab 
science, etc., at Santa Ana High. Along the way, he has made some lasting 
impressions on his teachers and classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Hays, who taught Wilson in her Spanish II class last year, describes him as 
a "gentle giant" and remembers persuading one of her students to join a 
group-learning team with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I placed her in the same group with Oscar and later she asked if she could 
change groups," Hays said. "She said she was afraid of him. I asked her why, 
and she said, 'Because he's so big.' 
</P>
<P>
"I knew things would work out because Oscar is essentially a pussy cat. Three 
days later, the girl told me, 'Mrs. Hays, you were right. He's terrific.' She 
ended up tutoring Oscar for the rest of year." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's goal is to earn a Division I college scholarship. The next hurdle is 
passing the Scholastic Aptitude Test. He failed to score the minimum 
requirement of 700 points on his first try. 
</P>
<P>
"The test is hard, but I've got to pass it," Wilson said. "It's another 
challenge, and I like challenges. I've got a lot of people counting on me who 
have helped me get this far. I'm not going to let them down."

STARTING OVER; 
</P>
<P>
IN FIRST VARSITY JOB, JEFF BUENAFE TURNS AROUND GARDEN GROVE'S FOOTBALL 
FORTUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How does a math teacher with no varsity coaching experience land the head 
coaching job at Garden Grove High School? 
</P>
<P>
Well, take a football program that had not made a playoff appearance in six 
years. Subtract a varsity coach who, coming off a 1-9 season, quits one week 
before the 1988 season. Add only 16 players out for varsity and factor in Jeff 
Buenafe, an exuberant, sincere math teacher with some athletic experience. 
</P>
<P>
The odds for improvement seem as likely as catching a glimpse of an imaginary 
number, right? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, Garden Grove has ended Orange County's longest losing streak of 
the decade and won its first Garden Grove League game in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts (3-1, 1-0) will try to win their first homecoming game in five 
seasons when they play host to Los Amigos at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Buenafe, a three-sport star at Rancho Alamitos, attended USC, where he played 
baseball, graduating in 1976 with a degree in public administration. 
</P>
<P>
Buenafe quit a public relations job with an airline in 1983 to earn a teaching 
credential from UC Irvine so he could spend more time with his family. He 
coached the Rancho Alamitos sophomore football team to the league championship 
in 1985 and spent the 1987-88 season as an assistant to Garden Grove varsity 
Coach Larry Hirt. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches weren't exactly beating down the door to take over when Hirt resigned a 
week before the season started. And when Buenafe, the projected freshman coach, 
volunteered to take over as interim coach, Athletic Director Ron Zajec 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff's father, Al Buenafe, 60, a former successful football coach at Mt. 
Whitney High in Visalia and a one-time principal at Pacifica, cautioned his son 
about taking the job at Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him you better weigh everything very carefully," Al Buenafe said. "We 
talked about him inheriting a program that virtually had died." Jeff weighed 
the pros and cons with his dad: There were only 16 varsity players and two 
coaches returning from a 1-9 team. There would be a lot of time spent away from 
his wife, Barb, and their children, Matthew, 9, Sarah, 7, and Michael, 3. 
</P>
<P>
What tipped the scales for Jeff Buenafe was his loyalty to the players. "He 
felt a real responsibility to the kids here at school and I guess he was 
positive enough to think he could get some kids out for the team," Al Buenafe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Buenafe then began rebuilding the program from the ground up, literally. 
He went on a recruiting spree, talking to kids at their jobs and calling them 
at home, and eventually boosted his squad to 24. He also recruited a coaching 
staff that included his father. He and his staff cleaned, painted and 
recarpeted the coaches' offices and the weight-training and first-aid rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The process of building morale, however, was not as easy. 
</P>
<P>
The athletes were confused and down about losing Hirt. Nobody had lifted 
weights, ran or participated in summer passing leagues, and the student body 
wasn't particularly supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to class after game days was always the worst," said Ralph 
Stevens, the Argonauts' defensive back and receiver coach. "Kids would ask how 
much we got beat by, not whether we won or lost." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Squyres, an all-league selection at wide receiver last season as a 
junior: "I took pride in being a Garden Grove football player because I gave 
all that I could all the time, but it was kind of hard because I would be out 
somewhere and I wouldn't want to boast about being a Garden Grove football 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Argonauts went 0-10 under Buenafe, extending their losing streak to 
a record 19 games, Athletic Director Zajec remained a strong supporter. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew no matter who we hired last year it would have been a difficult year 
for them. So we hired Jeff as a look into the future, because we knew what he 
could do for the kids. He cares about his kids and he works hard for them." 
</P>
<P>
Buenafe has a reputation for being upbeat. He does not yell, scream, rant or 
rave. He discusses and supports. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets more from his kids with honey, so-to-speak, than I ever did with a big 
stick," Al Buenafe said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his optimistic nature, Jeff Buenafe said he remembers a lot of dark 
nights and a lot of dark days, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I was really second-guessing myself as a coach," Buenafe said. 
"I just felt like I was being dealt a bad deck in a sense. We got off to the 
slowest and worst start of any team in the county." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of coaches would not have come back after an 0-10 season. But Buenafe was 
building something at Garden Grove and he wanted to see it through. He had 
succeeded in building a better team attitude, if not a better record. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his first season, Buenafe gathered his team together and told 
them, "You have all been blessed with certain talents, and if you really want 
to be successful, you're going to have to do whatever it takes to get 
yourselves physically and mentally prepared to play football." 
</P>
<P>
It was then that this season's team motto -- Whatever It Takes -- was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember seeing in their eyes looks of amazement, fear and 
determination," Buenafe said. "I think they knew then they were going to have a 
coach and coaching staff that wasn't going to duck out on them." 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts are young -- 17 of 22 starters, including quarterback Bob Ioja, 
are juniors. But that has not stopped them from winning more games this season 
than they have in two years. 
</P>
<P>
And most of the success can be attributed to Buenafe, who has more than 40 
players on the squad this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Buenafe probably is the last person anyone watching a Garden Grove practice 
would point to as the coach. On the practice field, he sports black and white 
leather loafers with shiny silver pants. He also wears his T-shirts the trendy 
way -- ripped a bit at the collar, the short sleeves rolled up twice. 
</P>
<P>
It comes "just from playing sports and just getting sweaty and dirty and 
wanting to be comfortable," Buenafe said. 
</P>
<P>
Things are a lot more comfortable for Garden Grove players and coaches this 
season, too. And they stand to get more comfortable in the future. 
</P>

KENNEDY TOPS BOLSA GRANDE BY CAPITALIZING ON TURNOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kennedy High School, taking advantage of several turnovers, defeated Bolsa 
Grande, 23-10, in Garden Grove League play before 200 Thursday night at Bolsa 
Grande. 
</P>
<P>
After a less-than-stellar performance against Rancho Alamitos last week, 
Kennedy (2-3, 1-1) made amends by holding Bolsa Grande (2-3, 1-1) to seven 
yards rushing and 64 total yards in the first half, intercepting Bolsa 
quarterback Sonny Nguyen twice and recovering four of five Bolsa Grande 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish amassed 197 yards in the first half, 124 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the whole difference in the ball game," Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson 
said. "They gave us the ball a lot and we played a pretty good game. The kids 
were fired up. They played tough and were able to capitalize." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored in two plays after Jason Mehr recovered Bolsa Grande's first 
fumble at the Matador 15. Vince Church got all 15 yards. He scored on an 
eight-yard run to put Kennedy ahead, 7-0, late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy went ahead, 14-3, after quarterback Russ Clark, who completed 10 of 17 
passes for 104 yards and an interception, broke away for a 65-yard touchdown 
run off a busted play. On third down, Clark dropped back to pass from his 35 
but his receivers were covered. He was chased out of the pocket, and scrambled 
to the sideline before outrunning the Bolsa Grande defense to the end zone. 
Clark ended up with 80 yards in six carries. Church carried 16 times for 45 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored once more in the half, again with help from Bolsa Grande. 
Matador quarterback Nguyen fumbled the ball out of his end zone for a safety 
and Kennedy took a 16-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa's smaller line had trouble running against Kennedy's size. Fighting Irish 
linebacker Keith Sewell, who last week set a school record with 30 tackles, was 
one of the main reasons for the Matadors' troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen mounted a drive early in the second quarter moving the Matadors from 
their 34 to the Kennedy 5. Key plays included a 19-yard completion to Jim 
Hanson and a 19-yard run by Carlos Torres. A pitch to Torres appeared to be a 
touchdown but the play was called back on a 15-yard illegal blocking penalty by 
Bolsa Grande. The Matadors settled for a 27-yard field goal by Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Nguyen and Torres missed the connection on a handoff, 
setting up the third Kennedy score off a fumble. The Fighting Irish recovered 
at Bolsa Grande's 44 and eventually scored on Church's one-yard run for a 23-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa had an opportunity to score late in the fourth after Nguyen's 43-yard 
completion to Trent Wood (seven catches, 108 yards) moved the Matadors to the 
Fighting Irish 17, but Marvin Dayao picked off Nguyen's next pass. 
</P>
<P>
With about a minute remaining, Bolsa finally made it into the end zone when 
Raul DeHesa returned a kickoff 68 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen completed 12 of 27 passes for 149 yards and two interceptions.

CYPRESS ROLLS PAST MAGNOLIA, 22-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cypress High School scored 15 points in the fourth quarter en route to a 22-0 
victory over winless Magnolia Thursday night in Handel Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions took a 7-0 lead with five minutes remaining in the half on a 
four-yard run by Brian Dawson. Cypress did not score again until two plays into 
the fourth quarter on a three-yard run by Sundance Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress increased its lead with 7:31 to play when Richard Parsons blocked a 
punt by Scott Crawford, and the ball bounced out of the end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
After the Centurions (2-3) took over on an interception, Sean Dangaran sprinted 
60 yards for a touchdown with 41 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia (0-5) was held to 80 yards total offense. Sentinel quarterback Elliot 
Parker completed just two of 18 passes for 32 yards with two interceptions.

EL MODENA MUST SETTLE FOR 14-14 TIE; 
</P>
<P>
MISSED FIELD GOAL BY VANGUARDS CAPS FRUSTRATING NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive week, El Modena High School let a victory slip out 
of its hands in the final minutes. But Thursday night at Glover Stadium, the 
Vanguards' grip appeared assuredly tight. 
</P>
<P>
With four seconds remaining and the Vanguards tied with Loara, 14-14, Greg 
Lewis missed a field goal attempt of 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was a frustrating finish to a frustrating game for El Modena (1-3-1). On 
three occasions the Vanguards had the ball within Loara's five-yard line and 
failed to score. El Modena ran four consecutive running plays from the Loara 
two in one series and could only gain a yard. And as the first half ended, 
Lewis missed a 22-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a rough couple of weeks for the Vanguards. Last week, they were 
beaten by Fountain Valley, 21-20, on a touchdown drive in the game's waning 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This week, it looked as if things would be different, because El Modena was 
doing the rallying. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:20 remaining to play, quarterback Adam Garcia led the charge, taking his 
team from its 27 to the Loara four before Lewis' kick missed its mark. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia had either an arm or two legs in every one of the yards El Modena gained 
on the drive, including a 14-yard scramble and pass completions of 18 and 11 
yards to Graham Brown. Garcia finished 14 of 23 for 187 yards and one 
touchdown. He carried the ball 16 times for 62 yards and a two-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Coy Collins had another big game for Loara (4-0-1), gaining 168 yards in 14 
carries and scoring twice. His 96-yard run in the fourth quarter put Loara 
ahead, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
But all was not well for Loara, either. Numerous long penalties in the second 
half stalled Saxon drives. In total, Loara was penalized six times for 80 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We got ourselves in such holes all the time with penalties, penalties, 
penalties, and we just couldn't do it," said Herb Hill, Loara coach. 
</P>
<P>
One of the penalties was especially vexing. The Saxons were called for 
clipping, nullifying a 91-yard kickoff return by Collins for a touchdown. A 
Loara player pushed an El Modena player in the back long after Collins had 
streaked down the center of the field.

TRABUCO HILLS GOES TO WORK QUICKLY; 
</P>
<P>
MUSTANGS TAKE 24-0 HALFTIME LEAD, COAST PAST VILLA PARK 
</P>

<P>
Tim Manning's first pass went incomplete. His second was caught by Greg Hughes 
for a 41-yard gain. After an illegal procedure penalty, Manning completed a 
44-yard pass to Julian Ford for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Only three plays into Trabuco Hills High School's nonleague game against Villa 
Park Thursday night, and the Mustangs led by a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It got worse, never better, for Villa Park as Trabuco Hills went on to a 24-0 
victory in front of 1,000 at El Modena's Fred Kelly Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Manning, Trabuco Hills' senior quarterback, completed 12 of 25 passes for 228 
yards and three touchdowns. Trabuco Hills (4-1) added a 37-yard field goal by 
Hughes for a 24-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park (3-2) never had a chance, victimized by two intercepted passes 
thrown by quarterback Jason Martian and four fumbles, two each by running backs 
Gary Bladow and Craig Moresco. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans had only one chance to score and that fizzled when they were 
stopped on fourth and one at the Trabuco Hills three-yard line late in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive game Villa Park had been shut out. The Spartans 
lost, 15-0, to Orange last week after knocking off Los Alamitos, then Orange 
County's top-ranked team, two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the victory over Los Alamitos was the high point of Villa Park's season, the 
low point surely came Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Down 24-0 at halftime, the Spartans came out roaring in the third quarter . . . 
and promptly fumbled on their first series. They fumbled again on their second 
possession. On their third, they punted and by then Trabuco Hills had things 
well in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Villa Park is a good team," said Jim Barnett, Trabuco Hills coach. "If we 
hadn't gotten the jump on them early, it might have been different. If they 
hadn't had those turnovers, it might have been different." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park came out playing a tight, blitzing defense, leaving its defensive 
backs to cover the Trabuco Hills receivers man-to-man. 
</P>
<P>
Manning threw that strategy for a loop. He struck quickly on the Mustangs' 
first possession for a touchdown. In the second quarter, he hit Rick Sparks for 
touchdown passes of 29 and 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically going with a post pattern, trying to mix up their DBs," 
Manning said. "Barnett can pick apart a defense like no one I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park held Trabuco Hills scoreless in the second half as the Mustangs 
played it conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Burke gained 46 yards in 12 carries to key the Mustangs' running attack. 
They were without leading rusher Ben Rooker, who injured his knee against Dana 
Hills three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bladow gained 83 yards in 19 carries and Martian completed six of 12 passes for 
93 yards to highlight a dreary evening for Villa Park.

LAGUNA HILLS RUNS OVER ARTESIA, 13-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strong rushing attack and consistent defense led Laguna Hills High School to 
13-7 nonleague victory over Artesia Thursday at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
Marwan Saba and Darrin Chapman combined to gain 179 yards in 33 carries for 
Laguna Hills (2-3). Laguna Hills attempted only six passes, completing one for 
32 yards. Laguna Hills rushed 44 times for 193 yards and two touchdowns, 
finishing with 225 yards total offense. Saba finished with 121 yards to 
increase his season total to 423. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman scored Laguna Hills' first touchdown on a seven-yard run with 3:24 
remaining in the second quarter. The 34-yard drive was set up by Brad Grebel's 
fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills increased its lead to 13-0 in the fourth quarter on quarterback 
Mark Wells' four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills' defense, led by lineman Dusty Christensen and Christian Ritz and 
linebackers Craig Riggs and Aric Roman, limited Artesia to 96 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia (1-4) gained 72 of its 167 yards on a touchdown drive late in the game, 
which was capped by David Olivas' 10-yard pass to Robert Matos with 3:05 left.

CONVICTED EX-S&amp;L OWNER JAILED TO PREVENT HIS FLEEING

One day after he was found guilty of bank fraud and conspiracy, a former owner 
of an Orange thrift was sent to prison Thursday by a federal judge after 
prosecutors said they were worried he might flee the country given his past 
conviction for passport fraud. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon lifted the $600,000 bail on John L. 
Molinaro and ordered he be taken to Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles. Molinaro cursed deputy marshals as they handcuffed him and led him 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro, 48, had been convicted Wednesday on 33 charges of bank fraud, 
conspiracy and causing false entries to be put into the books of Ramona Savings 
&amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in an 11-week trial concluded that Molinaro and former co-owner Donald 
P. Mangano Sr. had carried out a scheme to defraud Ramona of millions of 
dollars. Mangano was convicted on 31 charges of bank fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona collapsed in 1986 and subsequently required a $65.5-million bailout of 
depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro, a former carpet salesman, served nearly two years in prison after he 
tried to obtain a passport in 1986 using the birth certificate of a dead man. 
Federal authorities, who have recovered $3 million from accounts Molinaro set 
up in the Caribbean, allege in court papers that he was planning on fleeing the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the Ramona case feared he might make another attempt to leave 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano, 52, remained free on $150,000 bail. He was ordered Thursday to remain 
within the Los Angeles area until sentencing, which was rescheduled for Jan. 8. 
Molinaro faces up to 165 years in prison and $8.3 million in fines; Mangano 
could receive a 155-year sentence and $7.8 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon also instructed Mangano not to talk to any of the people who testified 
during the trial.

DOWNEY'S STOCK HITS 12-MONTH HIGH; FOURTH STOCK SPLIT IN 5 YEARS CREDITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Stock in Downey Savings &amp; Loan is fetching its highest price of the last 12 
months, and the Newport Beach thrift is hoping to generate even more interest 
with a 3-for-2 stock split, its fourth such split in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's stock closed Thursday at $34.75 a share, 12.5 cents a share higher 
than Tuesday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has been 
climbing steadily through much of the summer but jumped more than $4 a share 
since the stock split was announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Stock splits help companies generate investor interest by increasing the number 
of shares available for trading and lowering the stock price after the split. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's two co-founders, Maurice L. McAlister and Gerald H. McQuarrie, control 
37.8% of the S&amp;L's stock and, together with remaining longtime directors, 
control about 45% of the stock. Once institutional investors are included, the 
public can dabble in only 25% to 30% of the shares, a Downey spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest stock split will give shareholders of record Thursday three shares 
for every two they hold, increasing the total shares outstanding to more than 
16.1 million. The shares will be distributed Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first of its series of 3-for-2 splits in December, 1984, Downey had 
a little more than 4.7 million shares outstanding.

4 TAKE CONTROL OF AILING S&amp;L IN WESTMINSTER; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESSMEN, DELTA BOARD PUT IN $2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four Korean businessmen took control of foundering Delta Savings Bank and, 
together with current directors, infused $2 million in cash into the 
Westminster institution to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
Delta, which saw its capital base eroding in the last year, now has more than 
enough capital to support its $60 million in assets and to meet tougher 
regulatory requirements, according to Chong Ho Rim, a certified public 
accountant who took over this week as Delta's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Rim replaced Robert Laddaga, who resigned to take a job at Brookside Savings 
&amp; Loan in Los Angeles. Laddaga left last Friday when regulators approved 
the change in control. 
</P>
<P>
Another investor, Young Il Kim, a banker and accountant, took over this week as 
president, replacing Joseph Gaskill, who, as one of the largest shareholders, 
became a consultant to Delta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expected to Be Chairman 
</P>
<P>
Another investor, Yun Suk Seo, an owner of a string of restaurants, is expected 
to be elected chairman, a post that has long been vacant. The fourth investor 
is Michael Kim, who owns a garment-manufacturing operation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Delta has long catered to the county's Vietnamese community known as Little 
Saigon, but Rim said the S&amp;L has been trying to reach out to the rest of 
the city through a branch on Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
Delta's financial problems stem from loans that went sour as long as six years 
ago. But it was a constant change in management and an unwieldy board of 
directors, which had 15 members, that was at the root of Delta's woes, Rim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every board member had divergent points of view on how to solve Delta's 
problems," he said. "And within seven years, it had six or seven presidents, 
which is hard because any organization needs a sense of continuity." 
</P>
<P>
In the 18 months before it opened in 1982, Delta's organizers saw the community 
along Bolsa Avenue grow dramatically to become a center for Vietnamese 
immigrants. They quickly changed the proposed name of the S&amp;L from Beach 
Cities to Delta -- for Indochina's Mekong Delta -- and added Vietnamese 
businessmen to the board, expanding it to 15 members. The board was trimmed 
earlier this year to 11 members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Limited to 7 
</P>
<P>
The new board is limited to seven members -- the four new investors and three 
Vietnamese nationals from the old board. The three holdovers are Drs. Minh Ngoc 
Dang and Ba Xuzn Nguyen and businessman Ban Bing Bui. 
</P>
<P>
Rim credited Gaskill with helping to hold the institution together as 
regulators severely restricted its lending operations and directors looked for 
new investors. 
</P>
<P>
Delta lost $333,000 in the first six months of this year, and at the end of 
July it had only $667,000 in capital, its final reserve against losses. That 
represented about a third of the capital level that regulators require.

SANTA ANA FIRM BUYS RADIO OUTLET, PLANS SPANISH FORMAT

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana broadcasting company has bought KRTH-AM for $23 million in an 
all-cash deal and plans to change the Los Angeles radio station's format from 
oldies rock to Spanish-language music. 
</P>
<P>
Liberman Broadcasting Inc. will separate KRTH-AM from its twin, KRTH-FM, both 
of which are owned by Beasley Broadcast Group of Naples, Fla. Liberman owns and 
operates KWIZ-AM and FM, which are based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley announced the sale Wednesday, when application was made to the Federal 
Communications Commission for a change in ownership. The deal should be 
completed by year-end. Beasley will continue to operate KRTH-FM. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan on going Spanish with the station," said Lenard Liberman, vice 
president of Liberman Broadcast Group. "This will bring to seven the number of 
Spanish-language stations in the area. It will be the most powerful in terms of 
signal strength."

'LEGENDS' CONCERTS TO SING PRAISES OF L.A. DOO-WOPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You want to know what's happening right now in music? Check out Los Angeles' 
inner-city high schools. That's where kids with musical dreams get together to 
work on their songs, maybe put something on tape and get it to a record 
producer. A few get to make records, and some of them have hits -- big hits 
with songs that are immediate and vital. 
</P>
<P>
That's how rap happens today, with names like Tone Loc and N.W.A capturing the 
moment of the black-teen mind-set. Thirty-five years ago, such L.A. groups as 
the Penguins, the Robins and the Meadowlarks served the same role. But the 
music wasn't rap. It was doo-wop. 
</P>
<P>
"You could actually start writing a song, call the record company while you 
were writing it, sing it to them on the phone, go over and record it before the 
week was out and the song could be on the radio within the next few hours," 
recalled Gaynell Hodge, who first sang on a hit record in 1952, while he was 
still a student at Jefferson High School. Among the hits Hodge either wrote, 
sang, played on or produced were "Earth Angel" (a Top 10 hit for the Penguins 
in 1954) and "Alley-Oop" (No. 1 for the Hollywood Argyles in 1960). 
</P>
<P>
"I remember wanting to take a girl to the prom, but being asked to record that 
night with the Hollywood Flames," Hodge recalled. "I ran by her house, gave her 
a corsage and then ran over in my tux to the studio and did the record. They 
promised that we'd be done by 9, but I was still there doing vocals till 11 or 
12. I think I ruined that girl's life." 
</P>
<P>
Hodge is one of four L.A. doo-wop figures who will perform in a tribute to the 
great L.A. vocal groups as part of the "Legends of Rock 'n' Roll" concerts 
tonight and Saturday at the Greek Theatre. The show's headliners include the 
Four Preps, Dick &amp; Dee Dee, Santo &amp; Johnny and Jimmie Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Hodge in the doo-wop segment will be Richard Berry (best known for 
writing "Louie Louie"), Don Julian (of the '50s Meadowlarks and later the 
Larks, who hit the Top 10 in 1964 with "The Jerk") and singer-writer Tony Allen 
("Night Owl" by the Chimes). 
</P>
<P>
Like rap today, doo-wop is generally associated with New York's street corners. 
But also like rap, the fact is that L.A. is equally productive in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A.'s always been a music center, but people bypass it when they speak of 
it," Hodge, 52, said from Phoenix, where he has lived since 1974. Today, he 
presents an oldies-but-goodies show six nights a week at a Scottsdale 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"I think L.A. had more record companies than any other city, and it still seems 
that way. A lot were underground and fly-by-night and when it came time to pay 
they would disappear. . . . Everybody was sweating it on a shoestring." 
</P>
<P>
Historians also tend to overlook the long-range impact that scene had on the 
evolution of L.A. pop -- and rock 'n' roll in general. Many of those who would 
go on to be part of Los Angeles' explosive rock scene of the '60s started out 
either participating in or inspired by '50s R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Alpert, who later co-founded A&amp;M Records, was a regular in the studios 
of the late '50s, and co-wrote Sam Cooke's hit "Wonderful World." Kim Fowley, 
an important behind-the-scenes figure through folk-rock and punk, was a part of 
the late '50s writing and studio scene, and co-wrote "Alley-Oop." Phil Spector, 
too, honed his skills there. 
</P>
<P>
Even eventual Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, who describes himself as the "most 
Republican white guy you ever talked to in rock 'n' roll," was determined as a 
teen to be part of the mostly black L.A. music world. 
</P>
<P>
That world, as described by Johnston, was a universe away from the good-times 
pop he became associated with when he joined the Beach Boys in the mid-'60s. At 
the time, Johnston was in a band that also included Spector and drummer Sandy 
Nelson, best known for his 1959 pre-surf instrumental "Teen Beat." 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy was poking around sessions and started bringing me," Johnston said. "And 
I was getting older and curious and went down to all these wonderful black 
clubs. I made a demo around then and we took it to (rock entrepreneur) John 
Dolphin's office. The door was locked and there was another guy waiting for 
Dolphin, and when we were let in, this guy pushed past us, got into an argument 
with Dolphin and pulled out a gun and killed him. That was my first day in 
recording." 
</P>
<P>
So even the violence sometimes associated with the world that produces rap 
today existed in the doo-wop world of the '50s. But one thing, Gaynell Hodge 
noted, is quite different: the money. Hodge estimated that he has made a total 
of no more than $70,000 for co-writing "Earth Angel." (It took a mid-'70s 
lawsuit to establish his rights to the song in the first place.) 
</P>
<P>
Said Hodge: "Today, they make that much in the first royalty check."

IVEY, MCGOVERN TO STAR IN SCR PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory has scored a casting coup, landing Dana Ivey and 
Elizabeth McGovern for the American premiere of "When I Was a Girl, I Used to 
Scream and Shout," to open on the Second Stage in November. 
</P>
<P>
In their SCR debuts, Ivey and McGovern will portray mother and daughter in 
Scottish playwright Sharman MacDonald's study of a relationship fraught with 
competition, love and jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey, who has received many Tony nominations, created the title role in Alfred 
Uhry's 1988 Pulitzer Prize-winning "Driving Miss Daisy." Among her Broadway 
credits are "Heartbreak House," "Present Laughter" and "Pack of Lies." 
</P>
<P>
McGovern, best known for her roles in such movies as "Ordinary People," 
"Ragtime" and the current "Johnny Handsome," has appeared on stage in New York 
and Los Angeles in such productions as Tina Howe's "Painting Churches," David 
Hare's "A Map of the World" and Wallace Shawn's "Aunt Dan and Lemon." 
</P>
<P>
Simon Stokes, who directed "When I Was a Girl" in its 1984 London premiere, 
also has cast Bruce Norris and Katherine Romaine in the four-character drama. 
Norris has appeared on Broadway in Neil Simon's "Biloxi Blues" and in various 
Off Broadway productions. Romaine's stage credits include appearances at New 
York's Apple Corps Theatre and Theatre Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The production will run Nov. 10 through Dec.10, with previews beginning Nov. 7.

WILL 'BATMAN' VIDEO ECLIPSE 'BAMBI' AND 'ROGER RABBIT'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warner's announcement of the November release of "Batman" on cassette has 
thrown a monkey wrench into the holiday home-video market. Some video companies 
will be hurt and the consumer will suffer to some extent. For video retailers, 
the presence of "Batman" will be a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Before the appearance of "Batman," Disney appeared to have cornered home 
video's holiday sales market. It released "Bambi" last week at a price of 
$26.99 and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" is due Thursday at $22.99. Disney has 
shipped nearly 10 million units of "Bambi" and will send out 7.9 million "Roger 
Rabbit" cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
But some industry observers have speculated that Disney will be hurt by 
"Batman" crashing the holiday party, the theory being that retailers will order 
"Batman" rather than reordering "Bambi" or "Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" will be released Nov. 15 at $24.95. It's the first blockbuster title 
to come to home video so soon after theatrical release -- just five months. 
Warner wanted to capitalize on Batmania. By releasing it now, industry experts 
say, Warner will sell perhaps 20% more cassettes than had it waited until 
Batmania had subsided. The company plans to ship between 10 million and 15 
million units. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cohen, senior vice president of Buena Vista Home Video, a subsidiary of 
the Walt Disney Co., doesn't think Disney will be hurt. "These movies have 
different audiences. Our product isn't in competition with 'Batman,' " he said. 
" 'Batman' will stimulate the market in general. It won't take away from our 
company's business." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a problem nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
With video retailers laying out a lot of money for copies of these three 
titles, they won't have as much to spend for other movies. That will impact on 
video companies -- who may not be able to sell as many of their films -- and 
the consumer, who will have a smaller selection from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
Though retailers may buy fewer rental copies of hits like RCA/Columbia's 
"Ghostbusters II" -- also due in mid-November -- companies that put out B and C 
titles probably will suffer most. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers will buy the hits but they'll pass on lesser known titles," 
predicted Barry Collier, whose company, Prism Entertainment, deals in B titles. 
"What we do is hold back a lot of our titles until December and January, so we 
won't get into head-on competition with the blockbuster titles." 
</P>
<P>
For video retailers, the best thing about "Batman" is that it will help bring 
in customers who may buy and rent other titles. "Titles like this generate 
excitement about home video," said Ron Castell, senior vice president of the 
Blockbuster retail chain. "There will be a lot more traffic in the video retail 
stores because of 'Batman' and the other blockbuster titles." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, much of the business that these titles will generate won't 
be at video stores. Buena Vista's Cohen estimates that 60% of the "Bambi" and 
"Roger Rabbit" shipments will go to mass merchants, such as K mart and Target, 
who've been making inroads in home-video sales market in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Mass merchants, which deal only in sales, covet inexpensive popular titles. 
They're not looking to make big profits; instead, they heavily discount these 
movies, often using them as loss leaders to attract customers who might buy 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, video retailers do count on big profits from these titles. The 
problem, though, is that mass merchants drive down the price with their 
discounts. To stay in competition, the video retailer has to lower his price 
too, sacrificing profit that many can't afford to sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"Warner Video will make a killing on 'Batman' but video retailers won't," said 
Mitch Perliss, director of purchasing for the Music Plus chain. "Not with these 
small profit margins. The way the business is structured now for the video 
retailer, there's just not a lot of money in these blockbuster titles."

WRITER AND STAR OF 'THE SCOUNDREL' IS HIMSELF A BEN JONSON FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Mortensen, the playwright, cast a pitying eye on Gregory Mortensen, the 
actor. He had just agreed to take over the lead in "The Scoundrel" -- his 
adaptation of Ben Jonson's "The Alchemist" -- with just seven days to rehearse 
for tonight's premiere at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that when I was writing the thing," he said, "I kept thinking, 
'Some poor bastard is going to have to memorize all these lines.' Well, now 
it's me, and it feels like I'm about to give birth." 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen, sitting in the theater's VIP room last week on the day of his first 
rehearsal, actually looked more comfortable than he felt. His big, athletic 
frame was folded neatly into a high-backed chair, and he spoke with brisk 
energy. If anything, he seemed eager "to get down to cases," wasting little 
real sympathy on himself and none at all on the New York actor he had been 
asked to replace because of a casting miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Scoundrel" is an updated burlesque of Jonson's 1610 satire on avarice, 
which revolved around a charlatan who dupes the gullible into believing that he 
has the power to transform other metals into gold. More to the point, he 
exploits their egregious cupidity with a practiced eye for overweening phonies. 
</P>
<P>
"What Jonson focused on, and what I've kept," Mortensen said, "is that greed is 
universal. It does not change. Only the names and the faces and the places 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Set in 1852 in San Francisco at the height of the Gold Rush, "The Scoundrel" 
centers on an itinerant theatrical troupe led by Dr. Aladice T. Smooth, who 
claims to have rediscovered the ancient alchemist's art. 
</P>
<P>
Smooth teams up to fleece the town with the unregenerate con artist Lucien 
Marmott and Cassie Spooner, a prostitute who owes as much to "Gunsmoke's" Miss 
Kitty as to "The Alchemist's" Doll Common. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jonson were to rise from the dead and sit in the house, he'd recognize a 
good 40% of the play," Mortensen said. "The doctor's hook, if you will, is 
this: Rather than risk life and limb in the dangerous gold camps of the upper 
Sierra, you can get rich right here." 
</P>
<P>
Because Jonson's Elizabethan caricatures of dupes and frauds do not travel 
easily across the centuries -- unlike Shakespeare's realistic characters -- 
Mortensen has transformed them into familiar types of the Reagan '80s: 
dishonest lawyers, dubious businessmen, unscrupulous evangelists, compulsive 
gamblers. All of them are skewered for various deadly sins, he said, "but the 
common denominator is greed." 
</P>
<P>
"There's also a lot of direct address to the house and a lot of asides," 
Mortensen added. "Jonson was a big fan of the aside, much more than 
Shakespeare. I want a light bulb to go on in people's heads. This is a play 
that may make people laugh. But afterward they may go, 'Hey, wait a minute. Was 
that addressed to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time somebody has rewritten Jonson. Larry Gelbart did it in 
1976 when he based "Sly Fox" -- a Broadway comedy that Mortensen saw and loved 
-- on the 1606 "Volpone." In fact, the actor-writer's adoration of anything 
Jonsonian makes him sound like a latter-day member of the "sons of Ben," a 
coterie of 17th-Century poets who lionized the self-made Elizabethan dramatist 
in his bibulous, old age. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a bricklayer's stepson who didn't want to be a bricklayer for the rest 
of his life, so he got himself educated," Mortensen said. "He decided to be a 
soldier of fortune. Went to the Netherlands. Fought the Spaniards. Said 'The 
hell with it.' Walked out on the battlefield in front of both armies waving a 
white rag. Said 'C'mon, I'll take on any one of you Spaniards.' Killed him. 
Stripped him of his armor. Said,' 'Bye, I'm leaving.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then he went back to England. Got his degree in letters. Set up a theater 
company. Killed one of his actors in a duel. An argument over a play. Was put 
on trial for murder and pleaded clemency by right of clergy. Said, 'I'm an 
educated man' and got off. He was his own attorney. All they did was brand him 
on his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was the John Huston of his day. A real roustabout bohemian." 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen's background also has a certain flair. Raised in Los Gatos near San 
Jose, he is a fourth-generation Californian whose father "rode with the Hells 
Angels as an undercover narcotics detective" and made sure to send him to a 
school run by Jesuit priests. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't last," recalled Mortensen, 34. "They said question everything, but 
just don't question us. So one day they asked us to write about absolutes. I 
wrote that the only absolutes were Zen and physics. That got their attention. 
They eventually gave me the option to leave, which I took." 
</P>
<P>
After high school, where he was "a drama jock," he went to San Jose State 
University, joined the California Actors Theater as an apprentice and appeared 
in some Shakespeare at Berkeley Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"What I found out were my professional limitations," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He auditioned for the Juilliard School Drama Division in New York, which 
accepted him in a two-year advanced program "to my surprise." Then he put in 
stints on and off Broadway, followed in 1983 by a year as a contract player at 
the Denver Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen, who is married to a casting director, now makes his base in 
Hollywood, where he has landed a steady flow of guest shots on TV shows such as 
"Remington Steele," "The Deliberate Stranger" (the miniseries about killer Ted 
Bundy), "General Hospital" (the soap), the upcoming series "Hard Time on Planet 
Earth" and a movie role in "Hollywood Chaos" (out about Christmas). 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Mortensen has also become a regular at the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, playing Prince Hal in "Henry IV (Part I)," Marc Antony in "Julius 
Caesar," Bolingbroke in "Richard II" and Edgar in "King Lear." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he has kept up a writing career. His first play -- "How It All 
Began" -- was written with Des McAnuff, artistic director of the La Jolla 
Playhouse, about the German Baader/Meinhoff terrorists of the '70s. Joseph Papp 
produced it in 1981 at the Public Theater in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen is collaborating with New Yorker Byam Stevens on "A Nation's Trial," 
a Civil War trilogy based on a trove of daguerreotype photos taken at the 
Battle of Antietam. The middle segment, entitled "Hold Outs," was staged in 
1987 at the Company of Angeles one-act play festival. They also have two 
screenplays in the works: "Seeing Red," about espionage in Silicon Valley, and 
an untitled project about outlaw John Wesley Harding. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mortensen would drop everything "to do what I really want if I had the 
money," he said, "and that is to set up a nice troupe of actors in, say, 
Capitola or Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
"I equate a lot of what goes on in 'The Scoundrel' with what goes on in Los 
Angeles," he added. "Everybody is hoping to hit that vein and strike it rich. 
But so much of this business is baloney. 
</P>
<P>
"The best piece of advice I ever got came from an old actor who told me, 
'Listen, kid, if you ever become a star, just remember one thing: A star is 
nothing but a burning ball of gas.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jonson, he noted, would have agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grove Shakespeare Festival presents "The Scoundrel" by Gregory Mortensen 
through Nov. 4 at the Gem Theatre, 12852 Main St., Garden Grove. Curtain: 8 
p.m. today and Saturday; 3 p.m. Sunday; 8 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday. Tickets:

'UPBEAT LIVE' GETS THE MESSAGE OUT TO CLASSICAL MUSIC LISTENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helping the layman appreciate classical music is a favorite undertaking for 
many writers, scholars and pundits dedicated to the world of music. Such 
experts are often convincing, persuasive and charismatic. But they also need to 
know how to tell a good joke. 
</P>
<P>
For many Southland listeners, from dabblers to the more dedicated, the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic offers a series of free, hourlong, pre-concert lectures 
called "Upbeat Live." The presentations, given an hour before every 
subscription concert, introduce the current program and offer insights from 
local music personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Most important, we try to get the audience to trust their own ears," says Ara 
Guzelimian, artistic administrator for the Philharmonic and coordinator of 
"Upbeat Live" since its inception in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the notion of thinking of classical music as a sacred priesthood. There 
is no right reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to give them information that will help them, but we stress that if you 
don't like a piece, don't think that it's like oatmeal and you have to eat it. 
That really destroys the experience." 
</P>
<P>
The series opened last night with Alan Chapman, a music theorist who teaches at 
Occidental College and has given several "Upbeat Live" presentations. His 
discussion on the background and other aspects of the program this weekend, the 
fourth symphonies of Shostakovich and Beethoven, will also be given tonight, 
Saturday night and Sunday afternon. 
</P>
<P>
"In trying to supply the key to get inside a piece I usually discover something 
new about the piece myself," Chapman says. "It's not like presenting a paper at 
a theory convention. Pacing is important because it's part performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the most important thing is the tie you wear. For me, it's the only 
opportunity I have to indulge in both music history and stand-up comedy at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that speakers are informed, but also relaxed," says Guzelimian. 
"It shouldn't be like an evening of taking information off of stone tablets 
from the mountaintops. There should also be a little entertainment in the 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
For the broad cross-section of listeners who attend the Philharmonic's 
concerts, "Upbeat Live" is an opportunity to relax after the often-hectic 
ritual of driving on the freeways, finding a parking place and so on. 
Subscribers have been known to come from as far away as Bakersfield and the 
pre-concert presentations give them a chance to pause and tune in to the music 
they are about to hear. 
</P>
<P>
One subscriber, Karen Wilson, 34, drives all the way from Hemet to hear the 
Philharmonic perform and claims that she never misses an "Upbeat Live" lecture. 
She works as a chemist for a large company there and paints portraits in her 
spare time. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually get some tidbit or helpful hint out of the lecture. If anything, it 
lets me know when to clap," says Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I'm crazy for driving 90 minutes every week just to hear a concert. 
For me, it's always a wonderful chance to get away from Hemet for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson recalls other lectures by Chapman and how he would compare the music to 
situations in every-day life. She especially remembers how he used the 
comparison of an L.A. freeway to a Beethoven symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman says: "It's comparable to attempting to do several things at once. The 
transitions within a symphonic work are a lot like freeway ramps. On another 
occasion, I tried to compare a Bruckner symphony with a football game.

Saturday is Family Day at Newport Harbor Art Museum and Newport Beach Public 
Library, with a series of free activities from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. for children 
and their parents. There will be performances by the Opera Pacific Overture 
Company ("America Sings and Works"); Daion Taiko, a Japanese percussion 
ensemble; and Steve Mellow's Children's Readers' Theatre Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities will include face painting, supervised games inside a fanciful 
inflatable sculpture, cartooning workshop demonstrations and spin art -- in 
which a revolving turntable transforms squirts of paint into abstract art. 
Mimes will perform throughout the day. The museum also will be showing art by 
children in kindergarten through sixth grade from the Newport-Mesa and Irvine 
unified school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Newport Beach Salute to the Arts, Family Day is sponsored by the City 
of Newport Beach Arts Commission. The library and museum are in Newport Center, 
at 850 and 856 San Clemente Drive. For more information, call the museum's

LIFE ON THE CIRCUIT: RUSHIN' IN, OUT AT RECEPTION FOR SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Scene 
</P>
<P>
Post-concert hob-nob in the Center Club following Tuesday's performance by the 
Moscow Virtuosi at the Performing Arts Center. Members of the Soviet chamber 
orchestra -- whose classical selections inaugurated the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society's 36th season -- mingled with 100 or so OCPS subscribers. 
Briefly. Call it school-night syndrome: The well-heeled locals arrived just 
before 10 p.m., and all but a few were gone an hour later. After changing from 
their tuxes, the Soviets arrived late and stayed later -- until finally (not 
even midnight yet!) the only signs of life in that paneled corner of the plush 
club were a dozen Russians seated at two candle-lit tables, smoking, drinking, 
talking among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the translation. "The concert was incredible, but I didn't understand 
what the conductor was saying before the encores," said Margaret Martin, who 
attended the performance and party with Melissa Brandl. After a few strained 
exchanges with one of the Muscovites, Pat Krone shook her head and went back to 
her champagne. "I asked him why they didn't have any women in the group," said 
Krone. "I'm a product of the women's movement and that's the first thing I saw 
when they came out on stage -- all men. Why don't they have any women 
musicians? He said they can't because they travel so much." Krone laughed. "I 
wanted to tell him women know how to pack, too." Off in a corner, business 
partners Daniel Ibarra and Mario Schelfi discussed the Virtuosi's virtuosity. 
"More perfect," said Schelfi. "Exactly," agreed Ibarra. "For me," said Schelfi, 
"the American sound is more commercial and (the Moscow Virtuosi) are less, how 
do you say this?" Schelfi turned to Ibarra, who translated a few words about 
the Soviets from Argentine Spanish into English. "They are the least 
re-touched," said Ibarra, taking a bite of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The Food 
</P>
<P>
Three buffets. The first (tucked in a corner by the grand piano) held cheeses 
and fruit -- raspberries and strawberries and grapes spilling down piles of 
purple kale. The second (deeper in the dark room) was loaded with chicken and 
cheese enchiladas. Third and most dangerous (against the far wall, under oil 
paintings of sun on the water or fire and clouds -- who can tell?) offered a 
silver tureen of creamy chocolate fondue and hunks of fruit. Servers skimmed 
through the crowd bearing trays of champagne and Chardonnay. What, no wodka? 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
ErichVollmer, executive director of OCPS, who noted the Virtuosi's popularity 
here (this was their second visit and the season-opener, no less). "They play 
as if there were only three people up there (on stage)," said Vollmer, plucking 
a glass of bubbly water from a passing tray. "It's rare to hear such unanimity 
of artistic purpose." Conductor and soloist Vladimir Spivakov, who was much in 
demand for party talk (and led briskly around the room, from one tony couple to 
another). Edra Brophy of Palm Desert, who sat with son William Gillespie and 
their guests, Richard and Frances Gadbois III. (This series of concerts is 
dedicated to Brophy, who put $1.2 million in a charitable trust with OCPS as 
beneficiary.) Fred and Eva Schneider, party chairwoman. Marianne and Gary 
Hollander. Elaine and Bill Redfield. Joann and Ed Halvajian, OCPS president. 
The Halvajians tete-a-teted with Spivakov about relief efforts in the Soviet 
region of Armenia, which was devastated by an earthquake last December. (Ed 
Halvajian and Spivakov are both Armenian and had heard through the grapevine 
about each other's participation in Armenian relief, Halvajian said.) 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: 
</P>

"One of them said they were getting on an Aeroflot plane for Moscow tomorrow, 
and another one said they were going to Pasadena. What did you hear?" PAMELA

IB PROGRAM ASKS A LOT -- AND STUDENTS DELIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Homework versus sports practice. Research papers versus a part-time job. 
Studying for exams versus a good night's sleep. International Baccalaureate 
versus a "normal" curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
For 300 Sunny Hills High School students, the choice was for homework, research 
papers and studying -- all major components of the International Baccalaureate 
program, a comprehensive and rigorous four-year honors program offered at the 
Fullerton school. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for a diploma in the IB program must demonstrate mastery of six 
subject areas, write a 5,000-word essay, volunteer 100 hours in their 
communities and enroll in a "Theory of Knowledge" course in addition to their 
normal high school classes and duties. 
</P>
<P>
The choice to tackle the IB program can be a difficult one. 
</P>
<P>
Atul Saran, a senior enrolled in IB, said students shouldn't get involved with 
the program just "because you've always been in honors classes, or your parents 
are pushing you, or because all of your friends are. You need to do it because 
you will enjoy the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
And a challenge it most certainly is. A senior's typical IB schedule will 
include a double-period advanced biology class, a course in advanced philosophy 
known as "Theory of Knowledge" and four or five additional honors courses. 
</P>
<P>
Many IB students find themselves at school for eight hours a day and then face 
an additional four to five hours of homework each night. 
</P>
<P>
An international program based in Geneva, Switzerland, IB includes 400 schools 
in 55 countries, with about 20 California schools participating. Locally, 
Canyon, Fullerton, Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo, Sonora, Troy and Sunny Hills 
high schools offer IB as an option. 
</P>
<P>
Although the screening process for candidates varies from school to school, the 
curriculum is international. 
</P>
<P>
The IB program satisfies "the need for more international awareness," said Ron 
Woerner, IB coordinator at Sunny Hills. "It insists on fluency in two 
languages, emphasizes the study of world literature and a knowledge of other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a relatively new program -- established 20 years ago in Europe 
and brought to California about "eight or nine years ago," Woerner said -- 
there is some controversy over its use as a tool for helping students gain 
admission to college. 
</P>
<P>
"The IB program is no guarantee of college admittance, but it can be an 
advantage," Woerner said. "The curriculum itself is very valuable." The program 
teaches time management and study skills vital to a successful college career, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
IB differs from Advanced Placement classes by providing a "complete program," 
Woerner said. "IB forces a student to test in all areas and has elements, such 
as the community service requirement, which are outside of the classroom. AP is 
not a program, it's a series of individual classes." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the workload, students enjoy the program for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to take the most challenging classes possible," Saran said. "School is 
boring unless you can feel the satisfaction of tackling the toughest the school 
has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills senior Paul Park, an IB diploma candidate, added: "I've been in the 
program for three years and made the commitment. As I see it, I might as well 
go through with it. Plus, it is kind of like a privilege." 
</P>
<P>
Some students, however, don't see IB as worth their time or effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The time I spent on IB could have been more useful doing other stuff, such as 
working at the boys' club, (playing) varsity basketball and volunteering at the 
animal hospital," said Chat Chuenrudeemol, a senior who chose to drop out of 
the IB program. 
</P>
<P>
And Chuenrudeemol is not alone. Within the first two weeks of the beginning of 
school, a number of students, including 15 of 55 seniors, dropped out of the 
Sunny Hills IB program. Although some dropped due to poor grades, the majority 
did so for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Harini Krishnan, who chose not to continue, said she can take on a 
challenging curriculum, one that reflects her personal interests, without the 
additional pressures of IB. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still taking all hard classes," she said, "but instead of taking AP/IB 
Biology, I'm taking AP French Literature." 
</P>
<P>
Such complaints have not stopped nearly 90 freshmen and sophomores from signing 
up for the honors classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The IB program makes our school special," said Louie Cheng, a sophomore who 
said his parents encouraged him to join. "It will look good for college." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Terry Mann, who said he joined IB because most of his friends are 
involved, said, "I qualified for it, so I decided to try it." 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the program, students must pass language usage, writing sample 
and algebra tests. Also, their junior high grade-point average, rank on 
national exams and teacher comments are also considered. 
</P>
<P>
Woerner said he was surprised at the decision of some of the seniors to drop 
IB. "I don't resent them dropping the program," he emphasized, "but when a 
student sits in my office and cries, it may not be in their best interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the students are going to wind up in two or three months really 
feeling sorry," he said. "I have some concern that students may be making their 
decision on shaky sources of information. Often students who have graduated and 
not been successful in the program will portray it in a negative light." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Woerner said, if students don't know whom to contact at a given college, 
they may falsely conclude that the college does not recognize the IB program. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the experiences and attitudes Woerner has recently encountered as 
students dropped out of IB, he said he has re-evaluated his philosophy toward 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
When he began implementing IB four years ago, he said he thought "the ultimate 
goal in the IB program was to earn the diploma. This is what I stressed and 
what I sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the No. 1 value of being in the IB program is doing the IB program."

'SWEET 16' POEM BY IRVINE JUNIOR NAMED A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jill Lytle, a junior at University High School in Irvine, was a winner in the 
"Sweet 16 Contest" sponsored by Sassy magazine and the Diamond Information 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Her essay on why it's "cool" to be 16 and those of 15 other contestants were 
deemed the most creative and original by a panel of judges, which included 
young celebrities Lonnie Quinn from the soap opera "All My Children" and Sean 
Kanan of "Karate Kid III." Sassy magazine's Editor in Chief Jane Pratt and 
entertainment editor Christina Kelly also judged the contest, which received 
submissions from more than 500 girls, all age 16. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 winners and their mothers won a weekend trip in September to New York 
City, where the girls were presented three-quarter-carat diamond pendants 
during a party at the St. Moritz Hotel in Manhattan. The winners were also 
treated to a makeover at Bloomingdale's department store and lunch at the Hard 
Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, in a majority of the essays, boys were the most popular 
subject, along with dating and getting a driver's license. For many young 
women, gaining independence and a sense of responsibility were the focus, and a 
number of them expressed social concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's teens are definitely more sophisticated and worldly than their 
parents' generation," Pratt said. "They are exposed to so much through 
television and other media, and are very aware of world events. We know from 
talking to our readers that they are concerned with everything from 
environmental issues to maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Lytle's 14-line poem explores the contrasting feelings a girl of 16 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 You're not an adult, 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are you a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that middleness, 
</P>
<P>
 You're allowed to go wild. 
</P>
<P>
 You're independent 
</P>
<P>
 (To a certain extent). 
</P>
<P>
 While you're still dependent, 
</P>
<P>
 (You don't pay rent). 
</P>
<P>
 You can act mature, 
</P>
<P>
 Or immature, 
</P>
<P>
 Or anywhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what's so great 
</P>
<P>
 About being Sweet 16!!

HOT TOPICS: DO YOU FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody, at one time or another, feels misunderstood. Maybe you've done 
something -- without even knowing it -- that's brought about the silent 
treatment from your best friend. Maybe you have an undeserved reputation at 
school. Or maybe your parents have grounded you, and you're not exactly sure 
why. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topics wonders: "What is the one thing you feel you are most misunderstood 
about?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am most misunderstood about my life style. Because of the friends I hang 
around, most people often think I am loud and even arrogant. I enjoy being with 
my friends, but more than that, I enjoy my quiet times."

"The image I present at school, because during the last five years or so, I

in and my 'party' years will be mostly a memory." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cornwell, 18, 
</P>
<P>
senior, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't seem to understand my intentions. Different people have 
different personalities, and therefore need more or less of my time. Some 
people handle compliments better than others; therefore, they receive more or 
less and the appearance is sometimes misleading. I wish everyone would know I 
really do care about them equally, and sometimes my distribution of myself 
isn't always as fair as I would like it to be."

Homicide detectives are investigating the death of an unidentified man whose 
body was found in the desert near Palmdale, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The man appeared to have been shot to death, Deputy Hal Grant said. The body 
was found about 6 p.m. Thursday by someone who was driving a four-wheel-drive 
vehicle in a remote desert area about two miles southwest of Avenue S and Tovey 
Avenue, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim appeared to have been about 40 years old, Grant said. The body may 
have been dumped there, he said, but investigators did not disclose an estimate 
of how long the man had been dead.

The judge in the marathon McMartin preschool molestation trial today decided 
not to sequester the jury during deliberations which he believes could take as 
long as two months. 
</P>
<P>
"He feels that it would be too much of a hardship on the jurors," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, who participated in discussions with Superior Court 
Judge William R. Pounders about sequestering the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders had considered housing the jurors at a hotel while they pondered their 
decision in the 2 1/2-year-old trial.

ADMINISTRATION FIRES BACK AT CRITICISM OF FAILED COUP;

The Bush Administration today launched a vigorous defense of its handling of 
the failed coup in Panama, saying it would not have done anything differently 
and that "we did the best we could with the information available." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Administration officials said the United States was guilty of 
shortcomings in intelligence matters and other areas. "I hope we will have 
learned some things from this and be a little better next time," said one 
senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, the White House said President Bush was satisfied with the U.S. role 
but disappointed that rebels had failed to depose Panamanian ruler Manuel 
Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Not Regretted 
</P>
<P>
Bush said today that he does not regret his decision against intervening 
militarily, adding, "There was never a chance to have (Noriega) handed over to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
"We reviewed all the information, and I don't see anything now that would have 
made me make a different decision then," Bush told reporters as he emerged from 
Walter Reed Army Medical Center after minor surgery on his finger. 
</P>
<P>
As the Administration mounted its defense, the nation's top military leaders 
went before Senate committees investigating the Administration's actions, 
including whether rebel troops sought U.S. support while the uprising was in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence and Armed Services committees met in closed session with 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to press for the details. 
</P>
<P>
After the three-hour session, Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) quoted Cheney and 
Powell as saying they "basically . . . would not have changed their decision 
and recommendations to the President, based on what they know today." 
</P>
<P>
The two panels planned to issue later today an analysis of issues that remain 
in dispute surrounding the events in Panama and contacts between the rebel 
officers who organized the coup and U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things in dispute" said Armed Services Committee Chairman 
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), referring to media and other accounts that he said are "all 
over the lot." He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Best We Could' 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush "feels that we 
did the best we could with the information available and he feels he made the 
right decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, after meeting with Republican senators at the Capitol earlier today, 
denied that there was a lack of communications during the coup attempt. He 
added that senators "don't feel that way either." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Administration publicly pinpointed the wife of coup 
leader Maj. Moises Giroldi as the person who tipped off U.S. officials about 
the planned coup. She contacted U.S. officials last Sunday, Fitzwater said, 
disputing a Wall Street Journal report that she had made contact three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Adella Bonilla de Giroldi on Sunday night arranged for a 
meeting between her husband and two officials from the CIA. It said the CIA had 
confidence in the rebels but the U.S. military did not.

A routine traffic stop led to two arrests in connection with the slaying of a 
19-year-old man who had accompanied two men on a test drive in North Hollywood 
of his 1973 Datsun 240Z, which he had been trying to sell, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested late Thursday in West Los Angeles after officers pulled 
one of them over, said police Lt. Ron LaRue. Officers then discovered its 
license plates had been switched, LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
"The vehicle was in fact taken during the murder-robbery of Richard Davis," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
LaRue said officers arrested Kent Derek Parrish, 21, and later took into 
custody Ronald Lewis Fort, 20. Both were being held without bail. A handgun 
believed used in the murder was also recovered.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged East Germans today to be patient 
for change as he helped observe 40 years of a Communist system that tens of 
thousands of East Germans have recently rejected by fleeing West. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin chief said he has "complete confidence" in East Germany's ability 
to solve its growing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Communist authorities closed three major border crossings between East and West 
Berlin, and church sources said riot police with clubs, tear gas and water 
cannons patrolled the streets of major cities throughout East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The sources also reported new clashes between police and protesters, and West 
German television showed battles in Dresden between police and protesters 
hoping to join the exodus of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"Be patient, don't panic and don't be sad. We are very close partners and we 
will solve our problems and struggles together," Gorbachev told 1,000 East 
Germans at a monument for the victims of fascism. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorby! Gorby!" East Germans shouted as Gorbachev arrived from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the situation in East Germany was dangerous, he said: "I 
don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to our problems, there is no comparison," he said with a chuckle. 
"Nothing surprises us anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"We have complete confidence in" East Germany's ability to solve its problems, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev joined other East Bloc leaders for a two-day show of unity, despite 
fractured relations over the refugee flight and East Germany's reluctance to 
try the type of political reforms he has championed. 
</P>
<P>
East German leader Erich Honecker welcomed Gorbachev at East Berlin's 
Schoenefeld Airport, the state news agency ADN said. Gorbachev later planned to 
address Communist Party dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, a train brought 633 East German refugees from Poland to West 
Germany, the latest of more than 47,000 citizens who have fled this tightly 
controlled society to the West since mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
There were efforts to avoid further embarrassment to the East Berlin 
government. Authorities closed three of the nine busiest border crossings into 
the city, turning back hundreds of tourists and West Germans since Thursday, 
said Werner Thronicker, a spokesman for the West Berlin government. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin, the site of anniversary events, was bedecked with the fixtures of 
socialist celebration. Huge red banners were draped from the Communist Party 
headquarters, reviewing stands were set for parades and flags hung from public 
buildings and apartment blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Kiosks were plastered with posters showing construction workers and young 
mothers appreciating accomplishments of the postwar republic, founded on Oct. 
7, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
But the image of the East Germans who fled to the West through Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary and Poland was broadcast nationwide by West German television. 
</P>
<P>
The West German government said it saw "no reason for celebration" since the 
date marks four decades of the division of the German nation.

MILLIONS LOST IN ERRORS ON RENT, HUD AUDIT SAYS

<P>
Errors in calculating rents for subsidized housing are costing the federal 
government millions of dollars a year, according to a Department of Housing and 
Urban Development internal audit obtained today. 
</P>
<P>
A second audit, sent to Congress this week, raises fresh charges of favoritism 
in the awarding of rent subsidies and says such conduct was allowed because of 
poor program accountability. Mismanagement and political favoritism are the key 
subjects of congressional investigations of HUD during the Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
For the rent study, completed last week and released under the Freedom of 
Information Act, HUD's inspector general reviewed 142 of the 2,755 areas for 
which the department sets fair-market rents for subsidized housing. He found 
that in 116 of those areas, the government was paying as much as $39.1 million 
a year in excessive subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Since the review covered only 5% of the rent areas and that sample was not 
drawn at random, the auditors said they could not provide a nationwide estimate 
of likely overpayments but noted that HUD's long-range commitments to the 
Section 8 program are in the area of $188 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they recommended that HUD take a number of steps to bring its Section 8 
rent formulas in line with local real estate market conditions, particularly in 
rural areas not covered by government or industry housing surveys. In a 
smattering of areas, the auditors said HUD might also be paying too little in 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The report was sharply criticized by HUD officials in charge of the program, 
who responded to a draft copy in July by saying "the evidence simply does not 
support a conclusion of any serious problem."

last great balloon crossing -- a nonstop voyage across the Pacific Ocean in the 
biggest hot-air balloon ever built. 
</P>
<P>
Branson, whose attempt to fly a balloon across the Atlantic in 1987 ended when 
he was forced to ditch in the Irish Sea, said the 6,200-mile crossing is 
ballooning's last great challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The only place left to have a go at is the Pacific. It is double the length of 
the Atlantic and, in ballooning terms, it is the last great challenge," he told 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Branson's balloon, Pacific Flier, is 200 feet tall and has been under 
construction in secret for the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
It will take off from southern Japan about Nov. 15 and ride 210-m.p.h. winds at 
an altitude of about 33,000 feet. It is expected to land on the West Coast of 
the United States four or five days later.

Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said today that he hopes federal disaster officials 
react faster to the next national disaster than they did in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he met with top Federal Emergency Management Agency officials and 
found them sincere, but called the disaster relief law "grossly inadequate" and 
the response to the emergency too slow. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope next time a national disaster hits this country, the government will 
have a better response," Riley said. "I would be shirking my responsiblity and 
be less honest if I didn't say what I felt." 
</P>
<P>
"When the rubble is clear, we will work with Congress for a better law and a 
better response," the mayor said.

Jim Bakker climbed into his sky blue Ford sedan today and headed back to 
Florida to close down his television ministry and get ready for what could be a 
lifetime partnership in a federal penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker, 49, was convicted Thursday of 24 counts of criminal fraud and 
conspiracy in the sale of so-called lifetime partnerships at PTL. He faces up 
to 120 years in prison when he is sentenced Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, had said Thursday that the television ministry would 
continue but defense attorney George Davis said the couple decided to close 
down their daily "Jim and Tammy Show" to concentrate on an appeal.

Japan's Sony Corp. has donated $3 million, its largest single gift to date to a 
U.S. college, to endow a research and teaching position in electrical and 
computer engineering at the University of Illinois, the school announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The chair to be funded by the grant will be named in honor of John Bardeen, 81, 
a university faculty member who won the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics as 
co-inventor of the transistor. Bardeen also won a Nobel in 1972 for 
co-development of the theory of superconductivity at low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
One of Sony's earliest products was a radio using the transistor developed by 
Bardeen and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
The university revealed the gift at opening ceremonies for its $13.5-million 
microelectronics laboratory.

One of the country's largest advertising agencies was indicted today on charges 
it paid nearly $1 million in bribes to obtain the Jamaican Tourist Board's ad 
account in 1981, a federal prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury this morning returned the 43-page indictment against Young &amp; 
Rubicam, three of its current or former executives and two former Jamaican 
officials, said U.S. Atty. Stanley A. Twardy. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury has been investigating the relationship between the agency and 
the Caribbean nation's tourism authority since 1986, Twardy said. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based agency, which developed the "Come back to Jamaica" ad 
campaign, denied any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked and dismayed by this move. We believe these allegations are 
based on speculation and innuendo and are without substance or merit," Young 
&amp; Rubicam said in a 2 1/2-page statement today.

Ford Motor Co. has received U.S. regulatory clearance to buy up to 15% of 
Jaguar PLC, a spokesman for Ford's British unit said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ford received early clearance by the Federal Trade Commission, which must 
approve major share acquisitions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, said the Ford 
United Kingdom spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar shares closed $1 higher at $11.77 on London's Stock Exchange. Volume was 
a heavy 13 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Ford had purchased any Jaguar shares 
today. It previously owned about 1% of the British luxury auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar's rules of association prohibit any shareholder from taking more than a 
15% stake before the end of 1990 and give the British government a "golden" 
share with which it may block any bid for the formerly state-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar has characterized Ford's stake-buying as unwelcome and says it wants to 
remain independent.

Boeing Co. apologized to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney for any delays stemming 
from the strike by 57,800 machinists, and supervisors worked to complete 
jetliners nearly ready for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Striking machinists, the biggest group of production workers at the world's 
largest aerospace company, continued on the picket lines to press their claim 
for a larger share of the company's profits. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just like to see things a little more fair," Fred Mayo, a mechanic at 
Boeing's Everett plant, said Thursday night on the picket line. "The company 
did have a record year last year." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet builder with 65% of the Free World's 
market, is in its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders with a 
backlog worth $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Frank A. Shrontz sent Cheney a telegram Thursday apologizing for any 
delays in delivery because of the strike and assuring that Boeing "will do all 
it can to resolve this issue at the earliest possible time." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing receives billions of dollars of defense contracts a year that range from 
work on the B-2 Stealth bomber to guided missile systems and avionic research. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the strike will be short-lived," the telegram said. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Jack Gamble said about 40 planes are in the final assembly or 
test stages that probably could be completed during the strike. Before the 
strike, Boeing was producing about 30 planes a month. 
</P>
<P>
The strike went into its third day today with no new negotiations scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said company officials met Wednesday to discuss 
the strike but he knew of no further meetings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is mute," said union spokesman Jack Daniels. "They're doing their 
aristocratic aloof act."

Something's got to give. 
</P>
<P>
After a split of the first two games of the best-of-7 National League playoffs, 
the scene shifts Saturday night to San Francisco, where the Giants had the best 
home record in the league at 53-28. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chicago Cubs' 45-36 road mark also was the best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're going to San Francisco thinking we can't win out there," 
Cubs Manager Don Zimmer said after Chicago's 9-5 victory Thursday night. That 
followed an 11-3 loss in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we got beat up pretty good," Zimmer said of the opener. "It 
seemed like we weren't supposed to be on the same field with them. But we 
always come back. Now here we are, after 14 games, 7-7." 
</P>
<P>
The two teams also split their 12 regular-season games, with each team 3-3 on 
its home field. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the series has featured the two first-basemen, Mark Grace of the Cubs 
and the Giants' Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Grace has had six hits with six RBIs. Clark was the force in the opener with 
six RBIs and four hits, two of them home runs including a grand slam, and drove 
in six runs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Cubs didn't retire Clark until the fifth inning of the second game 
when, with two on and two outs, Zimmer yanked Bielecki for left-hander Paul 
Assenmacher, who got Clark to bounce out on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer faced a similar situation in the opener when he allowed starter Greg 
Maddux to pitch to Clark, who hit his grand slam for an 8-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come into the playoffs thinking about competing with Will Clark," 
Grace said. "I'd be crazy, an idiot, to try to outdo Will Clark. He was right 
there for the batting title (.333) and drove in 115 runs." 
</P>
<P>
Grace, who said, "I'm here to face the Giants and try to help the Cubs win," 
didn't have bad figures either. He batted .314 with 79 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good young hitter," Clark said. "He's taking advantage of all the 
situations. As a hitter, you have to tip your hat to him because he does the 
job. Some way or another, we're going to have to figure a way to get him out." 
</P>
<P>
It will be up to Rick Sutcliffe of the Cubs and Mike LaCoss of the Giants to do 
something about Clark and Grace Saturday night when the series continues. 
</P>
<P>
"They are two veterans with good stomachs," Craig said of the pitching 
match-up. "They pitch well in pressure situations."

Houston Astros catcher Craig Biggio today was placed on two years probation, 
fined $350 and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service after he was 
convicted of driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
County Court-at-Law Judge Jim Barkley, who delivered the verdict Thursday, said 
failure to live up to the terms of the probation would get Biggio 180 days in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Biggio was arrested June 8 several hours after the Astros defeated the San 
Diego Padres as he drove Astros third baseman Ken Caminiti home after the two 
had visited several bars. 
</P>
<P>
An Intoxilyzer test given Biggio by Houston police an hour after his arrest had 
a reading of 0.13. Under Texas law, a person whose test shows 0.10 is regarded 
as intoxicated.

Young Mother, a 3-year-old French filly, and the Aga Khan's Aliysa are 
favorites in an unspectacular field for Sunday's 68th running of the 
$1.3-million Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen horses are entered in the turf race at a distance of a little more 
than 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of Nashwan, until recently hailed as one of Europe's best 
racehorses of the last decade, has thrown the field open. The British colt was 
unbeaten in six races, including the Epsom Derby, but then fared miserably in 
the Prix Niel here last month, finishing third behind Golden Pheasant and 
French Glory. 
</P>
<P>
Young Mother, trained by Frenchman Jean-Marie Beguingne and with Alain Badel 
aboard, had a convincing win in the recent Prix Vermeille. Aliysa, ridden by 
Walter Swinburn, has not competed since July but is highly thought of, as is 
Cacoethes, second to Nashwan at Ascot and in the King George.

Football already has an enthusiastic following in Britain. National Football 
League games are aired on British television each week and draw large
