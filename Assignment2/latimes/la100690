BAD THINGS BREWING AT RAIDER GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a popular bumper sticker that reads: "Instant Jerk, Just Add Alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
I feel this bumper sticker explains the problems rowdy Raider fans are causing. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol has a tendency to make people uninhibited. When you put this 
uninhibitedness together with the change that occurs in a large crowd, you are 
going to have problems. 
</P>
<P>
Solution? First, try ending alcohol sales at the end of the first half. If that 
doesn't work, cut off all sales of alcohol at the Coliseum completely. There 
also has to be more of an effort to stop the tailgate parties that dominate the 
area around the Coliseum before Raider games. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps sober fans would be better-behaved fans.

Is it only anti-Raider fans who write to the L.A. Times or does The Times 
choose to print only letters from such morons? People in L.A., wake up! Just 
try openly flaunting your support of an opposing team in New York, Chicago, 
Pittsburgh or any other NFL city (except maybe Anaheim) and security will 
remove you quicker than a breakaway run by Bo Jackson.

RAMS' BRASS NEEDS A NEW BATTLE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way I see it, when the general isn't too smart, the army isn't going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson used Curt Warner for more than two quarters and thoroughly messed 
up the whole Ram offense. General John should have realized that Curt no longer 
had the magic touch, nor is he likely to regain it in the future. If Robinson 
ever realizes that Cleveland Gary is the man of the future, then we might start 
winning the war again.

SCHOOLS NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH DYSLEXICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent estimates indicate that between 10% to 15% of school-age children have 
some sort of learning disability. 
</P>
<P>
And 75% of juvenile delinquents have a reading disability. Dyslexia does not 
discriminate. Rich, poor, high-I.Q., gifted athletes and nice kids can be 
afflicted with this learning inconvenience, as I term it. Learning disabled 
means unable. Dyslexics are able, they just learn differently. 
</P>
<P>
Russell White (Sept. 26) is yet another product of a school system that is 
inept, poorly funded, overpopulated and poorly staffed to deal with the 
Specific Language Disability (dyslexic) student.

FRANKLIN STRUGGLES, BEATS MARSHALL, 10-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, a game against Marshall High meant an easy victory for the 
Franklin football team. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, the defending City Division 3-A champion, struggled to beat Marshall, 
10-7, Friday in a Northern Conference opener at Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Under former Coach Armando Gonzalez, Franklin (2-2) won three City 
championships in the last four years while compiling a 44-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset at the way we played today," said Coach Ed Elias, a former Alhambra 
assistant who replaced Gonzalez this year. "We played a terrible second half 
and lost our intensity. This is a young team, and we're making young mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been frustrating this season because we've had so many injuries and 
academic ineligibilities. We're playing with a completely makeshift defense." 
</P>
<P>
One key player missing was returning All-City linebacker Julius Rice, who is 
academically ineligible and watched from the sidelines Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Elias seemed most concerned with the defense, the offense struggled 
against Marshall (1-3). After scoring 10 first-quarter points, the Panthers 
never threatened. They finished with 152 yards of total offense -- 46 on the 
ground -- and seven first downs. 
</P>
<P>
Running back John Flores scored Franklin's only touchdown on a 13-yard run off 
left tackle. Five minutes later Julio Merino, who also starts at quarterback, 
kicked a 37-yard field goal to give the Panthers a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall scored in the third quarter on Jose Rodriquez's four-yard touchdown 
run that capped a 25-yard drive set up by a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Barristers had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but lost the 
ball on a fumble on the Franklin 27.

MYRICK LEADS WILSON OVER HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Chris Myrick led Wilson High School over Hollywood, 35-0, Friday 
night at Wilson in a matchup of undefeated, revived City football programs. 
</P>
<P>
Myrick rushed for 142 yards in 15 carries, made three interceptions and scored 
three touchdowns in the game before a crowd of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was also led by Luis Acosta on defense and offense. From his tight end 
position, Acosta caught eight passes for 101 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson (4-0) ended a three-game winning streak for Hollywood, which had entered 
this season with a 27-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, which has not won a City championship since it won four consecutive 
titles in 1975-78, punted only once and held Hollywood to three first downs in 
the first half as the Mules opened a 22-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Hollywood did not capitalize on Wilson's three first-quarter fumbles, 
Wilson scored its first touchdown when Sergio Estrada picked up Hollywood's 
dropped lateral pass and returned it 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made it 14-0 early in the second quarter with a nine-play, 67-yard drive 
that was capped by Myrick's six-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Myrick scored again late in the second quarter with an eight-yard run, set up 
by a 38-yard pass from Fernando Leyva to George Pantages. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Myrick scored again, when he returned his third 
interception game 65 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:49 left in the game, Wilson completed the scoring with a 28-yard pass 
play from reserve quarterback Zanonie Morales to Eddie Marez. 
</P>
<P>
Leyva completed 10 of 21 passes for 159 yards.

</P>
<P>
The winner, ridden by Kent Desormeaux under high weight of 121 pounds, paid $5 
to win as part of a favored entry with Polar Boy. The time trimmed a fifth of a 
second off the course record set by Sugarplum Gal on Oct. 7, 1989, and matched 
the world standard set by Frosty The Snowman at Woodbine in Toronto on June 18, 
1989.

LAGUNA MUSEUM SHOWS 20 FLAGS, BUT WAIVES 21ST; 
</P>
<P>
ART: ORANGE COUNTY'S LARGEST NEA GRANTEE EXCLUDES A CONTROVERSIAL PIECE FROM 
MARK HERESY'S 'FLAGS' EXHIBIT. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum, whose director has vowed to "abide by the rules" to 
secure a hefty sum of National Endowment for the Arts grants, has excluded a 
potentially controversial work from one of its current installations. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "Flags," includes 20 of 21 American flags that political artist 
Mark Heresy has fashioned out of such materials as bullets and buckshot shells, 
cut currency and human hair. But the 21st flag, "Freedom of the Press," a Stars 
and Stripes replica constructed of photos from pornographic magazines, has been 
left out. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum is Orange County's largest NEA grantee this year, having 
been awarded six grants totaling $222,500. Recipients of 1990 grants have been 
required to certify that they will not produce or present work that the NEA 
might consider obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Charles Desmarais on Thursday angrily defended the museum's 
omission of the flag and insisted that its exclusion was "absolutely not" 
influenced by fear of losing NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum's decision to display all but one of Heresy's flags was "a 
matter of selection" and that the excluded work was not specifically singled 
out. "I don't care if there were 50 flags," he said. "It's the job of the 
museum to make choices. . . . We didn't omit things. We select what we believe 
to be valuable and important to include for our public." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he considers "Freedom of the Press" to be not valuable or 
important, Desmarais replied: "You can draw your own conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Heresy said his flag works are an attempt to illustrate his view of America's 
bent toward censorship, militarism and materialism by infusing artifacts 
representative of those attitudes into the fabric of the nation's symbol of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of the porno-mag flag, he said, underscores the message he hopes 
to portray in the piece -- that America pretends to stand for freedom of 
expression yet institutionalizes censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"It just reinforces what the piece says," said the 25-year-old L.A. artist. 
"It's very much about hypocrisy. It's a very cynical piece." 
</P>
<P>
Heresy said, however, that he doesn't fault the Laguna museum for leaving out 
the flag. Instead, he said, he is "encouraged" that the rest of the exhibit was 
accepted at all by a museum in a predominantly conservative county. 
</P>
<P>
He credits Bolton T. Colburn, the museum's curator of collections. Colburn 
"really stuck his neck out on this," Heresy said. "It gives me hope that we can 
still do art and say something without (being censored) too heavily." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two dozen artists or arts groups, including the Bella Lewitzy Dance 
Company in Los Angeles, have rejected NEA funding this year because of the 
obscenity stipulation, which they contend is the equivalent of an 
anti-obscenity loyalty oath. Museum officials recently sent to the NEA an 
acceptance form for a $150,000 grant along with a letter that expressed 
objection to the certification but said "we will abide by the rules," Desmarais 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The "Flags" exhibit is scheduled to remain on display at the museum through 
Dec. 16.

RICK DU BROW: CBS SUSPENDS REGULAR PLAY AS GAMES BEGIN; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ONLY TIME AND RATINGS WILL TELL IF THE NETWORK'S COVERAGE OF 
POSTSEASON BASEBALL WILL BLOW ITS NEW-SEASON MOMENTUM. OPPOSING NETWORKS HOPE 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

<P>
CBS' folly? Or a grand slam? 
</P>
<P>
The next few weeks will tell, as longtime television doormat CBS, finally on a 
prime-time roll, now virtually has to suspend its regular nightly programming 
for . . . baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's the cream of baseball: the National and American League 
playoffs, unfolding this week and next, and then the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But will it blow CBS' new-season momentum? 
</P>
<P>
Will the women and kids that CBS desperately wants to attract tune out? 
</P>
<P>
True, CBS' strong Monday lineup could go untouched by the fall fever because 
there are no games scheduled on the nights that "Major Dad," "Murphy Brown," 
"Designing Women" and "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" deliver their dependable 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, will the eye-popping baseball deal that looked so good to CBS in 
1988, when it desperately needed something to keep it on the map, turn out to 
be an unexpectedly ill-timed, billion-dollar disaster? 
</P>
<P>
That is the extraordinary price CBS paid for the exclusive network TV rights to 
baseball for four years starting in 1990. Actually, it was $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Are Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Boston and Oakland the teams that can give CBS its 
money's worth? Oh, how CBS must have prayed for contenders from New York, Los 
Angeles and Chicago, with the ratings impact of their huge hometown audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's something magical about the playoffs and especially the World 
Series, where any team can capture the nation's fancy. And Oakland is surely 
one of the great teams of all time. 
</P>
<P>
But, yes, CBS is nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"When we bought baseball two years ago, people said, 'It'll really help your 
prime time' -- because we were doing so badly," says George Schweitzer, CBS' 
senior vice president of communications. "Now, people call and say, 'Aren't you 
concerned that you have all this baseball and your shows won't be on?' " 
</P>
<P>
If past ratings patterns repeat themselves, Schweitzer concedes, "The games 
will generally start slow, then build," capping with the World Series, which 
begins Oct. 16. With its first playoff game Thursday, CBS ran second to NBC for 
the night, although it did win the final hour of prime time. 
</P>
<P>
In the grand tradition of network sportsmanship, meanwhile, NBC and ABC will 
try to kill CBS during its baseball run. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group, makes no bones 
about it. He and his network are still bitter about losing the baseball 
franchise that once was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff has invested $30 million in female-oriented miniseries that make up 
11 of 17 hours of special programming that NBC is using against CBS' baseball. 
The first miniseries, "Jackie Collins' Lucky / Chances," begins Sunday and runs 
for six hours over three nights. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Oct. 15 and 16, NBC will offer another miniseries -- two separate 
films based on best-selling books: "Danielle Steel's 'Kaleidoscope' " and 
"Danielle Steel's 'Fine Things."' 
</P>
<P>
"It's about as nasty as you can get," Tartikoff says slyly about the 
competition. "It's just a little game, you know. CBS has done well. But we're 
in business. While we're not the Goliath we were a year ago, there's a great 
sense of spirit in going up against one of the great remaining events." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly another incentive for Tartikoff to sock across this counterprogramming 
is that all 11 hours of the two miniseries come from his network's in-house 
company, NBC Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying we're going to beat these games," says Tartikoff, "but I think 
that we can be competitive for the first week of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
CBS reportedly will lose millions because of the huge price it paid for 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Harbert, executive vice president of prime time for ABC, puts it politely, 
saying, "I don't think they're going to make any money" from the playoffs and 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff isn't so polite: "Whether CBS wants to admit it or not, those losses 
are big and real, and the advertising marketplace is depressed, and they're out 
there with a lot of (commercial) spots that are still unsold, according to our 
spies." 
</P>
<P>
OK -- but for viewers, including super baseball fan Tartikoff, the name of the 
game is still fun. And for CBS, there was plenty of good reason to lay out all 
that dough in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A little TV history. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When CBS came up with $1.1 billion for the national pastime, it was for a lot 
more than baseball. Dead in the water, directionless and depressed, CBS was 
making a statement that it was still in the network business to stay -- and 
here was an incredible gesture to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
The message was clear: CBS was starting to rebuild its framework as a real 
competitor, and the playoffs and World Series were a terrific weapon to promote 
its prime-time shows -- once it got shows worth promoting. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, CBS had no major sports events to hype its fall lineup, while NBC had 
the Seoul Summer Olympics and the World Series, and ABC had the National and 
American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But now it's 1990, and CBS is showing clearly how it intends to benefit from 
its new baseball launching pad. Just two days ago, as the playoffs began, the 
network streamlined its fall lineup -- dumping the flop "E.A.R.T.H. Force," 
giving Dan Rather's "48 Hours" a key new time slot and making numerous other 
strategic moves it could promote for the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the hype works remains to be seen, but at least underdog CBS -- the 
first network since 1975 to broadcast both the playoffs and World Series -- is 
in the ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball gives us a great attraction over the next few weeks," says 
Schweitzer. "Even a poor baseball performance will do better than our weekly 
average rating. Plus we keep intact our winning Monday night lineup. Plus we 
keep '60 Minutes' on the air as a lead-in to the Sunday games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our first year with this baseball package, and we have a lot of people 
looking at us, saying, 'Was it smart to do this?' Well, NBC and ABC had it all 
those years. And if they had their choice, they would still like to have 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly, maintains ABC's Harbert: "It would not be a smart move for 
this network. We've got a lot of successful shows. The deal was to take all of 
the baseball package or none, and we said to ourselves that we just don't want 
to take our programs off for the month of October and start in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our schedule to be based on our weekly series, and we want to engender 
as much loyalty for them as we can, and we think that keeping them on the air 
is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Harbert notes that ABC series performed spectacularly against an early playoff 
game last year, with "Who's the Boss?" getting 33% of the audience, "The Wonder 
Years" 35%, "Roseanne" 42%, "Chicken Soup" 30% and "thirtysomething" 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, says Tartikoff, baseball is high-octane broadcasting. "Nobody loves 
baseball more than I," he says, "but it can be counterprogrammed." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball -- it's more than a game.

OPERA AS MUSIC AND AS THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times music critic Martin Bernheimer gave readers a perceptive and sensitive 
review of the commendable musical achievements of the Music Center Opera's new 
production of "Idomeneo" ("Meddling With Mozart," Sept. 27). 
</P>
<P>
The conductor, orchestra and singers gave elegant, virtuoso performances, just 
as Bernheimer reports. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bernheimer's editors did us a disservice by not also assigning a 
theater writer to review this magical new production designed by Maurice 
Sendak. Bernheimer really misses the mark in his lengthy (70% of his review) 
diatribe against the stage direction and design of the production. 
</P>
<P>
The producers of this new "Idomeneo" remember that opera is theater as well as 
music. And this production is very good theater.

FACES . . . : FRANN SAYS GOODBY TO 'NEWHART' IMAGE AS A JACKIE COLLINS HEROINE 
</P>

Does Bob Newhart know about this? 
</P>
<P>
For eight seasons, actress Mary Frann played the sweet, sweater-clad wife of 
button-down Bob on the CBS comedy series "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
But she sheds her goody-two-shoes image, her sweaters and a lot more in NBC's 
miniseries "Jackie Collins' Lucky/Chances," which airs Sunday-Tuesday at 9 p.m. 
on KNBC. 
</P>
<P>
In the six-hour melodrama based on the two Jackie Collins' best-sellers, Frann 
plays the sultry Clementine who gives a young man (Vincent Irizarry) is Ph.D in 
sex education. 
</P>
<P>
The actress says she's been "real careful" about the projects she has done 
since "Newhart" ended in May. "I wanted to do something that would surprise 
people," she says. "The public, I think, is far more adaptable than people in 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Frann jumped at the opportunity to play such a savvy, sexy lady as Clementine. 
"I thought it would be outrageous, flamboyant, glamorous," she says. "I wanted 
to remind people that I was capable of playing many different roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's is a very rich powerful and glamorous socialite in the 1930s," purrs 
Frann. "She meets this character who is handsome and rough around the edges and 
becomes his tutor. She has her own set of rules. She doesn't care what people 
say." 
</P>
<P>
People will probably be saying a lot about Frann's steamy sex scenes with 
co-star Irizarry, including one in which she feeds him strawberries dipped in 
chocolate. "After we shot three scenes the first day, the next day we had to 
close the set," she recalls. "After they saw the dailies, we had 50 extra 
people on the set." SUSAN KING

DISPUTE OVER PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am tired of the religious bigots who keep trying to set the rules for what I 
should or should not see in a play at a theater in Costa Mesa. I am referring 
to the controversy surrounding "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You" 
at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
I think that the time has come for those religious tyrants, whose religious 
"sensitivities" are offended by anything and everything that does not agree 
100% with their little narrow-minded view of Cosmic Realities, to know that 
there are many ex-churchmen, like myself, who are offended by religious 
censorship and fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
The zealots, who would like to forbid me and anyone else from seeing this play, 
should realize that they are only making more and more enemies in the artistic 
community.

KRONOS PLAYS AT UC RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before flying off to Europe next week, the Kronos Quartet stopped Thursday 
night at UC Riverside to launch its 1990-91 season in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For fans of the pioneering, controversial and peripatetic San Francisco-based 
ensemble, that isn't much of a season. Besides its appearance Thursday, the 
quartet plays south of Bakersfield only two more times in this concert year: 
Jan. 12 at UCLA and Jan. 15 at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside, there were consolations, not the least of which were visual: 
Kronos now travels with both an audio engineer (Jay Cloidt) and a lighting 
designer (Larry Neff). At this performance, Neff provided atmospheric, 
ever-changing, unobtrusive lighting. 
</P>
<P>
The promised first hearing of a work by the West African composer, Foday Musa 
Suso, had to be put off -- Suso has not finished the piece, violinist David 
Harrington announced from the stage. But the scheduled world premiere 
performance of Peter Apfelbaum's "Lanterns and Cathedrals" did take place. 
</P>
<P>
Apfelbaum's often dissonant, sometimes neo-Renaissance score, 13-minutes in 
length and dense with activity, signals, like many of the works produced 
recently for Kronos, a resurgence of interest in basics: dancey rhythms, 
aerated instrumental textures, a blunt approach to form. It is both attractive 
and disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
Also disturbing and invigorating, John Zorn's recent (also 1990) "The Dead Man" 
grips the listener through discrete, grating, abrasive and hallucinatory sound 
events punctuated by dead silence. The four members of Kronos -- violinists 
Harrington and John Sherba, violist Hank Dut and cellist Joan Jeanrenaud -- 
proved, as always, capable of specifying exact musical and technical 
differences between each of these works. 
</P>
<P>
Justinian Tamusuza's, "Mu kkubo ery omusaalaba" replaced the unfinished Suso 
piece at the top of the program, and blithely; it is a brief and buoyantly 
rhythmic work clearly and charmingly in the key of G. 
</P>
<P>
The program closed with a fully realized, wondrously detailed, tight and 
impassioned revival of Alban Berg's Quartet, Opus 3. After that, there were 
encores, pieces by Kevin Volans and Jay Cloidt.

POP BEAT: IAN ASTBURY: FORCE BEHIND 'A GATHERING OF THE TRIBES'; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: THE CULT'S LEAD SINGER IS BRINGING TOGETHER A DIVERSE ROSTER OF ROCK, 
RAP AND POP ACTS FOR A TWO-CITY CONCERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've probably played that little game of dreaming up the perfect concert, the 
one with all your favorite acts on one bill regardless of genre. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Astbury of the Cult has. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in the front of the tour bus one day with my notebook, thinking, 
'Wouldn't it be great if I could take the records in my collection and see a 
festival with some of the best acts?'," the English singer recalled recently in 
his manager's Beverly Hills office. "Why not an event where you could see all 
this great music?" 
</P>
<P>
But where most people's fantasies remain just that, Astbury's dream is coming 
true. He's the force behind "A Gathering of the Tribes," a two-city/two-day 
festival bringing a diverse roster of rock, rap and pop acts -- and their 
audiences -- together, first today at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in the Bay 
Area, and Sunday at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Among the performers: rockers Iggy Pop, the London Quireboys and former Sex 
Pistol Steve Jones, rappers Public Enemy, Ice-T and Queen Latifah and the 
folk-oriented Michelle Shocked and the Indigo Girls. 
</P>
<P>
Astbury, an amiably chatty 28-year-old from Birkenhead, a town across the 
Mersey River from Liverpool, explained that as he discussed his vision with 
associates earlier this year, he was only expressing a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quality of life thing," he said. "I thought it would be great to put a 
diverse bill together and see if it could happen and introduce all the 
segregate groups to each other. But it was nothing more than conversation, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
But the Cult's agent, Bill Ellison, mentioned the idea to others, including 
promoter Bill Graham, who operates the Shoreline Amphitheatre, and Alex Hodges 
of the Nederlander organization, which runs the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill came back to me and said, 'Your festival's on,' " Astbury said. "I said, 
'What do you mean?' . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I had one vision and any excuse was not good enough," Astbury said. "Guns N' 
Roses should be doing it, but can't due to commitments. Tracy Chapman should be 
doing it. Living Colour, Ziggy Marley, Julian Lennon should be doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the lineup's diversity, Astbury believes, is enough to affirm his prime 
directive: "Us and them doesn't exist any more." The music will be supplemented 
by an appearance by the American Indian Dance Theatre and representation from 
various environmental and social-activist groups. 
</P>
<P>
One act conspicuous in its absence is Astbury's own. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want the Cult to play because I didn't want people to think we were 
using this to boost our career," Astbury explained. 
</P>
<P>
He does, however, plan to jam with Jones and perhaps one or two other acts. 
After all, he put together these shows as a fan, not as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the selfish reasons of having it was to see these acts perform," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still Tossin': The song "Tossin' and Turnin' " has one of rock's great 
openings. Bobby Lewis' leering delivery of the line "I couldn't sleep at all 
last night" proved as much a grabber when imitated in a recent breakfast cereal 
commercial as when the original held the No. 1 spot on the pop singles chart 
for seven straight weeks in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
But few would guess that in chart terms the song was the No. 3 biggest hit of 
the '60s, just behind the Beatles' "Hey Jude" and Percy Faith's "The Theme From 
'A Summer Place'." That will be one of the songs heard as the Legends of Rock 
'n' Roll two-night stand at the Greek Theatre concludes tonight, as Lewis makes 
his first Los Angeles appearance in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It means I've always got something to stick my chest out for," said Lewis, 62, 
who now lives in Newark, New Jersey. "And something to thank the mighty first 
God for."

'SHORT DOG'S' RAP: IT'S NOT MANTOVANI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back when everybody hated rap, "Short Dog's in the House" (Jive/RCA) is the 
stuff they thought they were hating, ultra-hardcore pimp rhymes from the 
streets of Oakland, droned over monotonous, bare beats. Too Short's raps are 
irresistible to old-school rap fans: nonstop litanies of his conquests and his 
kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
His rapping is formidable and unique, never straying from hip-hop's roots in 
macho streetcorner jive. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the flagrant misogyny here makes the album all but unlistenable to 
women -- especially the track where Ice Cube guests. This album sounds as if it 
cost about $500 to make, but it will probably go platinum, just like his last 
one did . . . even if the sharp rap remake of Donny Hathaway's 
black-consciousness anthem "In the Ghetto" never gets a second of airplay.

GAME 1: STEWART VS. CLEMENS; 
</P>
<P>
AL PLAYOFFS: PITCHING MATCHUP OVERSHADOWS PROWESS OF THE ATHLETICS AND RED SOX 
AS THEIR SERIES OPENS.

<P>
There's more to the first game of the American League playoffs than Dave 
Stewart pitching against Roger Clemens, the managers of the A's and Red Sox 
politely maintained Friday. Stewart and Clemens will face opposing hitters, not 
each other, tonight at Fenway Park, Oakland's Tony La Russa and Boston's Joe 
Morgan said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
They convinced no one. Without question, this series will take its tone from 
the meeting between Stewart and Clemens. Stewart symbolizes the efficiency of 
the defending World Series champion A's, and brilliant but sore-shouldered 
Clemens symbolizes the Red Sox, talented and occasionally accursed, whether by 
injury or fate. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handers ranked among the American League's top 10 in victories, 
earned-run average, strikeouts, innings pitched and complete games during the 
regular season. Stewart, 22-11 in his fourth consecutive 20-win season, edged 
Clemens (21-6) in victories, but Clemens' 1.93 earned-run average was the 
league's best and stingier than Stewart's 2.56. Stewart has six consecutive 
victories in matchups against Clemens since 1986, including three this season. 
A loss to Stewart could be devastating to the Red Sox, who must face 27-game 
winner Bob Welch in Game 2 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It should eliminate arguments," Stewart said of beating Clemens. "We had a 
saying in the neighborhood: If you beat the best, you are the best. If I was 
back in the neighborhood, I guess I could say I was the best." 
</P>
<P>
This game will be played in the Red Sox's neighborhood, where during the 1988 
playoffs Stewart heard racial slurs from fans while he warmed up in the A's 
bullpen. That has fueled an intensity that never seems to wane. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real disappointed because I had a real positive attitude about the city 
and the fans," Stewart said. "I don't want to (forget the incident). I've 
chosen to feed on it because it's proven to be a motivational factor to me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Clemens' record against Stewart, and Stewart's 4-0 record and 1.65 ERA 
against Boston this season, neither La Russa nor Morgan considered opening with 
another pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"You do whatever's best for your club. Everybody expects (Stewart) to start, 
including Bobby Welch," La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens will have six days of rest since his six shutout innings against the 
Toronto Blue Jays last Saturday in his first appearance since shoulder 
inflammation idled him for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Clemens is our big guy. We've got to have it that way." Morgan said. "We've 
certainly had many chances against Stewart. We've had men on countless times, 
and he keeps getting out of it. He's a challenging-type pitcher. When he gets 
in trouble, he reaches back for something extra." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens did not appear at a news conference Friday. Boston pitching coach Bill 
Fischer said Clemens "felt fine and is ready to pitch. After last Saturday, the 
biggest thing was that his back was a little stiff. He threw as great as he 
ever did last Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging Stewart's ability, the Red Sox remain optimistic about 
defeating him and the A's on the strength of a solid offense. Their .272 
batting average was 18 points higher than Oakland's, and their slugging and 
on-base percentages were slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we feel like we can beat everybody. When we're hitting like we're 
capable of hitting and we get good pitching, we can win," said left fielder 
Mike Greenwell, Boston's top hitter from Sept. 1 until the end of the season 
with a .423 average. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an awesome pitching staff. But like any great pitcher, you've got to 
get to Stewart early. The key for us tonight is to score some runs early and 
let Roger do his thing." 
</P>
<P>
The A's thing seems to be everything. From Rickey Henderson, the runner-up in 
the AL batting race; to Willie McGee, the NL batting champion; to Jose Canseco, 
who hit 37 home runs; and Mark McGwire, who drove in 108 runs, there's no letup 
in speed, power, production and pitching. Dennis Eckersley had 48 saves in 50 
opportunities -- four more saves than the entire Red Sox bullpen. The A's staff 
ERA of 3.18 was also the league's best. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed might be a big factor," said Henderson, who hit .400 and stole a 
playoff-record eight bases last year in Oakland's five-game victory over 
Toronto. Those feats earned him most valuable player honors in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of speed, and if we get on, we're going to use it," added 
Henderson, who was five for 16 against the Red Sox this season with three home 
runs, nine RBIs and three stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart probably will pitch again in Game 4 Wednesday in Oakland and could come 
back in a seventh game, if needed; Clemens' availability for a fourth game is 
doubtful because of his shoulder problems. The later in the series, the better 
Stewart is likely to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"Where a lot of guys get into a game of big significance and put additional 
pressure on themselves and get tight and nervous and aren't able to execute, 
games like that don't faze Dave Stewart," Oakland pitching coach Dave Duncan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to win their third consecutive AL championship should be motivation 
enough for the A's to avoid becoming overconfident. "If you don't handle it 
right, being the favorite could be a problem," La Russa said. "We put enough 
pressure on ourselves all along, (so) it's not going to be something new."

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As countless baseball players from eliminated teams were heartened to learn 
Friday, there are worse places to be this month than on the farm or in front of 
a television set. 
</P>
<P>
They could be in left field at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
For a second consecutive National League championship series game, that 
innocent-looking patch of artificial turf has sullied the reputation of an 
All-Star outfielder. This time it was Pittsburgh's Barry Bonds, who lost a fly 
ball in the sun in the fifth inning of a tie game, turning Paul O'Neill's out 
into a run-scoring double that gave the Cincinnati Reds a 2-1 victory over the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Before 54,456, the Reds tied the series at one game apiece, thanks to good 
relief pitching from Rob Dibble and Randy Myers, memorable defense by O'Neill 
and Barry Larkin and a mid-afternoon starting time. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which is televising the playoffs, had wanted this game to begin at 3:20 
p.m. here instead of the usual 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever decided that does not know a thing about this stadium," said Herm 
Winningham, Reds' outfielder. "The sun is terrible during that time. You just 
hope you can see fly balls. It was an unbelievable decision." 
</P>
<P>
For most of Friday's game, the sun was directly in the eyes of the left and 
center fielders. When O'Neill lofted a two-out fly to Bonds with Winningham on 
second base in the fifth inning, Bonds was blinded. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw the ball after it came off the bat," Bonds said. "I kept waiting 
for it to come out of the sun, but it never came out. I put down my sunglasses 
and it was still in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Bonds ran hesitantly toward the wall, staring helplessly into the sky, when 
suddenly the ball dropped out of his reach and against the wall. Winningham, 
running because there were two out, scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun was so bad and so directly in your eyes it seemed to expand the whole 
field," Bonds said. "It's ridiculous when you have to play in that kind of 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Bonds' misplay followed that of the Reds' Eric Davis, who had problems of his 
own in Game 1. Davis allowed the go-ahead run to score when he misjudged a fly 
ball in left field and turned it into an RBI double in the Pirates' 4-3 
victory. In each case, both the batter and pitcher were left-handed and the 
ball was sliced. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would believe it?" asked Pirate outfielder Andy Van Slyke. "Two great 
players, two fly balls that could have been caught, two doubles. What a strange 
game." 
</P>
<P>
For the Reds, who defeated Pirate ace Doug Drabek the day after the Pirates had 
beaten Cincinnati ace Jose Rijo, it was an inspirational game. 
</P>
<P>
Their starting pitcher, Tom Browning, was so shaky he gave up six hits and 
three walks through six innings. After that, the Reds played like a team that 
lost only six of 80 games this season when leading after six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was what will be remembered here as simply "The Throw." 
</P>
<P>
After Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla had begun the sixth inning against the tiring 
Browning with singles, Bonds hit a line drive to O'Neill in right field. Van 
Slyke tagged at second base. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought -- and I was actually thinking this while I was running -- that I 
would soon be on third base with one out and could tie the game easily," Van 
Slyke said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said he didn't think. He simply grabbed the ball, cocked his left arm 
and threw to third. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a play you work on over and over again in the minor leagues," O'Neill 
said. "I just got it and reacted." 
</P>
<P>
He was faster than Van Slyke, it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw our third base coach (Gene Lamont) yelling at me to slide and I thought, 
'Uh-oh,' " Van Slyke said. "Then I heard the ball whizzing by my head and I 
said, 'Uh-oh,' again. Then I heard the umpire ring me up and I said, 'Uh-oh,' 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"That's three uh-ohs, two outs and we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
When Chris Sabo made the tag and third base umpire Jerry Crawford called Van 
Slyke out, the crowd leaped to its feet and O'Neill pumped his fist. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
"I would take that chance again, because it had to be a perfect throw," Van 
Slyke said. "It was a perfect throw. I think it hit the base, it was so 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill has two outfield assists in this series, one fewer than the NL 
championship series record. He also has three hits in seven at-bats 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds ended the sixth inning by striking out. Dibble took over for 
Browning in the seventh and retired four of five batters, leaving the game 
after walking Jay Bell with one out in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of baseball's best bullpen duo then took over. Myers retired 
Van Slyke and Bonilla on fly balls to end the eighth. In the ninth inning he 
induced two ground-ball outs before walking Mike LaValliere. 
</P>
<P>
With LaValliere on first, Jose Lind, who was one for 15 against Myers, grounded 
to second, ending the game. That gave Myers the save, not that he didn't have 
some help. Shortstop Larkin went behind second base and grabbed consecutive 
grounders by Bonds and Reynolds to start the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had a hit," said Bonds, a leading candidate for the league's most 
valuable player award, but who has one single in seven at-bats in this series. 
"But it was just a thought." 
</P>
<P>
Said Larkin: "If I was him, I would have thought I had a hit, too. I mean, the 
ball was hit right up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
With two days off before the best-of-seven series resumes in Pittsburgh Monday, 
neither team is sure what to think. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Pirates are pleased that they at least earned a split here and can 
still win the series with a sweep at home. But after putting the first two 
runners on base twice in the first three innings Friday and failing to score 
each time, some are disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this series started, any of us would have been glad to get out of here 
with a split," Van Slyke said. "But the way we blew our chances today, I'm not 
happy. We could have won this game, and we know it." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are thrilled to have won with their strengths -- bullpen and defense. 
But they are concerned about their offense, which managed only five hits 
against Drabek Friday and 10 hits in two games. 
</P>
<P>
"We need timely hitting and more runners on base," Manager Lou Piniella said. 
"But no doubt, we needed this win today."

IS THERE A STRAWBERRY IN DODGERS' FUTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When wondering about next year for the Dodgers, one need only look back to the 
last weekend in August. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets were at Dodger Stadium. A Met outfielder, who is also 
baseball's most attractive potential free agent this winter, met a Dodger 
player in the outfield during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry stuck his toe to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he told me, 'This is where I am going to be standing next year,' " the 
Dodger player recalled. "He said, 'You wait, this is going to be my home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry wants to return to his Los Angeles roots and become a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers also want Strawberry, although club officials cannot admit it yet 
because of rules against tampering. 
</P>
<P>
When Strawberry declares his free agency the day after the World Series, as 
agent Eric Goldschmidt promised earlier this week, the talking will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, with his 37 homers and 108 runs batted in, will cost at least $4 
million a season. But many Dodger officials believe that money could buy them 
the division title that ultimately proved to be an unrealistic goal in this 
season of injuries and misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's addition would help the Dodgers not only on the field, but in the 
front office, because it would allow management to trade Kal Daniels for a 
starting pitcher or third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Dodgers' top power hitter with a team-leading 27 homers and 94 RBIs 
could be playing elsewhere next season. And he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers figure he is their most marketable commodity but Daniels, who is 
happy in Los Angeles, warned that such a trade might not be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get traded to a place I don't want to play, I am retiring," he said. 
"I've been to a place where I'm not happy (Cincinnati), and I don't want that 
situation again. I have saved my money, I can afford to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to like, Toronto, I call my agent and tell him to call a press 
conference, because I'm done." 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of Strawberry and the possible trading of Daniels could make for a 
busy winter. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will not publicly discuss winter moves until after the organizational 
meetings next week in Arizona, but the club's needs are as obvious as they are 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
They will need a center fielder because Kirk Gibson probably will not re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
They will need a left-handed relief pitcher because they don't trust the ones 
they have. 
</P>
<P>
They will need a third baseman because they will probably move Lenny Harris and 
Mike Sharperson to second base to fill the hole left by the probable departure 
of free agent Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
And they will need a starting pitcher in case Orel Hershiser cannot return from 
shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, even Manager Tom Lasorda admitted that the team's second-place finish 
this season was something of a miracle. A championship next season will take 
more than the same old tricks. It will take better players. 
</P>
<P>
How they might address these needs, by position: 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder: In the worst-kept secret this season, Kirk Gibson wants to play 
closer to his Detroit home. His recent slump and benching by Lasorda cemented 
what will probably be a parting of the ways. 
</P>
<P>
The top candidate for this position is Stan Javier, who has the backing of some 
members of upper management. And with his .297 average, he seems to have earned 
a chance. 
</P>
<P>
But because he has never been a regular in parts of five big league seasons, 
will this produce-now-or-be-benched organization agree to give him his first 
chance? 
</P>
<P>
If not, they will probably pursue Oakland free-agent center fielder Willie 
McGee, who some believe they should have acquired earlier this year while he 
was still in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Left-handed relief pitcher: An effective player in this position this year 
might have helped the Dodgers win the division title. 
</P>
<P>
They obviously didn't consider Pat Perry or Ray Searage effective, refusing to 
pitch either in the final month. 
</P>
<P>
Look for them to pursue potential free agent Ken Dayley of St. Louis to fill 
this role. He has battled injuries, but still was 4-3 with a 3.01 earned-run 
average in his first 54 appearances this year. 
</P>
<P>
Also potentially available as a free agent is Houston's Juan Agosto and, 
although he is perhaps too expensive for a team with two closers, the New York 
Yankees' Dave Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Third Baseman: The Dodgers are not sure that Jeff Hamilton will be able to 
return from shoulder problems that perhaps could have been repaired surgically. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hamilton chose to rehabilitate the shoulder instead, he could well 
learn next spring that he still needs surgery. The Dodgers do not want to base 
a starting job on that risk. 
</P>
<P>
With Harris and Sharperson probably moving to second base when the unhappy 
Samuel departs, the Dodgers figure to have a hole that some people think can be 
filled from within. 
</P>
<P>
During the club's meetings next week, minor league officials will be speaking 
loudly on behalf of Dave Hansen, who starred in his first season at triple-A 
Albuquerque. But others may consider him unproven. 
</P>
<P>
If Hansen's backers lose the argument, the Dodgers will probably pursue yet 
another potential St. Louis free agent, Terry Pendleton. This is also an area 
where Daniels could bring an experienced starter in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Starting pitcher: A projected season-opening rotation would include Ramon 
Martinez, Tim Belcher, Fernando Valenzuela, Mike Morgan and Jim Neidlinger. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a rotation that allows club officials blissful sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Among potential free agents are Ted Higuera of Milwaukee, Tom Browning and 
Danny Jackson of Cincinnati, Mike Boddicker of Boston and Zane Smith of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the most intriguing potential free-agent pitcher. Anybody for the 
return of Bob Welch?

ANGELS TURN AWAY FROM PORT IN STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cold war in the Angels' front office is finally over and if Mike Port 
didn't quite hand over his sword, he totes a smaller model today. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Port's Angels were a one-man show. His title was nearly as long 
as one of his declarative sentences -- Executive Vice President-General 
Manager-Chief Operating Officer -- and his responsibilities ranged from trades 
to player development to contract negotiations to marketing to community 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
If it said Angels, Port oversaw it. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Port has overseen: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hiring of a senior vice president in charge of baseball operations, Dan 
O'Brien, who now negotiates most Angel player contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The rehiring, for two more years, of Manager Doug Rader on the stipulation 
that Rader would have a greater say in trades, scouting and player development. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hiring Thursday of Richard M. Brown as Angel president and CEO, who now 
ranks as Port's superior and answers only to Gene and Jackie Autry. 
</P>
<P>
The erosion of Port's power base has mirrored, roughly, the erosion of Devon 
White's hitting skills. Port wasn't sent down to the minors, but he no longer 
bats leadoff in the Angels' organizational directory. The Autrys detected a 
hitch in his swing, so to speak, and have enlisted special assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt for a long, long time that Mike Port and Dan O'Brien had a load on 
their shoulders that was perhaps too heavy," Gene Autry said. "I'm very happy 
to welcome Rich Brown. We think he can fill the job and take some of the weight 
off Dan O'Brien and Mike Port." 
</P>
<P>
Port is now Angel general manager, nothing more. He will still investigate 
trade and free-agent possibilities, but the final say in any personnel matter, 
in Brown's words, "goes to me and the ownership." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rader's voice in any personnel matter got a whole lot louder. 
In Brown, Rader has gained a major ally. 
</P>
<P>
"I endorse Doug Rader and his comments, specifically with respect to renewed 
emphasis on minor league baseball operations and scouting," Brown said. He also 
sat in on Rader's recent contract talks. "I vigorously supported the contract 
extension," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is also aware of the midseason communication breakdown between Rader and 
Port. He wants the phone lines repaired and the buttons on the dial punched 
often. 
</P>
<P>
"What suffered was trying to do things succinctly," Brown said. "Within the 
organization, some people didn't have the opportunity to express some of their 
concerns. Problems were addressed but perhaps they could have been addressed 
more timely. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . To me, if I'm going to deal the manager some cards and he's going to 
play them, he's got to at least tell me what cards he needs. I'm sure he and 
Mike got along and had done that, but I'm going to stress that. When we talk 
about long-term planning, the manager has to be an integral part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has the right ideas. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't altogether clear, at this early juncture, though, that he is the right 
man for the job he has been given. 
</P>
<P>
According to Autry, Brown is "very well qualified to take this job because he's 
a baseball fan and because he's a native of L.A." So are a scant 6 or 7 million 
others, so it's a good thing Autry didn't post the position. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's background in baseball rivals that of your basic season ticket-holder. 
Owner of a satellite dish, he claims to have seen every Angel game either on 
screen or in person for the last four or five years. But so has Al Conin. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also played baseball at Los Angeles High School in the '60s -- average 
catcher, average hitter -- and semipro softball later, which, he concedes, 
"sounds ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he has spent nearly 10 years as the Angels' general counsel, 
nearly five on the club's board of directors and negotiated the team's 
broadcast packages with KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, he's a lawyer in love with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK for "L.A. Law," but what about the American League West? 
</P>
<P>
"There have been two lawyers who, I think, have achieved more than a modicum of 
success in baseball," Brown argues. "(Oakland General Manager) Sandy Alderson 
and (Chicago White Sox owner) Jerry Reinsdorf. I also believe Walter O'Malley 
was a lawyer by training." 
</P>
<P>
At least Brown doesn't sound like a lawyer. "I'm the kind of person who, if I 
go to a party and there are other attorneys there, I run," he said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
So that's the trade the Angels have made. A lawyer who talks like a general 
manager takes over for a general manager who talks like a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Port has made some good trades (Lance Parrish, Luis Polonia, 
Dave Winfield), jump-started the Angels' farm system in the mid-1980s and 
rooted out the right manager after Operation Cookie crumbled. But the Great 
Communicator he is not. One of Autry's stated reasons for hiring Brown was that 
he possesses "great people skills." Skeptics must be won back. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Port says he is pleased with the new arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, absolutely," he said. "You all know my background is in baseball. It makes 
sense that I now get back to baseball, 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next, the Angels can get back to .500.

KIMBLE ENDS ONE-DAY HOLDOUT; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: FORMER LOYOLA STAR AGREES TO FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT, WORTH $1.45 MILLION 
A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day late and no worse for the wear, Greg (Bo) Kimble joins the NBA and the 
Clippers today, the owner of a five-year contract worth $7.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
As holdouts go, this was mild. Not only will Friday's announcement that Kimble 
had an agreement in principal with the Clippers mean that the former Loyola 
Marymount scoring star could will make it in for the second day of training 
camp at Cal Poly Pomona, the deal took only a week to complete. By Clipper 
standards, that's the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Clippers who held off until last Friday before making their first 
offer, waiting to see what pick No. 7, Lionel Simmons of Sacramento, and No. 9, 
Willie Burton of Miami, would get. Upon seeing they received an average of $1.4 
million and $1.25 million annually, respectively, the Clippers offered Kimble, 
No. 8, $1.34 million over six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The response stunned the Clippers. According to a source, agent Leonard 
Armato's most recent proposal asked for a $1-million loan, a BMW, a base salary 
in the range of five years at $7.5 million and a staggering clause: If Kimble 
made the all-star team two seasons in a row, he automatically would become an 
unrestricted free agent. Laughable only begins to cover the Clipper reaction to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Previous demands, the source said, had been for a $1-million signing bonus and 
$100,000 for making appearances on behalf of the team, a stipulation that no 
other player has in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers came back with a $1.4 million-per average, but considered the 
matters of early free agency, appearance money, a loan and signing bonus 
non-negotiable. They also held firm on having some of the money deferred. When 
Armato got an extra $50,000 a season and incentive clauses for Kimble being 
named rookie of the year, an all-star or All-NBA, among others, the deal was 
done, needing only signatures and a player physical to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, but not expedient? 
</P>
<P>
"If Leonard Armato had proposed at the start a deal at $1.5 million a year and 
no strange provisions, this agreement would have been concluded in 24 hours," 
Clipper attorney Bob Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
Armato had his victories, mostly that his client not be "slotted in" to money 
based on what the players surrounding Kimble got, based on cost-of-living and 
marketing possibilities in Los Angeles vs. Sacramento. In the end, Kimble's 
$1.45 million average topped Simmons by $50,000 per season, also enough to 
convince them to agree to $800,000 of the total package being deferred. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not about dollars," Steele said. "The dollars the Clippers were 
offering in the beginning were always fair. The issues that would not allow us 
to close the deal were the demands they made that were totally unacceptable. 
Once they dropped those demands, we were able to close." 
</P>
<P>
Said Armato, declining to discuss specifics of the deal: "I'm certainly 
delighted to have an agreement in principal. I know Bo has been looking forward 
for quite some time to this day, to be in a position to have financial security 
and show the enormous talent he brings to the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
One other Clipper personnel matter was resolved Friday, with far less fanfare. 
The offer sheet Joe Wolf signed with Denver was not matched, the Clippers 
allowing their former No. 13 pick to go to the Nuggets without compensation. 
The move came as no surprise, most of all to Wolf. 
</P>

Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Williams, the director of publicity for the Dodgers the last three 
seasons, has been named vice president of public relations for the Clippers. . 
. . Ron Harper attended the opening day of camp but did not work out with the 
team. He did, however, do some light running while wearing a brace to support 
his injured right knee. Contract talks between the restricted free agent and 
the Clippers continue, with both sides reporting progress. . . . Danny Manning 
is expected to miss the first three days of practice because of a sprained 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant, back after missing the final three months of 1989-90 with a broken 
ankle, is now represented by boxing promoter Don King, like teammate Benoit 
Benjamin. . . . Keith Lee, the 11th pick in the 1985 draft, chose to pursue 
other opportunities instead of coming to camp here after playing with the 
Clippers in a summer league. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Schuler on the opening of training camp: "I've been looking forward 
to this day, Oct. 5, since May 25 (the day he was hired). It's been a long, 
slow, drawn-out deal. Now that it's here, I'm real excited. I have done 
everything humanly possible to get ready for the season. I've met with each 
player and gotten input from them on how they view the team. We as a staff have 
gone away for about a week and put together the system of what we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers will leave Pomona Wednesday, making it a shorter stay than usual. 
After a four-game trip to open the exhibition schedule, they will finish 
two-a-day practices at the Sports Arena and the Westwood Recreation Center. The 
regular season begins Nov. 2.

DUNLEAVY'S CLUB FINALLY GETS GOING; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: NEW COACH, OLD PLAYERS BEGIN THEIR GETTING-TO-KNOW-YOU PROCESS IN 
HAWAII.

<P>
Mike Dunleavy became an NBA coach Friday as the Lakers opened camp under a new 
boss for the first time in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy, the former Milwaukee Buck assistant who succeeded Pat Riley, said he 
was happy to begin at last and enjoyed his debut at practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing different, I've never coached this level of talent," Dunleavy 
said. "They had a terrific attitude. It's what I'd heard about this team and 
it's very true." 
</P>
<P>
The players seemed to welcome Dunleavy, strange though it was to have a new man 
with a new system running the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Felt like a fresh start," Mychal Thompson said, "and that's no knock against 
Riley. Every family has problems. You have fights with your brothers and 
sisters. Me, I like everybody pretty much except Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
Said Magic Johnson: "I think it's comfortable, but I think also we're 
definitely checking each other out. I think he (Dunleavy) is feeling his way. 
We're feeling our way." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have 18 players here. Ten are solid -- the starters (Johnson, James 
Worthy, Vlade Divac, Byron Scott and A.C. Green) plus Thompson, Sam Perkins, 
Terry Teagle, Larry Drew and rookie Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie guard Tony Smith, the No. 2 draft choice from Marquette who was 
impressive in the summer league, has the inside track for the 11th spot. If he 
wins it, 6-foot-6 swingman Tony Brown, a former New Jersey Net and Buck, is 
considered the leading contender for the last spot. 
</P>
<P>
A darkhorse: Phillip Holmes, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound guard from Western Michigan, 
is given a chance to make it tough on Tony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Longshots: returning guard Steve Bucknall; rookies Keith Smith of California 
and Ken Redfield of Michigan State and journeyman Michael Young. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers were in a funk at midsummer, after other NBA Western Conference 
contenders geared up and they couldn't close a deal for Hot Rod Williams, it's 
over. The Teagle deal ended it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "It's going to work. It'll work great. Our second five will be 
potent. We used to have role guys (coming off the bench). That won't be the 
case anymore. We've got guys who can light up the scoreboard. That'll be a 
difference since I've been here, since Bob (McAdoo). 
</P>
<P>
"We've got two guys coming off our bench who used to be starters on two other 
teams, who legitimately can score. I mean, they're used to shooting the ball 
and used to putting it in. We don't have to make them scorers. Now we add 
Mychal Thompson and Larry Drew. That's four guys coming in. You need three-four 
guys that can score. That's how Detroit has won championships." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaving out a guy because he's going to be a sleeper," Johnson said, "and 
that's Elden (Campbell). 
</P>
<P>
"He's got some talent. If he can give us half of what you see he can do, he 
could be the difference. I mean, he can block shots, jump. Today he was 
running, oh man . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, the 6-10 forward from Inglewood's Morningside High School and 
Clemson, carries a college reputation of getting up for big games and down for 
little ones. General Manager Jerry West got him with the next-to-last pick in 
the first round, but he has been impressive, reportedly tearing up Danny Ferry 
in a summer league game. 
</P>
<P>
Gone from a year ago are Riley, Michael Cooper and Orlando Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange to look around and not see Riles' slicked-back hairdo," Thompson 
said. "And not see the thin man, Michael Cooper. It was weird. And not hear 
Orlando's boisterous laughter. And seeing Orlando hunched over in the corner 
gasping for breath after a few running drills." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "The thing I'll miss the most -- I had a guy who was on my butt 
when I wasn't doing things right. Coop was that guy. When he said, 'OK, take 
the game over Buck, it's winnin' time,' then I would go into my thing. . . . He 
was the guy I always talked to about different things, whether it was about the 
team or not."

NOT EVERYONE LIKES THE NAME, BUT THESE GUYS REALLY ARE NASTY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Myers was the originator of the nickname. He thought it was appropriate 
that the Cincinnati Reds' bullpen be called "the Nasty Boys." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the volatile behavior of Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton, and his own 
loony act, they should be grouped together, particularly considering he was 
going to be the bullpen stopper. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wish everyone would forget about that label," Dibble said. "I got 
enough trouble living down my reputation. I think hitters hate us as it is. We 
don't need anything else to psych them up." 
</P>
<P>
But there it was Friday, for all the world to see. The Reds, clinging to a 2-1 
lead, put Dibble into the game for 1 1/3 innings, and Myers into the game for 
the final 1 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates didn't have a chance. They failed to get a hit in the final three 
innings, their only offense consisting of two walks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question as to why they call those guys the nasty boys," Pirate 
Manager Jim Leyland said. "They're aggressive pitchers. They're outstanding. 
They're, well, nasty." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pirate outfielder Barry Bonds: "They say Dibble is one of the best control 
pitchers in the game, but when I'm up to bat against him, it looks like he 
doesn't know where the ball's going. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't bat against him today, and I'm glad." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' bullpen is the reason they are given a chance to win this series. The 
Pirates may be the more dominant team, particularly with their all-star 
outfield, but the Cincinnati bullpen is its mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives us a big advantage," Red catcher Joe Oliver said. "With our 
bullpen, we tell our starters just to go six innings. We don't want them to go 
any more. Just give us a hard six." 
</P>
<P>
There will be one more National League playoff game and two American League 
playoff games beginning in mid-afternoon this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates and Reds warned that, as in Friday's game, the sun problems could 
make those games ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"During this time of the year, it's ridiculous everywhere to play at that 
time," Pittsburgh's Gary Redus said. "Ask any player who takes batting practice 
late in the season. It's almost impossible to see because of the low afternoon 
sun. And they are playing these games at the same time we usually take batting 
practice?" 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Andy Van Slyke: "Let me tell how bad it was (Friday). There is a 
fly ball hit to me in center field, and I don't even know that it is hit to me 
until I look at the infielders and they are all staring at me. I figure, then, 
the ball is in my vicinity and I should catch it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Cincinnati's Barry Larkin: "I just don't know why they are starting at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
The answer, of course, is television -- and CBS' reluctance to interfere with 
certain prime-time scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether television was controlling baseball, Commissioner Fay 
Vincent said: "Let me ask you -- is advertising controlling newspapers? I will 
just say that television is very important to baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent added: "The dates for these playoff games were determined by the 
lockout (last spring). Under those circumstances, we are actually very 
fortunate that television was able to accommodate us." 
</P>
<P>
Pirate third baseman Jeff King was forced to leave the game in the second 
inning with a bruised lower back. He suffered the injury sliding into second 
base when he was picked off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing serious," he said. "I dived back into second base a million times 
during the course of the year, and this time, I just felt a little pain. I 
think a few days' rest and I'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jackson, the Reds' Game 3 starter against Pittsburgh's Zane Smith Monday, 
snapped when asked about shoulder problems that have periodically sidelined him 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last time I am going to answer this question," he said. "I am 
fine. There is nothing wrong with me. I want no more questions about this."

<P>
Rob Dibble, perspiring and shaking uncontrollably, was leaning over the 
bathroom sink in the early hours of Friday morning. His wife, Joanne, awakened 
by the coughing, looked up and began crying in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
Dibble, his eyes glazed, looked down and saw the sink was spattered with blood. 
It was happening again. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't told too many guys about this," Dibble said Friday, "but I've been 
spitting up blood all season. I know why it's happening, but it's like I'm 
afraid to tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking so many drugs right now, so many pain-killers, pumping so many 
inflammatory drugs into my body, that I've got an ulcer. It's disgusting -- all 
of the pills I'm taking. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to stop. I've got to get off the drugs. If I don't . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Dibble stopped abruptly. He closed his eyes, perhaps hoping for the thought to 
vanish. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't," Dibble said, "I'll be dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Because what I'm doing right now is killing myself." 
</P>
<P>
The drugs that he has taken, Dibble said, have become a necessity. He has a 
bone spur in his left elbow. He has torn cartilage below the rotator cuff. His 
right knee constantly aches. 
</P>
<P>
"And for what?" Dibble said. "To go out there and ruin my career. I've probably 
taken a few years off it because I throw as hard as I can every time out, and 
not once have I ever said I'm tired and can't pitch." 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati clubhouse was virtually empty as Dibble described his ordeal 
after the Reds' 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, which tied the 
National League playoffs at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Dibble was one of the day's stars. He pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings, setting up 
the save for Randy Myers, and has faced eight batters in this championship 
series. Five have struck out, two have failed to hit the ball out of the 
infield and one has walked. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have Rob this season, we're not here, it's that simple," said Tom 
Browning, the Reds' winning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Compliments are nice, and the ovation by the crowd of 54,456 was special. But 
Dibble has news for his teammates and the Reds' organization: 
</P>
<P>
This is it. When the season ends, he wants out. Oh, he still is 3 1/2 years shy 
of qualifying for free agency, but if the Reds don't trade him, he'll force a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, when I was throwing up and my wife was crying," Dibble said, "it 
finally hit me. It was the last straw. I asked myself, 'What am I doing this . 
. . for? What the hell am I doing?' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm punishing myself, destroying my body, for an organization that couldn't 
care less about me. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care where, they can trade me wherever they wish, but get me out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Dibble, considered one of the premier setup relievers in the game, realizes 
that the timing of his remarks might cause considerable trouble. When your team 
is in the playoffs, the last thing fans want to hear about is salary 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give a . . . what people think about me," he said. "The average fan 
has no idea what I've been through. I helped bring this team a championship, 
and they can take the rest from here. 
</P>
<P>
"This organization doesn't have any respect for me, none at all. . . . You just 
look at the guys that have gone through here, just because they didn't want to 
pay them. I sat next to Kal Daniels (now with the Dodgers) for two years, and I 
knew what he went through. It's sick that he's not here; we're all sick about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same with all of the others. Why do you think Rob Murphy left? Why do 
you think Dave Parker left. Why do you think (Nick) Esasky left? Why do you 
think a lot of us will be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason they had to pay Eric Davis ($9.2 million for three years) is 
because they would have been run out of town if they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But the rest of us, they're not going to pay, and once this season ends, I 
guarantee you I won't abuse my body for them ever again." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, after compiling a 1.82 earned-run average in 37 games, Dibble asked 
for $100,000. He was offered $90,000 and told that if he didn't take it, he'd 
be renewed at $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to shove it," he said. "It was an insult." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he went 10-5 with a 2.09 ERA, pitching 99 innings, and was offered 
$200,000. Dibble again was renewed for that salary. 
</P>
<P>
This time, after going 8-3 with a 1.74 ERA, earning an All-Star berth, Dibble 
plans to ask for close to $1 million. The Reds, his agent has informed him, 
probably will counter with less than $350,000. He is just short of sufficient 
major league service to be eligible for salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll tell them to go to hell," Dibble said. "Next time, I'm not playing 
their game. I just won't. I'll just sit out all spring training, and be such a 
pain for them that they'll have to trade me. 
</P>
<P>
"I can hear the Reds already, and everyone's going to be saying here's another 
greedy ballplayer. But I'll tell you what, they're the greedy ones. They're the 
ones making $14 million on TV. We're just their puppets, and I'm tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
"But I just refuse to throw my career down the tubes for them. I refuse to keep 
pumping my body full of drugs for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all coming to an end, and hopefully when it's all over, I'll be wearing a 
World Series ring. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I'll say goodby."

NEWSWIRE: 38 SOVIETS TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Track and field athletes Natalya Yermolovich and Yelena Podkopayeva were among 
38 Soviets who tested positive for drugs, including steroids, a sports official 
said in an article published in the newspaper Sovietsky Sport. 
</P>
<P>
It did not say if any action was taken against the athletes, 16 of whom were 
track and field competitors. 
</P>
<P>
But because the story was given prominence on the front page of the newspaper, 
some disciplinary action against Yermolovich and Podkopayeva is almost certain. 
</P>
<P>
N. Ivanov, a member of the anti-doping committee of the Soviet Olympic 
Committee, reported that a false medical certificate had been made out for 
Yermolovich, who finished sixth in the javelin throw at the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The medical certificate, apparently drawn up by Yermolovich's trainer, 
identified only as Medvedev, stated that she had been undergoing medical 
treatment that included the use of the anabolic steroid narabol. The trainer 
had prevailed upon a doctor to sign the document, the report said, adding that 
other documents also were falsified. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Podkopayeva, a middle-distance runner, participated 
in the European Championships at Split, Yugoslavia, Aug. 27-Sept. 1, even 
though a preliminary test before the Goodwill Games at Seattle in July showed 
the presence of a steroid in her blood.

The Rwandan capital, Kigali, was reported quiet as French, Belgian and Zairian 
troops arrived to help defend against rebel attack. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, heavy gunfire was reported near the presidential palace, an army 
barracks and the airport. An Air France plane took out 139 people as Westerners 
sought to escape fighting in the small Central African nation. President 
Juvenal Habyarimana said his government had turned the tide against the rebel 
invasion.

More than 1,000 people angered by alleged police corruption took to the streets 
of a crime-ridden neighborhood in Osaka, burning barricades and pelting 
Japanese riot police with firebombs and rocks. 
</P>
<P>
At least 106 people, including 83 police officers, have been injured in several 
days of violence. The run-down neighborhood is known for its gangs, transient 
laborers and shabby hotels. The protest was touched off by the arrest of a 
local police officer on suspicion of taking $81,000 in bribes from two 
gangsters.

A 40-year-old Soviet man hijacked a Soviet airliner to Helsinki and threatened 
to blow it up before surrendering at the city's airport. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities promptly asked for the extradition of Nikolai I. Selivano, 
who had applied for political asylum in Finland. Finnish authorities said the 
hijacker commandeered the airliner with 26 people aboard during a domestic 
flight from Novgorod to Petrozavodsk near the Finnish border and demanded to be 
flown to Stockholm. But the airliner landed in Helsinki because it was running 
low on fuel. The Soviet news agency Tass said the man turned out to be unarmed.

Cuba's ruling Communist Party moved to streamline its bloated party 
bureaucracy, slashing national and provincial party posts by 50% and 
reorganizing the powerful Central Committee. In reforms aimed at revitalizing 
the island's one-party political system, the Communist leadership said it will 
also introduce direct, secret voting and multiple candidates in coming 
elections for municipal and provincial party committees. Despite the moves, 
President Fidel Castro has made it clear that he does not intend to join the 
Soviet Union and its former allies in Eastern Europe in embracing multi-party 
politics and a market economy.

EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AFFECTS PLANS AT TWO MUSEUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI and JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by earthquake safety concerns, officials at the California Museum of 
Science and Industry have closed two of their major buildings, and directors at 
the Southwest Museum, facing $2 million in overdue repairs and seismic safety 
upgrades, are seeking a new home, perhaps abandoning the site that has housed 
their collection for more than 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the Science and Industry Museum, across from USC, executive director Jeffrey 
Rudolph on Thursday ordered the immediate closure of both the 1912 Ahmanson 
Building and the Armory Building on the "very strong recommendation" of Paul 
Neel of the Office of the State Architect who on Thursday found them to be 
potentially unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The action shuts about 100,000 square feet of museum exhibition space that 
houses, among other things, an earthquake simulation exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
James Dickason, chairman of the board of the Southwest Museum and a board 
member of the Science and Industry Museum, confirmed Friday night that 
prospects of having to spend $2 million in overdue repairs on a building that 
directors fear may have seismic safety problems contributed to the recent 
decision to seek a new home for the collection in the stately, Italianate 
building in the Mt. Washington area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Museum trustees have no location in mind, according to Dickason. He said they 
plan to announce their decision to relocate early next week, to gauge the 
interest of a number of Southern California cities in acquiring the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also must confront limitations of its picturesque but aging concrete 
main building. He said it suffers from seismic safety problems serious enough 
to prompt fears that its world-famous collection of Native American art and 
artifacts could suffer catastrophic losses in a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
For the Museum of Science and Industry, the decision to close the Ahmanson 
Building, an unreinforced masonry structure, means having to dismantle most of 
the museum's main exhibits, including one on earthquake safety, perhaps moving 
them to temporary buildings, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of schoolchildren have visited the exhibit, which simulates an 
earthquake with shaking floors and walls, and demonstrates how to prepare for a 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Museum Director Bob Campbell said the decision to close the buildings -- 
two of the six owned by the state in Exposition Park -- will have a 
"significant impact" on the ability of the museum to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to look at the possibility of temporary space to house our 
programs by bringing in temporary buildings," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
This week's inspection stemmed from a master plan preparation ordered two years 
ago by the state Legislature, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, a study determined that it would take about $54 million to bring 
the buildings up to code, Campbell said. Neel was invited to inspect the museum 
and offer planning advice. 
</P>
<P>
"He did that on Wednesday. On Thursday, he returned with a staff of experts to 
take a closer look," Campbell said. "They crawled into spaces and looked 
around. Then, Neel offered a strong recommendation to close the buildings to 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
A long-range planning study also led to the decision at Southwest Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last few days, museum trustees met with City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, who reportedly raised strenuous objections to the proposed move. He 
was told that only a massive infusion of $5 million to $10 million in new 
endowment and capital improvement money could keep the Southwest at its current 
location. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the museum's deliberations said the plans are largely 
undefined. "In a sense, it's a fishing expedition," said the source. "They 
don't know where they want to go. They just want to see who might want them."

BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR ANIMALS, VISITORS; 
</P>
<P>
ZOO: DIRECTOR'S SUDDEN RESIGNATION HAS LITTLE IMPACT, ALTHOUGH MOST EMPLOYEES 
BELIEVE HE WAS UNFAIRLY TREATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The elephants were busy bathing, and the anteaters weren't talking -- but they 
rarely do. Aside from occasional sightings of zoo employees conversing in 
hushed tones about director Warren Thomas' sudden resignation, it was business 
as usual Friday for animals and visitors alike at the Los Angeles Zoo, where a 
lazy, peaceful atmosphere prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Up along Bison Boulevard, Rhino Run and Gorilla Lane, few signs were evident of 
the controversy swirling around the Griffith Park facility, which is home to 
more than 500 species of mammals, birds and reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas announced his retirement Friday amid allegations by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture that the zoo had failed until three months ago to correct 
long-standing deficiencies such as inadequate sanitation and housing for the 
animals. The federal agency threatened to fine the city and revoke the zoo's 
license, and city officials launched their own probe into zoo management. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was unavailable Friday, but city officials said that the 16-year veteran 
resigned because the allegations of poor management were "denigrating" to the 
zoo and to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Several zookeepers, who spoke to a reporter on the condition that they remain 
anonymous, said that Thomas' abrupt resignation angered many of them, who 
believed he was unfairly maligned. Only one keeper said he welcomed Thomas' 
departure. All, however, were emphatic on one point: Contrary to the 
allegations of dilapidated gorilla houses and dirty refrigerators for polar 
bear treats, the animals were doing just fine. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy "doesn't affect them," said Arlene Lettau, nodding toward Ollie 
and Lady, the two anteaters she tends daily. Friday was like any other day for 
the long-nosed mammals. Lettau nudged them awake at 9:30 a.m. Then they waded 
into their private pool to perform their daily constitutional and just 
generally scratch around in the dirt until feeding time. 
</P>
<P>
Anteaters generally "don't say much," except when they're under stress, said 
Lettau. And on Friday, as on most days, all was excellent in anteater alley. 
They chowed down on a lunch of avocado mash, "bird of prey" hamburgers, cottage 
cheese and dog kibble. Ants and termites were for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, the elephants appeared equally unruffled. Ron and Dina Hall, antique 
dealers from Orange, were among the 1,100 visitors expected Friday. They leaned 
lazily against a rail, watching the elephants play a spirited game of 
toss-the-tire-over-the-moat. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God, listen to this!" said Dina as Billy and Becky, two of the zoo's 
Malaysian elephants, squealed at the sight of a rubber tire, retrieved from 
their moat by Lettau. They huddled around the tire, wrestled with it, curled 
their trunks around it, and heaved it first over the side and later into their 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
"They remind me of my two sons when they were little," Dina said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking refuge from the noon heat in a snack area was Ken Lichti of Camarillo, 
an amateur photographer who said he visits the zoo twice a year to take 
portraits of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Like most visitors queried on Friday, Lichti knew little of the problems at the 
zoo and said he saw nothing to justify concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in zoos a lot worse" than this one, he said. "This is not the San 
Diego Zoo" -- considered one of the world's best -- "but it's a good zoo. It's 
easy to get at and see most of the animals." 
</P>
<P>
Families leisurely strolled the grounds, unfettered by the large crowds of the 
past summer. Few complaints were heard, except about the seemingly omnipresent 
bees around the snack stands -- and about the scarcity of snack bars that were 
open. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is horrible, as usual," said Leslie Frischer of Santa Monica, who was 
heading out after a morning of animal watching with baby Kimberly strapped to 
her back and daughter Laura in a stroller.

HELP IS ON WAY, LONG BEACH'S CHIEF TELLS HIS OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to state crime statistics that show his officers trailing badly in 
solving many serious crimes, Long Beach Police Chief Lawrence Binkley said 
Friday that the department has been grossly neglected for 15 years but that 
"help is on the way." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial 49-year-old chief acknowledged the crime figures are 
"staggering," but said the department has been saddled with broken equipment, 
an outdated police lab and skeleton staffing for years. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.7 police for every 1,000 citizens in Long Beach, compared to 
2.6 per thousand in Los Angeles, Binkley said. The result, he conceded, is 
showing up in the latest California Department of Justice statistics that 
monitor the performance of police departments. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Long Beach police trailed nine major cities in 
California in solving rapes, robberies and burglaries. For all major crimes 
combined, Long Beach police solved 14% -- a performance worse than any of the 
cities surveyed from Sacramento to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But Binkley said the addition of 43 sheriff's deputies to assist the 
beleaguered department and several academy recruits due to arrive by November 
will help his 650 officers and detectives "march back up" to fight a relentless 
crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach has some of the finest police detectives anywhere in the nation. . 
. . There are just not enough of them," Binkley said. "And the victims are the 
citizens and the cops -- who really are great cops." 
</P>
<P>
The city has arranged for the sheriff's deputies to begin patrolling the north 
end of town in November, freeing dozens of local officers to concentrate on 
other parts of the city. That assistance also will reduce the workload in the 
detective bureau by 20%, Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate nothing but better policing in this city," Binkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives complained in recent interviews of being so overworked that rape 
cases can sit as long as six months on a desk without attention. Although the 
detective team has a first-rate reputation with the district attorney's office, 
prosecutors say some cases are lost in trial, dismissed or plea bargained away 
because the investigators are too stretched to do a thorough job. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have complained that Binkley's tough management style has driven 
morale to the ground, further crippling a department already struggling with a 
bare-bones budget and a staff to match. 
</P>
<P>
Binkley said he was hired three years ago to bring the department into the era 
of modern policing. When he arrived, he said, he found detectives' cars that 
wouldn't start and radios that were out of date. The narcotics team had no 
cellular phones, and some detectives were without bullet-proof vests. The 
helicopters, he said, were worn out, having flown 16 hours a day for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said he persuaded the city to hire 166 more officers. Even so, the 
department remains at the same staffing level it was at 10 years ago. Binkley 
also recently won two new helicopters, ordered hours of tough training and 
imposed strict discipline. He said he doesn't expect to be liked for all of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have an organization that has been neglected as long as this 
police department has, the officers will get angry. And they are angry at their 
chief," he said. "But they'll get over it. 
</P>
<P>
"What I really demand is that they work hard and treat the citizens well. If 
they don't like that, they should go someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, city officials reacted to the figures with some astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised and disappointed. We should have done better," said Mayor 
Ernie Kell. "But we are getting the situation under control." 
</P>
<P>
"These are just devastating comparisons," said City Councilman Les Robbins, who 
also is a sergeant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "This is 
an indictment of the entire organization. I don't see how anybody, from the 
chief on down, can say 'It ain't my fault.' Everyone has to share in some of 
the blame for this." 
</P>
<P>
Some officers have expressed concern that importing sheriff's deputies to 
protect a city that has been in the hands of a local police department for 84 
years is the beginning of the end for the Long Beach station. 
</P>
<P>
But Binkley stressed that it is just a reprieve to help the department bounce 
back. "If there is an increase in policing as we march back up, they will all 
be a lot happier," he said.

COCAINE ROLLS DOWN AMERICA'S INTERSTATES; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: AFTER LAST YEAR'S RECORD SYLMAR BUST, THE DEA FINDS THAT IT IS STOPPING 
ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE MASSIVE COAST-TO-COAST FLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
An investigation into last year's record cocaine seizure at a Sylmar warehouse 
shows that Colombian drug cartels have shipped vast quantities of cocaine along 
America's interstate highway system despite law enforcement efforts to choke it 
off, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Operation Pipeline, a joint DEA, state and local program 
designed to interdict drug-laden vehicles traveling coast to coast, has netted 
about five tons of cocaine annually, according to DEA figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar raid, however, revealed that 77 tons of the drug were shipped to the 
warehouse in the three months before the seizure. Of that amount, only 21 tons 
were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1989, the DEA said, 10,113 pounds of 
cocaine were seized on the nation's interstate highways as a result of 
Operation Pipeline. That figure represents about 5.6% of all the cocaine 
seizures reported to the DEA by federal, state and local agencies for that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
DEA investigators believe that big-rig trucks have become the vehicles of 
choice for drug cartels shipping cocaine from Mexico into the United States and 
say Operation Pipeline cannot completely shut down the massive flow. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect, or in any way consider, Operation Pipeline to be the panacea 
of the cocaine problem," said Charles Gutensohn, 
</P>
<P>
chief of cocaine investigations for the DEA. "It's one part of a strategy that 
goes from the hills of Bolivia to the streets of Boston. Each part of the 
strategy makes the transport (of cocaine) to the streets of the U.S. more 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar raid was the world's largest cocaine seizure. About 21.4 tons of the 
drug were found in the San Fernando Valley warehouse. Six men subsequently were 
indicted in connection with the cache and are currently on trial in federal 
court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One law enforcement source said the Sylmar operation sent much of its cocaine 
to New Jersey hidden inside tractor-trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days after the Sept. 28, 1989, raid, for example, authorities in Port 
Newark, N.J., seized a truck carrying 871 pounds of cocaine that originated at 
the Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine seized in New Jersey was packaged in 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) bricks 
concealed behind 27,000 pounds of red delicious apples. The cocaine, discovered 
by a drug-sniffing dog, was in a 45-foot tractor-trailer parked in front of a 
local hotel. The cocaine's street value, at the time, was estimated at $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Although the apples ostensibly were bound for Albany, N.Y., investigators said 
they believed the cocaine was going to be distributed in the northern New 
Jersey-New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
DEA investigators now believe that the Sylmar cocaine originated with the 
Medellin cartel in Colombia and was flown to Mexico, where it was temporarily 
stored in warehouses and "stash ranches" not far from the U.S. border. From 
there, it was driven across the border to El Paso, where investigators say it 
was shipped in big-rig trucks along Interstate 25 to Albuquerque, N.M., and 
then on Interstate 40 to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"You can drive throughout this country without fear of being stopped or going 
through police checkpoints," Gutensohn said. "(Drug dealers) certainly make use 
of the freedoms we have." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph P. Walsh Jr., who is prosecuting the Sylmar 
defendants, told jurors in his opening statement that "unimaginable quantities" 
of cocaine had been arriving at the warehouse for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
What the Sylmar cocaine operation underscored, according to government sources, 
is that Los Angeles has become the cocaine shipping center for the country. In 
years past, most of the drug was shipped to Miami from South America. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is the hub with the spokes going out," a government source said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the Sylmar raid, a top DEA official told Congress that the 
Colombian cartels are distributing huge amounts of cocaine through 
organizations that appear to be structured like legitimate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They manage all aspects of the cocaine supply chain, from cocaine cultivation 
and cocaine . . . production to security, from transportation and distribution 
to money laundering," said David Westrate, at the time the DEA's assistant 
administrator for operations. 
</P>
<P>
"As in a legitimate business structure, the . . . cartels have investors, 
bankers, lawyers, logistics experts, exporters, importers, chemists, 
wholesalers and retailers," he added. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutor Walsh's presentation to jurors, the Sylmar raid netted 
ledgers and notebooks that could provide intelligence on the cartels' 
organization. The agency has declined to comment on the value of the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the work of law enforcement is the fact that many of the Colombian 
kingpins and their underlings vanished after the Sylmar raid. "They disappeared 
like cockroaches into the night," a federal investigator lamented.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER RECOVERS HIS OWN STOLEN PICKUP 
</P>

<P>
A California Highway Patrol officer whose customized pickup truck was stolen 
from his home more than a year ago recovered his cherished vehicle after 
spotting it on a freeway, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Raul Munoz claimed his truck Thursday after he heard the familiar 
rumble of its engine and chased it down in the westbound lanes of the Artesia 
Freeway, CHP Officer Lyle Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz was clearing the scene of an accident on the freeway near the San Gabriel 
River Freeway in Cerritos about 1:30 p.m. when he heard the truck's engine and 
looked up to see a 1973 Chevrolet pickup just like his whizzing by, Whitten 
said. He caught up with the driver after a two-mile chase, and noticed details 
he had installed before it was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The driver had purchased the truck from someone else and was not arrested.

Photo, Rape Suspect Is Charged: Joseph Brian Socha, 28, was charged Friday in 
Long Beach Municipal Court with 18 counts of sexual assault, kidnaping and 
robbery. Long Beach police were searching for two women they said may have been 
additional victims. Socha, arrested this week in a rented room in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, is the man police believe is the so-called "Messenger of the Lord" 
rapist. He was charged with assaulting four women in Long Beach and San Pedro. 
Police said Socha used a gun to coerce his victims, and an eight-inch, 
double-edged knife to carve upside-down crosses on their backs. Socha's 
arraignment was postponed until Tuesday and he is being held at the Los Angeles 
County Jail hospital without bail, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Cosper said. LARRY

RESIGNATION OVER SENTENCING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tough new sentencing guidelines aren't dehumanizing; exactly the opposite, 
they hold some promise that criminals pay dearly with hard time behind bars, 
providing a small measure of hope the rest of us might live a more human (read: 
secure) existence. 
</P>
<P>
I believe there are many like myself who hope President Bush will replace Judge 
Irving with a fair-minded, energetic judge who will have no problem with tough 
sentencing, with luck, one who will also have "fun" doing so.

we are perfectly willing to gas them, electrocute them or lethally inject them

RESIGNATION OVER SENTENCING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the story about the resignation of U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving 
(Part A, Sept. 27) the reason Irving gave for his resignation was his 
dissatisfaction with the federal sentencing guidelines that restricted his 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
The new federal sentencing requirements were made into law in 1987. The law was 
designed to provide set standards for sentencing based on a point system. The 
gist of it is, it leaves judges little or no discretion in deciding on a 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The law was written and passed by our federal government for a reason. The 
reason could only be what seems logical, to prevent abuses by judges in 
sentencing criminals. The abuses were present on both ends of the spectrum. 
Some judges were unduly harsh with certain offenders, that is, sentences for 
the same or similar crimes could differ greatly depending on a variety of 
factors from the defendant's past history, to the judge's mood that day, to 
where the trial was held. 
</P>
<P>
The abuse at the other end of the spectrum is what brought up my bile. Some 
defendants received sentences that were far too lenient in relation to the 
crimes committed, again because of past history and often because the judges 
identified too closely with the criminals before them. 
</P>
<P>
I read with astonishment the paragraph where Irving commented on the Richard 
Silberman case. He said he would have liked to impose a lesser sentence on 
Silberman, taking into account his past contributions to the community. What? 
</P>
<P>
This is the same garbage we are hearing about Michael Milkin. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, these people made contributions to the community, all with other people's 
money; people who could ill afford the excessive community spirit of these 
false philanthropists they trusted with their life's savings. 
</P>
<P>
My last point would be that I think Irving is irked because of an age-old 
conflict, that is, who shall have the power. Judges wield enormous power in 
their world and I have never understood why. By creating these sentencing 
guidelines, a significant amount of power was pried from the judge's grasp.

U.S. STAND ON U.N. CONVENTION FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am gratified that the L.A. City Council showed its vision and compassion for 
the children of Los Angeles when it unanimously approved the bill of rights for 
children (Metro, Oct. 4). From now on, when the City Council and agencies 
consider creating and amending policies and laws, they are obligated to 
consider the impact on shelter, education and other basic needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's vote was just three days after the U.N. World Summit for 
Children. Notwithstanding the question of executing minors, children have no 
political or legal power of their own. The convention helps protect children 
from abuse and supports their rights to survival needs. President Bush should 
sign the convention and work for its passage.

THE ANATOMY OF A DEBACLE; 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING FOR REELECTION AND AWAY FROM REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many years ago, an east coast newspaperman wrote that the only way to look on a 
politician is down. Until Thursday, that seemed a harsh and sweeping judgment. 
</P>
<P>
But 57% of the members of the House of Representatives actually made it seem 
quite tame when they blithely chose to gamble with the nation's future rather 
than chance exposure to angry voters next month. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Thursday's rejection of a deficit-cutting plan put together in four 
months of shirt-sleeve negotiations between the White House and congressional 
leaders reflected what members were hearing from voters. 
</P>
<P>
In a torrent of telephone calls, the people at home told members and their 
staffs that they did not want to pay more for Medicare, pay higher gasoline 
taxes or absorb any of the other cuts in spending and increases in taxes 
proposed by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a vast majority of American voters also insist that the U.S. government has 
lived beyond its means for far too long and must stop adding to a national debt 
that is already $3,206,100,000,000, as in trillion. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Constitution envisioned a government in which representatives 
would represent the interests of the people who sent them to Washington and not 
the interests of their own political careers. 
</P>
<P>
There is virtually no argument among economists that a reduction of the 
deficit, with a good chance that interest rates would follow suit, is in the 
real interest of everybody. 
</P>
<P>
The package that the House rejected by a vote of 249 to 179 is far from 
perfect. It puts too big a burden on the poor and lets the wealthy off too 
lightly. About 6 million of the 33 million Americans who depend on Social 
Security and Medicare would have real trouble scraping together higher 
contributions toward their health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House would have nothing to do with any increase in, say, income 
tax rates (especially at the highest levels) that would spread the tax burden 
more evenly, so Congress had to negotiate the best alternative it could. 
</P>
<P>
The package was exactly as the House leadership described it -- the best it 
could get, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
The task at hand, after all, was cutting the rate at which the federal 
government goes into debt every year, not rewriting the tax code. Restoring 
fairness to the tax structure with a return to the principle of progressiveness 
is another task that can be tackled at another time. 
</P>
<P>
It also is fair to say that only because President Bush put his own popularity 
on the line by reversing his "Read my lips" campaign stand against higher taxes 
did Congress have anything at all on which to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Not even a warning from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve board 
of governors, that failure to cut the deficit could tip the economy into 
recession was enough to tear the thoughts of 249 members away from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of retaliation at the polls was not the sole cause of their craven 
behavior Thursday. The plan might even have squeaked through except for an 
unholy alliance of liberals and conservatives, each rejecting the plan for 
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 105 Republicans who voted against the plan seem to believe that 
cutting taxes speeds up business enough to increase government revenue and 
raising them has the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
Many no votes were cast by Democratic liberals, saying that taxes should be 
based on the ability to pay and that the federal government should be 
increasing, not cutting, domestic social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Hemingway described courage as "grace under pressure." What the nation 
saw Thursday was disgrace under pressure, with thoroughly wretched implications 
for a country whose financial foundation must be solid if it is to compete as a 
world leader in a global economy.

A VERDICT AGAINST THE CULTURE COPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight ordinary citizens of Cincinnati have used the keen edge of common sense 
to cut through the Gordian knot of our fitful and convoluted national debate 
over art and obscenity. By acquitting their city's Contemporary Arts Center and 
its director of charges they violated obscenity laws by exhibiting photographs 
by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, they have sent a clear signal that there are 
decisions a free people have no wish to delegate to the hovering officers of a 
protective state. 
</P>
<P>
One of those decisions is what does -- and does not -- constitute art. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the Cincinnati signal is sure to be amplified by the fact that 
no other major city in America has taken so unyielding a stand against 
commercial pornography. You cannot rent an X-rated videotape in Cincinnati or 
see a so-called adult magazine displayed at your local newsstand. However, you 
can -- if you so choose -- go into an art museum and see whatever you deem 
worth the time and effort. That distinction -- with all its high seriousness -- 
was drawn by four men and four women, none of whom had joined the 30,000 other 
Cincinnatians who saw the Mapplethorpe exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
In its waning days, the trial seemed to shape up as a sort of battle of the 
experts. The defense called to the stand a string of art museum professionals 
with unassailable academic credentials, all of whom testified to the aesthetic 
importance and validity of the deceased photographer's work. Critics of their 
position would hold, of course, that they are precisely the sort of cultural 
mandarins who have sacrificed social morality to self-indulgent abstraction. On 
the other hand, the record number of Americans who fill our art museums and 
galleries each year are themselves testimony to the fact that some significant 
number of us are willing to share their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's expert witness was a "communications specialist" whose 
services are regularly employed by large evangelical Christian organizations. 
She testified that Mapplethorpe's photographs were not art because they 
suffered from an "absence of human emotion." She argued further that the 
pictures he took of partially clad children -- with their parents' permission 
-- were child pornography because the youngsters' genitalia were exposed. 
Defense attorneys attacked her testimony because her own artistic career 
consisted of a stint as a songwriter for Captain Kangaroo and 30 hours of 
formal art education. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a profound mistake to construe the Cincinnati verdict as a choice 
between these experts and their values. Rather, it is an emphatic insistence on 
the right of every American to make distinctions for themselves according to 
their own taste and conscience.

BOEING WORK FORCE IN PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to clarify several issues raised by your Sept. 11 story on 
Boeing's B-2 work force in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Your story focused on approximately 450 Boeing workers from Seattle on 
temporary assignment in Palmdale, questioning the strength of Boeing's efforts 
to hire locally -- as well as the extra expense that such a practice might add 
to the B-2 program as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
To expand on the facts outlined in your story, Boeing currently has 866 
employees working in Palmdale in support of Northrop's B-2 final assembly. Of 
these, 415 were hired locally or permanently transferred to the area. 
</P>
<P>
We agree that we should hire a local work force to meet our needs to the 
maximum extent possible. In the last year and a half, 11 recruiting sessions 
for hourly and salaried workers for the B-2 program have been held in Palmdale 
and the greater Los Angeles area (Boeing also recruits extensively in Southern 
California for openings throughout the company). 
</P>
<P>
Advertisements for B-2 Palmdale have appeared in the Antelope Valley, Los 
Angeles, Orange County and San Bernardino newspapers. Despite these aggressive 
efforts, we could not hire all the people we needed with the specific skills 
required. We also increased our wage scale. 
</P>
<P>
As to the cost factor in using temporary workers, there is no advantage to 
Boeing; in fact, to the contrary, added cost reduces any profit we may earn. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing -- despite the fact that we are headquartered in Seattle -- has a very 
positive impact on the Southern California economy. Last year, Boeing purchased 
about $2 billion in products and services from companies in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. About half of our 120 key B-2 suppliers are located in your 
area, and Boeing contracts with more than 900 suppliers in the Los Angeles 
Basin. To give just one example, Northrop's local work for Boeing on the 747 
fuselage is directly responsible for 2,700 jobs in your local economy.

JAPAN'S LAND PRICE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My name was attached to the Sept. 26 Op-Ed article "Japan's Big Bubble Is Sure 
to Burst." Because it does not accurately represent my view on the subject, I 
would like to clarify my position. 
</P>
<P>
First, I don't agree that a land price crash in Japan is an economic 
inevitability. The Japanese system has numerous ways to deal with tough 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Second, my primary interest is in the political consequences of the land price 
hike and why the increasing wealth disparity in Japan due to skyrocketing land 
prices has not become a great political liability for the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP). The reason no political party has yet been (or will soon be) able 
to capitalize on the expensive-land problem is that the LDP manages to reduce 
the salience of issues at election time. 
</P>
<P>
For the LDP to maintain a majority in the lower house, LDP candidates have to 
compete against each other in most electoral districts. As a result, the LDP 
cannot run a national campaign on the basis of a party platform. Each LDP 
member must instead develop a personal following on the basis of services -- 
budgetary searches, sake bottles at local festivals, etc. In addition, the 
opposition parties are not well positioned to take advantage of the LDP's 
exposure on the land issue. The Socialists are trying to make inroads into the 
agricultural vote, which weakens their resolve to push for radical solutions 
that hurt land-rich farmers. The Democratic Socialists rely substantially on 
the small business vote, a group that also owns land and hence benefits from 
high land prices. The Communist Party is regarded as too far on the fringe on 
most issues for most voters, even if a growing number of voters appreciates the 
party's support for the asset-less groups in society. Similarly, the Komeito, 
which ostensibly represents non-unionized urban voters, is too closely 
associated with the zealous Soka Gakkai sect of Nichiren Buddhism to appeal to 
a much wider electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Only now as demographics increasingly favor difficult-to-organize urban voters, 
as big business supporters are increasingly dissatisfied with the expense of 
the system and as U.S. anger about Japanese protectionism is on the rise is the 
LDP seriously contemplating ditching this pork-for-votes electoral system. But 
even if the LDP adopts a new electoral system that features a more economical 
inter-party competition on the basis of party platforms, it will take some time 
for the opposition parties to recalibrate their strategies. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the LDP still lacks sharp electoral competition from other parties, 
partly due to its savvy adaptation to the electoral system and partly because 
of the organizational lassitude of the opposition. So I expect the LDP to 
muddle through with this problem, as it has in the past.

REFORMS AND REAPPORTIONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Schier's Sept. 26 commentary "Reforms That Aren't" is patronizing and 
contradictory. Schier asserts that "elite interest groups and politicians 
dominating the debate on campaign reform have forgotten the circumstances of 
the average voter." 
</P>
<P>
While purporting to understand the lives and political behavior of every 
American, Schier falls into his own trap. In his view, Americans are 
simple-minded idiots who will abandon the voting booth unless politics are 
packaged and fed to them as television entertainment. Who is elitist? 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Schier says "prim reformers" are attempting to make politics 
boring by calling for a "serious discussion of the issues." On the other, he 
suggests that campaigns should address the reality of people's lives. Call me 
prim, but any discussion of real problems as well as the complexities of 
solving them has to get serious. 
</P>
<P>
Schier further contradicted himself by calling for reform, while trashing 
proposals that are designed to address the very problems he identifies. I would 
suggest he walk his ideas through the legislative process. His views might be 
more credible were they subjected to the sharply partisan environment and 
debate that is inherent in creating any kind of change, regardless of its 
merits, in the conduct and financing of political campaigns.

HUGE COCAINE SEIZURE AT BORDER CROSSING A RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A TWO-NATION MANHUNT FOR THE DRIVER OF THE TANKER TRUCK, WHO HAD BEEN 
RELEASED PRIOR TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE DRUGS, IS CONDUCTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal authorities, having completed the unloading of almost 4 tons of cocaine 
discovered this week in a propane tanker truck en route from Mexico, on Friday 
declared it the largest cocaine seizure ever along a U.S. land border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,702-pound haul -- with an estimated street value of $262.5 million -- is 
believed to be the second-largest ever seized in California. A mammoth cache of 
21 tons (42,000 pounds) was discovered last year in the San Fernando Valley 
community of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The Sylmar load had been smuggled into the United States from the El Paso, 
Tex., border area, a fact that experts say underscores the border's role as a 
conduit for illicit substances headed for the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Mexican officials were conducting a two-nation manhunt Friday for the 
truck driver, who was allowed to leave the Otay Mesa inspection station area 
when customs officials were unable to readily determine whether drugs were 
inside the suspicious truck. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, a Mexican whose name was not released, was detained for at least 
eight hours before he was allowed to go free Wednesday afternoon, Customs 
officials said. Despite the ongoing search of his vehicle, authorities said 
that there was no legal basis to detain the man any longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't hold someone indefinitely at the border," said Thomas W. Hardy, 
acting district director for the U.S. Customs Service in San Diego. "I can't 
say there was an error; we're looking into that." 
</P>
<P>
The search to discover the drugs dragged on for almost 1 1/2 days, authorities 
said. Inspectors first took apart the truck's 18 tires and later bled excess 
propane, which is highly volatile, from the tank. Investigators did not 
discover the cocaine until 2:30 p.m. Thursday -- about 24 hours after the 
driver had been permitted to leave and some 32 hours after the vehicle had 
initially pulled into the border entry. The drugs were finally all unloaded at 
4 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors first became suspicious, officials said, when narcotics-sniffing 
dogs stationed at the facility paid attention to the vehicle's tires, 
indicating that there might be drugs concealed in the wheels. After weighing, 
it was determined that the truck, which was supposedly empty, weighed more than 
it should. Authorities said there was no advance information that the vehicle 
might be ferrying contraband. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs were wrapped in 3,501 packages, or bricks, each weighing about 1 
kilogram, or 2.2 pounds. Among the wrappings used, authorities said, was a 
newspaper from Medellin, Colombia, base of the legendary drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials would not comment when asked about the likely destination of the 
cocaine. The substance was probably loaded onto the truck in Mexico, within 
five miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, said Ron D'Ulisse, spokesman in San Diego 
for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The bust, officials said, illustrates the wide use that international 
traffickers are making of the U.S.-Mexico land border, which stretches for 
almost 2,000 miles from Texas to California. Mexico has long been a major 
transshipment point for South American cocaine, as well as a primary source of 
heroin, marijuana and other illicit substances favored by U.S. users. 
</P>
<P>
Smugglers utilize both the vast unguarded spaces between border entries and 
attempt to sneak drugs in vehicles through the ports, hoping that understaffed 
inspection teams will not search their cargoes. Tens of thousands of cars and 
trucks enter the United States each day from Mexico, a fact that makes its 
impossible to search each vehicle. Tanker trucks frequently have been used to 
ferry marijuana and other illicit substances. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the traffickers) never stop being innovative," said Julius Beretta, 
special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San 
Diego. "Something like this leads you to wonder how many times it has happened 
(before). We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 589,000 trucks -- more than 1,613 per day -- entered the United 
States at the Otay Mesa crossing, which is about 8 miles east of the larger, 
non-commercial port at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The white tanker truck ferrying the cocaine normally carries propane gas for 
Hidro Gas Juarez, a firm in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Executives of the firm could 
not be contacted Friday by The Times. U.S. authorities said that the firm was 
cooperating in the investigation. U.S.-produced propane is regularly shipped in 
such tanker trucks to Mexico, where it is widely used for cooking and heating. 
</P>
<P>
The company has had related problems before, a customs official said. In 1985, 
said Bobbie Cassidy, a customs spokeswoman in San Diego, inspectors discovered 
two separate loads of marijuana -- 80 pounds and 55 pounds -- in the tires of 
two Hidro Gas Juarez trucks. She could not say if any prosecutions resulted 
from those seizures. 
</P>
<P>
The most cocaine seized at a U.S. land border before this is believed to have 
been 3,589 pounds near El Paso in September, 1987, said John Miller, a customs 
spokesman in Los Angeles. The largest San Diego seizure before this was 1,920 
pounds in 1988 from a truck at the Otay Mesa port, authorities said.

MAN HELD IN HOSPITAL SHOOTINGS HANGS SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bradford Powers Jr., accused of killing two people and shooting two others in 
the emergency room of Mission Bay Hospital, was found Friday hanging from a bed 
sheet tied to the bars of his jail cell in what authorities called an attempted 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Powers, who many years ago was reported to have mental problems, was taken to 
San Diego General Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition in the 
intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Glenn Revell said Powers was being held in a one-man cell on the 
fourth floor of the County Jail downtown when a deputy making a routine check 
found him unconscious at about 3 a.m., hanging by his jail-issued bed sheet. A 
deputy had last checked the cell at 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Powers had been moved to the single cell shortly after 11 p.m. Thursday, after 
complaining to a supervising deputy that his life was in danger if he stayed in 
his second-floor group-holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said Powers was "either unable or unwilling" to say why he was scared. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours earlier, at about 5:15 p.m. Thursday, Powers was seen by 
psychiatric security personnel, though the reason for that visit was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
After he was found hanging, deputies and jail medical personnel began 
life-saving procedures, including giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
oxygen, though they were unable to detect a pulse or any breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics arrived about 3:15 a.m. and they were able to detect a pulse, Revell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers was then taken to the hospital, where nursing supervisor James Marx said 
he was in critical condition and under police guard. 
</P>
<P>
Powers was being held on two counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder 
and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon as a result of his rampage 
through Mission Bay Hospital's emergency room on April 14. His bail was set at 
$2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Powers, 46, who lived in La Jolla with his father, Brad Powers Sr., 75, was 
distraught over the death of his father at the hospital a few hours earlier. 
The elder Powers, a well-known illustrator with a history of health problems, 
had been taken to the emergency room complaining of severe abdominal pain. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing an abdominal aneurysm, doctors decided on surgery after consulting with 
the younger Powers. But the elder Powers died on the operating table. 
</P>
<P>
About eight hours later on a Saturday afternoon, a distraught younger Powers 
returned to the emergency room with a .22-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
He confronted two nurses at a desk and screamed, "You killed my father!" 
</P>
<P>
Powers shot and killed one of the nurses, Deborah Kay Burke, 36. He walked 
through the room and killed Edward Rooney, 30, who was on the first day of his 
job training as an emergency room technician. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency room doctor, Michael Hughes, was wounded, as was Fred Mowrer, a 
38-year-old attorney from Albuquerque, N.M. Vacationing with his family in San 
Diego, Mowrer had taken his 2-year-old daughter to the hospital for medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In a jailhouse interview with The Times two weeks after the shootings, Powers 
admitted he shot the people and felt bad about it, "but my defense is based on 
the facts of what brought me to that point." 
</P>
<P>
"The hospital, they were the most negligent. It's criminal negligence, to me, 
what they did to my father. And, if they hadn't been negligent, then this whole 
tragedy could have been avoided," said Powers, adding that something "snapped" 
after his father died. He said he went home, drank 1 1/2 quarts of vodka and 
then went back to the hospital with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Powers has had psychiatric problems dating back at least 25 years, when his 
father went to court to have him examined for mental illness because he was 
"very hyperactive" and "on the verge of violence." But the elder Powers 
withdrew his petition five days after he filed the request.

SHARP NOW SEEKS GROSSMONT MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: SPURNED BY SCRIPPS CLINIC, ORGANIZATION HAS BEGUN TALKS IN HOPES 
OF JOINING UP WITH HOSPITAL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Grossmont Hospital District and Sharp HealthCare began formal talks on joining 
forces Friday, marking another chapter in hospital merger-mania in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came exactly 10 weeks after Scripps Clinic stunned Sharp by 
deciding to unify with Scripps Memorial Hospitals after long negotiations with 
Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement from Grossmont Friday afternoon alluded to that turnabout. 
"Neither institution will be discussing affiliation possibilities with other 
organizations as these discussions proceed," it said. 
</P>
<P>
However, unlike in previous merger talks, Grossmont officials were more 
forthcoming about details. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a district hospital, and we feel that as a district hospital we have a 
responsibility to the public to let them know what we're doing," said 
Grossmont's communications director, Cheryl Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
She said the hospital issued the announcement as soon as the discussions with 
Sharp became serious, she said. She stressed that no decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick speculated freely, for instance, about how Grossmont -- a district 
hospital that receives tax revenues from its East County district -- might be 
able to unify with a non-district organization such as Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish a merger, a separate corporation could be formed to lease 
Grossmont Hospital from the hospital district, she said. It would be the 
corporation, then, not the district, that would be affiliating with Sharp 
HealthCare, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp is a large nonprofit health care conglomerate with hospitals and other 
facilities stretching from Temecula to Chula Vista. Its flagship facility is 
Sharp Memorial Hospital near Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Although Grossmont in La Mesa has only one hospital, it is a dominant one in 
eastern San Diego County, where Sharp hasn't had a toehold. Consequently, a 
merger would not result in overlaps between the two systems. 
</P>
<P>
Affiliation between the two organizations also makes sense in the competitive 
marketplace of the past decade, during which hospitals garnered much of their 
patient load through managed-care contracts with insurers or large employers. 
Having that broad geographic coverage makes a hospital system more attractive 
to these big customers. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Keast, vice president for member services of the California Assn. of 
Hospitals, said the mergers of large institutions with one another is a San 
Diego twist on a statewide phenomenon. Elsewhere, mergers have mostly been 
between two small hospitals that join forces to avoid duplication of services. 
One small hospital might retain acute care while the other becomes a 
rehabilitation hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Sharp and Grossmont, however, that kind of specialization would 
be unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Grossmont recently completed a new women's center and Sharp Memorial is 
building one; both would remain. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be one combined organization with two great women's centers in two 
different locations," said Jan Frates, a health care consultant in San Diego. 
"I think it's going to be a real powerful combination." 
</P>
<P>
Frates and others predicted that the merger trend will continue in San Diego 
because of the highly competitive health care marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"There's strength in numbers, and it's also a typical pattern in business," 
Frates said. "It's following banking and airlines: you have deregulation, you 
have intense competition and then, as part of the industry shakeout, 
consolidations occur." 
</P>
<P>
Sharp was surprised to learn July 27 that a year of merger talks with Scripps 
Clinic had been undercut by whirlwind, secret discussions between the clinic 
and Scripps Memorial Hospitals. They will merge on Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont's Kendrick said the hospital had been talking informally recently 
with several other organizations about merging, but those discussions are 
suspended now.

A BLESSED EVENT FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR PETS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: ABOUT 20 ANIMALS ARE ANOINTED IN THE BACK YARD OF A SCHOOL. IT 
MARKS THE 764TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI.

There were dogs and cats and parakeets. And a wild pigeon and a tortoise. And a 
field rat and a goat and one stuffed teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
In all there were about 20 animals Friday in the back yard of a Santa Paula 
elementary school, and each was there to be blessed. 
</P>
<P>
Father Roberto Feguero, a Franciscan priest, stood solemnly on a podium in 
front of a collage put together by the seventh-graders. The collage depicted 
barefooted St. Francis of Assisi -- with his beard and halo and monk's robe -- 
smiling at pink horses, yellow bulls and red parrots. 
</P>
<P>
The real animals were in cages, boxes, on tight leashes and in their masters' 
arms. The children were very quiet and were not distracted, their eyes fixed on 
the podium. The mothers and grandparents standing nearby looked at their 
children and smiled. Father Roberto was holding an open Bible. 
</P>
<P>
The boys and girls had learned at Santa Barbara Catholic School in Santa Paula 
that St. Francis, who loved all animals, had gone to heaven many years ago. 
Friday they celebrated the 764th anniversary of that occasion with a blessing 
of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to incorporate as many Catholic traditions as possible, and this is a 
fun one," said seventh-grade teacher Regina Stehly, who helped organize the 
blessing, the first since the school opened three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially today, we need to have a greater appreciation of the gift of 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
Father Roberto looked at the flock gathered about him and nodded approvingly. 
Then he looked down at his Bible, turned a page and started reciting in 
Spanish: 
</P>
<P>
"Blessed are all the little animals that our Your creation. For them we give 
You thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Stehly, who was standing next to the priest, offered a similar blessing in 
English. Then she asked the youngsters to form a line with their animals so the 
anointing could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Father Roberto pulled a sprinkler from a bronze bucket and proceeded to spray 
the animals and the children's sleeves with drops of Holy Water. 
</P>
<P>
In less than 15 minutes, the ceremony was over and the children dispersed. 
</P>

Vicente Guerrero, 8, was the last one to leave. He was crouched near the 
podium, looking into a bird cage that was shared by Vicente's gray pigeon and 
his little brown rat with the long white tail, neither of which had names. 
</P>
<P>
Vicente's eyes were big and moist. 
</P>
<P>
"I had them blessed so that nothing happens to them," he whispered. "I brought 
them so they can live forever."

FESTIVAL ORGANIZERS SCHEDULE FORUM

<P>
Organizers of the Ojai Festival, eager to mend fences with their neighbors 
after years of uneasy coexistence, have scheduled a public forum for Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kemper, president of the annual festival's board of directors, said the 
meeting will be held to solicit comments from Ojai-area residents and 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, local critics have complained that the three-day summer event 
concentrates on music that appeals to only a few listeners, largely overlooks 
the surrounding community and caters almost exclusively to out-of-town 
visitors. Festival officials face an unprecedented deficit of nearly $100,000 
after this summer's event. 
</P>
<P>
The forum is scheduled for 7:30 a.m. in the Ojai Playhouse. Christopher Hunt, 
recently hired as consulting director of the festival, is expected to lead the 
discussion. CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS

GAS COSTS PUT PINCH ON BUSES, CABS 
</P>

Rising fuel prices have turned out to be a double-edged sword for local public 
transit agencies: more cost-conscious people are using public transportation 
since the Middle East crisis began, but increased passenger revenues are being 
eaten up by higher fuel costs, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Our drivers tell us there has been an increase in express ridership, which 
could lead us to believe that people who have alternatives are choosing not to 
pay the higher gas prices," said Rich Murphy, vice president of operations for 
San Diego Transit Corp., which operates about 300 buses. 
</P>
<P>
"More riders are always good for public transit," said Carmen Sandoval, another 
San Diego Transit official. "But higher fuel costs may force us to retune our 
fuel budget if the crisis continues." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Transit budgeted diesel fuel costs at 68 cents per gallon when the 
fiscal year began July 1. The agency's buses burn about 8,000 gallons of fuel 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
In July, transit officials were paying 50 cents a gallon for diesel, Sandoval 
said. The cost rose to 95 cents a gallon in August, and the agency has recently 
been paying 85 cents, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, like other transit officials, said gasoline prices went up dramatically 
in September and guessed that the more significant passenger increases occurred 
then. San Diego Transit's September passenger figures will not be available 
until later this month, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Langley Powell, president and general manager of San Diego Trolley, said 
trolley energy costs have gone up by 33% as of September. However, he 
attributed most of the energy costs, primarily for electricity to power the 
trolley, to expanded services and the installation of air conditioning in all 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ratepayers like anyone else. We don't have any special privileges. But 
it would be pretty difficult to analyze how much of the new costs are due to 
higher energy costs," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Trolley ridership is also up. Powell said the number of passengers riding the 
trolley in August increased by 16% from August, 1989. Much of the rider 
increase is due to East County extension and the opening of the Bay Side line. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had an increase in ridership every month for the past eight years. I 
think we would've had this recent increase with or without the rising gas 
prices," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, some cab companies and one airport shuttle service have 
increased fares. Metropolitan Transportation Development Board officials said 
that 15 firms, which operate about 6% of San Diego's taxi fleet, have raised 
fares to $1.80 per mile, the maximum allowed by the board. 
</P>
<P>
Super Shuttle officials, who have seen their fuel costs go up 24% in the past 
two months, implemented a 50-cent fuel surcharge per passenger -- on top of the 
average fare of $11 per person -- on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have resisted raising fares for fear of losing passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're competing with the shuttle companies and other cabs. I've had several 
drivers say they would rather eat the increased costs than pass them on to our 
customers. We don't want to price ourselves out of the market," said Yellow Cab 
official Anthony Palmeri. 
</P>
<P>
While Super Shuttle, the biggest shuttle service in the county, chose to 
increase fares, other shuttle companies are still standing fast. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Skye, a manager at Coast Shuttle, said his company is paying $2,000 more 
a month for fuel compared to July, but "we're not thinking of implementing a 
fuel surcharge." 
</P>
<P>
Coast's fares are slightly higher than those charged by other shuttle 
companies. The company charges $16 for two persons for a trip from La Jolla to 
the airport and $44 for a family of four from Escondido to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We went round and round on this, whether to do it or not. In the end, we had 
to implement a fuel surcharge," said Roselyn Smith, Super Shuttle's vice 
president of communications. "Our cost for fuel went up about 24% in less than 
60 days. We're forced to buy at the pump, like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, the company had budgeted 12% of its gross revenue for fuel 
costs. Currently, gasoline expenses account for between 18% and 20% of the 
company's gross revenues, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Super Shuttle officials said their riders have increased from about 1,000 a day 
in July to about 1,200 riders per day in September. Smith attributed the 
increase in part to drivers who are trying to conserve gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's still not enough to offset our fuel bill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Local cab companies say they have generally not benefitted from the gas crisis 
and cab drivers are being hit hard in the pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
"The gas companies will use any excuse to raise gas prices. What's going to 
happen if they really start shooting over there?" said Alfred Hueso, an owner 
of the family run USA Cab. 
</P>
<P>
MTDB officials said about 95% of San Diego's cabs are leased to drivers by cab 
owners. Lease drivers are required to pay for most of the cab's operating 
costs, including gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hueso, his company's drivers are paying about $100 a month more 
for gasoline, for an average of $350, since gas prices went up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awful. The gas bill keeps going up but we haven't necessarily seen an 
increase in passengers. . . . We thought this crisis was going to be temporary, 
but things aren't cooling down. It might get worse," Hueso said. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Cab's Palmeri said he is having trouble attracting lease drives because 
of the higher fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed a decrease in the number of drivers who want to lease from us," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Cab buys gasoline from a distributor and turns around and sells it to 
its drivers. The company has been "eating a nickel a gallon" in the price it 
charges drivers, Palmeri added.

Teams of locals including the Chowderettes, the Cape Clods, and Captain Lee and 
his Mates will compete in this morning's Chowder Cook-off at Channel Islands 
Harbor. The competition is part of this weekend's Maritime Days celebration of 
the 25th anniversary of the harbor's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual cook-off, which begins at 10 a.m., is a fierce competition in 
which teams dress in costumes and loudly insult their competitors, said Sharon 
Gable, spokeswoman for the Harbor Assn. of Lessees, sponsor of the festival. 
Winners will be announced at noon.

<P>
During a heated debate that will be televised Saturday, Oxnard Mayor Nao 
Takasugi was accused by five other mayoral candidates of everything from giving 
developers sweetheart deals to failing to bring more affordable housing to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi calmly defended his record during the first political forum before the 
Nov. 6 elections. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, called the Blue Ribbon Election Special, took place Thursday in the 
studios of KADY-TV in Oxnard and will be aired Saturday at 11:30 a.m. on 
Channel 36. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates in the forum were four-term incumbent Takasugi; Scott Bollinger, 
a private investor; John Cobian, who operates an interpreting service; Deborah 
DeMoss, a homemaker; Councilwoman Dorothy Maron; and John Soria, who runs a 
small consulting company with his wife. HUGO MARTIN

D.A. EXPECTS DEATH PENALTY TO BE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury predicted Friday that the 
California Supreme Court will uphold the death penalty for Theodore Frank, who 
was convicted in the 1978 rape and torture-murder of a 2-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said after sitting through oral arguments before the Supreme Court 
Thursday, "My hunch is, judging from the comments of the justices, they'll 
uphold it . . . It was a flawless trial. The defense is just scraping to find 
an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Frank, now 55, was sentenced twice to the gas chamber for molesting and 
murdering Amy Sue Seitz of Camarillo. The second death sentence came in 1987 
after the high court overturned the first one in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, state Deputy Public Defender Stephen Matchett argued to the 
Supreme Court that the trial judge at Frank's second sentencing had improperly 
considered statements by the victim's grandmother, Patricia A. Linebaugh. 
Matchett said Linebaugh's statements asking Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan 
to sentence Frank to death contained "implied threats" that he could be voted 
out of office if he changed the jury verdict from death to life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Matchett declined Friday to discuss his predictions on how the Supreme Court 
will rule on Frank's sentence. "I would decline to speculate on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The high court has 90 days from Thursday's hearing in which to make its ruling.

Repairs "are going very well," said Jim Melton, spokesman for the San Diego 
County Water Authority, which provides water to most of the county. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's first Stage 4 alert remains in place, but with customers 
reducing their water consumption by up to two-thirds in some areas, all five 
water districts affected by the shortage decided to ease outdoor watering 
emergency restrictions from 5 p.m. Thursday to 8 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The lifting of mandatory restrictions allows residents to water their parched 
landscaping once between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. during the designated days. Use of 
sprinklers and watering of lawns is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Water authorities, however, urged residential and commercial customers not to 
go overboard. Outdoor watering is otherwise prohibited until the lifting of the 
Stage 4 alert. 
</P>
<P>
Water abusers face citations or the shut-off of their water, but this has not 
happened during the crisis, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Otay Water District originally did not ease its restrictions, saying the 
situation remained critical for its more than 100,000 customers, but announced 
Friday that it was joining the other four water districts in lifting the ban 
temporarily. Otay's residential customers with even-numbered addresses may 
water from 5 p.m. today to 8 a.m. Sunday and customers with odd-numbered 
addresses may water from 5 p.m. Sunday to 8 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The other affected districts are the Padre Dam Municipal Water District and 
Helix, Riverview and Lakeside water districts, which serve eastern areas of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaping of Otay Water District customers received some relief Thursday when 
eight water trucks covered the 128-square-mile area spraying water collected 
from neighboring water districts. Local construction companies donated the use 
of the trucks through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, San Diego County Water Authority crews finished welding 40 feet of 
replacement pipe into existing pipeline and began pouring concrete into the 
support frame surrounding the new pipe. 
</P>
<P>
The pouring of 80 yards of concrete will continue through today to create the 
1-yard-thick concrete shell that supports the steel pipeline. The pipe will 
carry about 70 million gallons daily. 
</P>
<P>
After the concrete shell has cured, the pipeline will be filled with water and 
pressurized, a process that takes nearly a day. Water service is to be restored 
Tuesday, but officials would not estimate the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
"That's no guarantee, but that's what we're planning," Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
East and South county residents have been relying on surplus water supplies and 
water from Lake Jennings in Lakeside since the Sept. 28 pipeline rupture.

Republican candidates for county and state offices will speak at a rally in 
Oxnard on Sunday to raise money for the party's Ventura County headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers expect to attract about 300 people in hopes of raising at least 
$7,500 for its main party headquarters in Camarillo and this year's campaign 
base in Oxnard, spokeswoman Jean Dewey said. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets cost $25 for the Western-style meal at the McGrath Ranch, 5011 W. 
Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
The annual rally, sponsored by the Ventura County Republican Party Central 
Committee, does not aim to promote individual candidates, although several will 
speak at the event between 1 and 5 p.m., Dewey said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Robert J. Lagomarsino

A 37-year-old woman whose nude body was found in a Westlake Village condominium 
was strangled, Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens reported Friday after an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County sheriff's investigators found Ellen Cleary's body Thursday 
afternoon in a bathtub in a small amount of water, Lt. Joe Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials do not know whether she was taking a bath or was placed there by the 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Velasco, 22, of Van Nuys told Los Angeles police that he killed his 
girlfriend and gave them details that led sheriff's deputies to Cleary's 
condominium in the 1100 block of Bright Glen Circle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Velasco's admission to the slaying, investigators have failed to find a 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel confident we know who perpetrated the crime. But why? It's not an easy 
question to answer," Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco told authorities that he had known Cleary for three years and that she 
was his girlfriend, Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $1 million. PSYCHE PASCUAL

FOES SAY MAILERS HELP INCUMBENTS; 
</P>
<P>
FRANKING: A STUDY SHOWS THAT REPS. GALLEGLY AND LAGOMARSINO SPENT $185,179 AND 
$121,457 IN 1989 ON WHAT A CHALLENGER CALLS SELF-AGGRANDIZEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic challengers on Friday accused Congressmen Elton Gallegly and Robert 
J. Lagomarsino of using taxpayer-supported mailers to strengthen their 1990 
reelection campaigns, and of being among the biggest spenders in the House of 
Representatives on newsletters to constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) spent $185,179 and Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) $121,457 on 
mass mailings in 1989, which ranked them fifth and 14th among California's 44 
House members in 1989, says a new study by a national taxpayers group. 
</P>
<P>
Citing that study and her own analysis of mailings this year, Anita Perez 
Ferguson said Friday that Lagomarsino has spent $289,000 over the last two 
years on mailers. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that this is basically self-aggrandizing junk mail," Ferguson, a 
former aide to state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), said after a Ventura 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Richard D. Freiman, an Agoura attorney and TV writer opposing Gallegly, said 
the incumbent's reported spending on five mass mailings in 1989 was a waste of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"These are puff pieces for Gallegly," he said. "Most people throw them out 
because they don't have any information that is important or necessary in 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy surrounding the so-called franking privilege, under which Congress 
spent more than $100 million last year on mailings, led to extensive reform in 
the U.S. Senate in 1989 and to lesser restrictions in the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Lagomarsino and Gallegly said the congressmen both supported 
those reforms, voting to reduce the number of mass mailings by House members 
from six to three a year beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino "would have supported eliminating them completely" if that had come 
to a vote, said John Doherty of the congressman's Washington staff. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino and Gallegly voted to limit the mail privilege -- a popular 
congressional benefit since 1793 -- even though both remain convinced that the 
newsletters are useful tools in communicating with constituents, their 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman believes it's an important way of keeping in touch with the 
district," said John Frith, Gallegly's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Frith and Doherty said surveys have shown repeatedly that residents of their 
districts like the newsletters and want them to continue. They said, however, 
that only about 10% to 15% of households in their districts respond to such 
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it's there and our constituents want to have it, we'll keep using 
it," Doherty said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of mass mailings by Gallegly and Lagomarsino, who represent the two 
congressional districts that overlap Ventura County, was reported late last 
month by the National Taxpayers Union, a 200,000-member nonprofit group that 
lobbies for reduced government spending. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pierce, spokesman for the group, said the study shows that the average 
expense by a congressman on newsletters in 1989 was 31 cents per household. By 
comparison, Lagomarsino spent 37 cents for each household in his district and 
Gallegly 71 cents, Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said the figures in his group's study are not precise, because the exact 
spending of House members on mass mailings are confidential. But most, 
including Gallegly and Lagomarsino, confirmed the number of mailings from their 
offices. A minimum figure was derived from that. 
</P>
<P>
Frith acknowledged that Gallegly sent five of the six mass mailings allowed in 
1989, as reported in the study. But he said it is somewhat flawed because it is 
not exact. 
</P>
<P>
Doherty said Lagomarsino did send three mass mailers in 1989, as reported in 
the study. But he challenged Ferguson's claim that the congressman had spent 
another $160,000 this year on six mass mailings. He said that Ferguson has no 
way of knowing how much Lagomarsino has spent and that he has sent out only 
three newsletters to all households in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Three additional mailings were sent out over the summer to thousands of people 
who have expressed concern about specific issues, he acknowledged.

<P>
The League of Women Voters of Ventura County has scheduled presentations this 
month to help voters confused by any of the 18 propositions on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"The pros and cons listed on the ballot are often written by legal people or 
legislative analysts," said Roma Armbrust, the league's county president. "Our 
speakers put the arguments in more easily understandable terms, and the public 
has an opportunity to ask questions." 
</P>
<P>
The first of the six pro-and-con sessions, which -- like the league's upcoming 
candidate forums -- are free to the public, is scheduled at the American Legion 
Hall in Ventura on Thursday at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other programs are scheduled at the Thousand Oaks Library, Oct. 22 at 7 p.m.; 
the Ojai Presbyterian Church, Oct. 23 at 9:30 a.m.; the United Methodist Church 
in Santa Paula, Oct. 24 at 7 p.m.; Ventura City Hall, Oct. 25 at 7:30 p.m.; and 
the Simi Valley Library, Oct. 26 at 7 p.m. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

SEIZED GUITARS ATTRACT COLLECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collector shouted "8,000" to the auctioneer, and Brent Haesler knew it was 
time to quit bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Haesler, an amateur guitarist from Palos Verdes, was prepared to spend up to 
$4,000 for a classic six-string but instead settled for a well-worn 1950 
acoustic that was easily within budget at $300. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this many collectible guitars in one location," said Haesler, 
36, whose modest collection includes a 1957 Gibson Les Paul. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 dealers, collectors and musicians from Washington to Japan 
converged on an Upland auction yard Thursday night to bid on 87 vintage guitars 
seized last year from a Thousand Oaks drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
When the bidding ended, United Auctions had taken in $112,850, and the 
anti-drug unit of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was $102,693.50 
richer, after deducting a 9% auctioneer's fee. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies seized the guitars, along with $76,155 in cash and a 1988 
Camaro, during a September, 1989, raid on the Potrero Road residence of William 
H. Budnik. 
</P>
<P>
Budnik argued that he paid legitimate money for the guitars, whose value he 
estimated at about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped the claim after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana for sale 
and serving several months of a one-year sentence in the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was held under an outdoor canopy with a jazz band accompanying 
registered bidders who wanted to test the guitars' sound quality. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Sullivan, 57, of Thousand Oaks satisfied a longtime desire when he 
walked away with a 1949 Gibson jazz guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who works in the electronics industry, said he has put off guitar 
studies for years because he lacked a finely crafted instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an affinity for Gibsons since I had one in college that I sold when 
money got tight," Sullivan said. "This scratches a longtime itch." 
</P>
<P>
Collector Mac Yasuda paid the top price of the night in shelling out $8,000 for 
a 1962 Fender Stratocaster, which was valued at $10,000. Several of the most 
expensive guitars sold below their appraised values, while many guitars worth 
$200 to $300 netted twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of happy buyers who walked away with bargains," said Bob Mohs of 
United Auctions. 
</P>
<P>
But, "There may be some purchases that people will be disappointed about once 
they come out from under the ether." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials suspected that Budnik might turn up to reclaim 
some of his most coveted pieces, but auction officials recorded no sales to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Thompson, the Sheriff Department's property custodian, said the onetime 
owner could only have gone away heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of guitars here he could never replace," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Doug Moran of United Auctions: "It would be tough for him to show up. Sort 
of like going to your girlfriend's wedding or being the bellhop on her 
honeymoon." CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

BOARD VOTES TO DEMAND ELY RETURN HIS DISTRICT BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite one trustee's concern that "it seems we're singling out a member who is 
not here," Ventura County Community College District trustees voted Friday 
night to demand the return of a district-owned fax machine, credit cards and 
other benefits from besieged Trustee James T. (Tom) Ely. 
</P>
<P>
With Ely absent, board members voted 4 to 0 to order that he return a fax 
machine, telephone answering machine, American Express card and telephone 
credit card. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they also voted to rescind their own such benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to accusations that Ely has been using the district-owned fax machine 
to attack prosecutors and district officials, Trustee Timothy Hirschberg said, 
"There is concern that the target of one of these fax messages may hold the 
district liable." 
</P>
<P>
But another trustee, Gregory Cole, who eventually supported the motion, 
reminded board members several times that Ely was not there to defend himself. 
"Tom is still a sitting trustee. He has not been convicted of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Ely and his wife, Ingrid, face trial on charges of conspiring to steal district 
funds by padding expense reports. On Tuesday, Ely's four fellow board members 
called for his resignation and voted to bill him the $16,768.32 that he 
allegedly overcharged the district. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ely's lawyer, James M. Farley, denounced the board's action, 
saying it "will appear to the public as if a government body is lending its 
sanction to the district attorney's allegations" against Ely. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview before the meeting, Ely said his fellow members "can 
have those things any time they want them."

BOY, 5, INJURED IN SHOOTING BY SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS

<P>
Suspected gang members shot and slightly injured a 5-year-old boy as he stood 
in front of a North Hollywood house with relatives, Los Angeles police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three suspects were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in the 5200 block of Harmony Avenue shortly after 8 p.m. 
Thursday night, Officer Jeff Godown said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was standing near the porch with several relatives when a gunman 
approached on foot and fired about three rounds of birdshot into the group, 
striking the child once in the hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was treated at the scene by paramedics and released. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman had argued with a member of the boy's family earlier 
that evening and was actually attempting to shoot him and not the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"The child wasn't the target," Godown said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers traced a car, found several blocks from the shooting scene, which was 
allegedly used in the gunman's escape. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a shotgun and arrested Jaime Ortiz, 21, and Carlos Morales, 
20, both of North Hollywood, and a 15-year-old on suspicion of attempted 
murder.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORT OF ARMED MAN LEADS TO EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies evacuated about 30 Santa Clarita 
residents Friday from an apartment complex the deputies believed was occupied 
by an armed man who had injured his wife and infant son. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Sheriff's Department special weapons team entered the complex in 
the 27500 block of Sierra Highway about four hours later, the man's apartment 
was empty, Deputy Mary Landreth said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind. These things happen. They've got to take all the precautions," 
said a resident of the three-story complex, who was evacuated but asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies Friday were still seeking one of the apartment residents, 
Anthony Vargas, 35, on suspicion of spousal abuse and child endangerment, 
Landreth said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN STRANGLED TO DEATH, CORONER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-year-old woman whose nude body was found in a Westlake condominium died of 
strangulation, Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens reported Friday after an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Velasco, 22, of Van Nuys told Los Angeles police that he killed his 
girlfriend and gave them details that led sheriff's deputies to Ellen Cleary's 
condominium in the 1100 block of Bright Glen Circle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County sheriff's investigators found Cleary's body Thursday afternoon 
in a bathtub in a small amount of water, Lt. Joe Harwell said. Officials do not 
know whether she was taking a bath or was placed there by the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no obvious signs of trauma, Cleary's neck bore a series of 
small cuts that may have been made by a kitchen knife found at the scene, 
Harwell said. The wounds did not contribute to her death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, however, do not know the motive. There were no signs of a 
violent struggle, Harwell said. Velasco was apparently a guest in the Cleary's 
home before the slaying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco told authorities he had known Cleary for three years and that she was 
his girlfriend, Harwell said. However, both of them also saw other people, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, a 1988 graduate of Independence High School in Van Nuys, sought the 
advice of a school office manager before turning himself in, Principal Cynthia 
Gladstone said. Velasco, like many graduates of the continuation high school, 
often comes back to visit and "he may have felt safe in coming here," Gladstone 
said.

An 18-year-old Van Nuys woman was sentenced Friday to state prison for at least 
11 years for her role in the murder of a Pacoima man who was gunned down as he 
sat in a car with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Argott, who police say is a gang member, was convicted by a Superior 
Court jury of second-degree murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Police said she drove the car Jan. 17 while her boyfriend, Walter Oswaldo 
Barillas, 22, fired at least 11 shots into the victim's car. 
</P>
<P>
Barillas remains at large, Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the gunfire was Odilon Gonzalez, 33. But police said the bullets 
missed Gonzalez's fiancee, Irma Ortega, 21, who apparently was saved because 
Gonzalez pushed her to the floor just before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels said Argott will remain in prison at least 11 years under the sentence 
of 16 years to life imposed by Judge Darlene E. Schempp.

In 1948, he opened an office in Van Nuys, where he practiced until his 
retirement in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of one year; sons John Nicholson of Canoga Park, and 
Dr. Stephen Nicholson of Bayfield, Colo.; daughter Phyllis Nicholson of Durham,

Simi Valley and Bruce Dobin of Cameron Park, Calif.; stepdaughter Gail Jones of 
Simi Valley; brother Dr. Homer Nicholson of Woodland Hills; four grandchildren; 
and eight step-grandchildren. 
</P>

YAROSLAVSKY TO SEEK 2-STORY HEIGHT LIMIT IN SHERMAN OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky will seek to bar new construction 
from exceeding two stories in height along an eight-block stretch of Ventura 
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, his office announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it goes against the character of Sherman Oaks to have construction of 
buildings any higher than two stories," Yaroslavsky said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would impose a two-story or 30-foot height restriction on Ventura 
Boulevard from Columbus Avenue to Beverly Glen Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Roscalvo, a Yaroslavsky planning aide, said the proposed ordinance 
probably would not take effect for another six months and would eventually 
amend the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, which is still under consideration 
by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the delay, "no projects are in the pipeline that pose a threat" to the 
status quo of this area in Sherman Oaks, Roscalvo said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, which will be reviewed Tuesday by the 
council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee, calls for a three-story 
or 45-foot height limit between Columbus and Beverly Glen. 
</P>
<P>
"The area between Columbus and Beverly Glen is as pedestrian-oriented as the 
other areas included in the Specific Plan," where the buildings "are one or two 
stories," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Roscalvo said the proposal would not interfere with the council's consideration 
of the Specific Plan. "It will move forward on a separate track," she said.

SUIT CLAIMS OFFICE TOWER MADE ITS OCCUPANTS ILL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: LEGAL EXPERTS AGREE THAT TRIAL COULD HELP SET STANDARDS FOR ALLOCATING 
RESPONSIBILITY IN ALLEGING SICK-BUILDING SYNDROME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louise Aldrich says working at one of the Airport Towers in El Segundo made her 
absolutely sick. 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes hurt. Her head pounded. Her throat and neck glands swelled. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich wasn't alone in her suffering, her lawyers charged in a trial that 
opened in Torrance Superior Court last week. 
</P>
<P>
They say similar symptoms began plaguing many of the 12th-floor occupants of 
Airport Tower C shortly after they moved into the spanking-new building on 
Sepulveda Boulevard in early 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged effects of fumes trapped in the 23-story building, originally owned 
by Prudential Insurance Co., has become the subject of a multimillion-dollar 
civil trial featuring 14 attorneys, a dozen plaintiffs, 10 defendants and 
nearly 1,500 exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say the complex trial, expected to last as long as three months, 
could help set standards for allocating responsibility in cases alleging 
"sick-building syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
The term refers to buildings in which poor ventilation combines with a variety 
of fumes to create indoor air pollution. Environmental experts say the syndrome 
has become more common in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Energy conservation measures begun in the late 1970s -- such as sealing windows 
shut and installing extra insulation -- and new man-made construction materials 
that release gases into the air have combined to create indoor pollution as 
much as 100 times worse than pollution outdoors, a recent Environmental 
Protection Agency study has shown. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the Torrance suit say indoor pollution and poor construction 
worked in concert with a poorly designed ventilation system in Airport Tower C 
to drive them from their 12th-floor offices. 
</P>
<P>
Defendants in the civil suit say that the building is not sick, and that 
hysteria stemming from minor glue fumes and the sight of inspectors wearing 
futuristic protective clothing precipitated the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Tower C, the third of three high-rise buildings Prudential developed on 
Sepulveda Boulevard, was the only one to allow tenants to move in before all 
construction had been completed. The other two are not named in the lawsuit. 
All three buildings are currently occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys outlined the case to jurors during opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
"This building was a classic and severe case of sick-building syndrome," said 
attorney Helen Eisenstein, who represents two former tenants -- a software firm 
and an accounting firm -- and eight of the 10 individuals who are suing 
Prudential and its contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of factors came together to make tenants sick here: Inadequate 
ventilation, construction fumes, improper operation of the ventilation system 
and poor choices of building materials," Eisenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"Prudential built a sick building and allowed that building to get sicker and 
sicker," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Prudential and its contractors, however, told jurors that 
"nothing sinister" was going on at Airport Tower C and that the structure does 
not suffer from sick-building syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"Through hysteria and through greed, what you and I would equate with smelling 
model airplane glue has grown into a situation where you are faced with making 
a decision in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit," said attorney Scott Hoyt, who 
represents Prudential and its property manager. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants contend that the initial glue fumes sparked a wave of panic 
among the tenants, who became "habitual complainers . . . who were feeding off 
one another," Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
"The inspector showed up in a moon suit and it scared people," Hoyt told 
jurors. "He'll tell you that that was an overreaction."

IF JACK CLARK RETURNS, AT LEAST ONE FAN WON'T

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that most Padre fans automatically, without question, assume that Tony 
Gwynn is being unfairly critized by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
They base these assumptions on the fact that he has been an outstanding player 
and has had a high profile in the community. 
</P>
<P>
I don't pretend to have any first-hand knowledge of the Padre locker-room 
situation, nor do any of the fans who automatically support Tony. I do know 
that the Padre fans were fooled once before. Remember, we were led to believe 
that Steve Garvey was the clean-cut, all-American boy. That image was certainly 
shattered, so let's reserve judgment on the Gwynn or Padre situation.

I just read today's article on Tony Gwynn, and I have to say Jack Clark is a 
lost cause! He's a bad example of a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, we pay him the big bucks to throw bases around. Secondly, it 
seems he's always sick or hurt. For one who complains a lot, if he doesn't like 
it, he can leave. At least Tony Gwynn earns his money.

After this latest of many tirades by Jack Clark, let's all give the guy a 
break. Before anyone calls him a crybaby loser, maybe someone should check to 
see if he's being poked by one of his diaper pins. With any luck, poor, 
picked-on Clark will be throwing his temper tantrums in some far off city such 
as Atlanta or the Bronx come next spring.

I would have been better off reading the front page headlines first instead of 
sports Saturday morning -- depressing as they are. 
</P>
<P>
What a way to start the day. "Clark Blames Gwynn for Everything," "Me and him 
don't get along anyway. We never have." Me and him . . . me and him. What 
revealing syntax! 
</P>
<P>
This 36-year-old, semi-literate bigmouth criticizes Gwynn for being a selfish 
player only weeks after publicly castigating his employer for offering him an 
"insulting" $2.5 million in 1991! 
</P>
<P>
Well, I've had it. If crude, cantankerous Clark is still on the roster next 
spring, there'll be no San Diego baseball for me.

GRANADA HILLS SURPRISES KENNEDY, 20-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistically, the game had the best pair of Valley-area City Section running 
backs, the best pair of quarterbacks, the top two receivers and the top two 
point-producers. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a new battery for that calculator, this seemed destined to be one for the 
books. Bone up on the math. The sum would be something. 
</P>
<P>
Added together, though, it equaled a game in which a special-teams play was the 
back breaker. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills High quarterback Bryan Martin threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to 
Derrick Stewart as the Highlanders defeated rival Kennedy, 20-0, in a Northwest 
Valley Conference opener Friday night at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
With Granada Hills leading, 7-0, in the fourth quarter, Martin settled back 
into punt formation. He made eye contact with Stewart, who had lined up on the 
left flank, where Kennedy had left him uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just an automatic," said Martin, who completed eight of 15 passes for 159 
yards and two touchdowns. "I noticed on the first couple of punts they took 
their time getting out there on him." 
</P>
<P>
Martin never knew how much time he had. In actuality, Kennedy had just 10 men 
on the field -- junior Ronnie Gipson was standing on the sideline instead of 
covering Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart collected Martin's lob and sprinted down the sideline, easily beating 
Frank Conley to the end zone for a 13-0 lead with 10 minutes 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough night for Gipson," Kennedy assistant Tom Sams said. "I thought 
we played pretty good except for three plays." 
</P>
<P>
You guessed it -- Granada Hills (3-1, 1-0 in league play) scored on each of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills fullback Brett Washington scored on a 19-yard run with 2:17 left 
to give the Highlanders a 20-0 lead. The touchdown also gave Washington the 
school career scoring mark of 192 points, surpassing the 187 points set by Greg 
Fowble in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders held Kennedy running back Ontiwaun Carter to just 81 yards in 
24 carries. It marked the third time in as many seasons that Granada Hills has 
shut down Kennedy (3-1, 0-1) with Carter in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of promising-looking Kennedy drives bogged down in the first half. On 
the Golden Cougars' second possession, Carter carried 12 times in a 13-play 
drive that stalled at the Granada Hills 24. 
</P>
<P>
On a fourth-and-18 play, Kennedy lined up for a 42-yard field goal, but holder 
Tavarus Logie -- also the team's backup quarterback -- pitched a shovel pass to 
Jimmy Rodriguez, who was hammered for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Highlander tailback Stewart broke down the left sideline for 
a 43-yard gain. Six plays later, with 4:23 left in the half, Martin hit tight 
end Kyron Motton in the left corner of the end zone from 13 yards. Motton, who 
made an acrobatic catch while spinning to his right and falling over backward, 
beat Gipson. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first points the Golden Cougar defense had allowed this season. 
Kennedy had outscored its first three opponents, 106-2. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy again failed to score on its ensuing possession despite driving to the 
Granada Hills 15-yard line, primarily behind quarterback Mike McMullen's 
completions of 19, 14 and seven yards to receiver Keith West.

CANYON OVERCOMES INJURIES TO WIN, 21-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canyon High had a bye last week and came into Friday night's game against 
Leuzinger hungry for action. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys won easily, 21-6, but the game left a bad taste in Coach Harry 
Welch's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Welch's 5-0 team -- ranked No. 1 in the Valley -- already had lost top running 
back David McDivitt to a thigh bruise. Against Leuzinger (3-2), replacement 
Mark Santos dislocated his shoulder and Jeff Bernards suffered a probable 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty banged up," said Welch, whose team begins Golden League play 
against Quartz Hill next week. "We need a running back to get healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Kevin Bialas provided most of host Canyon's offense, completing six 
of 15 passes for 70 yards and two touchdowns. He ran 11 times for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger helped out too, providing the Cowboys with excellent field position 
in the first half for Canyon's three scores. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the first quarter, the Olympians' Donal Byrd fumbled a punt and 
Canyon's Joey McKeon recovered at the Leuzinger 19. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Bialas threw nine yards to Chris Spahr for a touchdown and a 
7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger came roaring back with a five-play, 67-yard drive. Marvin Johnson cut 
back against the grain and ran for 49 yards, and quarterback Gary Mumin 
followed with a four-yard touchdown run. The score was 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
But the game was never close again. Twice Canyon returned short punts deep into 
Leuzinger territory and the Cowboys took advantage by scoring two touchdowns in 
a three-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
Bernards ran 10 yards for one score. Bialas threw 20 yards to Spahr for the 
other. Canyon led 21-6 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys' defense dominated the second half as McKeon came up with an 
interception, his fifth in five games. Leuzinger was held to 116 yards in 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
As if to punctuate its victory, Canyon mounted a 17-play drive that failed to 
produce a score but chewed up all but two minutes of the fourth quarter.

DEFENSE STANDS TALL FOR WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The book on Westlake High was simple. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors chewed up more yardage than all the cattle in Texas. And they gave 
it up just as freely. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, however, Westlake put all of its beef on the defensive line 
and stood firm during an impressive fourth-quarter goal-line stand that 
preserved a 21-14 Marmonte League victory over Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (5-0, 2-0 in league play) were clinging to a seven-point lead with 
less than seven minutes left when the Scorpions (2-3, 1-1) moved the ball to 
the Westlake one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
On second and goal, the Warriors stopped running back Tag Johnson up the 
middle. Then they stifled quarterback Corey Tucker, setting up fourth and goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was Tucker again. And again, he was stopped dead in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have put it in," Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson said. "If you can't 
put it in from there you don't deserve to win." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the underdog Scorpions were in the game all the way. The teams entered 
the second half tied, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors scored what proved to be the winning touchdown midway through the 
third quarter when quarterback Todd Preston connected with Erik Holcomb for a 
49-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
Preston completed 16 of 29 attempts for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also 
hit Seamus Gibbons for a three-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Preston also threw a pass that was intercepted by Tucker, setting up the 
showdown at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Reuben Allen, who had gained 604 yards in the Warriors' four 
previous games, was limited to 94 in 24 carries. It was the first time this 
season that he had been held to less than 100 yards. He did, however, score 
Westlake's second touchdown, a 22-yard run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, a porous Westlake defense had been concerned about stopping 
Camarillo's wishbone attack, and the Scorpions had to prove that they could 
stop the wide-open passing of the Warriors. Westlake got the upper hand, 
though, outgaining Camarillo, 326-175. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake took a 6-0 lead on its first drive when Preston connected with Gibbons 
for a touchdown pass. Preston's point-after kick was blocked at the line. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions took their only lead on their next possession. The 72-yard drive 
was capped by Fahali Campbell's one-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
After Allen's run and a two-point conversion had given the Warriors a 14-7 
lead, Camarillo marched 68 yards, Mike Madsen scoring on a 39-yard run.

HART BEATS QUARTZ HILL, 23-20, ON LONG FIELD GOAL BY VILENSKY

<P>
With a strong wind at his back, Hart High's Brady Vilensky boomed a 45-yard 
field goal with 1 minute 51 seconds remaining Friday night to propel the 
Indians to a dramatic 23-20 nonleague win over Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The kick completed a drive that started with 6:21 left and followed Quartz 
Hill's touchdown and tying two-point conversion with 6:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
In the drive, quarterback Ryan Connors completed three passes for 38 yards and 
Hart (3-2) converted two key third-down plays. Finally, after a personal foul 
on Hart moved the ball back from the 14 to the 29, Vilensky came through. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, man, you wouldn't believe (what I was thinking)," Vilensky said between 
postgame hugs. "I had complete concentration on the ball. But when we were 
moving it back, I was like, 'Hey, where are we going?' " 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. His kick cleared the crossbar with plenty to spare and two 
plays later Davis Delmatoff picked off Jake Haro's desperation pass to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Connors completed 11 of 19 for 208 yards, with Brian Bernier catching six for 
110 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Hart took a 20-12 lead on Tucker Setterberg's three-yard run after a botched 
Quartz Hill punt gave the Indians the ball at the Rebel 31-yard line. Quartz 
Hill (3-2) answered with a Selves Smith one-yard scoring run and a two-point 
pass from Haro to Jake Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Haro led Quartz Hill rushers with 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the wind dictated the first-half scoring. Quartz Hill, with 
the wind at its back for its initial drive, marched 58 yards in 10 plays, the 
clincher being a 23-yard touchdown pass from Haro to David Nelson. Attila 
Rethi's point-after attempt was blocked. The Hart offense, while waiting for 
the second quarter to get the wind at its back, managed to churn out a 
touchdown when Setterberg plunged from one yard in the first period.

Hesperia 28, Palmdale 14 -- Palmdale held a momentary 14-13 third-quarter lead, 
but Hesperia literally took it away with a third-quarter fumble return for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's Vashon LeCesne had the ball stripped by Hesperia defensive lineman 
Scott Bunting, who ran the fumble back 70 yards for a touchdown and put 
Hesperia in the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, three plays after Palmdale's Kalonji Watts intercepted a Brian Kalk 
pass in the end zone, Palmdale (1-4) took its 14-13 lead on Rodney Williams' 
91-yard touchdown run. ROB SONNER

Royal 10, Newbury Park 0 -- Defensive back Tim Ross forced a fumble after 
catching Newbury Park's Leodes Van Buren from behind on a 73-yard pass play and 
teammate Matt Tomaszewski recovered with 7:34 left to preserve the win at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Tomaszewski, a senior linebacker, hadn't practiced most of the week because of 
the death of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
He led an inspired Royal defense, which limited Newbury Park (1-4, 0-2) to 13 
yards rushing and 73 yards passing, all of which came on one play. 
</P>
<P>
Highlander quarterback Ryan Fien connected on a 10-yard scoring strike to Tony 
Liming on fourth down with 2:11 to play in the third quarter. Steve Prchal's 
conversion completed the scoring. Prchal booted a 40-yard field goal in the 
first quarter to give Royal (5-0, 2-0) a 3-0 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Fien finished with 114 yards, completing 13 of 28 passes with one touchdown and 
one interception. GREG MEADE

Agoura 21, Simi Valley 14 -- Agoura endured a scare from visiting Simi Valley 
before quarterback Sean Fitzgerald rescued the Chargers (4-1, 1-1) by rushing 
for two second-half touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley quarterback Tim Kirksey completed 17 of 38 passes for 236 yards and

</P>
<P>
However, Fitzgerald countered with a 14-yard touchdown run in the third quarter 
to tie the score, 14-14, and a 20-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's defense stopped a Simi Valley drive late in the fourth quarter when 
defensive back Sina Sayahi intercepted a Kirksey pass at the Agoura 28-yard 
line. BRYAN RODGERS

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY: SPORTSMAN DRIVER HALTED MIDSEASON SKID EN ROUTE TO SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While preparing for the 1990 Saugus Speedway Sportsman division season last 
March, Will Harper of Tarzana found himself in a meaningless Sportsman race at 
Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield, going 100 m.p.h. -- backward -- and heading 
directly for a retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, 'Well, geez, this is a great way to start the season. Let's 
total the car,' " said Harper, the 1989 Sportsman points champion at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, however, righted his wrong, deftly steering the car straight again and 
finished second among a talented field. 
</P>
<P>
Harper endured a similar fate in the race for the 1990 points title at Saugus. 
After a blazing start, he found himself spinning backward in the dog days of 
July and August. But he straightened out his championship quest, fended off 
challenges from Reseda's Larry Krieger and Simi Valley's Dave Phipps and raced 
away with his second consecutive Sportsman title. 
</P>
<P>
Harper's formidable 60-point early-season lead had dwindled to just 22 over 
Krieger by July 28. Phipps, a three-time champion, trailed Harper by 38 points 
on Aug. 11, the night of the double-points Winston 100. But Harper won that 
race to end a victory drought and then glided to the title. 
</P>
<P>
Harper capped his season with a win in the 100-lap Winston/Fall Spectacular 
open competition last Saturday night, the first of a four-track open 
competition for West Coast Sportsman drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The championship probably is Harper's last. He is trying to land a ride in the 
Winston West Southwest Tour. His first chance will come Oct. 14 at Mesa Marin, 
where he will race owner Bill Summerville's Oldsmobile in a 400-lap Winston 
West race. 
</P>
<P>
Summerville, apparently, had an open ride with no driver and contacted NASCAR 
for recommendations. NASCAR, in turn, suggested Harper. If Harper races well, 
it could be a huge boon to his chances of securing a ride and a sponsor for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure's on to do well," Harper said. "And I kind of like it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Other memorable moments from Saugus' 51st year of racing follow: 
</P>
<P>
* Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley finished in the top 10 in both Sportsman and 
Street Stock competition. Rayburn, the first driver in track history to 
accomplish such a feat, won his first Street Stock title, holding off Reseda's 
Dave Blankenship. Rayburn finished 10th in Sportsman. 
</P>
<P>
* Krieger, a 24-year-old second-year driver from Reseda, established himself as 
someone to watch with three main-event wins. He finished third overall in the 
Sportsman points standings. 
</P>
<P>
* Phipps, who breathed down Harper's exhaust pipe down the stretch and finished 
second overall, proved that at fortysomething, he still has what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
* Hobby Stock driver Jim Kusch of Sepulveda won his first points championship 
in that division. He held off Jim Gunnarson of Reseda and Oliver Aguilar of Sun 
Valley. Kusch will work in the pits next year and attempt to compete in the 
Street Stock division in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
* Kerry Mulligan (Jalopy) and Garrett Yamada (Mini Stock) each won 
championships. Mulligan nosed out Richard Smith on the season's final night, 
but Yamada breezed to the title ahead of Carson's Ed Fuller.

Two national-caliber rivalries will continue today in the Kenny Staub 
cross-country invitational at Crescenta Valley Park in La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' teams from Agoura and Palos Verdes highs will meet for the second 
time this season, and Charger standout Deena Drossin and Westlake's Jeannie 
Rothman will toe the starting line for their third meeting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura edged the Sea Kings, 61-62, in the Woodbridge Invitational on Sept. 15. 
Palos Verdes and Agoura finished first and second, respectively, in the state 
Division I championships the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers and the Sea Kings are the second- and third-ranked teams in the 
country, according to The Harrier magazine, a cross-country publication. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin is undefeated in three races this season, including course-record 
performances in the Seaside and Woodbridge invitationals. Rothman twice has 
lost to Drossin this season. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin won the state Division I title in 1989 and Rothman finished third. Both 
runners were Kinney national qualifiers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Individual contenders in the boys' races include Agoura's Mike Cherman and Ryan 
Wilson, Newbury Park junior Jeff Wilson and Westlake's Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks boys' team and boys and girls from Quartz Hill also will 
compete. MIKE GLAZE

Receiver Quinn Early, who lost his starting position to Walter Wilson after the 
Chargers' season-opening loss to Dallas, would like everybody to know that he's 
not a slowpoke. 
</P>
<P>
There has been concern that he doesn't have the speed to do the job ever since 
he came back from last season's knee injury, which kept him out of 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a bunch of bull," he said. "I'm getting a little tired of hearing that. 
If you want to line up a bunch of guys, we can run. My first year, I was 
considered a speed guy. Since I hurt my knee, all of a sudden people think I'm 
slow. I don't know where it comes from." 
</P>
<P>
In last Sunday's 17-7 loss to Houston, Early caught two passes for 36 yards. 
With Nate Lewis out with a thigh injury, Coach Dan Henning said Early will be 
the first receiver off the bench Sunday against the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to take the role they give me and play like I know I can," Early 
said. "I know what I'm doing. I have confidence in my abilities. If I didn't, I 
wouldn't be worth that much." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacking is becoming a little limiting for Billy Joe Tolliver. He'd like 
to broaden his scope. 
</P>
<P>
On his list of interests: 
</P>
<P>
1. Punting. 
</P>
<P>
2. Kicking field goals. 
</P>
<P>
3. Busting the wedge on the kickoff coverage team. 
</P>
<P>
Busting the wedge? Come on, Billy Joe, the Chargers aren't going to use their 
starting quarterback as a wedge buster. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I know that," he said. "That's why I want to be it, 'cause I don't have 
to worry about them throwing me out there." 
</P>
<P>
He may not be ready to displace John Kidd, but Tolliver is fourth on the depth 
chart behind kicker John Carney and linebacker Gary Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was all-district, all-county and all-area in high school," he said. "Larry 
(Pasquale, special teams coach) is an exceptional coach, but he's not seeing 
the real talent in me." 
</P>
<P>
Field goals? 
</P>
<P>
"I was making 35-yarders the day before yesterday," he said. "I'd have to say 
my cutoff is about 41 or 42." 
</P>
<P>
He paused and then shouted across the locker room. "Hey, Kidd, what's my range? 
About 41 or 42?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Kidd shouted back. "Forty-one, 42, 20. Somewhere in there." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers are 1-3 and have yet to score an offensive touchdown, but Charger 
linebacker Steve Hendrickson warns they aren't that bad. Hendrickson played for 
the 49ers last season, and he says the 49ers were glad they wound up facing the 
Broncos rather than the Steelers in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams like Pittsburgh kind of scare you because you never know what to 
expect," he said. "I remember watching them last year and thinking 'I hope the 
Broncos beat them,' because they were by far a better team than the Broncos." 
</P>
<P>
Former Steeler and Charger quarterback Mark Malone is working in Pittsburgh as 
host of WPXI's Steelers '90 half-hour pregame show. . . . Tolliver was told 
after practice Friday that he and his wife, Sheila Tolliver, are expecting a 
baby June 9. The couple has a 2-year-old son, Austin. . . . Henning's reaction 
to the $30,000 fine levied against Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche for barring a 
female reporter from the locker room: "No comment." DON PATTERSON

The district attorney's office is reviewing the investigation of the assault of 
Charger nose tackle Joe Phillips and is expected to decide within two weeks 
whether to file charges against three construction workers suspected in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said detectives completed their investigation 
Thursday of the incident in which Phillips was severely beaten by three men 
after a verbal exchange outside a Mission Beach restaurant Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to comment on the investigation's results or the strength of the 
case against the three suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney Mark Pettine said he is awaiting some final bits of 
information from the police investigation before deciding whether to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine also said investigators are "looking at other things" besides 
statements from three witnesses, Phillips and a woman friend with him during 
the incident, but he declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who is expected to be sidelined for another two months, underwent 
facial surgery Thursday, and Charger physician Lee Rice said the complex 
procedure was successful. Phillips is expected to make a complete recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Police plan to show Phillips photographs of the suspects early next week. He 
said he blacked out after being hit from behind but probably can identify the 
three men. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips suffered a concussion, fractured nose, fractured bone around his eye, 
bruised ribs, cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Possible charges include assault with a deadly weapon and assault with intent 
to commit great bodily harm on Phillips and also battery on the woman, who was 
knocked down but not seriously hurt. Police have refused to identify her, but 
Charger players said she was a friend of Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, witnesses were shown photographs of the suspects in a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Police have refused to release the names of the suspects and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The three suspects turned themselves in to police for questioning last week, 
but police said they were not arrested because they were cooperating with 
investigators. Police refused to say if they acknowledged or denied 
participating in the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
The three suspects are in their early 20s and weigh about 210, 190 and 170 
pounds, police have said. Phillips, at 6-feet-5, 315 pounds, is considered the 
strongest player on the Chargers.

CHULA VISTA TIRES OF TIES, ROLLS TO 31-8 METRO VICTORY OVER SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chula Vista and Southwest, two evenly matched teams on paper, had tied the past 
two times they faced each other, and many of the estimated 1,500 fans attending 
Friday night's game at Montgomery High expected another close one. 
</P>
<P>
They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista, dominating the line of scrimmage on both offense and defense, 
routed Southwest, 31-8, in a Metro Conference game. Chula Vista, the two-time 
defending conference champions, improved to 3-2, 2-0. Southwest, which has 
finished second the past two years, fell to 3-2, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
LeMar Bailey, who touched the ball just six times in the first half, was 
brilliant on five of them, scoring two touchdowns and setting up another. 
</P>
<P>
After Bailey returned a punt 17 yards in the first quarter, he took Chula 
Vista's second play from scrimmage 55 yards for a touchdown. The extra-point 
kick was wide. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Bailey intercepted a pass from Southwest's Andy Quinn and 
returned it 17 yards to the Southwest 33. After a penalty, Bailey scampered 37 
yards, setting up Steve Gomez' 1-yard touchdown on the next play. Gomez 
recovered a fumbled pitch in the end zone on the two-point conversion and Chula 
Vista, which had run just four plays, led, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista's next scoring drive -- near the end of the first half -- was a 
little more deliberate. The Spartans drove 90 yards in 13 plays over 6:29, 
capped by Bailey's 5-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
All three of Bailey's first-half runs were the same play. With Southwest keying 
on fullback Gomez, Bailey took handoffs on a modified reverse sweep they called 
"Rocket" and took off like one around right end. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what our game plan was, trying to get outside," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista scored 10 more points in the second half -- Rod Rodriguez kicked a 
26-yard field goal and Gomez scored his second touchdown on a 7-yard run -- to 
go up 31-0. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest avoided the shutout by getting a fourth-quarter safety -- Chula Vista 
snapped the ball out of the end zone on a punt attempt with 19 seconds left. On 
the ensuing possession, Quinn completed three passes to Leon King, the final 
one a 37-yard touchdown pass with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn finished with 264 yards passing, completing 18 of 34, but three passes 
were intercepted. JIM LINDGREN

KEATING PLEADS 'ABSOLUTELY NOT GUILTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a firm voice, Charles H. Keating Jr. told a criminal court Friday that he 
is "absolutely not guilty" of 42 state securities fraud charges stemming from 
his company's bond sales at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan branches. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, former chairman of American Continental Corp., appeared relaxed and 
confident as he entered his not guilty plea in Los Angeles Superior Court. If 
convicted, the Phoenix businessman and three co-defendants could be sentenced 
to up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The other three defendants -- Judy J. Wischer, 42, former American Continental 
president, and Robin S. Symes, 38, and Ray C. Fidel, 32, both former Lincoln 
presidents -- also entered pleas of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner transferred the case to Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito for trial. The first hearing in Ito's court was set for Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
After the brief hearing, Keating waved to several family members and friends as 
he was led back to the Los Angeles County Jail, where he has remained since 
Sept. 18, unable to post $5-million bail. Keating is waiting for the state 
Supreme Court to act on his request to lower the bail. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix-based American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection in 
April, 1989, and thrift regulators seized its main subsidiary, Irvine-based 
Lincoln Savings, the next day. Regulators estimate that Lincoln's collapse will 
be one of the nation's most expensive, costing taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges stem from the sale of nearly $200 million in American 
Continental debt securities to more than 17,000 people at Lincoln's 29 Southern 
California branches. Many bondholders have said they were misled into thinking 
that the bonds were safe or insured by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Both the company and S&amp;L are headed for liquidation, and the bonds that 
were sold for two years, mainly to elderly Lincoln depositors, are now nearly 
worthless. 
</P>
<P>
The state grand jury indictment against Keating, 66, and his co-defendants is 
the first criminal case brought against anyone involved in Lincoln since its 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
While Keating remains in jail, the other defendants have been free on much 
lower bail. After the hearing, lawyers for Keating and Wischer criticized the 
indictment and the continued jailing of Keating, who claims he is now bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Wischer's lawyer, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, called the indictment unfair 
and poorly drawn. "There's a guy (Keating) sitting in jail over charges that 
are not specific, that do not provide him with any notice and don't even accuse 
him of a crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's lawyer, Stephen C. Neal of Chicago, decried his client's high bail, 
saying there is "no reason in the world" that Keating should be incarcerated 
while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Keating is looking forward to vigorously defending himself against these 
charges," Neal said, reiterating that Keating posed no risk of fleeing before 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which lists 20 victims and alleges the defendants violated 
certain state laws to hurt those victims, provides sufficient notice and 
specific allegations to withstand any court challenge, said Sandi Gibbons, a 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
In court, defense attorneys said they would seek a preliminary hearing to 
determine if a crime has been committed and if there was reason to believe that 
the defendants committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, however, said it would challenge the need for a 
preliminary hearing.

UNEMPLOYMENT EDGES UP TO 5.7%, A 2 1/2-YEAR HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: MOST JOB MARKETS SHRINK IN SEPTEMBER AS INFLATION AND RECESSION TAKE A 
TOLL. THE STATE JOBLESS RATE CLIMBS TO 5.9%. 
</P>

<P>
The nation's slumping economy eliminated tens of thousands of payroll jobs in 
September and caused unemployment to rise to 5.7%, the highest jobless rate in 
2 1/2 years, the Labor Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In California, unemployment jumped sharply to 5.9% from 5.4% in August. While 
the monthly estimates of state unemployment are seasonally adjusted, they are 
based on relatively small survey samples and are not considered wholly reliable 
month by month. Nevertheless, the figures suggest a regional economy that is 
rapidly cooling. 
</P>
<P>
Although last month's national rate was up only slightly from August's 5.6%, 
unemployment has increased a half percentage point since June, lending support 
to analysts who believe that the economy has entered a full-blown recession. 
</P>
<P>
In another signal of economic slippage, private-sector employment declined by 
67,000 in September, while layoffs of 41,000 temporary census workers helped 
shrink federal, state and local government payrolls by 34,000, for a combined 
loss of 101,000 non-farm jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it's what we expected to see," said David Wyss, an analyst with 
DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. "We're staring at 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
"You can take these numbers at face value," added economist Martin Mauro with 
the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New York. "There's nothing deceitful here. 
The economy was in recession in September, and the only question is when it 
began." 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai, chief economist with Boston Co., said the decline had already 
begun when the Persian Gulf crisis caused oil prices to soar beginning in 
August, creating inflationary pressures that have further dampened the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is easy to read," Sinai said. "The economy accelerated its slide in 
September, and I don't see how anyone can interpret this any other way than 
recession. And it's not caused by Iraq. This one was baked in the cake before 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the economy's decline had been gathering momentum for months before 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Job creation in the private sector has slowed 
rapidly since early summer -- from 162,000 new jobs in June, to 18,000 in July, 
to only 7,000 in August. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which shed another 65,000 factory jobs in September, 
has been shrinking steadily since January, 1989. A total of 520,000 production 
jobs vanished during the intervening 18 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The construction industry, savaged by the coast-to-coast collapse of commercial 
real estate markets, lost another 20,000 jobs in September for an overall 
decline of 112,000 jobs since May. 
</P>
<P>
More disturbing, perhaps, was the fact that the once-booming service sector, 
long thought to be virtually recession-proof, has also started to lose jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Except for medical services, which created 45,000 new payroll jobs last month, 
the signs of an economic slowdown were spreading rapidly last month. Retail 
trade lost 10,000 jobs; business services shed 16,000; finance, insurance and 
real estate services gave up 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Employment declines continued in manufacturing and construction, and growth in 
most of the service-producing industries has either slowed dramatically or 
halted altogether," said Janet L. Norwood, Bureau of Labor Statistics 
commissioner, in a summary statement. "In September, for the second month in a 
row, more industries lost jobs than gained them." 
</P>
<P>
The 5.7% jobless rate recorded last month was the highest since March, 1988. 
The last time unemployment rose above that level was in November, 1987, when 
the rate hit 5.8% in the wake of the October stock market crash.

MONITORING OF VDT WORK LEADS TO MORE INJURIES, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Electronically monitoring the output of workers at video display terminals 
significantly increases VDT-related health problems such as aching wrists, back 
and neck woes and fatigue, according to a study released Friday by the 
Communications Workers of America and a university industrial engineering 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
The study -- lacking medical precision because it was based solely on the 
survey responses of a limited number of employees -- is the first to confirm 
years of anecdotal grumbling about the physical consequences of working at a 
computer in a monitored office. 
</P>
<P>
In these workplaces, the computer that allows VDTs to exchange data 
simultaneously keeps track of an employee's keystrokes per minute, the number 
of minutes the worker is away from his or her desk and, in service-related 
industries, the number of calls he or she handles in a day. Some workers 
complain that outside of scheduled breaks and lunch, they are not permitted to 
stop working for more than a few minutes a day. In addition, conversations of 
workers such as airline reservation clerks and telephone operators are often 
monitored by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Unions -- particularly the CWA, which represents 450,000 telecommunications 
workers who use VDTs -- have long insisted that computer monitoring violates 
employee privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
Less clear was whether monitored employees -- under pressure to work faster 
because of the threat of being disciplined for failing to meet an employer's 
computer-generated standards -- were more susceptible to VDT-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The CWA study, performed by Michael Smith, chairman of the department of 
industrial engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former chief 
of the stress research section of the government's National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, said monitored workers ache more than employees 
who perform the same type of job but whose output is not constantly tabulated 
by computer. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and the union sent questionnaires to 2,900 randomly selected VDT workers 
at the seven big regional phone companies. Some 762 workers responded. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said monitored workers were 59% more likely than unmonitored workers to 
complain of a loss of feeling in their fingers and wrists, 112% more likely to 
complain of stiff or sore wrists, 56% more likely to complain of neck and 
shoulder pain, 25% more likely to complain of severe fatigue and 30% more 
likely to complain of extreme anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for several of the phone companies said they could not comment 
because they had yet to see the report. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Flynn, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman, said that while operators' 
conversations are "occasionally monitored for quality control . . . we don't 
have any job categories where we monitor keystrokes." 
</P>
<P>
O. Bruce Dickerson, executive director of the New York-based Center for Office 
Technology, an industry clearinghouse, said: "I think it is much too soon to 
tie (monitoring) to the VDT (injuries). There are a lot of potential stress 
inducers in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Slesin, publisher of VDT News, a journal that monitors VDT-related health 
issues, said the report "fits into the picture that's emerging that there are 
many contributing factors to repetitive stress illness, not just the equipment 
itself. This is a different part of the puzzle. You're monitored, you're under 
greater tension." 
</P>
<P>
Some 40 million Americans now work on VDTs. A 1987 report by the U.S. Office of 
Technology Assessment, the most recent report on monitoring, estimated that 4 
million to 6 million clerical employees -- some who use VDTs, some who don't -- 
were monitored, most without their knowledge.

Savings Bond Sales Hits Three-Year High: The Treasury said the sale of U.S. 
savings bonds hit a three-year high of $7.77 billion in the year ending Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Boosting the total were sales of $544 million in September, a 3% advance over a 
year ago. At the same time, redemptions in fiscal 1990 totaled $7.54 billion, a 
1% drop from 1989. The value of savings bonds held by Americans rose 7% during 
the year, finishing at an all-time record $123.9 billion, up from $115.7 
billion in 1989.

Kluge Boosts Stake in Orion: Struggling Orion Pictures received a boost as 
majority shareholder Metromedia Co., controlled by billionaire John Kluge, 
increased its stake to 80% from 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Orion, battered by a string of duds at the box office, said Metromedia had 
exercised warrants to buy slightly more than 4.3 million shares of common stock 
at $6 a share. The transaction will give Orion, which lost $2.5 million on 
revenue of $110 million in its first quarter, a $25-million cash infusion. 
Orion's stock rose 37.5 cents to $9.875 a share on the NYSE.

AD GROUP HOPES TO SHOW HOW TO SELL TO BLACKS; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: A NEW TRADE ASSOCIATION SAYS MADISON AVENUE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO GET 
ITS CLIENTS' MESSAGE ACROSS TO MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Problem: Many of the ads created to appeal to black consumers come from Madison 
Avenue agencies with no clue about black attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence: Several missteps in marketing products to blacks have caused 
nationwide controversy this year -- the last thing advertisers want. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Why not ask blacks how to market to blacks? 
</P>
<P>
That is the rallying cry of a newly formed trade group, the African American 
Marketing &amp; Media Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The neophyte organization -- several of whose founding members are visiting Los 
Angeles this week -- hopes to eventually become to black advertising what the 
powerful lobby and trade group the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies is to 
mainstream marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"The black market has suffered from media anemia," said Ken Smikle, president 
of the group, which plans to open its doors in Chicago in February. 
</P>
<P>
"You see very little information on black consumers except how many of us are 
living below the poverty level." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks in America will spend an estimated $263 billion this year on everything 
from toothpaste to automobiles, said Smikle, who also publishes Target Market 
News, a Chicago-based newsletter on marketing to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
American marketers are expected to spend only $705 million this year directly 
advertising to blacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is small change compared to the $34 billion that the nation's top 100 
advertisers spent last year to reach all consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the black consumer to be accurately portrayed," Smikle said. "And we 
want black-owned agencies to be included in the considerations of companies 
marketing to blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, there were fewer than a handful of black-owned advertising 
and promotion firms in the nation. Today, there are upwards of 35. Their 
combined annual billings are believed to exceed $275 million. 
</P>
<P>
One top black agency owner says America's mainstream ad agencies -- which 
generally have few black employees in high-level jobs -- are a big part of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no need for black agencies if general agencies did their jobs," 
said Caroline Jones, president of the New York-based minority ad firm Caroline 
Jones Advertising. Jones, who played a role in creating Kentucky Fried 
Chicken's original "We Do Chicken Right" campaign, is a founding board member 
of the new organization. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies is the first to admit 
that the industry has failed to do enough to attract minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem we are still trying to address," said John E. O'Toole, 
president, who says he can appreciate why the new minority ad group has formed. 
"They're fulfilling specific needs that our organization cannot." 
</P>
<P>
The new group's board also includes such black media-industry heavyweights as 
Clarence O. Smith, president of Essence Communications, which publishes Essence 
magazine; and Thomas J. Burrell, whose Chicago agency, Burrell Advertising, is 
regarded as one of the top minority-owned ad shops in the country. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, however, is much more than a newly formed trade group. At issue is 
how American companies speak to black consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really no mystery how blacks feel about products," said Jones. "All you 
have to do is ask them." 
</P>
<P>
But many Fortune 500 companies still don't. 
</P>
<P>
And because of that, 1990 was a year when target marketing to blacks suddenly 
became front-page news in some American cities. 
</P>
<P>
In January, tobacco giant R. J Reynolds abruptly cancelled the planned 
introduction of a new cigarette, Uptown, after various black groups complained 
about the targeting of a group whose members already disproportionately suffer 
from a number of cigarette-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, after some angry minority representatives painted over certain 
billboards in Chicago and New York, the billboard industry's trade group 
recommended that its members become more sensitive in their placement of 
tobacco and alcoholic beverage ads in minority communities -- particularly near 
schools, hospitals and places of worship. 
</P>
<P>
And in late August, Operation PUSH called for a boycott of Nike products. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago civil rights group claimed that while Nike targeted black 
consumers, it had no black board members and no black-owned ad agencies or 
public relations firms helping it to promote the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nike has agreed to speed up its hiring of black executives, the group 
has yet to call off its boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Minority ad executives say all of these public relations snafus could have been 
avoided if the companies had only talked with them first. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible," said Byron Lewis, chairman and chief executive of the 
minority-owned Uniworld Group. 
</P>
<P>
"But its seems like the leaders of black agencies are rarely consulted unless 
there's some overriding issue in the news." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many companies also fail to consult with black consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of it goes against the grain of everything you learned in Marketing 101," 
said Samuel J. Chisholm, president of a New York minority-owned agency, the 
Mingo Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies need to figure out how to be more sensitive to this marketplace," 
added Chisholm, who is also a founding member of the African American Marketing 
&amp; Media Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Executives point out that marketing effectively to black consumers is not as 
simple as placing TV spots on "The Cosby Show," or running print campaigns in 
Ebony and Jet magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many companies take the black consumer for granted," said Chisholm. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just go out and tell black consumers that some new product is for 
them. Before you do anything, you have to show the black community that you 
care."

HALTING STEP TAKEN BY PORT IN ART PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THE PORT DISTRICT, WHICH REJECTED EARLIER ADVICE, HAS HIRED A HUSBAND 
AND WIFE CONSULTING TEAM TO HELP IT DECIDE HOW THE PORT'S $2.5-MILLION FUND FOR 
PUBLIC ART SHOULD BE SPENT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Unified Port District's fund for public art has risen as steadily 
and ominously as the fever of a sick child. Contrary to expectation, the art 
fund's growth has been regarded more as a source of anxiety, a problem to be 
solved, than as a windfall for the advancement of art in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In its eight-year history, the port's public art program has suffered far more 
setbacks than it has celebrated successes. As a result, members of the local 
art community greeted new developments in the program with skepticism, shadowed 
by a subdued sense of hope. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the port voted to hire Carol and Thomas Hobson, a husband-and-wife 
team of arts management specialists, to serve as their latest art consultants. 
Though their contract will not be finalized until later this month, the Hobsons 
are expected to spend their one-year term developing a public art master plan 
for the port. 
</P>
<P>
The news was received as a mixed blessing by many local art professionals, who 
applauded the port's continuing commitment to art but raised doubts about the 
Hobsons' qualifications. No one from the art community would speak on the 
record about their reservations, however. 
</P>
<P>
Both Carol and Tom Hobson have lived in San Diego since the mid-70s. From 1987 
to 1989, she worked as executive director of the county's Public Arts Advisory 
Council, primarily offering technical assistance to artists and disseminating 
information about grants and other programs. Recently, she organized a 
competition for a mural on an exterior wall of the Ramada Inn downtown, and she 
has also been assisting local arts organizations with staff development and 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hobson has worked as a consultant to private industry in the areas of 
systems analysis and staff training. His consulting work, according to Carol, 
"was with developing processes, making lines of communication clear, 
identifying modes of getting the work done." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carol has been active in the local art community for more than 10 
years, few of the other arts professionals contacted could pinpoint her 
accomplishments. None were aware of her husband's involvement in the field of 
arts management. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's hiring was the first long-term measure that the port has taken in 
several years to put its behemoth-like art fund to constructive use. The fund, 
which has accrued 3/8ths of 1% of the port's gross annual revenues since 1982, 
now contains more than $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A sculpture by local artist Kenneth Capps was acquired in the early years of 
the port's public art program, but subsequent efforts to commission works have 
been defeated. In 1984, port commissioners accepted a proposal for a major work 
by New York sculptor Ellsworth Kelly, but the artist eventually withdrew after 
the commissioners demanded numerous changes in his design. 
</P>
<P>
By 1988, the port's art fund had swelled to more than $1.25 million, but again, 
the commissioners could not see eye-to-eye with the artists selected by their 
own art advisory committee, consisting of local leaders in the arts. Mid-year, 
the port voted to reject proposals for waterfront art projects by New 
York-based artist Vito Acconci and San Diegan Roberto Salas, citing public 
objections and the commissioners' own distaste for the artworks. After the 
vote, the six-member art advisory committee resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, port commissioners approached Washington art conservator David 
Bull as a possible consultant, but their meeting never materialized. Later in 
the year, however, Henry T. Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Art 
Foundation in Los Angeles and former director of the San Francisco Museum of 
Modern Art, paid a visit to the Port District to assess their public art 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, like the members of the port's former art advisory committee, focused 
on advising the commissioners on the process of collecting art for the port. 
</P>
<P>
"My thought," he said by telephone from Los Angeles, "was that they should seek 
out, with some speed, two or three works of art already on the market, so they 
would see exactly what they were getting. Once those were in place, and they 
could see the reaction, they could go ahead and commission more." 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition process dominated the port commissioners' attention, too, until 
they met recently with representatives from the city's Commission for Arts and 
Culture. Those on the arts commission suggested that the port first devise a 
master plan for its public art program, then purchase or commission works of 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a logical progression," said Gail Goldman, coordinator of art in public 
places for the arts commission. "A master plan sets policy. It's doing the 
homework, then taking the test. Before, (the port) took the test without doing 
the homework first." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who is implementing a master plan for the city, added that such a 
document could help prevent a repeat of the port's earlier fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
"A master plan makes the process more objective. It establishes the goals and 
procedures. It identifies the range of properties and the necessary liaisons. 
By nature of a plan, everyone contributes and no one is feeling imposed upon. 
Everyone involved will establish a sense of ownership. With that ownership 
comes pride and, generally, success." 
</P>
<P>
Carol and Tom Hobson refused to comment on their plans for the port until after 
their contract is signed. 
</P>
<P>
"The past will be taken into consideration as we go through the process," Carol 
Hobson said, but she would not discuss whether prior consultants to the port 
would have a voice in the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
The port's ad-hoc art committee reviewed 30 applications before voting to hire 
the Hobsons and their Management for the Arts company. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the Hobson team was the superior one in terms of dealing with the 
public and developing a master plan," said Port Commissioner Dan Larsen, a 
member of the ad-hoc committee. "They're local, Carol has worked with a lot of 
people in the art community and that's helpful. Thomas had the management 
abilities and will help in dealing with public meetings and developing 
reports." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Hobsons' one-year contract is completed, the port's art fund 
will have risen to an estimated $3.1 million. How that sum will be spent -- and 
by whom -- remains to be seen, but members of the port commission have had 
their optimism renewed by the commitment to a master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"At least this has a chance of producing some forward motion in a program that 
has run afoul in the past five or six years," said Admiral Raymond Burk, also 
on the port's ad-hoc art committee. "Why didn't we do this before? I don't 
know. None of us are artists, or know a lot about art. We do have a desire to 
provide something of benefit to the people of Southern California. Finally, 
we're on to something that will show the real sincerity of our program."

AIRLINES, MAIL WILL BE FIRST TO FACE DISRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the federal government begins shutting down operations this weekend because 
of the continuing budget stalemate, Americans will encounter almost immediate 
disruptions of commercial air traffic and perhaps some delays in mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
With those exceptions, however, few people are likely to notice the abrupt 
cessation of federal services until Tuesday, when civil servants normally would 
return to work after the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
That's when virtually all federal workers -- except for the military, law 
enforcement personnel, postal employees and medical providers -- will be sent 
home if Congress and the White House have not managed to resolve the budget 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
At every agency, from Social Security offices to agricultural extension 
branches, a small number of workers will stay on board temporarily to begin the 
process of shutting down operations and sealing up offices. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown will be far more extensive than the funding cuts and furloughs 
expected under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law, which would have reduced 
financing for many federal agencies by about a third. 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman cuts could have taken effect if a stopgap funding measure had 
been signed into law in the absence of an acceptable deficit-reduction plan. 
The shutdown is required because no temporary funding measure was signed by 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Even under a total shutdown, however, a few services associated with government 
will be spared. U.S. Postal Service operations will not be directly affected 
because the agency is self-supporting through stamp sales and fees for various 
services, but it will face disruptions in the heavy volume of mail it moves by 
air. Mail will be delivered as usual today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak will not be affected for weeks, perhaps months, according to a 
spokeswoman. That is because the $519 million in annual operating funds it 
receives from Washington accounts for less than 30% of its yearly budget. In 
fact, an Amtrak official said late Friday that the railroad was exploring the 
possibility of increasing services -- particularly adding cars to its regular 
runs in the busy Northeast corridor -- to help offset cutbacks in air service. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all "essential" federal personnel responsible for protecting life 
and property will stay on the job. That includes security guards at Ft. Knox, 
doctors and nurses at the National Institutes of Health and law enforcement 
personnel of all stripes, including the Border Patrol, Customs inspectors, 
prison guards and the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"The San Ysidro crossing will remain open," a U.S. Customs official declared. 
"Goods and people will continue to be processed." 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman said late Friday that all Department of Defense personnel 
involved in national security would remain at work, including many civilians. 
But he refused to be more specific, saying: "We don't have everything all 
spelled out yet." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other effects of the government shutdown: Lights at the Statue of 
Liberty will be turned off. Tours of the White House will be canceled. National 
parks will be open, but there will be no rangers to patrol them -- or to 
collect admissions fees. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David H. Souter's swearing-in as the newest member of the Supreme Court 
will still take place Tuesday morning, but a White House reception for him was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Although negotiations to resolve the budget stalemate continued into Friday 
night, Budget Director Richard G. Darman issued a statement instructing all 
agency directors to prepare closing-down operations this morning. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few agencies that will be buffered from an immediate and total 
shutdown is the 4,800-employee National Weather Service. It has sufficient 
funds left over from the just-ended fiscal year to continue some operations 
through mid-October, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the service will be able to keep its 250 stations open for 12 
hours a day -- from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. -- rather than closing them entirely. 
Normally, they are open around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
But, without night weather forecasts normally provided by the service, there 
can be no night flights -- even though the Federal Aviation Administration's 
17,200 air traffic controllers will remain on duty as "essential" personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"They (pilots) have to have weather reports. Or else they're not going any 
place," said an FAA official. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of night flights will delay mail service because significant amounts 
of mail are transported overnight, according to a Postal Service spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
At the Social Security Administration, officials were making contingency plans 
to send nearly all 63,000 employees home Tuesday morning. The agency's goal was 
to shut down its headquarters, 10 regional offices and 1,300 local field 
offices by noon Tuesday, said spokesman Frank Battistelli. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that payments to the nation's 42 million recipients of 
Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits would not be affected 
by the government crisis -- unless the stalemate persists into early November, 
when the next round of checks is to be mailed. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service said it, too, would start a "total shutdown" 
Tuesday morning, retaining only security personnel to guard IRS installations. 
</P>
<P>
At the National Institutes of Health, in addition to doctors and nurses, other 
"essential" personnel will include some who feed and care for the thousands of 
research animals in the laboratories, ensuring the integrity of hundreds of 
ongoing scientific experiments, a spokesman said.

BARBECUE RULE ADOPTED TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving their battle against smog to back-yard barbecues and beach cookouts, 
Southern California air quality officials Friday adopted the nation's only rule 
intended to force consumers to use environmentally sound ways to cook outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Smog-causing barbecue equipment -- including traditional types of lighter fluid 
and pre-soaked briquettes -- must be removed from store shelves in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties by January, 1992, under the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District's new rule. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very small bite (in smog), but it's a necessary one," said Marvin 
Braude, an AQMD board member and Los Angeles city councilman. "We must regulate 
individuals' activities. . . . This is a genuine and important aspect of 
cleaning the air." 
</P>
<P>
The regulation marks one of the first times that Southern California consumers 
have been required to change their habits to clean the region's notoriously 
smoggy air. But it will not be the last. Sixteen other polluting household 
products -- from bug spray to air fresheners -- will be targeted by the state 
Air Resources Board next week. 
</P>
<P>
The measure does not ban outright any barbecue products; it only outlaws stores 
selling anything that emits more than 0.02 pounds of pollutants each time a 
grill is started. 
</P>
<P>
Propane and gas grills, electric charcoal starters, paper tinder chimneys and 
some fire chips and starter gels already comply. But lighter fluid and 
self-starting charcoal can be sold after 1991 only if manufacturers can change 
the formulas and provide tests proving the products meet the new standard. The 
petroleum-based fluid releases four to five times more pollutants than the 
limit, according to AQMD estimates. 
</P>
<P>
During two hours of impassioned testimony and debate, barbecue industry 
officials opposed the rule, saying it restricts Southern Californians' freedom 
to cook outdoors, which is as much a part of the region's popular culture as 
sunbathing and surfing. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of consumers who grill food prefer lighter fluid, according to 
the Barbecue Industry Assn., a trade group based in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to use what's convenient. And if lighter fluid is not on the 
shelf, they may use something that is much worse and much more unsafe, like 
gasoline or paint thinner," said Sandra Burton, executive director of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers warned that a survey they conducted shows that 70,000 Southern 
Californians will turn to gasoline to soak charcoal, which is extremely 
dangerous. AQMD officials said, however, that common sense will prevail among 
consumers because options such as electric starters are safe, readily available 
and cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Clorox Co., which makes lighter fluid and charcoal, and other manufacturers 
failed to persuade the board to grant them more time to comply and a less 
stringent standard so they can reformulate lighter fluid to make it burn 
cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
"This rule is unprecedented because industry finds its products effectively 
banned with really no chance to reformulate," said Pat Meehan, director of 
environment and safety for Kingsford Co., the barbecue-products division of 
Clorox Co. in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Burton said manufacturers will try to reformulate lighter fluid to meet the new 
standard, but whether they succeed by the deadline depends on how rigid the 
AQMD will be with its tests. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, residents of the four counties spray about 2,700 gallons of lighter 
fluid, which contains 100% petroleum-based compounds, the main ingredient of 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers using the fluid emit an average of two tons of pollutants per day -- 
equivalent to the daily emissions of 34,000 cars or an oil refinery. Refineries 
are the largest industrial sources of air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, 
air-quality officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical summer day, when smog is especially troublesome, use of lighter 
fluid doubles, with fumes reaching about four tons a day, the AQMD says. 
</P>
<P>
"This is symbolic because we're breaking into consumer products," said James 
Lents, executive officer of the AQMD, which traditionally has regulated 
factories and other businesses. "But it is more than just a symbolic move. In 
the summer, it would get rid of four tons of emissions a day. That's as much as 
the entire aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
Meehan called the AQMD's emissions estimates "grossly exaggerated," saying they 
are probably twice the actual figures. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers will not be arrested or fined for using lighter fluid or pre-soaked 
coals. Instead, AQMD inspectors will periodically check stores, and retailers 
who sell illegal products face fines as high as $25,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes were high for the manufacturers, who waged an intensive mail and 
phone lobbying campaign for months. From $2.3 million to $5.8 million worth of 
lighter fluid is sold a year in the four-county Los Angeles Basin, about 6% of 
the product's national sales, according to AQMD estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-smog officials said the rule is a small step toward a big goal -- removing 
80% of emissions in the Los Angeles Basin in less than 20 years. Eliminating 
lighter fluid will cut less than two-tenths of 1% of the region's daily 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The highly publicized barbecue proposal has been a symbol in the bitter 
political fight over the AQMD's 20-year clean-air plan, which was adopted last 
year. The rule is one of more than 100 measures in the plan that target the 
region's industries, cars and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Animosity about the issue remained Friday, and the board's 10-1 vote to adopt 
the measure came after one of the board's stormiest debates in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, an AQMD board member who cast 
the dissenting vote, said the rule will lead to "gangs of barbecue inspectors" 
that will harass store owners with exorbitant fines. He also said residents can 
cross into other counties to buy lighter fluid and bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
Board chairman Norton Younglove said Antonovich's comments were "pure 
nonsense," and board member Sabrina Schiller lambasted Antonovich as uninformed 
about the rule, calling his concerns "trivial and silly." Antonovich retorted 
that her comments were "pathetic."

(Southland Edition) LIGHTER FLUID EMISSIONS 
</P>
<P>
Consumers using barbecue lighter fluid emit about 2 tons of volatile organic 
compounds a day in the Los Angeles Basin. The compounds are the main ingredient 
of smog. In comparison, 34,000 cars release about the same amount per day. 
</P>

L.A. ZOO CHIEF ABRUPTLY QUITS DURING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Zoo Director Warren D. Thomas abruptly resigned Friday, his 16-year 
tenure ending amid allegations of chronic deficiencies and fiscal improprieties 
at the Griffith Park facility. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the resignation came just hours before City Controller Rick 
Tuttle released an audit that concluded that Thomas had violated several 
provisions of the City Charter in his operation of a special fund into which he 
deposited $78,003 in city money without the knowledge of his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, 59, will leave his $83,000-a-year post in January, and receive no 
special benefits, Mayor Tom Bradley said at a news conference. Bradley said the 
early retirement was voluntary. Thomas was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has been credited with spearheading efforts that have brought the Los 
Angeles Zoo a large and varied collection of exotic and endangered wildlife, 
but management problems have plagued his administration in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
For the last month, the zoo director has been under investigation by the 
Department of Recreation and Parks, which oversees the facility, because of 
alleged violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act that investigators said 
went uncorrected for years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also have been examining the special account, called the Zoo 
Emergency Fund, which Thomas created in 1987 and which he alone controlled. 
</P>
<P>
The money in the account originated as donations and as fees from film studios, 
television networks and other businesses that used the zoo for filming and 
promotions. The money should have been deposited with the city, the audit 
concluded. Instead, Thomas "diverted" it to an account he had established with 
the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., a private, nonprofit organization that helps 
run the zoo, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas apparently used some of the money to purchase equipment for the zoo, but 
auditors could find no documentation for expenditures totaling $2,344. The 
audit also requested that Thomas return $1,878 in unspent travel advance money 
that he had not replaced in the account. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Recreation and Parks Department officials were circumspect about 
the controversies, declining to comment on Thomas' performance or answer 
questions about the fund. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, Dr. Thomas is retiring and that closes all the 
books on any issues," said Sheldon Jensen, assistant general manager of the 
Recreation and Parks Department. It was not clear whether, in light of the new 
audit, the department might proceed with reported disciplinary measures against 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas decided to step down, Jensen said, because he was "very concerned" about 
damage to the zoo's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt that because of the recent difficulties . . . the Los Angeles Zoo was 
attaining a reputation that was denigrating that fine institution, both the 
institution and himself," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen credited Thomas with building one of the greatest animal collections in 
the United States, if not in the world. Thomas has also worked on projects to 
save endangered species and reintroduce captive species to the wild, Jensen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the zoo grew dramatically during Thomas' tenure and the facility 
has become one of the city's biggest tourist attractions. Last year, 2 million 
people visited the zoo and 50,000 individuals and families bought memberships 
in the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The department will not immediately seek a replacement for Thomas, Jensen said, 
but will instead undertake a study aimed at reorganizing the zoo and possibly 
turning its operation over to a nonprofit zoological society, similar to the 
group that operates the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation was accepted "with a certain amount of concern and sadness," 
Jensen added, "because Warren Thomas, although he has been in the press lately 
in a negative sense, has provided a great amount for the zoo." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' retirement brings to an end a turbulent era for the 26-year-old 
institution. A gregarious man who is sometimes described as charismatic, Thomas 
also is seen by some current and former associates as arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last month, Thomas referred to critics at the Humane Society of 
the United States as unqualified "Joe Blows off the street" and said that 
federal zoo inspectors did not understand how zoos are run. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had attempted to fire him in 1986, but he sued and was 
reinstated the following year by a federal judge, who ruled that his rights had 
been violated. At the time, the officials cited a number of problems with the 
purchase and sale of animals as well as Thomas' alleged use of racial and 
ethnic epithets when speaking about zoo employees. They also alleged that 
Thomas took zoo supplies for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
The recent controversy began last month after The Times reported that the zoo 
had been cited repeatedly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture over more than 
three years for inadequate food storage, sanitation and drainage problems, pest 
and rodent contamination, inadequate housing, run-down animal barns and other 
alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year ago, the USDA sent a certified letter to Thomas demanding an 
immediate response to a lengthy list of violations, but did not get a response. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, USDA officials said, they considered closing the facility. 
William DeHaven, a USDA official in Sacramento, said Friday that the zoo has 
made substantial progress since it reached a low point in July and is no longer 
in danger of being shut. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joel Wachs, who has been holding hearings on the zoo, said he 
would continue to press for a full explanation of the USDA violations and the 
zoo emergency account. "We're not sweeping this under the rug," he said. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Grandy, a vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, 
said it was hoped that Thomas' departure would "usher in a new and a better day 
for the future of the zoo." He said the city should appoint a blue-ribbon 
committee to restore public confidence in the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas will remain on the job assisting city officials in reorganizing the zoo 
structure before he leaves in January, according to Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Tellefsen, chairman of Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn.'s executive 
committee, voiced concern that Thomas is staying on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to be a very difficult situation with Warren continuing 
in his role during that time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit released Friday, the zoo association owes the city the 
$78,003 it held in the account for Thomas. However, the audit said, that amount 
might be lowered if the Board of Recreation and Parks approves some 
expenditures made by Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' purchase of equipment with the money violates the City Charter because 
such purchases must be made through the city purchasing agent, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
The audit also criticized Thomas' use of money from the fund to pay for a trip 
to Ethiopia this year. In requesting leave time for the trip, Thomas told his 
supervisor that the association would pay for it. In fact, however, the 
association's board had rejected the trip in 1989, the audit said. In the end, 
Thomas took an advance for the trip from the Zoo Emergency Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Tellefsen said zoo association officials will meet with the city on the matter 
and would repay any money due.

PRINCESS DIANA VISITS FIRST LADY, TOURS CHILDREN'S AIDS CENTER

<P>
Princess Diana visited two First Ladies Friday -- one who lives in the White 
House and another, only 3 years old, who is infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The younger "First Lady" earned her nickname because she was the first child 
placed at Grandma's House, a home for children with the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, dressed in bright pink overalls for the occasion, grabbed Diana's 
hand when they were introduced. The princess scooped her up, carried her 
upstairs during a tour of the Victorian row house and acquiesced when the girl 
asked for a ride around the block in Diana's dark green Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
As cameras flashed and whirred, the princess stepped out of the car with "the 
First Lady" in her arms -- a symbolic picture that gratified the founders of 
Grandma's House, who have kept its location unpublicized out of concern about 
prejudice and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of picture . . . a person of her stature coming . . . " said the 
Rev. Debbie Tate, president of a crisis housing organization that runs 
Grandma's House. "It shows that it's all right to love a person with AIDS, it's 
all right to care about a person with AIDS, it's all right to hug a person with 
AIDS. . . . It won't hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Diana's whirlwind trip, her second solo visit to the United States, ended less 
than 24 hours after she arrived in the country. 
</P>
<P>
She attended a gala Thursday night to benefit Grandma's House and ballet 
companies in Washington and London, and she had coffee Friday morning at the 
White House with Barbara Bush and others before her motorcade went to the 
children's residence.

The House gave overwhelming approval Friday to a comprehensive election-year 
anti-crime bill after approving more than 30 amendments to shape it along lines 
generally favored by the Bush Administration and many law enforcement leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which must be reconciled with a crime bill passed earlier by 
the Senate before going to the President for his signature, adds 20 more 
federal crimes to those punishable by death, shortens the appellate process for 
state Death Row inmates, allows the continued domestic manufacture of 
rapid-fire assault weapons and loosens the so-called exclusionary rule banning 
the courtroom use of improperly seized evidence. 
</P>
<P>
After amendments were debated nearly 13 hours over a two-day period, the final 
bill was approved by a vote of 368 to 55, with most of the "no" votes cast by 
liberal Democrats and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was viewed by opponents as a stern law-and-order package permitting 
House members to convince voters that they are tough on crime. The House did, 
however, reject an effort to remove a key "racial justice" provision affecting 
the rights of potential Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
This provision allows black defendants convicted of capital crimes to introduce 
statistical evidence before their sentencing to demonstrate that a racial 
imbalance has occurred among Death Row inmates in their states. The judge must 
consider this in determining a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, in a statement after passage of the bill, said that 
"this misguided provision" must be deleted by House and Senate conferees or the 
President would veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that this section would damage enforcement of the death penalty 
because it "would mandate consideration of statistics concerning racial 
characteristics of both defendants and victims" and impose unwanted "racial 
quotas on our death penalty laws." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) told the House that criminal justice statistics 
show that black defendants have a three-to-four-times greater chance of being 
executed than whites. The racial provision "is designed to ensure fairness in 
implementing the death penalty," said Edwards, who is chairman of the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
As the price for heading off a move by Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) 
to delete the provision altogether, Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N. J.), a key 
sponsor of the measure, successfully won House approval to water it down in 
hopes of meeting the Administration's objections. 
</P>
<P>
The changes voted would reduce the legal importance of racial statistics in 
determining a defendant's sentence. The original provision would have required 
a judge to consider the statistics as proof of past bias. The new provision 
would reduce the weight of such statistics to simply an "inference of bias." 
The revised wording would lessen the burden of proof for state prosecutors in 
rebutting the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.), who argued for the provision, said the General 
Accounting Office had discovered that, of more than 125 executions carried out 
in state prisons since capital punishment was resumed in 1977, "no white man 
has been convicted and executed for killing a black man or any member of a 
minority." 
</P>
<P>
"Think about that. It's incredible," Slattery told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the racial provision, Thornburgh said that House passage of the 
anti-crime legislation "represents a significant step toward assisting the 
nation's police and prosecutors in guaranteeing the first civil right of all 
Americans -- the right to be safe in our homes, on our streets and in our 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
The House acted to expand the list of federal capital crimes to include such 
offenses as a mail bombing in which someone dies, the assassination of a 
President or one of many government officials, a terrorist bombing in which 
someone dies on an airplane or other forms of transportation, treason, 
espionage or the causing of a death in connection with a drug crime. 
</P>
<P>
The House eased the exclusionary rule to permit the introduction of evidence 
seized without a warrant if a police officer obtained it in "good faith." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put the rights of law-abiding citizens ahead of a criminal's right," 
said Rep. Denny Smith (R-Ore.) in arguing for the change. 
</P>
<P>
Another House-passed provision would amend the federal bankruptcy code to 
prohibit persons convicted of savings and loan fraud from spending ill-gotten 
gains on their personal homes. In such cases, it would remove the homestead 
exemption, a legal shelter that usually keeps a bankrupt businessman from 
losing his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired of S&amp;L crooks who live in palatial mansions draining 
money from their innocent victims," said Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie (R-Ohio), 
author of the provision.

2 LIBERIA FACTIONS AND PEACEKEEPERS KEEP WAR BOILING

<P>
Not very long ago, it was an article of faith among Liberians anxious to see an 
end to their country's civil war that peace would return when President Samuel 
K. Doe left. 
</P>
<P>
Doe was captured by rebels and slain a month ago, and things have only become 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Today, three armies, including a "peacekeeping" force deployed by five members 
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), are engaged in 
full-scale war in and around the capital, Monrovia. Neither an end nor a 
predictable outcome of the nine-month-old war is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the West African force has gone on the offensive, strengthened 
by the assignment of a Nigerian combat officer as its field commander. Nigerian 
planes have bombed positions held by Charles Taylor, the strongest and most 
obdurate rebel leader, and soldiers of the 6,000-strong force have moved into 
Monrovia from their base at the city's port. 
</P>
<P>
But like all previous developments in this vicious conflict, these developments 
only further cloud the future of what was always one of Africa's most unruly 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
Liberians in exile and other observers believe that the political and social 
structure of the country has been so shattered by the length and ethnic nature 
of the civil war that it could take years to restore genuine order after the 
fighting stops. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the assumptions about how Liberia works have been destroyed," said 
one longtime observer of the country, "that it's not clear how the people are 
going to organize themselves into a political structure." 
</P>
<P>
The progression of tragedy has confounded Liberians and foreigners alike. When 
a group of prominent Liberian exiles met in August in Banjul, Gambia, to 
nominate a provisional president and government to take over after the West 
African task force landed, they assumed that an end to the turmoil was just 
around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought they would be in Monrovia by the end of September," says Ellen 
Johnson-Sirleaf, an exile who participated in the meeting but declined a post 
in the provisional government. "They thought that by this time everybody would 
be sitting around a table to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the weeks since then have been a succession of slim hopes violently 
dashed. 
</P>
<P>
When the two opposing rebel armies, under Taylor and his rival, Prince Yormie 
Johnson, arrived in Monrovia about the beginning of June, most observers 
believed that Doe's departure from office was the only way to restore order. 
But his death at Johnson's hands has added to the turmoil. Taylor declared a 
cease-fire late last month, but it collapsed days later after Johnson's forces 
unearthed a cache of ammunition hidden by Doe's forces and again opened fire on 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Doe was right," said a dispirited Johnson-Sirleaf, who once served in 
the Doe government but later fled the country and now works as an international 
banker in Washington. "He said his death would only cause more chaos." 
</P>
<P>
One disappointment to many leading Liberians outside the country has been the 
performance of the West African task force. The detachment's original 
assignment, to monitor a cease-fire, was its first problem because there was no 
cease-fire to monitor when it landed Aug. 24. It has been hampered by the 
absence of a clear objective ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, with the task force on the offensive, some observers question how 
long it can continue to fight Taylor. Taylor is convinced that its principal 
objective is to deprive him of power, and the force's sponsoring countries are 
not likely to have the resources or will to pursue a sustained campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Others complain that under Nigerian leadership, the task force's "peacekeeping" 
portfolio has been discarded. "I'm disappointed with the ECOWAS view now that 
this has to be won by military means, not by compromise and negotiation," said 
Johnson-Sirleaf. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Clapham, a professor at Britain's University of Lancaster and an 
authority on Liberian politics, said: "You have a West African force going 
about in a strange country, with little financial backing and little idea about 
what kind of political system it should set up. That's a recipe for disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Taylor in nominal control of the country is not itself a guarantee of 
order. Taylor's own force is largely disorganized, and his control over his own 
deputies is dubious; at least one has already set himself up as an independent 
warlord.

BRAZIL MAY NOT HAVE ENDED DEVELOPMENT OF AN A-BOMB

<P>
Will Brazil build the bomb? The question is being asked frequently these days 
as South America's most industrialized country re-examines nuclear programs and 
policies begun under military rule. 
</P>
<P>
President Fernando Collor de Mello, an elected civilian who took office in 
March, is trying to convince the world that Brazil does not want a nuclear 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brazil of today rules out any experiment that implies nuclear explosions, 
even for peaceful purposes," Collor said last week in a speech to the U.N. 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in New York that he had ordered the termination of a secret 
military project aimed at developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The previous week, Collor had traveled to a remote site in the Amazon region to 
watch the closing of a 1,000-foot-deep hole that officials acknowledge was 
built by the military for a nuclear test explosion. An aide said closing the 
concrete-lined hole "is to end, in the clearest way possible, speculation that 
Brazil wants to build nuclear bombs." 
</P>
<P>
SECRET PROGRAMS: But the Brazilian armed forces have not ended other secretive 
programs that scientists say could permit them to build atomic bombs. Former 
Navy Minister Maximiano Fonseca, now an executive with the government petroleum 
company, said in a recent newspaper interview that the navy has the technology 
to build such a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"I would even make one," he said. "I would make a bomb, I would explode it, and 
I would say, 'I won't make more because it is stupidity.' " 
</P>
<P>
The government announced in 1987 that the navy's Aramar nuclear center in Sao 
Paulo state had begun enriching uranium. The still-unfinished plant is 
officially intended to enrich uranium for use by nuclear submarines that Brazil 
is planning to build. 
</P>
<P>
A report in May by a committee of the Brazilian Society of Physicists said that 
once Aramar is fully functional, it would be "relatively simple" to increase 
enrichment to a grade that can be used to make atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Luiz Pinguelli Rosa, a leading critic of Brazilian nuclear policy who 
helped draft the report, estimated last week that nearly 1,000 of the navy 
plant's planned 3,000 ultra-centrifuge machines are now in operation and that 
the rest could be functioning in a year. When they are all working, Pinguelli 
said, they could turn 330 pounds of the lower-grade enriched uranium into 40 
pounds of the higher grade in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Conditions exist for building a bomb rapidly in Brazil," Pinguelli said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Collor's recent statements ruling out nuclear explosions "are 
positive" but that the president's words "must be followed by concrete measures 
to remove the control of nuclear programs from military hands." 
</P>
<P>
Unless safeguards are instituted, he said, "it is possible that Brazil could 
make the bomb secretly without control by civilian society." 
</P>
<P>
PLUTONIUM CAPACITY: The Brazilian army and air force have been building nuclear 
reactors that could produce plutonium, a byproduct of nuclear fuel that can 
also be used to make bombs. Those projects are further from completion than the 
navy project. 
</P>
<P>
A task force appointed by Collor in March recommended that the military's 
nuclear programs be continued with investments of $2 billion. The task force 
also recommended that the government complete two nuclear generators begun 
under a cooperative agreement signed with West Germany in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian-German agreement called for the construction of eight nuclear 
generators, but the program has been stalled by technical and financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
That civilian program falls under international safeguards that bar military 
use of technology or materials. But because Brazil has not signed the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, its military programs are under no such safeguards. 
Collor's administration has said it will not sign the treaty because, officials 
say, it unfairly withholds technology from developing countries.

A Soviet envoy handed a letter from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein on Friday, as Hussein ordered the release of four Germans 
held as "human shields" at strategic locations. 
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi news agency gave few details of the meeting between Yevgeny 
Primakov, a member of Gorbachev's presidential council, and Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second high-level meeting between the two sides since Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Its brief account said only that Hussein and Primakov discussed bilateral 
relations and regional developments, and "affirmed their desire for peace." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Ankara, Turkey, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu pledged 
$300 million in emergency aid to that country, the last slice of Tokyo's 
package for "front-line" states hit hard by the economic blockade of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu arrived in Ankara on Thursday on his five-nation Middle East tour. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also extended $500 million to Turkey in the form of trade insurance 
outside the framework of the emergency aid, a spokesman for Kaifu said. 
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Jordan, the politician who brought the four freed Germans out of Iraq 
said the men had been detained in "internment camps." Brigitta Koegler, a 
former member of the old East German Parliament, said she hopes to return to 
Baghdad soon to try to win freedom for more Germans, including women. The 
group, which had flown from Baghdad to Amman, later left for Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
One of the four former hostages, a young man, said he was held at an Iraqi 
base. He said he had been treated well and indicated that British men were 
detained with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you exactly where it was located, but I know also English people 
were treated well. They are all healthy," he said.

In a hard-line response to President Bush, Iraq charged Friday that the United 
States and its allies are mobilizing military forces and bringing the world "to 
the brink of a devastating war" in an effort to control the Mideast's oil 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's deputy envoy, Sabah Talat Kadrat, accused the United States of "seeking 
in a dangerously coercive manner to impose its hegemony over the world." 
</P>
<P>
In an address before the U.N. General Assembly, Kadrat, subbing for his 
nation's ambassador, who is ill, accused the Bush Administration of seeking to 
establish a "new imperialistic order" in the wake of events in the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The bitter truth is that this era is the era of the resurgence of Western 
imperialism under the leadership of the United States, at times with the tacit 
acquiescence of other great powers and at other times with their active 
participation," Kadrat charged. 
</P>
<P>
Raising the specter of war in the Mideast, he warned that the United States and 
its allies have mobilized forces "in a way that has had no parallel in 
contemporary history, thus bringing the entire region -- nay, the entire world 
-- to the brink of a devastating war." 
</P>
<P>
Kadrat proposed that the United Nations consider all the region's problems, 
"Palestine, Lebanon, the (Persian) Gulf and others," on the same basis. 
</P>
<P>
If, in the wake of President Bush's address to the General Assembly last 
Monday, any diplomats were expecting a glimmer of conciliation from Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's representative at the United Nations, Kadrat's 
toughly worded speech dashed that hope. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union joined Friday with Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait in strongly condemning the speech. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas R. Pickering, the U.S. ambassador, labeled Iraq's arguments "a 
distortion, a deliberate misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has looted and pillaged in Kuwait, has tortured. Iraq is an outlaw. It 
violated the most basic (U.N.) charter obligations. . . . Iraq should get out 
of Kuwait, and it should get out now," Pickering said in a rebuttal in the 
General Assembly to Kadrat's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Soviet Union, Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said 
his nation categorically rejects Iraq's assessment of events in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
And referring to the U.N. Security Council's sanctions against Iraq, he added 
that discussions in the council "represent the will of the council." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Kuwait's representative, Dharar Razzooqi, the Kuwaiti Foreign 
Ministry's director of international organizations, who delivered the most 
emotional response. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be ashamed of himself what he said here," Razzooqi said, referring 
to the Iraqi diplomat. " . . . Who is violating the charter? Who is pillaging 
my country?" 
</P>
<P>
His voice rising, the Kuwaiti diplomat looked toward the representative of 
Iraq: "I say to the representative of the Iraqi regime, we are going back, God 
willing -- we are going back to Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Kadrat was a substitute for Abdul Amir Anbari, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, who on 
Thursday suffered a serious nose bleed at the United Nations, forcing 
postponement of his planned address. The ambassador was taken early Friday to 
New York Hospital, where he was admitted by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Kadrat charged that the United States had embarked on a new era of Western 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
"America and its Western allies are seeking, through this military, political 
and information campaign, to gain control over the oil wells and to impose 
imperialist political, economic and military hegemony over the world, and over 
Third World countries in particular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kadrat accused the United States and its allies of pursuing "one of the most 
dangerous and pernicious campaigns of disinformation known to history." He 
charged that the Bush Administration is seeking to "put Arab mechanisms out of 
action" and to take control of the political situation in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"In a manner which has no precedent in the history of the United Nations," he 
added, "the United States and its Western allies had the Security Council pass 
a series of subsequent resolutions, each of which has had the effect of causing 
further aggravation and escalation of the situation."

HARD-LINERS DECRY SHEVARDNADZE'S GULF POLICY

<P>
Hard-line parliamentary deputies denounced Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze Friday and said any deployment of Soviet troops to the Persian 
Gulf would make the Soviet Union a target for Iraqi missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz (Union) group accused Shevardnadze of overstepping his authority in 
New York last week by declaring that Moscow was willing to send troops under 
auspices of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Who sanctioned Shevardnadze's statement?" asked Soyuz, which claims 458 
legislators in the 2,000-strong Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"Were we not assured . . . during the debate on the Afghan adventure that in 
the future any decision on sending Soviet military units overseas would be 
taken only with the approval of Parliament?" 
</P>
<P>
The 1979 Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan was decided in secret by 
top Communist leaders. The war lasted nine years, costing thousands of lives 
and leaving a deep scar in Soviet political life. 
</P>
<P>
Soyuz, fiercely opposed to radical reform and committed to preservation of the 
Soviet Union, recalled that Iraq had threatened measures against any country 
involved in military action against it. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that Iraqi rockets, armed with bacteriological and chemical 
warheads, would not be fired at the U.S. and Britain, which are thousands of 
miles from the conflict zone, but against our territory, against the 
Transcaucasia, the northern Caucasus region and Central Asia," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the person who took the decision on participation of a Soviet military 
contingent in possible military operations in the gulf have any idea of the 
consequences of such actions?" Soyuz asked. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi territory lies only 300 miles from Soviet frontiers. The buildup of U.S. 
forces in the area has already drawn expressions of concern from hard-line 
Soviet military officials, who charge that Washington plans a long-term 
stationing of troops there. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said Soviet troops could be sent to the gulf only as part of a 
U.N. peacekeeping force. About 300,000 soldiers, chiefly American, are already 
deployed there. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet Union still publicly rules out direct military action against 
Iraq, which attacked and occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Thursday if he was ready to send Soviet forces to the gulf, President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev told journalists he thinks that there are more than enough 
troops in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union was Iraq's chief arms supplier until the invasion of Kuwait, 
when it cut all deliveries and joined economic sanctions against President 
Saddam Hussein.

East German politicians now folded into the unified Parliament and Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's Cabinet will be earning salaries undreamed of under communism. 
</P>
<P>
There are 144 former East German deputies in Parliament -- which began its real 
work in Bonn on Friday after the ceremonial opening in Berlin -- and five 
Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament members get basic pay of 14,938 deutsche marks a month, which at 
current exchange rates is equivalent to $9,763. 
</P>
<P>
Former East German Prime Minister Lother de Maiziere and four others became 
ministers without portfolio, meaning the basic parliamentary deputy's allowance 
plus 20,134 deutsche marks, or $13,160, a month in ministerial salary. 
</P>
<P>
That amounts to 35,072 deutsche marks, or $22,932 a month, plus a home, 
personal aide, secretary and chauffeured limousine.

ONCE-SECRET EAST, WEST GERMAN SPY CAMERAS NOW ON AUCTION

<P>
East and West German spy cameras, long among the most closely guarded secrets 
of the Cold War, went on the auction block here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The pride of a collection of rare and unusual photographic equipment was a 
fully automatic camera from the workshop of East Germany's Stasi security 
police, apparently sold by one of the thousands of employees after the collapse 
of communism. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact origin," Uwe Breker of the Auction Team Koeln auction 
house said. "Someone walked in off the street and sold it to one of our 
suppliers who has a shop in Alexanderplatz." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, West Germany's intelligence service was represented at the 
auction, however unwittingly, by a James Bond-style miniature camera disguised 
as a digital watch. 
</P>
<P>
The bulky 35-millimeter Stasi camera, without any markings except the English 
words "German Democratic Republic" on its 50-millimeter and 200-millimeter 
lenses, was offered with remote and radio-control devices. It holds enough film 
to take 250 photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been mounted on an observation point near a building such as 
West Germany's mission," Breker said. "It could have been triggered by an 
infrared device every time a door opened or set to take photographs at regular 
intervals." 
</P>
<P>
The camera attracted police attention Thursday. Breker said an officer of the 
Federal Criminal Office demanded to know where it had come from and tried to 
prevent it from being auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed him our receipt and told him the auction would go ahead," Breker 
said.

NATIONALISM PUT ASIDE AS TWO VERY DIFFERENT GERMANYS COME TOGETHER

<TEXT>
<P>
Far more than the expressed promises of peace and cooperation, the mood of this 
week's celebration of German unity gave outsiders reason for comfort as they 
nervously began watching the early days of a new and powerful nation. 
</P>
<P>
From Tuesday midnight's throng at the Reichstag to the holiday crowds strolling 
Unter den Linden in the next day's autumn sunlight, to parliamentary President 
Rita Suessmuth's informal "good morning" salutation that broke the initial 
solemnity of Thursday's historic Reichstag sitting, there were few signs of the 
hubris that has so often clouded Germany's past. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of celebrating Germans were not aggressive; they were happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more (national) flags at a (German national) football game than I 
saw Tuesday night," a seasoned Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior Western ambassador added, "There was a lot to drink, but the 
mood stayed very sober." 
</P>
<P>
There were some ugly incidents. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people were reported injured Tuesday night during clashes between 
police and leftist street gangs in the Alexanderplatz, the central square of 
the eastern part of the city. And there were some confrontations in other 
German cities. 
</P>
<P>
But these actions were overshadowed by a sense of celebration more akin to New 
Year's Eve than a nationalistic triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good start for Germany," summed up one of Berlin's two mayors, Walter 
Momper. 
</P>
<P>
As the celebrations faded and Parliament returned Friday to its more mundane 
surroundings of a renovated waterworks in Bonn, the main challenge to German 
leadership was seen to be consolidating this new beginning in the face of the 
daunting job of putting together the two very different Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the beginning of a very complex task that no one has done before," noted 
Heinrich Vogel, from the government-run Institute for East European and 
International Studies in Cologne. "It adds a new dimension to what we are 
about. It can't be taken lightly, but it's manageable." 
</P>
<P>
Among the immediate challenges facing the leadership: 
</P>
<P>
* Holding its nerve as the tattered, former state-planned economy in the 
eastern part of the country continues to sink. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment figures released Thursday showed a 23% jump to 445,000 in the 
number of jobless in the former East German territory. Economists believe the 
figure could easily reach 1 million by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Public morale in the east has dipped since the heady early days of July's 
currency union, but considerable optimism still remains there. Yet, if this 
hope fades into disillusion, extremist causes could become a greater lure. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts see the quick resolution of a wave of unity-related property 
claims as instrumental in getting investment flowing into the eastern part of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for such claims is Oct. 13. They could involve as many as 1 
million owners of property confiscated from original Western owners by East 
German Communist authorities and redistributed or retained by the state. 
Processing them could be messy. 
</P>
<P>
* Dealing almost immediately with heightened expectations of neighboring 
countries for assistance. Coming at a time when much of the Germany's own 
energies are directed inward, this situation is a source of potential friction, 
some believe. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Soviet Union and Poland, for example, anticipate such help from 
Germany as they try to restructure their own crumbling economies. Other East 
European countries also look to Germany to help them through the most painful, 
initial stages of economic change. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has already promised $10 billion to Moscow to help pay 
the cost of withdrawing Soviet forces from former East German territory and 
granted $4.5 billion in credits and other support to Poland. But it remains 
uncertain what else he can do in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the full weight and influence of the new Germany will be blunted by the 
serious economic and social difficulties that unity brings, for the merger of 
the two Germanys is not so much a unification as a West German takeover of a 
region on the verge of economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
The initial cost estimates of unity have risen steadily as the extent of East 
Germany's industrial collapse has come to light. Economists currently believe 
it could take up to $60 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our neighbors -- including the Americans and the Russians -- think we are 
already the biggest, strongest and can do anything," commented former West 
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. "But it will take 10 years to fully absorb 
East Germany." 
</P>
<P>
A far more subtle, yet demanding task will be unifying the East and West German 
peoples, who, having developed apart for four decades, often seem to have an 
enormous distance between them. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Momper spoke of the difficulties at a news conference 
attended mainly by foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take quite a long time to be a state with one people who really 
understand each other," he said. "The people in (East Germany) have less 
initiative than we have. Everything was done by the bureaucracy, the party or 
the government." 
</P>
<P>
While East Germans will have to become more aggressive if they are to survive 
what they have come to call "the elbow society," it is also likely some of 
those elements that the East Germans might have to offer the union will be 
either eroded or simply swept away altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually close personal bonds formed among family and friends in a society 
where loose talk meant jail, plus the careful consumption habits in a society 
of shortages, already show signs of loosening. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a rise in the level of trash in East Berlin during the three 
months since the two Germanys joined their economic and monetary systems is so 
great that modest-sized East German garbage cans are no longer big enough. 
</P>
<P>
Momper also spoke of the pervasive impact of the East German secret police, 
known as the Stasi, which has left a legacy of mistrust and suspicion among 
both populations as they unite. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take 10, 20, 30, 40 years to overcome these different social attitudes 
and social behaviors," Momper said. 
</P>
<P>
Nurturing the understanding required to bridge this gap could be one of the 
most difficult of all Germany's political challenges. 
</P>
<P>
As Kohl noted in his address to the first all-German sitting of Parliament 
since World War II: "In this decisive moment of our history, more than ever we 
have to be capable of solidarity."

JUDGE CLEARS DISCOVERY FOR TAKEOFF TODAY;

SPACE: CONTENTIONS BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS THAT ULYSSES PROBE CREATED RISK OF 
NUCLEAR DISASTER ARE REJECTED. MISSION WILL EXAMINE SUN'S POLES.

<P>
A federal judge Friday cleared the way for the launching of the space shuttle 
Discovery early today after ruling that three environmental groups had failed 
to demonstrate that the launching could result in radioactive contamination 
over much of the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery, scheduled for liftoff at 4:35 a.m. PDT, will carry the 
nuclear-powered Ulysses into orbit and then send the robotic spacecraft on a 
2-billion-mile journey to the sun by way of Jupiter. During its five-year 
mission, the craft will generate electricity for its instruments by tapping 
into the energy released by the radioactive decay of 24 pounds of plutonium 
238. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters had argued that a cataclysmic accident could release the plutonium 
into the atmosphere, and they asked U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in 
Washington to delay the launching for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Justice 
Department attorney Rebecca Donnellan said that such a postponement would cost 
$350 million. NASA has insisted that only nuclear power can supply the 
electricity the Ulysses probe will need when it travels through the dim light 
of the outer solar system, but critics insist that even NASA's own documents 
show that a solar-powered craft, launched atop a Titan-Centaur unmanned rocket, 
could have done the job without the radioactive power supply. 
</P>
<P>
With the court victory behind them, NASA officials looked forward to today's 
launching and hoped for good weather. The weather was expected to be 
acceptable, but there was a 40% chance that showers would force another delay. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours after liftoff, the five-man crew of the Discovery will deploy the 
Ulysses, built by the European Space Agency. The Ulysses will give scientists 
their first look ever at the poles of the sun and thus could help them 
understand such things as changes in solar temperatures that have a major 
impact on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But to go into a polar orbit around the sun, Ulysses must first fly to Jupiter, 
five times farther from the sun than is the Earth. It will pass over Jupiter 
close enough for the planet to fling the spacecraft down and into a huge orbit 
that will carry it over the poles of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever seen the poles of the sun because the Earth and the other 
planets orbit around the sun's Equator. That incomplete picture has left 
scientists guessing about how the poles influence such things as sunspots and 
solar flares, which in turn are thought to have an impact on weather patterns 
on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery's commander is Navy Capt. Richard N. Richards, 44, and the pilot 
is Marine Lt. Col. Robert D. Cabana, 41. Mission specialists are Air Force Maj. 
Thomas D. Akers, 39, and Navy Capt. William M. Shepherd, 41. The fifth member 
of the all-military crew is the first Coast Guardsman to fly in space, Cmdr. 
Bruce Melnick, 40, a mission specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The flight is scheduled to end four days after launching with a landing at 
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

Map, Ulysses' Twisted Course -- The Ulysses spacecraft, scheduled to be 
launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery this morning, is designed to fly 
faster than any other device ever built by human hands. It is expected to 
follow a 2-billion-mile path through the solar system so that scientists can 
see the sun from an angle they have never seen it from before. SANDY KAY / Los

A traveling exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs closed Friday, leaving 
in its wake protests and a conservative attack on the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit combined Mapplethorpe's explicit homoerotic photographs -- the main 
source of the controversy -- with cool, elegant portraits and photographs of 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe helped organize the show shortly before he died of AIDS in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Boston was the last stop on the exhibit's seven-city tour. About 103,000 people 
saw the show during its nine weeks at the Institute of Contemporary Art, about 
twice the number that visited the museum all last year, said Arthur Cohen, 
director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the exhibit forced the national endowment's new director, John 
E. Frohnmayer, to institute a requirement that artists sign a statement 
agreeing to not use NEA funds to make obscene art. Some have turned down grants 
in protest.

LOTS OF OPTIONS COOKING FOR BACK-YARD CHEFS

When Tony Higson throws another shrimp on his barby, he doesn't pollute the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Charcoal lighter fluid was banned in Australia three years ago -- because of 
safety concerns, not smog -- and consumers don't seem to miss it, said Higson, 
who represents a company that manufactures Blazer, an alcohol-based gel that is 
squirted onto charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
"Products like this are completely safe, odor-free and pollution free. Everyone 
uses them in Australia," Higson said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire-lighting gel, which is expected to be available in Southern California 
stores in a few months, is one of several barbecuing techniques that satisfy 
the requirements of a new regulation that bans the sale of polluting barbecue 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Lighter fluid and self-starting charcoal will have to be removed from store 
shelves beginning in January, 1992, unless manufacturers can reformulate them 
so they emit 80% less pollution, according to the new rule imposed Friday by 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the unusual item on the agenda, several manufacturers showed off 
their smog-free cooking techniques by grilling hotdogs and sausages for 
breakfast in the AQMD's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We all grew up with the fluid. It's second nature to use it. But we need to 
find alternatives if we are to have an environment in the future," said William 
Brady of Meteor Inc., a Monrovia company that makes electric starters and 
chimney starters, two devices that meet the requirements of the low-smog rule. 
</P>
<P>
"If people know about the alternatives that already exist, they'd use them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James Lents, the AQMD's executive officer, said the alternatives are not only 
cleaner, but can save consumers money. 
</P>
<P>
Most gas and propane grills cost several hundred dollars, but they are cheaper 
than charcoal and lighter fluid in the long run. Electric starters for charcoal 
grills and chimney starters -- metal cylinders in which coals are piled on top 
of crumpled newspaper -- cost about $10 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD estimates that each cookout using lighter fluid can cost up to $1.59, 
while an electric starter or chimney costs 60 to 65 cents per use, propane 
costs 12 cents and natural gas grills cost 6 cents. Starting gels and fire 
chips are also less than lighter fluid, the agency estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even consider it a small sacrifice by consumers because there are so 
many products that are environmentally cleaner," said Riverside County 
Supervisor Norton Younglove, the AQMD's chairman. "At most it's a minor 
inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers say the options work just as well as lighter fluid. 
</P>
<P>
"People who buy the chimneys really like them," said George McHarris, owner of 
The Village Patio Shops in Irvine. "It may take a few minutes longer, but it 
works just as well." MARLA CONE

LET CLAIMS BYPASS PANEL, COURT URGED

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court was urged Friday to allow job-bias claimants to 
bypass the state's civil rights agency and file suit directly in court, where 
they could obtain far larger damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for two women who charged that their employer demanded sexual favors 
as the price of keeping their jobs told the justices that state prohibitions 
against employment discrimination permit such suits to deter bias. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest expression of public policy in California is through its 
Constitution . . . and the public policy of this state is against 
discrimination," David C. Anton, a Berkeley lawyer representing civil rights 
groups, said during a court hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for employers countered that workers charging bias should be required 
to resort first to the state Fair Employment and Housing Department, the agency 
established to review such claims, offer mediation and conciliation and promote 
settlements. Those cases can result only in awards by the Fair Employment and 
Housing Commission of back pay, reinstatement and compensatory damages -- 
although the commission's authority to award such damages is under challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Steven G. Drapkin of Los Angeles, a lawyer for the Merchants and Manufacturers 
Assn., said that sending bias claims to the agency promoted resolution of 
disputes without resorting to the courts. "It gives employers who screw up an 
opportunity to make ameliorative efforts," Drapkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The case has drawn considerable attention from employers, who have expressed 
concern that allowing claimants to bypass the agency will result in a flurry of 
additional lawsuits seeking big punitive damage awards. One study showed that 
California juries sided with employees in 70% of the cases, granting an average 
award of $652,100 in one five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Employment-rights advocates reply that the threat of such punishment is the 
best deterrent to wrongful acts by employers. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose from a lawsuit by Emma Rojo and Teresa Maloney charging that 
they suffered emotional distress from sexual harassment and improper demands by 
Dr. Irwin H. Kliger of Los Angeles, their former employer. Kliger has denied 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed the case because Rojo and Maloney 
had failed to go first to the fair employment department. But a state Court of 
Appeal reinstated the suit, saying the state Constitution allowed civil rights 
claims to be filed directly in court. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate panel called the agency's process "largely ineffectual," noting 
that the overwhelming majority of the 8,000 cases filed annually were dropped, 
settled or otherwise resolved without a formal hearing. Forcing claimants to go 
through the department would "diminish, rather than enhance" their remedies for 
discrimination, the panel said.

Beatrice Alexander Behrman, known as Madame Alexander for the collector's dolls 
she created for little girls and museums around the world, has died in Palm 
Beach, Fla. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Behrman died Wednesday of natural causes at her home. 
</P>
<P>
She founded the Alexander Doll Co. in New York City's Harlem in 1923 and sold 
it in 1988, remaining a consultant until her death. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a Russian immigrant toy shop proprietor, Mrs. Behrman first 
designed and made "Red Cross Nurse" rag dolls for her father during World War 
I. After the war cut off shipments of European dolls to the United States, she 
started her own doll company. 
</P>
<P>
Her Madame Alexander dolls began as rag dolls with hand-painted features. 
Adding such lifelike details as eyelashes and rooted hair over the years, she 
moved to plastics after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, Mrs. Behrman won the Fashion Academy Award for her doll 
clothing designs, and was commissioned by the British government to design 
dolls representing Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
The company has produced more than 5,000 different dolls based on characters 
from historic events, literature, music, art and movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I made dolls for children to play with and learn from of life and art," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Each hand-made doll requires three weeks' work. New ones cost from $40 to $500, 
while older collector's models range as high as $5,000.

AUCTION A GOOD GIG FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: VENTURA COUNTY DEPARTMENT IS $102,693.50 RICHER AFTER VINTAGE GUITARS 
SEIZED FROM A DEALER GO UP FOR BID.

<P>
The Japanese collector shouted "Eight thousand!" to the auctioneer and Brent 
Haesler knew it was time to quit bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Haesler, an amateur guitarist from Palos Verdes, was prepared to spend up to 
$4,000 for a classic six-string but instead settled for a well-worn 1950 
acoustic that was easily within budget at $300. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this many collectible guitars in one location," said Haesler, 
36, whose modest collection includes a 1957 Gibson Les Paul. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 dealers, collectors and musicians from Washington to Japan 
converged on an Upland auction yard Thursday night to bid on 87 vintage guitars 
seized last year from a Thousand Oaks drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
When the bidding concluded, United Auctions had taken in $112,850, and the 
anti-drug unit of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was $102,693.50 
richer, after deducting a 9% auctioneer's fee. 
</P>
<P>
The collection, which had sat in the storage room for more than a year, was 
officially appraised at $126,000 earlier this week by Mac Yasuda, a renowned 
Japanese guitar collector who bid the $8,000 for a prized 1962 Fender 
Stratocaster, the top price of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda dropped $23,000 on 10 guitars, mostly inexpensive acoustic models that 
he said are better suited for twanging than displaying in the guitar museum he 
plans to open in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"If this auction was in Texas, I definitely would have been outbid on them," 
Yasuda said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies seized the guitars, along with $76,155 in cash and a 1988 
Camaro car, during a September, 1989, raid on the Potrero Road residence of 
William H. Budnik. They reportedly confiscated five pounds of hydroponically 
grown marijuana, hashish, cocaine and psilocybin mushrooms and then claimed the 
guitars, money and car as drug-sale profits. 
</P>
<P>
Budnik argued that he paid legitimate money for the guitars, whose value he 
estimated at about $100,000. He dropped the claim after pleading guilty to 
possession of marijuana for sale and serving several months of a one-year 
sentence in the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The auction was held under an outdoor canopy with a jazz band accompanying 
registered bidders who wanted to test the guitars' sound quality. Haesler said 
some die-hard musicians put down the $500 required to bid with no intention of 
buying, merely for the chance to play some treasured instruments from noon to 
the start of bidding at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Sullivan, 57, of Thousand Oaks, satisfied a longtime desire when he 
walked away with a 1949 Gibson jazz guitar. Sullivan, who works in the 
electronics industry, said he has put off guitar studies for years because he 
lacked a finely crafted instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an affinity for Gibsons since I had one in college that I sold when 
money got tight," Sullivan said. "This scratches a longtime itch." 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda's $8,000 Stratocaster was valued at $10,000. Several of the most 
expensive guitars sold below their appraised values, while many guitars worth 
$200 to $300 netted twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of happy buyers who walked away with bargains," said Bob Mohs, 
the auction company's general manager. "There may be some purchases that people 
will be disappointed about once they come out from under the ether," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Mohs said he has auctioned off private guitar collections in the past but none 
as large or with the no-minimum bid and unrestricted ceiling stipulated by the 
county. The bidders also were among the most shrewd horse-traders Mohs said he 
had ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who came here knew exactly the value of each guitar, when it was 
made and who painted it," Mohs said. "Some even knew who owned a guitar before 
the collector who had it seized from him." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials suspected that Budnik might turn up to reclaim 
some of his most coveted pieces. Auction officials recorded no sales to him, 
but said his bidding might have been done by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Thompson, the Sheriff Department's property custodian, said the former 
owner could only have gone away heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lost a lot," Thompson said. "There are a lot of guitars here he could 
never replace." 
</P>
<P>
Said Doug Moran of United Auctions: "It would be tough for him to show up. Sort 
of like going to your girlfriend's wedding or being the bellhop on her 
honeymoon."

CALTRANS TO ADD MORE TRAINS, STOPS TO DAILY RAIL SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans announced Friday it is extending rail service to the San Fernando 
Valley, Ventura County and Santa Barbara Oct. 28, adding a second daily train 
that will carry passengers to and from San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with Amtrak, there will now be both morning and 
evening trains between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, in addition to the 
traditional Coast Starlight, the long-distance service that carries Los 
Angeles-Seattle passengers along the same route. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, the state Department of Transportation, said the new northbound Santa 
Barbara morning train will leave San Diego at 5:02 a.m. and Los Angeles at 8:20 
a.m., arriving in Santa Barbara at 10:55 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The northbound evening service that began in 1988 will continue leaving San 
Diego at 4:50 p.m. and Los Angeles at 8 p.m., arriving in Santa Barbara at 
10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Southbound morning service will depart Santa Barbara at 7:50 a.m., arriving in 
Los Angeles at 10:30 a.m. and San Diego at 1:37 p.m. Afternoon service will 
depart Santa Barbara at 3:25 p.m., arrive in Los Angeles at 6 p.m. and Santa 
Diego at 9:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stops by the six- to 14-car trains will be made at Oxnard, Simi Valley, 
Chatsworth, Van Nuys, the Burbank Airport, Glendale, Los Angeles, Fullerton, 
Anaheim, Santa Ana, San Juan Capistrano, Oceanside and Del Mar, with stops in 
the city of Ventura scheduled to begin next spring when station construction is 
completed there. 
</P>
<P>
These trains are part of what Amtrak calls its San Diegans, eight trains a day 
each way between Los Angeles and San Diego carrying 1.5 million passengers a 
year. It is the second most-traveled intercity rail corridor in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The number of trains between Los Angeles and San Diego will not be increased in 
the new schedule. One more train a day each way will simply be extended to 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy McKim, head of the rail division at Caltrans, said ridership has been so 
heavy on the Santa Barbara train inaugurated two years ago that service costs 
have been more than fully recovered through passenger fares. That's a 
comparative rarity in Amtrak service, although San Diegan service as a whole 
also pays its own way. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989-90 fiscal year, McKim said, 52,470 passengers rode the southbound 
train segment between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, while 47,253 passengers 
rode the northbound train. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans also announced a promotional fare for the service. The special fare 
will begin Oct. 28 and run through April 30, with some blackout periods around 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The one-way Los Angeles-Santa Barbara fare is normally $18. During the 
promotion, a same-day round trip will be sold for only $1 more, $19. For trips 
not completed the same day, the round trip will be $25. 
</P>
<P>
The one-way San Diego-Santa Barbara fare is $29.50. During the promotion, a 
round trip completed the same day will be $30.50, and a round trip completed in 
more than one day will be $36.50. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the expansion of service comes at a time when the passage of $3 
billion in rail bonds by the California electorate and new spending priorities 
by the California Transportation Commission has raised the prospect of vastly 
increased commuter and inter-city rail service in Southern California in the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, for example, transportation officials have announced plans to 
introduce commuter rail service by 1993 between Los Angeles and such points as 
Orange County, San Bernardino, Santa Clarita and Oxnard. Commuter service also 
is envisioned in the next few years between San Diego and Oceanside and between 
Riverside and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Although these projects are part of the state's seven-year transportation plan, 
officials have cautioned that in many cases local funds are required to provide 
operating subsidies and some capital investments, which raises doubts about 
whether the plans will be realized, or realized on time. Federal funds also may 
be required to help develop certain lines. 
</P>
<P>
Another impediment could be a shortage of rail cars. The supply has been tight 
nationwide.

FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR ARRAIGNED ON CHARGES OF RUNNING A COCAINE RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles lawyer and former federal prosecutor was arrested Friday outside 
his Pacific Palisades house on charges -- detailed in indictments in San Diego 
and Phoenix -- that he ran a cocaine ring with his clients and failed to pay 
taxes on drug money, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also suggested that Juan Paul Robertson, 44, stole $980,000 cash, a 
1979 Cadillac and two kilograms of cocaine from his clients. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it the "ultimate betrayal," U.S. Atty. William Braniff in San Diego 
said Robertson had taken the cash, car and cocaine from California to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who prosecuted criminal cases as an assistant U.S. attorney from 
1976 to 1980, pleaded innocent to the charges during an arraignment Friday 
afternoon in federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine-related charges were filed in San Diego because agents believe most 
of the cocaine was distributed in northern San Diego County, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax charges were filed in Phoenix because Robertson maintained a house in 
Paradise Valley, Ariz., from 1984 through 1988, and because the $980,000 cash, 
the Cadillac and the cocaine were transported to Arizona, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego indictment, filed Thursday, details eight felony counts -- 
including a racketeering charge -- linked to the cocaine ring, which 
prosecutors said Robertson directed from 1983 through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges Robertson with one count of conspiracy to possess 
cocaine, three counts of distributing cocaine, a sole count of using the 
telephone to distribute cocaine, a single count of running a "continuing 
criminal enterprise" and one count of criminal racketeering.

PROP. 128 FAVORED BY 2-1 MARGIN IN O.C., POLL SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new poll of Orange County voters shows that they favor Proposition 128, the 
Big Green initiative, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, a much broader base of 
support than among voters statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Baldassare, a UC Irvine professor of social ecology who authored the 
survey, said that 58% of Orange County voters said they would vote for 
Proposition 128, 27% said they opposed it and 15% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times poll taken late last month showed voters statewide favored 
the measure 44% to 42%, with 14% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said he believes the strong local support for Proposition 128 shows 
a population fed up with air pollution and shaken by the 394,000-gallon oil 
spill in Huntington Beach on Feb. 7, which tarnished miles of Orange County 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a year of unprecedented concern about the environment," 
Baldassare said. "What we have here is an electorate very interested in 
environmental issues close to home. There was the oil spill, and people are 
also hearing an awful lot about the bad quality of the air. It bothers them." 
</P>
<P>
The survey polled 1,016 adult residents by telephone from Sept. 5 to Sept. 21. 
Of those surveyed, 833 were registered voters who were asked questions about 
initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot, including Proposition 128. The margin of 
error for the sample of voters is plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said he would not be surprised if local support for Proposition 128 
declines when Orange County voters, who have repeatedly spurned ballot measures 
that would have raised taxes or imposed higher fees, learn more about how it 
will affect their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"You have two very strong competing forces here: the concern about the 
environment and Orange County's historically deep resistance to taxes and 
higher spending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Local support for the proposition on Election Day may also be weakened by 
voting patterns that traditionally find higher turnout among older voters than 
among younger ones, Baldassare said. His survey showed that only 38% of those 
55 and older supported Proposition 128, while support increased to 58% among 
those 35 to 54 and 73% among those 18 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll from Sept. 20 to 25 showed that support for Proposition 128 was 
suffering because of the negative public image of its sponsor, liberal 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). Baldassare said respondents were not 
asked about Hayden or his association with the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Respondents in the Orange County poll were asked: "If the election were held 
today, would you vote yes or no on Proposition 128, called by some the Big 
Green Initiative, which would include provisions to regulate and phase out some 
pesticides, phase out chemicals that may deplete the Earth's ozone layer, 
require reduced emissions of gases contributing to global warming, limit oil 
drilling off the California coast and require oil spill prevention plans, 
create the elected office of environmental advocate and authorize $300 million 
in bonds to purchase ancient Redwood forests?" 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 drew solid majority support from both sexes in Orange County, 
although women backed it by a bigger margin than men, with 63% of women and 51% 
of men supporting it. In The Times statewide poll, men opposed Big Green by a 
gap of 10 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
The measure found stronger support within political parties locally than 
statewide. In Orange County, Democrats supported it by a 4-to-1 margin (68% in 
favor, 16% opposed and 16% undecided), compared with 2-to-1 statewide. 
Republicans back it locally (52% in favor, 33% opposed and 15% undecided), but 
oppose it by more than a 2-to-1 margin statewide.

D.A. REVIEWS PLANNER'S POTENTIAL CONFLICTS; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE: TWO COMPANIES OWNED IN PART BY DON GREEK WERE AWARDED AT LEAST $104,000 
IN CONTRACTS WHILE HE WAS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER, INVESTIGATORS FIND.

<P>
While Don Greek was a city planning commissioner, two companies he owns in part 
were awarded at least $104,000 worth of city projects, a potential conflict of 
interest now being reviewed by the district attorney's office, according to 
documents released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Greek, who resigned from the Planning Commission in August to run for City 
Council in the Nov. 6 election, was warned in a 1986 letter from then-City 
Atty. Gene R. Minshew that the payments could be considered improper under a 
state conflict-of-interest code. 
</P>
<P>
"You and I have talked twice about this matter," Minshew wrote. "I have a 
feeling that you may not be giving the matter the attention it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Greek said Friday that he does not remember receiving the letter or discussing 
the matter with Minshew. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had received it, I probably would have reacted to it, but I don't have 
any recollection of reacting to it, and I don't have any recollection of the 
letter. I honestly can't remember it," said Greek, who was a commissioner from 
1983 until August. 
</P>
<P>
Documentation of eight engineering projects awarded to DGA Consultants Inc. and 
Don Greek &amp; Associates from 1986 to June and Minshew's letter were released 
Friday by Corrado &amp; Newton, a law firm hired by the City Council to look 
into city contracting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The documents were copies of those turned over to the district attorney's 
office. Robert Corrado, special counsel to the City Council, released the 
documents after the district attorney's review became public earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The documents include copies of invoices from DGA Consultants Inc. and Don 
Greek &amp; Associates and checks from the city totaling more than $104,000. 
The largest of the projects was a $44,000 contract to analyze street alignments 
and improvements for a joint Orange-Santa Ana project. The average contract 
amount was $4,013. 
</P>
<P>
Projects of less than $10,000 are generally awarded by city staff members 
without City Council approval, said Bert Yamasaki, Orange's administrator of 
economic development; contracts worth more than that must be bid and require a 
City Council vote. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. John D. Conley is reviewing the situation after a 
conflict-of-interest complaint was filed Monday by local political activist 
Shirley Grindle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 letter to Greek, Minshew details a case in San Diego where an 
appeals court ruled that it was a conflict of interest under the City Charter 
and state law for a parks and recreation board member to have his business 
enter into contracts with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Because the City Council and not the Planning Commission has final approval of 
contracts, Minshew added, "it does not appear to me that there is a conflict of 
interest in your situation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Minshew said, Greek should be "concerned" about the San Diego court 
decision and should consult his attorney "to be sure that there will be no 
violation of Government Code Section 1090." 
</P>
<P>
That section says state, county and city employees and officers "shall not be 
financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity 
or by any body or board of which they are members." 
</P>
<P>
Greek said Friday that he believes that the investigation was instigated by 
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz, a foe in the City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I haven't done anything wrong," Greek said, "and I also know it's a 
misuse of city funds to use them to discourage me from running for office." 
</P>
<P>
Coontz replied that the Greek inquiry emerged from an overall review of the 
city's contracting procedures and was not directed at him. 
</P>
<P>
"In the process of learning about contracts, we ran across this and asked, was 
this legal for a person who was on the Planning Commission," Coontz said. 
"That's all it was, just everyday procedure."

A former mathematics teacher at Willard Intermediate School has been charged 
with molesting two male students on campus, and police said Friday that he has 
reportedly fled the state to avoid prosecution. A federal arrest warrant was 
issued Wednesday, charging Enrique Solorzano Provence, 37, with felony unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution, said Lt. Robert Helton of the Santa Ana Police 
Department, which investigated the alleged molestations. 
</P>
<P>
Provence, who allegedly fled the area April 3, was charged in an arrest warrant 
issued April 11 with two counts each of child molestation and child annoyance 
involving the students, Helton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Child molesting is a felony; child annoyance, a crime in which there is no 
actual skin contact, is a misdemeanor charge. "It's the type of case when an 
individual attempts to excite an individual (without) skin contact," Helton 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the two students, police are concerned about the welfare of a 
14-year-old Willard student whom Provence identified as his son. Investigators 
who checked the boy's Mexican birth certificate with officials in Mexico were 
told that no such record could be found. Helton said they are now uncertain of 
the boy's identity, and believe that Provence may have produced a bogus birth 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Provence and the youth referred to each other as son and father but police are 
concerned because of the nature of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some concern because of a discrepancy with the birth certificate," 
Helton said. "We're very concerned with identifying who he actually is. We're 
not positive that he is his son, so we're concerned for his well-being. 
</P>
<P>
"The information that we have uncovered has led us to believe that he may be in 
either Alberta, Canada, or Laredo, Tex.," Helton said. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Provence, who taught math in both Spanish and English to seventh graders, is 
accused of twice molesting an 11-year-old student, and of two acts of child 
annoyance involving a 12-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
All four incidents allegedly occurred during school hours on the campus at 1342 
N. Ross St., Helton said. The boys told investigators that the encounters 
occurred during the 1989 holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims spoke in March to a school counselor, who then contacted the 
Orange County Child Abuse Registry. The Santa Ana Unified School District 
placed Provence on administrative leave while police began an investigation 
into the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said 60 students of Provence were interviewed by police investigators, 
and that two more boys came forward, claiming they had sexual encounters with 
the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Before he disappeared, Helton added, Provence was "very distraught" during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Diane Thomas said Provence had worked at the school less 
than a year, and taught no other subjects besides math. She said he was 
involved in a program called family math, in which parents are invited to join 
their children at the school for math classes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that a warrant is out for his arrest," Thomas added. "It is our 
policy not to comment further when a matter is under police investigation." 
</P>
<P>
A teacher at Willard, who asked to remain anonymous, said the faculty was aware 
of the investigation for months but was asked not to talk about it. Provence 
had been hired last September to teach math, the teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Provence lived in a Durant Street apartment a block from the campus from 
January until late March, the manager of the Durant Court Apartments said 
Friday. He shared his $525-a-month studio apartment with a teen-age boy, 
possibly his son, said the manager, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of March, the manager said, a woman claiming to be a friend of the 
Provence family said Provence was in the hospital and she was at the apartment 
to pick up his son. The manager said the boy left willingly. Neither the boy 
nor Provence has been seen at the apartment since. 
</P>
<P>
Police described Provence as a Latino, 5 feet, 6 inches tall, 145 pounds with 
black hair, brown eyes and glasses. He drove a blue 1978 Mercury Marquis. 
</P>
<P>
A detective has been assigned full time to the case and Santa Ana police have 
sought the help of Texas and Canadian authorities, alerting them to the arrest 
warrants. The warrant charging Provence with child molestation and annoyance 
carries a $100,000 bail.

TAX INITIATIVE BACKERS RAISE $222,245 TO ZERO FOR FOES

<P>
Supporters of Measure M, the transportation sales tax initiative, have raised 
more than $220,000, only about one-third as much as they had raised at this 
point during last year's unsuccessful campaign for the measure, according to 
campaign finance reports filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Measure M group is planning a lower-key, less-expensive campaign this 
year after a glitzy $2-million effort failed during November's off-year 
election. Through Sept. 30, the group had raised $222,245, with available cash 
of $83,263 and unpaid bills of $140,283, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M foes did not file a finance report Friday because they have not 
raised any money, said Tom Rogers, one of the leaders of the No on M campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said the group's only financial activity so far consists of acquiring 
about $900 in unpaid legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
The largest contributors to the Yes on M campaign were the Building Industry 
Assn., Disneyland, Fieldstone Co., Irvine Co., Rancho Santa Margarita Co. and 
Shea Homes, each of which gave at least $25,000. C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons 
gave $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign committees and candidates must file another finance statement Oct. 25, 
their last comprehensive report before the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, Measure M would increase the sales tax in the county by half a 
cent to pay for county transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In the hotly contested 72nd Assembly District, Democrat Tom Umberg's campaign 
staff was still compiling his latest contribution totals Friday night, but 
campaign manager George Urch said he has raised about $263,000 this year and 
has about $52,000 cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing pretty well. . . , considering Tom is the non-incumbent," Urch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If those estimates prove to be correct, Umberg will be ahead of incumbent 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in fund raising. Pringle reported 
total contributions for the year of $175,509, with $73,546 in cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said he hopes to raise $350,000 by the time the race is over. "I think 
I'm basically on target for what I need to spend," Pringle said. "There is a 
possibility I will be outspent." 
</P>
<P>
In the 58th Assembly District, Republican candidate Tom Mays has raised 
$170,819, more than four times as much as his opponent, Democrat Luanne W. 
Pryor, who has raised $37,357. Mays, the mayor of Huntington Beach, and Pryor, 
a Long Beach activist and public relations executive, are hoping to capture the 
seat vacated by Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos), who is not running 
for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
In the only race for county supervisor, incumbent Harriett M. Wieder was 
expected to raise far more than her opponent, Westminster City Councilwoman Joy 
L. Neugebauer, but Wieder's campaign declined to make her latest financial 
figures available Friday, the postmark deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer has raised $23,470 and had $6,895.41 cash on hand as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm counting on the grass-roots support I've been getting to carry me 
through," Neugebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the district attorney's race, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright has 
bridged the campaign contribution gap considerably against appointed incumbent 
Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi ran away from his three opponents in campaign contributions in the June 
primary, raising three times as much as all of them together. Capizzi raised 
$140,541 for the June race; he has since added $81,705 in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Enright raised just $18,102 for the primary. However, since placing second to 
Capizzi in the four-man race and forcing a runoff, he has raised another 
$51,324.

CRASH KILLS WOMAN AFTER BIRTHDAY PARTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old Anaheim woman who had just celebrated her birthday with friends 
died in an early morning car crash Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Hrifko spent Thursday evening celebrating with friends at a restaurant in 
Newport Beach and was driving her 1985 Nissan 300 SX, loaded with presents and 
flowers, home when she lost control and hit a tree at about 12:15 a.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was on the northbound San Diego Freeway off-ramp at Brookhurst Street 
when her car veered to the left, said California Highway Patrol Officer Lyle 
Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
When she tried to straighten the car out, she overcompensated and ran off the 
right side, hitting a tree, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found a broken, unlit cigarette on the seat of the car and believe 
Hrifko may have been distracted trying to light it when she veered off the 
off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
"She was going much too fast in order to take that ramp safely," Whitten said, 
estimating her speed at 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like something distracted her attention. She may have been reaching 
for a match when she hit the curb, then just overcompensated to the right. 
There was no other visible reason why she couldn't have stayed in control," 
Whitten said. LUCY CHABOT

INCUMBENTS LEAD IN FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbents in this year's city election are raising and spending more money 
than their challengers, according to mandatory campaign finance reports filed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young, who faces one other candidate for the two-year mayoral 
term, and three incumbent council members who face challenges from five 
candidates, have each raised more than $40,000 to fund their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Richards L. Norton, who faces two challengers, leads all fund raising 
with $94,743. Most of the money came to Friends of Rick Norton, which has 
raised $83,996. The remaining $10,747 was raised by a separate committee to 
reelect Norton. 
</P>
<P>
Young reported raising $84,631, incumbent Ron May showed $48,862 in receipts 
and incumbent Miguel A. Pulido Jr. listed $42,432. 
</P>
<P>
Two of May's biggest contributors were the Santa Ana Firemen's and the Santa 
Ana Police Officers' political action committees. Their contributions total 
$8,500 to date. 
</P>
<P>
May was part of a council majority who initially urged the council not to pass 
the city's annual budget until contract negotiations with both the police and 
fire unions were completed. May changed his mind two weeks later, however, and 
voted to approve the budget before the contracts were settled. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido's opponent, Coween Dickerson, received a $5,000 contribution from the 
Santa Ana Police Officers' PAC. She has so far raised a total of $6,933. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Robert L. Richardson is the leading fund-raiser among 
challengers with $25,591. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of two candidates trying to unseat May. Glenn Mondo, who is 
challenging Norton, and mayoral candidate Richard Moser have each raised less 
than $5,000. Pulido leads in expenditures with $46,437. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Martinez-Griffiths, who is challenging Norton, and Robert Banuelos, who 
is running against May, did not file reports Friday. GREG HERNANDEZ

AGENCIES REQUEST BIDS FOR 2 TOLLWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's toll road agencies solicited bids Friday from four firms 
competing for contracts to design and build two county tollways. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Corridor Agencies, which are overseeing the projects, sent 
the bid forms to a joint venture of Penni Corp. and Guy F. Atkinson Co., 
Ohbayashi Corp., California Corridor Construction (a consortium of Kiewit 
Pacific Co., Granite Construction Co. and De Leuw Cather &amp; Co.), and 
Morrison Knudsen Corp. The bids will involve the San Joaquin Hills and Eastern 
tollways, which are estimated to cost more than $1.3 billion combined. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Hills tollway is an extension of California 73 from Newport 
Beach through the coastal hills to Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano. The 
Eastern tollway is a new route from the Riverside Freeway near Weir Canyon 
through the mountains to the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Hills project is scheduled to be built first, with selection of 
a firm for construction due in February. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

POLICE STUMPED AFTER SEARCH FOR WOMAN;

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are still searching for a mentally disabled woman who was last seen more 
than a week ago walking her school-age cousin to a junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
Despite conducting an extensive search for 20-year-old Tufa Petelo since she 
was reported missing on Sept. 26 by her aunt, investigators have been unable to 
come up with a single clue, Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to find her," Hedgpeth said. "Now we're really starting 
to get concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said that police and Petelo's aunt, Sutatia Tausili, with whom she 
lives, were particularly disturbed by the young woman's disappearance because 
she has the mental capacity of a 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of her disappearance, Petelo was seen walking with her cousin to 
Brookhurst Junior High on Brookhurst Street about 7 a.m., Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are assuming she was returning home," Hedgpeth said. "She has not been seen 
since." 
</P>
<P>
Petelo routinely walked the path, which included a long stretch alongside a 
"remote" flood control channel, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made several searches for her in that area," Hedgpeth said. "We've 
canvassed the area and walked the flood control channel. We've had no success." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, teams of detectives passed out 400 flyers bearing her picture and 
physical description to residents living in the neighborhoods near the flood 
control channel, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, members of the department's juvenile detail were back out in the 
area, searching through ditches and bushes for any sign of the woman. 
Detectives have also contacted the Adam Walsh Center, which publicizes and 
catalogues missing children nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Petelo is described as a Samoan with a wide-bridged nose and a false tooth on 
the upper left side of her mouth. She is 5-foot-2 and weighs 138 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
She was wearing blue, knee-length pants, a red shirt and a black-and-white 
sweater when she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the missing woman is asked to call Anaheim police 
at (714) 999-1947.

RILEY WON'T BACK WIEDER, CITES HER OPPOSITION TO MEASURE M

Breaking a tradition of reciprocal endorsements, Orange County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley said Friday that he would not support the reelection bid of 
board colleague Harriett M. Wieder because of her opposition to Measure M, the 
transportation sales-tax initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion it (Measure M) is one of the most essential measures to the 
county in its history," Riley said in an interview. "I strongly believe that it 
is essential for Measure M to pass, and I cannot support somebody who doesn't 
have that same belief." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder supported Measure M when it was defeated last November, and had 
continued her support until last June, when she was forced into a runoff with 
Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder was unavailable for comment Friday. She has said she believes the 
measure is good, but that the strong voter opposition to it in her district 
made it bad public policy and bad politics to support it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a time to lead and a time to be led," Wieder said in a recent 
interview. "I don't need to be hit on the head. . . . I think the voters have 
already told me: Oppose Measure M." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said that "traditionally," the five supervisors support each other's 
campaigns by allowing their names to be used on endorsement lists or other 
campaign literature, but he will not allow Wieder to use his name this fall. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, he will not actively oppose Wieder, because her 
opponent, Neugebauer, also opposes Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Harriett, and she knows that I am not supporting her. But I am not 
supporting any other candidate, and she would be my choice of the two." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Riley, if Measure M is so unpopular in Wieder's 2nd district, 
"maybe my not supporting her will be a plus for her."

2 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN BROADWAY THEFT; 
</P>
<P>
ROBBERY: THE MEN SMASH THROUGH THE JEWELRY SECTION OF THE SOUTH COAST PLAZA 
STORE AND FLEE WITH POLICE IN PURSUIT. THEY ARE CAUGHT AFTER A HIGH-SPEED

<P>
Two men who allegedly smashed through a jewelry counter at a Broadway 
department store and then fled with police in pursuit were arrested after a 
high-speed chase along the San Diego Freeway, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 9 p.m. Thursday theft at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, during which 
two robbers allegedly used a "wooden sledgehammer" to smash glass-topped 
jewelry cases, was the third such attack at the shopping center this year, 
Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Mike Millington said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Eric C. Brown, 28, and Martin F. Miles, 24, both of Los Angeles. 
They were being held on $10,000 bail each in Costa Mesa Jail, Police Lt. Sam 
Cordero said. Brown and Miles will face commercial burglary charges at a Monday 
arraignment at Harbor Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero said that just as employees of the Broadway at Crystal Court were about 
to close Thursday night, two men ran to the jewelry section with a sledgehammer 
and began breaking apart the glass cases. 
</P>
<P>
They then fled the store with thousands of dollars worth of jewelry, jumped 
into a gray Buick and sped off, Cordero said. But before they left the parking 
lot, security guards in pursuit saw the pair abandon the Buick, jump into a tan 
Chevrolet and head for the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Cordero speculated the suspects drove both cars to the parking lot and had 
planned to switch cars during the escape. He said both cars had been reported 
stolen in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the suspects) apparently arrived separately," Cordero said. "Switching 
cars like that is common. That's the system." 
</P>
<P>
A police unit responding to the call chased the Chevrolet on the northbound 
freeway at high speeds to the Valley View exit, where the driver lost control 
on the off-ramp and spun to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa police officers quickly arrested the driver, later identified as 
Brown, but were unable to catch the passenger. A short time later, a Cypress 
police canine unit spotted a man, later identified as Miles, who matched the 
description provided by the South Coast Plaza security guards. He was arrested 
without a struggle, Cordero said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said jewelry was recovered from the men.

SAFETY SHOWERS WERE IN UCI LAB DESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: 'REGRETTABLE' DELAY IN INSTALLATION LED TO BUILDING'S OPENING BEFORE 
THEY WERE DONE. A STUDENT BADLY BURNED BY ACID RAN PAST THE BACKUP SYSTEM.

<P>
A UC Irvine environmental health official said Friday that safety showers were 
included in the original design for the Physical Science Building, where a 
graduate student was seriously burned by spilled chemicals, but that there was 
a "regrettable" delay in their installation. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Smirl, director of environmental health and safety, said the design for 
the building called for the overhead safety showers but they were not fully 
installed when the building was occupied in August. Installation of the shower 
drains began several weeks before the building opened, and workers now are 
laboring "feverishly" to finish putting the showers in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The incomplete installation of the state-required showers was noticed when the 
building was inspected before its opening, Smirl said. Still, the backup system 
of hand-held "drench hoses" placed at every lab sink -- and instruction about 
their use during a four-hour safety course required for all students and staff 
-- was considered adequate protection while the shower installation continued, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
This backup system provides three or four drench hoses in each lab, while the 
overhead showers will number one per wing, Smirl said. "Any implication that 
the buildings are substandard is inaccurate," he said. "Our system was not 
foolproof but it was sufficient. . . . The breakdown occurred when the student 
panicked." 
</P>
<P>
The graduate student, Kate Sorenson, sustained first- and second-degree burns 
on her legs Sept. 23 when she spilled nitric acid while using the corrosive 
chemical as a cleaning agent. She has said she did not follow certain safety 
procedures, such as wearing a protective apron. While the drench hose was close 
at hand, her first instinct was to run for a safety shower, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of an inorganic chemistry team that came to UCI this summer with Prof. 
Nancy Doherty from the University of Washington in Seattle, Sorenson had gone 
through the safety course a week earlier. New to Irvine, she was accustomed to 
running to the safety showers, and forgot to reach for the pull-out nozzles at 
the sink when the spill occurred, she said. Finding no overhead shower, she ran 
next door and was hosed down by someone in another lab, she said. 
</P>
<P>
State codes require overhead showers, which can be activated by the single push 
of a button or pull of a handle, to be located every 100 feet -- or no farther 
than 10 seconds away -- in laboratories. That standard will result in one 
shower on each of the five floors of the laboratories, Smirl said. The drench 
hoses, while located closer in the labs, must be held by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Smirl said the University of California system is one of the few in the nation 
that requires an extensive safety training course for laboratory students. 
</P>
<P>
"Our accident record in laboratory safety has been excellent in the university 
system," Smirl said. "We would have liked the showers to have been in when the 
building was occupied . . . but we did have a backup."

WYCHE ACCUSTOMED TO CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE BENGALS' IMPASSIONED COACH HAS BEEN THROUGH THE MEDIA'S 
THREE-RING CIRCUS A NUMBER OF TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Wyche -- the man who wears a Cincinnati Bengals' logo on his hat and his 
heart on his sleeve -- is making headlines again. 
</P>
<P>
And he thought the media scrutiny had reached its peak in 1987, when he called 
a sweep to run out the last six seconds of a game against the 49ers. James 
Brooks was thrown for a loss on the play and Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass 
with two seconds left to beat the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the impassioned Bengal coach has touched off a debate that 
has gone far beyond the sports pages. Wyche is accustomed to dealing with 
Sports Illustrated and ESPN, but now he's under fire in Time magazine and on 
"Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche barred a female reporter, USA Today's Denise Tom, from the Bengals' 
locker room Monday night after Cincinnati lost to Seattle. Friday, he found out 
it cost him about $30,000, the largest fine levied against an NFL coach. 
</P>
<P>
But before dismissing Wyche as nothing but a macho Neanderthal, consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- This is a man who often drives his children, Zak, 19, and Kerry, 17, 
through the inner-city wastelands of Cincinnati to remind them just how lucky 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This is a man who still has the cat he rescued from the grip of a boy who 
was swinging it by the tail during one of those trips. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This is a man who assigned black and white players as roommates in training 
camp in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This is a man who not only finds time, even during the NFL season, to raise 
money for Cincinnati's homeless (he donates the revenues from his $5,000-a-pop 
speaking engagements), but he also finds the time on Saturdays before home 
games to pass out blankets and clothing at a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche is certainly complex. To some, he's one of the most innovative, bold, 
dynamic coaches in the game. Others say he's a bit schizophrenic. Perhaps the 
nickname pinned on him by a Pittsburgh Steeler assistant -- "Wicky Wacky Wyche" 
-- says it best. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe most coaches and members of the media agree that the current system of 
postgame locker-room interviews works. Maybe most think shy players can almost 
always preserve their modesty by employing a well-placed towel. And maybe most 
coaches just accept these kinds of league policies, preferring to spend their 
time worrying about Xs and O's. 
</P>
<P>
Not Wyche, who says he has received a lot of complaints from his players who 
don't feel comfortable unclothed in the company of women other than their 
wives. And if Wyche is anything, he's loyal. He sticks by his players . . . 
even when he has no good reason to. 
</P>
<P>
He once questioned police tactics in searching a player (even though they 
discovered a concealed weapon). And he once slammed the locker-room door on the 
hand of a deputy sheriff who was trying to serve papers on a Bengal player in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
So now Wyche has decided to divert some of his considerable energies and 
intellect in an attempt to revise the rules about women in the 
work/showering/dressing place. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, believe me, at the time it happened, I had no idea there was 
anything to it," Wyche said. "I didn't even know this was an incident until 
after I started getting phone calls that lasted until 2 a.m. I wasn't trying to 
skirt any rules, confront anyone or make any statements." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche says he was merely attempting to protect the privacy of his players and 
at the same time ensure Tom got the opportunity to talk to any player she 
wanted to. He says she only requested to interview quarterback Boomer Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going out of my way to be extra courteous to this one lady and there was 
only one," he said. "She got personal attention from the head coach. I can't 
recall ever saying, 'Just a second, I'll run and get our star quarterback for a 
private interview,' to a reporter before. 
</P>
<P>
"This lady got her audience immediately, she got a personal escort from the 
head coach and a courteous quarterback who was willing to spend as much time as 
she wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the incident has turned into a full-blown issue, don't expect Wyche to 
back down. He says no amount of fine will "force me to change my conviction on 
this matter." He's dared to question and risked ridicule in the past, and the 
Bengals, at least, love him for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on this team admires that he will always stick up for the players, 
regardless what the situation is," Esiason said. "Right now, he's trying to 
shield the team the best he can. I don't envy the situation he's in. He's got 
to be a little frayed. I hope he weathers the storm." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche might or might not have known he was creating an incident, but now that 
the issue is being discussed, he's focusing on what he feels is a cause worthy 
of his attention. So what's a little distraction in the middle of the season? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time we reconsidered the system," he said. "I know the spirit of 
the law is much more important than the letter of the law. There are 100 ways 
to conduct an interview and the least convenient is to do it naked. We'll find 
a better system. 
</P>
<P>
"And down the road this episode will mean there will be more female 
sportswriters. There's bound to be a percentage of women who don't even take it 
on because they have to hang around a bunch of guys in jocks. This will give 
some talented writers a chance to enter the industry who have never even 
considered it before. 
</P>
<P>
"This has never been a case of accessibility. You know me. I'm available. In 
fact, I'm probably talking too much again now." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche admits he has a tendency to let frankness overtake tact. Clearly, he's no 
Tom Landry, on the field or off. He's about as stoic as a guy who knows he won 
the lottery but can't find his winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Another list: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After humiliating the Houston Oilers and their coach, longtime rival Jerry 
Glanville, 61-7, last season, an excited Wyche said he wished there had been a 
fifth quarter so the Bengals could have scored 100 points. Then he described 
the Oilers as "sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the crowd at Riverfront Stadium began hurling iceballs at the Seahawks 
during the closing minutes of a 24-17 Bengals' loss last season, Wyche grabbed 
a public-address microphone and screamed, "You don't live in Cleveland; you 
live in Cincinnati." (After the chastisement, the only snow in the air was in 
flake form). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then he was fined $3,000 for barring reporters from the Bengal locker room 
after that loss to the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After a tough defeat in Denver in 1986, Wyche kicked the door on his way 
into his postgame press conference. When a traffic reporter, who was 
moonlighting on weekends for National Public Radio, asked him why he kicked the 
door, Wyche jumped down from the podium, grabbed the reporter's microphone and 
threw it in his face. (After an apology, no charges were filed, but Wyche was 
fined $2,000 for this one). 
</P>
<P>
"You know Sam, he's always been a very emotional coach," Esiason said. "I think 
that's one of the reasons the players really play for him, because he's always 
taking stands." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, in the waning minutes of the 31-16 loss to Seattle, Wyche 
gathered his offensive players into a huddle. This was not to be a strategy 
planning session -- the cause was already lost on this evening -- it was to be 
a damage-control pep talk from a coach who couldn't wait until the final gun to 
begin to exorcise the pain of an embarrassing defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stinking the house up and we're just not like that," Wyche said. "I 
just got everybody together and said, 'I want everyone one to look each other 
in the eye. We're going to lock knuckles here and I don't want one guy out of 
the circle.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'We're through with it. We're tired of looking bad, of missing blocks, 
of incompleting passes, of fumbling exchanges.' I said, 'Look at yourself and 
each other. Now, it's over.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wyche's innovative offense is certainly one of the league's best and Monday 
night's performance should soon be just a bad memory. His little war of the 
sexes with the NFL may just be beginning, however.

Troy High School has half as many students as Rialto Eisenhower, and Friday 
night the Warriors learned why smaller schools shouldn't schedule football 
games against larger schools.

Eisenhower, the fourth-ranked team in the Southern Section's Division I, 
thoroughly dominated Troy at Fullerton High, winning 28-0 in the final 
nonleague game for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Eisenhower Coach Tom Hoak said the Eagles (5-0) didn't play very well. 
Hoak said his team may have been overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we were aggressive," Hoak said. "I thought they were more 
aggressive than us." 
</P>
<P>
But Troy (2-3) didn't have the athletes to keep pace, as was evident on 
Eisenhower's first drive. 
</P>
<P>
After Omar Love, the Eagles' leading rusher entering the game, returned the 
kickoff 37 yards, Eisenhower's second-leading rusher, Anthony Stewart, carried 
the ball four times for 17 yards. Quarterback Jason Davis then completed two 
passes -- one for eight yards to Demond Thompkins and one to Robert Talley for 
a 32-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Talley was well-covered by the Troy secondary but outjumped his defender for 
the ball. After a two-point conversion, Eisenhower led 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles scored twice more in the first half to take a 21-0 lead. Stewart 
scored on a two-yard run and Davis threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Thompkins. 
</P>
<P>
Troy slowed down Eisenhower's running attack but never completely shut it down. 
One had the feeling Eagle running backs were often only a step away from 
breaking into the open for long runs, but none ever did. 
</P>
<P>
All totalled, 10 Eisenhower players carried the ball, rushing 27 times for 143 
yards. Only twice was an Eagle runner held to less than a one-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
Davis completed 14 of 21 passes for 164 yards and three touchdowns, including 
the Eagles' final score -- a 44-yard pass to Talley in the third quarter for a 
28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Troy tried to establish its ground game with Bryant Burchit, a sophomore 
playing his first varsity game at running back. But Burchit gained only 24 
yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Warrior quarterback Greg Windle had a little more success, completing 13 of 24 
passes for 122 yards, but Troy was never able to sustain a drive. 
</P>
<P>
Troy's original opponent for Friday's game backed out, and three other schools 
declined to play the Warriors, Troy Coach John Turek said. 
</P>
<P>
Turek called Hoak last spring and Hoak agreed to have his team fill the empty 
spot on Troy's schedule.

Garden Grove High School's Adrian Ioja kicked a 26-yard field goal with 11 
seconds left Friday to give the Argonauts a 6-3 victory over Santiago in a 
Garden Grove League game. 
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes after Santiago's Dan Agramont kicked a 32-yard field goal at the 
start of the second quarter, Ioja tied the game with a 36-yarder of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team was able to score again until the fourth quarter. Garden Grove 
quarterback Simon Fuentes (three of seven for 56 yards) marched the Argonauts 
(2-3 overall, 1-1 in league) for four first downs and got them within 
field-goal range, but Ioja missed a 38-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Fuentes nor Ioja was through. With less than a minute left in the 
game, Fuentes hit wide receiver Jason Baca with a 36-yard pass, and Santiago 
(1-4, 1-1)was called for a face-mask penalty. Three plays later, Ioja redeemed 
himself with the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense finally showed up for a ballgame," said Buenafe. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove defense held quarterback Mike Carrasco to five completions in 
15 attempts for 57 yards and an interception and minus-26 yards rushing, 
Santiago carried for just 11 yards.HEATHER SMALLEY

RANCHO ALAMITOS' TRAMMELL RUNS FOR 244 YARDS, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS

It was a night for pageantry at the Rancho Alamitos High School homecoming game 
Friday, so Vaquero tailback Ulysses Trammell decided to put on a show of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell rushed for 244 yards in 20 carries and scored four touchdowns to lead 
Rancho Alamitos over Kennedy, 34-12, in front of about 1,500 at Bolsa Grande 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Ulysses Trammell saved our bacon," Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
That he did. 
</P>
<P>
The senior scored on a 60-yard run the first time he touched the ball and later 
on runs of 52, one and 24 yards, breaking would-be tacklers numerous times. He 
had 95 yards in six carries in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rancho Alamitos (5-0 overall, 2-0 in league) could not come up with 
much of an offensive output in the first half and held a 7-6 margin at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros were stunned on Kennedy's first possession of the game when 
quarterback John Guthrie connected with wide receiver Rod Rosales on a 51-yard 
pass play to give the Fighting Irish the early lead with 8 minutes 34 seconds 
left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho didn't help its cause by being penalized for 80 yards in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Trammell took control in the second half to bail out the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
He set up his second touchdown with a 26-yard run midway through the third 
period and then ran the ball four times in a six-play drive a couple of minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (2-3, 0-2) could not capitalize on Rancho's penalties and had to settle 
for only one more touchdown, on a five-yard pass from Guthrie to tailback Vince 
Church with 5:31 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros wrapped up their scoring with a five-yard run by Leon Vickers 
early in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho held Church to 60 yards in 14 carries. Guthrie completed seven of 16 
passes for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The victory almost proved costly for the Vaqueros, however. Senior 
fullback/tackle Vince Otteman suffered what originally was believed to be 
possible torn ligaments in a knee on his first carry of the game, but Vicki 
McAdams, a physician's assistant at Kaiser Permanente in Anaheim, said the 
injury was diagnosed as a knee strain.

Both Valencia and Fullerton high schools came into Friday night's game 
undefeated, but the suspense came out of the game in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia's Ryan Roskelly took the opening kickoff back 71 yards, setting up 
quarterback Marc O'Brien's four-yard touchdown run. Valencia scored on its 
first four possessions en route to a 35-0 rout at Bradford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate that we've got a lot of backs that can run and some linemen 
who can block," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (5-0) has outscored its opponents, 185-31, this season. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien moved Valencia 91 yards in 12 plays on its second drive of the first 
quarter, then he capped the march with a one-yard scoring plunge over the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
It took O'Brien six plays to find the end zone again after Valencia's Dave 
Sanchez intercepted a Daniel Chacon pass at the Fullerton 32-yard line. O'Brien 
scored his third touchdown of the night on a three-yard sneak with 9 minutes 56 
seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was Roskelly's turn. With 5:23 left in the half, the junior tailback 
went around left end 22 yards for a touchdown and a 28-0 Valencia lead. 
</P>
<P>
Roskelly finished the scoring early in the third quarter, snaking into the end 
zone from six yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Roskelly carried only six times for 64 yards. Valencia also got 67 yards in 17 
carries from halfback John Fewell, and 46 yards in eight attempts from tailback 
Willie Barnes, but Marrujo pulled most of his starters from the game with two 
minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, the Chacon twins were unable to bring Fullerton (4-1) back 
from the brink. Daniel Chacon was held to 94 yards passing, and brother David 
gained only 14 yards rushing and 56 receiving. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fullback D.C. Olsen was held to 23 yards.

Savanna High School blocked a 25-yard field goal attempt by Laguna Hills' Marc 
Brodbeck with seven seconds remaining in the game to preserve a 7-7 tie Friday 
night at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels' (3-1-1) defensive front penetrated the Hawks' offensive line and 
several players smothered Brodbeck's low kick. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills (3-1-1) moved the ball into field goal position after Mark 
Bochenek recovered a fumble by Savanna's Randall Morgan at the Rebel 44-yard 
line with 1:52 left. Marwan Saba gained 14 yards in two running plays, and then 
quarterback Casey Sullivan hit tight end Kirk Brown for a 19-yard gain to the 
Savanna 10 with 16 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
An off-tackle run by Saba moved the ball into the middle of the field at the 
eight, but the blocked kick ended Laguna Hills' would-be winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on Jeff Ragos' one-yard touchdown 
run. Ragos' score capped a 34-yard drive that was set up by Hien Nguyen's 
19-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills tied the score in the third quarter. Savanna fumbled away the ball 
at its 23-yard line. Saba finished the eight-play drive with a one-yard 
touchdown run with 4:21 left in the quarter.

Quarterback Jason Luevanos threw for three touchdowns and rushed for another to 
lead Brea-Olinda High School to a 33-17 victory over El Dorado Friday night in 
a nonleague football game at Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Irvin accounted for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
His one-yard run with 7:08 left gave Brea (3-2) a 26-10 lead. He also caught a 
four-yard scoring pass from Luevanos with 1:22 left for the final score. 
</P>
<P>
After El Dorado (1-4) took a 3-0 lead in the first quarter on a 26-yard field 
goal by Mike Roth, Brea took a 7-3 lead as Luevanos escaped a pass rush and 
raced 24 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado took a 10-7 lead on a one-yard scoring run by Eric Ayala with almost 
seven minutes left in the half on fourth and goal. 
</P>
<P>
Brea regained the lead for good with 1:30 left in the half after Lance Gasporra 
recovered an El Dorado fumble at the Golden Hawk 29. Three plays later, 
Luevanos completed a three-yard touchdown pass to Jamie Baraglia. Brea led, 
13-10, after the extra-point try was missed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team scored in the third quarter, but with 9:16 left in the game, 
Luevanos completed a five-yard touchdown to Mike Ryan and Brea led, 20-10. DALE

Senior quarterback Steve Walker completed 10 of 17 passes for 132 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead Newport Harbor High School to a 31-7 victory over Estancia 
Friday night at Newport Harbor. 
</P>

Marc Tagliaferri, a 6-foot-3, 180-pound running back, added 105 yards and a 
touchdown in 13 carries for the Sailors (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor broke the game open with 2:42 left in the first half when Walker 
hit senior tight end George Greenwalt with a 25-yard touchdown pass. Josh 
Klein's extra point made it 14-7 Newport Harbor. On the next series, junior 
linebacker Darin Mangnall recovered a fumble at the Estancia 17-yard line. Two 
plays later, Walker and junior wide receiver Branon Coluccio teamed on a 
four-yard touchdown pass with 1:26 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Klein added a 44-yard field goal as time ran out in the half to give Newport

Cypress High School scored three times in the fourth quarter and held off 
Magnolia's rally to post a 28-19 nonleague victory Friday at Handel Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kakalia's 23-yard interception return with 1:10 to play sealed the victory 
after Magnolia's Ariel Couvetier made the score 21-19 on a 98-yard kickoff 
return with five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-yard pass from Gabe Garcia to Yousef Seeman and a 29-yard run by Bryan 
Dawson accounted for Cypress' other second-half scores. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia (1-4) scored on a 60-yard fumble return by John Garcia with 3:08 to 
play in the third quarter for the Sentinels' first touchdown in four games. 
Early in the fourth quarter, Magnolia took a 12-7 lead on a one-yard run by 
Couvetier set up by a Cypress fumble. But the Centurions came right back on a 
six-play, 80-yard drive capped by Seeman's touchdown reception with 10:25 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (2-3) had a strong defensive effort that held Magnolia to 115 total 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Joe Groover opened the scoring with a six-yard 
pass from Garcia that capped a 10-play, 61-yard drive with 5:52 left in the

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK: SCC HOPES VOLLEYBALL SLIDE IS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California College women's volleyball Coach Becky Pines hopes a 
five-game victory Tuesday over Christ College Irvine has stopped her team's 
midseason slide. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Vanguards' first victory in five Golden State Athletic Conference 
matches this season and only their second in the past 10 matches. 
</P>
<P>
All this after SCC began the season -- Pines' second as coach -- 12-5 and 
appeared ready to challenge the top teams in the conference. The Vanguards 
defeated NCAA Division II schools Humboldt State and Cal State Stanislaus, won 
the Whittier College Tournament and twice won a game from Cal Poly Pomona, the 
sixth-ranked team in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards' extended slump started in Hawaii against some tough competition. 
They lost four matches in four days, the final coming against Hawaii Hilo, 
which is ranked fourth in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics poll. 
</P>
<P>
"We really had hoped after Hawaii that we would start dominating in conference 
play," Pines said. "I have to give some credit to our conference opponents 
because they're strong, but we're in a slump." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State Athletic Conference has one of the strongest fields at its 
level. Fresno Pacific, defending NAIA champion, is ranked fifth in the latest 
poll and two other conference teams -- Azusa Pacific and Westmont -- are ranked 
in the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we could do great at nationals if we could get past our conference," 
Pines said. 
</P>
<P>
If SCC is to continue its rebound, it must get strong play from middle blockers 
Heather Frewin and Leslie Lastrapes and outside hitter Krista Hoover. Frewin 
and Hoover, a junior from El Dorado High School, each had 15 kills in the 
Vanguards' victory over Christ College. Lastrapes had 14 kills and 23 digs. 
</P>
<P>
After a District 3 match Friday at Biola, the Vanguards (14-13, 1-4 in the 
conference) meet Westmont at 7:30 tonight at Santa Barbara City College. 
Westmont, ranked 18th in the NAIA, also has had trouble in the conference, 
losing its first three matches, before defeating Christ College Irvine in three 
games Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin Durham, a former SCC, Golden West College and Bolsa Grande High School 
basketball player, has signed a contract to play for the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
Durham, who in two seasons (1983-84 and 1984-85) as SCC's point guard, was 
twice an all-district player and an honorable mention All-American in 1985 
after averaging 14.9 points and a district-leading 8.8 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
The past few years, the 5-foot-11 Durham has been playing with the Shooting 
Stars, Meadowlark Lemon's touring team, SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone used to call him mini-Magic at SCC -- just a slight difference in 
size and ability -- but he had a big smile and an infectious personality," 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Chapman tennis players have earned a shot at a national championship after 
winning titles at the Division II ITCA/Rolex Southern California championships 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zuercher won the singles championship and joined Laurent Dropsy to win the 
doubles title Sunday at Cal Poly Pomona. The players qualified for the national 
championships in February at Corpus Christi, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Zuercher, who was ranked No. 18 in Division II at the end of last season, 
defeated Cal Poly Pomona's Juan Garcia, 6-0, 7-6 (7-3), in the final to become 
the first Chapman player to win the Southern California title since Miles

Christ College Irvine volleyball player Miriam Paulus, who was named the NAIA 
District 3 player of the week last week, had 22 kills in 27 attempts in the 
Eagles' loss to SCC Tuesday. Her .741 attack percentage set a Christ College 
single-game record and she leads the district with 193 kills. . . . The Chapman 
women's volleyball team, ranked No. 13 in the nation, opened its California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. season Tuesday with a three-game loss to No. 6 Cal 
Poly Pomona. The Panthers (13-9, 0-1) lost, 15-8, 15-11, 16-14.

TITANS FACE TWO TOUGH FOES TONIGHT -- UNLV, THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Containing Nevada Las Vegas' option offense, which totalled 628 yards in last 
week's 37-28 victory over the University of the Pacific, will be a formidable 
task for Cal State Fullerton. The Titans have allowed an average of 421 yards 
and 35 points per game this season. 
</P>
<P>
But to have any success in tonight's Big West Conference game, the Titans must 
overcome a more lethal adversary. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to eliminate our most feared opponent -- ourselves," Fullerton Coach 
Gene Murphy said. "If we can conquer ourselves, we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
These Titans have been a masochistic bunch in the past three weeks. They have 
turned the ball over 16 times in three games, including six in last week's 38-3 
loss to Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the turnovers have been self-induced -- the quarterback fumbles the 
snap from center or throws an interception into heavy coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the turnovers have come at the worst time -- either near the opponent's 
end zone or deep in Titan territory. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the turnovers have triggered momentum swings -- 10 times after a Titan 
turnover, the opponent has scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mistakes can be attributed to a lack of concentration, some to 
inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go a whole week in practice and not have one bad center snap," Murphy 
said. "But it's a little different when you line up in front of 30,000 fans in 
your first conference game." 
</P>
<P>
If the Titans can eliminate or at least reduce their mistakes, though, they 
should be able to rack up some points tonight. When describing the Las Vegas 
defense, the word "stingy" doesn't exactly come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels have been vulnerable to the run, allowing an average of 203.8 yards 
per game. They have been vulnerable to the pass, allowing an average of 241.4 
yards per game. They have allowed an average of 32.6 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
In short, this is a below-average defensive unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think we're out there with six or seven guys," said Jim Strong, 
UNLV's first-year coach. "I don't know why, but it seems like the other team 
has more guys on offense than we have on defense. Wide receivers are always 
open, running backs are in our secondary. Whenever a safety is your leading 
tackler, that concerns you." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has been able to move the ball this season, averaging 361.2 yards per 
game. Excluding his eight interceptions, senior quarterback Paul Schulte has 
had a decent season, completing 61 of 127 passes for 991 yards and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Reggie Yarbrough has 486 yards and four touchdowns in 103 carries, 
and receivers J.J. Celestine (20 catches, 334 yards) and Richard Harrison (17 
catches, 327 yards) are having solid seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But at times, the end zone has seemed like a repellent to the Titans. Receivers 
who have caught passes behind the secondary have been caught from behind by 
defensive backs, and Fullerton has turned the ball over too often on its final 
approach to the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Titans had 402 total yards, and all they had to show for it was 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton hasn't been a Titan of defense this season, either, and facing an 
explosive Rebel offense, the Titans will be without their best defensive 
player, linebacker Clarence Siler. Siler injured his knee and ankle last week 
and is out for three to four games. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's offense relies on deception, with quarterback Derek Stott running the 
option with fullback Marvin Eastman and tailback Teddy James. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rebel offense is not to be confused with Oklahoma's run-at-all-costs 
wishbone -- Stott averages 22 passes per game and last week completed 21 of 28 
attempts for 280 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV also has an outstanding all-round threat in flanker-quarterback-return 
specialist Hunkie Cooper, who ranks seventh in the nation in all-purpose yards 
per game with a 163.8 average. Cooper plays quarterback in many short-yardage 
situations and may also play some defensive back tonight, Strong said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a talented team," Fullerton defensive coordinator Kirk Harmon said. 
"Even if you run up 628 yards against air, you're pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will be without defensive tackle Dave Dorf, who injured knee 
ligaments in practice this week and will miss two to four games. If you're 
keeping track, that's 10 starters who have missed action because of injuries 
this season, including four who will not play tonight. But don't look for any 
sympathy from UNLV Coach Jim Strong. The Rebels have lost 11 starters to 
injuries this season. In fact, Strong has become so desperate that he is 
considering playing three players, Hunkie Cooper, John Ma'ae and on both 
offense and defense. . . . UNLV leads the series, 10-4, but Fullerton has won 
the past three games. . . . Titan receiver J.J. Celestine, who also returns 
kickoffs, ranks 17th in the nation in all-purpose yardage with an average of 
143.6 per game.

TWO VIEWS ON NEW KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who said that New Kids music isn't going to last? Who said New Kids are sweet 
but sad? 
</P>
<P>
Well I would like to know! 
</P>
<P>
Either that person's real jealous or he doesn't know what he is talking about! 
Did anyone say that about the Beatles? Did anyone say that about Buddy Holly or 
Elvis? What happened to them? 
</P>
<P>
And about Donnie! When he was wearing a "Drugs Suck" T-shirt, would you rather 
him have a "Drugs are Cool" T-shirt on? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you just don't like their music for some strange reason. Well that's all 
right. Just don't try to get other people to not like them too! 
</P>
<P>
Do you think people like New Kids are a dime a dozen? Well, here! The next 
dozen is on me! (Editors's note: A dime was enclosed with this letter.) 
</P>
<P>
Where's that dozen now that you got your dime?

CITY ADOPTED THE BARD, NOW FORSAKES HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grove Shakespeare Festival approached the City Council of Garden Grove for 
assistance out of desperation, a desperation to fulfill a commitment made by 
the trustees and volunteers of the Grove Shakespeare Festival to the people of 
Garden Grove -- and their representatives, the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to remember that this theater began as a civic operation: The 
city established the theater, hired the original staff, appointed the trustees 
and built the complex. Why? As a promotional effort for the revitalization of 
central Garden Grove, to help change the image from "Garbage Grove." 
Additionally, by improving the quality of life in this city, business might be 
attracted and people would move back to the center of town. There was not a 
band of wild and crazy "arts types" demanding that Shakespeare be given a home. 
There was instead a city manager with vision and a council willing to fund and 
support the effort, a council that approved a specific plan for revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
There was a master plan for the Main Street area where boutiques, movie 
theaters, the Mills House Art Gallery, additional restaurants and shops were to 
be developed to bring people to this area. But what exists today? While many 
people have moved back to this area of town, and the civic center complex has 
been completed, the Acacia restaurant, built in the early '80s, is sitting 
vacant and vandalized, the Mills House Gallery does not exist and has been 
replaced by another generic meeting center, the vacant lots that were cleared 
years ago sit vacant! The shops and boutiques designed to generate evening 
activity in the area do not exist. Expecting the theater to survive without an 
adequate restaurant for patrons is naive. How is the theater supposed to 
attract a larger audience to support itself when the city has failed to live up 
to its original plan? 
</P>
<P>
How has the theater fared over 12 seasons without anything else to attract 
audiences? Actually, quite well. In fact, you might say that the theater is the 
only part of the plan that worked. During the 1980-81 fiscal year, the city 
contributed about $124,000 in operational expenses to the theater board. By 
1985, (the amount) dropped to $67,356, and this year the council has 
contributed less than $30,000 or 5% of total operational monies. Not only has 
the theater received less fiscal support, it has eliminated such city services 
as daily maintenance, vehicle usage, printing, insurance (a $20,000 expense 
alone) and city staffing. Quite a bargain considering the national publicity 
and good will received by the city over the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
It is astonishing to me that Councilmen (Raymond T.) Littrell, (Robert F.) 
Dinsen and (J. Tilman) Williams cannot admit the great service done by this 
board of trustees. These people, and William Shakespeare, should have a statue 
erected in their honor for their diligence, hard work and service to community. 
Instead, they are made to grovel before a few self-righteous politicians who 
have created a circus of ill will by denouncing the board's efforts. These 
trustees are appointed by the City Council of Garden Grove. Yet speaking before 
Littrell, Dinsen and Williams, the council majority, is tantamount to being 
pilloried. Trustees who have lived in this city for years and have given both 
time and money to the theater are treated with appalling disrespect and 
suspicion by these men -- men who asked these people to serve as "trustees" for 
the public good. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to remind these councilmen that they built this theater and asked 
these people to breathe life into it. Do they not have a responsibility to help 
in maintaining its operations? Why have they not embraced their own blue-ribbon 
committee recommendations? Instead, they have let their prejudice against 
Shakespeare boil over into every public debate. I remind these men that 
American culture is a rich tapestry forged by an immigrant nation. I also would 
remind them that our language is English, and the greatest spokesman for the 
English language is William Shakespeare.

If controversy of any kind repels La Habra theatergoers, maybe "West Side 
Story," the next production, might be a little too much with its Puerto Ricans. 
I hope the Depot Playhouse board will realize that racism and bigotry are as 
destructive to community values as illegal drugs, domestic violence or 
political corruption.

PRYSOCK DISPLAYS BALLADEER TALENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those eager to hear familiar songs sung without untoward embellishment and 
insincere emotion -- sung, in other words, the way they're supposed to be -- 
get to the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill for a set or two of Arthur Prysock. 
</P>
<P>
During a too-short opening set Tuesday, Prysock showed his formidable talents 
as a balladeer, rendering "I'll Be Around," "Since I Fell for You," "Save Your 
Love for Me," and "When I Fall in Love" with commanding style and plaintive 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Though his vocal chops have not aged particularly well -- his burnished 
baritone has given way to a hoarse bass, his natural range diminished so 
greatly that his falsetto is needed to meet the demands of nearly every tune -- 
he still managed to deliver an appealing show. 
</P>
<P>
Much of his show's appeal belongs to his brother's quartet. Red Prysock, while 
not a particularly dynamic player of the tenor saxophone, nevertheless led the 
organ-guitar-drums ensemble capably and provided a solid musical backdrop that 
deftly supported the singer's efforts. The Prysocks' penchant for ballads must 
be genetic, as both showed a significant flair for the form, with Red Prysock 
giving his all on "A House Is Not a Home." Though the ballads are his forte, 
Arthur Prysock shone on a couple of swing outings, including "September in the 
Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Prysock and company continue at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill through Sunday. A.

'SEDUCED' GIVES POWERFUL PORTRAIT OF HUGHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Hughes, the eccentric and reclusive billionaire who was widely 
publicized for his avoidance of publicity, died on a flight from Mexico to 
Houston in 1976 without leaving a verifiable will or heir. 
</P>
<P>
But he did leave one legacy that even he couldn't avoid -- the image of a man, 
now mythlike in status, who took the American dream of fabulous wealth and used 
it to insulate himself from life for more than a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
By many accounts, the man who had everything was an orphan who lived the 
saddest and loneliest of lives: fearful of germs, fearful of people, fearful of 
the daylight, fearful of many foods and in thrall to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Hughes' death, playwright Sam Shepard came up with his 
version of the man's final days in "Seduced," now in a quietly powerful and 
disturbing production by Sledgehammer Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of calling his main character Howard Robard Hughes, Shepard named him 
Henry Malcolm Hackamore. But the outline of Hackamore's life is the same as 
Hughes'. 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer is presenting the show at the Progressive Stage Company through 
Oct. 14. And thanks to tight direction by Ethan Feerst (the executive director 
of the company) and careful attention to the text, this emerges as one of the 
most affecting productions this company has ever done. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard does not spend any time elucidating why Hackamore as an individual 
needed to control everything in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Shepard explores the desire to control as a universal impulse, 
something he suggests that we all try to do within the limits of our individual 
power and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The Sledgehammer production, nicely cast with some of San Diego's finest local 
talent, creates an eerie portrait of those hypothetical last days. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Salmon, who has made a name for himself with comic and hapless roles at 
the Bowery and the North Coast Repertory Theatres, here shows an unsuspected 
depth of command as Hackamore. It isn't easy to project power while sitting 
helplessly in a chair with an intravenous tube hooked up to one's chest. But 
Salmon does it. He speaks his commands softly and threateningly into a 
microphone, and we are not surprised to see Steve Soden as his live wire of a 
bodyguard jump to attention, without a questioning word for the most absurd and 
pathetic of requests. 
</P>
<P>
Don Loper lurks in and out wordlessly as the doctor who changes Hackamore's 
plasma. Verrier Scatolini and Susan Gelman parade and prowl stunningly as the 
two women Hackamore wants to see before he dies. 
</P>
<P>
Scatolini gets to play an elegant, faded movie star type while Gelman is a 
trampy, a onetime show girl. Both are seductively outfitted. 
</P>
<P>
Sledgehammer usually excels in set and sound design, and again, they don't 
disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
In a happy match between Vince Mountain's set design and Dan (Pea) Hicks' sound 
design, door panels whoosh upwards and fall again sharply, slicing the air like 
strokes of a guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
It's a reminder of how Hackamore sliced off so much of his life. And as a 
chilling lesson in how a refusal to live does not exempt one from death. 
</P>
<P>

In a neighborhood of manicured lawns and well-groomed flower beds, it's easy to 
spot Bart and Rosalie Palisi's Anaheim Hills home. Their yard features several 
varieties of the cacti and succulents they have nurtured from seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always loved cactus and succulents," Rosalie explained. "When we moved 
to Southern California, it made sense to try to plant something in keeping with 
the desert environment. We wanted a yard that was low maintenance, yet 
attractive. At the time we planted cacti, we weren't necessarily thinking about 
the drought; we simply wanted something to go along with our busy lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
Planting drought-resistant plants such as farrow cactus, barrel cactus and 
yucca makes sense in an era of water shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, most cacti and succulents need only a light watering about every 
two days during the summer and no watering at all in the winter," said Lloyd 
Garretson, president of the 90-member Orange County Cactus and Succulent 
Society. "This is a step in the right direction when it comes to cutting back 
on water consumption." 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners may not be ready to give up their colorful flower beds in favor 
of a more prickly display. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry, according to Garretson. "There are many flowering varieties of 
cactus and they bloom at different times of the year. You can have blossoms 
year-round if you want," he said. "Some varieties even bloom at night and close 
their buds when the sun comes up." 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,000 species in the succulent family -- cacti is the 
largest group. Other succulents include milkweed, lilies, aloe and ocotillo. 
These plants are called succulents because they store water in their leaves, 
stems and roots. Succulents are generally the smoother-skinned versions of 
their prickly cacti cousins. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are surprised to learn that hibiscus and oleanders are also 
members of the succulent family," Palisi said. "A lot of people who aren't too 
crazy about cactus because of the thorns become enamored of succulents. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we just finished planting a succulent garden for my mother, who 
doesn't care for cactus . . . but she loves succulents." 
</P>
<P>
Like most cactus lovers, the Garretsons' interest in the plants started as a 
hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a gardener," Garretson admitted. "But most of my experience 
was with fruit trees and raising vegetables. Quite frankly, I thought a lot of 
cacti were ugly. Then my wife, Toni, started getting interested in cactus 
plants and succulents and that got me going." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the yard of the Garretsons' Garden Grove home stands as testimony to 
their interest. Cacti grow in their front and back yards, and two separate 
greenhouses shelter their ever-growing collection of these hearty plants. 
</P>
<P>
"What many people don't realize is that not all cactus and succulents look 
alike," Garretson said. "There are many varieties that don't even remotely 
resemble the commonly known images. The ponytail palm and the bursera look like 
trees, while the beaver tail cactus produces a large pink flower." 
</P>
<P>
Rosalie Palisi has "what is called a pencil cactus in our yard that has very 
thin branches. It's an attractive plant and what has been an extra bonus is 
that it attracts hummingbirds who stop and rest on it." 
</P>
<P>
The jade succulent resembles its Oriental cousin. Aloe comes in many varieties. 
Still other types of succulents resemble ferns. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get involved with these plants, it's hard to stop," Garretson said. 
His wife's initial purchase of a small gray succulent -- commonly known as baby 
toe or living stone because of its smooth, round appearance -- started the 
Garretsons' fascination with this species. 
</P>
<P>
The ease of caring for cacti is probably one of its primary attributes. Once it 
has been planted, there is little maintenance involved. However, make sure to 
leave enough space between the plants since they can grow quite large. 
Succulents should also be planted in loose, rocky soil with good drainage. In 
keeping with the desert or Southwestern look, many cacti gardeners cover the 
ground with pebbles or white stones. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than light watering . . . the only real maintenance is pulling weeds," 
Garretson said. "By scattering rocks or stones, you can better control the 
weeds. 
</P>
<P>
"And they had better be pretty hearty weeds," he said with a laugh. "Because 
they aren't going to get much water." 
</P>
<P>
Most varieties of succulents grow well together, and Garretson said it's not 
necessary to plant only cacti. In his own garden, he has flowers and other 
varieties of plants mixed in with the succulents. However, he does warn that 
cacti have a dominant tendency. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to keep your cactus plant small, keep it in a pot," he 
recommended. "Also, don't be too hasty in tossing out a cactus that looks like 
it's seen better days. Often cactus, especially during the winter months, may 
appear dead, when in fact it's just lying dormant for a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of folks throw away perfectly good plants because they mistakenly 
believe it's dead," he said. "Before throwing it out, check very closely for 
any signs of new growth. Sometimes the only clue you may have is a very tiny 
leaf or clump, but if you look carefully, you can see it. Before you throw it 
out, just keep a watch for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Starting new plants is often as simple as breaking off a piece or cluster, and 
planting it in a small pot until it forms new roots. When transplanting from a 
pot to the ground, be careful not to over-water. Unlike most other plants that 
require more watering when first planted, if a cactus receives too much water, 
it can collapse and rot. 
</P>
<P>
Cacti also tend to do well in pots, especially if they're outdoors in the 
sunlight. Plants in containers should have a fast-draining mix with a large 
drain hole in the bottom. Also be aware that plants in containers may require a 
little more water than those planted directly in the ground, but the amount of 
water needed is still less than that of most other plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine planting anything other than succulents," Palisi said. 
"Besides, it's easy for friends to find my house. I just tell them it's the one 
with the innovative garden. 
</P>
<P>
"Since people are becoming aware of water conservation, more of my neighbors 
have been asking me about succulents. When I tell them what my water bill is, 
they can't believe it's so low compared to what they pay. I think we're going 
to be seeing quite a few more places planting cacti now."

ARTIFICIAL SANDSTONE MESAS AND FABRICATED ROCK GROTTOES TURN A HILLSIDE LAGUNA 
BEACH POOL INTO A 'NATURAL' PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Liz and Volkert Bernbeck would tell friends they planned to build a 
swimming pool on the hillside below their Laguna Beach home, the response was 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"The hill was so steep it was hard for anyone to imagine how it could be done," 
Liz recalled as she negotiated a series of rock steps leading down to a 
sandstone grotto, her 2-year-old daughter in tow. "They'd stand on the balcony 
and look down and laugh." 
</P>
<P>
No one is laughing now. 
</P>
<P>
To say that the Bernbecks built a swimming pool is to say that the Titanic 
struck an ice cube. 
</P>
<P>
After six years of planning, another full year's work by teams of skilled 
craftsmen and a cash outlay of about $170,000, the Bernbecks ended up with not 
only a pool, but an entire mountain of sandstone mesas and rock grottoes spread 
over an acre of hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
And, except for the flora and a few scattered boulders, the whole thing is as 
phony as a Mafia tax return. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Bernbeck is an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Its cracked and weathered rock face is actually a shell of hand-sculpted 
concrete set against steel reinforcing bars and chicken wire. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Nature may have been the model for this ancient sandstone outcropping, 
but she was not the architect. That task went to Rock and Waterscape Systems in 
Irvine, a company of 150 people who design and build naturalistic rock and 
water habitats from artificial means. 
</P>
<P>
While the company has routinely performed commercial waterscaping jobs for 
Disneyland, hotels, zoos and theme parks around the world, only in recent years 
has the growing residential demand for fabrication played a significant role in 
its $25-million-a-year business. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the company expects to perform about 25 large custom residential 
jobs in Orange County alone. "That's about twice the number we did here just 
three or four years ago," said Lance Friesz, Rock and Waterscape's marketing 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just starting to find out what's possible in creating 
natural-looking rock formations," said Friesz, an 18-year veteran with the 
company. "As they get out and travel around the world, they see some of the 
fantastic commercial projects that have been done and they come home and want 
to do something similar for their yards and pools." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case with the Bernbecks, who, while on a visit to Hawaii a 
half-dozen years ago, saw one of the company's fabricated sandstone grottoes at 
their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Volkert said he thought a smaller version of the grotto would look nice in his 
back yard. A check with the hotel revealed the name of the builder. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, the same talents that had built hotel lagoons for Disney, 
Hyatt and Hilton, realistic animal enclosures for the San Diego Zoo, and show 
attractions such as Camp Snoopy at Knott's Berry Farm, were set to work 
transforming shrub and dirt into rock mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bernbecks originally intended to build a modest rock swimming 
pool, when work finally ended a year later, it looked like a chunk of 
Disneyland had fallen from the sky and landed -- intact -- on the hillside 
behind their home. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept expanding the rock work and adding more water features as things went 
along," Volkert explained. "It just kept growing until what you see today." 
</P>
<P>
That sight now includes a spectacular sweep of sandstone ridges, a 
cliff-hugging pool, two waterfalls, spa, running stream, fountain, reflecting 
pond, and a water slide that would give vertigo to a mountain goat. 
</P>
<P>
Liz said the city of Laguna Beach needed to be persuaded that the massive 
complex of water and rock would stay on the hill and not end up on the Coast 
Highway 500 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed approval (for expanding the project), of course," she said. "The 
city was concerned about the stability of so much rock work." 
</P>
<P>
After checking work plans and consulting with the engineers at Rock and 
Waterscape, Liz said the city agreed to the project. "We were very, very 
surprised that it went through with such relative ease, considering the scope 
of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Bernbeck back yard is among the company's more ambitious residential 
projects, according to Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone has all the water amenities that they do," he said. "But more and 
more, people with the financial means are getting bolder in their approach to 
outdoor fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Culbertson, sales manager for Regina's Statuary in Costa Mesa, said the 
trend toward natural water settings is quickly catching on with county 
residents. Although currently specializing in more traditional precast 
fountains for the home, he said his company will soon begin developing its own 
molds for creating rock waterfalls and rock-lined pools. 
</P>
<P>
Culbertson, who has done custom rock work for other companies in the past, said 
that the demand for all forms of outdoor water features, including wall and 
free-standing fountains, has at least doubled in the past half-dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
To help meet this growing demand, companies have started to offer lines of 
prefabricated waterscapes. Rock and Waterscape, for example, has created an 
assortment of waterfalls, ponds and grottoes priced from $500 to as much as 
$30,000. The units come ready to install with piping and pumps for the 
circulation of water. 
</P>
<P>
"If a (landscape)contractor or homeowner doesn't have the money to put together 
a good custom display, these prefab units can be pulled off the shelf and 
installed in as little as 10 working days," explained Friesz, adding that his 
company expects to sell close to 100 ready-made units this year for placement 
in private back yards throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the corrosive action of natural alkali in water, the concrete used in 
fabricated rock formations must be reinforced with alkali-resistant plastic 
fibers to prevent breakdown of the formation over time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to Friesz, the longer water runs over the artificial stone 
surfaces, the more natural-looking they become due to staining and the gentle 
abrasive action of particles found in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is that you get a balloon of colors from debris that drops from 
the trees, from leaves that sit in the water, and from trace metals that are 
released from within the concrete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A good example of this natural weathering process can be seen on the stone face 
of a three-waterfall grotto that the company installed six years ago in the 
Newport Beach back yard of Robert Mayer, who is co-owner of the new Waterfront 
Hilton hotel in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The rock looks better and better as it gets older," said Mayer, pointing out 
the darkening streaks of discoloration similar to those found on real 
water-exposed stone. "It really is hard to believe that it's not the genuine 
article." 
</P>
<P>
Friesz said that to achieve realism, latex impressions are sometimes made of 
actual rock formations from which molds are built. "We've taken impressions 
from all over California and the western United States." 
</P>
<P>
By adding the correct tints during the coloring process, said Friesz, it is 
possible to duplicate any type or shape of rock. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of real-life molding, however, is expensive. 
</P>
<P>
To save money, most residential rock work is hand-sculpted on the spot as the 
concrete is applied to its foundation of steel bars and chicken wire. Although 
sculptors are guided in their work by an exact scale model of how the project 
should look, a certain degree of free-style creativity is possible -- and even 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say the homeowner doesn't quite like how something is turning out," 
Friesz said. "Then he can ask to have it changed on the spot and our people can 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what Liz and Volkert Bernbeck did during the months of stony 
creation that took place in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great how much input we had throughout the whole process," Liz said. 
"If the shape of a rock bothered us, the artists would scrape off the concrete, 
bend the rebar (reinforcing bar) a different way, and do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Volkert said he even asked the artists to paint the existing rocks on his 
property to match the sandstone mesas being built in terraces descending the 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we like to play a game with our guests and ask them to pick out the real 
rocks from the fake," he said, laughing. "They almost never can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the Bernbecks admit, they are as mystified as anyone by the illusion 
achieved on their hillside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible," Liz said. "In a year, when all the landscaping has grown in, 
it will look unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
As well as believable, she might add.
