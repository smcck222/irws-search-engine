DOING OUR PART

An impasse is developing on the issue of the debt of developing nations, and 
the plight of some of those nations is now being further complicated by delays 
in assuring new funding for the International Development Assn., the World 
Bank's soft-loan division. Both Washington and Wall Street have roles to play 
in finding a solution. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, through his Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, has been 
giving strong leadership to resolving the debt problem. He has indicated 
willingness to forgive debts owed the U.S. government, primarily by poor 
sub-Saharan African nations. And he has put together a plan of public and 
private, national and international funding to ease the debts owed largely to 
commercial banks, notably by Latin American nations and the Philippines. But a 
rebellion by the bankers now puts the program at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The banks have failed to forgive substantial enough portions of the Third World 
indebtedness that they themselves promoted, albeit encouraged by the American 
government. And now they are holding back on a critical element of the 
Bush-Brady Plan, the investment of substantial new money. To call this attitude 
short-sighted is to be overly polite. But it is a reality of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
There are several things that the American government can do to improve the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to the banks, it may now be necessary to provide some incentives, 
either in regulatory shifts to allow more generous bookkeeping by the banks on 
their Third World debts, or in tax concessions for new investment in critical 
areas. It is not far-fetched to defend such concessions in the name of national 
security. The security of the Western Hemisphere could be gravely affected by 
further economic deterioration in the key debtor nations -- Mexico, Brazil, 
Argentina and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
As for the government, the President needs to end his coyness and give vigorous 
leadership to funding the international mechanisms that have been given pivotal 
roles in the debt crisis: The International Monetary Fund, now requesting a 
100% increase in its quota; the World Bank, now being threatened by some 
members of Congress with withdrawal of promised American funds; and the 
International Development Assn., the World Bank arm that helps the poorest 
nations with concessional loans. The United States should fully participate in 
a replenishment of at least $14.5 billion to the IDA, a proposal agreed to by 
all of the other major donors. Incidentally, these are not costly ventures for 
the government because most of the funding is in the form of guarantees rather 
than outright appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
Will this work? Perhaps not everywhere. The situation in Argentina defies, for 
the moment, any rational solution. Brazil, the biggest debtor of all the 
developing nations, skipped a $1.6 billion interest payment Sept. 18, an 
ominous sign of its tenuous situation. But the rescue package for Mexico is 
still intact, although it has not reversed the egregious flight of the elite's 
capital from Mexico. And in most of the debtor nations, even a modest increase 
in new resources can make an enormous difference at a time when many of them 
are forced to spend most of their export earnings on debt service and 
repayment. 
</P>
<P>
The President has recognized the importance of addressing the problem of Poland 
and Hungary, a rare opportunity for the international community and 
international agencies like the IMF to demonstrate their commitment to 
development. The issue of Poland's development is seen in Washington in sharply 
defined East-West security terms. Bush now needs to remind the nation, and its 
bankers, that American security and prosperity are vitally linked not just 
across the Iron Curtain, but also south across the border, to the developing 
nations of the world.

SELF-ESTEEM IS EARNED, NOT LEARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SCHMOKER, Mike Schmoker is coordinator of elementary school libraries 
for the Amphitheater District in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The word "self-esteem" has become an educational incantation. Every educational 
discussion, every stated school district goal and mission takes a bow in its 
direction. Its influence on academic and behavioral standards in our schools 
cannot be overstated. There is even a California Task Force to Promote 
Self-Esteem and Social Responsibility, and the University of California 
recently published a book linking low self-esteem to social problems. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the word seems innocent enough and something about which we should be 
concerned. But if the meaning of a word is its use, we must look to pop 
psychology, which gave us this word, in order to fully understand its 
importance: Before it reached education, it had already taken on the fatuous 
implication that what is precious can be gotten cheaply. Self-esteem, as it is 
now used, isn't something earned but given. It isn't wrought but spontaneously 
realized. Such thinking is inimical to what schools should be trying to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
What disturbs me is that self-esteem has been sentimentalized. The new 
self-esteem has less to do with forging a connection between it and achievement 
and more to do with simply creating good feelings. 
</P>
<P>
This is an understandable reaction to a difficult problem. So many young people 
are burdened with negative, defeatist feelings, not all of which, certainly, is 
their fault. We want to help them, and the quicker the better. But as time has 
passed, it is mystifying that we have not seen this impulse for what it is. 
I've seen whole auditoriums full of students being told, indiscriminately, to 
feel good about themselves, being asked at random to stand up and give 
testimonials on how swell they are, and that by clinging to this confidence 
they will succeed mightily. 
</P>
<P>
This is a flimsy notion, and no one believes it. Not for very long anyway. Like 
it or not, self-esteem is very much a function of such unyielding realities as 
what we can do, what we've done with what we have and what we've made of 
ourselves. And so the school -- with every effort toward sensitivity, 
compassion and encouragement -- should reinforce this, while cultivating 
ability, talent, decency and the capacity for sustained effort, the belief that 
you get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Shortcuts, such as routinely heaping inordinate praise on shoddy work, or 
lowering academic standards, do not work. Ask any teacher, in a moment of 
candor, if they can get average kids, the majority of students, to make a 
sufficient effort in school, make good use of class time or do fairly 
conscientious work on homework and assignments. An alarming number of teachers 
don't think so. Many complain of a malaise among students, that only about half 
their students will even do homework. Despite this, there has never been more 
pressure for teachers to be enormously upbeat in dealing with students and 
student efforts. Promotion is nearly automatic, and grades are higher than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
What this tells students, at least tacitly, is that what they are doing is good 
enough and that our insistence on quality is a bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Its ironic that the reason often cited for generous grading and a reluctance to 
fail students centers on self-esteem. In the name of self-esteem, then, we are 
asked to give young people something they didn't earn in the mistaken hope that 
they can go on to master what is presumably harder than what they have already 
failed to learn. 
</P>
<P>
What they do learn is to play the game, the essence of which is that standards 
are not based on what students should do, or are able to do, but on what they 
will do, no matter how low the common denominator. Which is, as we know, pretty 
low; among industrialized nations, we are embarrassingly ranked in every 
academic category. 
</P>
<P>
But you'll seldom see these deficiencies reflected in American report cards. 
The plain, unpleasant truth is hidden behind the good grades, lost in the 
peculiarly positive climate that too often prevails in our schools. If you're 
not sure that's true, consider this: A recent international survey showed that 
South Korean students rank first in mathematics, American students near the 
bottom. When asked where they thought they ranked, the American students ranked 
themselves at the top and the Koreans at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
It is common knowledge that too much groundless praise can breed complacency. 
It can. And it has. 
</P>
<P>
For our part, the best we can do is teach young people, in an atmosphere of 
compassion, that self-respect is earned, often with considerable difficulty, 
and equip them to earn it.

SALARY EQUITY CHANGES FORUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal district court ruling that the California State Employees Assn. 
failed to prove deliberate sex discrimination in the setting of salaries for 
female-dominated jobs is not a vindication of those who claim salary 
discrimination does not exist. The decision does demonstrate, however, that 
cases involving the "comparable worth" issue are sometimes best handled outside 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, who once worked as a lawyer for the 
National Organization for Women, dismissed the key part of what was the largest 
sex-bias salary lawsuit in the nation. The judge said that lawyers representing 
60,000 past and present state workers failed to prove that jobs largely held by 
women -- usually clerical -- were undervalued just because women held them. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by state workers cited the gap between certain 
gender-dominated jobs: The starting salary for licensed vocational nurses was 
$1,376 a month, while the pay for automotive equipment operators was $1,645. 
But the judge said the state made a good case that its salaries reflected 
market rates, without specific discriminatory intent. She did allow union 
lawyers to submit arguments that the state has policies that appear to be 
neutral but in practice keep women's wages down. But that route is made more 
difficult because of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that sets a heavier 
burden for proving discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
These decisions, and others, all appear to point to the problems of resolving 
thorny pay equity issues in court. The threat of a lawsuit remains an important 
prod for forcing action; but in the current court climate other methods, 
including use of political pressure and negotiation, must be stressed. 
</P>
<P>
Exemplary agreements have stemmed from the collective bargaining process, 
although the Deukmejian Administration resisted settling this issue through 
compromise. The city of Los Angeles is an example where political will provided 
an atmosphere in which city and union negotiators in 1985 were able to hammer 
out an agreement that provided fairness without bankrupting the city. 
</P>
<P>
The salary adjustments closed the 15% pay gap between wages paid to the city's 
librarians and clerical employees and wages paid to those in traditionally male 
jobs, such as drivers and gardeners. Over a three-year phase-in, the 
adjustments cost about one-half of 1% of the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the tenor of recent court decisions, the notion that vocational 
nurses should be paid at least as much as automotive equipment operators is not 
a wacky idea. But translating that idea into results for working women 
increasingly seems best suited for employee-management negotiation.

FERDINAND MARCOS DIES IN EXILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial, it is unfortunate that The Times has contributed 
to the relentless attack against a defenseless man. Not even with his death can 
the forsaken man find peace. 
</P>
<P>
As for President Corazon Aquino, her kind words are not enough to heal this 
great injustice. Don't tell us that you know how it feels to lose a loved one. 
Sure, her husband was killed, but no government prevented her from being at his 
side, nor were her family members kept away at a time of crisis. And she was 
not barred from burying her husband's remains at his rightful place, that is, 
his homeland. Her case can hardly be compared to the Marcoses. 
</P>
<P>
The simple truth is that Aquino's government is not interested in an end to the 
great division in the Philippines. It is obvious that her action is 
characterized by vindictiveness. Her action will never end the ongoing conflict 
among the various factions. 
</P>
<P>
Never has such cruelty been displayed by a supposedly democratic, civilized 
government. Her saintly, benevolent image has been shattered. The world has 
witnessed the true nature of this woman: stone-hearted, cruel and vindictive.

INTERPRETING 2ND AMENDMENT: RESTRICTING GUN OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
None of the NRA members who complained about The Times' courageous "22 Cowardly 
Acts" editorial (Sept. 17) gave any valid reason for objecting to a 15-day 
waiting period for the delivery of any firearm. Don't they plan their hunting 
trips far enough in advance to order the newest weapon in time? 
</P>
<P>
They make a big point about "criminals" getting them regardless -- but the San 
Ysidro and the Stockton (schoolyard) mass murders, with a total of 26 people 
dead and 30 wounded, were committed by psychopaths. We law-abiding gun-fearing 
citizens want guns kept out of the hands of mentally-deranged random killers 
who can walk into a gun shop and buy one right now. 
</P>
<P>
If the law-abiding NRA members want to form a militia and have a right to bear 
arms, fine, but remember that when the Second Amendment was written, there was 
no viable army, there was no National Guard, there weren't any state, county 
and city police departments. It's the "well-regulated militia" that they 
conveniently forget about when quoting their favorite part of the Second 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-one percent of Americans favor a waiting period for gun purchases 
(Times, Dec. 21, 1988). Politicians take notice that there are more of us than 
of the high-pressure gun lobby and its deep-pocket NRA supporters.

ZSA ZSA GABOR FOUND GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The many judgments of Gabor seem to be made on her fame and wealth, and not on 
the evidence that she was beat and bruised by a so-called officer of the law. 
Witnesses corroborated her story and other citizens testified to similar 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, I think a critical issue was overlooked: that police abuse is a 
common occurrence and is conveniently passed off under the guise of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The message has been made clear that most people disapprove of Gabor for many 
reasons. When will the message be made clear that police abuse of generally 
law-abiding citizens is intolerable? In spite of her high profile, Zsa Zsa, I 
fear, is only the tip of the iceberg.

INTERPRETING 2ND AMENDMENT: RESTRICTING GUN OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is not an argument regarding the merits of gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
Second Amendment states (1791): "A well regulated militia, being necessary to 
the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, 
shall not be infringed." As often happens in law, a simple English sentence may 
have legal significance which determines the application of the words. 
</P>
<P>
The Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill 
of Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from 
the federal government. The Second Amendment stated one of the subjects about 
which the federal government was prohibited from making any laws. The word 
"people" as used in constitutional law is used collectively and refers to a 
political entity, such as a state, and does not mean "persons" or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
An early ruling in 1875 in U.S. vs. Cruikshank established the view of the U.S. 
Supreme Court, upheld in cases in 1886, 1894 and 1939. The court in Cruikshank 
said that the Second Amendment did not create a federally protected right of 
individuals but was an express limitation on the powers of the national 
(federal) government. 
</P>
<P>
There have been lower federal court decisions regarding the Second Amendment, 
all supportive of this established principle. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the Second Amendment as a constitutional issue is and has been 
for nearly 200 years: 
</P>
<P>
1) A restriction on the power of the federal government to limit or deny the 
states the right to have state militia. 
</P>
<P>
2) Not a federally protected right of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
There is no national document controlling the states with regard to arms. The 
states may regulate arms within their borders.

ZSA ZSA GABOR FOUND GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The manifest homophobia of Ms. Gabor during her trial for a variety of traffic 
and assault violations has brought great pain to the lesbian/gay community. She 
states that she fears going to jail because the lesbians there would threaten 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Later we are told in The Times (Sept. 21) that "She told jurors that Kramer 
(the arresting officer) must hate her because he is gay. . . . Three gentlemen 
came up to us, under oath, and said they slept with Mr. Kramer," Gabor 
testified, and she added, "Don't you know, a gay would not like a woman like 
Zsa Zsa Gabor. Why would he? I marry all the men he would want to have." 
</P>
<P>
She made these statements to attempt to prejudice the jury in her favor. For 
shame! We lesbian/gay folk were impeached in testimony, denied access to 
community resources, to the decision-making processes of society for thousands 
of years by just such homophobic statements. Happily for us, we have staged a 
worldwide nonviolent social revolution to change such attitudes. What we have 
commenced to do is working -- far from perfectly, but working. 
</P>
<P>
I know nothing of Officer Paul Kramer's private life (and it is none of my 
business), nor that of Ms. Gabor. I do know something about jail conditions. 
Yes, there are lesbians in custody, along with unknown numbers of non-gay 
women. They have troubles enough with survival, and search for justice under 
day-to-day conditions, without Ms. Gabor trying to worsen their situation. 
</P>
<P>
Her statements have forced us to recall just how judgmental society was until 
this generation. Our educational effort must go right on. But we must take time 
out to respond to such painful statements.

INTERPRETING 2ND AMENDMENT: RESTRICTING GUN OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As hard as The Times tries to manipulate its readers to reject firearms, the 
necessity to protect oneself with firearms always seems to present itself as 
the only alternative. Case in point: The devastation caused by hurricane Hugo 
in St. Croix had left that island temporarily without law and order. People 
lost property and lives to roving groups of thugs. But the armed law-abiding 
citizens who were confronted by these groups preserved their lives and 
property. 
</P>
<P>
A report of a woman being shot to death after receiving threats from her 
estranged husband could have been preventable in like manner. If she was also 
armed and ready to use her firearm as the need dictated, maybe no shots would 
have been fired and she would be alive, her child would have a mother and the 
police would have been looking for her husband on the charge of assault with a 
deadly weapon instead of murder. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if she wanted to buy a firearm for protection, the "cooling off" 
period required for firearms purchases would not protect her from a "hothead" 
who already possesses one. Our laws have failed her, and many others. It's time 
to change them.

Every measure with which we are familiar supports the observation that America 
is moving backward in race relations. What an indictment of our country. What 
an indictment of our leaders -- President, Congress, Supreme Court, governors,

executives and educators. What an indictment of us as citizens.

America is more like a salad bowl than a melting pot, according to former Rep. 
Shirley Chisholm of New York, but if we don't pay more attention to making the 
mixture flavorful and nourishing, we will develop a national indigestion of 
such magnitude that it will stop us in our tracks.

<P>
We are a nation of great strengths. We put men and women into space, we lead

But we have made little progress in resolving the conflicts between ethnic

spiritual ends of our lives in personal character and social justice. Without 
this spiritual and moral reawakening we shall destroy ourselves in the misuse 
of our own instruments." 
</P>
<P>
We must be concerned about the signs of our collective failure. We must be 
concerned about the failure of our schools and, more specifically, the failure 
of African American students in our schools. We must be concerned that young 
black males in our cities know where every playground and basketball court is 
within a 10-mile radius and yet don't have the slightest idea where the closest 
library is, while their parents encourage the former and don't care about the 
latter. We must be concerned that these young black males constitute 3.5% of 
all college enrollment and comprise 46% of our prison population. 
</P>
<P>
We must be concerned that every year for the past five years, fewer young black 
men and women have entered college -- and many who choose predominantly white 
institutions face a level of hatred, prejudice and ignorance comparable to that 
of the days of Bull Connor, Lester Maddox and Orval Faubus, in the early 
civil-rights era. We must be concerned that twice as many black teen-age girls 
drop out of high school each year to have babies than graduate from college. 
</P>
<P>
We must be concerned that 44% of the black adults in America are marginally, 
functionally or totally illiterate, and that in too many of our neighborhoods, 
fathers, mothers, sons and daughters are consumed by drugs, gangs, joblessness 
and despair. We must be concerned that we are faced with the challenge of 
breaking the cycle of debilitating poverty and exclusion that cripples the 
majority of African Americans and is every bit as evil, pervasive and 
pernicious as institutionalized racism. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in America's leadership act as if the war against racism were over. 
That attitude has emboldened the bigots among us, because they think our 
national guard has been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I read a letter that Roger Stanton, 
publisher of Football News, sent to Tom Brokaw after NBC-TV did a special on 
blacks in athletics. Stanton criticized Brokaw for suggesting that the National 
Football League discriminated against black athletes. Stanton argued that 
blacks were incapable of doing certain things in football, including playing 
the position of quarterback. Doug Williams' Super Bowl victory, in his mind, 
was a fluke that will not be repeated. After reflecting on his letter, I 
decided that crying was more appropriate than laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Let's talk for a moment about some of the signs of racism appearing on our 
college and university campuses. During the past year, about 200 cases of 
racial confrontations have been reported. Only the most optimistic person would 
believe that the total number of such incidents is nearly as low as that 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
These confrontations have taken many forms. They include clashes between 
African American and white students at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and 
UCLA; confrontations between Jewish and African American students at the 
University of Maryland; harassment of a black cadet at the Citadel, the 
military college in South Carolina, and countless other cases that have filled 
newspapers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The alarming rise in racial violence on campuses and the equally alarming 
revitalization of the white supremacist movement, as exemplified by the 
Nazi-like behavior of "skinhead" gangs, has not escaped notice. In a similar 
vein, the election to the Louisiana Legislature of David Duke, the former grand 
wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, sends a signal that the gains of the 
1960s and 1970s toward racial harmony are over. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, racism and bigotry are back on campus with a vengeance. We can ask any of 
those black students who were chased and beaten at the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst, who were taunted with defamatory posters at Penn 
State and Stanford, who were subjected to racist jokes on the University of 
Michigan radio station, or who were presented with a "mock slave auction" at 
the University of Wisconsin. Or we can ask the Jewish students who have had 
swastikas painted on their dormitory doors on campuses across the country, from 
Harvard to Occidental. Or ask the Latino students at UCLA about their reaction 
to the film "Animal Attraction," which was produced by a UCLA graduate student 
with the support of many of his faculty members and portrayed Mexican Americans 
in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot afford to be discouraged, although there is much that is 
discouraging. We cannot let acts of violence and brutality cause us to lose 
sight of the benefits to be gained by joining together to create harmony from 
the jangling discord around us. We cannot let our national policies be set by 
personalities like Sen. Jesse Helms while we stand by silently. We cannot let 
the goals of brotherhood and justice be torn asunder by those who believe that 
any race has an inalienable right to control the lives of another. 
</P>
<P>
As Martin Luther King Jr. said: "We must work unceasingly to lift this nation 
that we love to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more 
noble expression of humaneness. . . . We must use time creatively in the 
knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right."

Regardless of anyone's opinion of Al Davis, he is again to be commended for the 
ability to follow his own conscious, rather than maintain status quo. 
</P>
<P>
When he felt his franchise could reap economic benefits by moving from Oakland 
to Los Angeles, he proceeded despite opposition from the NFL hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
When he felt the Raiders straying from the traditional path known as Raider 
football, he had the courage to make a change during the course of the regular 
season. More important, he drew upon a gem, Hall of Famer Art Shell, to 
resurrect the "pride and poise" that we have known as Raider football. 
</P>
<P>
As a footnote, the qualified person chosen happens to be black. Considering the 
significance of the event, it's great to feel that this factor had minimal 
importance, rather than being the motivation.

REPORTER COMMENDED FOR TAKING ON TAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to commend Julie Cart for her recent articles regarding the 
unconscionable exploits of The Athletics Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some day the truth will come out about TAC in a public forum. It 
obviously won't come out of a clandestine, self-serving TAC meeting. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that talk of lawsuits to be brought against Darrell Robinson by 
Florence Griffith-Joyner and Carl Lewis is simply rhetoric and empty threats. 
</P>
<P>
If either sues, the truth is likely to come out with the subpoenaing of 
athletes, coaches, doctors and others involved with drug use. Until this issue 
is brought to court, the truth will come only in the form of a TAC 
"investigation," and we know how reliable those are.

GRIFFITH, MCMURTRY AT WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"She's like the Donna Reed of country music," said one fan at Nanci Griffith's 
concert Thursday at the Wadsworth Theater, marveling over the Texas-bred 
singer's infectious smile and indefatigable sweetness. That may be stretching 
it, but think maybe of brainy Suzanne Vega -- whose wispy voice Griffith's own 
resembles -- possessed by the sentimental spirit of Donna. 
</P>
<P>
While the Age of Irony has permeated even the neo-folkie movement, Griffith is 
someone who still projects old-style earnestness, and who saves most of the 
humor for the between-song storytelling and not as a method to distance herself 
from her own emotions. She's a little too eccentric to be a proper 
easy-listening artist, and too traditionally sedate -- some might say precious 
-- to be artsy, but her folksy and occasionally country-ish music does have a 
following, evidenced by the Wadsworth's near-capacity turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday all that sincerity came off as charming, disarming and entertainingly 
edgeless. Griffith can't be accused of skirting reality to achieve her 
sweetness (songs like the new "Drive-In Movies and Dashboard Lights," about the 
fate of a former "back-seat queen," have plenty of poignancy), but what you 
carry away, more than her lyrical observations, is the way she'll jump up in 
the air to end a song, or the helplessly-in-love-with-her-audience Donna smile, 
or just the lingering sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
Opening act James McMurtry's folk-rock anachronisms differ: He doesn't budge on 
stage, has unfashionably parted frizzy hair, sings in a disaffected monotone 
and indulges heavily in what he called "the serious songwriter thing." Catching 
him at a coffeehouse, you might be transfixed by his promising songs, but at 
the larger Wadsworth, his lack of passion was catching. If Griffith is a nice 
antidote for 1989, offering real kindness and gentleness for what is actually a 
less K&amp;G era, McMurtry is probably 15 years too late to impact with his 
just-the-facts drawl. CHRIS WILLMAN

JUILLIARD BEGINS BEETHOVEN CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Juilliard String Quartet, which appeared at Ambassador Auditorium on 
Thursday for the first of five season-spanning concerts devoted to the complete 
quartets of Beethoven, has, in various personnel configurations, been putting 
on this show for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
So the critical pulse hardly races in anticipation of yet another Juilliard go 
at the canonic 17. But it didn't take long before Beethoven and the best 
Juilliard configuration ever -- founding first violinist Robert Mann and his 
younger colleagues, second violinist Joel Smirnoff, violist Samuel Rhodes and 
cellist Joel Krosnick -- made us willing captives. 
</P>
<P>
To open, there was the quartet in F, Opus 18, No. 1. Its bluff joviality 
embraces a slow movement as intensely emotional as anything Beethoven ever 
created, although its formal clarity would give way to the less direct methods 
employed in the later works. 
</P>
<P>
The creative perspiration of self-consciously deep works of Beethoven's last 
period -- such as the Quartet in A minor, Opus 132 -- was minimized by playing 
of uncommon sweetness and lightness of tone. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the performers backtracked to the composer's middle period with the 
grandly self-assured, vivacious "Razumovsky" Quartet in C, Opus 59, No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
If they lost some of their concentration here -- the Minuet tended to wander -- 
the precipitous finale offered that combination of ardor, technical aplomb and 
linear clarity that is the essence and particular joy of Juilliard. HERBERT 
GLASS

'BRADDOCK': DREAMS OF A RUSTING STEEL TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Lightning Over Braddock: A Rust Bowl Fantasy" (at the Monica 4-Plex on 
weekends) is a movie with flesh, sweat and a warm grip. You can sense a human 
being behind it. As you watch, you begin to see as he sees, hear as he hears. 
</P>
<P>
Shot over four years on a budget of about $40,000, "Lightning" is the first 
feature of Tony Buba, a 44-year-old quirk documentarian. Buba sets it in his 
hometown, a once-thriving Pittsburgh suburb called Braddock. Over the last 15 
years, he has made a dozen short films about its people: a smoothly engaging 
macho bantam street hustler named Sal Caru, a union organizer-rock accordionist 
named Steve Pellegrino and a constantly failing but eternally buoyant local 
entrepreneur named Jim Roy. All of them are in this film too. 
</P>
<P>
And now, since his town, along with the rest of the area, is dying -- its 
population down by almost 75%, the nearby Dorothy Six mill about to be closed, 
businesses and movie theaters shuttered, the school gone -- Buba's become a 
chronicler of the disintegration of the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is reflexive. We see "Lightning" being shot, dreams of Tony and Sal, 
parodies of "Gandhi" and "Rambo," wildly enthusiastic reviews on TV. But it's 
clear that this collaboration will fall apart, that an anticipated Hollywood 
contract will never arrive. Meanwhile, outside, the mills close, the streets 
empty, the ex-workers demonstrate. Life subverts the macho fantasies of the 
movie: pipe-dreams incarnated in the smooth, goombah-goombah Sinatra-inflected 
badinage of Sweet Sal, the way his baritone drags on "yeaaah," the profanity 
and braggadocio that rolls off his tongue like honeyed cough drops. 
</P>
<P>
As Buba shows us a parade of clowns and victims, marchers and kvetchers, he 
makes it clear that he does not stand apart from them. Like his neighbors, he 
is watching a world and a way of life collapse. Like them, he tries whatever he 
can, in some small way, to prevent the inevitable. And like them, he dreams 
foolish, glamorous, violent dreams of success, romance and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike them, he can record those dreams, play them back. A recurrent image of 
"Lightning" is the mustachioed Buba -- looking something like a cheerful, 
sloppy Pittsburgh Zapata -- hunched over his movieola, contemplating the film 
he's shot, trying to make sense of it. But he can't. The order he finds is the 
one he's imposed. The region that is dying will die whatever he does. 
</P>
<P>
"Lightning's" major flaw is the fantasy sequences, too tacky for the overall 
vision. And there are substantial elements to that vision. "Lightning Over 
Braddock" is about dreaming as your world dies around you. It's a central theme 
of American literature, but Buba jokes it up, concentrates on these three 
dreamers whose wild energy and bounding hope survive even the most ridiculous 
context. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-student radical Buba ruminates on the possibility that, when he dies, he 
will be greeted at the gate not by Peter but by Sacco and Vanzetti. Sal rages 
in his room at the stardom and wealth being denied him. Pellegrino sings 
"Jumpin' Jack Flash" on his accordion -- without sound, since there was no 
money for music rights. "Braddock, city of magic, where have you gone?" croons 
Jimmy Roy, in a melancholy lounge-lizard voice, against a backdrop of dying 
urban glitter. That is the core of this modestly immodest, expansively humble, 
objectively subjective, gigantic little film: lost magic. 
</P>
<P>
In its ragged perfection and wise silliness, "Lightning Over Braddock" 
(Times-rated: Mature for language) invites us to dream and wake up at the same 
time.

'CAN'T AFFORD TO GROW OLD' TOPICAL AND UNSETTLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm says that the elderly are getting more than 
their fair share of the nation's resources, while children are going to bed 
hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Policy analyst Peter Ferrara says that public-home health care for seniors 
would cause families to "shirk responsibilities" and want government-paid 
"maids and cooks." 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two-year-old, disabled Helen has enough savings to live in her small 
apartment for 10 more months. When she is officially impoverished, Medicaid 
will support her in a nursing home. She will lose her beloved pets, her privacy 
and her independence. "When you outlive your money," she says, "you're 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Helen, Lamm and Ferrara appear on tonight's PBS documentary "Can't Afford to 
Grow Old" (7 p.m. on Channel 28). In light of the devisiveness spurred by the 
Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, which the House of Representatives 
voted to repeal Wednesday, this is one unsettling hour. 
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Walter Cronkite and written, produced and directed by Roger Weisburg, 
the program inexorably addresses the aging of America through real people 
facing hard choices. We see a few of the millions of elderly coping alone or 
cared for by relatives whose own physical, financial and emotional resources 
are desperately strained. We hear arguments from those who feel that there 
should be no public, long-term, home health care plan. As is obviously 
intended, the dichotomy is shocking. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the next century, 22% of us will be elderly. Estimates are 
that our long-term care needs will triple; costs will increase 10-fold. 
</P>
<P>
An innovative Medicaid plan in Oregon has reduced its nursing home population 
by 33% (to the dismay of the nation's nursing home network), providing foster 
home and other alternative care. 
</P>
<P>
This has saved the state's taxpayers millions of dollars, we're told. If human 
dignity is hard to quantify, money isn't. LYNNE HEFFLEY

Joanie Bartels sings to youngsters in her big-band-singer-sort-of voice and 
seems to know just what children want to hear -- "Mairzy Doats," "The Witch 
Doctor," a little bit of the Beatles. She'll sing songs from several of her 
best-selling tapes, including her latest ("Bathtime Magic," designed to coax 
even the most resistant child into the tub) at a free mini-concert today at 11 
a.m. at Pages Books, 18399 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. She'll stay afterward for an

Craig Taubman will play original, upbeat rock 'n' roll at a Sunday concert at 
Kids Gym, USA, 12526 Riverside Drive, North Hollywood. Taubman, the star of 
several Disney videos, likes to get his young audience (3 and older) into the 
act, so he passes out maracas and other instruments to encourage them to join 
in the fun. Taubman plays the guitar and is backed by a small band. The concert 
lasts about 40 minutes and is $5 (under 3, free). Information: (818) 985-8200, 
after noon.

The brush at Franklin Canyon is big and overdue for a fire (a cyclic event, 
rangers say). Because everyone at the park is on fire alert anyway, they've 
decided to spread the word with Sunday's family-paced walk focusing on fire 
ecology. Docent Jo-Ann Caudill will talk about the chaparral plants, which can 
live six months without water and can survive periodic fires. Meet at 10 a.m. 
at the ranch house. The ranch is north of Beverly Hills. Taped information:

DAY HIKE: AN UPSIDE-DOWN WALK NEAR LAKE ARROWHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY, McKinney is the author of hiking books and a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little Bear Valley was its name before the dam was built in the 1890s. Then it 
was Little Bear Lake until the 1920s when Los Angeles investors bought it and 
changed the name to Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
By whatever name, the Lake Arrowhead country is the prettiest alpine area in 
the San Bernardino Mountains. And the nicest place for a stroll when you're 
visiting Arrowhead is the tranquil canyon cut by Little Bear Creek. Shaded by 
sugar pines and Jeffrey pines, oaks, sycamores and incense cedars, the canyon 
is a tranquil, woodsy retreat from metropolitan life. 
</P>
<P>
The waters of Little Bear Creek feed Lake Arrowhead. The creek is actually a 
tributary of Deep Creek, a significant San Bernardino Mountains watercourse and 
itself a tributary of the Mojave River. 
</P>
<P>
North Shore Trail is the name of the pathway that follows Little Bear Creek. 
The trail name is a bit misleading. Although the path begins above the 
northeast shore of Lake Arrowhead, it goes nowhere near the lake and, in fact, 
does not even offer a view of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
This is an easy hike, suitable for the whole family, but keep in mind that it's 
an upside-down walk; the elevation gain occurs on the way back. Pace yourself 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Interstate 10 in San Bernardino, take the 
Waterman Avenue/Highway 18 exit and wind 20 miles north into the San Bernardino 
Mountains. When California 18 junctions with California 173, take the latter 
highway and proceed 3 1/2 miles to Hospital Road and turn right. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, you'll spot the entrance to North Shore Public Campground, 
where the trailhead is. The Forest Service campground is open weekends, from 2 
p.m. Friday to 2 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the year, when the snow sticks, the Forest Service closes the 
campground until spring. However, day hikers may park in the upper lot at 
Mountains Community Hospital and walk the short distance into the campground. 
There is a Forest Service day-use fee. 
</P>
<P>
The trailhead is just off the campground road between Campsites 10 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: Head downslope, where you'll briefly sight the untidy remnants of a 
logging operation, then continue straight at an unsigned four-way junction and 
drop to a dirt road. On the other side of the road you'll join signed Trail 
3W12, pass by a seasonal creek and descend into the handsome canyon of Little 
Bear Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Shading the trail are some magnificent specimens of Jeffrey pine and incense 
cedar. Autumn leaves -- mostly from the stately sycamores -- carpet the trail. 
Bracken ferns line the trickling creek. Keep an eye out for the wild turkeys 
that patrol the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoy the sounds of the wind blowing through the pines, the murmuring creek. Of 
course, Norman-architecture Arrowhead Village and a shopping mall are just over 
the next ridge, but the resort might as well be a hundred miles away. 
</P>
<P>
North Shore Trail sticks to the north bank of Little Bear Creek. (Should we 
rename the path North Bank Trail?) The trail leaves the creek, humps over a 
knoll, then rejoins it after a quarter mile. 
</P>
<P>
Hang out along one of the bends in the creek before returning the way you came. 
If you want to walk every last foot of North Shore Trail, continue to a creek 
crossing, boulder-hop over Little Bear Creek and soon come to the trail's 
inglorious end at Hook Creek Road and an area popular with three-wheeler 
off-highway vehicles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NOT GUILTY PLEA IN THRIFT SHOP SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man who allegedly bludgeoned to death a thrift shop manager last 
month has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Carr, 33, was arrested Monday and charged with the murder of Jorge A. 
Dailey Sr., 68. Dailey, a retired restaurant worker, lived and worked at the 
Calvary Baptist Church Bargain Thrift Store at 61st and Main streets. His 
girlfriend found him Sept. 18 on the floor of the store, beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said a neighbor told them Carr, an unemployed meat cutter who lived 
next door to the thrift shop, was in the store before the killing. His 
fingerprints were also found there, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
When Carr was questioned, he made statements that implicate him in the crime, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
He is being held without bail at Los Angeles County Jail. A preliminary hearing 
is set for Oct. 18.

DISTRICT SCRAPS SCHOOL PLANS ON SITE OFFICIALS WANT PROTECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of feuding with city officials and environmentalists, the 
fast-growing Lancaster School District has backed away from a controversial 
plan to build a school in a desert woodlands area targeted by the city for 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated school officials this week agreed to seek alternate sites for a 
$13-million middle school they want to build on the west side of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they appear to have given up the fight over the 20-acre 
Quailwood site, the officials challenged the ecological importance of the site 
and accused city officials of making the issue "a political football." 
</P>
<P>
"That area is nothing but junk. It's had bums living there. It's had off-road 
vehicles tearing up the place. It's not at all prime desert woodlands," said 
Rowland King, assistant superintendent of the 10,600-student school district. 
</P>
<P>
But the city and others disagree. The Lancaster City Council in March 
designated the 72 acres of Joshua trees, junipers and sand dunes as prime 
desert woodlands. State and federal agencies also have supported its 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Resort 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of continued opposition from the city, school officials said 
they would try to buy the Quailwood site only as a last resort. "There has to 
be another site that's acceptable for us to build on and within our price 
range," said school board President Richard White. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has had money in escrow since early this year to buy the 
20-acre parcel for $1.12 million. It is in a largely undeveloped area of 
Lancaster at the northeast corner of 35th Street West and Avenue K-8. The 
school board tabled the purchase Monday. 
</P>
<P>
School officials are scheduled to recommend a new course of action at the next 
school board meeting Oct. 16. King said officials will probably recommend that 
the district use the condemnation process to obtain a suitable alternate site. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district could be forced to condemn the land because of the rising 
price of property in the area where the school would be located and because of 
developers' plans to use the land for other purposes. If the property is 
condemned, it would be the first time the district has had to use its powers to 
force an owner to sell land to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Quailwood site is only the latest obstacle to slow the 
district's efforts to build a new middle school, intended to serve about 750 
sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade students. School officials said the earliest 
a campus could open would be in two years. 
</P>
<P>
School officials originally had settled on a different site but had to drop 
that plan after they found that the ground would not be suitable. Then a land 
swap with developer David Waln collapsed, in part because of city obstructions, 
school officials claimed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, meanwhile, said they were just trying to uphold the city's goal 
of preserving the 72-acre desert area. City officials also said the Quailwood 
site was a poor location for a school because it is remote and because the 
single street in the area makes it too inaccessible and possibly unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage the district to build elsewhere, the City Council offered $300,000 
this week to help pay for improvements at an alternate school site. City 
officials said the district's purchase of the Quailwood site would have 
hampered the city's plan to buy nearby land because it would raise the price. 
</P>
<P>
The middle school, if built, would be the 16th school in the district, which is 
straining under enrollment increases of about 13% each year and chronic 
shortages of state funding for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
The district opened two elementary schools this fall and will open a third 
soon. There also are two other new campuses in progress ahead of the proposed 
middle school. School officials are considering whether to ask voters for a tax 
increase to help pay for the expansion.

FOES CONTEND STATE PRISON WILL HARM LAND VALUES; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY GROUP DISPUTES NEW REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a proposed prison in the Antelope Valley said Friday that they do 
not believe new state findings that the proposed 2,200-prisoner facility would 
not significantly harm property values. 
</P>
<P>
State officials released a report this week analyzing development in the area 
since the announcement in 1987 of the planned maximum- and medium-security 
prison at Avenue J and 60th Street West in northwest Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that property values have not suffered except in a small 
area near the proposed 232-acre site. And the report predicted that because 
western Lancaster is growing so rapidly, even the value of property closest to 
the prison will catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by a consultant hired to review the findings on 
property values contained in a voluminous environmental impact study released 
in January by the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
The chairwoman of the Antelope Valley Prison Committee, a group of residents, 
business people and government officials who oppose the prison, said Friday 
that the consultant reached the same faulty conclusions as the January report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Impacted Values' 
</P>
<P>
"We know that since this was announced in 1987, the prison site has impacted 
property values," said the chairwoman, real estate broker Danielle Marvin. "We 
want to show the state Legislature that things have not changed in this 
community regarding this site. It isn't that we don't understand the need for a 
prison. But we don't feel the state understands the amount of opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said builders and lenders with whom she deals are keeping a close eye on 
the prison issue. She said their concerns have adversely affected development 
in the area despite rapid growth in western Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to put the prison in the Antelope Valley resulted from a 1987 
"pain-for-pain" accord between Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature. 
The agreement was that a prison would be built in heavily Democratic East Los 
Angeles only if another prison needed in the county were built in the Antelope 
Valley, which is heavily Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Both communities have protested bitterly as the proposals go through the 
environmental review process. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster city officials say they will sue if James Rowland, Department of 
Corrections director, approves the proposal. Written responses to the latest 
report can be sent to the Department of Corrections until Oct. 31, and a final 
decision is expected by mid-December, said Judith McGillivray of the 
corrections department. 
</P>
<P>
If the site is approved, opponents will have 45 days to file suit. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site is on county land in the rural Mira Loma area of Lancaster 
near a County Jail facility housing about 1,600 prisoners.

EGYPTIAN SENTENCED TO 11 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ROOMMATE'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Egyptian was sentenced to 11 years in prison Friday for fatally 
stabbing a Van Nuys man with whom he had been living. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne A. Stoltz imposed the maximum term on 
Mohamed Abdelrazek, who had pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 
March 29, 1988, slaying of Suk Yun Yong, 51. 
</P>
<P>
In asking for the maximum sentence, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert P. Imerman called 
Abdelrazek, who was in the United States on a student visa but was not 
attending school, "brutal, vicious and callous." 
</P>
<P>
A probation report described Abdelrazek as a person with "no feelings for other 
human beings" and a "spoiled brat" who lived off his wealthy Cairo family. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was found in his Victory Boulevard apartment with nine deep stab 
wounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz ordered a second man who participated in the slaying, Michael Dean 
Wieland, 20, to undergo a psychiatric evaluation before his sentencing, 
scheduled for Jan. 5. Wieland, who also lived with Yong, pleaded guilty to 
participating in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz said while she accepted the probation report's assessment of Abdelrazek, 
letters sent by Wieland's relatives "mystify me as to what kind of person he 
is." She did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Abdelrazek and Wieland, who were arrested driving the victim's car, originally 
had been charged with murder but were permitted to plead guilty to the reduced 
charge.

CAR STRIKES, KILLS WOMAN IN CROSSWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys woman was struck and killed by a car Friday as she stepped off a 
curb at a Kester Avenue crosswalk, the Los Angeles Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was in her late 50s, died at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital 
about 30 minutes after the 7:05 p.m. accident in the 5400 block of Kester 
Avenue in Van Nuys, Sgt. Ray Lombardo said. Her name was withheld until 
relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was hit by a car driven by a Van Nuys man in his early 30s as she 
began to cross Kester in the crosswalk, which did not have a stop sign or a 
traffic light, Lombardo said. The car, traveling south on Kester, was changing 
lanes to pass another car making a left turn when it hit the woman in the far 
right lane, he said. The driver's name was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The car did not appear to be speeding, Lombardo said, and the driver was not 
cited, pending an investigation.

EMERITUS COLLEGE AIDS SENIORS WITH CLASSES AIMED AT RETIREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE WHEELOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of students went back to school last month, marking America's 
traditional September rite. Young people ranging from big-eyed kindergartners 
to seasoned college seniors made their way through classroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
Those enrolled at Emeritus College in Santa Monica may have a few years on such 
students, but they seem to have as much enthusiasm. About 3,500 Southland 
residents are enrolled in the state-financed adult education program of Santa 
Monica College, sampling from 100 eclectic not-for-credit daytime classes. 
</P>
<P>
Offering courses from Shakespeare and foreign policy to post-stroke exercise 
and instruction in living with hearing loss, Emeritus College has some new 
classes, new ideas and a new home. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1974 by Santa Monica College President Richard Moore, the school has 
just opened its first permanent facility on the renovated Third Street 
Promenade after 14 years of makeshift classrooms in Santa Monica community 
facilities and churches. 
</P>
<P>
School director Maggie Hall says this has brought about a philosophical change 
in the Emeritus program. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past," she said, "we tried not to publicize the program too much 
because we couldn't serve the students -- we didn't have enough locations. But 
this year we decided to seek support from the city of Santa Monica to help us 
grow, and they're paying for a third of the rent for our new buildings. We've 
got 15 new classes, and new faculty members are coming in with excitement and 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transition Period 
</P>
<P>
Emeritus College was designed, Hall said, to ease the transition between work 
and retirement. "People have certain specific life learning needs in later 
years, and education helps them to cope with diminishing physical capacity and 
financial resources. Our prime motive has always been to keep the older adult 
integrated into the community with the mind working." 
</P>
<P>
The program is specifically designed for senior citizens, and although most of 
the students at Emeritus are retired and between 60 and 70 years old, there are 
no age or residence restrictions. Most of the classes are free. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students say the program provides a climate conducive to forming 
friendships. Sylvia Rothschild, past president of the 34-member Emeritus 
advisory board, who has taught a class in autobiography writing for 11 years, 
said: "My students write about themselves and share experiences, and from 
sharing they get to feel close. There have been wonderful relationships formed. 
</P>
<P>
"Emeritus really satisfies a need so many people have for contact. It relieves 
loneliness and makes them feel worthwhile. When you take a class, you feel like 
you're going ahead with your life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like a Family' 
</P>
<P>
Bill Elliott, who leads another class, the 25-member women's Lyric Chorus, 
says: "The group is very close, like a family. It's ethnically diverse, the way 
life should be, with people of every background, and we're all there because we 
love to sing together." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, a former professional choral singer with the Fred Waring and Ray 
Charles singers, took over the group in 1986. It frequently performs for local 
nursing homes, church groups and civic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He believes the class helps build self-esteem. "I'm trying to show them how 
good they are and that they can step into a more demanding situation," he says. 
"We've just made our first record, and when they heard the playback, one of the 
ladies said, 'Why, we don't sound old.' It was a big moment for them." 
</P>
<P>
Ellie Mae Cramer, 68, veteran of at least 16 classes, ranging from band (she 
plays trombone and baritone sax) to stress management, said: "When my husband 
died I went into a very deep depression, and I would have committed suicide, 
but my college supervisors got me started with classes. Now I can't learn 
enough or get to school often enough, and I'm a different person. I never 
believed there was this much to life." Cramer's new life has also included an 
appearance on a senior citizen segment of KCBS' "Two on the Town." 
</P>
<P>
Rita Bachtold, equally enthusiastic about her auto and home repair classes and 
their teacher, Bonnie Kramer, said: "Her idea is that a woman can do everything 
she sets her mind to." 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely not a playpen thing," said Harold Jaeger, 82, of his 
Emeritus political science classes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Broad Range of People' 
</P>
<P>
"There's participation in classes, and I never cease to be amazed at the depth 
and breadth of experience in the groups," said Jaeger, a retired labor law 
attorney. "We have a broad range of people who were active in fields like 
finance, statecraft and other disciplines, and it makes for an interesting 
exchange of views. 
</P>
<P>
"In regard to getting some of these old fogies up off their duffs and out doing 
things, I think Emeritus contributes to their longevity and desire to continue 
living." 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger is a member of the school's advisory board, which director Hall said has 
always been an important element of the school. "Mostly it's made of community 
senior activists who want to put their opinions into action. They make a lot of 
excellent suggestions, and some of our new classes are a direct result of their 
input," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall interviews and selects the teachers, working with a Santa Monica College 
committee. Teaching applicants must have a bachelor's or master's degree in 
their subject area as well as experience teaching older adults and "a lot of 
enthusiasm and energy." 
</P>
<P>
"They're paid $30 an hour, and we've had several people who've donated their 
salaries back to the college," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage and family counselor Ruth Dasche, an Emeritus teacher for five years, 
is teaching four classes this year, including the popular "Psychodynamics of 
Assertiveness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Changes' 
</P>
<P>
She said: "My students generally want to learn three things: how to demand 
respect from their doctors and nurses, how to say no to their friends, and how 
to ask their children for what they want. They're proud and independent people, 
not used to asking for help, and what they learn from me and each other assists 
them in making positive changes in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Chandler is one instructor who needs no classroom. Now in his 13th year 
of teaching horticulture at Emeritus, his Monday morning class meets in various 
public and private parks and gardens all over Southern California. It is 
popular with young horticulturists and landscape designers as well as seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler, a former UCLA and Los Angeles City College teacher, said, "We have 
some noted garden designers in the class, some of whom began with my course 
before they ever became professionals." 
</P>
<P>
One star member of the class is eucalyptus expert Grace Heintz, 84, the author 
of "Trees of the Pacific Palisades." 
</P>
<P>
Heintz, a former teacher, recalled with a chuckle how she taught herself to 
ride a bicycle at age 65 because it would be easier to ride around town 
cataloguing trees. She makes presentations and identifies specimens for 
botanical gardens and arboretums all over California. "Phil Chandler," she 
says, "has been a godsend -- he's so knowledgeable."

WORLD CYCLING INVITATIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
ITALIANS USE EXPERIENCE TO TAKE FIRST-DAY LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With everyone shooting for bicycling's top gun, the Soviet Union, Italy used 
its team experience to sneak into contention on the first day of the NEC World 
Cycling Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's events, mostly preliminaries, left the United States and Soviet Union 
battling for team points, with the Soviets taking a 37-29 edge. But without the 
big names of the superpowers, Italy placed 1-2 in two events to take the lead 
with 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual eight-team format, with the top five placers receiving points in 
each event, found several of the world's top track riders trying some 
unfamiliar events on the Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
That was most evident when the Soviets were unsure of how to tackle the 
miss-and-out elimination race -- a non-Olympic event in which the rear rider 
drops out after each lap -- and dropped out without scoring any points. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of an experienced kilometer rider also cost the United States in the 
evening's only final. America's Ken Carpenter, a sprint specialist who recorded 
the night's best 200-meter sprint time of 10.86 seconds about an hour earlier, 
gave the three-lap kilometer a shot and faded in the last lap, losing to 
Canada's Tony Ward. 
</P>
<P>
The kilometer is normally run against the clock, but in this event's format the 
competition was in two-man heats. 
</P>
<P>
The race also provided the evening's most dramatic finish. The final heat 
matched two of the world's best, Australia's Martin Vinnicombe, the 1987 world 
champion and No. 2 finisher in the recent World Championships, and the Soviet 
Union's 1988 Olympic gold medalist, Alexander Kirichenko. 
</P>
<P>
They were riding in a dead heat after two laps, then Vinnicombe edged 
Kirichenko at the finish line. Vinnicombe won in 1:06.40, beating Kirichenko by 
a quarter-second. 
</P>
<P>
In other Friday highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Soviets' Erika Salumayae and America's Connie Paraskevin-Young had the 
top times in the women's sprint trials. They advanced to today's semifinals 
along with Italy's Sara Felloni and France's Isabelle Gautheron. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italy's Marco Villa and Giovanni Lombardi placed 1-2 in the miss-and-out 
and 1-2 in the scratch race to give Italy the team lead. 
</P>
<P>
Racing resumes today at 1 p.m.

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
CAPITALS BEAT FLYERS, WIN FIRST OPENER SINCE '82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Hunter and Mike Ridley scored on consecutive shots midway through the 
second period to lift the Washington Capitals to a 5-3 win over the 
Philadelphia Flyers Friday night at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Courtnall added two goals as the Capitals won their first season opener 
since 1982. They snapped an 0-5-1 stretch in openers with three power-play 
goals and a 44-24 shot advantage over the team that eliminated them in the 
first round of the playoffs last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Washington trailed, 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2, before tying the score at 3-3 when Hunter 
shot a pass from Scott Stevens past Philadelphia goalie Ken Wregget with 11:18 
left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington took a 4-3 lead, Ridley scoring with 10:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
Courtnall scored his second goal with 4:44 left to give Washington its 5-3 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia (0-2) took one-goal leads on goals by Tim Kerr, Murray Craven and 
Mike Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Winnipeg 1 -- John Ogrodnick scored two goals as the 
Rangers opened their season with a win at Winnipeg, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Kisio and Darren Turcotte also scored for the Rangers, who continued 
their hot streak after winning six of their last seven exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Elynuik scored Winnipeg's goal in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
John Vanbiesbrouck blocked 34 shots for the Rangers, including pad saves on 
Brian McReynolds and Paul Fenton from the crease.

KENNEDY'S 24-7 LOSS TO TAFT IS NO MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wouldn't take Sherlock Holmes and his big magnifying glass to deduce what is 
killing the Kennedy High football team this season. 
</P>
<P>
It's as elementary as 2-5-4 (as in 254 yards allowed rushing), and as 
predictable as Taft Coach Tom Stevenson wearing shorts to the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Cougars have no defense against the run. 
</P>
<P>
Taft made that fact perfectly clear once again Friday night in a 24-7 Northwest 
Valley Conference game at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy also had its share of problems on offense after losing star tailback 
Ontiwaun Carter on the final play of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who rushed for 267 yards and four touchdowns last week against 
Crenshaw, was hit on the thigh by a Taft player's helmet and suffered a severe 
bruise that kept him out for the remainder of the game. He finished with 46 
yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's backup, 5-foot-6, 145-pound sophomore Eli Raphael, gained 35 yards in 
10 carries as Taft held the Golden Cougars to 64 rushing yards and 124 total 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win without defense, and you can't win without Ontiwaun," Kennedy 
assistant coach Tom Sams said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (1-3, 0-1 in conference play), which has allowed 1,040 rushing yards, 
certainly was at a loss as to how to stop the Taft running game. The Toreadors 
(2-1, 1-0) punted only once, and that was because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have to say our offensive line and our running backs really jelled as a 
unit tonight and played the type of football we've been playing the last six 
years. It was great to see," Stevenson said. "I was very disappointed Ontiwaun 
got hurt. He's a great athlete. It took a little edge off the game for me 
personally." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson's players didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Taft led, 10-7, at halftime and scored second-half touchdowns on a 13-yard run 
by Steve Lockridge in the third period and a seven-yard run by quarterback 
Edwin Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
Lockridge finished with 58 yards in 11 carries. Taft was led by fullback 
Gregory Bernard, who gained 84 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Four Taft ballcarriers rushed for 30 yards or more, and the Toreadors 
accumulated 311 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreadors drove 90 yards to a touchdown on their first possession, staying 
on the ground for 15 of the 16 plays. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang von Aspe scored the touchdown on a six-yard run, dragging Keith West 
into the end zone. Carlos Lopez added the kick, and Taft led, 7-0, with 45 
seconds left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy countered on the ensuing possession, going 74 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Cougars moved to the Taft 14 in 12 plays, and on third and 10, 
quarterback Tony Vazquez passed to West in the end zone. Kicker Jason Rosen 
tied the score, 7-7, with 7:47 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
On the last offensive series of a first half dominated by time-consuming 
drives, Taft marched from its 32 to the Kennedy three, where Velasco's 
third-down pass fell incomplete in the end zone six seconds before 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreadors settled for a 21-yard field goal by Lopez to take a 10-7 lead at 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had 115 yards in offense in the first half.

WALKER LANDS JOB AS PIERCE SOFTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Walker, a 22-year-old UCLA senior, has been hired to coach the Pierce 
College softball team, replacing John Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
A walk-on coach with no teaching responsibilities, Walker will continue to 
pursue her degree in kinesiology at UCLA while coaching the softball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited because I've always wanted to test coaching out and see if I 
wanted to do it," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a Woodland Hills native and former City Section co-Player of the Year 
at El Camino Real High, went on to become an All-Pacific 10 Conference player 
at UCLA and played on the gold-medal team in the U. S. Olympic Festival this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got a very good track record," said Marian McWilliams, the Pierce 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams interviewed several candidates for the position but said, "None of 
them really fit the bill like Karen did."

KICK-START REVS UP CHANNEL ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Channel Islands High, off to a sluggish start against Westlake, needed a swift 
kick when behind to get going. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders got just that from senior J. Rosario Pina, who booted a 51-yard 
field goal to start Channel Islands on its way to a 31-15 Marmonte League 
victory Friday night at Hueneme High. 
</P>
<P>
"All week I was practicing long kicks," Pina said of his school-record field 
goal. "I thought I helped the team and motivated us to play harder." 
</P>
<P>
After his field goal, which came early in the second quarter when Channel 
Islands was trailing, 7-0, Pina got some help on offense from a bruising 
running game. Tailback Renard Carn rushed 17 times for 82 yards and one 
touchdown. Fullback Pharoh Milner ran 14 times for 63 yards and scored two 
first-half touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake had hoped this game would prove that its vastly improved team could 
play with the big boys -- namely a Channel Islands team that had won two league 
titles in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors' only spark came from junior quarterback Todd Preston, who 
completed 21 of 38 passes for 233 yards and two touchdowns. However, Preston, 
who threw two interceptions, was battered all night as he was continually 
chased from the pocket or sacked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real happy with our defense," Channel Islands Coach Joel Gershon said. 
"Our coverages were good and we were able to put pressure on the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 17-7, heading into the second half, Channel Islands' offense used big 
plays to put the game away. Quarterback Mark Contreras threw 62 yards to wide 
receiver Shawn Young for a touchdown on the Raiders' first possession of the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Channel Islands took possession at the Westlake 45 and 
left the rest to Carn. The junior rushed four times in a row, the last run 
going 21 yards for another touchdown to give the Raiders a 31-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake jumped to an early lead after Channel Islands' first possession 
stalled and the Raiders punted short into a chilling wind. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors took over near midfield and Preston promptly completed a 23-yard 
pass to Seamus Gibbons. One play later, he hit tight end Dave Monheim for a 
seven-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead.

CHAMINADE RUNS OVER SANTA MARIA, 42-23 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Maria High football Coach Barney Eames joked that traveling to Chaminade 
for a game was like playing at Notre Dame with the Pope in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he might have run into something more powerful in Chaminade's running 
tandem of Colin Havert and Felix Goodson. Havert rushed for 185 yards in 22 
carries and scored three touchdowns, and Goodson accounted for 195 all-purpose 
yards and three touchdowns as Chaminade rolled to a 42-23 win. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade's Dan Kelly intercepted Joe Robledo's pass on the game's first play 
and, five plays later, Goodson scored from eight yards. Aaron Weiss picked off 
another pass on Santa Maria's next drive, and Chaminade quarterback Joe Meyer 
hit Goodson with a 71-yard touchdown pass that gave Chaminade a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Havert scrambled 65 yards for another score that gave Chaminade a 20-0 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We played great in the first quarter," Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson said. "Then 
we only played well about 10 seconds of the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
That was about how long it took Havert to score on runs of nine and one yard to 
put Chaminade (4-1) ahead, 35-0. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Dillon, who rushed for 190 yards in 18 carries, ran 89 yards for a score 
and Santa Maria (2-3) added a two-point conversion pass from kicker Pedro 
Moreida to Abdul Lewis in the second half. Then Shane Montgomery caught a 
seven-yard pass from Robledo and Moreida's point-after kick pulled Santa Maria 
within 35-23 with 8:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
But there was plenty more of Goodson -- who had 88 yards receiving and 73 
rushing. A 6-foot-1, 175-pound senior, Goodson answered with an 11-yard run. 
Mike Terzian's point-after concluded the scoring with 3:41 left.

ON THE WATERFRONT: THE INS, OUTS OF LOBSTER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When lobster season opened Wednesday, Dale Sleight was ready. He and his wife, 
Trudy, have spent the past two months building new traps and repairing old ones 
for the beginning of the six-month season. And Sleight, one of an estimated 25 
commercial lobstermen in Orange County, has been busy this week setting 150 
steel traps up and down the coast, hoping to snare his share of the delectable, 
but elusive, California spiny lobster. 
</P>
<P>
The local lobsters will soon start showing up regularly in seafood markets, 
where they sell for $8 to $9, and restaurants. But while lobster season means 
good eating for diners, it means a lot of hard work for fishermen like Sleight. 
</P>
<P>
Every day from October through mid-March, Sleight, a dory fisherman in Newport 
Beach, launches his 18-foot boat an hour before dawn and heads out to sea with 
about 100 pounds of bait. For the next nine hours or so, he makes a 60-mile 
loop, stopping at each trap to re-bait and to retrieve and measure his catch. 
Lobsters that do not measure at least 3 1/4 inches along the length of their 
backs (from eye socket to the rear edge of the shell) must be thrown back. The 
typical lobster runs about one to two pounds. 
</P>
<P>
For Sleight, the average daily haul is about 60 "bugs," as the California 
lobsters are popularly called. Other lobstermen may set as many as 500 traps, 
according to Mike Castleton, a warden with the California Department of Fish 
and Game. For commercial lobstermen, there is no quantity limit. 
</P>
<P>
"I only like to fish 150 traps because I can handle those myself every day," 
says Sleight, who admits that lobstering is a tough business. "It is not the 
glamorous job everyone thinks it is. It is cold and miserable." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem in the lobstering business is poachers. 
</P>
<P>
Sleight sometimes stations his wife, Trudy, on the cliffs near Laguna Beach 
with binoculars to watch the white floats that mark his traps. If she spots 
someone trying to pull up the traps, she calls officials at the Department of 
Fish and Game. Harder to spot are the divers who often raid the traps under 
water, according to Sleight, who has been lobstering for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some lobstermen work at land-bound jobs during the off season, while others, 
like Sleight, make their living year-round as fishermen. Anyone willing to pay 
$200 for a permit, $50 for a license and $165 for a vessel permit can become a 
commercial lobsterman, according to Mike Castleton. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to trap lobsters commercially, but would like to snare two or 
three for dinner, you can purchase a one-day ocean sportfishing license for 
$6.50 (or you can pay $11.75 for a license good from day of purchase through 
the end of that calendar year) and try your luck with a hoop net, according to 
Castleton, who says he has caught many a lobster that way. Hoop nets, made of 
heavy netting strung between two metal rings, can be purchased at bait and 
tackle shops for about $24.95. You tie your bait in the center of the net and 
then lower the net from the 
</P>
<P>
jetty or a boat. Leave it down for about 15 to 20 minutes, then haul it up and 
check it for lobsters. Each person is limited to seven lobsters per day. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a diver, you can take lobsters legally by hand. Limit is seven 
lobsters per person, and a fishing license is required. Lobsters are found in 
15 to 60 feet of water and are most often found in crevices, caves and near 
small openings in the rocks. . 
</P>
<P>
Cruising the channels: Orange Coast College is offering a cruise to the Channel 
Islands aboard the Alaska Eagle, the school's 65-foot oceangoing yacht. 
</P>
<P>
The cruise is limited to nine students, and participants must have at least 
intermediate-level sailing experience. Each night is spent anchored in a cove 
at one of the islands, and there is ample time for exploring ashore. Cost is 
$360 per person, including food. 
</P>
<P>
The participants meet from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 14 and Oct. 21, 
for sail training and cruise planning. The cruise departs Wednesday, Oct. 25, 
and returns on Sunday, Oct. 29. For information call (714) 432-5880. 
</P>
<P>
New club: Plans for a new waterfront boating and social club were announced 
recently in Newport Beach. Called the Harbor Club, the proposed facility will 
be at 3333 W. Coast Highway, said Richard Stevens, president and managing 
director. Charter memberships are now being accepted. For information call 
(714) 646-1989.

Departing from his longstanding policy of remaining neutral in contested 
Republican primaries, Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday endorsed Modesto City 
Councilman Dick Lang in the race to fill a vacant San Joaquin Valley seat in 
the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Lang, the 51-year-old principal of Modesto High School, is one of four 
Republicans and three Democrats running in a special Dec. 5 race to succeed 
former Assemblyman Gary Condit, a Modesto Democrat who was elected to Congress 
last month to succeed Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lang, the other Republicans running to succeed Condit are 
Modesto Mayor Carol Whiteside, Turlock Mayor Brad Bates and Tracy Finance 
Director Zane Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic candidates for the vacant 27th Assembly District, which covers all

NATIONAL CITY VOTERS MAY BE DEALT IN ON CARD ROOM DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Hardie, who earlier this week lost a bid to build a card room for 
legalized gambling in Cathedral City, apparently has persuaded National City 
officials to call a special election in February so that local residents can 
decide if they want a card club in their city. 
</P>
<P>
National City Mayor George Waters said Thursday that Hardie, who is mayor of 
Cathedral City, has agreed to pay the cost of the Feb. 6 election, which could 
be as much as $40,000. Waters said he has met with Hardie "two or three times" 
to work out an agreement on the election. 
</P>
<P>
"But nothing is 100% certain. The council will act on this at our Oct. 17 
meeting, when Mr. Hardie will make a presentation," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed 80-Table Club 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council authorizes the election, voters will be asked to decide 
whether Hardie can include an 80-table club on the ground floor of a high-rise 
hotel he plans to build on National City's waterfront. If approved, it would be 
the largest gaming room in the county. The council has already approved 
Hardie's plans for the hotel, Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, voters in Cathedral City rejected a proposal by Hardie and his 
allies to build a card room in a $25-million resort hotel that would be built 
on desert land owned by Hardie. Cathedral City is between Palm Springs and 
Indian Wells. Hardie is already a managing partner in the 170-table Bicycle 
Club gaming room in Bell Gardens in southeast Los Angeles, the largest in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, who said he was not aware of Hardie's defeat in Cathedral City, said 
that he and other City Council members have not taken a position on the 
National City ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is that I'm going to give the public the opportunity to tell me 
what to do," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "My feeling is that you have bingo, Lotto and horse racing, and 
people like it. That's gambling, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National City Crime Rate 
</P>
<P>
Waters said he was not concerned that legalized gambling might increase crime 
in National City, which has the highest rate of violent crime and overall crime 
in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
According to the San Diego Assn. of Governments, National City averaged 13 
violent crimes per 1,000 population during the first six months of this year. 
This represented an 18% increase over the same period in 1988, said Sandag 
spokeswoman Donna Walko. Countywide, the average for the first half of this 
year was 7.1 incidents of violent crime per 1,000 population. 
</P>
<P>
National City's overall crime rate was 98.6 crimes per 1,000 population during 
the first six months of this year. Police Chief Stan Knee acknowledged that, 
although the figure is high, it represents a 6% decrease in overall crime over 
the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Waters said that a visit to Bell Gardens by the City Council convinced them 
that crime would not be a problem if the card room is approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that they (Bicycle Club) have their own security force. It won't 
impact our Police Department," Waters said. "I talked to the mayor of Bell 
Gardens, and he told me that the police have been there (Bicycle Club) no more 
than two times in about five years." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens City Manager Claude Booker agreed that Hardie's card club has not 
contributed to an increase in local crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Take Care of Own House' 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no increase in major crime, like I hear people talk about..... 
. . . They keep a very large security staff on the premises and take care of 
problems. They tend to take care of their own house pretty good," said Booker. 
</P>
<P>
Waters estimated that the city will get $2 million in revenue each year and 
that 500 new jobs will be created if voters approve the card room. On Friday, 
Hardie said he is in escrow on the property along San Diego Bay, where he and 
other investors have proposed to build the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having the highest crime rate in the county, National City ranks third 
in total revenue. Most of the city's revenue comes from sales taxes derived 
from the auto dealers that line the Mile of Cars on National City Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he is not sure if Hardie will build the 375,000-square-foot 
hotel if the card room proposal is rejected by voters. National City voters 
outlawed card rooms 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hardie declined to say if he would pull out of the hotel project if voters 
reject the card room. But he said that hotels alone "generally are marginal in 
terms of economic investment." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea (for the hotel) was put together for this blighted area, which is 
currently a slaughter house and junkyard for cars. The hotel initially did not 
pencil in as a viable economic investment. Some sort of financial anchor was 
needed, and that was the card room. That's where I was brought in," said 
Hardie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Waters said a survey commissioned by Hardie of 400 local residents indicated 
there is strong support for the card room. However, the gaming club is opposed 
by former Mayor Kile Morgan, and a coalition, which includes several clergymen, 
has been formed to defeat the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said he opposes the card room because "I'm opposed to gambling." Hardie 
said he is "distressed" that the proposed card room has evolved into a moral 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reference in the Bible to gambling. It's a free-choice issue. The 
people should have the right to go bowling, to a football game, shopping on 
Sunday or go play cards if they want," said Hardie. 
</P>
<P>
He added that critics are wrong when they compare card rooms to Las Vegas 
gambling. He said he is in the business of renting seats in his card room, not 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
"In Las Vegas, you play against the house. In California, it's illegal for the 
establishment to participate in a game in any way. We're in the seat rental 
business. You pay $2 or $3 every half hour to play. It's nothing like gambling 
some place else. I resent people telling me that what I'm doing is not right," 
Hardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Broderick, manager of the gaming registration program at the state 
attorney general's office, said the card room measure would only have to be 
approved by a simple majority for it to pass. If it is approved, all owners, 
investors and managers associated with the card room would have to undergo a 
background check by the state in order to obtain gaming registration 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers hired by the game room usually have to register with the city and have 
to be cleared by local police departments, Broderick added.

PICTURE PERFECT?; 
</P>
<P>
EX-WAITER SAYS HIS SYMBOLS CAN SERVE AS UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drawing from experience, Tom Zavalani figures he has come to the rescue of 
strangers in a strange land. 
</P>
<P>
The retired San Fernando Valley waiter has invented a do-it-yourself pictograph 
language that he claims can eliminate communication barriers that frustrate 
travelers, immigrants and others who do not speak a common tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"Man has yearned for a universal language since the Tower of Babel," said 
Zavalani, 69. "Happily, that goal is now within reach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quickly Mastered 
</P>
<P>
Zavalani has assigned 600 hand-drawn "universal" symbols to such things as man, 
woman, automobile and daylight. The simple sketches can be grouped into 
sentences by using other symbols that signal such things as action, tense and 
location. 
</P>
<P>
His hieroglyphic system can be mastered in as little as 30 hours, Zavalani 
said. That is a vast improvement over other picture-based communication systems 
that use thousands of symbols and can take months or years to learn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once his "Jet Era Glyphs," as he calls the vocabulary, are memorized, all a 
user needs to successfully communicate is a pencil and a piece of paper -- and 
a stranger who also has committed the 600 symbols to memory. 
</P>
<P>
Albanian-born, Tomor Sali Zavalani sat down at his dining room table in 1960 to 
begin sketching out his pictograph system. He said he was motivated by a 
language problem he experienced upon immigrating first to Canada and, later, to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, he had studied philosophy and law but had been turned into a refugee 
by World War II. Over here, he yearned for a white-collar job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked as Waiter 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped to go into the travel business. I read every book I could on that 
business," he said. "But I couldn't find a job in the industry. I couldn't 
speak much English. I eventually got a job as a waiter." 
</P>
<P>
He later became fluent in heavily accented English and found jobs in such 
places as the old Dino's Lodge on the Sunset Strip. But Zavalani never forgot 
one thing he had seen in the travel guide books: the tiny symbols used to 
denote accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be a little black faucet that meant the hotel rooms had cold water 
and a red faucet to show they had hot water," he said. "A little car meant 
there was limousine service from the airport. A little golf club meant there 
were golfing facilities there. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'I should invent a sign language with symbols like that.' It 
took a lot longer than I thought it would . . . there was a lot of trial and 
error involved. But that's what I did. I'm not as dumb as some headwaiters 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Final Word 
</P>
<P>
Zavalani finished three months ago when he concocted his last symbol: 
interlocking rings that signify the word marriage. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, he compiled his hand-drawn sketches and instructions into a 
267-page Jet Era Glyphs manual. It illustrates how thoughts can be strung 
together in the past, present or future tense in simple sentences or in more 
complex forms such as poems. 
</P>
<P>
Because the pictographs are intuitive -- the symbol for letter looks like an 
envelope -- they are easy to recognize, he said. Other symbols used to 
designate pronouns or concepts such as here and there can be memorized after 15 
hours of instruction and another 15 hours of self-study, Zavalani predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Although several linguists have complimented Zavalani on his work, his sign 
language remains untried. 
</P>
<P>
Zavalani said his next step is to persuade educators to let him test it with 
small groups of children and disabled people. After that, he wants to teach it 
to an adult test group -- perhaps travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
"My system is so easy to grasp," he said. "It could become part of high school 
curricula everywhere. It can be adapted into other languages and taught in 
other countries. People such as hotel clerks and policemen who know it could 
wear badges that identify them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic Forecast 
</P>
<P>
"It will be five years or more before it would be in widespread use. But if I 
live like my grandfather, I'll see it. He lived to be 98. My father lived to 
80." 
</P>
<P>
Language experts who have seen Zavalani's system say it seems thoughtful and 
thorough. But they are skeptical it will catch on as quickly as Zavalani 
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
If it catches on at all. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of would-be universal languages proposed over the last 300 years have 
failed. The one that has come the closest, Esperanto, peaked in about 1930. 
Written in 1887 as a politically neutral vocabulary drawing from a mixture of 
European, Latin and Oriental languages, Esperanto today has perhaps a million 
or so speakers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm rooting for him," said Elizabeth Helfman, a Connecticut author who has 
written three books about pictographic sign languages -- including one on the 
most widely used system, Blissymbolics. It is a comprehensive but complicated 
system first devised about 40 years ago by Australian C. K. Bliss; today it is 
used by many people with speech handicaps or learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubts Voiced 
</P>
<P>
"I think Zavalani's is a good system. But Bliss had a head start. I don't think 
there is much chance of it catching up with Bliss," Helfman said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell T. Osguthorpe, associate dean of education at Brigham Young University 
in Utah, said the strength of Zavalani's system is its simplicity. But he 
suggested that other advances, such as use of computers, hold more promise for 
the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
As for travelers or others struggling with an unfamiliar language, it might 
also be a struggle to find someone fluent in Jet Era Glyphs, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're the only one who knows it, it's not of much value," Osguthorpe said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CSUN AGAIN TO GIVE GRADE CASE EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Personnel Board has granted Cal State Northridge officials a second 
chance to present evidence against a Pan-African studies professor who was 
fired last year and then reinstated after a judge found him innocent of charges 
that he sold grades. 
</P>
<P>
The state board in June ordered Cal State Northridge officials to give Eleazu 
Obinna back his job based on recommendations by an administrative law judge. 
The judge, after hearing seven days of testimony, ruled that there was not 
enough evidence to support university allegations that, in the 1988 spring 
semester, Obinna offered his students A grades for selling $100 worth of raffle 
tickets to benefit a foundation he headed. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna, a 17-year tenured professor at the university, was instead suspended 
for 90 days for unprofessional conduct for "selling tickets in connection with 
a class." Obinna had said in testimony that he never offered students grades in 
exchange for selling raffle tickets, but that students volunteered for the 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting this week, the board granted a request by Cal State Northridge 
attorneys that the judge in the case reconsider some of the testimony presented 
during hearings held in November and February, said Duane Morford, chief of 
policy for the state Personnel Board. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been scheduled to rehear the case, Morford said. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna could not be reached for comment.

YOUNG SHOOTING VICTIM IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The victim of a fatal shooting in Mira Mesa was identified Friday as Barbara 
Pacheco, 13, a student at Challenger Junior High School, a deputy San Diego 
County coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was found dead about 4:30 p.m. Thursday, after police were summoned to 
a home in the 10800 block of Parkdale Drive, just around the corner from the 
school. The coroner's deputy said the girl died of a single shot in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco had been visiting a classmate, a 12-year-old boy, who authorities said 
placed a 911 call to the San Diego Police Department at 4:20 p.m., saying that 
a friend had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Friday that the homicide unit is investigating, although officials 
believe the gun was fired accidentally.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECTS DISAPPEAR AFTER BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of several Rowland Heights apartments were evacuated early Friday as 
members of a special weapons and tactics team searched for an armed robber who 
had taken more than $21,000 in cash from a nearby Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects were found during the 4-hour operation in the 1900 block of South 
Batson Avenue, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred at 9:15 a.m. when a man with a handgun walked into the 
bank, on Nogales Street and Colima Road, and moments later left with the cash. 
Police were not sure if man asked for the money verbally or with a note. 
</P>
<P>
He got into a gray Ford Thunderbird with the license plates covered and was 
driven away by another man. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later the same car was seen speeding into the parking lot of 
the nearby Batson Avenue apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen sheriff's deputies and SWAT team members who were called to the scene 
immediately began evacuating residents on both sides of an apartment that was 
listed as the home of the person who rented the Thunderbird, said Rafael 
Estrada of the Sheriff's Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not certain that the two suspects ever entered the apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who lives in the apartment told authorities she never saw anyone. 
Sheriff's deputies do not believe the woman was connected to the crime.

WITNESS CLAIMS EX-ATHLETE SAID HE KILLED WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key witness against a former high school star wrestler testified Friday that 
the defendant admitted to killing one of the three people in Clairemont he is 
charged with murdering. 
</P>
<P>
Before a packed courtroom, Rodney Nicholson, 24, who said he also goes by the 
name of Rodney Almond, testified that Christopher Box, 20, told him he had 
stabbed April Gilhousen, 20, during a struggle in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Also slain Aug. 9 were Gilhousen's 3-year-old son, Bryan, and Kevin Chandler, 
29, who lived with Gilhousen. The bodies of the boy and Chandler were found in 
separate locations on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard, and the woman's body was found 
in her house. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing for Box is likely to conclude next week. The audience 
was filled with his friends from Clairemont High School, where he was a star 
wrestler and football player. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reminded of Oath 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, who is in jail on drug charges, came into the packed courtroom of 
San Diego Municipal Judge Fred Link and initially told Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Lorraine Rooney he could not see Box in the courtroom when asked to identify 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Nicholson, you're under oath," reminded Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney requested a private conference with Nicholson, and 10 minutes later, 
Nicholson was escorted back into court and identified Box, saying he was "a 
good friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said he was arriving at the house where the victims were killed when 
he encountered Box outside with a baseball bat. He said Box had "a mean look on 
his face" and hit him twice on the arm with the bat, causing severe pain. 
</P>
<P>
He said Box ran after him but he eluded him and hid in a store. Nicholson said 
he later hitched a ride to the house of a friend, Dennis Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Some time later, Nicholson said, he, Burns and another man returned to the 
house because Nicholson wanted to get his car back, which he had parked in the 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
While they were in the car, Nicholson said, he saw Box leave the house with 
another man. Box's co-defendant, Manuel Flores Jr., 17, has a murder case 
pending in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apologized for Hitting 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said Box approached him in the car and apologized for hitting him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, home boy. I didn't know it was you. I thought it was somebody else," 
Nicholson quoted Box as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Box told him he thought Nicholson was someone named Charles and that it 
involved "a deal that went bad." Rooney asked Nicholson if Box meant a drug 
deal, and the witness said he did not know. 
</P>
<P>
Box gave Nicholson a $100 bill to pay for an X-ray, said Nicholson, and then 
accompanied him to a store, he said. It was then that Box admitted to stabbing 
April Gilhousen, Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they got into an argument. He said she got stabbed," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Box told you he had killed April?" Rooney asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, to the best of my knowledge," replied the witness. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination by Charles Adair, Box's lawyer, Nicholson added: "He 
mentioned something about April coming at him with a knife, and a struggle, and 
her being stabbed." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor asked Nicholson if he had ever told police that Box remarked 
that he had killed everyone in the house, but the witness said he couldn't 
remember saying that. 
</P>
<P>
The father of the slain boy, Michael Ross, testified that he once saw Box at 
the house where the occupants lived, but he didn't know who he was at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Box remains in County Jail in lieu of $2 million bail.

SDG&amp;E TAKEOVER POSSIBLE BUT NOT WITHOUT A BIG FIGHT, CONSULTANT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government agency that tries to take over San Diego Gas &amp; Electric would 
face a "bear of a fight," according to the Seattle-based consultant who on 
Friday told San Diego County Water Authority board members that 
municipalization of SDG&amp;E is economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth J. Mellor cautioned that "it's not fun" to tangle with an 
investor-owned utility such as SDG&amp;E. "If there's no community interest in 
public ownership then the thing is going to die right here," said Mellor, an 
executive engineer with R.W. Beck &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear on Friday if a new government agency -- or a group of existing 
bodies -- would try to take over SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done is undertake a study to provide some information to the 
general public," water authority Chairman Dale Mason said Friday. "It is now, I 
think, in a different court." 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies around the county now must "consider whether or not they 
want to be in public power," said Mason, who agreed that the matter would die 
unless "the public makes some noise . . . and lets their leaders know that, yes 
indeed, they would like the savings." 
</P>
<P>
The water authority spent $200,000 on the preliminary study that suggests 
municipalization is "economically feasible and attractive." The study suggests 
that a government agency could acquire SDG&amp;E for between $2.8 billion and 
$4.4 billion, and subsequently reduce average electricity rates by between 5.6% 
and 10.4% during the first 13 years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E officials on Friday argued that the water authority's study grossly 
underestimates the cost of acquiring SDG&amp;E. The $4.4 billion acquisition 
price that Beck &amp; Associates identified as the "high-end" price is about $2 
billion below what the utility would sell for, SDG&amp;E Assistant Treasurer 
Malyn K. Malquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The study's high-end purchase price ignored $1 billion of SDG&amp;E's 
short-term liabilities and various tax-related liabilities that would drive the 
price up another $1 billion, Malquist said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under their best case, they're saying they can deliver 2.5% to 8% rate 
reductions," said Karen Hutchens, SDG&amp;E director of regional governmental 
affairs. "But that assumes the report is absolutely perfect -- and it ignores 
the billions of dollars we're talking about. Those are fatal flaws that just 
pop out at you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Expected in 1990s 
</P>
<P>
The Beck study acknowledged that SDG&amp;E will face problems during the 1990s, 
no matter what the ownership structure. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's past practice of purchasing electric power from other utilities 
leaves it with an old, inefficient group of power plants that "raises concerns 
about future reliability, future availability . . . and environmental 
concerns," Mellor said. 
</P>
<P>
A municipal utility in San Diego would not have easy access to cheap, federally 
subsidized hydropower that is available in the Pacific Northwest, Mellor said. 
That finding clashed with views held by some proponents of municipalization. 
</P>
<P>
And, SDG&amp;E is landlocked when it comes to transmission lines that could 
link the local utility to utilities with excess electricity, Mellor said. 
Eventually, that power glut will evaporate, forcing whomever owns the local 
utility to build new plants or find a new source of purchased power. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those problems, Mellor maintained that a government-owned electric and 
gas utility could deliver lower rates to San Diego's consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Snow tied those lower rates to the "inherent" ability of a publicly owned 
utility to charge lower rates. That ability is driven largely by the absence of 
dividend payments to shareholders, the elimination of federal and state income 
taxes and the public sector's ability to use tax-free borrowings to build 
future plant, Mellor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condemnation Proceedings 
</P>
<P>
If a public agency were to pursue municipalization, the price paid for 
SDG&amp;E's assets would be set through condemnation proceedings in U.S. 
District Court in San Diego or through a complicated process involving the 
state Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Mellor predicted that a price could be determined within two years, an estimate 
that Hutchens described as "overly optimistic." For example, Hutchens said, 
negotiations leading to the creation of the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District took 23 years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
A proceeding before the PUC "is likely to be somewhat quicker but that's never 
been tried before," said Hutchens, who predicted that commissioners probably 
would set a purchase price that was higher than one generated by a federal 
court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Zach McReynolds, a vice president with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, a New 
York-based investment firm that assisted with the study, defended the 
$4.4-billion estimate as solid. "It is unlikely that anyone would set a price 
higher than this one," McReynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
The water authority will issue a final report after a blue ribbon committee 
reviews the preliminary study issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the water authority has spent $300,000 on a lawsuit initiated by 
SDG&amp;E. The utility contends that the water agency lacked the authority to 
fund the municipalization study.

CRASH COURSES HELP FIRM TIES BETWEEN JEWS, THEIR RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Students of Rabbi Daniel Epstein's crash course in Hebrew are facing their 
final exam -- Yom Kippur. The students -- including children, lawyers and 
computer specialists -- have learned Hebrew phonetics and the meaning of 
religious phrases. They have been taught that apples and honey symbolize the 
sweetness of a new year. Some have even practiced blowing the shofar, a wind 
instrument made from a ram's horn that signifies spiritual awakening during the 
High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, these students at the Beth Jacob Congregation-Irvine will 
have a chance to show what they have learned at a Yom Kippur service for 
beginners, an unusual service catering to unaffiliated Jews -- those who do not 
belong to a temple. The service will be held at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the High Holy Days -- which began with Rosh Hashanah, the 
Jewish New Year, on Sept. 29, and concludes with Yom Kippur, the Day of 
Atonement -- more congregations across the nation have been offering such 
"crash courses" in Hebrew and Jewish history. Their aim is to help strengthen 
the connection between Jews and their religion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
The High Holy Days, in particular, provide Jewish leaders, concerned about the 
dilution of Jewish heritage and religious observances in America, with a 
special opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Jewish Federation of Orange County, so many 
normally non-observant Jews want to attend Rosh Hashanah services that many 
temples must move their services to theaters or hotels. It is a time of year 
when unaffiliated Jews often consider whether to join a particular synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
Such beginners' services and courses are "really catching on across the 
country," said Epstein, who leads the modern Orthodox congregation of 125 
families in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the outreach movement, operated by the New York-based National 
Jewish Outreach Program, aims to stem what Epstein called an "alarming" trend 
of attrition and assimilation among Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In the greater Los Angeles area, according to the Jewish Federation Council of 
Los Angeles, 30% to 40% of Jews marry non-Jews. In outlying areas, that rate 
rises to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, only 10% of an estimated 100,000 Jews are affiliated with a 
synagogue and "the attrition rate is spiraling," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The beginners' services and the outreach programs are part of the worldwide 
Baal Teshuvah movement, which aims to return Jewish people to their roots and 
promote observance of traditional rituals. So far, it has swept tens of 
thousands of Jews in Israel -- where most Israelis are not religious -- and has 
reached major Jewish centers in the United States, Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"What's at stake is the continuity of the Jewish people," said Rabbi David 
Eliezrie of the Chabad Center of North Orange County, a strict branch of 
Orthodox Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
The Chabad Center in Yorba Linda also offers Hebrew crash courses. This week, 
the center held a symposium to introduce and explain the traditions of the high 
holidays "so people won't have the what-page-are-we-on-in-the-prayer-book 
blues," Eliezrie said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to giving crash courses in Hebrew before major Jewish holidays, the 
Beth Jacob Congregation in Irvine has started outreach programs such as the 
Sabbath Youth program, "Turn Friday Night into Shabbos." The programs, 
organized through the National Conference of Synagogue Youth, include parties 
and weekend seminars where Jewish identity and Judaism are subjects of 
discussion and debate. 
</P>
<P>
In order to attract novice worshipers to High Holy Day services, Epstein posted 
and sent out thousands of flyers to attract those who may have fallen away. 
</P>
<P>
"At last," says the flyer, "A High Holiday service for the novice worshiper." 
</P>
<P>
The flyer continues: 
</P>
<P>
* "Prayers and Rituals Explained. 
</P>
<P>
* Biblical Insights. 
</P>
<P>
* Historical Overviews. 
</P>
<P>
* Over 200 Shofar Blasts. 
</P>
<P>
* Questions and Answers." 
</P>
<P>
"The image a lot of people have of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is the coming 
to shul (temple) and sitting, listening and observing through a long service," 
Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The beginners' service, by contrast, is participatory and informal. He said it 
is especially appropriate to launch such beginners' services during the High 
Holy Days because "that's the time for teshuvah, repentance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance to Reach Out 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, it's a chance for us to fulfill our obligation to reach out 
and care for our fellow Jews. If we don't reach out to other Jews and give them 
the opportunity to experience and confront their Judaism, then we are deficient 
in our religious observance," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Information on crash courses sites at several Southland locations is available 
by calling 1-800-44-HEBREW. 
</P>
<P>
One student said she is particularly looking forward to this year's High Holy 
Days services. Irvine bank attorney Julie Greenfield, 38, said she has 
gravitated toward traditional values since her divorce two years ago. The class 
provided her with her first instruction in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I'm an expert on Hebrew -- don't forget this was a crash course," 
she said. "But there's a feeling when you are Jewish and the tradition goes 
back thousands of years. It's a sense of belonging, a sense of family. It's 
roots, heritage and a very wonderful experience."

JEWISH RECONSTRUCTIONISTS PRINT PRAYER BOOK FOR MODERN TIMES

<P>
A new prayer book recently issued by the Jewish Reconstructionist movement is 
breaking new ground in American Judaism in its concern for feminist language, 
ecology and personal spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a do-it-yourself prayer book. . . . It doesn't have to be used only in 
synagogues, so more Jews will use it at home," said Rabbi David A. Teutsch, 
editor-in-chief of the prayer book. 
</P>
<P>
Called in Hebrew "Kol Haneshama," the prayer book was introduced in September. 
It will be used first on an experimental basis for Sabbath eve and synagogue 
services in the approximately 60,000-member Federation of Reconstructionist 
Congregations and Havurot. 
</P>
<P>
Reconstructionist Judaism was founded by Mordecai Kaplan in 1940. The movement 
does not see the Jewish religion as having been supernaturally revealed to 
Moses but rather as a civilization that adapts tradition and beliefs to 
changing times. 
</P>
<P>
The new prayer book is the second such book for the Reconstructionists since 
1945. According to Teutsch, the book reflects the changes that have taken place 
in the American Jewish community since 1945, while also addressing 
Reconstructionist concerns on current issues. 
</P>
<P>
"When our first siddur (prayer book) was published nearly half a century ago, 
Jews were struggling to assimilate into North American society. Today a great 
ethnic awakening among Jews has taken place, and many Jews are trying to find 
their way into Judaism. This prayer book is for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The book is suited for use by individuals and small groups, known as havurots.

YOM KIPPUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most solemn day on the Jewish calendar is Yom Kippur (yome kih-POOR). The 
Day of Atonement, which will be observed this year from sundown Sunday to 
sundown Monday, concludes the 10 High Holy Days of self-scrutiny and 
repentance. 
</P>
<P>
* TRADITION: According to rabbinical accounts, it is the day on which Moses 
came down from Mt. Sinai with the second set of Commandment tablets and 
announced God's pardon to people for worshiping a golden calf. Mentioned in the 
biblical book of Leviticus (23:26-32) along with other holy days, Yom Kippur 
has come to be observed as a day of fasting, rest, meditation and prayer for 
God's forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
* OBSERVANCES: Religious Jews will excuse themselves from their workplaces 
during the 24-hour period of Yom Kippur. Synagogue services on Sunday evening 
feature the Kol Nidre recitations, which start with the cancellation of all 
unfulfilled promises to God made rashly or unwittingly during the previous 
year. Synagogues will be at their fullest for a series of daytime services 
Monday; members have made their reservations far in advance, but some temples 
will have unassigned seating. Rites end with the sounding of the shofar, a 
ram's horn, and the traditional prayer, "Next year in Jerusalem."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A University City man and a woman described as his transient companion were 
arrested early Friday in Spring Valley on suspicion of running a 
methamphetamine manufacturing lab out of a motor home, which contained 1 1/2 
pounds of the drug, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank C. Puente, 34, and Deborah Terlaje, 24, were booked into County Jail on 
suspicion of manufacturing the drug and of being under its influence, said a 
spokesman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Richard Bolter from the Lemon Grove substation arrested the two after 
responding to a citizen's complaint about 12:30 a.m. that a small motor home 
was "driving up and down" the 1600 block of Grand Avenue in Spring Valley, the 
spokesman said. Bolter pulled the driver over and reportedly smelled ether 
emanating from inside the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics Task Force agents confiscated the motor home, deputies said.

<P>
Listen up, because he's only going to say this once. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Miller has never been blown off any pitching mound. 
</P>
<P>
"There was only 40,000 people there that day, yet I've gotten about 100,000 
people claim they saw it," recalled the former San Francisco Giants pitcher of 
the 1961 All-Star game at Candlestick Park. "They talk like I was blown from 
the mound to the left-field fence. They say all kinds of funny things and they 
are all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth inning, with runners on first and second and the 165-pound Miller 
facing Roger Maris, a wind gust hit him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blast, it caught me by surprise, it knocked me off balance . . . " 
Miller recalled, then sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never lost my feet. I wavered back and forth like a tree, but I never 
fell. Truth be told, I may have moved four inches." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's pitch to Maris was a strike, but plate umpire Stan Landes had seen 
Miller move and called a balk, which eventually helped the American League make 
the score 3-3. Miller protested that it was a wind-aided balk. Landes refused 
to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the National League won in 10 innings, with the help of Roberto 
Clemente and Willie Mays, the next day's largest headline turned Miller and the 
ballpark into legends. 
</P>
<P>
"Miller Blown Off Mound," it read. 
</P>
<P>
"And from there, the story has never died," said Miller, now 61 and living in 
retirement near Sacramento. "People talk about Candlestick Park, they talk 
about that story." 
</P>
<P>
The story launched Candlestick Park's reputation as baseball's only stadium in 
which the field reminds players of amusement park rides, the dugouts remind 
them of prisons, and the bullpens remind them of nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the fears that the Chicago Cubs will have trouble this weekend when they 
visit the Giants, beginning tonight, for the middle three games of a National 
League Championship Series that is tied at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Is Candlestick's reputation for wind and cold and craziness unfounded? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was asked how often he ventures to Candlestick to watch his old team 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," he said. "You kidding me?" 
</P>
<P>
A nation is expecting the joke to be on the Cubs beginning today, even though 
they will match Rick Sutcliffe (16-11) against the erratic Mike LaCoss (10-10). 
</P>
<P>
Although they won half of their six regular-season games here this season, the 
Cubs were outscored, 29-18. The Giants had the best home record in the league 
at 53-28. Since Manager Roger Craig's first full season in 1986, they have not 
lost more than 36 games in a season here. 
</P>
<P>
And in the stadium's 30-year history, no team has a winning record against the 
Giants here. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's tonight's human edge. LaCoss, like all Giant pitchers, loves 
it here. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's nice and cold, a little foggy, about a nice 25-m.p.h. wind," he 
said earlier this week. "Then I hope all that sand and paper and hot dog 
wrappers starts blowing in the hitter's face." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. He wasn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
"Then maybe get some birds trapped in the swirling wind here, all flying around 
and swooping down . . . " he said. "Gosh, that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly wouldn't be a surprise. At least not to the Cubs, whose manager, 
Don Zimmer, coached third base here a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one time when I was with the Giants, we were playing the Cubs, and 
it was cold and windy and there were birds everywhere," Zimmer recalled. "The 
birds were diving down at different players. They were all over the place. I 
stand at third base and pull my hat down over my ears and plant my feet as 
solid as I can. 
</P>
<P>
"Then on the mound I hear Ed Lynch, the pitcher, cussing and moaning. Then here 
comes his hat, rolling past me, and next thing you know, it's up against the 
left-field fence. That hat was moving." 
</P>
<P>
What can Zimmer tell his young players about this park, located on land jutting 
into San Francisco Bay? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't talk about it," Zimmer said. "We just get through it." 
</P>
<P>
They say that. But teams rarely do that. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is what I hear down on first base," the Giants' Will Clark said. 
"And all I hear is guys talking about how much they hate the place, how they 
want to get their one hit and get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for this, beginning with the minute the players take the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they will be cold. Even if the temperature doesn't dip to 
Candlestick's famed mid-summer night 45 degrees, they will be cold. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys start moaning the minute they walk in the clubhouse, and all before 
the game they are putting on layers of T-shirts and sweat shirts and 
turtlenecks," said visiting clubhouse manager Harvey Hodgerney. "They let the 
cold get to them before anything else." 
</P>
<P>
That is partly because once they hit the dugout, for most of them there is no 
turning back. The ballpark's visiting dugout is not equipped with heat, and is 
the only one in the league not connected to a warm clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The dugout is on the third-base side, and the door to the clubhouse hallway is 
down the right-field line, so if you're a pinch-hitter and need to get warm . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget it," said Cub infielder Domingo Ramos. "To go get a cup of coffee and 
get your hands thawed, you got to run all the way across the field. By the time 
you get back, you've missed two innings." 
</P>
<P>
Hodgerney does his best, sending down jugs of coffee to the dugout throughout 
the game. Counting pregame and postgame coffee, Hodgerney goes through 25 pots 
a night, more than four times what is consumed in the warm Giant dugout 
connected to the warm Giant clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no heat in the visiting dugout when the park was built, and we have 
seen no reason to add any since," said Matt Fischer, Giant media relations 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. If they did, visiting clubs might even play the game with all of 
their available players. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys are always running up and spending the game in the clubhouse," Hodgerney 
said. "Then it always happens -- somebody runs in here looking for a 
late-inning pitcher, and the guy is sitting in his underwear." 
</P>
<P>
Who crowds the clubhouse quickest? 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers," said Hodgerney, in his eighth year. "The Cubs stay on the field 
the longest." 
</P>
<P>
The only other place for players to go during games is the bullpen, but here it 
really is a pen -- an ugly box enclosed by wire mesh. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the 'penalty box,' " Giant relief pitcher Craig Lefferts said. "You go 
down there and feel like you're locked in while you freeze." 
</P>
<P>
But the unsafest place of all here is the field. Earlier this year, former 
Dodger and current San Diego announcer Rick Monday captured the wind's effects 
on routine plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going back for a fly ball, but it kept blowing and blowing," Monday 
recalled. "I kept my eye on the ball, and before I knew it, I had run through a 
gate in center field and was on the other side of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"But then the ball gets blown back over into play. Just then, the wind blows 
the gate shut. I'm outside of the fence while the ball lands in center field. 
While the runners are going around the bases, I'm thinking, 'I hate this 
place.' " 
</P>
<P>
And why don't the Giants? 
</P>
<P>
Easy. Manager Roger Craig won't let them. 
</P>
<P>
"First thing we tried to do when we came here was get rid of all that stuff 
about this being a negative park," Craig said of the 1986 season. "I told our 
players, 'It's a major league park, we play at least 81 games here, it's a 
place that represents a great city.' 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'This park is our home. And I don't want to hear any more 
complaining.' If they didn't like it, we would find them a new home." 
</P>
<P>
Complaining? Who's complaining? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually glad people think I really got blown off the mound," Stu Miller 
said. "If not, I would have spent the rest of my life hearing, 'Stu who?' "

CLOSED CASE AS BLUE JAYS SEAL OFF A'S; 
</P>
<P>
SKYDOME ROOF, MOUTHS OF PLAYERS SHUT DURING WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a cue from SkyDome's roof, the retractability of which was retracted 
Friday night, the Toronto Blue Jays also shut up and reacquainted themselves 
with the preferred method of making noise during a baseball playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
No more complaining about how Rickey Henderson didn't slide into second base. 
</P>
<P>
No more complaining about how Dave Parker didn't run after hitting his home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
For once, the Blue Jays actually did some sliding and running of their own. 
Some scoring, too. A four-run fourth inning and a three-run seventh inning were 
worth more than a thousand words for Toronto, which ruined Oakland's designs on 
a sweep by beating the Athletics, 7-3, in Game 3 of the American League 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, the maligned Yellow Jays, that lily-livered, 
weak-in-the-intestine Canadian club, rallied from a 3-0 deficit, stranded six 
Athletic baserunners in scoring position and received, yes, clutch relief 
pitching from Jim Acker and Tom Henke to cut Oakland's series advantage to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, however, it appeared as though the hotdogs were about to put the 
Blue Jays through the grinder again. Rickey Henderson walked in his first 
at-bat, doubled his next time up, stole third base -- his seventh steal of the 
postseason -- and ended up scoring two runs. Dave Parker hit another home run, 
his second in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the fourth inning, the Blue Jays trailed, 3-0, and the A's 
weren't above flaunting it. 
</P>
<P>
As Parker chugged past second base -- attention, Blue Jays: the Parker home-run 
trot doesn't get any faster -- he began jawing at Kelly Gruber, the Toronto 
third baseman who'd suggested that a few Toronto pitches be directed at 
Parker's person as a response to his Game 2 "showboating." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Gruber said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, before his first at-bat, Henderson turned to his verbal 
sparring partner in Oakland, Blue Jay catcher Ernie Whitt, and picked up where 
the last taunt left off. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Whitt also said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But let Henderson tell the story, which is always more fun, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I said hello to him," Henderson said. "He didn't say hello. Each day is 
different. You do what you have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I was going to steal off him, but he knows I'm going to steal off 
him. I've probably stolen 75 bases off him. He can be ticked off. I'm going to 
have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson got his stolen base, a steal of third before scoring on Carney 
Lansford's third-inning single. He also got a hot dog thrown at him, courtesy 
of some literal-minded Blue Jay fan. 
</P>
<P>
But worse than that, the A's incurred their first defeat in an American League 
playoff game in two years. Last season, Oakland swept its way to the World 
Series, defeating Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the streak began in the fourth inning when A's starter Storm Davis, 
perfect through three innings, walked leadoff hitter Lloyd Moseby. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up singles to the next two hitters, Mookie Wilson and Fred McGriff, to 
load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
He yielded a sacrifice fly to George Bell. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up a double to Tony Fernandez, who accounted for two Blue Jay runs when 
Oakland right fielder Jose Canseco bobbled the ball for an error. 
</P>
<P>
He surrendered a final bloop single to Whitt, which scored Fernandez to break a 
3-3 tie and cap a four-run Toronto inning. 
</P>
<P>
Three innings later, Davis would stray into further trouble, and this time, 
unlike most of 1989, the A's bullpen would be unable to bail him out. 
</P>
<P>
After a leadoff double by Fernandez and a one-out intentional walk to Gruber, 
Davis was replaced by Rick Honeycutt, the Oakland set-up man who faced three 
Blue Jays in Game 2 and couldn't set one of them down. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 3, Honeycutt duplicated the feat. 
</P>
<P>
First, he gave up a single to Manny Lee to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Next came another single to Junior Felix, which scored Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
And then a walk to Moseby, forcing home Gruber and breaking the game open. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson added a run-scoring single against Honeycutt's replacement, Gene Nelson, 
and then spent most of his first postgame hour reprising the role he often 
played during his run with the New York Mets -- Philosopher Mook. 
</P>
<P>
And with Wilson, none of this stuff about hotdogs ever cut the mustard. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought hotdogging was just a sign of confidence or cockiness or 
whatever you want to call it," he said. "I think it's been overplayed a little. 
These guys have been doing it their whole career." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson did approve of how his teammates took this time to put up and shut up. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else," he said, "I think it's important to forget what 
opposing players do and what's gone on in the past. The important thing is 
scoring runs -- not how many bases you steal or what you do when you steal them 
or what somebody says." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking along those same lines, Gruber and Whitt observed moments of silence 
when confronted by their Oakland foils, face to face, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not intent on carrying on something," Gruber said. "I'm not interested in 
any squabbles. That's not me. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy just asked me a question (in Oakland), and I answered it truthfully. I 
guess you can appreciate that. I guess I could've lied. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stated the fact that I don't like hotdogging and that Dave kind of took 
a day to get around the bases. When I was asked about it again (at a news 
conference Thursday), I didn't want to back away and look like a coward to you 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
Gruber chalked it up to "the heat of the battle. Some things are said and some 
things are done." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Whitt, who loudly complained of Henderson's tip-toeing into second 
base on a Game 2 stolen-base attempt, was the one doing the tip-toeing after 
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Give him credit," Whitt said. "That's his style. I don't like it, a lot of 
people don't like it. But it's his style . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The game is different than when I broke in. There's more showmanship all 
around. It might be (because of) TV, it might be to get the attention of the 
fans. We've got some guys on this team who hotdog, and the fans love it. 
They're the ones who pay to watch us, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Whitt's version of his home-plate exchange with Henderson also differed a tad 
from Rickey's. 
</P>
<P>
"He said hello and I said hi," Whitt said. "We exchanged pleasantries." 
</P>
<P>
And what of that game-winning single off Davis in the fourth inning? Did Whitt, 
0 for 11 against Oakland basestealers, feel any sense of vindication? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even think about it," Whitt said. "My job is to drive the run in." 
</P>
<P>
Quotewise, the Blue Jays were a lot more interesting when they were losing. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Key wound up the winning pitcher after weathering six wrenching innings. 
He gave up seven hits and walked two and let the leadoff hitter reach base 
three times -- twice on doubles. 
</P>
<P>
But he finagled his way long enough to get Manager Cito Gaston to the seventh 
inning, where the Toronto manager could turn to his relief-pitching ritual -- 
set-up man Acker for two innings, followed by closer Henke for one. 
</P>
<P>
Acker also yielded a leadoff double, to pinch-hitter Ken Phelps in the seventh, 
but then came back to retire the next three A's in order. Likewise, Acker 
walked Mark McGwire to open the eighth inning, then retired the next three 
hitters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
Henke worked a perfect ninth inning, and Toronto had extended one of the more 
nonsensical winning streaks of this season: With the retractable SkyDome roof 
closed, the Blue Jays are 11-0 -- 13-0 if one counts games when the roof was 
rolled shut while the game was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
American League President Dr. Bobby Brown has instructed that the roof be 
closed for Games 4 and 5, too, so maybe the Blue Jays really do have a chance 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, for one night, they proved what can be accomplished when they shut 
their mouths and concentrate instead on shutting the other guys down.

PHILLIPS GOT A BUM STEER AT THE START; 
</P>
<P>
BUT THE SON ALSO RISES WITH DENVER'S DEFENSE 
</P>

<P>
He used to be known only as Bum Phillips' son. Now he is being hailed as the 
man who has brought order out of chaos for the Denver Broncos' defense. 
</P>
<P>
When Wade Phillips served as defensive coordinator of the New Orleans Saints 
from 1981 to 1985, few people noticed that his unit finished among the top five 
in the National Football League three times in five seasons. Because his father 
was the Saints' head coach, the popular assumption was that he owed his job to 
nepotism. Besides, the Saints were so bad that not many folks paid attention to 
them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Phillips didn't even emerge from anonymity when he served as the 
Saints' interim coach after his father retired with four games left in the 1985 
season. Somebody had to take over, and Bum's son was as convenient a choice as 
any. Since the Saints were going nowhere, who really cared what coach finished 
the season? 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the Saints were 1-3 under Wade Phillips, and after that, he 
went looking for other work. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if it might be a blessing of sorts in that it seemed to give 
Phillips a long-awaited chance to establish his identity. As it turned out, he 
only flitted from the shadow of his father to that of Buddy Ryan, who hired him 
in 1986 as defensive coordinator and linebacker coach of the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan had been the Chicago Bears' defensive coordinator when they won Super Bowl 
XX, and a clash of monumental egos had led to a bitter feud with Bear Coach 
Mike Ditka. As much credit as Ryan took for the Bears' success, and as much as 
he felt he had to prove in his new job, he might have found it hard to let any 
of his assistants in Philadelphia play starring roles. 
</P>
<P>
In Phillips' three seasons under Ryan, the Eagles rose from the depths to the 
NFC East championship last year. But then Bronco Coach Dan Reeves called with 
an offer to be his defensive coordinator. As solid as Phillips was with Ryan, 
he jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' revitalized Bronco defense will be tested Sunday by Jim McMahon and 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision, because I knew they'd have a good football team in 
Philadelphia for years to come," Phillips said this week by phone from Denver. 
"I liked Philadelphia, too. But the Eagles' defense is always going to be 
Buddy's defense, and that's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in Denver, I have the opportunity to do more things on my own. Dan 
(Reeves) doesn't tell me how to do things. Being the defensive coordinator here 
is a much easier situation." 
</P>
<P>
While pleased to be his own man at last, Phillips emphasized that his 
experience under Ryan was a positive one. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot from Buddy," said Phillips, 42. "Especially the 46 defense 
that he put in with the Bears. A lot of teams play it now, over half I would 
guess, but Buddy is the guy who really knows it. We use parts of it, but only 
the parts that apply to our talent." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' mention of talent hit upon the basic difference between his defense 
and that of his predecessor in Denver, Joe Collier. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Collier was considered one of the better defensive coaches in the 
NFL. But his teachings in Denver for 20 seasons were predicated on complicated 
schemes, and when the talent level fell off last year, the Broncos' defense 
plunged to 22nd in the league, including 27th against the run. 
</P>
<P>
Under Phillips, the defense has climbed to 13th overall and, amazingly, No. 1 
against the run. Denver's opponents have gained just 324 yards on the ground in 
four games, and that is perhaps the biggest reason the Broncos lead the AFC 
West with a 3-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
After Collier was fired, columnist Jim Lassiter wrote in the Colorado Springs 
Gazette Telegraph: "It didn't require a Ph.D to play Collier's defense, but it 
probably helped to have one to understand it. Suffice it to say that Collier's 
schemes required players to think a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Bronco defenders had to have the mental discipline to hold a territory, read 
the play and, as the offensive set changed, make correct adjustments. The old 
defense was what coaches call a 'situation' defense. Down and distance not only 
determined the call but dictated the personnel on the field. The best defenders 
often were on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys was the use of Karl Mecklenburg, the Broncos' three-time Pro 
Bowl linebacker, at all seven positions aside from the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Mecklenburg was outstanding wherever he played, but he said recently, 
"Sometimes you got all tied up in knots just trying to figure out the call we 
were in. Now the knots have been cut. Our new philosophy is to make offenses 
adapt to us rather than us trying to adapt to a different offense every week." 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Greg Kagen, who will miss Sunday's game because of a knee injury, 
said, "I love the new defense. Playing where I play is still like being a 
one-armed paperhanger, but I'm not just sitting in there keying. I'm getting 
after people." 
</P>
<P>
If Phillips had his druthers, he would employ the basic 4-3 alignment that 
worked for Ryan in Chicago and that he used under Ryan in Philadelphia. 
Instead, because of talent limitations up front, he stuck with the 3-4 that he 
inherited from Collier. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had four real good linemen, we'd probably play the 4-3," Phillips said. 
"But I figure I have no choice but to utilize the personnel we have. 
</P>
<P>
"I like man-to-man coverage in the secondary, too, because that's the best way 
to shut down a passing game. But if you don't have man-to-man cornerbacks, you 
can't do it. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're more of a zone team now. Basically, we play a basketball zone. I call 
it a match-up zone. We don't have great cover guys at the corners, and we don't 
have fast linebackers, either." 
</P>
<P>
Of Mecklenburg's less-demanding role, Phillips said, "He just plays two or 
three positions now. He's basically an inside linebacker, but he goes outside 
sometimes, and in pass-rushing situations, he may be an outside down lineman." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ryan, Phillips doesn't believe in a gambling defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't blitzed a whole lot," Phillips said. "We haven't had to. Blitzing 
is taking a chance. Luckily, we've been ahead most of the time, so situations 
for blitzing haven't come up that much." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Broncos' top ranking against the run, Phillips said, "That's what we had 
to address, our No. 1 priority. We felt that our offense was better than our 
defense and that we had to get them the ball more often." 
</P>
<P>
Blitz or no blitz, Simon Fletcher, a fifth-year outside linebacker, leads the 
league with 6 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to point out one guy who has made the biggest difference, it would be 
Fletcher," Phillips said. "I think he's going to be a great player." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Broncos' pass defense, more speed would help. It ranks 12th in the 
AFC and 22nd in the league, a dropoff from fifth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But the Broncos' rankings against both the run and the pass are misleading. 
Because they have usually been ahead, their opposition has had to do an 
uncommon amount of passing. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise -- probably on the entire team -- has been cornerback 
Tyrone Braxton. After two seasons in which he never started a game, Braxton has 
made three interceptions and returned one for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy Robbins has run one back, too," Phillips said. "It comes from being more 
aggressive instead of worrying about what coverage they're supposed to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Bum Phillips, 66, who coached the Houston Oilers before going to New Orleans, 
is living in retirement on his ranch in Sugarland, Tex., near Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"He has 500 head of cattle and gets up at 5 every morning," Wade said. "He 
watches all our games on satellite and keeps calling me and asking me why I did 
this or did that. He's still a head coach in a lot of ways." 
</P>
<P>
Wade was asked if that might be in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most coaches have that as their ultimate goal," he said. "Naturally, 
it's a goal of mine. Ever since my junior year in college (he was a linebacker 
at Houston), I've known I wanted to coach. 
</P>
<P>
"My four games as interim coach didn't mean much, though. I wasn't going to be 
the head coach, and everybody knew it. It was good experience for me, but it 
was still Bum's team and his players. He's not only my dad; he's an idol of 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing is that you have to be in the right place at the right time, and 
who knows whether that will ever happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Reeves is one insider who wouldn't be surprised if it happened soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Wade is a great coach," Reeves said. "I get tired of saying my assistants are 
good and then losing them, but he definitely will be a head coach some day."

CLIPPERS GET SHORT WITH BENJAMIN; 
</P>
<P>
THEY WANT TO SIGN CENTER FOR A MAXIMUM OF TWO YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's only one bald, 7-foot big fella of a National Basketball Assn. center 
in this town now, or at least will be as soon as free agent Benoit Benjamin and 
the Clippers agree on a contract. But for how long remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few months ago, the Clippers had hoped to lock their fifth-year team 
captain into a long-term deal. But now, so fed up are they over what they say 
is Benjamin's continuing lack of maturity, they refuse to negotiate anything 
for longer than two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they would prefer just one more season, choosing the gamble of losing 
the right of first refusal when Benjamin would become an unrestricted free 
agent next summer, over giving him another multimillion-dollar deal and getting 
a replay of his last four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't figured out what motivates Benoit, but it's certainly not a contract 
staring him in the face," general counsel Alan Rothenberg said Friday, when the 
Clippers opened training camp at Cal Poly Pomona, minus holdout Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared to death that he'll sign for several million dollars, and then 
(we'll) get more of the same. We want to see him play 82 games and practice 
hard in between, and we'll take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Rarely has any Clipper official been so outspoken about Benjamin, who for years 
has been accused by coaches in and out of the organization of, among other 
things, loafing during games and practices. Events over the summer apparently 
served as the final straw for several Clipper staff members, among them 
Rothenberg, who had been one of Benjamin's strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin has known since April, when Larry Fleisher died, that he would need a 
new agent. A three-man team consisting of lawyers Henry Holmes, Barry Mallen 
and personal manager James Casey was not put together until last week. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the Clipper staff said he saw Benjamin about two weeks ago and 
that the center looked about 15 pounds over his season-ending playing weight of 
250. Benjamin was at his best in the last 45 days of the 1988-89 season and 
said his reduced weight had made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin's association with boxing promoter Don King, who is still hoping to be 
certified as an NBA agent, and his joining Mike Tyson's entourage for a fight 
in Atlantic City, N.J., struck the Clippers as something less than serious 
dedication to basketball. They figure Benjamin needs maturity and not the 
sideshow of a King promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing a glimmer of hope at season's end, I feel disappointed at what 
transpired during the summer," Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Clippers are concerned with giving Benjamin too much security. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fearful that he'll go back on his merry business and do the same thing for 
another four years," the former club president continued. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disappointment. I had really hoped -- maybe I didn't believe it -- that 
his excellent performance in the last 25 games was a sign that he was maturing, 
that one day he would grow up and everything would be fine. But watching his 
actions this summer, it's been something different." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Clippers know they need Benjamin this season. Barring a trade -- 
crank up the Danny Ferry rumors? -- it will be Ken Bannister and Martin Nessley 
at center in camp. Charles Smith, an all-rookie selection last season at 
forward, has added 11 pounds of muscle, mostly to his upper body, and would 
play center at 238 if asked, but it's not his natural position. 
</P>
<P>
That means they plan to keep Benjamin, still officially Clipper property, for 
1989-90, even if it's at a steep asking price. Whether they would match an 
unexpected offer sheet is not such a sure thing anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said he is not averse to a one-year deal, but the initial $1.25-million 
offer, tendered last spring to retain rights to the restricted free agent, does 
not come close to cutting it. He refused to say how much Benjamin, who could 
not be reached for comment, wants to accept the one-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Holmes, insisting that Benjamin has been working out and is in fine shape: 
"Ben's feeling is that this is going to be a long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning, who had knee surgery last season, will commute to camp about 
three times a week while living in his new $2.9-million home in Hermosa Beach 
and continuing rehabilitation at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in 
Inglewood. His status for joining preseason workouts with the Clippers is 
doubtful, his due date for a return to game action even more uncertain. "I 
would like to be back by December," Manning said. "That's me. But with an 
injury like this, you really can't pinpoint a date." 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Dowell and Torgeir Bryn, free agents expected to be in camp, were 
no-shows. Dowell failed his physical examination because of a knee problem, and 
Bryn could not get out of his contract in Belgium. No roster replacements are 
forthcoming. . . . The Clippers briefly looked into moving training camp to UC 
San Diego before returning to Cal Poly Pomona. The two-a-day practice schedule 
will normally be 10 a.m. to noon and 5 to 7 p.m., with the evening session open 
to the public.

LAKERS' CAMP OPENS ON SOUR NOTE; 
</P>
<P>
FAILURE TO ACQUIRE TIMBERWOLVES' MAHORN UPSETS WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The bags under Jerry West's eyes were more pronounced than usual Friday 
morning, the result of a late-night negotiating session during which the Laker 
general manager tried one last time before the start of training camp to 
acquire the power forward he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Although West would not identify the player or team involved in the talks on 
the eve of the club's first practice, Rick Mahorn of the Minnesota Timberwolves 
has long been the object of West's attention. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday morning came and went, and the Lakers signed starting power forward 
A.C. Green to a four-year contract reportedly worth $6 million. That put the 
Lakers over the salary-cap limit, which means they will be unable to trade for 
Mahorn or any other player without giving up a player of equal monetary value. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Lakers offered two first-round draft choices, a 
second-round pick and a player -- either center Mychal Thompson or Mark 
McNamara -- for Mahorn, a tough, defensive-minded and, some say, thuggish 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
West talked only in generalities during the Lakers' first practice at the 
University of Hawaii. But he was clearly exasperated at not getting his man. 
"This was the year that was the most personally frustrating for me because we 
wanted this player very badly," West said. "I spent three months on the phone, 
including last night. We made an offer to a team that I simply can't believe 
they'd turn down. We gave that team a chance to build something. 
</P>
<P>
"This player conceivably could have been a starter for us. We were willing to 
take a gamble. But this morning was the deadline, and I don't feel good about 
it. As far as I know, the deal is very dead. We don't have the money for this 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we'd trade one of our younger players for this player. They 
never asked for that, and we never offered." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' salary-cap restraints do not preclude their pursuing other trades, 
but West said the team now probably will wait until close to the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'd really like to do is go through training camp before deciding," West 
said. "It might be fun to have younger players -- until May (playoff-time)." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the negotiations with Green were put on hold because of an 
unusual contract demand that neither West nor Green would divulge. Green, 
however, said the request had nothing to do with salary. 
</P>
<P>
Green will earn slightly more than $1.3 million this season. He earned $269,000 
last season. Green benefited from the recent increase in player salaries. Jon 
Koncak, the Atlanta Hawks' backup forward, started the upsurge by signing an 
offer sheet from Detroit for $2.3 million, which the Hawks matched. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who plans to become a minister after finishing his basketball career, 
said he will donate at least 10% of his salary to his church. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quintin Dailey's problems continue. The newly signed Laker guard, who missed a 
team meeting Thursday night, left the first practice Friday morning after 
barely an hour, complaining of stomach pains and dizziness. Before the morning 
workout, Dailey said he had missed his flight from Los Angeles Thursday to 
attend to his wife, who, he said, is having complications during pregnancy. "I 
was worried about her," Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley called the first practice "shoddy." He said several 
players were out of shape, among them Dailey and guard Larry Drew, another 
former Clipper. Drew missed part of practice with cramps in both of his calves 
but later returned. "This was the first time in training camp history we ever 
lost two guys in one run (up the court)," Riley said. . . . Magic Johnson said 
his left hamstring injury has healed, and he left reporters with an intriguing 
aside: "When it's all over and done, I'm going to buy this team," he said. 
"I'll let you know in November." 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott's left hamstring, which he also hurt last June, is not totally 
healed. Said Scott: "It felt good. The only thing is, it got a little tight 
after a while. I should be all right." . . . Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, fulfilling 
his 20-day contract obligation as a special assistant coach, spent most of his 
first day watching from the sidelines, although he also threw up a few sky 
hooks alone at a corner basket.

A.J. Foyt, who escaped serious injury in a crash earlier this week in 
Charlotte, N.C., said he doesn't remember the stock-car accident that knocked 
him unconscious.

<P>
Foyt was released from Charlotte Memorial Hospital Friday and immediately left 
for his home in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, however, he said, "It's the first time I've had an accident 
where I don't remember what happened. . . . Whatever I hit, I hit real hard. I 
feel pretty rough right now, and my neck is pretty sore. It's all swollen up 
and bruised on the right side. I know it does hurt."

The Alberta government announced it has taken over the Gainers Inc.

WEEKEND RACING AT SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
THIS FUTURES MARKET IS BOOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Charlie Whittingham frequently deals in futures, not to be confused with 
soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
While Whittingham tries to add to his accomplishments at Santa Anita this 
weekend, he also will be thinking about Paris, where another Whittingham future 
from Europe will run in the Arc de Triomphe, France's richest race. 
</P>
<P>
After Golden Pheasant runs in the $1.3-million Arc Sunday, he will be headed 
for the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes at Gulfstream Park Nov. 4. Then 
the 3-year-old colt is expected to move on to Whittingham's barn as a candidate 
for next year's Strub Stakes and Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
By winding up in California, Golden Pheasant will be closer to his 
equal-partner owners, Wayne Gretzky of the Kings and team owner Bruce McNall. 
McNall has already won one Arc, with Trempolino, a horse he bought shortly 
before the Longchamp race in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Whittingham has had talented horses from abroad, but this year's 
group seems to be exceptional. Whittingham has already picked up Oczy Czarnie, 
shortly after the filly won a stake at Arlington International Racecourse. He 
also has River Warden, a winner in France before he ran poorly in the Arlington 
Million. River Warden has been invited to the $500,000 Oak Tree Invitational a 
week from today, but he has been sent to the San Luis Rey Downs training center 
and won't run. 
</P>
<P>
Mill Native, who is the high weight for Sunday's $100,000 Koester Handicap at 
Santa Anita, was put in Whittingham's care after winning last year's Arlington 
Million. Whittingham will also saddle Peace in the Koester, which is at one 
mile on the turf. Others in the 10-horse field are Sabona, Mister Wonderful, 
Truly Met, Mi Preferido, Warned, Political Ambition, Pranke and Trokhos. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Golden Pheasant, trained by Jonathan Pease, had an eventful route to 
the Arc, most of it not of his own doing. 
</P>
<P>
As a yearling, Golden Pheasant was purchased for Josephine Abercrombie by Brian 
Sweeney at a Kentucky auction. Abercrombie was prepared to go to $70,000 for 
the Caro-Perfect Pigeon colt, but had to pay only $44,000. Sweeney said that 
Golden Pheasant had been sick during Keeneland's select summer sale, which 
accounted for the price when he went through the ring at a lesser auction. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant never ran in the United States and was sent to Clive Brittain, 
who was Abercrombie's European trainer. 
</P>
<P>
A rift was building between Abercrombie and Brittain, who was upset that she 
was selling off a few of her horses without offering the stock to some of 
Brittain's other clients. The conflict reached a peak when Abercrombie sold the 
talented Mountain Kingdom. Brittain reportedly told Abercrombie to get another 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Enter McNall, who liked what Golden Pheasant had done in his second race, 
finishing a strong second to Old Vic, one of Europe's outstanding horses. 
McNall bought Golden Pheasant, probably for more than $500,000, eventually made 
Gretzky a partner and wanted Brittain to continue training the colt. Brittain, 
however, was still furious about Abercrombie unloading another of his horses, 
so Golden Pheasant was sent to Pease, after making an interim stop in John 
Gosden's yard. 
</P>
<P>
After one victory and three seconds in four starts, Golden Pheasant's last race 
was his most impressive. At 14-1 at Longchamp, where the Arc will be run, 
Golden Pheasant handed Nashwan his first defeat. Nashwan, considered one of the 
best European horses of the decade, finished third at 1-5 and isn't running in 
the Arc. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant's victory didn't come too soon, as far as Gretzky was 
concerned. The colt's record was marked by one excuse after another after those 
second-place finishes, and Gretzky was weary of the alibis. 
</P>
<P>
"If my aunt wasn't my aunt, she might be my uncle," said Gretzky, remarking 
that all wasn't going as expected before Golden Pheasant's big victory over 
Nashwan. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cauthen has the mount on Cacoethes, the California-bred who is running in 
the Arc de Triomphe in France. . . . Young Mother, who is trying to become the 
15th female to win the race, will be one of the favorites, along with Cacoethes 
and Aliysa. 
</P>
<P>
On the Line, the favorite for the Breeders' Cup Sprint four weeks from today, 
runs against the highly regarded Rahy and three others at Santa Anita today in 
the Ramser Handicap, the first graded stake of the Oak Tree season. . . . Neil 
Drysdale, who trains Rahy, will be at Belmont Park to saddle Prized in the 
$1-million Jockey Club Gold Cup. . . . Drysdale will be represented by Sabona 
and Political Ambition in the Koester. 
</P>
<P>
With Steinlen not running in today's Kelso Handicap at Belmont, the high 
weights will be Wanderkin and Highland Springs, each carrying 118 pounds. . . . 
Of the 12 horses invited to the Oak Tree Invitational, Great Communicator, 
Hawkster, Lively One, Pasakos, Pay the Butler, Pleasant Variety, Saratoga 
Passage and Warrshan are expected to run. Colorado Dancer, a filly, will run if 
she isn't saved for the Yellow Ribbon on Nov. 12. . . . Great Communicator ran 
second to Nasr el Arab in last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
Annoconnor, carrying high weight of 121 pounds, has four opponents for today's 
$200,000 California Jockey Club Handicap at Bay Meadows. In Extremis is headed 
for the Laurel D.C. International on Oct. 22.

SAILING : MALE-FEMALE COMPETITIVE GAP MAY BE CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two events off Newport Beach recently indicated that the competitive gap 
between male and female sailors may be closing. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Franta of Balboa Yacht Club, sailing the Olson 30 Mas Rapido, posted a 
second and then three firsts in winning the Women's Ocean Racing Series' 10th 
annual championship last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The women sailed nine boats in four races and used spinnakers. They have been 
doing that for 10 years, but Shannon Aikman, president of the women's group, 
said that while they're racing, the women can still sense the male owners 
biting their nails, hoping their boats will return intact. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks earlier, Doug Rastello of Newport Beach had won the Prince of 
Wales Trophy, emblematic of the United States Yacht Racing Union's national 
match-racing championship. 
</P>
<P>
Rastello dominated the event, but had to beat a woman, J.J. Isler of San Diego, 
to qualify for the West Coast slot. 
</P>
<P>
And in one of Rastello's races, he squeezed his opponent, Joe Tomlinson of the 
Massachusetts Bay Yacht Club, up past the starting line near the committee boat 
before the gun. Tomlinson apparently panicked and T-boned the committee boat. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman noted: "If one of us did that, we'd never have another event." 
</P>
<P>
Women are generally underrated as sailors but, except for lacking strength for 
certain duties, some skippers welcome them as crew members because, as one once 
said, "they try so hard." Isler, the wife of America's Cup campaigner and 
world-class match racer Peter Isler, is particularly competitive in keel boats. 
</P>
<P>
Rastello, president of DVM Development in Newport Beach, hadn't sailed 
seriously since serving as Rod Davis' tactician aboard the Newport Harbor Yacht 
Club's notoriously slow 12-meter Eagle in the 1986 America's Cup challenge 
trials at Fremantle, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fairly burned out after the America's Cup," he said. "I decided to take 
a work break." 
</P>
<P>
This time, with a crew of Scott Mason and Skip Beck, Rastello and the fleet 
sailed Etchells-22s. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the boats and we knew the water, but we also spent a lot of time 
practicing," Rastello said. "We were just flat-out faster than the other guys 
-- the complete opposite of Eagle. It was a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Rastello had a 10-1 record in the seven-boat fleet, clinching his victory after 
only three days of the five-day series. 
</P>
<P>
He also has placed second and fourth in two Congressional Cups, but it was his 
first Prince of Wales title after two seconds and a third -- and a victory by 
his younger brother, Mark, last year. 
</P>
<P>
A woman has never won the event, but it may be only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in joining the Women's Ocean Racing Series, may call (714) 
645-3700. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica Bay, there is the Women's Sailing Assn., which sponsors a 
summer series -- won by Janet Klose -- and a Super Bowl Race Clinic Jan. 28. 
The WSA may be contacted at (213) 392-6298 or (818) 786-8173. 
</P>
<P>
Rastello's win notwithstanding, the newest hot sailor on the West Coast might 
be Larry Klein of the San Diego Yacht Club. Klein won the renewed Ficker Cup 
match-racing series last weekend to qualify for Long Beach Yacht Club's 
Congressional Cup next March. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, who also won the Etchells-22 and the J-24 World Championships this year, 
defeated four contenders for an invitation to sail in the 1990 Congressional 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Runner-up was Mark Golison of Alamitos Bay Yacht Club, followed by Kimo 
Worthington of California Yacht Club; Steve Grillon, King Harbor Yacht Club, 
and J.J. Isler. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The World Match Racing Conference and the International Yacht Racing Union have 
joined forces to ensure order in that growing level of competition. Hal Lane of 
Long Beach, chairman of the WMRC, said: "Rather than fight 'em, we decided to 
join 'em -- and we joined 'em on our terms." The WMRC will continue to run its 
events under IYRU sanction, but the IYRU will administer the skipper rankings 
and appoint delegates of the WMRC to serve as committee members, with the aim 
of broadening the base of competing skippers from the current hard-core elite. 
In exchange, the IYRU will continue to provide judges for the events. 
</P>
<P>
Georgs Kolesnikovs, who with crewman Steve Pettengill this year broke the 
135-year-old record for sailing from New York to San Francisco around Cape 
Horn, is still in the Bay Area living on his catamaran Great American. He's 
trying to raise funds to produce a video of the voyage and interest some 
publisher in a book he's writing. "In the meantime," he writes, "I am setting 
another record -- for lasting almost an entire year on nothing but negative 
cash flow. Fortunately, there were plenty of freeze-dried foods left over from 
the trip." Nevertheless, Kolesnikovs concluded, "I remain convinced that I am 
the most fortunate man on earth."

GIANTS' WILLIAMS IS CATCHING ON TO BIG LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this week, when asked if Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia Phillies used 
to be his hero, San Francisco Giants third baseman Matt Williams gave less than 
an All-American answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "To be honest, I never watched baseball when I was 
growing up. Until I was drafted, I didn't know which team was in which league." 
</P>
<P>
But after a double, a homer and four runs batted in during the first two games 
of the National League Championship Series -- not to mention flawless fielding 
-- at least one opposing player thinks Williams finally knows he's in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the biggest surprise for me the first two games has been Williams," 
said Rick Sutcliffe, who will start for the Chicago Cubs against Mike LaCoss in 
tonight's Game 3 at Candlestick Park. The series is even at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that he was a good defensive player," Sutcliffe added, "but . . . 
early in the year when we faced him, and even in spring training, he chased an 
awful lot of bad pitches. Right now, he's a much different player than he was 
back then. I think to begin with, our game plan was to pitch around (Will) 
Clark and (Kevin) Mitchell. We knew we had an idea on how to get Williams out. 
But right now, we're not sure how to get him out." 
</P>
<P>
Giant Manager Roger Craig said: "We knew it was there," referring to Williams, 
23, who totaled 44 homers this year at triple-A Phoenix and in San Francisco. 
"He's got the potential to hit as many homers as Mitchell, he's that strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once he gets a fresh start and plays all year, you'll see a different 
hitter. He'll drive in a lot of runs and hit a lot of homers and hit in the 
.270 to .280 range." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, Williams will finish this postseason not forgetting his .202 
major league average, nor the fact that late in the season, he was removed for 
pinch-hitters such as Mike Laga. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more laid back now, not as worried about things," Williams said. "I've 
realized, I can still make everybody forget what I haven't done." 
</P>
<P>
Giddy with their offensive success in this series' first two games -- a 
combined 28 runs on 44 hits -- neither the Giants nor the Cubs held workouts 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't as simple as that. 
</P>
<P>
Craig arrived at Candlestick Park for his news conference only to discover that 
his parking space had been taken by a certain 47-homer man. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it, Kevin Mitchell took my parking space," said Craig, who 
felt better when he discovered Mitchell was taking an hour of batting practice 
underneath the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin is unusual, he does things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Cub Manager Don Zimmer, meanwhile, didn't cancel his off-day session until a 
couple of hours before it was scheduled. He wanted to cancel it earlier but 
became confused. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to work out, but a couple of weeks ago (Cub General Manager) Jim 
Frey told me that it would be good for the press, and I said fine," Zimmer 
said. "But then (Thursday) I asked the Giants if they were going to work out, 
and Roger said no. So I figured, I wouldn't work out either, because I didn't 
want to in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said he is looking forward to the Cubs facing Giant starter Mike LaCoss 
today. Not because they are enemies, but because they are a different kind of 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We are close friends, but recently I squeeze-bunted on him and won a game that 
way," Zimmer said. "After the game he was saying to me, 'You dirty so-and-so, 
you'd better not squeeze on me again.' 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope I get a chance to do it again (in Game 3)."

Daren Wilkinson used to think a lot about what he had to do this year. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody was wondering, asking, whispering. Could this guy really become 
Orange Glen's starting quarterback and successfully replace Cree Morris, who 
led California in passing last season? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the answer is yes, but not in quite the same spectacular fashion as 
Morris. Take Orange Glen's 7-6 victory Friday night over host Poway in front of 
about 1,500. Wilkinson finished 10 for 12 passing for 110 yards. But the trick 
for Orange Glen was a balanced effort, both offensively and defensively. 
</P>
<P>
There was Ryan Strathearn, Orange Glen's powerful fullback, who carried 29 
times for 116 yards. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Orange Glen's defense, which stood tall with less than five 
minutes remaining. Poway linebacker Chris Rzewuski had just recovered a fumble 
to give his team first and 10 at the Orange Glen 34. Three plays later, Poway 
had only advanced to the 31. Greg Brown's 48-yard field-goal attempt was short, 
and Strathearn's running carried Orange Glen the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
So Wilkinson has a little help. And he doesn't worry about comparisons with 
Morris. What's past is past. 
</P>
<P>
"During the beginning of the year, it was tough," Wilkinson said. "Everybody 
was wondering if I could fill Cree Morris' shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he wouldn't mind getting a few more opportunities to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I didn't like (the balanced offense)," he said. "But I have to 
accept it because we're getting victories with it." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen is 4-1, 2-0 in Palomar League play. Poway is 3-2, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen's defense has allowed just 41 points in five games. A typically 
alert play came early in the fourth quarter when Poway appeared to be on its 
way to scoring. On third and nine from Orange Glen's 45, Poway quarterback Tom 
Fischer threw for Aaron Kelly, but defensive back Gabriel Munoz dove to tip it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense won the game for us," Orange Glen Coach Rob Gilster said. "They've 
been playing good all year long." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen's scoring drive was as smooth as they come. It happened on the 
first possession and covered 80 yards in 12 plays. First, Strathearn did his 
thing, running through small gaps in the line and then running over an 
assortment of tacklers. He had the ball in his hands on the first six plays of 
the drive, running five times for 22 yards and catching a seven-yard pass from 
Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson passed for 11 yards to Noel Toloumu and 14 to Ryan Gustine to keep 
the drive moving before Toloumu went nine yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Poway wasted little time retaliating. Fischer found a play that worked -- a 
keeper around left end-and used it several times successfully until running 
back Chris Quiseng went off tackle to the right side to score on third and six 
from the Orange Glen 13 with 30 seconds left in the quarter. A bad snap 
prevented the extra point, which proved the difference in what turned into a 
defensive game.

USD POISED TO IMPROVE TO 5-0 BUT STILL WARY OF POMONA PITZER

<P>
On paper, this afternoon's 1:30 game against Pomona Pitzer looks to be a sure 
thing for the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But, as nearly every college football coach will protest, games are not played 
on paper, and there is no such sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
"(A letdown) is a normal concern," USD Coach Brian Fogarty said. "Anytime you 
come off a couple big wins and play a team that is not traditionally tough is 
always a concern." 
</P>
<P>
USD is 4-0 and ranked No. 4 in the NCAA Division III West Region. The Toreros 
have more victories than any of the teams ahead of them -- No. 1 Iowa Central 
(3-0), No. 2 Minnesota Concordia Moorehead (3-0-1) and No. 3 Wisconsin 
Platteville (2-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
USD's record is its best since 1981, when it went 9-0 before losing, 31-14, to 
St. Mary's, a Division II team, the final week of the season. That team did not 
go to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This year's record is also the best in seven years under Fogarty, who can even 
his USD overall mark (now 30-31-2) with a victory today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an uphill battle since that second year when we went 1-8," Fogarty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
USD has not lost to Pomona since 1971, when it was a club team. The Toreros 
hold a 16-1-1 series advantage over the Sagehens, who are 1-1 and coming off a 
24-14 loss to Occidental two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But there is still concern. "They put a lot of people on the line and make it 
difficult to run," said USD fullback Todd Jackson, who is averaging 21 carries 
and 112 yards per game and 5.3 yards per rush. "I think we're looking forward 
to it. The challenge is there." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Jackson said, "Pomona's on their way. We have to take them just 
like all the others." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is led by running back Chris Smith, who is averaging 175 yards per game. 
Quarterback Gregg Silver also can play receiver, as he did earlier this year 
when he caught a 55-yard touchdown pass from backup Mickey Graville.

READING COMES TO LIFE FOR CHILDREN HUNTING FOR TREASURE IN MUSEUM MAZE

<P>
Bea Thurber was tired of seeing kids throw aside books in favor of video games. 
Shouldn't reading be as much of an adventure as playing Super Mario Brothers? 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a local artist, architect and writer, Thurber created a 
life-size, three-dimensional adventure book. The Creative Journey Maze lets 
children trek through its winding corridors, creating their own adventure story 
as they go. 
</P>
<P>
The maze will open to the public today at the Children's Museum of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As they enter the 600-square-foot creation of vividly painted passageways and 
alcoves, children are challenged to find three clues that will help them 
recover the queen's stolen jewels. The clues are numbers that unlock a safe 
where the missing jewels are kept. 
</P>
<P>
On their journey, the young travelers encounter a variety of choices as they 
read the signs posted to guide them. Should they travel by plane or train? 
Follow a trail through the Bat Cave or brave the Woodsman's Lodge? Take advice 
given by the red parrot, or his contrary counterpart, the blue parrot. 
</P>
<P>
"Explore. But remember, people have disappeared in here," warns one sign. There 
are so many twists and turns in the maze, it is not hard to believe the 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
Should the players reach the maze's end without finding the treasure, the game 
is not necessarily over. They can simply return to the beginning and start 
their journey again, this time choosing a different route and creating a 
different story about the queen's lost jewels. 
</P>
<P>
"For many kids today, reading is something that they only do in school," said 
Barbara Broderick, a museum executive. "This way, reading is seen as something 
outside the classroom that is a good, fun thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Thurber, a reading teacher and the museum's director of exhibits, said she had 
become increasingly distressed with the mostly "dry, boring, meaningless" books 
students were reading in school. Often, the author's narrative didn't allow 
them to participate, she said. Thurber wanted students to determine the outcome 
of their stories. 
</P>
<P>
The maze allowed her to do that by combining reading with a three-dimensional 
structure. While traveling through the maze, children are asked to read signs, 
make choices, and create a story rather than let an author make the decisions 
about whether the best route will take them through a jungle, a desert or a 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
In the maze, each child becomes the main character. The story unfolds as the 
youngster decides which paths to take and what will happen. He could even 
become lost in an Arabian marketplace or get eaten by a grizzly bear. He might 
have to escape from an Egyptian tomb, or a bawdy late-night cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give the children the sense that reading and paying attention to 
words is exciting and necessary. In an adventure story, it's necessary for 
survival," Thurber said. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no correct route through the maze, children cannot make a 
mistake -- another plus, Thurber noted. 
</P>
<P>
To design the unique labyrinth, Thurber recruited local artist Phil Matzigkeit, 
architect and designer Kotaro Nakamura and writer Bart Thurber, who is her 
husband and an English professor at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The team spent hours brainstorming, deciding how the story should fit with the 
childlike artwork painted by Matzigkeit, a muralist. Then, Nakamura devised a 
way to mount the panels to give children more options in creating their 
adventure story. 
</P>
<P>
While writing his often-funny, tongue-in-cheek script for the maze, Bart 
Thurber used a computer program that allowed him to write the story in separate 
vignettes. 
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the computer mixed the 24 episodes Thurber devised, creating 
myriad options for students to follow through the maze. 
</P>
<P>
The project, the museum's most ambitious in its six-year history, also drew the 
interest of the San Diego County Edition of the Los Angeles Times, which 
donated $45,500 to build the maze. 
</P>
<P>
"This project is a joyful expression of two of The Times' favorite causes: kids 
and literacy. It's also an expression of two of the museum's favorites: 
learning and fun," said Phyllis K. Pfeiffer, the edition's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The maze is designed for children who can read, up to age 12. Younger children 
can enjoy the maze by walking through and looking at the pictures. Or an adult 
can accompany them and read the story aloud. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Museum is inside the La Jolla Village Square shopping center. 
Cost is $2.75 a person, $1.25 for senior citizens. Children under 2 are free.

BUSH DEFENDS STANCE IN FAILED PANAMA COUP 
</P>

<P>
President Bush on Friday firmly defended his Administration's action during the 
failed coup in Panama, saying that he would do nothing differently, but leading 
Senate Democrats blamed him personally for a confused and erratic U.S. 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"This Administration has good people, but policy guidance has to start with the 
President," said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who 
charged that the Administration was caught without any plan of action. 
"Occasionally, we ought to foresee that our policy of encouraging a coup might 
succeed, and we ought to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials acknowledged that Tuesday's coup attempt -- Bush's 
first foreign crisis -- has exposed "organizational problems" in the way the 
White House handles such emergencies. As late as Friday, for example, senior 
officials could not agree on what orders had been given to U.S. troops in 
Panama. And as the confusion continued, senior officials began blaming each 
other for lapses. 
</P>
<P>
And while attention appeared to center on those institutional failures, the 
week's events also have called attention to a sharp division within official 
Washington about how to handle Panama and its controversial leader, Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega. Many lawmakers assert that the President should be prepared to move 
aggressively against the Panamanian strongman, but Administration officials 
appear increasingly to favor a policy of restraint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Not Change Decision 
</P>
<P>
Even in retrospect, Bush insisted that he would not change his decision against 
using U.S. troops to ensure the coup's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything now that would have made me make a different decision," 
he told reporters after emerging from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he 
underwent an operation to remove a cyst from his finger. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren (D-Okla.) said 
the President had an obligation to issue detailed instructions to U.S. 
personnel in Panama telling them what to do in the event of a coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that U.S. officials should have been instructed to ask the 
rebels in advance of their attempted revolt whether they intended to recognize 
a duly elected government, which Noriega has refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebels had been asked that question and if they had promised to install 
an elected government, Nunn said, the United States would then have had the 
"moral basis" on which to use military force to support the coup. "There are 
certainly circumstances under which American troops can be used," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, sentiment seems to have grown for strong U.S. actions to 
remove Noriega -- perhaps even extending to the direct use of U.S. troops. But 
within the Administration, this week's failure has accelerated a move in the 
other direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emphasized Caution 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, for example, emphasized caution in 
their comments. 
</P>
<P>
"What people -- some people -- seem to have wanted me to do is to unleash the 
full military to go in and, quote, 'get Noriega,' " said Bush. "I suppose you 
could have gone to general quarters, but that's not prudent and that's not the 
way I plan to conduct the military or foreign affairs of this country." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, Cheney noted that "we could -- if the President gave me the 
order tonight -- we could have Noriega out of there, probably by midnight. But 
one of the questions you have to ask yourself is how many dead Americans is 
Gen. Noriega worth, and under what circumstances are you prepared to use that 
kind of force?" 
</P>
<P>
His tone, a senior Administration aide said, reflected a conscious decision to 
try to move public attention away from a foreign policy area that has become a 
frustrating embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Administration that knows what it's doing tries to downplay things that 
don't go well," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject of Recriminations 
</P>
<P>
Within the Administration, Panama has rapidly become a subject of 
recriminations, several officials said. A senior Pentagon official identified 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu as the source of a number of comments 
critical of the Pentagon's handling of the crisis. Another Administration 
official confirmed that Sununu had spread word that he was dissatisfied with 
how the National Security Council had responded to the events. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney defended his department's actions. "The only thing I can suggest is 
that, as is true a lot of places, not all the Monday-morning quarterbacks 
reside on Capitol Hill," he said when asked about criticism from Administration 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of who bears the blame, reconstructions of Tuesday's events make 
clear that at key points, the Administration's response was confused. It was 
not at all clear, however, that a more coherent response would have led to a 
different outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"The full story isn't in yet; they're still trying to sort it out," said one 
Administration official. But, he added, "there was no clear line of authority 
that would lead to a Presidential decision" on how to handle the coup. "There 
were a lot of people providing information, and periodically the President was 
informed. There was no clear opportunity for the President to say, 'OK, let's 
go get him' or 'Let's stay out of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"We may have done the right thing," the official concluded, "but we stumbled 
into it." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and Boren criticized Administration policy-makers, both in Panama and at 
the White House, for failing to consult with officials in the CIA as the coup 
unfolded. As a result, they said, decisions were made without adequate 
information. 
</P>
<P>
According to Boren, no one from the CIA was invited to attend either of the two 
important decision-making meetings Tuesday between the President and his aides 
in the White House situation room. It is highly unusual for the CIA to be 
excluded from such meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the clearest examples of the confusion involved the movements of U.S. 
troops to block two key roads that pro-Noriega soldiers were expected to use to 
go to the general's rescue. The troop movements had been requested by the 
leader of the coup, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, in a meeting with U.S. officials 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Even Friday, three days after the failed coup, U.S. officials could not agree 
what orders those troops had been given. Asked if the troops were authorized to 
block Noriega's soldiers if they attempted to move, White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater replied yes. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney, asked the same question, said no. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of decision that would have come up the chain rapidly to the 
President, and he would have been given the opportunity to make the broad 
policy decision -- 'Yes, we want to intervene militarily.' That decision was 
never made," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Noriega's supporters made the question moot by taking a third road. 
But once that happened, U.S. officials apparently failed to tell either the 
rebels or Bush. 
</P>
<P>
According to Boren, who was briefed extensively by the CIA, Cheney and Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, White House officials 
apparently chose not to interrupt Bush's meeting with Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari to ask the President whether American soldiers should be 
stationed on that third road. The coup might have succeeded if the President 
had decided to block the road that the Noriega forces were using, Boren 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is why did we let the coup fail," Boren said. "The President 
should have been given a 'yes' or 'no' option on whether to block that road." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cable Supports Assertion 
</P>
<P>
Both Boren and Nunn said they currently accept Cheney's assertion that the 
rebels refused to turn Noriega over to U.S. officials. They said that account 
is supported by a cable from U.S. military officials in Panama to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Boren said they also have seen another cable sent to Washington by U.S. 
intelligence officials in Panama saying that members of the coup wanted U.S. 
personnel to take Noriega while he was still in rebel custody. Cheney told the 
senators that this second cable was based on a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by his aides to decide whether U.S. troops should take custody of 
Noriega, according to Boren, the President replied "only if he's delivered onto 
American territory."

SCREEN LEGEND BETTE DAVIS DIES IN PARIS HOSPITAL AT 81

<P>
Bette Davis, the two-time Oscar winner whose toughness, huge eyes and haughty, 
cigarette-smoking style made her a movie industry legend, has died at 81, her 
longtime lawyer said early today. 
</P>
<P>
Davis died late Friday in a Paris hospital after returning there from the San 
Sebastian film festival in Spain, said lawyer Harold Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
Davis appeared in more than 80 films, including "Jezebel," "All About Eve," and 
"Of Human Bondage." 
</P>
<P>
She was nominated for Academy Awards 10 times and won an Emmy in 1979 for the 
television production "Strangers -- The Story of a Mother and Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
She won her Oscars for "Dangerous" in 1935 and "Jezebel" in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Her screen heroines were often strong women -- as uncompromising as the actress 
was off-screen. 
</P>
<P>
She once suggested the lines for her own epitaph: "Bette Davis -- She Did It 
the Hard Way." That included a 1985 comeback after suffering from cancer, a 
stroke and a broken hip in quick succession. 
</P>
<P>
Her success story was one of Hollywood's most unlikely tales. Lacking the looks 
of a traditional Hollywood glamour girl, the skinny youngster with the huge 
eyes relied on her acting skill and took roles nobody else wanted, playing 
nasty women more often than nice ones. 
</P>
<P>
"My entire career was never based on looks or glamour or sex," she once said. 
"It was an absolute miracle that people came to watch me act." 
</P>
<P>
She sought happiness in marriage, but after four husbands declared that she had 
failed and would never marry again. When she wrote her autobiography, she 
titled it, "The Lonely Life." 
</P>
<P>
She was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis on April 5, 1908 in Lowell, Mass., the elder 
of two daughters of Harlow and Ruth Favor Davis. Her parents were descended 
from early New England settlers -- Pilgrims and Huguenots -- and Davis was 
always proud of her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' parents separated when she was 7, and through her childhood she lived 
alternately with her mother and in boarding schools. As a teen-ager she showed 
talent in school theatrics and decided to become an actress. 
</P>
<P>
She won a scholarship to study with drama coach John Murray Anderson, ushered 
at New England theaters in the summer and won small roles in stock company 
shows before making her New York stage debut in "The Earth Between" in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
During her first Broadway hit, "Broken Dishes," Davis was given a screen test 
by movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn. Unimpressed, he scolded a talent scout for 
wasting his time. 
</P>
<P>
However, her stage reviews caught the attention of Universal Pictures, which 
offered a three-month contract and brought her to California in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
Her film debut came the next year in "Bad Sister." Five other pictures 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
When the studio dropped her contract, Warner Bros. picked it up and in 1932 
gave her a co-starring role as an ingenue in "The Man Who Played God." 
</P>
<P>
It was the beginning of her 18-year association with Warner's, a sometimes 
stormy period in which Davis was known for her famous quarrels with studio 
chief Jack Warner. Yet when Warner was asked in later years to define the term 
"movie star," he said simply, "Bette Davis." 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, Davis was loaned to RKO for the role that would establish her 
reputation -- the sullen heroine Mildred in "Of Human Bondage."

TIES TO SUNUNU HELP BLOCK NOMINATIONS;

<P>
CONSERVATIVES WIELDING INFLUENCE IN WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The conservative lobby, often at loggerheads with President Bush in the past, 
today enjoys easy access to the White House, likes the Administration's 
positions on most domestic issues and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability 
to veto presidential nominations it finds objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in quietly preventing the nomination of former Rep. M. Caldwell Butler 
(R-Va.) to head the Legal Services Corp., militant conservatives demonstrated 
that they could block the appointment of even a popular conservative with a 
long record of supporting Bush because they did not like his views on a single 
issue -- abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the conservative lobby's influence is its close links with White 
House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. The former New Hampshire governor, in 
addition to consulting with conservatives on presidential appointments, has 
been readily accessible for consultations on legislation and has arranged for 
several meetings with Bush at the White House, according to David A. Keene, 
chairman of the American Conservative Union, and other conservative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"There've been about a half dozen meetings," said Keene, who called Sununu the 
conservatives' "primary champion in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
"Sununu has been terrific. He has handled himself better than any chief of 
staff I've seen in the 23 years I've been in the White House, and I've known 
them all," said Paul M. Weyrich, chairman of Coalitions for America. "I don't 
always get the answer I want, but he's extremely accessible." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Butler, who was to have been nominated as chairman of the 
11-member board of the Legal Services Corp., which Congress created to provide 
legal help for the poor, Sununu decided at the last minute that he should 
undergo an interrogation session with conservative activists. When they 
objected to Butler's answers on abortion-related issues, the conservatives 
persuaded the White House to back away from the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe they were that powerful," said Butler, who has known 
Bush since serving in the House during 1973-83. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Nominations Blocked 
</P>
<P>
The Butler case is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, conservative activists had blocked several other nominations, 
including those of Robert B. Fiske Jr., a prominent New York lawyer, to be the 
No. 2 Justice Department official; Drew E. Altman, New Jersey human services 
commissioner, to head the Medicare and Medicaid program of Health and Human 
Services; and Robert Fulton, Oklahoma's cabinet secretary of social services, 
to head the HHS welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those cases, "there have been lots of others that haven't been 
so public," said Weyrich, who would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, several leaders of the conservative movement, reflecting on the 
scuttling of Butler's nomination, said that, in some ways, they have more clout 
with Bush than they did with President Ronald Reagan despite the fact that they 
have been much closer politically and ideologically to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"Except in the area of public policy, we have at least as much, if not more, 
impact on the Bush Administration than we had on the Reagan Administration," 
Weyrich said. "The Bush Administration has a reputation for being more 
pragmatic, and, in a way, that's actually helpful. You explain an issue that 
would impact on them and they take it seriously and listen to you. That's 
unlike the Reagan Administration, which did everything they did because of the 
image it would project on the 6 o'clock news." 
</P>
<P>
Even in the area of public policy, conservative leaders have been in agreement 
with most of Bush's domestic programs. They generally support his tax policies 
(no new taxes and a reduction in capital gains taxes), his enforcement-oriented 
drug program and his strong stands opposing gun controls and favoring a 
constitutional amendment prohibiting desecration of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Only on foreign policy has the conservative lobby marked out substantial 
differences with Bush. Even there, in most instances they have not been overly 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
Militant conservatives fault Bush for not moving forcefully to oust Panamanian 
leader Manuel A. Noriega and for not being more supportive of the Nicaragua 
rebels. They are unhappy with the Administration's scaled-back support for 
"Star Wars." And they think Bush has been too supportive of Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform programs, but they were even more critical of 
Reagan on that point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact on Appointments 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, at least, the conservatives' biggest impact with the Bush 
Administration has been on presidential appointments. 
</P>
<P>
In an article written for the Washington Post, Fulton said that he, Fiske and 
Altman were victims of aggressive lobbying by the "hard right-wing" and a White 
House personnel appointment process that is "potentially poisoning relations 
with the mainstream of the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
Fulton, who describes himself as having "a solid Republican background" with 
more than 33 years' experience in federal and state government, wrote that 
"Sununu, himself far to the right of the Republican mainstream, has created a 
substantial network of right-wing 'transition' staff and other insiders whose 
lifeblood is politics rather than government. Having little appreciation of the 
difficult challenge of running government, they believe appointments should 
provide political rewards and always be made with an eye to the next election." 
</P>
<P>
The Butler case is a prime example of how the conservative leaders' ties to 
Sununu can give them veto power even when the candidate for nomination is 
eminently qualified, has strong conservative credentials and has substantial 
congressional support. A letter signed by 32 members of a conservative bloc in 
the House, including Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), endorsed the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who supported legislation that created the Legal Services Corp. in 1974 
during the Richard M. Nixon Administration and helped it survive an attack by 
conservative activists in 1981 in the first year of the Reagan Administration, 
did not seek out the nomination. He was asked by Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) to 
be a candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
McCollum said he thought Butler was highly qualified for the post but that 
several conservative activists "who were historically unhappy with him when he 
was in Congress had doubts about him. So I reported that to Sununu, and he 
wanted to make everybody as happy as he could, so he said there should be a 
meeting to dispel their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"Sununu was not willing to proceed without having that meeting. He wanted all 
the bases covered," McCollum said. "And it seemed the logical thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met With Coalition 
</P>
<P>
At McCollum's request, Butler traveled to Washington from his home in Roanoke, 
Va., to meet with the National Legal Services Reform Coalition, a group formed 
by conservative leaders who, having been unsuccessful in trying to abolish the 
agency, have been lobbying to control its board and therefor its operations. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 persons attended the session, including Weyrich, Keene and Howard J. 
Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus. Phillips is such a hard-line 
conservative and still so strongly favors abolishing the Legal Services Corp. 
that he has not joined the reform coalition. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to their questions, Butler said he thought a pregnant woman would be 
entitled to receive advice on her legal rights to an abortion from a Legal 
Services attorney, a view they declared was "totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
They also found unacceptable his statement that Legal Services could sue a 
hospital that refused to provide a Medicaid-financed abortion to a poor person, 
a view they insisted conflicts with a provision of the Legal Services law that 
bars most abortion legal action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Had Abandoned Me' 
</P>
<P>
The White House, said Butler, subsequently "notified me that the nomination was 
politically undoable, which is a euphemism for saying they had abandoned me." 
White House officials confirmed his account. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, a widely respected attorney and former five-term congressman, said he 
was "offended" by the way he had been rejected and by the obvious power the 
conservative lobby enjoys at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"I really shouldn't have gone to that meeting," said Butler, who found 
Phillips' questioning particularly "hostile." 
</P>
<P>
"What really upset me was they seemed to be looking for a chink in my armor to 
exploit," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who has been so sharply critical of Bush in the past that the 
President refuses to meet with him even though he has met with the other 
conservative leaders, said he opposed Butler because he would use "taxpayer 
funds to advance the pro-abortion cause." 
</P>
<P>
Keene said that "Butler's a gentleman, and a lot of us liked him personally" 
and that during the questioning of him Butler "sympathized with many of the 
concerns we expressed about the way the program is operated. But he made it 
fairly clear that, as chairman, he wouldn't see it as his business to do much 
about it, that Congress should address it." 
</P>
<P>
And it "created outrage" among some members, Keene said, when Butler expressed 
his views on Legal Services and abortion matters. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), a champion of the Legal Services Corp. 
who supported the nomination, said he told Sununu, a friend and former New 
Hampshire governor, he thought it was "bad form to drop the nomination in light 
of all the support Butler had."

HERAT, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 24,000 feet, Ariana Airlines Flight 455 to Herat was somewhere over 
Afghanistan's war-torn Bamiyan province last week when Ariana employee 
Bismillah very casually mentioned the enemy anti-aircraft base located directly 
below. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, he told his first American passenger in years, U.S.-backed 
moujahedeen rebels fired an American-supplied Stinger missile at his civilian 
airliner. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to worry," the cheery Bismillah shouted over the drone of the Soviet-made 
Antonov-26 turboprop. "It missed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crash in Iran 
</P>
<P>
But one anecdote led to another, and Bismillah, who works as a flight 
dispatcher, quickly moved on to the story of a hijacking in August: 
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot of another Ariana domestic flight, it seems, pulled a gun on his 
best friend, the pilot, and tried to force him to land in neighboring Iran, 
where the co-pilot planned to defect to the Muslim rebels. A gun battle ensued 
in the cockpit, and the plane crashed in Iran, killing six. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's why, you see, Ariana Airlines is now down to just five domestic 
aircraft," Bismillah lamented with a sigh. "You see what it is like trying to 
run an airline during this war? You see what this war has done to all of us?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after a decade of war, the Afghan government's domestic airline, 
complete with its battered planes, neurotic air crews and nonexistent 
schedules, is a typical example of President Najibullah's effort to maintain a 
semblance of government in a nation of ruins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destroyed on Ground 
</P>
<P>
Despite rebel anti-aircraft emplacements, rocket attacks that have destroyed 
planes on runways and a budget that allows wages of just $14 a month to 
employees such as Bismillah, who risk their lives daily, Najibullah has 
insisted that Ariana's domestic show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
The handful of European and East Bloc diplomatic observers who remain in Kabul, 
the capital, say such issues are key symbols of survival for Najibullah's 
beleaguered, pro-Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
The regime has steadfastly defied Western predictions that it would fall within 
weeks of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan last February. The troops 
had been supporting the Afghan government against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a Times reporter learned firsthand during a recent visit to 
Afghanistan, there are prices to pay for such symbolic shows of strength. In 
the case of Ariana Airlines, the exercise clearly has produced the strangest 
commercial airline on earth. 
</P>
<P>
Ariana's passengers, for example, never have to worry about the airline losing 
their check-in baggage. They sit on it during the flight. There is no "Fasten 
Seat Belt" sign -- because there are no seat belts. As for "No Smoking" 
sections, forget it. The ground-maintenance crews puff away on Russian 
cigarettes even while they refill the wing tanks. 
</P>
<P>
And Ariana Flight 455 from Kabul to the extreme western city of Herat was 
typical. 
</P>
<P>
It began in a bombed-out storage shed that Ariana calls its domestic departure 
lounge in Kabul. None of the employees on hand had the faintest idea what time 
the plane would depart. They didn't know whether Flight 455 would stop 
somewhere en route to Herat. In fact, they weren't even all that sure there 
would even be a Flight 455 that day. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we make schedules?" a grim-faced Bismillah later said. "We never 
really know exactly where our planes are going to land even after they take 
off." 
</P>
<P>
With boarding passes -- tiny, blank pieces of cardboard -- in hand, passengers 
were then led to a battered bus outside the shed. The bus windows were sealed 
shut, but air circulated well through the dozens of shrapnel holes torn into 
the bus's sides from the weekly rebel rocket attacks on Kabul's only airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stand Up During Takeoff 
</P>
<P>
Soon, it was announced that Flight 455 would indeed depart, and the plane was 
quickly packed solid with sacks and bags and passengers, some of them forced to 
stand even during takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Space on Ariana's few daily flights is coveted, to say the least. After 10 
years of war, most of Afghanistan's roads are largely impassable. What Soviet 
aerial bombardments haven't destroyed, rebel artillery attacks have. Then, 
there are the added travel risks of kidnaping and robbery by armed bandits and 
tribal fighters from both warring sides along the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
But there were other glimpses of the war on board the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The vast array of baggage, for example, underscored the strangeness and the 
brutality of Afghanistan's unending conflict. It ranged from giant tambourines 
and peacock feathers to artificial limbs and a coffin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extreme Isolation 
</P>
<P>
And the extreme isolation of Afghanistan -- 10 years after Najibullah's ruling 
party appealed to their Soviet backers and received 115,000 Red Army troops -- 
also was obvious during a brief conversation on board between a Westerner and a 
young Afghan engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you from?" the wide-eyed engineer asked after hearing the Westerner 
speak to a colleague in English. 
</P>
<P>
"America," came the reply. 
</P>
<P>
"My God," the engineer shrieked. "I am so happy. You are the first Americans I 
have seen in 10 years. When I was in Kabul University in 1978, all of my 
teachers were Americans. I remember Miss Cooper from Texas. There was another 
one from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"But, why are you on this plane? Why are you going to Herat? There is nothing 
in Herat but more war." 
</P>
<P>
The war also was discussed in the cockpit, where, as is standard practice, the 
pilot was an air force colonel and the co-pilot a civilian, a precaution 
against hijacking and defection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ill-Fated Flight 
</P>
<P>
The practice almost worked two months ago on the ill-fated Ariana domestic 
flight to Zaranj, in the extreme southwestern corner of Afghanistan a few miles 
from the Iranian border. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the flight, the defecting co-pilot, whom several sources said was 
the son of Afghanistan's former prime minister Hassan Sharq, tried to persuade 
the pilot to join him. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after the co-pilot pulled a gun, forcibly took control of the plane 
and crossed the Iranian border that the pilot fought back, grabbing the pistol 
and wounding the co-pilot. But it was too late to return to Afghanistan, and 
the plane crash-landed in Iranian territory, where all the survivors, and the 
wreckage, remain to this day. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine," Bismillah mused, as Flight 455 slowly crossed over the desolate, 
lunar Afghan countryside, "our own co-pilot hijacking the plane. You see what 
it has come to here, what happens when brother fights brother and best friend 
fights best friend. Where it will go, only God knows." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbol of Hope 
</P>
<P>
But Bismillah is one of Afghanistan's many symbols of hope. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Ariana employees, the flight dispatcher also accompanies 
international Ariana flights to Frankfurt, West Germany; Dubai, in the Persian 
Gulf; Prague, Czechoslovakia, and New Delhi. He has had many chances to defect 
or simply walk away. And he has had many good reasons to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by American advisers decades ago, the 28-year veteran Ariana employee 
would make 100 times his salary outside Afghanistan. During his night stops in 
foreign countries, Ariana gives him less than $20 a day for hotel, meals and 
taxis. And, as he noted, "in most countries, people don't try to shoot down 
your airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resists Temptation 
</P>
<P>
But Bismillah has resisted temptation. In fact, he has forbidden all eight of 
his children to join the 5 million refugees who have fled Afghanistan. And, 
Bismillah said, none of the reasons for his resoluteness are political. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like politics. . . ," he said, adding, "In the last 10 years, I have 
seen for the first time with my own eyes the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, 
Romania, Germany, India and Dubai. So many places. And, in any one of those 
countries, I could make so much more money. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do not go. Those places are not my home. And it is better to stay in 
your own country. Everyone must do what little they can to keep our country 
alive. Yes, that is much better." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Antonov-26 lurched downward. Bismillah glanced around sharply to 
make sure it hadn't been hit. It hadn't; it had simply encountered an air 
pocket.

POPE LEAVES FOR 10-DAY TRIP TO ASIA AS RIGHTS GROUP URGES HIM TO SPEAK OUT

Pope John Paul II on Friday departed on a politically sensitive, 10-day Asian 
pilgrimage amid calls that he speak out on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's special Alitalia Boeing 747 took off from Leonardo da Vinci Airport 
at 2:15 p.m. He was to arrive in Seoul, South Korea, today after a flight of 
more than 13 hours. His route will take him over the Soviet Union; China 
earlier denied permission for the overflight. 
</P>
<P>
It is the 44th foreign trip of John Paul's 11-year papacy. 
</P>
<P>
He is officially going to Seoul to preside at closing ceremonies for the 44th 
International Eucharistic Congress, which has included discussions about an 
eventual reunification of North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The climax of the congress will be an outdoor Mass on the capital's Youido 
Plaza -- a gigantic open space built to serve as an air strip in time of war. 
</P>
<P>
Before the pontiff departed, Asia Watch, an independent human rights 
organization, urged him to speak out on human rights issues in South Korea and 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
"Your strong expression of concern on human rights would have an immeasurable 
impact in furthering respect for human rights in those countries," the group 
said in a letter to the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Three dissident priests are currently in jail in South Korea: one who went to 
Communist North Korea this summer to accompany home a student radical and two 
others who helped set up his trip. South Korea opposes most contacts with its 
northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
During his 48-hour stay in Seoul, the Pope is to have private talks with 
President Roh Tae Woo. On Monday, the pontiff will fly to predominantly Muslim 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
He is due to spend a day on East Timor, an island with a majority Roman 
Catholic population that Indonesia annexed in 1976 after Portugal withdrew. 
Neither the United Nations nor the Vatican recognizes Indonesia's rule. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists in Indonesia have asked the Pope to persuade their 
nation to stop executions and arbitrary arrests in East Timor. Indonesia has 
denied there are widespread human rights violations.

MARCOS' DEATH ELICITS BIZARRE DOINGS, RUMORS

<P>
In a nation that thrives on intrigue, Ferdinand E. Marcos' death may outdo his 
life for inspiring the bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week, a 90-foot-high stone bust of Marcos was reportedly seen 
weeping. A huge black butterfly fluttered about in his old palace haunts. A 
plot was uncovered that involved deadly "mercury-tipped bullets" and a 
booby-trapped briefcase. And Marcos' body may be secretly shipped home 
disguised as cargo. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the lurid tales that have dominated front pages here in the 
eight days since the ousted Philippine president died in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unique Drama 
</P>
<P>
Behind it all, a uniquely Philippine drama is being played out as the nation 
struggles with the political and cultural legacy of a leader who became an 
international symbol of greed and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is where -- and when -- Marcos' remains will be buried. At stake, by 
her own account, is the still-struggling government of President Corazon 
Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
The drama began when Aquino barred Marcos' burial in the Philippines only hours 
after he died. Even his corpse, warned the woman who took office in 1986 after 
helping to topple Marcos, has a "malignant power" that opponents on the left or 
right could use to seize power. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Aquino's ban grew when it developed that Marcos loyalists, who had 
vowed to mobilize 5 million people, could turn out barely enough people for 
candle-light vigils. Even longtime Aquino supporters argued that it was wrong 
to deny a man burial in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"Let Marcos come home!" cried an editorial in the Daily Globe, whose publisher 
is a former Aquino speech writer and adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Murder Plot Alleged 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Aquino tried to strengthen her warning about subversion. After she 
called a classified security briefing, a Cabinet secretary reportedly leaked 
details of a purported assassination plot masterminded by a former Marcos crony 
hiding in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The plot, according to the Manila Chronicle, included "mercury-tipped bullets 
which could kill a person with a mere graze on the skin" and an attache case 
with a gun hidden inside "so the assassin could walk away unnoticed" after 
aiming the gun and setting a timer. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos followers have been linked to at least three attempted coups since 1986, 
so threats are taken seriously here. But this alleged plot, Aquino aides later 
admitted, dated at least to last February and was not related to Marcos' death. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Marcos' lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the 
burial ban, saying the cadaver poses no risk to national security. The 
government prosecutor responded that a corpse has "no rights." Either way, 
Aquino announced, she will abide by the court's decision." 
</P>
<P>
"She knows (the burial battle) has polarized the country," Dee Dee Siytangco, a 
spokesman at Malacanang Palace, said Friday. "That's why she said leave it to 
the Supreme Court. She wants to get on with the business of running the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
But the court may take weeks to decide. And after on-again-off-again burial 
announcements, the Marcos family apparently has decided not to bury the body 
even temporarily in Hawaii until after the court rules. 
</P>
<P>
So, what the newspapers have dubbed the "battle of the widows" has commenced. 
In Honolulu, Marcos' widow, Imelda, has fired round after bitter round at 
Aquino in daily interviews with Manila radio and TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the real president," Imelda Marcos said angrily in one interview, 
standing over her husband's corpse. "She is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Conditions 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Supreme Court allows Marcos' body to be returned, Imelda Marcos 
could not accompany it unless the U.S. Justice Department agrees. That is not 
likely; she faces trial in New York next March 14 on federal racketeering 
charges involving nearly $200 million in Manhattan real estate and art, and the 
two countries have no extradition treaty. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Ferdinand (Bong Bong) Marcos Jr. could come home from Honolulu. 
Long regarded as a political and intellectual lightweight, Marcos' 31-year-old 
son now parts his hair like his father, and this week he announced he is 
anxious to "fill my father's shoes." 
</P>
<P>
He has "emerged as the new standard-bearer and bright hope of the fallen Marcos 
empire," a front-page newspaper story said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. "My loyalty is not inheritable," Rafael Recto, Marcos' 
longtime lawyer in the Philippines, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems for Aquino 
</P>
<P>
Although support for Marcos has fallen steadily since he fled the country, his 
death has not helped Aquino. She has faced mounting criticism in recent months 
for alleged corruption in government, stalled land reform, an increasingly 
active Communist insurgency, and a divisive debate over the future of U.S. 
military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, Aquino acknowledged this week that she cannot forget her 
bitter feelings. After all, President Marcos jailed her husband, Benigno 
(Ninoy) Aquino Jr., under martial law in 1972 and later forced him into exile 
in the United States. Moreover, Marcos was widely blamed for Aquino's 
assassination when he returned to Manila in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the widow of a man who knocked on every door for the right to return to 
his country," the president told a group of judges. "This is a case that I 
understand fully well from both sides."

FUTURE SOVIET DEFENSE CHIEF MAY BE CIVILIAN, YAZOV SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, assessing the pace of changes in the 
Soviet military on the final day of a visit to the United States, speculated 
Friday that Moscow may break with a centuries-old tradition and pick a civilian 
as its next defense chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe a minister of defense must have the proficiency and the 
stamina to drop from a plane with a parachute," said the beribboned Yazov, a 
general in the Soviet Army. "A minister of defense is more of a political 
analyst and a politician." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet officer's comments drew a smile from his host, U.S. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney, a former congressman from Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov said the newly elected Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme 
Soviet, the sitting legislature, may consider changing the policy that dictates 
that the defense minister must be a military man, a tradition he said dates 
"from the years of the old Russia, the Russia of Kiev." 
</P>
<P>
The first Soviet defense minister to visit the United States, Yazov wound up 
his six-day tour by inviting Cheney to the Soviet Union, an offer Cheney 
accepted. Defense officials said that visit is likely to take place next year. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov's comments revealed a Soviet military struggling under President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or restructuring, which he stressed "was 
not contrived to bring about the renewal of the military" in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika was intended to bring about a renewal of the relations in the 
Soviet society as a whole," said Yazov. "Naturally, to a certain extent the 
renewal processes have touched upon the ways of the military and our armed 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old general said that in one recent instance, a military cadet 
challenged a general officer in an election to the Congress of Peoples' 
Deputies -- and won. In another, he recounted, lieutenant colonels voted 
against a proposal of the minister of defense in the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
"So these are the rights being enjoyed by all the citizens of our society. So 
to a certain extent, the perestroika processes have already been practiced in 
the armed forces of the U.S.S.R.," Yazov said. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov was the first candidate for his position to face the scrutiny -- and 
scathing criticism -- of Soviet legislators before he was narrowly approved 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Troops Praised 
</P>
<P>
Yazov praised the U.S. troops he met and watched in a series of maneuvers at 
bases across the country. "The power they showed struck us immensely," he said 
of the Army's elite 82nd Airborne paratroopers, who conducted a jump for Yazov 
at Ft. Bragg, N.C., Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging session with reporters, Yazov launched a peace offensive of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you a question," Yazov challenged one questioner through an 
interpreter. "Are you serious about believing that the Soviet Union is 
preparing to go to war with the United States? 
</P>
<P>
"It is the atmosphere of trust that should be put in the foreground," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Yazov turned prickly when he was asked to assess the American B-2 stealth 
bomber, an aircraft designed to breach Soviet airspace unobserved and deliver 
nuclear weapons on sensitive Soviet targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider it to be a challenge on the part of the United States in 
regard to the Soviet Union. You keep perfecting your military hardware, we also 
keep perfecting our military weapons systems," Yazov said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to modify the Soviet air defense system" in response to the 
plane, which is now being tested by the Air Force, Yazov said. "The Soviet air 
defenses have the capability today to bring down any air threat," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov replaced Sergei L. Sokolov last July after an embarrassing incident in 
which a 19-year-old West German pilot flew into Soviet airspace unchallenged 
and landed in Red Square.

Norway's minority Labor government will officially step down on Oct. 13, Prime 
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be replaced by three center-right parties that earlier this week formed 
a coalition, prompted by Labor's dismal performance in national elections last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Arne Strand said Brundtland would probably stay in charge over 
the weekend until Oct. 16 when Conservative leader Jan Syse takes over as prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland's minority government has ruled this country of 4 million people, 
with its oil-based economy and extensive welfare state, since 1986.

TWO SWISS RED CROSS WORKERS ABDUCTED IN S. LEBANON

Masked gunmen kidnaped two Swiss Red Cross workers at a medical center outside 
the Lebanese port city of Sidon on Friday, the latest in a series of abductions 
of foreign relief personnel in Lebanon's lawless south. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, identified as Emmanuel Christen, 25, and Elio Erriquez, 23, were 
bundled into the trunk of the kidnapers' car and driven off in the direction of 
Ein el Hilwa, a large Palestinian refugee camp, according to press reports from 
Sidon. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian camp lies less than 100 yards from the Red Cross center, where 
Christen and Erriquez were assigned as technicians fitting artificial limbs to 
Lebanese war victims. One report quoted a policeman as saying the gunmen's car 
and a backup vehicle entered the camp. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the abduction, the third 
similar case in less than a year in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the International Committee of the Red Cross withdrew its staff 
members from Lebanon after the kidnaping of Peter Winkler, a Sidon-based 
official of the organization. He was released a month later and Swiss 
authorities sent their representatives back in January after reportedly 
receiving assurances from armed groups that there would be no further 
kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in May, gunmen abducted two West German men working for the Humanitas 
relief organization in Sidon. The Germans, Heinrich Struebig and Thomas 
Kempner, are still missing and believed to be among 16 foreign hostages still 
held in Lebanon, including eight Americans. Most of the foreign hostages were 
kidnaped in West Beirut, 25 miles north of Sidon, by pro-Iranian elements. On 
July 31, one of the radical Islamic cells, the Organization of Oppressed on 
Earth, reported that it had killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, one of 
the American hostages, and released a videotape of his body, hanging from a 
gallows. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler's kidnapers reportedly had threatened to abduct other Swiss workers 
after his release, alleging that the Red Cross and Swiss authorities had 
reneged on a promised ransom payment. 
</P>
<P>
Press reports from Sidon said that Friday's kidnapers were waiting in two cars 
outside the medical center when Christen and Erriquez drove up to begin work. 
"Christen parked the car at the center's parking lot and climbed out, holding 
an artificial limb," a Lebanese policeman was quoted as saying. When two gunmen 
jumped from one of the cars and trained their weapons on the medical aides, he 
said, "Christen and Erriquez immediately threw their arms up, offering no 
resistance. They were bundled at gunpoint into the trunk of the (car), which 
sped off followed by the other car, loaded with armed guards." 
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Saad, head of the Popular Liberation Army, a Lebanese militia that 
effectively controls Sidon, denied any responsibility in the kidnaping in a 
meeting with reporters. "This is an Ein el Hilwa affair, not mine," he was 
quoted as saying, implicating radical Palestinian groups active in the refugee 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the camp is the Palestinian shantytown of Miye ou Miye, where forces of 
the terrorist kingpin Abu Nidal reportedly have a base. His breakaway 
Palestinian group, Fatah-Revolutionary Council, was implicated in the Winkler 
kidnaping but has denied it played a role. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those who carry out such actions do it as a blackmail (for ransom) 
rather than for any political or national stand," Saad, the Nasserite leader, 
told reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Bauverd, a spokesman for the Geneva-based International Committee of the 
Red Cross, said the kidnaping of Christen and Erriquez would deter the 
humanitarian work of his agencies that work in Lebanon.

U.N. CONDEMNS ALLEGED ISRAELI RIGHTS ABUSES

The General Assembly voted 140-2 Friday for an Arab resolution condemning 
Israel for alleged violation of human rights in the territories it occupies and 
demanding that Israel abide by Geneva Convention rules protecting civilians in 
wartime. 
</P>
<P>
Only the United States joined Israel in voting against the resolution. Zaire 
and five Latin American states abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein was the sole speaker in opposition after Libyan 
Ambassador Ali Treiki presented the Arab proposal with the charge that the 
Palestinian people had offered the olive branch of peace only to be met with 
"napalm and the engines of death." 
</P>
<P>
Bein rebuked the Arab states, with the exception of Egypt, for their refusal 
even to respond to an invitation to negotiate issued by Israeli Foreign 
Minister Moshe Arens before the assembly last week. 
</P>
<P>
While Egypt and Israel are seeking a Mideast peace, Bein said, the other Arab 
states are waging "political warfare against Israel and against the peace 
initiative of its government." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Alexander F. Watson, speaking after the vote, emphasized U.S. 
support for the Arab contention that civilians in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza strip are protected by the Geneva Convention, a position rejected by 
Israel on grounds that the territories are not occupied but "administered" by 
Israel alone.

LEBANON'S LONG CIVIL WAR HAS ROBBED BEIRUT'S CHILDREN OF THEIR YOUTH

Rima Torbay is 24. She never was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 11 years old when the war began," Torbay explained, recalling the 
fighting that severed Beirut at the outset of the Lebanese conflict in 1975-76. 
"We lived on the demarcation line. There the shooting never stopped, never in 
all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Life on the Green Line, as the informal boundary between the predominantly 
Muslim west side of the city and the Christian east is known, spared no time 
for the awakenings of adolescence among Torbay and her Christian companions. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends died because of this war," she said dryly. "It was not easy to even 
think of fun." 
</P>
<P>
A lithe brunette, Torbay said she never had a boyfriend in her teen-age years, 
never wondered what to do with her summers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pushed to an early maturity." 
</P>
<P>
Torbay channeled her energies into her studies and her commitment to the 
Christian cause. She is studying psychology at a Beirut university and working 
on the headquarters staff of the Lebanese Forces, the Christian militia, which 
she joined when she was 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Under this war situation you get more" -- the French-speaking young woman 
searched for a word in English -- "more force, more spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Her militia office has become a study hall. Often she goes home only to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here 12 hours a day," she said. "It's an extra benefit because we have a 
generator." 
</P>
<P>
At home she usually studies by candlelight. Beirut's power station is producing 
only two hours of electricity a day, and the timing is irregular. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed my last exams under shelling at the campus," Torbay remarked. 
</P>
<P>
A pile of textbooks sits to one side on her desk at the militia headquarters 
where, when time permits, she works on her thesis, the study of a schizophrenic 
child. Beirut itself is an open book for research into the mental health 
effects of war. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of depression, a lot of very nervous people," said Torbay, who 
insisted she has surmounted her fears, though she was chain-smoking and 
repeatedly flipped a lock of brown hair from her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"In the shelling," she said, "you couldn't go outside, you never see the light. 
For me it's become a habit. I don't care about death anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have a friend who has these panic attacks. She begins trembling, and 
then just breaks into tears." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists are just beginning to assess the damage of war, Torbay said, but 
they have no yardstick. There were no prewar studies of depression in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, researchers have found that the children of Beirut "are very 
badly damaged," she told a reporter. In the midst of war, their street game is 
playing soldier. They have become more independent, resisting parental 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents try to help," she observed. "They'll take their children out of 
the shelling, up to the mountains, and explain to them the reasons for the 
fighting so they can understand it realistically." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Torbay's own childhood friends have fled Lebanon for good. She left 
once herself, to school in Paris in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"But I simply couldn't stay there when I read of the shelling in Beirut," she 
said. "I came home." 
</P>
<P>
But not since she was 11, when war descended, has she been to the western half 
of her native city.

SENATE SEEKS DEAL TO DELAY VOTE ON CAPITAL GAINS; 
</P>
<P>
WOULD STRIP TAX CUT FROM DEFICIT-REDUCTION BILL; ACTION COULD AID PASSAGE 
</P>

Senate leaders, apparently boosting chances that Congress will ultimately enact 
a capital gains tax cut, neared agreement Friday night on a plan to delay a 
vote on President Bush's capital gains proposal for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of negotiations, Senate Republicans expressed support for a 
Democratic offer to strip the tax issue from urgent legislation designed to 
trim the budget deficit. Instead, taxes would be considered separately in 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are moving toward an agreement," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) said Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the special rules that apply to debate of the deficit reduction 
bill, 60 senators would have been required to approve a capital gains tax cut 
as a part of that legislation. But, as part of a separate bill, a capital gains 
tax cut would need only a majority of senators voting -- a maximum of 51 if all 
100 were present. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House OK Needed 
</P>
<P>
The chief remaining obstacle to cinching the deal was the support of House 
leaders for a plan for a separate vote on the capital gains measure. Senate and 
House leaders scheduled a meeting for this morning to try to complete a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Bush had expressed opposition to any arrangement that would put 
off a showdown on his capital gains proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital gains is vital," Bush said before meeting to discuss the situation 
with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill. "It's not an extraneous matter with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, in a session that stretched into the early morning hours of 
Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee rejected Bush's capital gains tax cut 
-- already approved by the House -- in favor of a Democratic plan that would 
make individual retirement accounts more appealing for millions of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Tax Breaks 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the committee loaded its bill with dozens of extra tax breaks 
worth billions of dollars to wealthy individuals and specific business 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats, apparently embarrassed by the widespread publicity given to 
the panel's late-night largess and uncertain whether they have the votes to 
defeat Bush's capital gains proposal, argued that the only way to approve a 
deficit-reduction bill quickly was to strip it of its controversial tax 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats charged that Bush's initial insistence on pressing the capital gains 
cut guaranteed that Congress would not complete the deficit reduction bill 
before Oct. 16. That is when automatic spending cuts are supposed to take 
effect if Congress has not pushed the projected deficit below the $110-billion 
target of the Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
"The choice is up to the White House," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.). He said that those who will suffer from the automatic 
cuts include Medicare recipients, farmers and students with college loans. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the government has been operating under the specter of the 
Gramm-Rudman ax since the 1990 fiscal year began last Sunday. But most 
government agencies, expecting Congress to restore funds to compensate for any 
automatic spending cuts, are planning no significant cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The capital gains tax cut became part of the deficit reduction bill because, by 
most estimates, it would actually add to government revenues in its first two 
years. This is because it would encourage the sale of assets that would 
otherwise be held, thus producing tax revenue now. 
</P>
<P>
Under the impending agreement, Republicans apparently will support the 
Democratic plan to rush through a simplified deficit-reduction measure in 
return for a Democratic promise to guarantee a separate vote on cutting the 
capital gains rate, one of Bush's key campaign pledges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the capital gains tax cut lost in the Finance Committee on a 10-10 tie 
vote, Bush appears to have the support of a majority of the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains are profits from the sale of assets. Under current law, they are 
fully taxed at the same rates as other income, up to a maximum of 33%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Slashes Tax Rate 
</P>
<P>
Under a bill passed by the House Thursday, the top rate on most capital gains 
would be cut to 19.6% through the end of 1991. Then the rate would rise to 28%, 
but only gains beyond the inflation rate would be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Finance Committee, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) offered a permanent 
capital gains cut. With the support of the White House, he proposed that the 
capital gains tax rate vary with the length of time the investment was held. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who sold after Oct. 1 would be allowed to exclude 5% of the profit on 
assets owned at least one year, even if the assets were acquired before the new 
law took effect. The exclusion would increase by 5 percentage points for each 
additional year of ownership, up to a maximum savings of 30% on assets held at 
least six years. 
</P>
<P>
Packwood's plan, which was defeated by the 10-10 vote, is expected to be the 
starting point for whatever capital gains plan the Senate considers. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the Senate accepts a capital gains tax cut, its tax and spending 
measures will have to go to a conference committee to settle significant 
differences between the House and Senate versions of the deficit reduction 
legislation.

BUSH 'FINE' AFTER SURGEONS REMOVE CYST FROM FINGER 
</P>

Surgeons cut deeply into the middle finger of President Bush's right hand 
Friday and removed a small cyst in a procedure that White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said was "entirely successful." 
</P>
<P>
The President underwent the minor surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 
Washington and then flew by helicopter to Camp David, Md., for the Columbus Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appears Benign 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Burton Lee III, the White House physician, said although the cyst appeared 
to be benign, a pathological examination of the material removed from the 
finger would be conducted. By definition, such "mucoid cysts" are not 
malignant, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
"Feels fine," the President said of his finger after the 25-minute procedure. 
"They . . . went right deep down into the -- near the bone apparently -- but I 
think the doctor felt it was a good thing to do. But it's real minor and it's 
healed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out of some sports for a few days, but other than that it's fine, just 
fine," said Bush, who is left-handed, as he emerged from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mucus Under Skin 
</P>
<P>
A mucoid cyst is a formation of mucus growing under the skin. It developed over 
the past three years near the joint nearest the tip of the President's middle 
finger. It was approximately one centimeter in diameter, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted under a local anesthetic that numbed the entire 
finger. The "digital nerve block" was expected to wear off by late afternoon, 
and pain medication was prescribed if needed, Fitzwater said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
A 1 1/2-inch incision was made at the top of the finger to reach the cyst, and 
eight stitches were made to close the wound. They will be removed in about two 
weeks, and the President will wear a splint on the finger for two to three 
weeks, the press secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impairment Not Expected 
</P>
<P>
No long-term impairment of the movement of the finger was expected. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was conducted by Dr. Allen Smith, a colonel in the Army medical 
corps and chief of hand surgery at Walter Reed, and by Dr. George Bogumill, 
chief of hand surgery at Georgetown University Hospital. The anesthetic was 
administered by Dr. Charles Gandy, an Army lieutenant colonel stationed at 
Walter Reed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Problem: A mucoid cyst had filled with bursa fluid, pressing on the root of 
the fingernail and causing deformity and discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The Procedure: Doctors made an incision along the length of the cyst, tunneling 
down to the root of the cyst. The finger will be in a splint for two to three 
weeks.

SEATTLE RENEWS ATTEMPT TO MAKE BUSING WORK; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS TEST 'CONTROLLED CHOICE' PLAN; SOME PARENTS CALL IT 'CONTROLLED CHAOS' 
</P>

<P>
School officials have a name for the new racial busing plan that went into 
effect last month: controlled choice. 
</P>
<P>
Some unhappy parents have another name for it: controlled chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the attempt to revive a faltering 12-year effort at school racial 
integration is being quickly tested before facing a non-binding referendum of 
the electorate in November. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle is now the biggest school district in the nation to try controlled 
choice. The busing plan was first designed by Cambridge, Mass., as an 
alternative to the 1970s mandatory busing in neighboring Boston that fostered 
violence and resistence. At least nine cities nationwide are believed to be 
trying some form of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Litmus Test 
</P>
<P>
After a summer in which an alleged resurgence of racism was a hot topic in 
movies, television documentaries and the media, this renewed attempt by Seattle 
to make busing work -- in a liberal, mostly white city -- may prove a litmus 
test of school integration. 
</P>
<P>
Controlled choice offers parents a carrot: "magnet" schools that offer varied 
curriculums to lure students across town. But if the magnets fail to draw 
enough students, mandatory busing to achieve racial balance still can be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The district recently won $3.3 million in federal funds to help create magnet 
schools with specialties in subjects from performing arts to careers in the 
aircraft industry. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can choose from schools located in one of several geographic clusters 
in the city, but getting their choice hinges on whether it will enable a school 
to meet the district's integration guidelines. Schools are not supposed to be 
more than 70% minority or have more than 50% of a single minority. 
</P>
<P>
The new program got off to a rocky start Sept. 6. Some angry parents waited 
four hours at school district information centers before being told an 
overburdened computer system could still not place their late-registering 
children in schools. Hundreds of students throughout the district were left 
unregistered. 
</P>
<P>
Others parents complained their kindergartners were riding buses up to 2 1/2 
hours for 2 1/2 hours of school. 
</P>
<P>
And 3,000 expected students initially didn't show up at all. 
</P>
<P>
But problems are being ironed out. Students are assigned and parents are less 
confused. Although figures are still being compiled, school administrators 
believe the enrollment is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's school district says that under controlled choice, 93% of the 
students got their first or second choice of schools this September, many of 
them closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
The district says only 13% of the students are presently bused solely for 
racial integration as compared to 50% under the old plan. 
</P>
<P>
"People are feeling quite good," school district Supt. William Kendrick said. 
"We've greatly reduced the number of students with mandatory busing 
assignments." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to save a lot of money on transportation we can put into 
education," promised Ellen Roe, a school board member who was the lone board 
opponent of Seattle's 1977 mandatory busing plan and a crusader for this 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick, who has spent his three years at the helm of Seattle's schools 
pushing the new plan into place, was optimistic it could stem the erosion of 
students from his district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Drop 
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years of mandatory busing, Seattle's student population has 
fallen from 54,000 to about 42,000 -- leading to painful budget cuts -- and the 
percentage that is minority has climbed from 33% to 54%. 
</P>
<P>
But the debut of controlled choice was hampered by an administrative snarl as 
overtaxed administrators and computers struggled to juggle the students into 
racial, academic and geographic balance. 
</P>
<P>
T. J. Vassar, the black chairman of the school board, said controlled choice 
should not be judged from the first-day confusion. "The job is bigger than we 
thought it was, and we're suffering from its magnitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the experiment progressed, Vassar said the parent reaction to the new plan 
"may be 50-50 pro and con, judging from what I have heard personally." 
</P>
<P>
But a formal judgment is not far away. On the November city ballot is a 
citizens' initiative that in effect calls on Seattle to abandon racial busing 
and go back to open enrollment and neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Busing is ignorant of human nature," said Kathy Baxter, a white parent 
spearheading the initiative. "It ignores what people are likely to do and pays 
attention to what people ought to do." 
</P>
<P>
She contends busing has driven out the middle class from a community that 
didn't have serious racial problems in the first place and replaced it with a 
city "resegregated economically." 
</P>
<P>
The busing issue has become a factor in school board races, with busing 
opponents hoping to elect three members this fall who would provide the margin 
to abandon controlled choice. It also has become the central issue in the 
mayoral race, even though mayors have no control over schools. A white 
Republican and controlled choice opponent, Doug Jewett, is facing off for the 
mayor's seat against a black Democrat, Norm Rice, who favors the program. 
</P>
<P>
If school integration can work in any big city, it should work in Seattle. The 
city of approximately 490,000 is just 23% minority, with Asians and blacks at 
about 9% each and the remainder Native Americans and Latinos. And politically, 
the Emerald City's population is largely liberal, voting heavily Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Escapes Court Order 
</P>
<P>
So it wasn't surprising when in 1977 the Seattle school board voted 6 to 1 to 
adopt compulsory busing after a voluntary plan had failed. Seattle was the 
first big city to do so without a court order. (In contrast, the Los Angeles 
Unified School District underwent nearly three years of court-ordered mandatory 
busing that ended in 1981 and now offers voluntary integration programs, 
including magnet schools and a transfer policy that allows students from 
racially isolated neighborhoods to attend the school of their choice.) 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's compulsory busing program swiftly ran into problems. Some of the 
richest, whitest neighborhoods were effectively exempted from busing of 
elementary children to maintain political support. 
</P>
<P>
And the same geography that makes Seattle a pretty city made it a nightmare to 
thread buses through. Long and narrow, Seattle is cut by hills, waterways and 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Bus rides were long, and their administration often nonsensical, some parents 
charged. Minorities in white neighborhoods, or white children in black 
neighborhoods, were sometimes bused across town instead of helping balance 
neighborhood schools where they already were. 
</P>
<P>
Some whites and blacks who applauded the social goal moved in frustration to 
the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistically," said former Mayor Wes Uhlman, "there's no question that the 
plan hasn't really worked. I view it as a failed experiment, though a noble 
one. We accelerated white flight with the experiment." 
</P>
<P>
Despite integration and repeated reforms, minority test scores have stayed 
stubbornly 20 to 40 percentage points below that of whites. And blacks were 
also disciplined twice as often as whites, district studies found. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, the rising ratio of minorities meant balancing numbers got 
harder, not easier. By 1988, Seattle had the same number of schools flunking 
integration guidelines as when busing had started. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite all these problems, public hearings on Seattle's busing program did 
not turn up a consensus to abandon it, even though the threat of court-ordered 
busing seemed more remote. In fact, a recent Chamber of Commerce poll showed 
general satisfaction with the schools. 
</P>
<P>
If controlled choice works as hoped, busing will not be eliminated. But 
students who once could expect to be bounced among two or even three elementary 
schools are now guaranteed the chance to stay through all six grades. Ditto for 
junior high and high school. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion remains sharply divided in Seattle on busing's cost and benefits. 
Uhlman, for example, said busing seemed to worsen the racial attitudes of his 
own son, and Baxter, the anti-busing initiative leader, blames it for emptying 
some heavily targeted white neighborhoods of families. 
</P>
<P>
Others say the city's changing demographics had little to do with busing. "I 
don't think we have a white flight problem," Vassar, the school board chairman, 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of busing's effect on students has been equally conflicting. There are 
many accounts of students making friends across racial lines, countered by 
others where students separated in seating and socializing by race. 
</P>
<P>
And some believe that school integration has promoted more social and 
residential mixing of adults. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "a lot more minorities live all over the city," said school board member 
Roe. 
</P>
<P>
"It has allowed people to get together, not only kids but parents as well," 
said high school Principal Andres Tangalin, who has been in the district 17 
years. "Through that they get new impressions and insights they didn't have 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Eason Jr. was chairman of the citizens committee that led the three-year 
effort to junk the old busing plan and try controlled choice. While he hopes 
the new system works, the black activist does not agree with critics of the old 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes busing," he said, "but history has shown that separate is not 
equal. Minority schools simply deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
Is Seattle's experience, then, a success? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," said Eason. "If we hadn't had busing, I'd shudder to think what racism 
would be like in our society today." 
</P>

Angeles Times.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WEIGHS LAWS TO BAN HUD-STYLE INFLUENCE-PEDDLING ABUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Justice Department lawyers are considering proposing legislation to outlaw some 
of the kinds of influence peddling that have been revealed by investigations of 
Housing and Urban Development programs, the head of the department's criminal 
division said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis Jr. said that ethics and 
conflict-of-interest laws that focus on conduct of government employees after 
they leave federal employment do not appear to cover the actions disclosed by 
congressional hearings into the HUD scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis would not outline what legislative possibilities are under 
consideration. He indicated that measures would not be proposed soon. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings by the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing have developed evidence that political favoritism influenced HUD's 
administration of some housing programs, with Republican consultants picking up 
six-figure fees for representing developers before the department. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, in an interview, said he did not want his comments to signal that the 
Justice Department has decided that the hearings have raised "no question of 
criminality." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say they have," he said. "We can't say they haven't. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be exploring areas we feel are appropriate to be explored," Dennis 
said. But he repeatedly emphasized the difficulties of prosecuting individuals 
who meet with federal officials in an attempt to obtain government grants. 
</P>
<P>
"Listening is never a problem," Dennis said. "People should have access to 
their government. The question of whether a decision (to award a grant) has 
been influenced is difficult to judge. On a criminal basis, it's a very 
difficult area to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis added that lawmakers and lobbyists naturally represent their 
constituents and clients before federal agencies. "It's the duty of senators 
and lobbyists to weigh in on behalf of their area," he said. "That's good. 
That's what you want." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Dennis contended, HUD investigations "continue to be a 
priority item in the criminal division and the attorney general's office." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the HUD disclosures by the House subcommittee, Justice 
Department officials have said they are investigating 700 cases of alleged HUD 
fraud and related violations. However, these cases involve primarily low-level 
HUD officials and contractors and not the political appointees who have been 
the focus of the House subcommittee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Transcripts 
</P>
<P>
Stuart E. Weisberg, staff director of the House subcommittee, said Justice 
Department officials did not request transcripts of the panel's hearings until 
Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a HUD audit made public Friday showed that errors in 
calculating rents for subsidized housing are costing the federal government 
millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
The rent study, obtained by the Associated Press under the Freedom of 
Information Act, involved a review by HUD's inspector general of 142 of the 
2,755 areas for which the department sets fair-market rents for subsidized 
housing. He found that, in 116 of those areas, the government was paying as 
much as $39.1 million a year in excessive subsidies.

'FESTERING HATRED' FUELED STOCKTON KILLER; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLYARD MASSACRE LINKED TO TREND OF ATTACKS ON MINORITIES

A "festering hatred" of racial and ethnic minorities drove Patrick Purdy to 
massacre five children in a Stockton schoolyard last January, an extreme 
example of a growing trend of hate crimes, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In an extensive report on the life, habits and psychological makeup of the 
troubled young drifter who killed himself after firing 105 rounds from an AK-47 
into the crowded Cleveland Elementary School playground, Van de Kamp said his 
investigators concluded that the 24-year-old had been obsessed with a hatred of 
Cambodians, Indians, Pakistanis and especially Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Even his last known spoken words -- made to a fellow guest at a cheap motel in 
Stockton as he prepared to get into his car for the drive to the Cleveland 
School -- reflected that obsession, the report said. As the other guest 
remembered it, there was a joking reference to the fact that the motel was 
operated by a Hindu family and then the final words from Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
"The damn Hindus and boat people own everything," he was quoted as saying. A 
short time later, five Southeast Asian children were dead and 30 other 
children, mostly minorities, and one teacher were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, such sentiments are common in California -- whether they are directed 
at immigrant groups or at native-born minorities like blacks, Jews and 
Hispanics," Van de Kamp said. "Most people who believe and say such things are 
not so dangerous and unstable as Patrick Purdy. But it is no coincidence that 
the number of racially and ethnically motivated crimes in California is rising 
rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, said the 
investigation had been requested by Asian-American groups worried that the 
killings were part of an organized attack on new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report found that Purdy acted alone, Van de Kamp said he had also 
hoped to reassure ethnic groups that the killer's decision to attack a school 
with a predominance of Southeast Asian-American children was merely a "tragic 
coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
"The truth proved otherwise," he said. "Purdy was filled with hate and anger 
toward many groups of people, including virtually all ethnic minorities. But in 
the last days of his life it seems clear that he had focused on Stockton's 
large and highly visible population of Southeast Asian immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Minami, a San Francisco lawyer who is chairman of the attorney general's 
Asian/Pacific Islander Advisory Committee, said leaders of Asian-American 
groups were disturbed by initial reports that found little racial motivation 
for the crime. He said they believed that it was important "for our peace of 
mind" to confirm that racial hatred was a factor so that attention could be 
focused on it and "we could begin to fashion remedies and solutions." 
</P>
<P>
"For Asian-Pacific Americans the report confirms a disturbing fact, that 
violence and hostility against Asian-Pacific Americans is a growing trend in 
this state," Minami said. "In this sense Patrick Purdy's attitude toward 
Asian-Pacific Americans is not simply an aberration but a more frightening omen 
of what could become a theme in California in the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that California, more than any other state, has had to assimilate huge 
numbers of ethnic minorities, Van de Kamp recommended that schools be 
encouraged to develop curriculums that includes instruction in human relations 
and ethnic studies and that communities establish human relations centers to 
work with local organizations to "respond to and prevent hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
The investigators who prepared the attorney general's report, however, devoted 
most of their efforts to sketching a portrait of Purdy, whom they described as 
hopelessly alienated from society by a turbulent childhood in which he was 
provided no love and little stability. 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Yarvis, former chief psychiatrist for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
traveled across the country to interview family members and acquaintances for a 
psychological autopsy, an investigatory device commonly used to study suicidal 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
While there were gaps in the evidence he was able to gather, Yarvis concluded 
that Purdy had "compensated for his own feelings of powerlessness and 
inadequacy by shifting blame to others and by rationalizing that he was 
unsuccessful only because of unfair favoritism to others who were receiving 
government support while he was not."

SOME NUNS LEAVE AUSCHWITZ CONVENT, JEWISH LEADER SAYS

A majority of the nuns at the disputed Carmelite convent at Auschwitz have 
left, and the Polish government has said that all of them could be moved out 
before an alternate facility is built, a World Jewish Congress official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
WJC vice president Kalman Sultanik said that he learned on a recent trip to 
Warsaw that eight of the 15 nuns have already left. 
</P>
<P>
Polish church officials last month agreed to move the nuns to an interfaith 
center outside the death camp grounds after months of international 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Jews wanted the convent moved to keep Auschwitz as a silent tribute to the 4 
million people, more than half of them Jews, who were killed there by the 
Germans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish church decision came after the Vatican intervened in the dispute and 
sided with church and Jewish officials who two years ago agreed that the nuns 
should leave. Pope John Paul II is a former Polish cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
Sultanik said that Polish government officials told him it was possible that 
the nuns would be completely relocated soon at their own request.

'LORAX' SURVIVES AX, STILL ON READING LIST; 
</P>
<P>
AUDIENCE CHEERS LAYTONVILLE SCHOOL BOARD DECISION TO KEEP BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The school board of a tiny Northern California logging town has unanimously 
voted to continue requiring its second graders to read a Dr. Seuss book that 
two prominent local families charge is a thinly veiled attack on the timber 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a flood of television lights and national press attention, the Laytonville 
School Board rejected the request to remove from its second grade core reading 
list "The Lorax," a 1971 book about a fuzzy-headed creature who fights a 
fruitless battle against the devastation of a make-believe forest. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was greeted by thunderous applause from the more than 200 
onlookers and students who jammed the cafeteria of the elementary school in 
this town 150 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Author 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Seuss is the pen name of Theodor Seuss Geisel of La Jolla, who for decades 
has charmed young readers with his rhyming whimsy. He is the author of more 
than 40 books such as "The Cat in the Hat" and "How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
In September, Judith Bailey, the wife of a wealthy Laytonville lumber supplier, 
petitioned the board to remove "The Lorax" from the required reading list, 
instead making it alternative reading. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing controversy struck at the growing tension in Laytonville between 
established logging families and newcomers from urban areas, many of whom 
believe Northern California's forests are a precious commodity and should be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compared to Book Burning 
</P>
<P>
Some residents claimed the loggers' actions were tantamount to book burning. 
Others snickered that the woodsmen wanted to "Ax the Lorax, lynch the Grinch." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, school board President William Webster spoke of the divided 
community when he opened the meeting by quipping, "Welcome to 'Family Feud.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later -- time that included sometimes heated remarks from board and 
community members alike -- Webster summed up the board's sentiments to a chorus 
of appreciative hoots and hollers. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to go into the classroom . . . to say which book you can teach . . . is 
about as appropriate as a group of teachers going into the woods" to decide 
which trees to cut down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exercise in power and ignorance and futility. We are insulting our 
children -- who do we think we are kidding? We are telling these children 'We 
need to protect you from certain ideas.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's in conflict with everything the United States stands for. Let's let the 
teachers teach. Let's let the students learn." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers believed the loggers' efforts were a dangerous strike at their 
professional integrity. Their numbers included teachers' association members 
from as far away as the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
At first, things did not look good for either "The Lorax" or the concept of a 
core reading list for second graders as board members discussed alternatives 
for the book -- talk that included moving it to the core literature list for 
seventh graders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Ordered 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the board voted to keep the book on the reading list but assigned 
School Supt. Brian Buckley to review the use of core and extended literature 
lists as part of the district's language arts curriculum and report back at a 
later date. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, parents who object to any literary work used in the classroom 
can ask for a comparable book to be used by their child, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Burgess, a Laytonville high school senior, told the board, however, 
that the town's children at least had no problem with the book. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of students polled said they wanted to keep the book on the 
reading list, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One angry parent told the board that if the book went, he would take his two 
children out of the public school.

JAZZ FANS SING THE BLUES OVER KKGO SWITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About a dozen die-hard jazz fans and musicians have launched a campaign to 
fight KKGO-FM's plans to move its jazz programming to an AM station and replace 
it with classical music. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that for 30 years KKGO has been the sole provider of the full spectrum 
of jazz on FM radio, and L.A. has become the second-largest jazz community, so 
it's crucial to keep KKGO playing jazz on FM," said Ellen S. Cohn, the 
organizer of the protest and vice president of Chase Music Group, a jazz and 
blues record label. "We're not against classical music. We just don't want to 
see jazz relegated to an AM ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn and other KKGO-FM (92.3) fans met Thursday night at Le Cafe, a Sherman 
Oaks restaurant and jazz club, to discuss ways to stop the station from 
switching formats. KKGO had played only jazz until last month, when it added 
classical music to its playlist from 5-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. daily. KKGO general 
manager and president Saul Levine said that he hoped to fill the void left when 
all-classical KFAC-FM changed its format to urban rock on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a war between the jazzies and the classical people," Cohn said. "I 
think what (Levine) is trying to do is admirable: He's trying to preserve two 
art forms in L.A. . . . It's just that we got here first." 
</P>
<P>
In January, KKGO-FM will become all classical, and the jazz that had been 
played on the station will then be heard on an AM station now under 
construction, which Levine also owns. The call letters for the AM station are 
tentatively set as KKJZ (K-JAZZ, 540). 
</P>
<P>
The jazz fans maintain that the sound quality will be inferior on AM. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the actual broadcast signal is not as good as on FM," Cohn said. 
"That's the basic objection. The quality of the broadcast is not going to be 
good as what FM offers." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters said they plan to circulate petitions at jazz clubs around 
Southern California in an attempt to pressure advertisers. They also will 
conduct a mail campaign urging the station to retain the jazz format on FM. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz has always been scrappy anyway, we just thought we'd be scrappy," Cohn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But when contacted by telehone Friday, Levine remained firm in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I fully sympathize with their feelings and that's why we're putting it on the 
AM," Levine said. "We will still be an outlet for these artists and this is our 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
Levine added that if enough listeners fought his switching jazz to the AM 
station, the "economic realities" might force him to turn it into it a rock 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said that KKGO's low ratings forced the move. The latest Arbitron 
survey, released earlier this week, showed that only 1% of the audience 
listened to KKGO during any given quarter-hour period.

In a time when movies about American Indians are few and far between, some say 
they welcome projects that give them exposure and badly needed jobs. But is 
being represented, no matter how you're portrayed, really enough? Other members 
of the Indian community say no. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the reactions after a recent screening of "War Party," an action-drama 
about three modern-day Blackfeet Indian youths who become full-fledged warriors 
after tensions escalate between Indian and racist white groups. About 160 
members of the local Indian community "clapped and whistled several times" and 
were "real happy" about seeing some of their friends in the film, said Kevin 
Hart, secretary of the American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts, the 
group that sponsored the screening. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Christina Wiktah, a screenwriter and member of the Wichita Indians: 
"It's a shame that Native American children so often see themselves portrayed 
as alcoholics, criminals and savages. It's understandable that per capita, the 
highest suicide rate in America lies among young Native Americans. These are 
children that need so desperately to have positive role models on TV and in 
film. What they don't need is another film that sends a message of suicide to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
A "message of suicide" is exactly what Wiktah says "War Party" is about. In the 
film's climax, the two main characters (played by Billy Wirth and Kevin Dillon) 
decide to "go down as warriors" rather than surrender to a group of National 
Guardsmen who have them trapped in the hills. The modern-day braves face the 
gunfire of their trackers by riding their horses directly into the group to 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"It was surely the most depressing ending I've ever seen in my life," Wiktah 
said. "The only message this film seemed to convey is that suicide is the only 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
Full-blood Creek/Seminole Indian Bob Hicks agreed: "We're always being 
portrayed as victims and we're always dying. Somehow they always like to see us 
dead. Somehow, it's that 'that's the only good kind of Indian' mentality." 
</P>
<P>
But according to the film's director, Franc Roddam, his original ending was not 
so severe. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was that they faced death nobly," said the British film maker. "I 
wanted it to be glorious, like in a samurai movie. It was intended as an act of 
defiance, not violence." 
</P>
<P>
But the film's emphasis was completely changed, Roddam said, when producer John 
Daly altered the film without Roddam's participation or knowledge. In Roddam's 
cut of the film, the Indians face the National Guardsmen's gunfire without 
firing a single shot, he said. Not so in the final version. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine my surprise when I went to see the picture (at a screening in Great 
Falls, Mont., for the Indians of the Blackfeet Reservation in nearby Browning, 
where the film was shot) and found that a gunshot had been added, so that the 
Indians fire first," Roddam said with a sigh. "Now, when the National Guard 
fires back, it looks as if the Indians are getting what they deserve. Which is 
not what I'd intended at all." 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokeswoman, John Daly said that it wasn't his idea to add the 
gunshot from the Indians. "The idea came from one of the editors. But I thought 
it was a great idea and I still do." 
</P>
<P>
Roddam added that a minute that was excised from the ending "takes away much of 
the texture of the sequence and intensifies the violence." 
</P>
<P>
Some Indians at the screening complained about the portrayal of medicine man 
Ben Crowkiller (Dennis Banks) as the town drunk. 
</P>
<P>
"A medicine man is regarded like a holy person -- like a Pope," said Hicks, a 
film maker himself ("The Turn of the Country," "The Trial of Standing Bear"). 
"But here this medicine man was drunk on the streets. I was especially 
disappointed in that." 
</P>
<P>
Added Adelle Allison, a Huron/Cherokee and communications director of the 
American Indian Registry: "Anyone who's a true traditionalist doesn't drink 
because it's not our way. It takes away from the whole concept of 
spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
Despite what he called the unrealistic elements of the film (such as the 
drunken medicine man and the Indian youths' constant use of four-letter words), 
Hicks hopes the movie is "successful and makes money, because then we can have 
more movies about Indians. If it goes down the tubes then Hollywood will say, 
'Indian movies can't make money' and no more will get made." 
</P>
<P>
("War Party," opened last weekend to dismal business. Grosses were just 
$299,356 in 347 theaters, an average of just $863 per theater.) 
</P>
<P>
Allison noted that while the lead characters were played by whites, many of the 
supporting roles were filled by Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes people very proud to see that we're out there and doing things, and 
many will get enjoyment from seeing our people working," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Monty Bass, who has a small non-speaking role in "War Party," agreed. For 
once, the Sac/Sox and Creek Indian said, Indians are presented in a way that 
can change the old stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the film) is going to change a lot of things, a lot of opinions, of 
the way people view natives. It's going to do a lot to change people's minds 
about Indian people -- and change them so they see us as regular people." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Wirth, who has the lead role in the film, agreed. "A movie has been made 
about people that have feelings and emotions, and jobs, and go to town 
meetings," he said. "We've never before seen the way the Indians really live, 
and so in that sense, it's a move in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Wirth, who has a small bit of Indian blood in his own background (from his 
great-great-grand-mother on his mother's side), said making the film certainly 
opened his mind about the Indian people. He said he learned a lot from the 
people on the Blackfeet Reservation, and now wants to find out more about his 
Indian heritage. He has even hired a genealogist to trace his roots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spending time on the reservation, Wirth said, made him want to produce a film 
that would leave behind a message, something that would "bring to light that 
two cultures' not being able to get along together (can) result in tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, he said, while the film started out with a "happy" ending in which the 
boys were brought down from the hills safely, he and co-star Dillon and 
director Roddam came up with an alternative ending, which was changed long 
before the disputed gunshots were added. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally we live, and everybody lives happily ever after, and that brings 
false hope," Wirth said. "Our ending might be tragic, but hopefully it might 
evoke some feelings of compassion, or some response, and bring to light that 
when two societies are living side by side and not communicating or working 
together, the end result is a tragic one." 
</P>
<P>
Added Roddam about the movie's first ending: "It began to look like one of 
those hokey endings where the cavalry rides in. We decided that, after what had 
happened, the Indians weren't going to (legally) get off. We decided not to 
make a movie about infallible heroes." 
</P>
<P>
While Wirth admitted that some Indians could be very saddened by the film's 
tragic ending, he said the movie does, indeed, contain hope for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope doesn't come in the story of the movie; it comes in whether the 
audience is moved or feels anything after seeing this movie," Wirth said. "If 
they do feel anything, then there's hope, and they can bring it up and talk of 
it and learn about other cultures."

POP BEAT: CERVENKA'S NEW LIFE AS AN OLD WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The past two years have brought major changes to the life of Exene Cervenka. As 
vocalist with the seminal L.A. band X, Cervenka was the high priestess of the 
L.A. punk scene from 1976 to 1987, when the members of X wandered off to work 
on various solo projects. (For the record, the group is not officially broken 
up, but hasn't recorded a studio album in nearly three years.) 
</P>
<P>
During her tenure with X, Cervenka's persona was that of a dark and brooding 
loner with a stormy disposition fueled on despair and rage. Fans who quaked in 
her formidable presence then would hardly recognize her today. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a Hollywood coffee shop for an early-morning chat before racing off 
to catch a plane, Cervenka is noticeably more relaxed and open than she was 
when she stood at the center of the roiling punk scene. The radiantly happy 
mother of an 18-month-old son, Henry, she left the fast track of Los Angeles -- 
the city that was like a muse for X -- for life in a tiny town in Idaho, where 
she has lived for a year with her husband, actor Viggo Mortenson. Her neighbors 
know nothing of her glory days in Los Angeles, nor that she recently released 
her first solo LP, "Old Wives' Tales." And that's how she wants it. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved to Idaho because I wanted to live in a place that still had mountains, 
lakes and trees," she says as she struggles to get breakfast into her baby 
rather than on the floor. "I thought that would be a nice place to raise my 
son, and I've found I really love it there. I doubt if anyone there ever heard 
of X and that's fine, because I didn't go there to be a musician -- I went 
there not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
She loved Los Angeles when she first moved here from St. Petersburg, Fla., "and 
as a writer I was inspired by the duality of wealth and poverty you find here. 
I'd never lived in a city prior to coming here, so it was thrilling to me in 
many ways. But there came a point where living here was the root of all my 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Though Cervenka's love affair with Los Angeles is over, she spent a good amount 
of time here this year working on "Old Wives' Tales," a politicized synthesis 
of folk, punk and country that Cervenka describes as "a record for and about 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"Women have it harder than men in this society and I don't see that improving 
-- in fact, women seem to be getting more unliberated. With people like Madonna 
as role models for young girls, women are being taught that what's important is 
to be wealthy and sexy, and that they should use the same rotten rules men have 
always used to be powerful in a man's world." 
</P>
<P>
Cervenka's feisty views on sexual politics played a central role in the writing 
she did with X, and they haven't changed. However, the 10 songs on "Old Wives' 
Tales" are markedly different from her earlier work in several respects. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote the music for these songs and I never wrote music with X," she says. 
"I always wanted to, but every time I committed myself to learning the guitar 
something would come up. I not only finally found the time in Idaho, but I had 
to learn because there was nobody else around to put music to my lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also writing about different things now -- the biggest change being that I 
don't write about myself anymore. I've lost interest in autobiographical 
writing because it's selfish, limiting, and I grew bored with it. I used to 
turn to writing about myself when I was totally miserable, but I'm really happy 
now, so it doesn't serve that purpose for me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Featuring guest vocals by Eliza Gilkyson and Julie Christensen, "Old Wives' 
Tales" is for the most part a one-woman show, with Exene carrying the weight of 
the record alone. But she is eager to share credit with producer Tony Gilkyson, 
X's guitarist and a member of her touring band. 
</P>
<P>
"My credibility as a musician has always seemed to be predicated on my 
involvement with X and John," she says, referring to John Doe, the band's 
bassist-singer and her husband for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"When John and I split up, certain male musicians treated me differently. I 
guess they never really respected me -- I was just part of the baggage that 
came along with X and John. Tony's always been great as far as encouraging me, 
and that's why I wanted him to produce my record. He really believes in me and 
thinks I can sing and write songs. I wouldn't have made this record without 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Though Cervenka's other former bandmates are conspicuous in their absence, 
their musical imprint can be detected on several songs. Fans hungry for new 
music by this well-loved group have latched onto a raucous track titled "He's 
Got a She" as being in X's style, but Cervenka disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's a little peppier, people are saying that's like an X song but 
it's really not. In fact, when I played that song for John, he said it was 
pretty good but that it would be better if I put some more chords here and 
there -- in other words, if I turned it into an X song," she says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"John and I are still involved in one another's work -- I stayed with him on 
this trip to L.A. -- but we haven't worked on songs together for a while. X's 
contract with Elektra is done and we haven't figured out if the band is 
together or not. We're all busy with other things right now, but if we wanted 
to do a benefit for a good cause I think we could." 
</P>
<P>
The main thing Cervenka's busy with right now is gearing up for a three-week 
tour of the East Coast (she'll do some L.A. dates in late November) that will 
reflect her intensified commitment to social activism. 
</P>
<P>
"This'll be a real low-budget tour and we'll travel very sparsely -- it'll be 
four guys in a van with a trailer. I want to do as many benefits as I can, and 
I plan to invite charities and activist groups to set up booths at the shows. I 
probably won't make any money on the tour but that's OK. If people buy my 
record and come and see me, that's nice."

SOUTHLAND AIRWAVES SPEAK TO BOOMING CHINESE POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A picture of a satellite spiraled across a television screen as anchor David 
Huang straightened in his seat in a Rosemead studio, preparing to greet 
Chinese-speaking viewers all over North America with the latest world news. 
</P>
<P>
Delivered by satellite to audiences in the United States, Canada, Mexico and 
the Caribbean, his half-hour broadcast is designed as a cornerstone of N. A. 
Television Corp., the latest newcomer in Southern California's competitive 
Chinese-language broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day that N. A. Television made its debut last week, a new 
Chinese-language radio station called Voice of Democracy also joined the 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Station owner Shi Chang Chen said he has been planning to start a radio station 
for two years. After the June military crackdown in Beijing, he decided to name 
his station Voice of Democracy as a way of continuing the spirit of the 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Based in South Pasadena, the station broadcasts on an FM subcarrier frequency. 
To receive its programs, listeners must buy a special radio that the station 
sells for $40. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the new broadcast companies hope to carve out a slice of Southern 
California's growing Chinese market, estimated at more than 200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The total could be as high as 500,000, said Rosemary Fincher Danon, general 
manager of Los Angeles-based KSCI-TV Channel 18, the independent station that 
leases air time to six local Chinese television broadcast companies. The 
station also leases time for programs in 15 other languages, from Italian to 
Farsi. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the latest entries in the Chinese broadcast industry, there are nine 
Chinese-language television companies and four radio stations in Los Angeles 
alone. Many offer service programs, such as English lessons and immigration 
information. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Chinese Outreach, a nonprofit, Christian radio 
programming group that airs no commercials during its 2-hour weekly program, 
all of the broadcast firms hope to attract advertisers, who are increasingly 
interested in reaching Chinese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers are starting to realize the strength of this market," Danon said, 
citing the Bank of America, Alpha Beta supermarkets and the California Lottery 
as examples. 
</P>
<P>
But Irene Young, general manager of Joint Art Media Corp., an Alhambra 
advertising firm, said she is still reluctant to recommend that her clients 
advertise on Chinese-language television or radio programs. She suggests 
instead that most of them advertise in Chinese-language newspapers, which reach 
about 60% of the Chinese community, she said. In comparison, Chinese broadcast 
programs generally reach, at best, 35% of the community. 
</P>
<P>
For clients who want to reach the elderly and housewives, however, Young said 
that television and radio may work well. Those two groups of viewers often 
watch Chinese-language television, now available on Channel 18 from noon to 3 
p.m. and other time slots scattered through the day and night, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the competitive Chinese-language television market, N. A. Television is the 
first to utilize satellite transmission, enabling it to reach audiences outside 
of metropolitan areas, said Jesse Hsiao, secretary of the board. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike programs on Channel 18, which viewers from Ventura to San Diego 
counties can watch free, the satellite programs can only be received through a 
miniature satellite dish and special receiver that together sell for $499. The 
dish weighs barely 25 pounds and is no wider than a card table. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Little Ear," the dish is popular in Taiwan, where it gained acceptance 
during the 1988 Olympics. Viewers wanting more complete coverage of the games 
used them to receive Japanese television coverage from Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Including tax, shipping and installation, viewers would incur a one-time cost 
of $600 to $700 for the satellite service, said Sandy Hsueh, a spokeswoman for 
North America Telecommunication Corp., a Rosemead company that works with 
satellite dish distributors. 
</P>
<P>
By turning a dial, "Little Ear" viewers can hear programs in either Cantonese 
or Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
But Channel 18's Danon said she does not feel threatened by competition from 
the satellite television company. She said that paid Chinese-language programs, 
such as those offered on Choice Cable's Jade channel, have never hurt business 
for producers who air Chinese programs on her station. 
</P>
<P>
"Free over-the-air programming is always going to have its place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still in a "test broadcasting" period, during which it offers just 2 hours of 
programming a night, N. A. Television is trying to iron out glitches in its 
programs before its formal launch in January, 1990. In addition to soap operas 
and variety shows produced in Hong Kong or Taiwan, the company will offer 
locally produced news and "magazine style" shows, and is in the process of 
fine-tuning those programs. 
</P>
<P>
The first magazine show to air last week introduced viewers to Muscle Beach and 
dancing skaters in Venice. News broadcasts feature CNN clips and film reports 
flown in from Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said the company is trying to speed up its news service even more in 
order to satisfy viewer demand for up-to-date information. 
</P>
<P>
Competition among the Chinese-language broadcast stations centers on the news 
programs because that's what most viewers and listeners, especially those who 
cannot understand English-language news, want. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Voice of Democracy is emphasizing speedy news coverage by 
having correspondents in Hong Kong and Taiwan call in at least twice a day with 
breaking news. Other reports are sent by facsimile machine and are read by news 
announcers at the South Pasadena studio. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel like I'm reporting breaking news," said Perry Ni, a popular 
television personality from Taiwan who works as a disc jockey and talk show 
host at Voice of Democracy. He said that at other stations he has worked for, 
news announcers simply read newspaper reports, which most listeners probably 
had read.

'OLD GRINGO' DRAWS LATINO PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Where are the Mexicans?" "Mexicans Without Mejicanos?" "Jane Fonda and 
Columbia Exploits Mexican History." "The Story of Mexico for the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
Those were some of the placards carried by 25 Latino demonstrators who 
protested Thursday night outside the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences in Beverly Hills before a screening of Columbia Pictures' "Old 
Gringo," which stars Jane Fonda, Gregory Peck and Jimmy Smits as a Mexican 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sick of the 'Macho-Latino-lover' images that Hollywood creates about 
Mexicans to bring out the fantasy," said Raul Ruiz, a professor of Hispanic 
studies at Cal State Northridge, coordinator of the protest, which included 
members of several Mexican-American groups. 
</P>
<P>
While picketing, Virginia Reade chanted: "Jane Fonda is a racist. She promotes 
herself as a liberal? The director (Argentine Luis Puenzo) had to go to Mexico 
to learn the history of our country, the leading actor had to learn how to be a 
macho-Mexicano. . . . We also have Mexican stars." 
</P>
<P>
However, Steve Rivers, Fonda's spokesman, said: "Smits was just the best actor 
for the part. 'Old Gringo' is an American bilingual movie. This film is not 
about Mexico and the Mexican Revolution. Mexico is used only as a backdrop."

COACHELLA VALLEY'S LIVING DESERT SERVES AS OASIS OF PRESERVATION FOR MANY 
SPECIES 
</P>

<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY, McKinney is a free-lance columnist for The Times, who 
specializes in nature and the outdoors. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In proposing desert nature reserves, we should think of small ones as well as 
large ones. Small reserves to protect a particular landmark or other natural 
feature can be very satisfying. But large ones are most to be sought, for 
desert connotes vastness, great sweeps of land untouched by the often grimy 
hand of man, who is given to taking over the land and cluttering it with his 
"developments" of roads, subdivisions, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- E. Jaeger, "The California Deserts," 1933 
</P>
<P>
On your last visit to Palm Springs or Palm Desert, did you see more shops than 
succulents, more condos than cacti? Are you looking for an escape from Fairway 
Living and Rodeo Drive East? 
</P>
<P>
Try the Living Desert, an oasis within the oasis. Here's your chance to see 
Palm Springs wildlife, not to be confused with the Palm Springs wild life 
that's enjoyed by the thousands of college students who party hearty during 
spring break. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in Coachella Valley's Palm Desert, just around the corner from golf 
courses and neatly manicured subdivisions, the 1,200-acre Living Desert reserve 
provides visitors with a superb introduction to desert plant life, land forms 
and wildlife. It's a combination botanical garden hiking area and an accredited 
zoo. The nonprofit facility is dedicated to conservation, education and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve's botanical gardens represent major desert regions, including 
California's Mojave, Arizona's Sonoran and Mexico's Chihuahua. Among the 
assortment of about 1,000 species of plants found here are smoke trees and 
saguaros, palo verde and palms, brittle bush and barrel cactus. The reserve 
maintains a well-stocked nursery, where visitors may purchase many native 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife-watchers will enjoy observing animals rarely glimpsed in the wild. 
Among the species housed here are coyotes in their burrows and bighorn sheep 
perched on the rocky peaks of their enclosure. The walk-through aviary allows 
up-close views of a number of desert birds, and a pond includes water-loving 
species, including turtles, tortoises and the rare desert pupfish. 
</P>
<P>
Other exotic species here are the endangered slender-horn gazelle and the 
Arabian oryx, often referred to as "the unicorn of the desert." 
</P>
<P>
The Living Desert is currently abuzz with the news that a breeding pair of 
zebras was recently acquired and will soon be housed at the facility. Plans are 
in the works for a 26,000-square-foot exhibit called Eagle Canyon, which will 
spotlight threatened and endangered species, including the magnificent golden 
Eagle. Officials expect it to be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve's animal adoptions program allows individuals or groups, such as 
school classrooms, to donate funds for the care and feeding of species ranging 
from beetles to bighorns. Stumped by what to get Uncle Harry for his next 
birthday? Why not a year's care of a kit fox or screech owl? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educational Programs 
</P>
<P>
Children especially delight in the educational programs offered in the 
Discovery Room, where they participate in a variety of hands-on activities. 
Each year, the slide shows, guided tours, lectures and presentations provide a 
comprehensive introduction to desert wonders to more than 10,000 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the grounds of the reserve and the trails that lead away from the 
buildings that best capture the heart of the Living Desert. Here the reserve 
becomes what the great desert naturalist Edmund Jaeger envisioned when he wrote 
of the necessity for preserving representative sections of the California 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Six miles of self-guided trails lead past about 60 interpretive stops. A 
brittle bush-dotted flood plain and a desert wash with its moisture-loving 
vegetation of smoke trees, desert willows and palo verde are among the desert 
ecosystems that can be explored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Indians 
</P>
<P>
Many of the plants on display were of great use to the original inhabitants of 
the Coachella Valley, the Cahuilla Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the walk through the Living Desert uses a nature trail named 
for Jaeger. Leaving the developed desert behind, a path heads up an alluvial 
fan, past sand dunes and onto a plain that true desert rats call a bajada. Here 
you'll find a quail guzzler, which stores rainwater to aid California's state 
bird during the hot summer months. Trails also lead up toward the south slope 
of Eisenhower Mountain, the 1,952-foot bald peak named for the former president 
who was a part-time Palm Springs resident. 
</P>
<P>
On the south slope of Ike's peak is a picnic area and a plaque describing the 
region's date industry. The slope of Eisenhower Mountain, or any quiet place in 
the reserve, is a good spot to contemplate the Coachella Valley, the future of 
California's arid lands, the necessity of preserving our dry and empty places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calendar of Events 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its exhibits and educational programs, the Living Desert 
maintains a full calendar of events, including art exhibits and field trips. 
Newly reopened after its annual summer closure, the Living Desert promises 
visitors a full day of activities focused on the intriguing world of the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Special activities are also planned. On Oct. 21, there will be the 10th annual 
Concert on the Green, a fund-raising program featuring the Nelson Riddle 
Orchestra, conducted by Chris Riddle. On Thanksgiving weekend, a special 
program titled "Masters in Glass" will feature glass-blowing demonstrations and 
the sale of fine glassware. 
</P>
<P>
The Living Desert is at 47000 Portola Ave., Palm Desert 92260; phone (619) 
346-5694. The reserve is open daily, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission for adults, 
$5; children 6-15, $2; 5 and under, free. Seniors 62 and older pay $4.50.

HOWZAT? IT'S CRICKET; 
</P>
<P>
POPULAR FROM KARACHI TO KINGSTON, THE SPORT IS ALSO ALIVE AND WELL IN THE 
SOUTHLAND

<P>
"Howzat?" cries the bowler, flinging his arms up in appeal as he spins around 
to face the man in the long white coat standing behind him. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire pauses for a second or two, then lifts his right hand, the index 
finger extended. The verdict has been given: "Out." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two yards away, the batsman turns disconsolately from the wicket and 
walks off the pitch. His innings is over. He is out, leg-before-wicket, for a 
duck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Batsman at the Crease 
</P>
<P>
A new batsman comes to the crease, surveys the field and takes his stance. The 
wicket-keeper and the half-circle of slips inch forward in anticipation as the 
bowler returns to begin a new run-up. 
</P>
<P>
Gobbledygook? 
</P>
<P>
No, just cricket, a game that was already 500 years old when somebody with the 
unlikely name of Abner (or was it Alexander?) tinkered with the established 
English game of rounders and called his "invention" baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the "new" game's fans flock to Chavez Ravine and Anaheim Stadium, but on 
any given weekend during spring, summer and early fall, there are cricket 
matches being played from Santa Barbara to San Diego and from Los Angeles to 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The sport is alive and well hereabouts. In fact, Jean Wong, president of the 
Southern California Cricket Assn., says there are 26 teams playing in regular 
league competition during the March-to-October season. More than 500 cricketers 
from around the world are involved in the game locally. 
</P>
<P>
And all because of one man. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in Coldwater Canyon there is -- or at least there used to be, it's 
difficult to tell with such things -- a house with a rather unusual name. 
</P>
<P>
The Round Corner, as it was called, had a couple of other odd characteristics. 
Its weather vane, for instance, consisted of a bat and ball, while elsewhere 
atop the roof were three cricket stumps. 
</P>
<P>
Those who visited the house regularly -- men such as Errol Flynn and Boris 
Karloff, Nigel Bruce and Basil Rathbone, P. G. Wodehouse and David Niven -- 
knew what the rooftop eccentricities meant. They too were cricketers, though 
they had never reached the starry heights of the home's owner, C. Aubrey Smith, 
one-time captain of England and leader of Marylebone Cricket Club tours to 
Australia in 1887-88 and to South Africa in 1888-89. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Charles, knighted in 1944 for his work in improving Anglo-American 
relations, was one of those empire builders who carried the grand game to the 
colonies so that today the sound of willow bat striking leather ball is 
instantly recognizable from Karachi to Kingston and from Cape Town to 
Christchurch. 
</P>
<P>
A gifted athlete as well as actor, he managed to enjoy both careers to the 
fullest. Although he was a talented soccer player, it was cricket that was his 
true passion. 
</P>
<P>
Benny Green in his admirable "A History of Cricket" (David &amp; Charles, c/o 
Sterling Publishing, 2 Park Ave., New York 10016; $35), describes Smith as: "A 
bowler with a delivery so eccentric that all England knew him as 
'Round-the-Corner' Smith." Proud of the nickname, Smith later used it in naming 
his Hollywood Hills mansion, the one in Coldwater Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
It was his acting, however, that brought him to Los Angeles in 1930. By then, 
he was 68 and a household name among London theatergoers. In Hollywood, his 
oh-so-proper accent and his silver hair and mustache quickly earned him parts 
as the quintessential English gentleman in a string of movies such as "The Four 
Feathers," "Rebecca," "Lives of a Bengal Lancer" and "The Prisoner of Zenda." 
</P>
<P>
Between pictures, he founded the Hollywood Cricket Club, stocking its ranks 
with other expatriate Britons who had come to make their fortune in the movies. 
Some, like Laurence Olivier, resisted Smith's efforts and seldom played. Others 
were keen cricketers and even went on tour with the Hollywood club. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Smith's efforts and the glamour attached to his "star" players, the 
game never really caught on in Los Angeles. It was then, and remains now, a 
club sport played for the enjoyment of its participants, most of them 
immigrants from Commonwealth countries. To those not brought up with the sport, 
it appears baffling. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to describe cricket to someone who has never played the game," a local 
player once said, "is like trying to describe bridge to a novice card player. 
You cannot explain the intricacies of the game and the challenge it provides to 
someone who has not played it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Americans Ignore It 
</P>
<P>
Americans, by and large, therefore ignore it, and writers, when they are handed 
the task of "doing a cricket story" by their editors, invariably wind up poking 
fun at the sport's admittedly curious nomenclature (an easy thing in a game 
where fielders are called "silly mid-on" or "square leg," and bowlers send down 
"googlies" and "chinamen"). 
</P>
<P>
But cricket is filled with far better anecdotes, stories that seem to grow more 
bizarre the farther one gets from Lords, the London headquarters of the game. 
</P>
<P>
There is the tale, for example, of the Englishman who tried to get his cricket 
bat through French Customs several years ago. Failing to grasp the visitor's 
explanation of the bat's use, the inspector simply handed him a form listing 
dozens of descriptions and asked him to check the appropriate one. The cricket 
bat eventually entered France as an engine sportif sans movement mecanique. 
</P>
<P>
Or what about this one from Germany, where cricket is played in Munich in the 
Englischer Garten, a public park where, as one writer put it, "the German 
penchant for cavorting about naked prevails." 
</P>
<P>
This habit has necessitated a slight altering of the rules of the game as they 
are observed in Munich: A batsman cannot be dismissed if, in the opinion of the 
umpires, he was hopelessly distracted by an unclad Fraulein jogging in the 
outfield. That, it is felt, just wouldn't be cricket. 
</P>
<P>
Or there is this delightful tale involving C. Aubrey Smith himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dropped Catch 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Smith, the team captain, was fielding in a match in Los Angeles 
one day when he dropped a catch. He immediately stopped the game and called for 
his butler, who was instructed to bring Smith his spectacles. The butler 
returned with the spectacles and the game continued. A few minutes later, Smith 
dropped another catch, and, so the story goes, was heard to curse: "The damn 
fool brought my reading glasses." 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, there is the story of the Rev. Elisha Fawcett, an English cleric who, 
early last century, devoted his life to teaching the natives of the Admiralty 
Islands Christianity and cricket, perhaps not in that order. 
</P>
<P>
The islanders were not wealthy and, when Fawcett died, they cast about for a 
suitable monument to place over his grave. They chose the good clergyman's 
wooden leg. Well, what with a nurturing climate and plenty of rain, the leg 
took root and, in the years ahead, the resultant tree produced a whole harvest 
of new bats for the islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's a cricket story. 
</P>
<P>
Those curious enough to want to see a game in person can best do so by heading 
out to Woodley Park in Van Nuys between now and Oct. 22, when the current 
season ends. 
</P>
<P>
There are three cricket fields there, with matches being played simultaneously 
starting at about 11 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing time for the traditional break for tea, the games can last until dusk. 
If the action seems a bit baffling, ask a player what's going on. You might 
even learn that a duck is zero, and the trip will not have been for nought.

PLANTINGS THRIVE IN WATER-WISE PLOTS

Robert Cornell flinches when he hears the term "water-conserving garden." 
</P>
<P>
"People think it means dry and dreary," or a lot of extra work for the 
homeowner, "but I want to dispel that," he says. "It's not so. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire landscape doesn't have to be (drought tolerant)," he continues, 
"just use water sensibly. That's why I like to call it water wise (instead of 
water conserving); you use it appropriately in a limited area." 
</P>
<P>
Cornell is a member of the state Green Industry Advisory Council on Water 
Issues, president of the L.A./San Gabriel chapter of California Landscape 
Contractors Assn., president of his own landscaping firm. He will speak next 
Saturday at the fifth annual Ecological Landscaping Symposium, sponsored by 
Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in water conservation for 10 years," Cornell says. "It used 
to be very difficult to get (drought-tolerant) plant material, now there's more 
variety and people are more open to the idea, especially after three 
consecutive years of drought. You can have a beautiful and diverse garden and 
still save water." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Styles of Gardens 
</P>
<P>
Cornell is one of six experts in the field who will speak on "Water-Wise 
Gardens, California Style." For his part, he will demonstrate six styles of 
gardens (though there are many more, he says) from an English-cottage style 
(utilizing coral bells, Mexican sage and rock rose) to a seaside style 
(including sea lavender, ice plant and echium), and "only one of the gardens 
centers on cactus," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the symposium, which covers everything from garden design to 
alternative grasses to sophisticated irrigation systems, is to educate the 
public because they are "part of the problem," Cornell says. 
</P>
<P>
"Change is being forced because of the (water crisis) situation," Cornell says. 
But it will "take a change in aesthetics. Nurserymen and landscape contractors 
are still feeling their way. It won't happen overnight, it's a gradual 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Determined to assist in that process is Melanie Baer, manager of the Theodore 
Payne Foundation for Wildflowers and Native Plants in Sun Valley, who will talk 
about utilizing colorful plants that naturally adapt to the state's diverse 
climates and are found right in our own back yards -- the California natives. 
</P>
<P>
"The main point I'd like to get across is how simple it is," Baer says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Micro Climates 
</P>
<P>
One thing a gardener should be familiar with before planting, Baer says, is the 
micro climates in the landscape. Sections of the yard will differ, she says, in 
temperature, soil consistency and amount of moisture. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with natives involves a sensitivity to environmental factors and a 
knowledge of their origins," Baer explains. "With any plant, not just 
California natives, you have to find the right place for the plant. Every time 
you buy a plant you should know this information. If you go home with a fern, 
the nursery person should be able to tell you where the plant came from and how 
to care for it." 
</P>
<P>
In her talk on incorporating California natives into the landscape, Baer will 
offer ideas on colorful natives that require little care. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to demystify native plants," she says. "A lot of us have such busy 
schedules we don't have time to spend in the garden. But if you find the right 
plant for the right place, once you get it in the ground it really requires low 
maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Native Plants 
</P>
<P>
Baer also will suggest some native plants, such as the California lilac. "It's 
a beautiful blue flowering shrub. You see it all over the world," she says, 
but, surprisingly, it hasn't caught on too well with California gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to speak at the symposium: Joe Y.T. Hung, chairman of Cal Poly 
Pomona's Agricultural Engineering Department, who will discuss irrigation 
systems -- "where you can or can't put a drip system, for example," he says; 
Michael MacCaskey, an editor for Sunset magazine, will produce a gardening 
update on water awareness; Ron Pecoff, landscape contractor and horticultural 
consultant to corporations and government agencies, plans to discuss exotic yet 
water-wise designs, and Victor Gibeault, environmental horticulturist at UC 
Riverside and editor of California Turfgrass Culture, will discuss 
state-of-the-art developments in water conserving and low-maintenance grasses. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with all this information, symposium graduates can return to Rancho Santa 
Ana Nov. 4 for the Native Plant Sale, from 8 a.m.-2 p.m. in the garden's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium will be held from 8:30 a.m.-4 p.m. in the Mudd Theater, 
Claremont School of Theology, at Foothill Boulevard and College Avenue, 
Claremont. Registration is $61 (includes box lunch, refreshments, materials and 
parking). Call (714) 625-8767 or (714) 626-1917.

Harcourt Brace to Cut Interest Expense: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich said it will 
reduce its annual cash interest expense by $115 million as a result of the sale 
of its theme parks and land. The Orlando, Fla.-based company said cash flow 
from its publishing and insurance businesses will be "entirely sufficient" to 
pay its cash interest obligations for the foreseeable future. Harcourt Brace's 
sale last week to Anheuser-Busch Cos. included its four Sea World theme parks 
as well as 1,200 acres of undeveloped land.

2 SENATORS UNVEIL BILL TO SPUR AIRLINE COMPETITION

<P>
Deregulation in the airline industry has led to domination of domestic air 
travel by a few companies, two Republican senators said Friday in introducing 
legislation they say would increase competition. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) said deregulation has 
failed to benefit the traveling public, despite an early flurry of competition, 
but that their bill is not a return to regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would instead "address what we consider the most egregious airline 
practices inhibiting competition," McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
"The traveling public is not going to be dangling from the strings of a few 
huge airlines," Danforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Under their proposed legislation: 
</P>
<P>
* Airlines would be barred from owning computerized reservation systems, used 
by 85% of travel agents. The sponsors say the owners require agents to book a 
minimum number of the owners' flights, the system updates the owners' fare and 
seat availability more quickly and other airlines without the systems must pay 
booking fees to use the system. 
</P>
<P>
* Slots, the landing rights at airports currently controlled by the major 
airlines, would be auctioned off, giving preference to new entrants in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
* The Transportation Department would have a stronger say in assuring 
competition by monitoring activity in the industry using standards developed by 
the Justice Department for use in antitrust enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
* The Transportation Department would allow airports to levy per-passenger user 
fees earmarked for expanding airport capacity, improving security or reducing 
the impact of airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
* The Federal Trade Commission would be given authority to police the industry 
for unfair practices. Some of the practices would be predatory pricing; 
overcharging for subleases of terminal space, gates and baggage carousels, and 
use of majority-in-interest clauses in airport leases to restrict expansion. 
</P>
<P>
* Airlines would be forbidden to share booking codes -- the initials for 
airlines. For instance, a flight from Columbia, Mo., to London might have a TWA 
code even though "feeder" lines aren't TWA owned. Each airline would have a 
unique code, Danforth said, which would facilitate competition for bookings 
among regional carriers. 
</P>
<P>
McCain said the market share of the nation's top nine airlines grew to 94% in 
1986 from 78% in 1985.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: ELDERLY SHOULD REVIEW HEALTH-CARE POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING

<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of senior citizens should re-evaluate their health insurance and 
financial plans if Congress, as expected, repeals most or all of the Medicare 
catastrophic health-care program. Some policies may need to be expanded to pick 
up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are a senior -- or if you are a concerned son or daughter trying to 
help your elderly parents -- be wary of premium price hikes, fast-talking sales 
pitches and other hype from insurers trying to capitalize on the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Repeal of catastrophic care -- a response to protests from wealthy seniors 
angry about higher taxes to finance the program -- was approved in the House 
this week while the Senate voted for a stripped-down version that retains 
expanded hospital benefits but eliminates other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves open the possibility again that some severe illnesses or other 
medical calamities could subject you to extreme financial hardship if you do 
not have private "Medigap" insurance or other coverage to supplement Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Repeal of most or all catastrophic care benefitsmeans that enhanced Medigap 
policies may be a requirement for many seniors, consumer advocates say. With 
the catastrophic care program, they had said just the opposite, questioning 
whether the policies would really be needed at all starting next year, when 
catastrophic coverage was scheduled to take full effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Repeal (of catastrophic care) puts pressure on people who don't have Medigap 
policies to reconsider again," says J. Robert Hunter, president of the National 
Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a whole new ball game again regarding Medigap," says James P. Firman, 
president of the United Seniors Health Cooperative, a Washington consumer 
group. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you have Medigap coverage, you may find that your policy must be 
expanded to cover long hospital stays and other items that the catastrophic 
program began to cover this year or would have covered next year. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, some experts say, Medigap insurance providers may hike premiums as 
much as 20% to 30%, on top of similar increases last year that raised annual 
premiums to between $400 and $800, or even higher. And insurance marketers are 
likely to issue a barrage of new pitches to capture sales, including trying to 
get those with existing policies to buy new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Good companies will be conscientious in making sure existing policy holders 
don't suffer too much and that there is a smooth transition," says Robin 
Talbert, senior program specialist in consumer affairs at the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. "But at the same time, some unscrupulous agents or brokers 
will try to make a quick buck off the confusion that will result." 
</P>
<P>
Basic Medigap policies will continue to cover many items not covered by 
Medicare, such as doctor bills and possibly such things as prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But if catastrophic care is repealed completely, as in the House version, 
Medigap plans must be expanded to restore coverage for long-term hospital 
stays. That is because if catastrophic care is repealed in entirety, Medicare 
will likely revert to its old coverage limits that provided for only up to 90 
days of hospitalization with a $540 deductible in 1988. Patients also had to 
make co-payments of $135 per day in 1988 for days 61 through 90. Under that old 
plan, for any stay after 90 days, you were liable. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare catastrophic coverage this year began covering hospitalization costs 
for up to 365 days a year -- subject to one annual deductible of $560 this year 
and $592 next year. Accordingly, Medigap plans this year dropped long-term 
hospitalization coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted to retain this benefit, but if the House version prevails in 
conference committee and long hospital stays are not covered under Medicare, 
some Medigap policies are likely to restore that coverage automatically, 
consumer advocate Hunter says. State insurance regulators may also step in and 
require that all Medigap plans offer full hospitalization coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's extremely important," Hunter says. "This is the one area that can wipe 
you out financially." 
</P>
<P>
But don't panic and rush out and buy the first offer that comes around, 
consumer advocates say. Don't be pressured into a quick decision. Read any 
policy carefully before you buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Wait for the final result from Congress and for objective consumer-oriented 
information about Medigap revisions, such as that likely to be provided in 
Consumer Reports magazine and other journals. 
</P>
<P>
Use free counseling services provided by many states. In California, the 
state-funded Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program provides free 
health insurance counseling and legal assistance in certain circumstances 
involving claims or payments. For information and referrals, call the 
California Insurance Department's consumer hot line at (800) 233-9045. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid buying more than one policy because multiple policies are usually 
duplicative and force you to pay unnecessary extra dollars. 
</P>
<P>
If you are considering changing policies -- perhaps if your old one is hiking 
premiums sky high -- check for pre-existing condition clauses that may limit 
your coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Also, ask if you really need Medigap. If you have retiree group medical 
coverage through your old employer, you probably don't need supplemental 
insurance. Ditto if you are enrolled in a solvent health maintenance 
organization or other prepaid health plan. And it still may make sense for 
people with a lot of money to self insure, Firman says. 
</P>
<P>
And irrespective of your decision on Medigap, consider whether you need 
long-term care insurance to cover nursing home expenses. This was generally not 
covered in the catastrophic plan anyway. More and more long-term care policies 
are becoming available, with better terms and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Also consider meeting with a financial adviser to draw up a financial plan.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TRACKING DOWN AN OLD STOCK INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

QUESTION: I bought 50 shares of General Electric stock through a company 
payroll savings plan in the 1960s. I have absolutely no record of what these 
shares cost. Since then, the stock split three times and those initial shares 
grew to a total of 400. In addition, I purchased 100 more shares through 
General Electric's dividend reinvestment program. I have no record of what 
these shares cost. I sold the 500 shares a few months ago and received $27,000. 
How do I figure my taxable gain? -- W. P. H. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Our tax adviser, Margaret Bumcrot, a certified public accountant in 
Downey, could only shake her head when she heard of your predicament and offer 
a bit of rueful, but nevertheless after-the-fact, counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Bumcrot believes that you could have easily avoided your problems, which, by 
the way, are all too common among taxpayers, with a simple bit of financial 
record-keeping. But all the lectures in the world about your past sins won't 
help you now, although this explanation should help other readers who are 
flirting with similar woes by failing to record stock purchases and dividend 
reinvestments. 
</P>
<P>
What can you do? For starters, Bumcrot recommends that you check with your 
company's payroll office to see if any records of your stock purchases still 
exist. If they do, you would then have to research the stock splits, which are 
chronicled in records kept by brokerage houses and, of course, General 
Electric. (Any correspondence with General Electric should be directed to its 
investor relations office.) 
</P>
<P>
If your company has no record of your stock purchases, you are just going to 
have to make some educated guesses as to when you purchased the stock and then 
determine the per-share price at that time through research materials at a 
brokerage house or through General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
If all this sounds like a lot of work, you're right. But there's no escaping 
it. Your broker is going to report the sale of your 500 shares to the Internal 
Revenue Service, and the IRS is going to expect you to report your $27,000 
proceeds on your tax return. If you can't determine your taxable gain, the IRS 
can demand taxes on the entire $27,000. So it behooves you to determine your 
initial investment in these shares and your true gain. 
</P>
<P>
If your broker can't -- or won't -- help you, and you need professional 
assistance, you can retain a stock-research firm. These companies offer a 
variety of research services involving public companies and their stock. For 
example, they would be able to give you the stock split dates and the market 
value of your stock on any given day in history. Of course, there is a fee. 
</P>
<P>
(These companies will also research whether a company is still in business and 
can provide the forms stating that a particular company has folded. These 
certificates are required by the IRS when taxpayers claim capital stock losses 
when a company goes out of business.) 
</P>
<P>
There are several stock research companies across the nation, but according to 
a recent survey, some of the lowest fees are charged by Prudential-American 
Securities Inc. The company's address is 921 East Green St., Pasadena, Calif. 
91106. By the way, if you choose to use a research service, never send them 
your original stock certificate. A photocopy is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figuring Out the Gain on Selling Gift Stock 
</P>
<P>
Q: I need some further clarification on giving stock as a gift to a minor. In 
1961, I gave my daughter some shares of stock that I had originally purchased 
in 1956. Because the value of the shares exceeded the limit for a tax-free 
gift, we paid a gift tax. My daughter is no longer a minor, and this year she 
sold the shares because the company was acquired. What original value should my 
daughter use when computing her taxable gain -- the original cost of the shares 
in 1956, or their value in 1961 when she received them as a gift? -- K. P. M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Although there are several interesting "twists" to your story, they are 
extraneous to the essential matter: The shares you gave your daughter were a 
gift, and their original tax basis is what you paid for them in 1956. This cost 
was passed on to your daughter as the taxable basis of the shares and should be 
deducted from whatever proceeds she received when she sold the shares. The gift 
tax you paid in 1961, and the fact that the shares were given to a minor, do 
not affect the nature of the transaction or its tax implications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Way to Pass Property to a Child 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a way that my wife and I can give a piece of property to our 
daughter over a number of years without exceeding the gift tax limitation? I 
thought I heard that you could set up a partnership between the parents and 
child, establish an agreed-upon value of the property (say $300,000), and then 
pass a portion of the total -- worth no more than the $20,000 we are allowed to 
give her tax-free each year -- to her every year. What can you tell me about 
this? -- W. K. F. 
</P>
<P>
A: What you've heard is essentially correct, according to our experts. But you 
should understand that this procedure -- using the values you have given us -- 
would take 15 years to complete and is quite complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Further, while the gifts would be tax-free each year to your daughter, in the 
end, she will have received a gift whose tax basis is the price you paid for it 
plus any improvements. So when she goes to sell the property, there could be a 
mighty big capital gain staring her in the face. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, our experts say, your plan requires the assistance of an attorney to 
draw up what is known as a "family partnership." You may also need the services 
of an accountant to keep track of the increments changing hands each year. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a better alternative, say our experts, is an installment sale between 
you and your daughter. She can make a down payment and repay you incrementally 
over the years using the money -- up to $20,000 a year -- that you give to her 
tax free every year. In any event, no matter which course of action you choose, 
you would be wise to consult an attorney, accountant or trusted financial 
planner before taking any action.

RALLY BOOSTS DOW TO FOURTH RECORD IN ROW 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street rallied to a fourth consecutive record close Friday, supported by a 
strong bond market and speculation that the Federal Reserve may ease credit 
after the government reported surprisingly weak September employment. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index rose 11.96 points to close at 2,785.52, a new 
closing high that put the Dow within striking distance of 2,800. 
</P>
<P>
For the week, the 30-share Dow gained 92.70 points, the largest weekly gain 
since June 3, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines with 780 up, 667 down and 520 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the action at the opening was a response to the employment, which was 
favorable for the bond market and to interest rates in general. Stocks firmed 
on that," said Lewis Smith, a technical analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 172.52 million shares, against 
177.89 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in 
NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and 
in the over-the-counter market, totaled 209 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Before the opening, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate 
rose one-tenth of a percentage point in September to 5.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders interpreted the report as a fresh signal that the economy 
was making only sluggish progress. The inference from that, brokers said, was 
that chances were improving for a further easing of the Federal Reserve's 
credit policy sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
The report sent interest rates lower in the credit markets. Rates on short-term 
Treasury bills fell about 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
USX led the active list, up 1/8 at 38 1/2. Late Thursday, Carl C. Icahn 
disclosed that he had raised his stake in USX, confirming recent rumors that he 
was intensifying pressure on the company. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, index-linked trust funds and other investors caught interest-rate 
jitters after European interest rate rises on Thursday failed to beat the 
dollar down. In the face of heavy selling, prices slumped in moderate trading. 
The Nikkei 225-share average sank 313.64 points to close at 35,209.35. 
</P>
<P>
Shares ended slightly lower on London's Stock Exchange, but well above their 
session lows. The Financial Times 100-share index ended 4.1 points lower at 
2,277.5. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices soared on expectations that the Federal Reserve might soon lower 
interest rates following the release of the unemployment report for September. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 21/32 point, or about $6.56 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 
8.01% from 8.07% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs report could encourage the Federal Reserve to ease interests rates in 
the near term to reinvigorate the economy. But on Friday the central bank's 
action in draining some bank reserves was perceived as a signal that Fed policy 
had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.813%, down from 9% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed in U.S. trading after marching higher overseas as 
investors remained bullish about the U.S. currency despite ongoing efforts by 
central banks to squelch demand. 
</P>
<P>
Gold finished higher in New York after falling in Europe and Asia. Republic 
National Bank of New York said gold was bid late in the day at $363.25 an 
ounce, up from $363.10 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar traders mostly ignored efforts by central banks from the United States, 
West Germany and Japan to push the currency lower, raising more questions about 
the Group of Seven industrial nations' attempts to stabilize world currency 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Central banks don't seem to know what they want," said Lawrence A. Veit, 
international economist with Brown Bros., Harriman &amp; Co. "Unless the 
central banks show a sign of getting their act together we will see a stronger 
dollar." 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.8880 West German marks, up from 1.8845 
marks Thursday. In late New York trading, the dollar climbed to 1.8885 marks, 
from 1.8848 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose 1.40 yen to 142.45 yen in Tokyo and changed hands at 142.50 yen 
in London, up from 142.30. In New York, meanwhile, the U.S. currency dipped to 
142.35 yen from 142.55 yen a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In London trading, the British pound rose to $1.6030, from $1.6100 late 
Thursday. But in New York, the pound fell to $1.6055 from $1.6115 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures prices sank for a fourth straight day, hitting 14-year lows 
after a meeting of the world's biggest coffee producers and consumers ended 
with no price-support agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to keep the door open for negotiations and that's it," said Kim 
Badenhop, a market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, corn and soybeans slumped while livestock, precious 
metals and energy futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures finished 2.5 to 2.79 cents lower, with December at 70.39 cents a 
pound, the market's lowest settlement since the summer of 1975.

SMOKING BLAMED IN FIRE THAT KILLED 9

Careless smoking caused a fire that killed nine elderly people and injured 98 
others Thursday night at the Hillhaven Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center, 
local fire investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Thomas E. Gardner said more lives could have been saved if the 
nursing home had installed a sprinkler system, but he added that state fire 
laws do not require them in older buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of (the residents) might not have died if there were sprinklers . . . I 
think they should be mandatory in all buildings," Gardner said. "If I were in 
control, you couldn't build a doghouse without a sprinkler system." He called 
on state legislators to require older nursing homes to be retrofitted with 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials said the 21-year-old nursing home, which had 161 
residents, had undergone recent inspections and was in compliance with state 
fire codes. The uniform state building code, adopted in 1973, requires 
sprinklers in nursing homes, but the code was not applied retroactively to 
homes such as Hillhaven. 
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly in 1987 allowed localities to require sprinklers in 
buildings at least five stories or 50 feet high, according to fire officials. 
The brick Hillhaven nursing home has four stories. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Hillhaven Corp., which operates 360 nursing homes across the 
country, said the home was up to code and was well-equipped to deal with fires. 
The facility has fire alarms, smoke detectors in the halls and fire doors, 
according to spokeswoman Mary Stancill. She said the company will consider 
installing a sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 141 people, including firefighters and neighbors, were taken to 
eight area hospitals and six nursing homes Thursday night. Of those, 98 
received significant injuries. Most were treated for smoke inhalation.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE CALLS FOR BETTER AIDS TRAINING IN NURSING SCHOOLS 
</P>

<P>
A national conference that drew together a broad cross section of the nursing 
profession called this week for major changes in the way nurses approach AIDS, 
including development of a model AIDS curriculum for every nursing school in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no real standard yet for what nurses need to know about AIDS 
infection," said Kristine Gebbie, secretary of health for the state of 
Washington and chairwoman of the federally sponsored conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to see faculty beefed up and the content laid out so that we can say 
every nurse in this country is prepared," Gebbie said. 
</P>
<P>
The 95 participants at Wednesday's meeting represented key nursing 
organizations from across the country. They were asked by the U.S. Public 
Health Service to develop a national strategy for nurses to deal with the AIDS 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Their recommendations do not have the force of law. Nevertheless, workshop 
participants -- including representatives of the American Nurses Assn., the 
major professional organization for registered nurses, and the National League 
for Nursing, which accredits nursing schools -- are expected to wield 
considerable influence. 
</P>
<P>
"This report will go out to the profession as a whole," said Gebbie, a nurse 
who served on former President Ronald Reagan's AIDS panel. "We want to mobilize 
the profession. We expect everyone to go back to their boards with it." 
</P>
<P>
She said it is essential that nursing schools establish a model curriculum for 
AIDS, such as those established for other diseases and conditions. "For 
example, there is a standard set of stuff about newborn babies that every 
school in the country teaches," Gebbie said. "You can't graduate from any 
nursing school without learning this material. But there is no similar standard 
for what nurses need to know about HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) 
infection." 
</P>
<P>
Large cities that are centers of the epidemic already have developed such 
curricula in many of their schools, she said. But, "if you enrolled in a school 
of nursing in the middle of the country, where (AIDS) cases are lower, you 
might never see an AIDS-infected patient while you were a student and you might 
not have a faculty member who had ever cared for a patient with AIDS or HIV 
infection." 
</P>
<P>
Workshop participants recommended that nurses be included in AIDS policy-making 
at all levels, from hospitals to city, state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
"Nurses have been at the heart of the response to this epidemic," Gebbie said. 
"This is a disease that demands intensive nursing response. Also, nurses are 
out in the community where prevention happens. They are often turned to with 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
The report also urges that nurses be trained to "take AIDS risk into 
consideration when evaluating their patients," even those they treat for 
conditions unrelated to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"That means every nurse has to learn and understand how to talk about sexual 
activity and not be afraid to explore issues of drug abuse and homosexuality," 
Gebbie said. 
</P>
<P>
"For many of us in nursing school, if we spent five minutes on human sexuality, 
it was like getting an extracurricular course. It just wasn't talked about," 
she said. "We need to teach nurses about that. We have to become accustomed to 
treating patients who live in non-traditional families." 
</P>
<P>
In that context, nurses also must know how and where to refer patients at risk 
for HIV for counseling, testing and other AIDS services, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the group recommended that more comprehensive research be conducted 
into how to care for patients who suffer from the range of ailments associated 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Nurses know a lot about how to care for someone with weight loss, or someone 
with severe diarrhea, or someone who has a body image disturbance, but not a 
case where you have all systems failing at once," Gebbie said. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting's end, Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health, 
honored 10 nurses, including one from Los Angeles, for their work with AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who received the Public Health Service award for "selfless 
dedication, compassionate service and outstanding leadership in providing 
nursing care" to people with AIDS was Erna Ferraro, a patient case manager with 
the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.

SOCIAL PROGRAMS ARE FACTORS IN STATES' FALLING REVENUES, SURVEY SHOWS

State governments facing current or potential declines in revenues are being 
asked by Congress to spend billions on social programs and will have to dip 
into their reserves, cut other spending and raise taxes, state officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In their annual fiscal survey of the states, the National Governors' Assn. and 
the National Assn. of State Budget Officers said many Northeastern states ended 
fiscal 1989 with balances smaller than they enjoyed at the end of the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Many other states closed out the year with ending balances higher than before 
because they had anticipated economic slowdowns that did not occur, the two 
organizations of state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, their report said, the states of the populous Northeast are often 
a harbinger of things to come in the economy as a whole and "the rapid decline 
in revenues in these states could portend downturns in other states." 
</P>
<P>
Raymond G. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' association, said 
that "early indications are that a number of states (in the Northeast) are not 
seeing any revenue growth at all in the first three months" of fiscal year 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The fiscal year ends on June 30 in 46 states, on March 31 in New York, on Aug. 
31 in Texas and on Sept. 30 in Michigan and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Scheppach said programs for catastrophic medical care will cost states an 
estimated $4.2 billion over the next four years, despite repeal and cutback 
measures currently being considered in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
He said changes in nursing home laws enacted in 1987 will cost states an 
estimated $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If Medicaid revisions being considered become law, states will have to find an 
additional $11.2 billion to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Congress) still want to do a lot of things and they don't have any money 
and we are probably the easiest place to shift it to," Scheppach told 
reporters.

PERU'S PRESIDENT ASKS U.S. FOR BILLIONS TO END PEASANTS' COCA GROWING

<P>
President Alan Garcia on Friday called on the United States to funnel billions 
of dollars to Peruvian peasants to encourage them to replace coca, the raw 
material for cocaine, with other crops as a way of curbing the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
Saying Washington's anti-drug efforts were misguided, Garcia said the United 
States should invest in Peruvian agriculture and give seeds and fertilizers to 
induce farmers to switch from coca to coffee and other crops. 
</P>
<P>
"I propose the U.S. form a direct alliance with peasants . . . who will be the 
most active fighters against drug trafficking if you give them an alternative," 
Garcia said in an interview with Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Peru could slash the amount of coca smuggled out of the country if 
the U.S. gave Peru a radar network along its jungle border with Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Peru is the world's largest producer of coca, the raw material for over 60% of 
the cocaine that reaches U.S. streets. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said Washington should also guarantee a share of the U.S. market for 
coca growers who switch to coffee or cocoa, the raw material for chocolate, and 
perhaps even pay to airlift their crops out of farming regions in the same way 
that drug traffickers airlift cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"No product will be able to compete with cocaine as long as cocaine is shipped 
out by plane," said Garcia who, at 40, is Latin America's youngest president. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia has allowed U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents to aid local 
police in wrecking cocaine laboratories, jungle airstrips and hideouts used by 
traffickers in Peru's Upper Huallaga river valley, the world's largest coca 
supply point. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents and local police have destroyed at least 10 cocaine laboratories in 
the Upper Huallaga valley in the past month, government officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
But Garcia said he believed military and police aid would not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The most direct and real way of attacking the problem . . . of Latin American 
(coca) production is not through weapons and helicopters," said Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has earmarked $261 million as the first part of a long-term 
anti-drug aid program.

SANTA ANA, LAGUNA FREEWAYS LINK TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans' forecast for Monday traffic out on the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine: 
Bad to worse, with apologies. 
</P>
<P>
The northbound Santa Ana Freeway connector to the southbound Laguna Freeway in 
Irvine will be permanently closed by Caltrans at 7 a.m. Monday for bridge work. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Transportation engineer Hillary McMahon said the closure is 
necessary in order to widen the freeway from three regular, mixed-flow lanes at 
that location to four such lanes plus a car-pool lane on the northbound side of 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has suggested using the Alton Parkway exit from the Santa Ana Freeway 
and Sand Canyon Avenue to leave the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltrans regrets any inconvenience this might present," the agency said 
Friday. But the work under way is intended to "increase efficiency and better 
accommodate traffic volume."

KARATE TEACHER EXPECTED TO FACE MOLESTATION CHARGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Dana Point karate instructor has been arrested on suspicion of sexually 
molesting two of his young male students, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said Alfonceo Vito Gaunchii, 44, was 
arrested Thursday afternoon at his residence in the 24000 block of Sherwood 
Way, where he teaches about 40 karate students in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said Gaunchii is expected to face charges of one count of oral copulation 
and three counts of child molestation. All involve incidents that allegedly 
took place at Gaunchii's home, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The two alleged victims are 12-year-old and 14-year-old boys, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began after members of the sheriff's sex crimes unit learned 
about allegations involving the 14-year-old. That led to a court-approved 
warrant to search Gaunchii's house on Wednesday. Investigators say they found 
some evidence at the home to corroborate information from the 14-year-old, but 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was during this investigation that they learned about the 
12-year-old, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaunchii was arrested Thursday afternoon without incident at his home, where 
two other youngsters were present for a karate class.

2 ARRESTED IN ATTEMPTED MURDER OF ORANGE WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Buena Park man and his girlfriend have been arrested in connection with the 
attempted murder and attempted rape of a 26-year-old Orange woman, the Buena 
Park Police Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Richard McMillen said the victim had car trouble while driving in 
Garden Grove about 4 p.m. Thursday. McMillen said a man approached the woman 
and offered to help. She rode with him in his car to his residence in the 5700 
block of Fullerton Avenue in Buena Park, and the man tried to rape her inside 
the house, McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
"When she fought back, (the assailant) stabbed, cut and hit her several times," 
McMillen said. McMillen said the man u used a knife, which she was able to turn 
on him during the struggle. McMillen said the assailant's girlfriend was in the 
house at the time, and she is considered an accessory to the attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
The victim managed to flee when the couple put her in a car, saying they were 
taking her back to Garden Grove, McMillen said. He said the woman jumped out 
and ran to a fast-food outlet, where an employee called police. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said the couple were arrested at 7:20 p.m. at their Buena Park 
residence. Daniel L. Hoznor, 24, was booked on suspicion of attempted rape and 
attempted murder, and Constance E. Bloom, 22, identified as his girlfriend, was 
booked on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hoznor was taken to the jail ward of United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana 
"with deep cuts on both hands," McMillen said. He said the woman victim was 
admitted to UC Irvine Medical Center for treatment of stab wounds.

IT'S IN REPLY TO HIS 'DEAR MIKE' LETTER; 
</P>
<P>
VAN DE KAMP GETS 'DEAR JOHN' LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp apparently knows that Dana Point City Councilman 
Mike Eggers is a magnetic figure in South Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent "Dear Mike" letter to Eggers, Van de Kamp sought to enlist him in 
his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor. "You and I have worked 
together for years within the Democratic Party to advance our common agenda. . 
. . " Van de Kamp wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Oops! 
</P>
<P>
Eggers, a lifelong Republican, is also the full-time district aide of 
Republican U.S. Rep. Ron Packard, who represents South Orange County and North 
San Diego County in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers said on Friday that he guffawed over Van de Kamp's letter, then 
dispatched a reply. Eggers' tongue-in-cheek response said, "I never realized 
that I have worked so closely with you or the Democratic Party or that we 
shared a common agenda, especially in light of the fact that I've never met 
you. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's campaign headquarters in Los Angeles acknowledged that it had 
goofed with the letter to Eggers. "We were seeking endorsements around the 
state, and when you do a mailing like that, things like this happen," said 
Jonas Hanelin, a Van de Kamp campaign aide. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Eggers said that Van de Kamp's polls show him leading Pete Wilson 
among voters likely to turn out next year in the gubernatorial election. 
Wilson, a Republican from San Diego and a U.S. senator, is the odds-on favorite 
to win the GOP nomination for governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's letter to Eggers continued: "More and more people agree that I 
can beat Pete Wilson and become our state's next governor. I'm writing to ask 
you to join them by endorsing my candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
Eggers' response, in effect, told Van de Kamp not to hold his breath. Eggers' 
letter noted that Packard and Wilson have been good friends "for many, many 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Eggers' letter added: "All this brings to mind that classic line from the movie 
'Cool Hand Luke' when the warden said, 'What we have here is a failure to 
communicate.' I can only assume that is the case, although I'm sure some 
computer list or, worse yet, inexperienced campaign volunteer will be blamed 
for all this. 
</P>
<P>
"With that in mind, John, I am returning your campaign endorsement card 
unsigned. As you might expect, a campaign donation check is not in the mail."

Most recently, the NCAA's Presidents' Commission recommended, among other 
things, that schools be forced to disclose graduation rates of their 
scholarship athletes. At first look, a noble gesture. 
</P>
<P>
But I don't suppose the Commission's actions had anything to do with a recent 
government survey showing that from 1982 through '87, 35 of 97 Division I 
institutions graduated only 20% of their basketball players? Or that two 
legislators, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-New Jersey) and Tom McMillen (D-Maryland), 
who somehow managed to play college basketball, earn degrees, become Rhodes 
Scholars and have professional playing careers, are sponsoring a mandatory 
disclosure bill that would require federally funded schools to report the 
graduation rates of their athletes to the U.S. Department of Education and also 
to the scholarship recipients themselves? In short, the NCAA's worst nightmare: 
an honest-to-goodness, suffer-the-consequences-if-you-don't-comply law. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is, the NCAA would rather see Jerry Tarkanian, its arch-enemy from Nevada 
Las Vegas, be named executive director than see the federal government become 
involved in its affairs. The NCAA fears government intervention like Zsa Zsa 
fears motorcycle cops. And with good reason: the government can order it to do 
things it doesn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
This simple fact partly explains the Commission's recent policy proposal, which 
will be introduced at the NCAA convention in January. As it stands now, NCAA 
doctrine calls for disclosure of total graduation rates for Division I 
scholarship athletes, which is fine if you want a muddled and misleading 
representation of academic standing. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley and McMillen's plan, as well as -- surprise! -- this similar 
proposal by the Commission, NCAA member schools would have to reveal how many 
athletes ever march to the tune of "Pomp and Circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a wild guess: graduation rates for football and basketball, which happen 
to be the two main revenue-producing sports at most schools, will be 
disturbingly poor. And here's an unlikely hope: offending athletic programs 
will try everything in their power to markedly improve the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Fullerton, Athletic Director Ed Carroll said he is doing his part. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as making the graduation rates public, we are completely supportive of 
that," he said. "Since a year ago, we've put out that data. I think it's a good 
move. I think it will put the pressure on all the institutions to get their 
graduation rates up." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll would know. He had to explain the miserable graduation numbers of past 
Titan men's basketball teams, especially those of former coach George McQuarn. 
Even worse were the graduation rates of past Fullerton baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Those days are over, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"The key benefit (of the disclosure rule) is the public pressure that would be 
created on an institution," he said. "A number of schools are certainly going 
to be embarrassed. We were embarrassed. Now we're trying to make it better. 
We've made a strong stand." 
</P>
<P>
But will simple disclosure of such numbers prompt a school to make meaningful 
adjustments and improvements? And do you honestly think that a top recruit will 
turn down Basketball U., factory to the National Basketball Assn., because its 
graduation rates were on the low side? Or that given the choice between a 
national championship and a high graduation rate, fans and financial supporters 
of a school will choose an increase in diplomas? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will affect a group of parents and student-athletes who are into 
academics," said Mike Bokosky, assistant basketball coach at UC Irvine. "I 
don't think it will affect schools with a terrible graduation rate. Players 
will go there because they know it's easier. Prestige-wise, it might hurt 
(schools) when their college president is sitting around with another college 
president. But I don't think it will hurt the recruiting, even if the 
graduation rate is poor." 
</P>
<P>
This is sad -- but not altogether surprising -- news. In fact, if anyone should 
know about the inequities of the current system, it is Bokosky, who does a lot 
of the recruiting for Irvine. Bookworms want to know graduation rates. 
Basketball players want to know if they'll start. 
</P>
<P>
Still, every time Bokosky enters a recruit's home, he has in his briefcase an 
updated list of graduation rates for Irvine basketball players. In the 10 
seasons that Bokosky and Coach Bill Mulligan have been at Irvine, 24 of the 31 
seniors have earned degrees. Three more seniors will graduate this year. 
</P>
<P>
The rates are based on a five-year plan, which is the length of allowed 
eligibility (with a redshirt season). 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, a lot of schools come in and say, 'We graduate 78%,' but they don't 
put it on paper," Bokosky said. 
</P>
<P>
Not so if the Commission or Bradley and McMillen have their way. At last, every 
recruit, every faculty member, every booster with a conscience, every 
conference president and every newspaper will have access to reliable and 
accurate graduation numbers. Even if it improves the graduation rate by a 
measly 1% then it was worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea," said Bokosky. 
</P>
<P>
So do we. But why did it take so long? And why did it take two congressmen with 
jump shots, not the NCAA, to care first?

Edison High School tailback Shane Sherman can give you 1,091 reasons why he 
shattered a school rushing record Friday night that had stood for nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The five starters on Edison's offensive line average 200 pounds per man, and 
behind their 1,091 pounds of bulk, Sherman carried 31 times for 307 yards -- 
the seventh-highest rushing total in Orange County history. Edison easily 
defeated host St. John Bosco, 48-27. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely overwhelmed," said Sherman, who shattered the mark of 238 
yards, which was set by Kerwin Bell in 1979 against Pius X. 
</P>
<P>
"But the credit goes to the blockers. Everyone -- the line and the receivers -- 
blocked great." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman sat out the fourth quarter of the game, after Edison had the victory 
wrapped up. He had gained 185 yards in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman scored four touchdowns on runs of one, six, and 53 yards. And he scored 
on a 12-yard pass from quarterback Donnie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman's longest runs were of 53 and 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (3-2) begins league play next week against Huntington Beach (4-1) at 
Orange Coast College. STUART MATTHEWS

EL TORO SLUGGISH IN VICTORY OVER ANTELOPE VALLEY, 19-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Johnson, El Toro High School coach, said it was just a case of being "a 
little out of sync." Perhaps, but overconfidence might have been the real 
reason that the Chargers, ranked No. 2 in Orange County, struggled much of the 
time Friday night in a 19-0 nonleague victory over Antelope Valley before 2,200 
at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
That the Antelopes are the defending Southern Section Division II champions and 
a perennial Southern California prep football power seemed to escape El Toro. 
All the Chargers (5-0) seemed cognizant of was Antelope Valley's 
uncharacteristic losing streak, which now stands at four games. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Johnson pointed out after the game, the three prior losses also 
were to quality opponents, including last week to Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sluggish, but we'll take a 19-0 win anytime," Johnson said. 
"Especially over a team like Antelope Valley (1-4). They take a back seat to 
nobody, they play good people, and they are a big-time program." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro made it 19-0 with 5:59 left when Steve Stenstrom, who completed 13 of 
21 passes for 212 yards, threw a 47-yard pass to Rob Johnson, who had nine 
catches for 154 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes had three scoring opportunities, but wasted them all. In the 
second quarter, a bad snap deprived Peter Holt of the chance of even trying a 
47-yard field goal. Holt recovered back at the Antelope Valley 39 yard-line, a 
loss of 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On its first possession of the third quarter, Antelope Valley drove from its 22 
to the El Toro 13, when the drive stalled. Holt tried a 30-yard field goal, but 
El Toro's Brian Haas blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the fourth quarter, the Antelopes drove to the Charger 13 again. 
But on first down, Freddy Edwards fumbled and El Toro recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took advantage of the turnover. Danny Maestas, who had 109 yards 
in only eight carries, gained 46 of them on the next play, setting up Brad 
Hulse's second field goal, a 34-yard kick, which made it 13-0 with 7:37 left.

CORONA DEL MAR ROCKS, ROLLS COSTA MESA, 33-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Corona del Mar High School's football team trotted through a gauntlet of 
cheerleaders and song girls while Queen's "We Will Rock You" blasted over the 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
And rock they did. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar rolled over winless Costa Mesa, 33-13, improving its record to 
4-1. But Sea King Coach Dave Holland said he still is not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were kind of out of sync offensively," he said. "We weren't real 
intense. We made some mental errors but we were OK in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first half, the Sea Kings had built a 12-0 lead, scoring on 
each of their first two possessions. With 5:39 left in the quarter, sophomore 
quarterback Todd Kehrli threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver 
Weston Johnson and senior wide receiver Jerrott Willard opened the second 
quarter with a 28-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:21 left in the half, Kehrli marched the Sea Kings to the half-yard line 
but the Mustangs stopped them with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Although Corona del Mar began the third quarter with two consecutive penalties, 
the team ended it with three touchdowns. On second and 28, Kehrli hit tight end 
Jeff Jackson with an 11-yard pass, then threw a 70-yarder to Weston Johnson for 
the score. Costa Mesa incurred two consecutive penalties on the Sea Kings' next 
possession, moving the ball to the 1, where senior running back Brian Lucas 
barrelled through. Then with 2:12 left in the quarter, Lucas took the ball 
again and swept to the left for a 26-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas finished with 115 yards in 17 carries and two touchdowns, Kehrli 
completed six of 13 passes for 138 passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mustangs were not finished. Senior running back Tony Hoover wriggled 
over the line to put Costa Mesa on the scoreboard with 8:58 left. Less than 
three minutes later, Sea King Jason Hughes fumbled on the 13-yard line, and 
Mustang running back Fernando Ospina recovered. After being sacked for the 
eighth time, quarterback Duby Ospina threw an 18-yard pass. Mustang David 
Phillips and Sea King Weston Johnson struggled for it in the end zone, and 
Phillips emerged victorious.

With the help of a team meeting, Foothill High School came back from a 17-point 
halftime deficit to defeat Irvine High School, 21-17, Friday night at Tustin 
High. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to this win was an incredible halftime speech," Foothill Coach Marty 
McWhinney said. "And it wasn't by (the coaching staff). The kids asked us to 
leave and I don't know what went on in there." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback John Shanahan said, "Our team had been playing lethargic so we 
(Shanahan and co-captains Jamal Duff and Jason Hairston) knew we had to do 
something. We told the team we had to win this for us and no one else. It was 
incredibly inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights came back strong in the second half, with Sean Saunders gaining 123 
of his 135 yards rushing in the second half. Three minutes into the third 
quarter, Shanahan scored on a one-yard run and Kent Donnelly kicked the extra 
point to pull Foothill (2-3) within 17-7. Later in the quarter, Jamal Duff 
caught a 33-yard touchdown pass from Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
With one minute remaining, Shanahan ran for another one-yard touchdown, with 
Donnelly's kick completing the play. 
</P>
<P>
For Irvine (2-3), Shad Vickers ran for a one-yard touchdown, Mark Huffman 
kicked three field goals and Brandon Krabbe intercepted two passes. PAM CEREN

Quarterback Ryan Lewis threw two touchdown passes and kicked a field goal, but 
it wasn't enough as Sonora High School lost to host Gahr, 34-16, Friday night 
in Hanford Rants Stadium in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Gahr's Al McGuire returned the opening kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown and 
later scored on a 50-yard run with a fumble recovery as Gahr won its first 
homecoming game in six years. 
</P>

Sonora was playing without four starters who were suspended earlier in the week 
by Principal Ken Stitcher for their role in a bench-clearing brawl last week

Quarterback Chad Drown recovered from a rough start to lead La Mirada High 
School to a 38-21 come-from-behind victory over Katella in a nonleague football 
game Friday at La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
Drown missed on his first six passes as his team fell behind, 14-3. He 
completed 10 of his final 13 passes -- including two touchdowns to Eric 
DeLaCruz -- for La Mirada (4-1). Katella is 2-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Drown's passing was complemented by running back Joe Fernandez, who gained 198 
yards in 24 carries, including touchdown runs of 15 and four yards. 
</P>
<P>
After two short touchdown runs by Katella quarterback Dennis Briggs gave the 
Knights a second-quarter lead, La Mirada scored twice in the final 2 1/2 
minutes to take a 17-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez cut the deficit to 14-10 on a 15-yard touchdown run with 2:28 left. 
Moments later, the Matadors' Jeff Potter recovered a Katella fumble at the 
losers' 36-yard line.

Drown hit DeLaCruz with a 15-yard touchdown pass with 22 seconds left. RICH

Newport Harbor High School marched 80 yards for a touchdown the first time it 
got the ball en route to a 17-7 victory over Long Beach Wilson Friday night at 
Davidson Field. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Todd Farley capped off the 10-play drive with a 12-yard dash 
around left end. 
</P>
<P>
Sailor quarterback Stephen Scheck picked apart the Wilson secondary on the 
opening drive, connecting on three of his first four passes. He finished the 
night completing 16 of 31 for 169 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Scheck kept rolling out of the pocket to avoid the charging Wilson defense and 
he completed short passes to six receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a pretty good package for blitz control," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff 
Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Matt White caught five passes for 51 yards and set up Newport Harbor's second 
touchdown of the night, catching a 19-yard pass from Scheck with 1:31 to play 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Scheck did the rest, sneaking over from the one-yard line. Josh Klein kicked a 
31-yard field goal in the first quarter and Newport Harbor held a 17-0 lead at 
the half. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

TITANS TRY TO KEEP ROLLING ON ROAD;

FULLERTON, UNBEATEN IN BIG WEST, FACES WINLESS UTAH STATE

LOGAN, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leaves are just past their colorful peak in the Cache Valley, an event many 
locals hope marks the changing of the football season at Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State has finished a nonconference schedule that included USC and 
Illinois, classic mismatches in the Big West Conference play-for-pay style. And 
after four games, all losses, the Aggies have a set of the scariest statistics 
this side of the last day of October. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State is last in the Big West in six of nine statistical categories, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scoring offense, averaging eight points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scoring defense, allowing an average of 47 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Total defense, giving up 588 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
There, but for the grace of Athletic Director Ed Carroll and the unavailability 
of a game in the big-time, might go Cal State Fullerton. But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton enters its game against the Aggies at noon today in Romney Stadium on 
an offensive roll after scoring a total of 75 points in its past two games. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is 2-2-1 overall, but after a 34-20 defeat of Nevada Las Vegas last 
week, the Titans are 1-0 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
And this is one of those games that have come to be known, in the Gene Murphy 
phrase book, as the biggest game of the season this week. In other words, the 
one at hand. The Titans need to win to stay in position to challenge Fresno 
State and San Jose State in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who (this week's opponent is), we've got to be 2-0," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those games against the likes of USC and Illinois do bad things to a team's 
statistics. They also render game film nearly worthless for scouting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're hard to judge, just like we would be after games like that," Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For Utah State, this game is an opportunity -- at least in comparison to the 
games against USC (66-10) and Illinois (41-2). Even Utah defeated the Aggies 
easily, 45-10. Utah State's other loss was to Brigham Young, 37-10. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that we're away from that schedule," Utah State Coach Chuck 
Shelton said. "The bad news is we haven't beaten Fullerton in (six) years." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has received outstanding performances from quarterback Dan Speltz the 
past two weeks, as well as the type of game that has come to be standard from 
running back Mike Pringle, who will be trying for his fifth 100-yard game in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State has struggled, but nowhere more than at quarterback, where sophomore 
Kirk Johnson will start. Johnson started the first two games and then Shelton 
tried Kevin White, another sophomore. But White was injured against Illinois 
and remains out of action, leaving Johnson, who has thrown five interceptions 
and completed 25 of 77 passes for 314 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He has good athletic talent, but you have to mesh that talent with quarterback 
qualities," Shelton said. "If he does that, we'll be a better than average 
offense. We're never gonna be great." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Phil Nevin, Cal State Fullerton's freshman kicker and punter, suffers from 
asthma. He said the condition has caused him problems in baseball in the past, 
but not in football, although he and Coach Gene Murphy are concerned about the 
effect of the altitude in Logan. . . . The altitude has its positive effect as 
well. Nevin tried two 60-yard field goals Friday, hitting the upright on the 
first and putting the ball through on the second. Is he eager to try one in a 
game? "Definitely," Nevin said. Murphy said he would like to give him the 
opportunity, depending upon the score and how well the Fullerton defense is 
playing. . . . Starting offensive lineman Tom Gang, bothered by a knee injury, 
has had limited practice time this week. Murphy said he will start.

SHAWN MORAN'S JOURNEY HOME HAS BEEN ROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shawn Moran, a speedway motorcycle racer from Huntington Beach, hopes he's more 
successful tonight on the 190-yard oval at the Orange County Fairgrounds than 
he was traveling from London to Southern California to participate in the U.S. 
Speedway championship. 
</P>
<P>
Moran was unsuccessful in reserving a nonstop flight from London's Heathrow 
Airport to Los Angeles after a race at Cradley Heath and opted for a layover in 
New York on Monday morning instead. 
</P>
<P>
But his flight from New York was canceled after a two-hour delay on the runaway 
when the plane encountered fuel problems. Moran and Ronnie Correy, who also is 
scheduled to ride at 8 tonight, were bumped on another flight from New York and 
had to accept a flight to St. Louis before arriving in Los Angeles nearly 24 
hours after departing from London. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little tired," Moran said. "Normally we don't have problems coming home 
to race, but you never know." 
</P>
<P>
Moran's travel delay was typical of his 10th season of racing in the British 
Speedway League. Earlier this year, he was banned from all world championship 
events by the governing Federation of International Motorcyclists after testing 
positive for alcohol during a qualifying race for the world long track 
championship in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling meant that Moran, one of the top five riders in the world, was not 
allowed to compete in the long track world final, team cup and pairs 
championships. Saturday, Moran earned a measure of success in an otherwise 
disappointing season when he became the first U.S. rider to win the British 
League Riders' Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The race pits the top scoring rider from each team in the league, with 16 
riders competing in five scratch races. That format will be used tonight at the 
Orange County Fairgrounds to determine the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
In the British championship, Moran was tied with Hans Nielsen after four rounds 
of racing and they met in the final heat of the meeting. Nielsen drew the pole 
position, with Moran starting on the outside and two riders sandwiched between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Moran guessed correctly that Nielsen, the newly crowned world champion, would 
drift outside to a layer of dirt through the first turn, and he slipped 
underneath Nielsen to gain the victory in the four-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my world championship," Moran said. "The race is more difficult to win 
than the world championship. You generally have a couple of riders in the world 
championship from Eastern Bloc countries who would never qualify for this race. 
It was great winning on my home track." 
</P>
<P>
Moran has ridden only once at Costa Mesa. He said adjusting to the fairgrounds' 
smaller track won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about a distance of maybe 30 yards from the starting gate 
through the first turn at Costa Mesa, while we have about 80 yards on the 
tracks in England," Moran said. "The starts are so important here." 
</P>
<P>
Moran adjusted just fine in 1982, when he won the U.S. Championship after 
spending the season in Europe. But he was a champion in absentia, opting to 
return to Europe. If Moran wins tonight, will he decide to stay home and race 
in Southern California next year? 
</P>
<P>
"I've given that a lot of thought," he said. "Initially I thought about riding 
here next year. I've spent 10 years in England . . . that's a long time to be 
away from home. But I've decided to go back next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going all out to win here, I'm going to do my very best. I'm not just 
showing up to get some more Mexican food and then go back to England." 
</P>
<P>
Speedway Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the 21st season of racing at the Orange County Fairgrounds, total attendance 
for 27 weeks was 104,477. The average attendance was 3,869. . . . The leading 
scratch riders for the season at Costa Mesa were Mike Faria, Billy Hamill and 
Alan Christian, all with five victories. Bobby Schwartz, the top qualifier for 
the championship with 107 points at five tracks, won only two scratch mains. . 
. . The prospects of Steve Lucero repeating as champion are slim. Only two 
riders -- Bruce Penhall and Kelly Moran -- have repeated in the 1980s.

HYUNDAI RECALLING '86 EXCELS TO TUNE SMOG SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hyundai Motor American, fearing that some of the 1986 Excel models it sold in 
California will not pass the state's tough emissions test, announced Friday 
that it will retune the emissions systems on up to 28,450 cars at no charge to 
the owners. 
</P>
<P>
The recall campaign affects only vehicles registered and sold in California, 
the Garden Grove-based company said. The voluntary action came after the 
California Air Resources Board notified the company that the model exceeded 
emissions standards in routine testing. 
</P>
<P>
All owners of 1986 Excels sold in California will be notified of the voluntary 
campaign by letter, and Hyundai will be urging original buyers who have sold 
their cars to furnish the name and address of the new owners so the company can 
reach them. 
</P>
<P>
Without the free service, Hyundai officials said, affected vehicles may be more 
likely to fail the emissions tests that California requires every two years. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign involves installation of a choke system shim and a new air 
correction jet in the carburetor and cleaning of the sub-exhaust gas 
recirculation valve. The ignition timing will also be reset and the jet mixture 
solenoid and exhaust manifold will be inspected and replaced, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Local Hyundai dealers will inspect and repair returned cars free of charge. The 
service will take approximately 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai said the repairs and inspection will improve emissions performance and 
will have no effect on performance or fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Douglas, a spokeswoman for Hyundai, said the company instituted the 
emissions system repair campaign after being notified by the air resources 
board that a 1986 Excel being tested by the agency was not able to meet the 
state emissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the state pollution agency, said the potential 
problems with the car were uncovered in routine emissions testing earlier this 
year. He said the agency then tested 10 Excels and the results were averaged. 
The results showed they exceeded state emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the findings with Hyundai and they voluntarily decided to make a 
recall," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the company decided to recall the cars because of the company's 
"willingness to stand behind its products." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FREE RETUNING 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai dealers will modify the Excels at no charge, a procedure expected to 
take about 90 minutes. The dealers will: 
</P>
<P>
Install a shim into the choke system. 
</P>
<P>
Install a new air correction jet in the carburetor. 
</P>
<P>
Clean the sub-exhaust gas recirculation valve. 
</P>
<P>
Reset the ignition timing. 
</P>
<P>
Inspect and replace the jet mixture solenoid and exhaust manifold, if 
necessary.

The Radisson Plaza Hotel in Irvine has named two top executives who will 
oversee operations when the hotel reopens later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Aref Haffar of Corona del Mar has been named general manager, in charge of 
overseeing the hotel's management and executive staff. He was vice president of 
the western division for Servico, one of the country's largest hotel owners and 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
Sher L. Pasquini has been named resident manager, overseeing rooms divisions, 
operations, budget and guest services. She has worked in management positions 
with the Hyatt Hotel Corp. and was resident manager for the Sheraton Atlanta 
Airport Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The appointments come three months after the 293-room hotel was bought by a 
group of Orange County investors for $26 million in late June. At the time of 
the purchase, the property was a closed, bankrupt Registry Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
GMY Investment Co., a Newport Beach limited partnership of five investors, 
bought the hotel from Homestead Savings &amp; Loan. The group has been engaged 
in a multimillion-dollar renovation and has scheduled a reopening for November. 
</P>
<P>
The Registry fell on hard times as a result of intense competition in the 
airport area.

NAMIBIANS SAY THEY ARE SLOWING ILLICIT IVORY TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conservation officials in Namibia believe they are beginning to stem a surge in 
the illicit ivory trade that followed the withdrawal of South African troops 
under a U.N.-sponsored independence plan. 
</P>
<P>
They scored their latest success Sept. 16 when police smashed a major 
international smuggling syndicate after months of investigation, arresting 25 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Officials seized 980 elephant tusks, weighing about seven tons and valued at 
nearly $2 million, in what they believe was Africa's biggest haul of illegal 
ivory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest haul made in Africa," said Col. Johan Meintjies, head of 
the police diamond and narcotics squad, which also investigates poaching, after 
the raid in the farming town of Okahandja, 43 miles north of Windhoek. 
</P>
<P>
The tusks were found hidden behind a load of vegetables in a refrigerated 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
"These tusks came from more than 500 elephants, but we believe most of them 
were from animals killed in countries either to the north or the northeast of 
us," Brian Jones, a spokesman for the Department of Nature Conservation, told 
Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South Africa Police Help 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the South African administrator-general of Namibia, 
Louis Pienaar, said: "It was with the assistance of the South African police 
that the police in Namibia were able to achieve this result." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say ivory is smuggled from Angola, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe 
by way of Namibia or Botswana. It is then shipped to Taiwan and Hong Kong for 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men detained in the raid could face 10 years in jail under 
penalties that have been tightened since the latest poaching spate began. 
</P>
<P>
Poaching has increased this year since the number of South African forces in 
Namibia was reduced under the U.N. independence plan for the huge desert 
territory, which had been ruled by Pretoria since World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Since July only 1,500 South Africa troops have remained in Namibia, confined to 
two bases in the north under the U.N. plan. 
</P>
<P>
Police say poachers had previously been deterred by the South Africans, who 
were trying to prevent infiltration from Angola by pro-independence guerrillas 
of the South West Africa People's Organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smugglers Watched 
</P>
<P>
Before the latest arrests, police had followed the smugglers through Namibia 
from Rundu, a small town on the Angolan border in the northeast, watching them 
since July 16. 
</P>
<P>
"We waited until we thought we had the biggest and most fish before we 
pounced," said Meintjies. 
</P>
<P>
Rundu, on the Kavango River, has been a conduit for ivory from Angola and arms 
supplies to the rebel movement there, the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola. 
</P>
<P>
The area on either side of the river teems with elephants and other game, now 
threatened by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the seized elephant tusks were huge, weighing as much as 80 pounds, 
while others were tiny, taken from baby elephants. Police also seized 14 
rhinoceros horns and a few hippopotamus teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists fear that one of Namibia's most precious resources, its 
abundant wildlife and especially its threatened black rhinoceros, faces a major 
menace from poaching. 
</P>
<P>
"Since July this year we have captured at least 80 poachers," police Chief 
Inspector Kierie du Rand said. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas the police are using former bush fighters from Koevoet -- the now 
disbanded counter-insurgency unit -- to hunt the ivory dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Namibian police say the anti-poaching units have had a marked effect. But the 
South West Africa People's Organization opposes the use of the units, saying 
all former Koevoet members should be banned from police duty because they 
intimidate SWAPO supporters.

THIS ENVIRONMENTALIST SEES CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM

"It's changing faster than anything I've ever seen change." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Tuchman Mathews is not talking about her office at the World Resources 
Institute, now awash with loose folders during what she describes as a redesign 
of her filing system. She is talking about a much larger redesign: the 
wholesale shift in the public's attitude toward world environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started this institute in 1982," says Mathews, who is vice president 
of the highly regarded 85-member environmental research and policy 
organization, "there was no public concern about this global agenda. None of 
the other environmental groups had it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, apologizing for resorting to cliches, she uses phrases like "a sea change" 
and "a turning point" to describe the last two years. The change, she believes, 
has come in part from the increasingly wider flow of information. It also has 
come, in part, because of last summer's heat and the discussions it prompted of 
the global-warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
Much of it, however, she says, has to do with broader shifts on the 
international landscape. The winding down of the Cold War, the plans for a 
united Europe in 1992, the United States' change from a creditor to a debtor 
nation, these and other developments, she says, have "nothing to do with the 
environment," but their effect is "almost like throwing all the cards up in the 
air. We have the context for redesigning the whole system. So it's not as 
though you had to deal with the environment in the framework of a rigidly 
defined, familiar system: Everything is different." 
</P>
<P>
The result, she says, is that "this next 10 years could be a time of crucial 
innovations -- maybe even on a scale like that between 1945 and 1955, when our 
whole system got created." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'National Security' 
</P>
<P>
If such changes do come, it will be none too soon for Mathews. In an article in 
the Foreign Affairs spring issue -- being widely cited in environmental circles 
-- she states the case tersely in her lead sentence: "The 1990s will demand a 
redefinition of what constitutes national security." National security in the 
future, she says, will shift from defending against other nations to defending 
against environmental degradation. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding on that point in a recent interview, she noted that "there are some 
fairly fundamental changes needed in the international system." That post-World 
War II system, she says, was "basically set up to contain and manage conflict." 
Today's need is for "a system that fosters cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
In the early years of the environmental movement, she says, successes often 
came through confrontation between activists and large corporations. Now, with 
the movement's maturing and the issues becoming more global, the need is for 
cooperation, not only among contending groups within each nation, but also 
among nations. Achieving that, she says, will require significant changes in 
attitude, especially for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In the relations between the government and the private sector, she says, "we 
only seem to be able to think in terms of conflict. We think that's the natural 
order." Instead, she says, environmental groups need to work to "influence" 
corporations to become environmentally aware. "You've got to suck them in. And 
the only way to get that change is to engage them, almost against their will, 
in cooperative (efforts)." 
</P>
<P>
How would that be done? "To me, the powerful arguments are the self-interest 
ones," she says. There is, she says, a broader moral framework for the 
discussion -- an "ethical sense" of "not leaving the planet substantially more 
impoverished and less able to support human life at a reasonable quality" than 
it is today. In practical terms, though, she says she believes that public 
support for environmental issues is not so much "an ethical thing or a sense of 
right and wrong as it is a sense of self-interest and fear -- and also a 
quality-of-life thing." For that reason, she says, "the whole thrust of almost 
all the research we've done" at the institute "is that you can guarantee 
yourself a better life style if you use natural resources wisely." 
</P>
<P>
"Governments all over the world are both wasting money from their federal 
treasuries and encouraging poor resource use -- cutting down forests, 
overfishing, causing soil erosion that's very basically irreversible -- without 
getting a return from it." She describes the policies the institute urges as "a 
free lunch" and "a positive-sum game," in that, she says, they would result in 
a saving of resources and an improvement in the quality of life at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Among her opinions: 
</P>
<P>
* Population growth: "I don't think that there is any chance of an even 
reasonably acceptable level of human welfare if the global population levels 
off at 14 billion," she says, using the estimate often cited by demographers 
for the upper limit of 21st-Century growth, "or probably even 12 billion." 
Needed, she argues, are birth-control measures that would benefit all of 
humanity and that would not harm anyone. 
</P>
<P>
* Energy efficiency: "I never use the word conservation," she says. "I always 
use the word efficiency, because conservation for most people means freezing in 
the dark." What she calls the "energy efficiency resources" -- the amount that 
can be saved by more efficient use of energy -- are "much, much bigger than 
people yet understand." It is "difficult for Americans to grasp" the fact that 
"a fire you don't burn is a real resource," she says. "I think it must go back 
to the frontier and the fact that we just don't value efficiency -- we think 
that somehow means getting poorer." 
</P>
<P>
* Non-carbon-based energy resources: Even with the threat of the greenhouse 
effect causing people to look more seriously at nuclear power as a carbon-free 
source of energy, she says, "I don't think nuclear has much of a future." 
Within 20 years, she says, "solar is going to outcompete nuclear" both for 
centrally located electrical generating plants and as a source of photovoltaic 
energy used to extract hydrogen from water. 
</P>
<P>
* Fuel taxes: Mathews has proposed a $1-per-gallon gasoline tax that would be 
phased in at 10 cents a year over a decade along with mandated increases in 
fuel efficiency for automobiles. The result would be, she says, that as fuel 
economies rose, consumers would buy less of a more expensive product, spending 
no more money than they do today. They would, however, generate extra funds to 
help reduce the federal budget deficit while maintaining a fuel price that 
would make research and development of alternative energy sources more 
attractive. "I genuinely think that if Congress wasn't so terrified of the 
public reaction, they'd pass it," she says. "Every part of the political 
spectrum understands that this is the largest, most attractive revenue-getter 
-- easy, painless, one that has all sorts of positive benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Is Mathews an optimist then? "Oh, absolutely!" she says, noting, however, that, 
paradoxically, "the points of encouragement are in finding how wrong most of 
what we're doing is, and what the big horizon is for better results just by 
correcting what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
"The more you look at it, the more convinced you become that the barriers are 
neither economic nor technological, but political. And I find that optimistic, 
because clearly, if we choose, in our physical impact on the planet, we can 
tread far more lightly as a species, even with today's technology."

ADMIRERS OFFER PRAYER AND GIN FOR FITZGERALD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
ROCKVILLE, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight ancient oaks cast the shadows that dapple St. Mary's Cemetery. It is just 
a palm-of-the-hand parish burial plot that sits incongruously at one of 
Rockville's busiest intersections, where the Pike meets Viers Mill Road. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while cars shush ceaselessly by, there is a modicum of serenity at the top 
of this slow, slight slope. When F. Scott Fitzgerald buried his father here in 
1931, he wrote that he found it "very friendly, leaving him there with all his 
relations around him." 
</P>
<P>
That was before 12 lanes of traffic converged here, before construction of the 
Jefferson Plaza, a sleek, black-glass office building that gives back a 
darkened reflection of the automotive parade before it. Fitzgerald hoped to be 
buried here, but though he died on Dec. 21, 1940, this was not accomplished 
until 1975 when church officials revised their opinions of his Catholicism. Now 
he, his wife Zelda and their daughter Frances (Scottie), lie beside his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald would have been 93 two weeks ago, an anniversary that passed with as 
little notice as most of those before it. A few parishioners wandered over 
after the 10:30 Mass, a couple who run a downtown soup kitchen stopped by after 
the 12:15. At 2:30, a Trinity College English major demanded that her boyfriend 
pull over when he mentioned that they were driving by the grave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mostly Locals 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual for people to stop and say a prayer," says Monsignor Adam 
Kostick, the pastor, who occasionally finds a melted candle, an empty champagne 
bottle, a page of Fitzgerald's prose or a pair of white gloves atop the stone. 
A tour bus will stop every now and again, but mostly it is local people who 
come to pay homage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would have known about it if I hadn't gone to grade school at 
St. Mary's," says Tom Puglisi, a systems consultant in his late 20s, who was 
one of the earliest visitors recently. "I stop by and read the last line of 
'The Great Gatsby,' " which is inscribed on the gray horizontal slab that 
covers the grave: "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back 
ceaselessly into the past." 
</P>
<P>
Puglisi says he never sees anyone at the grave. "These bushes are new, though," 
he says, nodding toward two low, round hedges at the foot of the plot. "And I 
kind of think it is ironic that someone left a bottle of gin behind the 
headstone." 
</P>
<P>
The bottle is flat and not so wide that it wouldn't fit into a gentleman's suit 
coat pocket. There is just enough left to get drunk on if you took it down in 
quick gulps. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Rockville hasn't made much effort to capitalize on the grave site, 
perhaps because Fitzgerald, who was originally interred in Rockville Union 
Cemetery, was associated with the area only in death. There is an F. Scott 
Fitzgerald Triangle and an F. Scott Fitzgerald Theater, the former having 
previously commemorated a now-departed Dodge dealership. Mostly though, the 
writer's name comes up at the teeming intersection, in much the way John 
Hinckley's name comes up near the Washington Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of part of local folklore," says Paul Magno, a gentle man in his 
mid-30s, who lived in Rockville before opening the Zacchaeus Community Kitchen 
in Washington nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually quite fond of Zelda," says Magno's wife, Zacchaeus co-founder 
Marcia Timmel. "When I was young I had theatrical aspirations, and people like 
Zelda and Isadora Duncan and Tallulah Bankhead really spoke to that part of me 
that wanted to be a gypsy. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to act summer stock in Asheville, N.C., and we hung out at the Grove 
Park Inn. That was where he stayed when he came down to visit Zelda after she 
entered the sanitarium." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ross of Silver Spring, Md., mentioned the writer's name as he shot up 
Viers Mill Road and found himself escorting Colleen English, the Trinity 
English major, through the thick grass of the cemetery. English says many of 
her instructors think Fitzgerald is overrated. "So I don't really study him," 
she says. "I just read him on my own. I particularly like the short stories. I 
just like his writing style." 
</P>
<P>
So does Laurie Murphy, a high school student from Gaithersburg. "I like 
"Gatsby,' " she says. "I had to read it in school. Then I ended up liking it. I 
was kind of surprised."

OFFICIALS ADDRESS MISSIONARIES' ATTITUDES TOWARD OTHER PEOPLES

Take up the white man's burden 
</P>
<P>
 Send forth the best ye breed, 
</P>
<P>
 Go, bind your sons to exile 
</P>
<P>
 To serve your captives' need. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rudyard Kipling, 1899 
</P>
<P>
They no longer speak of their task as "the white man's burden," but some 
missionaries, perhaps influenced by a decade often characterized by 
self-indulgence and national boosterism, are said to be exporting 
self-righteousness along with their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The organizer of a conference this week on racism and ethnocentrism among 
missionaries said mission officials have noticed some evangelists are heading 
overseas with an inadequate respect for native cultures and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reagan years -- I don't know how else to say it -- have lessened the 
sensitivities and commitment to this," said Paul Yount of the National Council 
of Churches. "We'd thought we'd made some headway into this, but now we're not 
so sure." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Romero, general secretary of the mission program of the Board of World 
Ministries of the United Church of Christ, recalled being shocked when a 
missionary couple referred to Third World people as "heathens." 
</P>
<P>
"To have that terminology used now, I think, is an insult to the religious 
communities around the world," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Raised at Workshop 
</P>
<P>
Mission officials discussed issues of racism and ethnocentrism in missionary 
selection in a workshop earlier this week at Stony Point, N.Y. The meeting was 
sponsored by the Overseas Personnel Office of the Division of Overseas 
Ministries of the national council. 
</P>
<P>
Member churches of the national council had some 4,300 missionaries overseas in 
1985, slightly more than 10% of the total 43,000 Protestant missionaries, Yount 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, who is director of overseas personnel for the council, noted that many 
early missionaries took stands against colonial authorities and that 
missionaries have translated the Bible into almost every language and dialect. 
</P>
<P>
"I would stress that the missionary heritage in this is both positive and 
problematic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was called because many mission officials believed that the new 
generation of missionaries lacked sensitivity toward native cultures, Yount 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate has changed," he said. "There is not the more widespread concern 
about the racism within our own culture, classism within our own culture." 
</P>
<P>
Romero, however, said he thinks it is some of the older missionaries who "still 
carry some overtones of the past in which there is a bit of that white 
superiority that comes creeping in." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled, for example, how several such missionaries had joked about the odd 
names they had encountered overseas, despite the fact that they were making 
those remarks in the presence of natives of those countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they had the slightest notion it affected the people sitting 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Brown, vice president of the Division of Overseas Ministries for the 
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), said that her experience was different, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the missionaries that the Disciples are sending out today are less 
racist than the missionaries we were sending out 20 years ago," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enrichment' Is Goal 
</P>
<P>
She said many missionaries from her church, appointed for specific terms and 
invited by overseas organizations, speak not in terms of "making a tremendous 
impact" on the places they visit but of enriching their local churches when 
they come back. Missionaries who say their only reason for going overseas is 
that they feel called by God "are the first people we weed out," she said. "It 
usually means they have a paternalistic attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Romero sees hope for the future in the recruitment of younger missionaries and 
more members of minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great value to having people who have lived with racism, who have 
lived with oppression in their own countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, churches are adjusting to vast shifts in membership, with 
congregations swelling in Africa and Latin America as branches in Europe and 
the United States remain merely stable or, in some places, wither. 
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that the Disciples of Christ will have more members in Zaire than 
in the United States by the year 2000, and that the denomination has cut its 
corps of overseas missionaries in half, to 110, over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes have prompted new attitudes toward mission work, Yount said. 
</P>
<P>
Participants at a recent meeting of the World Council of Churches agreed, he 
said, that "if we're really going to have the sending of missionaries, we 
really need to have the exchange of missionaries."
