COVER STORY: NEW SHOWS ON THE BLOCK;

<P>
KCOP BUILDS PRIME-TIME PROGRAMMING IN MOVE AGAINST THE NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Independent television stations across the country -- those that have not 
joined the pioneering Fox net work -- are facing a prime-time programming 
challenge. With Fox's expanded schedule and a rise in cable TV production, an 
unprecedented number of original programs are cutting through the airwaves, 
coursing through coaxial cable and sizzling off satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more first-run television production now than there has ever been," 
said Lawrence Laurent, communications vice president of the New York-based 
Assn. of Independent Television Stations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of retreating into the network shadows this season, KCOP Channel 13 is 
fighting fire with fire. The Los Angeles independent has teamed with New York 
independent WWOR-TV and with MCA Television Entertainment to produce three 
flashy new TV series, debuting this week, to compete with the networks in prime 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now first-run products are the wave of the future," KCOP station manager 
Rick Feldman said. "I don't think it's possible to produce 24 hours a day of 
first-run product, but the more you can acquire the better position you're in 
to compete with the networks." 
</P>
<P>
KCOP has built two blocks of prime-time programming from 8-10 p.m. -- on 
Tuesdays with the new one-hour series "They Came From Outer Space" and 
"She-Wolf of London," and on Wednesdays with the syndicated Paramount series 
"Star Trek: The Next Generation" and the new "Shades of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Together, these four programs form what Feldman calls the Hollywood Premiere 
Network. Although billed as "network-quality series," their budgets have been 
estimated by insiders at $600,000 per episode, compared to the $1 million-plus 
spent on one-hour network series. 
</P>
<P>
If the new series receive solid ratings in Los Angeles and New York, they will 
be offered to smaller markets around the country in syndication. If that 
happens, the partners in Hollywood Premiere Network could cash in big. 
</P>
<P>
"If just one of our three new shows succeeds, we will come out very well," said 
general manager Michael Alexander of WWOR, which is owned by MCA Broadcasting 
Inc. "One of the ideas behind this is to develop your own prime-time shows so 
you can control your own inventory. That's where local stations have been 
hurting, paying the high cost of syndicated fare." 
</P>
<P>
Independent TV stations are also being squeezed by the skyrocketing costs of TV 
movies. Packages from film studios -- traditionally the bread and butter of 
independent TV stations -- are being snatched up by cable channels who can 
afford to pay higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, USA Network made headlines when it paid an estimated $50 million 
to $60 million for a package of 26 Touchstone films, including "Dead Poets 
Society," "Three Men and a Baby" and "Good Morning, Vietnam." It was the first 
time a basic cable network preempted the syndication market on a major motion 
picture package. 
</P>
<P>
To compete in the marketplace, independent TV stations are increasingly banding 
together and forming alliances with movie studios to produce programming. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had infinite variations on that theme over the last 10 or 15 years," 
said Laurent, who is the former TV critic for the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
With occasional Top 10 rating hits in "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With 
Children," the aspiring Fox network has proven that there is indeed strength in 
numbers -- even though more than half of its 133 primary affiliates are UHF 
stations. (NBC, ABC and CBS have about 200 affiliates each.) 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV reportedly tried to persuade Fox 
affiliates to jump ship in an attempt to form yet a fifth TV network. 
</P>
<P>
"Producers are no longer restricting their aspirations to the three networks, 
because they're learning that there is money to be made elsewhere," KTLA 
general manager Steve Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA is part of Tribune Broadcasting, a network of seven major independent 
stations that reach about 20% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more of a sense that we have to be the masters of our own future," 
said Bell, who has several original KTLA series in the works. "That's 
definitely a trend with independent stations."

One of my favorite shows, "The Young Riders," was pulled from its time slot in 
mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
It was given little advertising but found an audience and started to move up 
(in the ratings) when it was replaced by "Twin Peaks." Due to a lot of hype and 
marketing by ABC, this "innovative" "Peaks" series with its "brilliant 
director" had good ratings in the beginning, but interest dwindled. "The 
Riders" survived to a second season. But as the Emmys passed "Peaks" by, I 
wondered: What was all the fuss about?

In watching the debut of KNBC's show, "Memories, Then and Now" (Sept. 15), I 
found it biased in its portrayal of the segment showing teen idols of the past 
and present. They did capture the prominent teen entertainers of the last three 
decades, but they seem to have forgotten a significant group of the '70s, The 
Jackson Five.

I am sick and tired of the language on TV. Little by little they are adding 
more each season. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to good, clean shows like in the '60s and '70s? I don't go for 
the answer that it needs to keep the shows realistic. Baloney!

PRIVATE LIVES: THOUGHT FOR FOOD ; 
</P>
<P>
YOU'RE NO LONGER JUDGED BY WHAT YOU WEAR OR DRIVE; NOW IT'S WHAT YOU EAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SO WHAT WILL it be? Dim sum? Greek? Mexican? Thai? Ethiopian? Punjab? 
Decisions, decisions. New York Pizza? Chicago Pizza? California Pizza? A person 
could starve to death in the time it takes to decide where to go to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just a matter of having a lot of choices. Food has become everyone's 
3-D Rorschach test, an edible tool for self-definition and social judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Take my friend Katie's latest warning bell. "I never thought a man's eating 
habits would affect the way I perceived him as a potential partner," says 
Katie, a vegetarian. But recently she accepted an invitation to the Hollywood 
Bowl. "I was doing the picnic," she says. "But when I asked what he liked, he 
said, 'There's something you better know. I don't eat vegetables or fruit.' I 
asked about pasta salad. He said no. Coleslaw, no. Potato salad, no. Finally, I 
asked, 'Well what do you eat?' And he said, 'Meat. Just meat.' " 
</P>
<P>
What is he, a crocodile? 
</P>
<P>
There's always something objectionable about another person's diet. If it's not 
animal fat, it's Milano cookies, or too much garlic. Or worse, it's some 
politically incorrect foodstuff that anybody with half a social conscience is 
boycotting. (Why do they always boycott tasty products such as tuna and grapes 
instead of things I'd never miss -- such as turnips?) 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I'm hoping for ecological sanctions against the fryer, my sworn 
food enemy, which follows me wherever I go. On a recent trip to the Southwest, 
it seemed that kitchens had thrown away the broiler and the conventional oven 
and replaced them with giant vats of bubbling lard. "All I want is a baked 
potato," I feebly insisted as the waitress recited the specials: deep-fried 
chicken, chicken-fried steak, French fries, hush puppies, fritters, doughnuts. 
"Have you tried the Indian fry bread?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
I'd also like a moratorium on restaurants that flaunt live originals of what 
you're about to eat. I've learned to avert my eyes when I walk into Chinese 
seafood restaurants and see the doomed fish swimming around the tank. But does 
the management have to put a guy in a chicken suit beckoning outside California 
Chicken Burger? Of course, it's better than in Spain, where animal legs with 
hair are an essential part of the decor. I don't eat meat, but I still have 
nightmares about the place in Asturias where my husband scarfed a huge plate of 
cold cuts under a ceiling full of dangling carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a baked potato?" I asked meekly. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I'm not a finicky eater compared to a lot of folks. I wouldn't dream 
of issuing verbal or written instructions to prospective hosts before I go out 
to lunch or dinner. I'm not kosher, hypoglycemic, an ova-lacto vegetarian, or 
doing Pritikin or Optifast. And I'm not a food snob either, unlike my husband, 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
He views eating as an grand adventure, whereas I just see it as a way to stay 
alive. We could land in a foreign country late at night, after not having eaten 
for 12 hours, and still Duke would troll the streets scrutinizing restaurant 
menus, seeking out the peak gastronomical experience. I wouldn't dare suggest a 
coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
"For the same price, you can have something awful or you can have something 
really good," Duke says. Of course, his idea of really good is more evolved 
than mine. 
</P>
<P>
I learned this early on in our relationship. One morning, I found him standing 
in my kitchen, scowling at the contents of my refrigerator. There were apples, 
a pitcher of Good Earth iced tea, a tub of yogurt -- my usual food staples -- 
plus bagels and cream cheese that I'd bought because I knew he was coming over. 
"Don't you have a red onion?" Duke asked accusingly. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to score gourmet points, I went to a designer produce store and 
asked for the best onion God ever made. Five dollars bought a Maui onion the 
size of a grapefruit, packaged in a net sheath with everything but a biography 
and a diploma. Duke was mollified -- briefly. Then he started looking for the 
capers. 
</P>
<P>
These days, you can't be too much of a culinary sophisticate. "It's gotten into 
regions now," my sister Laurie complains. "People who can't find Florida on a 
map know the difference between Sichuan, Hunan and Mandarin." 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I've never awakened in the middle of the night with a hankering for 
Middle Altitude Andean food. If I have to pick a restaurant, a modern day act 
of courage, I automatically head for my favorite sushi or salad bar. Needless 
to say, I'm not asked to pick very often. 
</P>
<P>
"You're lucky," Laurie says. "There's nothing worse than being responsible for 
a bad meal. You sit there all evening muttering lame excuses like 'I swear 
there were more specials the last time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't bother me. Just give me a baked potato.

TRIUMPHAL ARCHES; 
</P>
<P>
FESTOONED WITH VINES OR ROSES, THESE SIMPLE, GRACEFUL ARBORS BECKON GUESTS INTO 
A GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When an arbor is an elegant entry, it makes a simple but ceremonious statement: 
"Welcome to the garden." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara, interior designer Ann James uses a classic wooden arch to 
frame the entrance to her home, a turn-of-the-century gardener's cottage now 
detached from its original estate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best vines for Southern California covers the arch with delicate 
white flowers that bloom year-round. The botanical name, Solanum jasminoides, 
sounds prettier than the common name -- potato vine. Though this tomato 
relative can grow to 20 or 30 feet in a year or two, it never becomes 
ponderous; it remains thin and graceful, unlike many quick starters that soon 
become garden thugs. 
</P>
<P>
In West Los Angeles, a wooden arch designed by Richard Mosbaugh of Statice 
Landscape + Design is the dramatic portal to a lush front garden. Mosbaugh 
sculpted the land, creating a pathway that seems to follow a tree-lined valley. 
Steps of Bouquet Canyon stone and almost vertical slabs of grass held in place 
by netting are part of the pastoral illusion. 
</P>
<P>
To Mosbaugh, arches and arbors as entries not only connect a house to its 
garden but also add dimension, especially depth, even to small gardens. "An 
arbor is like a curtain," he says. "The curtain opens, and there is the 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
Fall is the best time to plant just about anything because the weather is cool 
and rainy. An arbor installed and planted now will be welcoming guests to your 
garden by next spring.

'LARKS WITHOUT HEADS' -- A WHIMSICAL NAME FOR AN ELEGANT PROVENCAL DISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS, Colman Andrews is the author of Catalan Cuisine (Atheneum). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
AMERICAN-BORN, French-trained chef Patrick Healy cooks six days a week at 
Champagne in West Los Angeles, the restaurant that he owns with his wife, 
Sophie. On the Healys' day off, though, it's Sophie who makes dinner -- and 
that's fine with the chef. "Sophie is a really good cook," he says with genuine 
enthusiasm. "That's one of the first things I found out about her." 
</P>
<P>
Sophie is herself French -- born in Avignon and raised in Cannes. "Food was 
always very important in my family," she explains. "And in families like mine 
in Provence, the girls of my generation didn't have permission to go out at 
night, even on weekends. We were expected to stay home and help our mothers 
feed the family. That's how I learned to cook. Luckily, I liked it, so I didn't 
mind staying home all that much. And now I love to do it whenever I have the 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick and Sophie Healy met in 1980, in the village of Plasscassier, where 
Patrick was learning the French way with meat and pate at a local butcher shop 
before apprenticing in the kitchens of several top French restaurants. When 
Sophie got to know Healy a bit, he recalls, she invited him to her family's 
house for dinner. And there, one of the first things she prepared for him was a 
dish that remains perhaps his favorite of her specialties to this day -- an old 
Nicoise creation with the colorful, if vaguely off-putting, name of alouettes 
sans tetes -- larks without heads. 
</P>
<P>
The dish is so named because these rolled, tied, well-browned little bundles of 
meat do indeed resemble the headless carcasses of small birds. Monikers of this 
sort apparently appeal to the Provencal sense of humor, because the region also 
has dishes with names such as fausses grives or "false thrushes," which are 
thin slices of pork liver stuffed with herbs, and caillettes de Nice or "little 
Nicoise quails," which aren't quails at all but quail-shaped croquettes of 
spinach, minced chicken liver and rice wrapped in crepinette or caul fat. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Healy doesn't consider alouettes sans tetes to be a substitute for 
anything, though. "This is real traditional Nicoise family cooking," Healy 
says. "It's what you're likely to be served if you go over to almost anybody's 
house for dinner in the region." 
</P>

BALZER ON SPIRITS: WYBOROVA VODKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VODKA IS A BEVERAGE that generally isn't associated with Poland. Therefore, it 
may be of some surprise that that country produces Europe's best-selling vodka: 
Wyborowa. In previous centuries, when Polish royalty called for the best vodka 
they asked for wyborowa, meaning "the choicest." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Europeans also are asking for the choicest. Wyborowa (pronounced 
Vee-ba-rova) is a 100% rye grain spirit, produced with soft water from deep 
artesian wells, which accounts for its crystalline purity and exceptionally 
clean smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
Wyborowa ($12.95 for 750 milliliters 80-proof) begins with the most select rye 
grain that comes from thousands of small farms; during malting (soaking, 
sprouting and kiln-drying the grains) in wellspring water, starch is converted 
to glucose. Then fermentation begins with triple distillation of the mash to 
follow at high proof to extract all congeners, or impurities, until the 
resulting liquid is colorless, odorless, and by official definition, without 
distinctive character, aroma or taste. 
</P>
<P>
The state-owned and -operated Polmos distillery is in Poznan in central Poland 
and has been producing Wyborowa for centuries. Although vodka is usually made 
with grains such as rye and wheat, I was told that 75% of all vodka production 
in Poland uses potatoes. I wondered how potato vodka would taste. I found my 
answer through a blind tasting of the Wyborowa (rye) and the Luksusowa 
(potato), both at 80-proof. To the eye and the nose, there is no difference at 
all. To the palate, yes, a minimal, but detectable difference. Neither I nor 
two of my colleagues were able to identify which was which, only that one was 
softer. That turned out to be the potato vodka, ($15.99 for 750 milliliters 
80-proof). 
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago, devotees stashed their vodka in snowbanks. Now you can store it 
in your freezer, ready at any time to be served icy cold, neat -- in the Polish 
tradition. Na zdrowie! (Nah-stro-vyeh) "To your health!" Robert Lawrence Balzer

OUTTAKES: THAT'S TRENDY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marlee Matlin, the hearing-impaired actress who won a best-actress Oscar for 
"Children of a Lesser God" (1987), has taken a "small part" -- only two weeks 
work -- in "The Linguini Incident." And producer Arnold Orgolini still seems 
bowled over that he's landed Matlin -- and other name talent -- for his "under 
$4-million" picture. 
</P>
<P>
When "Linguini" begins filming shortly in downtown L.A., Matlin will join star 
Rosanna Arquette and co-stars David Bowie, Kelly Lynch, Andre Gregory and 
Shelley Winters. 
</P>
<P>
Argolini credits "wonderful material" for attracting actors and crew willing to 
work at "considerably less" than their usual rates. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic comedy, written by Tamar Brott and director Richard Shephard, has 
Arquette as a waitress in an ultra-trendy L.A. restaurant. Along with a 
girlfriend (Lynch), she gets involved with a British bartender (Bowie) 
desperately seeking a green card -- through marriage to a Yank. 
</P>
<P>
Matlin plays a cashier in the boite. How trendy is it? 
</P>
<P>
"So trendy," Orgolini says, "that she has her own interpreter." John M. Wilson

SOAP OPERA LOVERS are as rabid about their passion as sports fans are about 
theirs. And if actor Jim Warren, creator of Soap Star! trading cards, has his 
way, you may soon be hearing, "I'll trade you a Billy Warlock for a Melissa 
Brennan." 
</P>
<P>
A Soap Star! set ($6) -- which includes 12 full-color cards, one of which is a 
soap alumnus who's made it big -- features such popular performers as Kin 
Shriner (Scott) of "General Hospital" and Robin Mattson (Gina) of "Santa 
Barbara" and provides bios and little-known facts about the stars. 
"Surprisingly," Warren says, "one of every 10 orders is from a man."

HATS ON 
</P>

ONE THING IS CERTAIN: When you buy a hat from the Hat Gallery, you won't see 
yourself coming and going. With some 200 hat blocks to choose from, 
proprietor/designer Elizabeth Marcel creates one-of-a-kind hats that she refers 
to as "free-forming, hand-sculpted art. 
</P>
<P>
Most depict a nostalgic European flavor," she says. "For instance, a hat may 
dip dramatically on one side." 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing vintage straw (some of which is hand-dyed and comes from the 
Philippines, China, Italy and Ecuador) or fur felts (from Czechoslovakia, 
Switzerland, France and Italy), the hats may be adorned with antique ribbons, 
buttons, folded silk flowers or tapestries. Depending on what Marcel finds on 
her buying travels, some of her creations may even feature such unlikely 
details as Victorian curtain pull cords or drapery fabric circa the 1930s. 
While there's always a good selection of hats (ranging from $195 to $310), 
special-request orders are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who'd like to learn how to create their own millinery, Marcel 
teaches monthly classes ($200 for two consecutive sessions). Not only can you 
become a hat sculptor, but you will also be contributing to a worthwhile cause: 
Proceeds go to the downtown L.A. Union Rescue Mission for the homeless.

CALIFORNIA IMPRESSIONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE CLARITY AND FORCE of Southern California's ambient light -- as well as our 
Mediterranean climate and gorgeous natural landscape -- lured artists here in 
droves at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Often compared to French painters of the time, these California Impressionists 
hailed from the eastern United States and Europe; 75 of their soft and silken 
plein-air paintings, by nine artists, compose "California Light, 1900-1930," on 
display Oct. 12 through Jan. 6 at the Laguna Art Museum. The works pay tribute 
to the beauty and brilliance that was Southern California during an earlier, 
more tranquil time.

'MO BLUES' AND HARD BOP FROM BRANFORD MARSALIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
*** BRANFORD MARSALIS ET AL. "Music From 'Mo' Better Blues' "; Columbia 
</P>
<P>
This album by the Marsalis quintet, with Terrence Blanchard in the trumpet role 
played in the film by actor Denzel Washington, is an amalgam of hard bop, 
R&amp;B and other diversions and will appeal mainly to those who have seen the 
film. The title cut, and the ballad "Again Never," both composed by Spike Lee's 
father, Bill Lee, stand out. There are two versions of W.C. Handy's antique 
"Harlem Blues," updated and sung by Cynda Williams, the actress/vocalist who 
performed the songs on screen. Caveat: fast forward through "Pop Top 40," an 
out-of-context pseudo-pop affair, and "Jazz Thing," a simplistic pocket history 
of jazz in rap form. 
</P>
<P>
*** ANDRE PREVIN "Uptown" Telarc 
</P>
<P>
Previn edges even closer to pristine form in this, his second comeback-to-jazz 
celebration. Bassist Ray Brown is on hand again, and this time the guitarist is 
the long-respected Mundell Lowe. The subject matter helps: six Harold Arlen 
songs, seven Ellingtons, and one Duke-associated pop tune, "Five o'Clock 
Whistle." Previn nudges his way obliquely into a sensitive "Come Rain or Come 
Shine," and achieves a spiritual beauty on "Come Sunday." Except for the 
slightly hasty "It Don't Mean a Thing," everything swings with the utmost ease. 
</P>
<P>
**** TERRY GIBBS DREAM BAND "Volume Four: Main Stem" Contemporary 
</P>
<P>
This Gibbs CD is surely the livest live session on record. Here are 17 men and 
a woman (pianist Pat Moran) who think as one, captured with brilliant sound (by 
the late engineer Wally Heider) at the Summit, the Hollywood nightspot that now 
houses the Club Lingerie. The leader's vibes are ingeniously woven into the 
arrangements by Bill Holman, Shorty Rogers and Al Cohn along with booting 
contributions by such soloists as trombonist Frank Rosolino, reedmen Joe Maini 
and Richie Kamuca and drummer Mel Lewis, all sadly no longer around, as well as 
by trumpeter Conte Candoli and saxman Bill Perkins, who are still vitally among 
us. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 CYBILL SHEPHERD "Vanilla" Gold Castle 
</P>
<P>
At her best, actress/singer Shepherd has revealed a genuine talent with a jazz 
sensitivity; however, this reissue of a date made in 1979, after she had 
returned home to Memphis, is weighted down by a ragged band -- Fred Ford and 
his Beale Street Orchestra. Except for the inane title tune, most of the songs 
are jazz/pop standards. Still, there is a rare value here in the person of the 
late Phineas Newborn, a jazz piano giant, and his rhythm section -- his brother 
Calvin (guitar), Jamil Nasser (bass) and Bill Tyus (drums). Shepherd is in good 
voice on "My Ship" -- where Newborn has the first chorus to himself and where 
the band is too subdued to be disconcerting. Questions: Whatever became of that 
fine album she made backed by Stan Getz? Why doesn't she return now to the 
studios, to make the superior jazz session of which she is capable? 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 VINCENT HERRING "American Experience" Music Masters 
</P>
<P>
Herring, now 25, taped these sessions in 1986 and 1989 with two different but 
equally compatible hard bop groups. Heard recently in Nat Adderley's quintet, 
he has emerged as one of the most passionate new voices on alto and soprano 
saxophones. He is represented as a composer along with Charles Lloyd, Horace 
Silver and his pianist Bruce Barth. The earlier cuts, made when he was only 21, 
reveal that he had already reached a rare plateau of maturity. Herring has come 
a long way from the streets of Manhattan, where he was playing outdoors as 
recently as 1984. LEONARD FEATHER

More than you need to know about blues-rocker Rory Gallagher and less than 
you'd like to know about Sinead O'Connor: Though updated from the 1987 "Irish 
Rock" for American publication, this detailed guide seems out of date and 
parochial considering the worldwide impact of O'Connor, who only gets a brief 
mention, though her picture is on the cover. What's more, a deserved 
dissertation on Van Morrison suffers from Prendergast's labored critical 
analyses. Still, sections on the early beat groups and Irish folk-rock are 
fascinating accounts of pop musical evolution outside the more familiar 
Britain/U.S. breeding grounds, while the "Modern Music" chapter does a good job 
showing the cultural/musical context that launched U2. STEVE HOCHMAN

What more can you ask of a video than it turn someone who was only mildly 
interested in a veteran performer into a fan? Part of the credit on "Evening" 
goes to director Bud Schaetzle, who has done an excellent job of capturing the 
intimacy of a Griffith club performance in this modest but winning 45-minute 
package. But the video's most important element is Griffith herself. A 
singer-songwriter whose artful, warm music blends elements of country and folk, 
Griffith sometimes seems a bit too understated on record, but she blossoms here 
with a series of songs that are equally rich in detail and spirit. ROBERT 
HILBURN

** 1/2 Queensryche, "Empire," EMI. A critic's dilemma: Seattle's Queensryche is 
a politically correct heavy-metal band, non-sexist, anti-oppression, anti-drug, 
involving its huge teen audience in its relatively sophisticated analyses of 
social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Yet here the band is absolutely mainstream, with the kind of bombastic power 
ballads, sappy hooks and screeching Dio-esque vocals -- waaaaaah!!! -- that 
tend to inspire anybody but the converted to snap the radio to an all-talk 
station. But someone is listening. The album only took two weeks to break into 
the national Top 10. JONATHAN GOLD

*** Robert Cray Band, "Midnight Stroll," Mercury. A stinging guitarist, a 
smokin' vocalist, a true brown-eyed handsome man, young Cray revamps his band, 
adds the semi-legendary Memphis Horns and checks in to the Cheatin' Place with 
yet another solid album of nether soul noir blues. "The Forecast (Calls for 
Pain)" and the title track -- with its inside aside about "Howlin' Wolf on the 
radio" -- are the standout songs, but Cray's sinewy, Sam Cooke-in' vocals cut 
through the now-familiar shadowy ambience like the light reflecting off a 
freshly drawn knife. DON WALLER

*** AC/DC "The Razor's Edge" Atco 
</P>
<P>
This Australian band has been accused of making the same album over and over 
since it began in the mid-'70s, thumping assemblages of pentatonic power chords 
and leering innuendo -- a style so distinctive that you can always recognize an 
AC/DC tune on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
It's rock 'n' roll stripped to its absolute basics of noise, beat and schoolboy 
aggression -- any high school dude with a guitar can reproduce any AC/DC riff. 
</P>
<P>
The group's last few albums have sold well, but nowhere near the 
umpteen-million copies they routinely sold between 1979 and 1982. AC/DC's 
rotation on hard-rock stations is probably nearly as high as Led Zep's, but 
what's played is mostly 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
This time out, the band hired hot Aerosmith/Bon Jovi producer Bruce Fairburn, 
and the album still rocks like AC/DC, but a rather slick version thereof. 
</P>
<P>
AC/DC's trademark gritty guitars are softened up; studio swooshing fills the 
famous empty space between power chords; vocalist Brian Johnson actually tries 
to sing instead of yelp like a wolverine. The tinge of mainstream rock may make 
longtime fans scream, but "Razor's Edge" is probably AC/DC's best album since 
1985's "Fly on the Wall." JONATHAN GOLD

*** 1/2 THE WATERBOYS "Room to Roam" Ensign/Chrysalis 
</P>
<P>
Here's a perfect album if you're in love. Mike Scott certainly is -- with a 
woman (he giddily recounts his discovery in "A Man Is in Love") and with his 
adopted rural Irish home (whose music and inspiration fill this collection). 
</P>
<P>
And Scott the Scotsman is also still in love with the spiritual quest that has 
fueled the four previous Waterboys albums. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, though, the earthy music and the contented tone make this seem a 
bit of a retreat. Historically, a seeker's art is more compelling when he still 
hasn't found what he's looking for -- and this album suggests that's true in 
Scott's case. With the acoustic mix of reels and Van Morrison-influenced 
explorations on 1988's "Fisherman's Blues," Scott and crew struck a balance 
between the light and the heavy. Only in a few places here do they leave the 
pub jam session and get back to the hunt for meaning. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the pure existential joy of these 17 songs and fragments 
makes this far and away Scott's least pompous outing -- unless you think a 
Scotsman's guileless romance with Ireland falls into the latter category. If 
you're a romantic yourself, it would be hard to pass through this ceilidh 
without catching its spirit. STEVE HOCHMAN

TELL TV TIMES: WHAT ARE THE BEST OF THE NEW SHOWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They (whoever "they" is) said one hit of the new season would be "Fresh Prince 
of Bel Air," starring Will Smith (below). But what do you say? As the fall 
season is under way, we want to know what new shows you pick to be a hit with 
audiences and which ones have already struck your fancy. 
</P>
<P>
Here are responses to the Sept. 16 question: What network do you turn to for 
news? 
</P>
<P>
What network do I turn to for critical news? That's easy. Tom Brokaw is far and 
away the most knowledgeable, professional and outstanding news specialist 
around. He presents the news as it is and where it is! 
</P>
<P>
Gary Traxler, North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
In response to your request as to what network we turn to for news, we always 
watch Tom Brokaw. He's the best! 
</P>
<P>
William C. Boyd, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
I turn almost exclusively to the CNN World Report for the world news and then 
to Jerry Dunphy on Channel 9 (KCAL) for local news. 
</P>
<P>
Mederic W. Roberts, Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
First, for in-depth news -- KCET MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour. Second, for national 
news -- Peter Jennings' "World News Tonight." Third, for local California and 
Western news -- Channel 5 KTLA "News at 10." 
</P>
<P>
Odile M. Bleasdale 
</P>
<P>
We watch Peter Jennings' "World News Tonight" for news events or crises. We 
have turned the dial but always go back to Peter Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
Jacklyn Kerr, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
I have been listening to ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings for a 
long time every night and no one else. I think he is terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemarie Grand, Reseda 
</P>
<P>
My response is Peter Jennings, Peter Jennings, Peter Jennings. He is sensitive, 
well-spoken, intelligent and compassionate. It is very disappointing to tune in 
"World News Tonight" and find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie L. Gilmore, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
When I turn on the news, I want in-depth reporting and someone with 
intelligence doing the reporting. Among the three major network anchors, Dan 
Rather is my choice every night. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kosner, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
For news, it's CBS and Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
Mari Siegel, Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
I watch quite a bit of TV news, so naturally CNN is an important part of my 
viewing "diet." The people at CNN do a terrific job, especially when there is a 
crisis or major news event which requires continuous coverage. But there is 
still much room for improvement, and if there were a polished over-the-air 
network service, I might well watch it instead.

PRIMED FOR NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with Don Petersen of Chino (Viewers' Views, Aug. 5); KCAI's Prime 9 
News is awful. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many mistakes, pauses and just plain stupidity that at times it is 
difficult to imagine that Jerry Dunphy would be a part of such a disaster. And 
more important, the former team of Wendy Gordon, Tom Lawrence and Scott St. 
James certainly could have been integrated into the new format. 
</P>
<P>
I, too, have switched to Channel 5's "News at 10" for consistency and, most of 
all, credibility.

I am delighted to finally read something about "Northern Exposure" in your TV 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
I was beginning to think we were the only ones watching it. It is the best 
program to come along in years and we are hoping it will not just disappear. 
The plots are so imaginative and original, very humorous and the characters are 
wonderful. Beautiful scenery -- no car crashes, murders, hokey families, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Please, please help keep it on the air all year.

Last year Bravo put out a call to high school drama departments, asking them to 
send in videotapes of their productions for the first annual National High 
School Theater Competition.

The winners, judged on the basis of artistic and creative merit, were high 
schools from Massachusetts and Minnesota, both performing Shakespeare plays,

of $2,500 -- will be shown on Bravo's short cultural news update, Arts-Break,

Bravo programs.

NOTEBOOK: MCCARTY PUSHES HIS PROJECT IN DENVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's Michael McCarty up to now? As he awaits hoped-for approval from Santa 
Monica voters this November to get on with his long-delayed luxury beachfront 
hotel project, he is simultaneously attempting to buy the entire Tivoli retail 
complex in Denver -- site of his Adirondacks restaurant in that city. 
</P>
<P>
There have long been rumors that his Denver outpost was in financial trouble 
and was for sale. On the contrary, says McCarty, "The Tivoli is just about to 
really happen. There's a big college complex there with about 35,000 students 
within walking distance. The city has just built new freeway on- and off-ramps 
right there, the 16th Street mall bus is extending its route to come all the 
way to the Tivoli, and there's going to be free shuttle service from downtown. 
Besides that, the new Denver convention center just opened about two blocks 
away -- and the city just got a bond issue approved to build a new baseball 
stadium practically across the street." 
</P>
<P>
If McCarty's buyout attempt is successful -- the price tag has been estimated 
at between $13 and $18 million -- he plans to eliminate all retail business in 
the complex, with the possible exceptions of a music/video store and a 
bookshop, and turn the Tivoli into a restaurant and entertainment center 
instead. Besides Adirondacks, Tivoli has a diner, a disco, a hot dog and 
hamburger place, and a Morton's of Chicago restaurant. "In addition," McCarty 
says, "we want to put in a 12-plex theater, a country-and-Western bar, a sports 
bar, a Mexican concept, an Italian concept, a bakery. It'll all be big, fun, 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
ADIOS: Sabroso in Venice will close Oct. 15th. It's the old story, says 
proprietor Jeanine Coyle: "Our lease ran out, and the rent increase was more 
than the restaurant could bear." Although she has tried to find another 
reasonably priced location in the same area, she adds, her attempts have been 
unsuccessful thus far and she has no plans to reopen at this time. 
</P>
<P>
THE SALTY COD: I am in receipt of a do-it-yourself press release from an 
organization calling itself Les Chevaliers de Morue -- which translates roughly 
as The Knights of Salt Cod. It reads in part: "A fistful of soggy fish sticks 
to I Cugini (in Santa Monica) for having taken its salt cod and goat cheese 
pizza off the menu! One of the few salt cod dishes appearing on any menu in Los 
Angeles, this delicious preparation might have earned new fans for this most 
wonderful of fish. Why was it stricken from the menu? Because not many people 
ordered it? So what? For heaven's sakes, Cugini people, it's not as if salt cod 
spoils!" 
</P>
<P>

THE COMEBACK KID

<P>
Oh, those poor filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
According to producer Stuart Birnbaum, "It's a crime when you realize that so 
many good filmmakers don't get to work because of a feeling that they're too 
old." Well, it's a crime that we women have to share a world with 91-year-old 
men such as Bennett who maintain that a woman of 29 is "long in the tooth."

THE COMEBACK KID

<TEXT>
<P>
An unfortunate error in Pat H. Broeske's intriguing article about the ageless 
writer Charles Bennett ("Now Here's a Real Comeback," Sept. 30): Scratch "Anna 
Ondry." She never existed. 
</P>
<P>
Hitchcock's choice for leading woman in "Blackmail" was the well-known German 
actress Anny Ondra. 
</P>
<P>
Ondra's private life was highlighted by her marriage to German heavyweight 
boxer Max Schmeling. Schmeling is remembered as the fighter who knocked out Joe 
Louis, only to be cut down himself in the first round of their rematch. 
</P>
<P>
All that may be far less significant than the revelation long after the end of 
World War II that Schmeling risked his life during the horrors of Nazi Germany 
to hide and help save countless Jews who otherwise would almost certainly have 
perished during the Holocaust.

LYRICS TOO FOUL FOR PORN-VIDEO WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in regard to daily and Sunday Calendar articles over the past months 
that have implied that Luther Campbell of gutter-mouthed rap fame is the victim 
of a bigoted campaign to take away his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps your paper will not print a few views opposing Campbell's relentlessly 
self-serving tactics, but Newsweek had the guts to publish some of his "lyrics" 
so readers could see what this man is trying to defend. 
</P>
<P>
He's made the rounds of talk shows and has been quoted in many newspapers about 
how the racist cops passed by racks of adult videos before singling out his 
record (2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be") for something to ban. 
</P>
<P>
I write adult videos -- more than 150 in the last five years. Other than the 
fact that consenting adults are having sex, I feel my work is as non-offensive 
as this type of "entertainment" can get. No violence, no profanity, no drugs, 
no bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
I've even written a few murder-mysteries for this genre, and in them I couldn't 
go as far as to have one of the players carry a gun. That's how concerned the 
adult video industry is about bringing the scorn of censorship down on itself. 
</P>
<P>
Millionaires like Luther Campbell have no such concern. They just use papers 
like yours to sell their obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
As a representative of the "porn biz," I am offended that Campbell would 
mention my work and his in the same breath. I am further offended that The 
Times is so taken in by this opportunist.

ROCKING HORSE RANCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROCKING HORSE RANCH in Riverside County is busy "breeding" high-styled mounts 
for the toddler set. Built to last long enough to grow into heirlooms, they are 
handcrafted from southern mountain pine. 
</P>
<P>
A custom-order Ranch pony features the child's name and birth date branded 
beneath the mane (the same spot where a real registered Arabian would be 
branded). Rather than paint her rocking horses, master builder Marie Crain 
generally stains them a rich, nut brown, though she is willing to match the hue 
to other furniture. 
</P>
<P>
All the trimmings are intact -- including a flowing acrylic yarn mane and tail, 
genuine leather reins and a comfortable vinyl saddle. Prices begin at $45 for 
the 18-inch table-model version. Among the ridable models, a 25-inch rocking 
horse sells for $115, a 29-incher for $135, and a 38-inch size for $165. For 
those rocking-horse aficionados who like them more classical, a bit of 
Victorian painting -- flowers and ribbons -- can be added ($250 for the 38-inch 
model). 
</P>
<P>
Recent additions to the Rocking Horse Ranch line include an 18-inch carousel 
horse ($60) and a 21-inch rocking horse lamp ($65). And ambitious sorts can 
order a 38-inch rocking horse kit ($115). 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, on these horses, there's no way the bandits can escape: No matter 
how fast they gallop, these animals cannot tip over; the ends of the rockers 
have been specially designed to prevent tipping. 
</P>
<P>
 For orders and information, telephone Rocking Horse Ranch, (714) 926-4304.

ART GALLERY, DIRECTOR ACQUITTED IN MAPPLETHORPE PHOTO EXHIBIT; 
</P>
<P>
OBSCENITY: JURY REJECTS THE PROSECUTION'S CONTENTION THAT SEXUALLY GRAPHIC 
WORKS LACK ARTISTIC VALUE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An art gallery and its director were acquitted Friday of obscenity charges by a 
jury that rejected prosecution claims that sexually graphic photos by Robert 
Mapplethorpe lacked artistic value. 
</P>
<P>
The obscenity trial was the nation's first of an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"What a great day!" gallery director Dennis Barrie told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of four men and four women returned the verdicts after slightly more 
than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie smiled slightly as a clerk read the verdict. When the clerk finished, 
Barrie smiled broadly, said, "All right!" and hugged his attorney, H. Louis 
Sirkin. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators in the Hamilton County Municipal Court room shouted and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David Albanese expelled gallery board Chairman Roger Ach and Robert 
Allen, whose video production company sponsored the exhibit, when they jumped 
out of their seats to hug Barrie. 
</P>
<P>
The jury cleared the Contemporary Art Center and Barrie of misdemeanor charges 
of pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related material. Barrie 
could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000, and the gallery 
fined $10,000, if convicted on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a very emotional moment. It's been a very hard time for 
me," Barrie said. "We did something very important for this city. We stood up 
for the 1st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major battle fought here today. It's a major battle for the arts and 
for freedom of expression in America." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, whose American Family Assn. in Tupelo, 
Miss., has fought National Endowment for the Arts funding for exhibits such as 
the Mapplethorpe, said, "This is not a landmark, Pearl Harbor decision. This 
was just another obscenity trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this really puts the NEA issue right back in the political arena where 
it belongs." 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, defense attorneys contended that there was no basis for 
the charges of using children in nudity-related material because the mothers of 
the children gave their consent. The prosecution contended that consent was not 
in writing when the exhibit opened. 
</P>
<P>
The defense also noted the U.S. Supreme Court's three-pronged test of 
obscenity: Material must appeal to a prurient interest in sex, be patently 
offensive according to contemporary community standards, and must lack 
redeeming artistic, scientific or political value. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury has made its decision. We accept it," said Frank Prouty, assistant 
city prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
During closing arguments, Prouty told jury members it was up to them to decide 
the artistic merit of the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"Are these Van Goghs, these five pictures?," he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Prouty told the jury to judge what they considered to be art using contemporary 
community standards, not the standards of art experts who testified for the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Prouty recited the fable of the vain emperor who, although naked, believed he 
was fully clothed because his subjects praised his imaginary clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"The art world wants to tell you these are art. And the townspeople sat there 
and watched the emperor walk down the street without any clothes on, but yet 
all his advisers told him 'You have a beautiful coat,' because nobody wanted to 
come out and tell them that it's not art. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the townspeople. Don't let somebody from outside come in and say it is 
art. You say whether these five pictures are like the emperor without any 
clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
Sirkin, Barrie's attorney, said the five photos no doubt offended some people, 
but have serious artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
He quoted from a speech by John F. Kennedy: 
</P>
<P>
"Society must set the artist free to follow his vision, wherever it takes him. 
We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda. It is a form of 
truth. The highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist, is to remain 
true to himself." 
</P>

"That's exactly what Dennis Barrie did," Sirkin said. "He wanted to share with 
this community a beauty that he felt was shown by an artist, Mr. Mapplethorpe." 
</P>
<P>
Sirkin reminded jurors that the same exhibit was shown in Philadelphia, Chicago 
and Berkeley without incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Cincinnati that different? Are we that childish? Are we not big enough to 
say we can't accept what other cities have seen?" Sirkin asked. 
</P>
<P>
Defense experts have testified that Mapplethorpe was an accomplished and 
respected photographer, and that photographs of the children were morally and 
sexually innocent. Mapplethorpe died last year of AIDS at age 42. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit drew 81,000 people during its seven-week run last spring, an 
attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. It closed Friday in Boston, 
where 103,000 tickets were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Marc Mezibov, representing the gallery, said the state failed to prove 
its case. No presentation was made to back up the assertion that the 
photographs were not legitimate art. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you thought why it is that no one for the state of Ohio came in and 
testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic value? Don't you think that 
if there were people out there who thought that, the state of Ohio would have 
found them?" Mezibov asked.

A bomb exploded at Defense Department headquarters in Manila, where authorities 
were holding Col. Alexander Noble, the leader of last week's Mindanao Island 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, a second bomb exploded outside the Finance Department in Manila. 
The blasts raised fears of continued unrest after Noble's secessionist revolt 
ended on the Philippines' second-largest island. In the first explosion, one 
bystander was injured and two jeeps were destroyed. The second bombing hurt no 
one, but destroyed a concrete plant box.

An animal rights group has won a court order against a Navy program to kill 
squirrels at a weapons station. The group claims the chemical bait used also 
threatens endangered species such as the San Joaquin kit fox and salt harvest 
mouse. U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on Friday granted a temporary 
restraining order to the Contra Costa County chapter of In Defense of Animals. 
</P>
<P>
The group sued the Navy in federal court, contending a squirrel-control program 
was started at the Concord Naval Weapons Station without an environmental 
impact report. Contra Costa County paid for half the poisoned grain but was not 
named in the lawsuit. The county has sponsored an eradication program for years 
that has not been challenged in court. About five tons of oats containing an 
anticoagulant were spread over 800 acres of the station before the ban was 
imposed.

The wife of the only American soldier still listed as a prisoner of war in 
Southeast Asia has committed suicide. Dorothy Marian Shelton died of a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound at her San Diego home late last week, according to 
the San Diego County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old mother of five was a founder of the national movement to 
account for all servicemen officially listed as POWs or missing in action from 
the Vietnam era. Police said she left a brief suicide note to her family and 
was apparently suffering from depression. Her husband, Air Force Col. Charles 
Shelton, was shot down while conducting a secret mission over northern Laos on 
April 23, 1965, his 33rd birthday. He was captured several days later. While 
Pentagon officials have speculated that Shelton probably died in Laos in the 
mid-1960s, his is the sole remaining name on the Southeast Asia POW list and 
his wife continued to receive his monthly active-duty paychecks. She often 
criticized the U.S. government for abandoning her husband and other missing 
soldiers.

A teen-ager pleaded not guilty to firing the gunshots that killed a Fresno man 
during a four-hour Labor Day weekend shooting rampage. Jermaine Johnson was 
arraigned on a first-degree murder charge and 17 other charges Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He was identified as the gunman in the death of Victor Diaz, 49, who was shot 
in front of his home, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Hoff. Nine others were 
wounded in the shootings. A juvenile court official ruled earlier this week 
that Johnson would be prosecuted as an adult. Another 16-year-old arrested with 
him faces a similar hearing in two weeks. Two others, ages 14 and 15, will be 
tried as juveniles. All four face one charge of first-degree murder in Diaz's 
death, as well as six counts each of attempted murder, five counts of armed 
robbery, and six other felony counts.

EXERCISE: IN THE MIDST OF A WORKOUT OR RUN, YOU FIND YOUR MIND'S A MILLION 
MILES AWAY. IT'S CALLED DISASSOCIATION AND ATHLETES SAY IT'S LIKE A VACATION.

"Another glass of Orvieto, sweetheart?" you ask as you prop yourself on the 
velvet cushions and reach for the ice bucket. The gondolier is averting his 
eyes, but Candice Bergen, looking un-Murphy Brownish, isn't. She smiles as you 
float beneath the Bridge of Sighs, and soft mandolin music drifts by on the 
Venetian summer air . . . 
</P>
<P>
So why are your legs starting to feel like Jell-O? And where did that burning 
feeling in your throat come from? Why is that stinging sweat rolling in your 
eyes? Why are you wearing Nikes? And what happened to Candice? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome back to Mile 4 of your daily run, after you've been doing it again -- 
letting yourself sink into the random mental state that seems to occur when 
people perform a repetitive athletic activity. 
</P>
<P>
You could be riding a stationary bike, swimming laps, or reeling off miles at 
the local track. But your mind is balancing your checkbook, planning your next 
day's schedule or replaying your prom date. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes call this state disassociation. 
</P>
<P>
It's the ability -- or tendency -- to take the mind off the business at hand 
and let the body work while the brain takes a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"If a runner is going to run 10 miles on a training run over a familiar course, 
for example, he's not going to worry too much about what's going on," said Dr. 
Brent Rushall, a professor of physical education at San Diego State University 
who has studied the effects of concentration -- or the lack of it -- on 
athletic performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The stimuli will be familiar to him. He can then think about things that 
happened at work, run through problems, plan a paper he's writing, plan a 
vacation -- things totally unrelated to his performance," he said. "Some 
younger people tend to disassociate for a while and fantasize that they're in 
the last mile of an Olympic final. It can be a whole mishmash of thinking to 
get over the repetitive boredom." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion swimmer Janet Evans never knows what thought will materialize 
during long training swims. "When we're doing a really long set in training," 
she said, "sometimes you set a pace and let your mind drift, like to how much 
homework I have to do when I get home, what happened during the day. It gets 
boring to think about swimming during a workout. Sometimes I'll think of things 
that happened a long time ago. They'll just suddenly be there. When I train 
with my teammates, all of a sudden -- I don't know why -- I'll think about a 
meet or something that we were at that happened a year ago -- just a random 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
The mental meanderings may be largely unexplainable, Evans said, but "I like 
it. It gives me a chance to be myself and work a lot of things out in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
A running regimen has a similar effect on Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). Long a 
devotee of running, Cranston said he is primarily a sprinter, but sometimes 
uses one- and two-mile runs to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to use that as relaxation and as an escape from work and 
responsibilities," he said. "Now and then, if there's some problem I haven't 
figured out, I may get an inspiration about how to deal with it. The human mind 
works that way, when you let it work subconsciously." 
</P>
<P>
Disassociative thinking in repetitive exercise may be almost instinctual, John 
Jerome wrote in his book "Staying With It: On Becoming an Athlete." 
</P>
<P>
"Primitive societies," he wrote, "know there is considerable power in rhythmic, 
repetitive physical action -- as in nonstop dancing -- to affect the mood, if 
not to move the consciousness into mysterious regions." 
</P>
<P>
The late Jim Fixx, a prime mover in the '70s running boom, wrote in his "The 
Complete Book of Running" that "while writing two books on games, puzzles and 
human intelligence I often solved problems as I ran. It was hard work (I'm not 
much good at doing math without pencil and paper), but if I concentrated, I 
could usually accomplish something. The kind of thinking I most like to do 
while I run, though, is just to let my thoughts wander wherever they wish." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the same as the "runner's high," usually ascribed to a release of 
natural, pleasure-inducing endorphins in the brain after a certain level of 
exertion has been reached. Disassociation, runners and others report, is more 
like daydreaming. 
</P>
<P>
There are times, however, when athletes must concentrate to avoid injury or to 
improve their performance. 
</P>
<P>
"You disassociate through a lot of your training," said Olympic champion 
marathoner Frank Shorter. But "in competitions, you don't. There, 
disassociating is not an advantage. When people try to take their minds off an 
activity, they're not the ones who are going to be best at doing it. The elite 
runners think about where they are, what their effort is, how they're doling it 
out, what their competition is." 
</P>
<P>
Recreational running, however, "is completely thinking about things that don't 
affect performance at all," Rushall said. "The people running in the back of 
the pack in a marathon are building houses in their minds and thinking about 
how people are going to be so surprised that they're in a marathon. But the 
elite runner is really working on the ingredients that fine-tune his running." 
</P>
<P>
In competitive team sports, where the mind must stay focused even in practice, 
that discipline often remains, even in repetitive training, two Los Angeles 
Rams said. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how you feel about your body," said safety Vince Newsome. "If 
you don't care too much about it, you don't have to work out as hard and you 
can let your mind wander. But for an athlete, even if you don't have to 
concentrate on what you're doing, somewhere in the back of your mind you're 
always kind of concerned, because you don't want to get terribly out of shape." 
</P>
<P>
During heavy training, said linebacker Brett Faryniarz, "you concentrate on 
what you're doing. You have to concentrate when you're working with weights if 
you want the results." 
</P>
<P>
Still, said Newsome, "your mind can go off different places and can either help 
you with your lifting or it can hurt you. When some people lift, they think 
about their opponent, but some think about a problem they're having at home. 
Each individual has his own method or thought process." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Evans said, a little artificial stimulus to the imagination can't 
hurt: "You'll see a lot of swimmers listening to Walkmans before they swim. 
They'll be fast songs that are kind of uplifting. In the race, your mind will 
be focused the whole time, but there'll be this song you'll be singing in your 
head. Swimmers will talk to each other later and say, 'Hey, guess what song I 
was singing during that race.' It's really weird." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's necessary to keep the mind engaged for no other reason than 
one's personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Leach of Irvine, who competed with his wife, Julie, in kayaking events at 
the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976 and now competes in triathlons, warned that 
"it's very scary to let your mind wander when you're on a bike, because you 
could end up having a crash. Sometimes you have to almost force yourself to pay 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
John Rosmus, of Fullerton, an ultra-long-distance runner who completed 65 miles 
of a 125-mile dash across Death Valley early this summer, said that in 
potentially dangerous situations, "you pretty much think about what's going on 
inside your body and how you're feeling from mile to mile. You think about 
where the next aid is coming up. You're monitoring yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep your mind on the trail and watch for rocks and things," said 
Rosmus, who intends to try his trans-desert transit again. "Otherwise you'll be 
falling all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Still, said Rosmus, when the path levels and grows monotonous, "you think about 
things that are just off the wall, just day-to-day things. Sometimes you can't 
figure out what you've seen in the last 10 miles. You've covered the ground but 
you don't know how you've gotten there." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of fatigue, Evans said, can cause the mind to wander as easily as the 
more relaxing atmosphere of an easy workout: "During a really hard set, where 
we've been going for a long time at about 95% or 100% effort, you have to get 
your mind off swimming and you can get these random thoughts. It's almost like 
you're delirious." 
</P>
<P>
In extremely long, sustained efforts, Rushall said it is essential for athletes 
to pull their minds away from the task, at least for a while. In advising 
competitors in the grueling Iditarod sled dog races in Alaska, Rushall suggests 
that they think about "how their sled is running, how the dogs are doing. But 
when they come to, say, an eight-mile flat stretch they should disassociate, 
take a mental vacation. They should think of how beautiful the scenery is and 
how it's quite a nice place to be and break off from the sled racing itself." 
</P>
<P>
The ability to disassociate doesn't come instantly, Shorter said. Those who are 
out of shape, when embarking on a repetitive training regimen, won't be 
thinking about twittering birds and sylvan glades after a mile or so. 
</P>
<P>
They will be thinking about fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not in good shape to begin with, there's an intellectualization that 
you have to go through," Shorter said. "You have to rely on faith. It's that 
faith that will take you through those first two months to the point where 
it'll be more enjoyable. There's a certain base level of conditioning that you 
have to get to before you can start to not think too much about what's going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
When Julie Leach of Irvine reached that stage, she went straight past it, into 
the realm in which she concentrated on every aspect of her workout, not only 
for kayaking but for triathlons. She got so good at it that she won the women's 
division of the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii in 1982. Today she is a 
recreational runner and cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
In recreational efforts, she said, "you don't need to concentrate on the 
workout and be really serious about it. You can be imaginative. My advice would 
be not to concentrate on things like 'This really hurts' or 'This is really 
hard.' You can mentally control yourself so much by what you suggest to 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
And with such thoughts, said her husband Bill, comes the real payoff -- those 
times when the mind is freewheeling, at peace "and you're really relaxed. The 
time goes by and you're not conscious of it. You feel very comfortable. It's 
those times you relish, because that's what it's all about. You're looking for 
that feeling of effortless effort. It's a feeling that's almost euphoric. It's 
almost a bigger-than-life feeling."

HIGH HOLY DAYS 'SCHLEP' RAISES OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I strongly object to the article "A Fun 'Schlep' for a Higher Holy Service" 
(Sept. 28) appearing on the eve of the holiest day in the Jewish faith, Yom 
Kippur. In case the readers missed the impact on the first page, they were 
reminded of the subject by the headline on the continuation page: "Jewish: 
Having Fun 'Schlepping' in Temples." 
</P>
<P>
In these days of increased racial and religious distrust of each other, The 
Times has demeaned this momentous holiday by celebrating the cuteness of one 
writer's so-called quest. 
</P>
<P>
Yom Kippur is a day in which we evaluate our past year's deeds and thoughts, 
ask for forgiveness, and then plan to create a better life for ourselves, our 
family and the greater community. 
</P>
<P>
I believe it would benefit us all -- Jew, Christian, Moslem -- to spend at 
least one day a year away from the pressures of everyday life, contemplate what 
we have wrought, and seek solutions to the problems that plague our world.

HIGH HOLY DAYS 'SCHLEP' RAISES OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Feldman's article on his search for the wildest, craziest High Holy Day 
services in L. A. is an unprecedented trivialization and vulgarization of 
Jewish observances. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Mr. Feldman "can't get no satisfaction." He thinks going to synagogue 
is like going to the circus. Among his freak show of deviant rabbis, he lists 
"a woman rabbi," presumably to distinguish her from "normal" rabbis who are 
invariably male. 
</P>
<P>
When Good Friday and Easter arrive, will The Times commission a comparably 
voyeuristic survey of off-beat Christian rites? Or might we perhaps agree that 
any worship a community offers up in deep earnest deserves to be reported with 
respect?

HIGH HOLY DAYS 'SCHLEP' RAISES OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Feldman, like so many other Jews, tends to concentrate on the High Holy 
Days as the focal point of Judaism. He therefore seeks the perfect place to 
spend a few hours once a year in pursuit of a "meaningful experience." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately this is not possible. 
</P>
<P>
Please do not think that I wish to demean his attendance at High Holy Day 
services. Rather, I congratulate his participation. However, I believe that the 
satisfaction a person derives from a religious service comes principally from 
within him or herself, not from the trappings of the place it is conducted or 
the individuals conducting the service. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, my frustration with Feldman is my belief that a temple 
is more than just a place to conduct a High Holy Day service. It is a place 
dedicated to the education of adults and children, to addressing social action 
programs, to helping people in time of need, to celebrating births, to mourning 
deaths and to serving the needs of the community at large. 
</P>
<P>
To maximize the spiritual benefit one derives from the temple, one must 
affiliate with, actively participate in, and help form the spiritual and social 
mind-set of that temple. Affiliation is the key word. Not attendance.

<P>
Leaders of the California thoroughbred racing fraternity opened the fall season 
at Santa Anita this week in the Directors Room with a lavish luncheon prepared 
by executive chef Tony Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Clement L. Hirsch who conceived the idea for Oak Tree -- begun in 1969 as a 
non-dividend paying association to foster research, care and breeding of 
thoroughbreds -- officially began his 22nd season as Oak Tree president. His 
wife Lynn, Los Angeles and Orange County civic leader, was by his side. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the crowd was the newest member of the board, Sherwood C. Chillingworth 
of Pasadena and his wife, Sandra. He's the first addition to the board since 
the deaths of founding directors Harold C. Ramser Sr. and Louis R. Rowan, more 
than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
At their table, the Hirsches hosted the chief executives of the two most 
successful race tracks (parimutuel-wise) in the country -- Joseph W. Harper, 
president and general manager of Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, and Robert P. 
Strub, chairman and CEO of Los Angeles Turf Club, and their wives, Barbara 
Harper and and Betty Strub. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling from San Diego for the affair were John and Betty Mabee. Mabee 
campaigns one of the ranking 2-year-olds in the nation, Best Pal, winner of the 
$344,100 Del Mar Futurity, in his Golden Eagle Farm colors. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the crowd were Georgia Ridder, Dr. Jack and Maggie Robbins, Anabeth and 
John J. Elmore Jr. of Newport Beach, Diane and Harry Rinker of Santa Ana, Betty 
Ramser with Hal and Amalia Ramser, and Oscar and Alice Lawler. 
</P>
<P>
ROYAL: Dudley Moore entertains and Roger Moore hosts when the British Academy 
of Film and Television Arts hosts a royal gala evening to honor Michael Caine 
in the presence of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra -- she is the daughter 
of the duke and duchess of Kent and Queen Elizabeth II's first cousin -- on 
Friday at the Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
It's a three-way split for proceeds: Childhelp USA, Children's Home Society and 
the academy's Los Angeles chapter. According to chapter president Marion 
Rosenberg, absolutely no cameras will be allowed into the banquet because of 
restrictions by the British Consulate and royal protocol. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Alexandra is here for the South Coast Plaza Festival of Britain and 
the opening of the British and the Oscar Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
BLACK-TIE: As the new chairman of the board of trustees of Harvey Mudd College 
and to bond the trustees for the challenges that lie ahead, Clifford A. Miller, 
with his wife Judith, hosted trustees and spouses at a dinner-dance Upstairs at 
the Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also was a tribute to retiring chairman, E. H. (Hubie) Clark, who 
will remain a trustee. Among guests were Norman and Erlenne Sprague, Richard 
and Marjorie Stegemeier, the college president Henry Riggs and his wife Gayle, 
Patricia Clark, Alexander and Adelaide Hixon and Robert Hastings and his 
frequent date Phyllis Diller. More there -- Michael Morphy with Allegra Clark, 
Trude and Joan Taylor, Jim Kilroy, Robert and Louisa Miller, Marian Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
BLACK-SHOE: Invitations arrived in a black tap shoe when the Dance Gallery 
Guild hosted its "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" opening evening. Co-chairwomen 
Patti Amstutz and Ruth Moss arranged the champagne supper after the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
SUCCESSES: More than 500 celebrities and supporters turned out for the 
fund-raising brunch for the Rape Foundation hosted by the cast of the TV 
series, "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. Law" stars Susan Dey and Corbin Bernsen and actress Kelly McGillis were 
among those honored for the center's documentary film for college students, 
"Campus Rape." The center has distributed the film to more than half the U. S. 
universities, according to Gail Abarbanel, center director. 
</P>
<P>
The brunch was at Greenacres, Ted and Susie Field's estate. Hosted by 
Emmy-winning actresses Dana Delany and Marg Helgenberger and other "China 
Beach" cast members, the event garnered about $200,000. Giving support were 
Veronica Hamel, Jaclyn Smith, David Niven Jr., Norman and Lyn Lear, Sherry 
Lansing, Heather Thomas, Judith Light and Linda and Bob Gersch. 
</P>
<P>
BIG NIGHT: Santa Marta Hospital Foundation's Oct. 24 ball at the Beverly 
Wilshire will support the only Latino-owned and operated hospital in the United 
States. Because of its work with the poor in East Los Angeles, the hospital is 
attracting the attention of prominent Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
To be feted that night are Sister Marie Madeleine of Saint John's Hospital and 
Health Center, Reva and William Tooley and Santa Marta's hospital medical 
staff. Among those supporting are Lois and Robert Erburu, Alice and Jerve 
Jones, Wilma and Robert Campion, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Howard Allen, Jane 
and Michael Eisner and Earle and Marion Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
EXTRA TREATS: Platinum Circle guests at the third annual Frank Sinatra 
Celebrity Invitational golf tournament in Palm Desert Feb. 21-23 will have the 
extra treat of attending a post-gala at the Sinatra Rancho Mirage home. 
</P>
<P>
Ol' Blue Eyes headlines the gala and can be counted on for a few nightcap songs 
at the party. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum Circle reservations are a mere $10,000, but it's for a superb cause -- 
the Desert Hospital and the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center at Eisenhower 
Medical Center at Rancho Mirage . . . . 
</P>
<P>
And, speaking of treats, Halloween looms. The Los Angeles Children's Museum's 
premiere group, The Inner Circle, hosts its annual Halloween Fashion Show and 
Luncheon next Sunday at the Beverly Hilton. Saks Fifth Avenue will garb the 
ladies on the ramp -- including honoree Jaclyn Smith, Inner Circle's president 
Carol Walker and executive vice president Esther Rosenfield. The children of 
stars will be in hot costumes from "Costumes for Kids" on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>

HOT LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE LAND OF FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENTS LIVE MILES AWAY AND RIDE A NON-AIR-CONDITIONED BUS IN 115- 
TO 125-DEGREE HEAT TO GET TO CLASSES. DEATH VALLEY HIGH IS THE COMMUNITY'S 
CENTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
There will be no senior prom at the local high school this year. 
</P>
<P>
No boys. The seniors are all girls. 
</P>
<P>
And they decided not to elect class officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to hurt anybody's feelings by competing against one another," 
explained Jean Stotts, 17. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three seniors -- Stotts, Darby Watterson, 18, and Valerie Holms, 
18. 
</P>
<P>
Death Valley High School in this tiny Inyo county town has a total of 16 
students -- seven boys and nine girls. Besides the seniors, there are five 
juniors, four sophomores and four freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
For six years, Death Valley has been the only high school in the state that 
holds classes four days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a special act of the state Legislature to get the four-day-a-week 
program, to save money and to reduce student bus travel time through some of 
the hottest country on earth," explained Frank Behnke, 64, principal of Death 
Valley High and one of the school's four teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Shoshone, population 75, is 15 miles east of Death Valley National Monument and 
20 miles west of the Nevada state line by way of Charley Brown Highway. The 
nearest city of any size to Shoshone is Las Vegas, 90 miles southeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
Students who live 60 miles away at Furnace Creek in Death Valley catch the bus 
at 6 a.m. to arrive 1 1/2 hours later at school. The bus travels through the 
Funeral Mountains and Resting Spring Range. School is out at 3:45 p.m. and 
students who live at Furnace Creek get home at 5:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures have been a sizzling 115 to 125 degrees the first month of school. 
"The bus doesn't have air conditioning. It's like sitting in a furnace," 
Watterson said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Death Valley High has had girls volleyball, boys and girls 
cross-country, and boys basketball teams. But this year, the entire sports 
program is on hold. The physical education teacher quit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a new P.E. teacher. Because of the remoteness of this little 
town, we have a hard time finding teachers," noted Robert Williams, 66, 
superintendent of the school district, which includes a high school, junior 
high (five boys, two girls), an elementary school (30 students) in Shoshone and 
another elementary school (30 students) at Furnace Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Death Valley High does have a newspaper, the Scorpion Stinger, and a yearbook, 
Tomesha, a Shoshone Indian word meaning, appropriately, "Land of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 16 high school students are Shoshones, a tiny band of Indians who 
live in Death Valley National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
Scorpion is a nickname of the school athletic teams when the school has 
athletic teams. Another appropriate name. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is alive with scorpions," said Ken Smith, 47, a teacher here for 20 
years. The other two high school teachers are Dan Simmons, 46, here four years 
and Vaughn Talsness, 42, who just started teaching this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Death Valley High has existed for 33 years, and it is the center of this 
community. Academically, its students do "as well, if not better, than those 
attending much larger high schools," said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
He credited the individual attention each student receives and said nearly 
every graduate, year in and year out, goes on to college. The three seniors 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Students don't fall through the cracks at Death Valley High," Holms said. 
"It's not in one ear and out the other in our classes," added Watterson. "You 
learn more in a little school like this," Stotts chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
At Death Valley High, "Every student knows everybody in school on a first name 
basis," observed junior Bryan Barkley, 15.

ZAN THOMPSON: ALL THE WORLD'S IN LOVE ON HILTON HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fish leaped, making a silver arc over the waters of the Inland Waterway on 
Hilton Head Island, S.C. Then it did it again. Some people said it was a 
mullet, some thought a trout. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever finny visitor, it had the best view of all of the wedding guests. 
Everyone else looked at the backs of the bride and groom. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding was on a boat dock leading out to the pavilion of Hilton Head 
Plantation, and the guests were standing and seated on the benches of the 
pavilion overlooking the water. 
</P>
<P>
The bride was Mandy Thomas, daughter of my sister Patsy and Col. Frank C. 
Thomas. I met Mandy when she was 4 years old, her sister Muff was 3 and their 
baby brother, Bo, was 2. Bo was called that because that's as close as his 
sisters could get to pronouncing brother when they were smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Mandy was a beautiful child with turquoise eyes and black hair, as feminine as 
a lace fan even when she was plotting the destruction of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Mandy, Muff and Bo. Patsy, their mother, always said it sounded as if they were 
a team of cocker spaniels. Mandy's name is Amanda, Muff's is Alexandria and Bo 
is named for his father. 
</P>
<P>
His father was a fighter pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps known as Tommy. He left 
Patsy and the three resourceful children in my husband Doug's care when he went 
to Korea. 
</P>
<P>
And when he came back, Bo was baptized with Doug as his godfather. I was always 
godmother to all the kids to my delight. There were only rare occasions when I 
despaired of the responsibility of these three beautiful, inventive children. 
What one didn't think of, another one did. 
</P>
<P>
They grew up in Marine Air Stations throughout the United States, going to 
dozens of schools. They were class presidents, student body presidents, track 
team champions, song leaders, team leaders. When they changed schools, Patsy 
always told them that the new kids were just friends they hadn't met yet. 
That's why they have friends all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Mandy married a handsome man named Robert James Petrie who has a warm, friendly 
family from New York. All of the out-of-towners stayed in a large house on 
Hilton Head with an ever-changing cast of characters as people came and went. 
</P>
<P>
The day of the wedding the bride and the groom dashed back and forth on errands 
-- shoes for Mandy and Bob, hurricane chimneys for the centerpieces, a new 
blazer for Patrick, Mandy's second son. 
</P>
<P>
When we were all assembled, we were a credible group. The bride and groom 
together with six children by former marriages. The kids marched in together: 
Lance, Missy, Cassidy, Jack, Patrick and Katie. 
</P>
<P>
Muff stood with Mandy and Bob's brother, Edward, was best man. Mandy's son 
Jack, handsome in his Camden Military Institute uniform, gave her away. 
Cassidy, Missy and Katie wore white and were wonderful, surely not the girls 
who just two days before were claiming that there was not a dress on all of 
Hilton Head Island that was fit to wear to a dogfight, much less a wedding. 
</P>
<P>
At the reception, there were toasts, tears, laughter, music and the groom 
played his guitar superbly and sang in a mellow baritone. 
</P>
<P>
I had liked him instantly and when he began to play and sing, I knew he was the 
right one. 
</P>
<P>
There were random silver rain showers all weekend, but at the hour of the 
wedding, the sun was out and scattering golden coins on the water and the 
inquisitive fish. 
</P>
<P>
It was a beautiful wedding for a daughter I could not love more if she were my 
own and the man I would have selected for her if anyone had let me. 
</P>
<P>
It was a happy time with people I love. There were a few gaps in the ranks that 
hurt no more than saber wounds. That's why this one is for Patsy and Tommy and 
Doug. Don't worry, kids, Bob's wonderful and Mandy is a happy girl. We all done 
good. You'd have all been proud of us.

HUNDREDS OF WOMEN COVER SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fewer than half a dozen women writers covered professional football, baseball, 
basketball and hockey in early 1970 and none were allowed in the locker rooms 
to interview players. But by the mid-'70s, matters had changed, at least in 
hockey and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey reporter Robin Herman of the New York Times probably was the first 
female journalist to interview players in the locker room while covering the 
New York Islanders in 1973-74, said Tracy Dodds, vice president of the Assn. 
for Women in Sports Media. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the AWSM has almost 400 sportswriter members covering professional and 
college sports, Dodds said, adding, "there are another 300 to 400 out there." 
</P>
<P>
There had been few "reported" locker room problems for women until the Sept. 17 
incident involving New England Patriot players and Boston Herald football 
reporter Lisa Olson. "But I guarantee you, somewhere today, in college or pros, 
some woman is being verbally abused and humiliated" in a locker room, said 
Dodds, of the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the National Hockey League became the first pro sports organization to 
institute an "equal access" policy for male and female sportswriters. NHL 
locker rooms are open to accredited writers up to 90 minutes before games. 
After games there is a 10-minute "cooling-off period" before the press is 
permitted in the locker room, said the NHL's Michael Berger. 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball League developed "an open-door, equal-access policy" 
for reporters in the mid-'70s, said the NBA's Terry Lyons. "We have simple 
rules," he said, adding that the media are "allowed in (locker rooms) up until 
45 minutes before a game. . . . We also have the 10-minute cooling-off period 
after a game and it's worked quite well. We've had no incidents and no fines." 
</P>
<P>
Major league baseball and the National Football League held out as "male only" 
locker rooms until 1978 and 1985, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1977, Melissa Ludtke, then a Sports Illustrated reporter covering the 
New York Yankees in the World Series, was refused the clubhouse access given to 
male sportswriters. Ludtke, Sports Illustrated and its parent, Time Inc., sued 
the Yankees, alleging that Ludtke had suffered sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 25, 1978, a federal judge ruled that barring women writers from locker 
rooms violated the Constitution. She ordered the Yankees to protect players' 
privacy while allowing equal access to male and female reporters. (The judge 
suggested towels might help.) 
</P>
<P>
In pro baseball, the league media policy allows all reporters access 
"immediately after games," said a spokesman for the commissioner who did not 
recall "in recent memory" fines for noncompliance. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1985, NFL clubs developed their own policies on female reporters in 
locker rooms. Since then, league policy allows locker room access to all 
accredited reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But Cincinnati Bengals coach Sam Wyche, who barred USA Today sports reporter 
Denise Tom from his team's locker room after its Oct. 1 loss to the Seahawks in 
Seattle, was fined $3,000 by the league last year for barring all reporters 
from the locker room after another Seattle loss. Wyche also received a 1988 
warning from former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle for limiting locker room 
access. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tagliabue, the current commissioner, has said he will fine Wyche heavily 
for the Monday incident. Tagliabue also has appointed a Harvard Law School 
professor as special counsel to investigate Olson's sexual harassment 
allegations against the Patriots.

HOME-IMPROVEMENT VIDEOS ASSIST THE VIEW-IT-YOURSELFER

Home repair was strictly learn-as-you-go when I was a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, my father would get out the tool chest and attack a squeaky door, 
leaky faucet or stuck window in what he dubbed a "curse-and-bleed" operation. 
</P>
<P>
That is, the job was not complete until he had split a thumb or dropped 
something heavy on his toe, sending him stumbling for the medicine cabinet, 
cursing loudly. 
</P>
<P>
When my husband, Larry, and I bought a fixer house in 1983, we thought we were 
smarter than old Dad. We acquired a thick stack of home-improvement books, so 
we could read about our projects before tackling them. We scrutinized 
complicated charts and pondered hundreds of pages of often-confusing text in 
our quest for home-repair knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Despite our efforts, many a curse was uttered, many a Band-Aid needed. Three 
years and many mistakes later, the house was finished; the hefty home-repair 
manuals now occupy a shelf in our living room bookcase, where they look quite 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, just as technology took exercise out of the gym and onto the Jane 
Fonda tape, a new form of instruction for the would-be do-it-yourselfer has 
emerged: the home-improvement video. 
</P>
<P>
Home improvement on video generally resembles home improvement in real life, 
with several important differences. On video, almost nobody sweats. They don't 
rip or stain their clothes. They don't make mistakes, and their neighbors don't 
scream at them for running the electric saw late at night. 
</P>
<P>
Most unrealistically, they never have to go back to the hardware store, and no 
one ever pays for anything. Naturally, a certain suspension of disbelief is 
necessary to concentrate on the home repairs shown on the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Will home-improvement videos ever replace the printed word and picture for the 
home handyperson? Unlikely. In fact, most of the tapes come with booklets or 
books, or at least a disclaimer advising that their video may not demonstrate 
everything you need to know. 
</P>
<P>
When Larry and I wanted to learn a new skill, we would hire a professional who 
would let us observe and assist. A good how-to video is like having a 
professional over to your house, except the video can be rewound and watched 
again -- and it doesn't charge another $50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Home-improvement videos started to appear in the early 1980s, but most of the 
videos on the market today have come out within the last three years. The field 
is dominated by two series, both of which have the promotional advantage of 
being aired as weekly television shows: The Do-It-Yourself Show and The 
Hometime Show. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy people," said Do-It-Yourself company President Robert Roskins, and 
no wonder -- he claims the series is selling 250,000 copies a year at $19.95 a 
pop. "Hometime" host Dean Johnson won't reveal sales figures, but says his 
series is carried in 6,000 retail outlets, and is doing "real well." 
</P>
<P>
The Do-It-Yourself Show (D-Y-I) and tapes are hosted by professionals Curt 
Burbick and Avian Rogers. They are capable, friendly and relaxed on camera. 
They also clearly love their work, and their enthusiasm as they build a garage 
or knock down a load-bearing wall is downright inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 episodes available on tape are usually 30 minutes long, and always well 
organized, scripted and shot. Larry points out that the show doesn't always 
have enough detail for a novice, but for folks who already know their way 
around a 4-foot level, these tapes are just the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The hosts of the "Hometime Show" are former hardware distributor Dean Johnson 
and former journalist JoAnne Liebeler. They're not pros, but the show is 
scrupulously accurate, with elaborate descriptions and plenty of nice big 
close-ups. If you've never hung a picture in your life, this series is for you. 
</P>
<P>
The 36 mostly hourlong tapes are sponsored by Chevrolet. This doesn't mean 
there's a Chevy logo at the beginning of each tape, but Dean and JoAnne go to 
the hardware store in a Chevy Astro, raving about the van all the way there and 
back. Luckily, our VCR has the double-quick fast forward speed. 
</P>
<P>
Video budgets range from shoestring to elaborate, special effects from humble 
hand-drawn charts to flashy computer-generated graphics. The Hometime Show has 
a more expensive look than the Do-It-Yourself Show. 
</P>
<P>
But dollars alone don't make a good video. As I viewed more than 60 of the 
tapes currently on the market, I developed the requisite "Four Reals" -- real 
professionals do real repairs on real homes in real big close-up shots. 
Generally, the more educational and enjoyable videos provide the Four Reals. 
</P>
<P>
The presence -- or absence -- of "Reals" figures prominently in my notes about 
each home-improvement tape reviewed below. The reviews are grouped by type of 
repair, and listed alphabetically within each category (not necessarily best 
tape first). 
</P>
<P>
I haven't rated the tapes, because what's good for a beginner isn't always good 
for a more experienced renovator. There isn't room for all 36 Hometime and 27 
Do-It-Yourself episodes, but I've included key examples of each series. 
</P>
<P>
I made Larry watch a number of the tapes, and his comments reflect his 
experience as a remodeler and television associate producer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carpentry 
</P>
<P>
Fine Homebuilding Workshop -- "Basic Stairbuilding," "Installing Doors and 
Windows," "Installing Trim," "Making Kitchen Cabinets" 
</P>
<P>
These tapes are the Rolls-Royce of home-improvement video -- thorough, clear 
and well-shot. Producer Taunton Press has chosen an expert in each field to 
host the tape on their specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Check out "Trim" video host Craig Savage as he makes short work of cope-edged 
joints. Or thrill to the workmanship of Scott Schuttner in the elaborate 
stair-building video. These tapes have all you need to know, from the basics to 
inspiring advanced projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Finish Carpentry" 
</P>
<P>
Dean and JoAnne tackle simple stuff, such as installing a door/jamb assembly 
and installing molding for windows, doors, baseboards and ceilings. Then they 
spiral off into remodeling fairyland, making their own fireplace mantel, 
stairs, banisters, folding double doors and wainscoting. Fascinating to watch, 
but don't try this at home. 
</P>
<P>
Increase Video -- "Woodworking" 
</P>
<P>
This tape begins with a lengthy explanation of how to hold a piece of plywood. 
Then, without measuring anything, host Bob McKelvey saws many pieces of wood, 
while his voice on the sound track intones such sage advice as "Corneal 
injuries are not something you can ignore." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he assembles a cabinet in the murky darkness of his workshop, while 
he talks to an unseen person off camera. Though he seems knowledgeable, 
McKelvey just isn't having any fun. Neither did I. 
</P>
<P>
You Can Do It Videos -- "Install a Pre-Hung Door," "Constructing Stud Walls," 
"Principles of Paneling" 
</P>
<P>
Host George Giangrante brings his friend Lou along to show us how to do basic 
carpentry projects in these three tapes. George seems to know what he's doing, 
but the camera is placed far, far away from the action. 
</P>
<P>
George glues up a piece of plywood, then checks to see if it's level. This is a 
prescription for disaster when a novice goes to work. On the positive side, 
this series is the only one closed captioned for the hearing impaired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decks 
</P>
<P>
Better Homes &amp; Gardens 
</P>
<P>
This tape kills my interest with corny dialogue from our actor "couple." She: 
"You know, I figure that our new deck will cost less than last summer's 
vacation!" He: "You know, that's what I call a bargain." Confusing explanations 
of how to build the deck follow. 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y 
</P>
<P>
Curt and Avian build a simple deck at Avian's house. They cover all the basic 
steps -- pier blocks, joists, decking, rails. I liked the fast pace and 
real-life situation; Larry felt it skipped over too much. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime 
</P>
<P>
After extensive planning, Dean and JoAnne build a deck from scratch. It's all 
here, in glorious close-ups. They even show how to build the joists. The tape 
is full of great tips, such as which side of the lumber goes up, and the 3-4-5 
measuring shortcut. They tackle a two-level deck with a cantilevered section, 
and lay diagonal deck planks -- a little ambitious for the average homeowner. I 
found the tape a bit plodding, but Larry liked the detailed explanations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drywall 
</P>
<P>
Best of Wally's Workshop 
</P>
<P>
Former "What's My Line" host Wally Bruner was a pioneer of home-improvement 
video, but unfortunately, his 90-minute tapes are long on corn pone and short 
on clear instructions. No surprise the 24-tape series is hard to find; I came 
across a couple installments at a 20/20 Video store. 
</P>
<P>
Wally and wife Natalie inexplicably dress and act like they're on the set of 
"The Wonder Years." Wally does offer some helpful hints -- borrow tools from 
your neighbors instead of buying them -- but there are no close-ups as Wally 
tries in vain to smooth the joint mud. 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y 
</P>
<P>
In this thorough tape, our hosts drywall an attic space, including a round 
turret! It doesn't get any harder than that. Larry goes crazy when they use 
lipstick on the electrical box and then press the drywall up against it, neatly 
marking where to cut. "I wish I'd known that," he mutters. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime 
</P>
<P>
Larry put up lots of drywall at our house, and he liked this tape the best. 
They don't skip the hard parts, like how to get the seams really smooth. Dean 
and JoAnne warn that beginners should stay away from flat ceilings. "Too late," 
moans Larry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electrical 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y 
</P>
<P>
The action takes place in an eerie black set, but the content is good, as Avian 
and Curt install plugs, switches and light fixtures with lots of close-ups and 
explanations. They also add an outlet and add circuits to their fuse box. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime 
</P>
<P>
Dean and JoAnne cover every imaginable basic electrical project in this 
65-minute tape. Some of it's over my head, but if you watch long enough, you'll 
probably find the exact thing you want to learn. Beware though, they're working 
on a set. 
</P>
<P>
"In a real house," as Dean explains, lots of things will be different. And walt 
a minute -- they hire a pro to work on their fuse box. Wimps! 
</P>
<P>
Made Easy Series 
</P>
<P>
Our hosts Shelby Grimm and Julie Morgan don't introduce themselves, and we soon 
learn why. While strange, throbbing synthesizer music plays in the background, 
they explain basic electrical repairs with a "See Spot Run" approach. 
</P>
<P>
"If the light glows, stop," Shelby says. "The current is not off. Go turn it 
off." There's no tough stuff, like adding an outlet or roughing-in new 
circuits. And there's no way to stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
Ortho Information Series 
</P>
<P>
Our host, Thayer Walker, chats with us in a kitchen, drinks coffee and explains 
this series is for "ordinary people, the average homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the tape is populated not with average homeowners, but with 
below-average actors, who have awkward conversations about their lives while 
they perform basic home repairs. Why should I believe these drama students are 
doing it right? Mercifully, the actors are not credited by sequence, so you 
can't tell who was responsible for any particular embarrassing scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Repairs 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y 
</P>
<P>
This tape covers plumbing, electrical and weatherizing repairs. There's basic 
pipe soldering, replacing a cracked tile, fixing squeaky boards, plaster cracks 
and other basic home repairs. But the electrical repairs confused me; I don't 
think I would understand them without seeing their electrical tape first. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime 
</P>
<P>
Probably the best one-stop tape. Every subject is covered in detail. They don't 
just install a switch -- they install one-, three- and even four-way switches. 
The same thorough treatment is given to plumbing repairs, stuck windows, 
sagging doors, flawed plaster, ripped wallpaper, squeaky floors, and marred 
vinyl flooring. Whew! 
</P>
<P>
Reader's Digest Videomanual: Home Repair 
</P>
<P>
A disembodied arm and a headless man perform an exhaustive series of plumbing, 
electrical and other general home repairs in this video. You could probably 
learn a lot here -- if you could tolerate the "You're-a-moron" explanations. 
This one's even boring in fast-forward. 
</P>
<P>
This Old House 
</P>
<P>
Bob Vila's home improvement series is probably the best known, but this tape is 
the only episode currently available. I was surprised to find that 
home-improvement legend Vila delegates a lot of the work to helpers. The tape 
is well shot and scripted, and full of good tips, like putting soap on screws 
for easy drilling and the old lipstick trick. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the usual electric and plumbing repairs, we see track lighting 
installed, windowpane replacement, a door lock, rain gutters, floor refinishing 
and more. A good demo of a brick walkway shows the step we left out -- pouring 
sand or stone dust into the bed to prevent grass from sprouting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Security 
</P>
<P>
Best of Wally's Workshop 
</P>
<P>
Wally skips lots of steps installing a combination burglar/smoke alarm, 
including drilling the holes and threading the wires behind the wall. When 
Wally tests it, he can only get the smoke alarm part to work. With wires draped 
all over the set, he proudly announces, "This is the solution." "Yeah," Larry 
howls, "now you've got wire linguine all over your house." 
</P>
<P>
As a finale, the door lock Wally installed earlier pops open of its own accord 
-- and does not trigger the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Made Easy Series 
</P>
<P>
This silly tape doesn't have a single installation. They talk about storm 
windows, window locks, home safes, caulking, duct wraps -- but hey, how do we 
put them in? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kitchen Remodel 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y 
</P>
<P>
In this ambitious tape, our hosts destroy an old kitchen, then reframe the 
walls for new French doors, knock down a load-bearing wall, install new 
cabinets, and it all comes out looking great. Nothing may be too hard for them, 
but this is way beyond the average do-it-yourselfer's abilities. Sure is 
inspiring to watch though. 
</P>
<P>
Ortho Information Series 
</P>
<P>
The bad actors in this tape don't even bother to do many repairs. In one 
sequence, two men discuss but do not actually replace a sink. This tape does 
have the only demonstration I found of installing a greenhouse window. 
Unfortunately, a good deal of time is wasted while "Dad" explains to "Son" how 
much "Mom" is going to like her new window. 
</P>
<P>
In another section, a young couple lay out their new vinyl flooring on the 
driveway to measure it -- a great way to embed little pebbles in the backing, 
ruining the installation. "Is the flooring square?" she asks. He replies with 
the do-it-yourselfer's famous last words: "Looks square to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paint and Wallpaper 
</P>
<P>
Better Homes &amp; Gardens -- "Wallpaper Like A Pro" 
</P>
<P>
Our expert Leonardo Torrente is affable and knows what he's doing. His 
preparation is great, but once he starts hanging wallpaper, problems emerge. 
Demonstrations of how to trim around windows are badly shot, and the continuity 
is confusing -- first he's working toward the right, then suddenly he's moving 
to the left. He puts the first piece on a new wall and then checks to see if 
it's plumb -- sure disaster for a beginner. 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y -- "Interior Paint &amp; Wallpaper" 
</P>
<P>
This tape covers the basics well, but it's vexing when Avian paints a ceiling 
without getting little bits of paint on her face. 
</P>
<P>
Great Living Series -- "Paint Like a Professional" 
</P>
<P>
The disembodied arm returns in this for-beginners-only tape. The arm turns into 
a whole guy later, but we never learn who he is. This tape does attempt to 
settle the raging painter's controversy -- should you punch holes in the paint 
can rim or not? (If you do, the paint drips back into the can and keeps the lid 
from sticking. But the holes can let air in, causing the paint to harden. Their 
advice: Don't do it.) 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Interior Paint &amp; Wallpaper" 
</P>
<P>
This solid tape covers both paint and wallpaper. Good preparation, "cutting in" 
and a good wallpaper demonstration of trimming around a door. There's an 
interesting section on stenciling -- a simple way to brighten up a room. 
</P>
<P>
Increase Video -- "Professional Tips for Easy Wallpapering" 
</P>
<P>
In this 56-minute video, nervous Nancy Mitchell, a wallpapering professional, 
demonstrates the easy parts of how to hang wallpaper. After a long, dull 
explanation of what kind of paper and tools to use, she puts her first piece of 
paper up in the middle of a wall. As we approach a window, she puts up one 
piece, then presto! In the next shot, we're past the window. 
</P>
<P>
Made Easy Series -- "Paint &amp; Paper" 
</P>
<P>
This tape is a real cheater -- they paint a white ceiling white again. "Cutting 
in" paint, masking windows and wallpapering around doors all happen off camera. 
Their demonstration of sizing a wall is a close-up of the sizing can. 
</P>
<P>
U-Do-It-Yourself -- "Wallpaper" 
</P>
<P>
Producer Bruce Lamb brags "We think we've got the best do-it-yourself wallpaper 
tape on the market" at the beginning of this tape. While the program does 
demonstrate solutions to many wallpaper challenges, including doors, a casement 
window, an archway and a soffit, host Larry Camp has trouble thinking like a 
beginner. Pasting the wallpaper before cutting it is fine for a pro, but it's 
going to be a big mess when we try it at home. 
</P>
<P>
View-and-Do Videos -- "Paperhanging" 
</P>
<P>
This new video is a stultifying 117-minute epic. Professional Harry Davies, 
"wife and paperhanger" Louise and daughter Karrin are all stiff as 2-by-4s as 
they try to explain how to hang wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
The script is confusing and redundant: "Before you can prevent that from 
happening," Harry says, "you should know what causes it to happen." He explains 
further by pointing to an incomprehensible chart. 
</P>
<P>
Larry says, "This guy makes you want to call a professional!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plumbing 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y 
</P>
<P>
Curt and Avian start big, laying the plumbing for a whole house. But they're 
not in a real house -- it's that strange black set, with a few wall studs and 
no plaster. They make it look easy, but am I going to plumb my whole house? I 
think not. Later, they focus on repairs. Like many tapes, they demonstrate how 
to fix a toilet with a cutaway tank. I know it's hard to see in, but it still 
seems like a cheat. 
</P>
<P>
Fix-It Series 
</P>
<P>
The disclaimer at the front of this tape says producer Morris Video "is not 
claiming persons presented to be experts, nor do we endorse them or necessarily 
agree with them." Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Host and apparent non-expert Jerry Jones does a number of plumbing repairs 
without ever setting foot in a kitchen or bathroom. Faucets are mounted on 
little red-and-yellow boxes. He changes a shower head while holding the whole 
assembly in his hand. I think it's easy that way, Jerry, but what about when 
it's attached to a ceramic-tile wall? 
</P>
<P>
Hometime 
</P>
<P>
The best part of this tape is when computer graphics pop in to show you where 
the toilet and shower will be. Repairs are well covered, but the big "rough in" 
plumbing job is too confusing to follow. "We cut this pipe to the right 
length," Dean explains. But how do I know what that is? 
</P>
<P>
Made Easy Series 
</P>
<P>
In this tape, hosts Shelby Grimm and Julie Morgan dismantle many different 
plumbing fixtures, but reassemble almost none of them. They use a toilet 
diagram so silly that I now understand why most tapes use the cut-away tank. At 
the end of a typical repair, Julie chirps, "Now reassemble the faucet. It 
shouldn't leak." 
</P>
<P>
Larry laughed until he cried at that one. 
</P>
<P>
Ortho Information Series 
</P>
<P>
This tape wastes a lot of time on awkward chitchat and features stiff, stiff 
actors doing home repairs. There's one informative segment, when two lovable 
nerd-types fix the plumbing at their vacation home. Between the garish video 
lighting and the silly scripts, this series plays like a bad soap opera. (All 
My Home Repairs?) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Siding 
</P>
<P>
Build Your Own Series -- "Reside Your House" 
</P>
<P>
This tape is sponsored by the American Plywood Assn. Since the tape covers only 
plywood, and 90% of siding is redwood or cedar, what we learn here is of 
limited use. Safety is slipshod as well. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Siding" 
</P>
<P>
This tape features a good planning section and a good tip -- varnish the wood 
before you install it. Covers plywood panels, cedar shakes, and it offers a 
book bibliography in the accompanying "Project Guide" booklet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tile/Glass Block 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y -- "Ceramic Tile: Floors &amp; Counters" 
</P>
<P>
I watched the tile tapes with great interest, because we hired a contractor to 
tile our entry, and he messed up the job. After seeing how simple it is, I'm 
sorry we didn't do it ourselves. This tape has good coverage of the basics, but 
they don't tile a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Fine Homebuilding Video Workshop -- "Tiling Walls/Floors/Countertops" 
</P>
<P>
These three tapes are a tile-setting extravaganza! Host Michael Byrne doesn't 
just slap down some tile -- he uses careful planning to create the best layout, 
including a graceful curved section where two walls join. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne starts from scratch, installing several types of underlayment. He even 
demonstrates how to create a sloped shower floor. "You just can't get results 
like this out of a box," he notes. No kidding. The thinking man's tile tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Ceramic Tile" 
</P>
<P>
This tape explains why the tile in our house is coming up -- it didn't have the 
cement-like underlayment that keeps the surface rigid. They work in a variety 
of real situations, and even replace a broken tile. I love it when they do it 
wrong, and rechalk their lines. 
</P>
<P>
U-Do-It-Yourself -- "Glass Block" 
</P>
<P>
This is the only tape I found on installing glass block; luckily, it's quite 
serviceable. Producer/host Bruce Lamb is a little stiff, but his preparation is 
very thorough, with good advice on planning ahead to avoid problems. He 
actually adjusts a course of blocks to make them level, just like a real 
person. The script could use some streamlining, but he tells you what you need 
to know in a compact 30-minute tape. 
</P>
<P>
U-Tile-It-Yourself -- "Walls/ Floors/Counters" 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lamb has three tiling tapes to address each specific job. He demonstrates 
tiling an outdoor patio, then tiles over linoleum flooring in a kitchen. Each 
tape starts with a thorough demonstration of tools and good tile-cutting and 
planning tips. The pounding synthesizer music is a little weird, but Lamb makes 
the jobs look easy. 
</P>
<P>
I do get confused when Lamb shows how to create a sink surface for tiling, but 
once he's done, there's good advice on how to work with non-square walls. Lamb 
uses real house situations, and doesn't skip the hard parts, like cutting tiles 
to fit around shower pipes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wood Floors 
</P>
<P>
Fine Homebuilding Workshop -- "Sanding &amp; Finishing Hardwood Floors" 
</P>
<P>
This tape is the most disappointing of the series -- they finish a new floor, 
so it's hard to see the difference. Host Don Bollinger does create some gouges, 
and then shows you how to fix them. A most useful demonstration for amateurs to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Wood Flooring" 
</P>
<P>
Larry writhes at the thought of beginners gouging their wood floors, but I 
found this tape inspiring. Our hosts refinish a battered old floor from start 
to finish, and they don't shy away from the tough parts, like sanding under the 
radiator. The floor looks ravishing when they're finished. They don't show any 
floor repairs though. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Projects 
</P>
<P>
Build Your Own Series -- "Store-It-All Barn" 
</P>
<P>
Host Don Vandervort starts with an in-depth review of how plywood is made. You 
guessed it, it's another tape sponsored by the American Plywood Assn. My review 
copy came brand new in the cellophane, but had audio problems and fuzzy 
picture. What I could make out of Vandervort didn't make a lot of sense. He 
puts the barn together pretty neatly, but I don't think I could do it. 
</P>
<P>
D-I-Y -- "Garages" 
</P>
<P>
Have you been wanting to build a garage from scratch? Then this tape is for 
you. This special one-hour episode epitomizes our hosts philosophy -- almost 
nothing is beyond the abilities of a determined do-it-yourselfer. 
</P>
<P>
They do break down and hire a contractor to pour their concrete slab and put up 
the garage door. Curt and Avian divide the job into simple steps -- roof, 
walls, windows, doors, electrical -- and then, they do it all. Amazing, but 
beyond most remodelers' abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Three-Season Porch" 
</P>
<P>
This tape is also quite impressive, but far beyond the skills of most 
remodelers. Interesting camera work is used in a wonderful dream sequence where 
Dean agonizes over having ordered the roof trusses in the wrong size. When he 
wakes up, of course, he solves the problem. The planning is extensive, the 
explanations are expansive, and I'm sure the project is very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Give Up? 
</P>
<P>
Hometime -- "Contracting a Home" 
</P>
<P>
Has all this talk of doing it yourself made you want to melt down your tool 
chest? Then consider this option: Don't do it yourself, but save money by 
becoming your own general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
This staggering 10-part, two-tape miniseries is the "Gone With The Wind" of the 
do- it-yourself genre. We learn how to choose a site, read plans, get permits, 
find subcontractors, schedule (ha! ha!) -- all the steps you need to take your 
house from idea to move-in condition. 
</P>
<P>
You would think after viewing all these home-improvement videos, I could fix 
anything. But there's one drawback to learning from a video -- you have to find 
one that demonstrates your exact repair. And after watching more than 60 tapes, 
I didn't see a single one that shows this plumbing problem: When we turn on our 
bathroom sink's cold tap, it slowly turns itself off. The cursing and bleeding 
continues.MICHAEL EDWARDS / Los Angeles TimesPhoto styling by TRACY CROWE / Los

When it comes to housing, there's the new George Deukmejian and there's the old 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
In a bitter legislative battle in 1973, Deukmejian the assemblyman led the 
fight to oppose the creation of the California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA), 
which today offers discount mortgages to low- and middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
That was the old Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years later, the new Deukmejian pushed through a major first-time home 
buyer package that is expected to increase CHFA's funding by $1 billion in the 
next several years. 
</P>
<P>
When Edmund G. Brown Jr. was governor, the state housing department was riding 
roughshod over local elected officials who didn't want affordable housing. 
After the 1982 election, Deukmejian's transition team vowed that the state 
would no longer punish local government for shunning affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
That was the old Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The new Deukmejian signed a bill 10 days ago that forces local government to 
accept low-cost housing developments even when residents in the area don't want 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The old Deukmejian vetoed numerous housing bills during his first term as 
governor. The new Deukmejian signed bond measures in his second term that 
amount to $950 million for affordable housing programs. The funds provide 
relief for homeless people, low-income renters and first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The old Deukmejian rarely whispered a peep about the problems of high housing 
costs. In the last six months, the new Deukmejian has "jawboned about the issue 
more than any governor in recent memory," lobbyist David Booher said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's transformation on housing is mysterious and subject to various 
interpretations. (Deukmejian did not respond to requests to be interviewed for 
this column.) 
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that Deukmejian's new-found interest in housing was inspired by 
pressure from Republican legislators who were concerned that Democrats would 
make the problem of high housing costs an issue in this year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say politics had nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the federal government's retreat from expensive national 
housing subsidy programs, state officials all over the country struggled to 
figure out their role on housing. The argument goes that Deukmejian's shift in 
policy is a function of that learning curve. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any state that jumped into that void as aggressively as 
California," said Maureen Higgins, Deukmejian's housing chief. "And it happened 
under Deukmejian's watch." 
</P>
<P>
One explanation for the governor's metamorphosis is that the housing issue has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor and his key staff people began to understand the linkages between 
jobs, housing and the state's economic development," said Newport Beach 
planning consultant Susan DeSantis. 
</P>
<P>
"They recognize that without affordable housing, the economy suffers," said 
DeSantis who served as Deukmejian's first housing administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The implication is that Deukmejian was uncomfortable with the issue when the 
housing problem was cast solely as a social welfare matter. 
</P>
<P>
This may explain why low-income housing advocates have never warmed up to 
Deukmejian. They say that he begrudgingly signed housing bond measures and that 
his $2-billion home-buyer program serves yuppies who don't need relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Low-income housing advocates had so effectively characterized Deukmejian as 
being anti-housing that he was never able to recover from that image, which was 
undeserved in my opinion," said housing consultant Ward Connerly. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation for why Deukmejian signed the low-cost housing measure is that 
a broad coalition of church groups, real estate interests and business leaders 
got behind the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of low-cost housing had gone beyond the question of poor people's 
rights. It had become a mainstream issue -- a political plateau that most 
politicians, including Deukmejian, are more comfortable with.

IS THERE A THIRD WORLD WITHIN U.S.? TOO MANY CHILDREN COULD SAY YES; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: THE U.N. CONCLAVE FOCUSES ON THE YOUNG -- AND ALSO ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S 
FAILURE TO MAKE A REAL COMMITMENT. HE'S WASTING PRECIOUS TIME.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cause of children is progressing in much of the world. We saw dramatic 
proof of that progress last weekend when 71 heads of state met at the United 
Nations for an unprecedented world summit for children -- the largest gathering 
of national leaders in history. But we also had a dramatic disappointment: 
President Bush's performance. 
</P>
<P>
The President made a lackluster speech that used less than his allotted five 
minutes. He then left for Washington while the other world leaders stayed on. 
Back in Washington, he joined in announcing a budget agreement shortchanging 
American children's health, education and other needs and showing little regard 
for the nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
The summit, as a whole, produced some real hope for the world's children, hope 
that is desperately needed when millions are being killed by malnutrition, 
preventable diseases, war and abuse. Fifteen million children under the age of 
5 die every year around the world -- 40,000 a day. The summit participants 
agreed on a specific plan to try to save as many as 50 million children this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Goals include reducing child mortality in each nation by at least one-third, 
reducing malnutrition by one-half, raising immunization rates and assuring the 
earliest possible ratification by all governments of the international 
convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. children are in desperate need of real presidential and congressional 
leadership to reach these goals. With nearly 13 million poor children, we have 
a Third World within our nation One of every four U.S. infants and toddlers 
lives in poverty. And American children are two or three times more likely to 
live in poverty than those in countries we consider our peers and competitors 
-- countries like West Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland 
and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is an underdeveloped nation in caring for its children. It 
has 13 million children with no health insurance. It ranks 19th among nations 
in preventing infant mortality and 29th in preventing low-birth-weight births. 
Immunization rates are declining, and measles cases have increased tenfold in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, conditions for California's children are even worse. In 
recent years, California's child poverty, prenatal care, teen birth and school 
dropout rates have been worse than the United States' already terrible 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's brief appearance at the United Nations barely acknowledged any of these 
problems. Much of it was devoted to empty rhetorical flourishes. The President 
did allude to the education and health goals that he, the governors and the 
Public Health Service have set for the year 2000. But he failed, however, to 
suggest that he would take any specific measures to reach these goals. And he 
failed to mention that the United States is moving away from many of them. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Public Health Service goal is to reduce by more than one-third the 
rate of babies born too small to thrive. With some effort, this goal would be 
attainable, but the nation has not been making such an effort. From 1980 to 
1988, the rate of low-birth-weight births actually increased, rather than 
decline as in prior decades. We are also moving away from the Public Health 
Service goal that 90% of pregnant women get prenatal care during the first 
three months of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Early prenatal care and higher birth weights are the most effective way to 
reduce infant mortality. Judging from recent rates of progress, however, the 
United States will not come close to either its own or the U.N. summit's 
mortality goal by the end of the century. The nation's rate of infant deaths is 
still going down, but the rate of progress has become grindingly slow -- in the 
last three years, the infant death rate, on average, fell only one-third as 
fast as it did each year in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Bush knows these trends and how to reverse them, making his silence at the 
United Nations all the more inappropriate. Last November, a White House task 
force on infant mortality produced a draft report reviewing all this 
information and recommending initiatives that would save at least 10,000 U.S. 
babies' lives and prevent disabling conditions for another 100,000 each year. 
The President has done nothing to move the task-force recommendations forward. 
</P>
<P>
Bush should have talked at the summit about practical steps by which the United 
States can reach the year 2000 goals. He should have said that he would make 
room in the budget for the modest initiatives that are necessary. He should 
have told the American people that we have to start now -- not in 1996 or 1999 
-- if we want to attain these goals and not only help America's children but 
prepare our work force and strengthen our society. The nation needs the whole 
decade, not just two or four years, to reduce infant mortality by one-third. 
Bush is already wasting precious time. 
</P>
<P>
The President underlined his disinterest in the plight of America's children 
when he also failed to sign, endorse, or even mention the U.N. Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. This convention protects children against 
discrimination, parental abuse, drug trafficking, sexual exploitation, lack of 
health care, illiteracy and poverty. Around the world, 129 countries have 
either signed or ratified it. The major holdouts are Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
Cambodia, South Africa and the United States -- poor company, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The excuses given by White House staff for the President not signing the 
convention are just that -- excuses. One was that Bush believes the convention 
does not adequately protect fetuses. The convention is neutral on the abortion 
issue because the drafters knew that siding one way or the other would doom it 
in dozens of countries. 
</P>
<P>
This neutrality is fine with the many Catholic countries of Latin America, 
which have ratified the convention. It is fine with the Vatican, which has 
ratified it. But the White House says it is not good enough for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the excuses hide the reality that the President is simply too 
disinterested in children to do battle with the handful of senators who dislike 
any human-rights treaties. And such provisions as the clause requiring the 
nation to take reasonable steps to reduce infant mortality are the ones that 
really give the President pause. After all, he has already decided against such 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference after the 1988 election, Bush said, "When I talk 
about investing in our kids, that would be an indication of how I will pursue 
this objective of a 'kinder and gentler' nation." Ever since 1988, however, 
Bush has turned his back on America's children. The United States is becoming a 
meaner and harsher nation for children. 
</P>
<P>
While the U.N. summit was a watershed for tens of millions of children abroad, 
for U.S. children the event has had far less meaning. It is time for the 
President to start redeeming his pledges and to take the lead in attacking the 
child poverty, hunger, education, health and child-care problems that plague so 
many millions of our children and threaten our nation's future.

THE BUDGET DEBACLE; 
</P>
<P>
TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR AN AMERICA LACKING AN ECONOMIC PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert B. Reich, Robert B. Reich teaches political economy and management at

<P>
Was the budget compromise worth saving? George Bush's bully pulpit didn't work 
when he tried to convince the nation in a televised address Tuesday night that 
it was all for the best. No one ever supposed that Bush had the charisma of 
Ronald Reagan, or his predecessor's capacity for using oratory to sway public 
opinion. But perhaps there were other reasons why Congress found it so easy to 
resist Bush's pleas and his arm-twisting. The plan gave too much to the rich 
and the military, without solving the underlying problems of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
If the alternative to this flawed agreement is no deficit-reduction agreement 
at all, isn't it worth doing? According to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the 
Federal Reserve Board, the plan would have brought down interest rates and 
promoted economic growth. So we all benefit in the end -- even if today's 
sacrifices may not be as equitable as they might be. Administration economists 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with this logic is that it's built on quicksand. The economic 
projections underlying the plan assumed that oil prices would fall, that 
America would stay out of a recession, that the costs of the savings-and-loan 
bailout won't escalate and that the world won't be experiencing a credit 
crunch. All these assumptions are dubious, to say the least. They run counter 
to every observable trend. 
</P>
<P>
If oil prices continue their upward climb, and if Japan and Germany continue to 
use up their spare cash, interest rates will stay high and go higher, 
regardless of the budget accord. We're in a world economy now, if you hadn't 
noticed. U.S. interest rates don't depend solely on how much money is left over 
after the U.S. government and U.S. consumers and corporations stop spending. 
U.S. interest rates depend on how much is left over after governments, 
consumers and companies all over the world stop spending. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting America's budget deficit by $34 billion -- what the compromise sought 
for next year -- is like taking a bucket of sea water out of the Pacific. It 
doesn't have much effect on the tide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is likely to continue its downward slide -- so even 
the $34 billion cut is optimistic. Welfare and unemployment insurance costs are 
likely to rise precipitously. The federal government will have to bail out some 
big banks and insurance companies, as well as more S&amp;Ls. And tax receipts 
will shrink. My best guess is that the deficit-cutting agreement would have 
ended up reducing next year's budget deficit by $24 billion -- hardly a figure 
to write home about. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that cutting government spending and raising taxes right now, by 
even this relatively small amount, is the wrong tonic for a weakening economy. 
Consumers and corporations are already holding back, as high oil prices and 
their own massive borrowings scare them away from the market. It's the lesson 
that John Maynard Keynes should have taught us a half-century ago: Unless 
government picks up the slack, we could face an even deeper and longer 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the budget deficit? Isn't it a big problem? Yes, but we should 
have got serious about reducing it three years ago -- when the economy was 
riding high. Maybe we can safely raise taxes and cut spending a few years from 
now, when world interest rates and oil prices have come back down to earth and 
the U.S. economy is more buoyant. But not now. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, cutting the budget deficit is so important over the long term that it 
might even be worth rewarding the wealthy and the denizens of the Pentagon with 
huge windfalls, if that's the price of getting an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not worth that price right now, when all we get in return is a 
sluggish economy and a pail of seawater. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing that could be said for the defeated budget accord was that 
almost every major Washington lobby hated it. Farmers, truckers, liquor 
manufacturers, cigarette manufacturers, the makers of yachts and advocates for 
the elderly are still hollering. Conservative Republicans are angry that the 
compromise didn't include a capital-gains tax cut, and that Bush has so 
obviously reneged on his "no new taxes" pledge. Liberal Democrats are upset 
about proposed cuts in domestic programs like Medicare and farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
If everyone's angry, it must have been fair. 
</P>
<P>
But not quite everyone is angry, and it's here that we have cause for concern. 
The folks most content with the terms of the long-awaited budget compromise 
were two groups who expected to take a big hit -- who should have taken a big 
hit -- and didn't. 
</P>
<P>
First, the very wealthy. Yes, they'd have to pay a tiny surcharge on their 
yachts and jewelry, and wouldn't have quite as many deductions as before. But 
even if these inconveniences were included, their effective tax rate would have 
jumped only a tad -- from 28% to 29%. Champagne was flowing: The so-called 
bubble -- that allows higher-income earners to pay a lower marginal rate than 
the 33% paid by those below them -- continues to bubble away. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the plan created a loophole wide enough to drive a 10-ton tax 
shelter through: It allowed investors to deduct from their incomes a quarter of 
the price of any stock they buy in small and medium-sized businesses. Big 
businesses could be expected to transform themselves into collections of small 
businesses to take advantage of this provision. Wealthy investors -- and their 
tax lawyers -- would reap a bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
Wealthy retirees were especially pleased. Their Social Security remained 
untouched. There would be no increase in the proportion of Social Security 
benefits subjected to income tax, and no lifting of the ceiling on earned 
income subject to Social Security tax. As a result, the scandal continues: 
Upper-income retirees will go on taking from Social Security at least 3 times 
what they originally put into the system, counting inflation. And today's poor 
working Americans -- most of whom pay more in Social Security payroll taxes 
than in income taxes, because the system is so regressive -- continue to pick 
up most of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Tax progressivity, in other words, is still a nostalgic dream. Americans within 
the top 10% of incomes would have continued to pay about $90 billion a year 
less than if the tax code were as progressive as in 1977. The top 1% would bear 
the lightest relative burden -- continuing a trend that started years ago. In 
1989, the top 1% paid a combined federal-state-local tax rate of only 26.8%, 
compared with 29% in 1975 and 39.6% in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Lower-income taxpayers, on the other hand, would have taken a drubbing. Taxes 
on beer, cigarettes and alcohol would comprise a much higher portion of their 
income than the wealthy, of course. And if they weren't poor enough to qualify 
for Medicaid, their Medicare bills would go up. Here again, is a continuation 
of the trend that began years ago. In 1980, the bottom fifth of taxpayers paid 
an average 8.4% of their income in federal taxes. Last year, they paid 9.7% -- 
an increase of one-sixth. Under the proposed compromise, they'd have paid about 
10.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The other people who breathed a big sigh of relief were Pentagon officials and 
defense contractors. On paper, it looked like they'd take a $182.4 billion cut 
over the next 5 years. But look again: This was a reduction in projected 
increases. The generals were elated because they got a much better deal than 
they would have gotten even from their own appropriations committee. The House 
had already approved a level of defense spending for next year lower than that 
included in the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, defense spending would have stayed flat, without any real cuts. And 
their allotment didn't include all the extra money spent in the Persian Gulf -- 
that will come to at least $7.5 billion this year -- even if U.S. allies kick 
in all the money they've promised -- and far more if there's a war out there in 
the desert. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the federal government planned to spend exactly as much five 
years from now defending the world from communism as it does now -- even though 
it's hard to find any red-blooded communists these days, even though many 
Western Europeans would like U.S troops to leave and even though Europe and 
Japan are now capable of paying for their own defense. 
</P>
<P>
The budget compromise obliterated the Peace Dividend. Make no bones: This was a 
big victory for the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it: The big winners were the very wealthy and members of the 
military-industrial complex; the losers, most of the rest of us. Not a 
particularly compelling argument for why the package should have been enacted. 
</P>
<P>
If the polls are to be believed, the public has great confidence in Bush's 
handling of foreign affairs, but far less confidence in his management of the 
economy. Bush spent almost two years of his presidency trying to cut 
capital-gains taxes. This single issue became the centerpiece of his economic 
policy. Other important issues -- the budget deficit, along with Latin American 
debt and U.S. trade competitiveness -- got less attention. Meanwhile, the U.S. 
economy sputtered, the military continued to pile up huge bills, the rich got 
even richer and the poor even poorer and opposition mounted toward 
capital-gains breaks for the fat cats at the top. There was never much evidence 
that capital-gains tax cuts would spur economic growth anyway. In the end, Bush 
had to give up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Bush staked it all on his deficit-reduction plan. Of course, the huge federal 
deficit is itself evidence of the blatant failure of the Reagan-Bush 
Administration's experiment with supply-side economics, starting with the tax 
cut of 1981 and the subsequent military buildup. But the plan contained many of 
the same ideological blind spots. Here again, the biggest beneficiaries were 
the very rich. Here again, the military was given far more money than it can 
use. And here again, was scant evidence the plan would have helped the economy, 
especially in its current condition. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two years from now, Americans will decide whether to reelect Bush. 
When Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gov. 
Bill Clinton of Arkansas or Jesse Jackson asks them whether they're better off 
now than they were four years ago, it's likely that they'll answer with a 
resounding "no."

AX GRAMM-RUDMAN-HOLLINGS?; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICAL FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act aims to curb the federal deficit by forcing 
congressional and White House negotiators to come up with a budget plan or face 
deep cuts in government programs. No matter what happens to the latest plan, 
was Gramm-Rudman a positive or negative force in bringing it about? Should it 
be retained? The Times asked seven economic analysts: 
</P>
<P>
William E. Simon, secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon and Ford 
administrations: 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman process is a workable instrument to impose a degree of fiscal 
discipline on the Congress. The Congress tried its best to evade the law's 
(deficit-reduction) targets by raising the spending limits each year when it 
became apparent that the required belt-tightening would be too painful. Despite 
congressional manipulation, the process did serve as a restraint on spending. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that our deficit problem lies in the Congress itself, not in the 
Gramm-Rudman process or in various gimmicks designed to restrain the Congress' 
insatiable appetite to spend taxpayers' dollars. Members of Congress are driven 
by one overwhelming objective: their own re-election. Everything else -- 
including the integrity of our currency or the long-term health of our economy 
-- takes a back seat. 
</P>
<P>
Congressmen discovered long ago that they get re-elected by redistributing 
taxpayer funds to interest groups that will support their next campaign. Since 
virtually all 535 members of Congress behave this way, the result is absolute 
fiscal chaos in Washington, and we have to go to the brink of financial ruin 
before Congress will act. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I have long believed that one solution lies in fixing clear limitations on 
congressional terms of office. This would force our representatives to consult 
the long-term interests of our nation and put an end to the idea that a 
politician can use the federal budget to ensure his re-election term after term 
after term. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Gramm-Rudman process should be retained as a measure to restrain 
spending, but it must be undergirded by other disciplining measures such as 
congressional term limitations and a presidential line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Anderson, senior fellow, Hoover Institution at Stanford University: 
</P>
<P>
There is only one way out of this deadly economic trap that our budget generals 
have fought their way into. We need to adopt the "Lithuanian Solution" -- just 
suspend Gramm-Rudman-Hollings for a year. Instead of raising taxes and plunging 
this economy into a recession that will create a deficit that really is 
dangerous, we should live with our relatively small deficit a while longer, 
defeat Saddam Hussein and resolve the gulf crisis, control spending as much as 
we can, enjoy Christmas and see how things look in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Kuttner, author of the forthcoming book, "The End of Laissez-Faire": 
</P>
<P>
There was a point in time, circa 1985, when it made sense to enact something 
like Gramm-Rudman as a way to hold Reagan's feet to the fire, to force him to 
choose between his military buildup and his tax policy. But Gramm-Rudman has 
become a chronic way of paralyzing government. It's been overtaken by events. 
</P>
<P>
The whole budget is now so totally out of whack and the numbers are so big -- 
and they keep changing Gramm-Rudman, anyway -- that it's become, on balance, 
more of a negative. I think they should scrap it. 
</P>
<P>
The only way the budget is ever going to get back into balance is by restoring 
the tax rates on rich people to what they were pre-1981. Gramm-Rudman, coupled 
with the Administration's refusal to entertain taxes on the rich, turns it into 
a chronic game of pass the buck. I think it would be ridiculous to extend it, 
and tinker with it, one more time. It's like a mirage in the desert. It's 
always 20 miles away from you. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Eickhoff, former chief economist, Office of Management and Budget 
during the Reagan Administration: 
</P>
<P>
Gramm-Rudman has performed a useful function in the four years since its 
enactment in 1986. Eleven billion dollars in true savings resulted from the 
first sequester. The brief sequester forced by (OMB Director Richard) Darman 
early in fiscal 1990 also produced savings. It is doubtful that savings in 
other years were greater than what would have been achieved in Gramm-Rudman's 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
By shifting budget ground rules, Gramm-Rudman has produced new opportunities 
for "smoke and mirrors." It has also provided a needed discipline to the budget 
process. However, in and of itself, it has not been able to solve the budget 
crisis nor prevent it from getting much worse. 
</P>
<P>
If Gramm-Rudman is to continue, the targets must once again be amended. The 
budget compromise proposal is a step in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no Gramm-Rudman, it would have to be invented to give the budget 
committees the clout they need to enforce the budget resolution. It is better 
to improve the Gramm-Rudman that we know than try to get along without it. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Thurow, dean of the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology: 
</P>
<P>
Under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings as passed, we're already supposed to have balanced 
the budget. And, in fact, the budget deficit in 1992, even with a budget 
package, is going to be bigger than it was in 1991. It's like canoeing very 
rapidly up a river that's running very fast so that you're actually going 
backward, even though you're paddling like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
I think the event that makes the (budget negotiators) more serious this time is 
that the Germans and Japanese have basically been funding the deficit, and the 
Germans have notified the world that they're not going to be lending money to 
the rest of the world. They're going to be borrowing money and putting their 
money, plus the borrowed money, into East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the events in the Tokyo stock market, as well as the interest in 
building more housing in Japan, it seems highly likely that the Japanese are 
also going to be lending less money to the world in the future. That basically 
makes it impossible to evade (the deficit) in the way in which we've evaded it 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it's Gramm-Rudman that's essentially put our feet to the fire. 
Effectively, we've already scrapped Gramm-Rudman. It's a perfect example of why 
a constitutional amendment to balance the budget doesn't work, because the 
people running the country who make laws cannot make laws. All they did was 
keep the budget imbalance from getting as bad as it would have been without 
Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Barfield, resident fellow, American Enterprise Institute: 
</P>
<P>
I think that Gramm-Rudman, on balance, has been a very positive force over the 
last few years and was a force in getting the Administration and the Congress 
to get together. The people who often criticize Gramm-Rudman say that it 
represents a bankruptcy of the political process, that it's throwing 
decision-making to some kind of institutional gimmick. The problem with that is 
it gets it backward. The political process was bankrupt in the first place, and 
therefore turned to something like Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
It's like a killer who writes on a mirror, "Stop me before I kill again." And 
that's what Congress did, in effect, when it passed Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
. . . The Congress does need some form of discipline, because I see no signs 
that it will discipline itself. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Laffer, former economic consultant for President Reagan: 
</P>
<P>
Real or perceived deadlines only encourage bad decisions. Gramm-Rudman has, for 
several years now, introduced an artificial deadline with a national threat -- 
the sequester of enormous sums of government spending. The stock-market crash 
of 1987 was a direct consequence of Gramm-Rudman. The deleterious implications, 
however, are nowhere more apparent than they are with the recent budget 
compromise. The Gramm-Rudman deadline forced polarization within the 
legislative and executive branches and tried to achieve its resolution by 
confrontation, not by reason. 
</P>
<P>
. . . The political dynamics are bad enough under normal times, but with 
Gramm-Rudman they are catastrophic. Gramm-Rudman should be legislated out of 
existence.

SOVIET UNION: BY PROMISING TO RESIGN IF HE COULDN'T FIX THE REELING ECONOMY (HE 
HASN'T), THE PRIME MINISTER MADE HISTORY. WAS IT JUST RHETORIC?

<TEXT>
<P>
Whether Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's government should resign has long ceased to be a 
subject of behind-the-scenes whispers or parliamentary debate. Coal miners and 
street demonstrators have recently demanded nothing less than his speedy 
retirement as prime minister. The Soviet Parliament, as well, has voted no 
confidence in Ryzhkov's performance. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, does his government manage to cling to power despite these tough, 
and occasionally uncompromising, demands? 
</P>
<P>
There is no precedent for a government in the Soviet Union to give up its 
power. Individual bureaucrats or ministers can -- and do -- lose their jobs, 
usually by premature retirement. But resignation of an entire government -- not 
in a totalitarian state. 
</P>
<P>
Yet precisely this possibility was raised last year when the new Supreme Soviet 
was formed. In presenting his plan to restore the Soviet economy to an even 
keel, Leonid I. Abalkin, vice premier for economic policy, said his government 
needed 15 months to do the job. Abalkin promised that he, along with the rest 
of the Ryzhkov government, would step down if the economy was still reeling 
when his time was up. 
</P>
<P>
With fewer than three months to go, the lines for food and other necessities -- 
if available -- are longer than ever. But it is clear that Ryzhkov and his 
government have no intention of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
For starters, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has used his newly acquired 
extraordinary powers to shield his prime minister from the mounting resignation 
calls. But even before the Soviet president rescued him, Ryzhkov had no plans 
to fulfill his aide's vow to resign, despite his government's economic 
bungling. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: His monopoly of power, cracked but not broken, eliminates 
his responsibility for policies and decisions. The higher a leader rises in the 
political hierarchy, the more solid his claim to infallibility. The absence of 
a strong opposition undercuts politically motivated criticism; all other 
criticisms fail to reach either their target or the public. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov -- and probably his Cabinet -- do not see themselves as responsible for 
the piteous state of the country. This helps to explain why the demeanor of so 
politically unpopular a leader can appear so unruffled. Far more important, 
however, is Ryzhkov's conviction that he is saving the country from chaos and 
economic catastrophe. This near-messianic self-perception appears to be his 
main weapon in battling hostile public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
It is also entirely possible that Ryzhkov regularly tells Gorbachev what he's 
telling himself -- the government is still in control. The government is the 
only body capable of managing the huge and cumbersome machinery. Should it 
resign, trains would stop, cities would starve, people would freeze. At least 
this is what Ryzhkov tells us. 
</P>
<P>
His confidence is not groundless. The military-industrial complex and other 
Soviet industrial giants -- transportation and energy production -- run 
according to traditional methods of management. The ways of the market are 
totally alien to them. Indeed, during the debate on the transition to a 
free-market system, managers of the big military plants appealed to the 
reformers and public not to touch the defense Establishment. These managers 
represent a formidable force, possibly stronger than that of the professional 
military. Clearly, this situation impressed Gorbachev, who quashed all 
"attempts at overhauling the managing structures in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Another probable consideration in keeping Ryzhkov in power is Gorbachev's fear 
that the removal of the prime minister would disrupt the overall political 
balance and lead to a direct confrontation with Boris N. Yeltsin, the president 
of the Russian republic. True, the radical and totally unpredictable Russian 
leader has signed a peace treaty with Gorbachev, to everyone's satisfaction. 
But differences between the two linger. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev may also have concluded that letting Ryzhkov, a personification of 
old and new failures, go would remove one of his few remaining political 
buffers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Soviet president may simply see no acceptable alternatives to 
Ryzhkov. Indeed, the system is not designed to create any, since business or 
management, in the true sense of the terms, doesn't exist in the Soviet Union. 
The absence of bright new economic managers sharply contrasts with the 
emergence of many new political faces, among them Gavriil K. Popov, Anatoly A. 
Sobchak or Sergei B. Stankevich. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov is both a symbol of the party's handling of the economy and its victim. 
It was the Politburo -- not he -- that, in 1985, conceived the idea of 
simultaneous acceleration of economic growth and reform of the economy. Two 
years were spent in convulsive and fruitless activities,with the negative 
trends only intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Ryzhkov work out the main directions of the reform blueprint, adopted 
by the Central Committee's plenary session in June, 1987. His main task was to 
execute the plan and he did just that, firmly and energetically. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Ryzhkov, one of the best prime ministers in the history of the 
Soviet state, is one of a decent man who works for the common good. But he is 
unable to modify, let alone shed, views and convictions formed over a lifetime. 
That has cost him a chance of winning new credit.

DEBT: WITH ITS AAA CREDIT RATING, CALIFORNIA IS LIKE A ONCE-SUCCESSFUL 
BUSINESSMAN WHOSE INCOME IS PLUMMETING BUT WHOSE CREDIT LINE IS INTACT.

<TEXT>
<P>
California is going into debt at an alarming rate. Voters approved $5 billion 
in state bonds in June and are being asked to sign off on an another $5.3 
billion next month. Such a result would more than double the amount of bond 
debt that California had at the end of 1989, and would represent a borrowing 
rate 10 times that of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
This borrowing binge amounts to nothing less than a mortgaging of California's 
future. Bond issues are not free money -- they must be repaid like any other 
loan, with interest. Repayment of these obligations, once the bonds have been 
sold, will cost the state at least $4 billion a year for a generation to come. 
The numbers will become even more mind-boggling as additional debt is created 
in future years. 
</P>
<P>
With its blue-chip, AAA credit rating, California is like a once-successful 
businessman whose income is plummeting but whose credit line is intact. As 
State Treasurer Tom Hayes has repeatedly pointed out, the market for California 
bonds is becoming saturated and, as it becomes apparent that our financial 
health is fading, our bond rating will drop and our borrowing costs will 
increase, thereby compounding an already vicious cycle. Even now, the state has 
a backlog of more than $10 billion in unsold bonds; Hayes urges that future 
sales be held to no more than $2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, the day of reckoning is already here. We are rapidly 
approaching the point where the state will be paying, largely from the general 
fund, as much as $5,000 a year for every California resident just to amortize 
bond proceeds that have already been spent. This drain on the general fund has 
become a prime ingredient in the yearly torturous budget process, as the 
Legislature and the governor strain to find any remaining discretionary funds 
for vital programs. 
</P>
<P>
Why this massive and accelerating reliance on bond debt to finance government 
operations in California? 
</P>
<P>
The simple answer is that revenues are falling billions of dollars short of 
meeting the state's costs of even routine governmental activities, let alone 
public works and other special programs. The bond issues on the November 
ballot, for example, would finance, among other things, drug enforcement, 
forest conservation, veterans' home loans and construction of schools, prisons, 
child-care centers and university facilities. 
</P>
<P>
As the pathetic spectacle of this year's state budget battle demonstrated, 
Sacramento is too factionalized to set spending priorities by anything 
approaching consensus, particularly as spending demands outstrip budget growth. 
Under the circumstances, borrowing, especially with the voters' approval, is an 
easy way out for a divided Legislature and a governor unalterably opposed to 
new general taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomenon is occurring at the local level, where officials are 
finding themselves increasingly short of general funds to finance programs and 
facilities demanded by the citizenry, especially in rapidly developing 
communities with inadequate infrastructure. Lacking enough conventional revenue 
sources, local jurisdictions are utilizing assessment districts, special tax 
districts and other money-raising entities to finance and carry out even the 
most customary of governmental activities -- building roads and schools, 
providing police and fire services. In the process, they are collectively 
generating a debt of approximately $5 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Debt financing -- whether in the form of general obligation bonds backed by the 
full faith and credit of the issuing jurisdiction or revenue bonds supported by 
identified revenue sources -- has become the stop-gap solution to California's 
fiscal crisis. To understand this situation, it is necessary to look back to 
the tax revolt of the late 1970s and the adoption of the Jarvis and Gann 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13, a constitutional amendment adopted in 1978, undercut the 
primary revenue source of local government by sharply reducing real-estate 
assessments and restricting increases in subsequent years. It also established 
a two-thirds vote requirement for new special taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, voters, by passing Proposition 4, imposed constitutional 
limits on government spending at all levels, allowing only modest adjustments 
in future years. They further reduced, in 1988, what little discretion remained 
in allocating state expenditures by adopting Proposition 98, requiring roughly 
40% of state general funds to go to public education. Meanwhile, federal 
assistance to local governments during the Reagan years was gutted and state 
revenues declined as a result of income-tax indexing, begun in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the tax revolt on state government were not felt directly for 
some time. With revenue sources other than property taxes untouched, Sacramento 
continued to prosper along with the state economy, although the new 
restrictions on local revenues rapidly brought on demands for redistributing a 
portion of state funds to local jurisdictions. By the mid-'80s, however, both 
state and local governments had begun to feel the concussive effects of the 
Gann time bomb, as the permitted increases in spending were overtaken by 
economic growth and demands for public expenditures. By the turn of the '90s, 
virtually every governmental unit in the state had reached its spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials seized upon the perfect solution to this budgetary 
dilemma: a funding source that not only generates added funds but also is 
exempt from the Gann limits. Proposition 4 had specifically exempted any 
subsequent voter-approved bonded debt, thus allowing public officials to 
present to the electorate bond issues intended to finance every variety of 
governmental activity. For voters who had begun to feel the pinch of the 
shortfalls in government revenues and spending, even in the middle-class 
suburbs where the tax revolt was spawned, this was blessed relief. 
</P>
<P>
Stop-gap measures, however, can only do so much. It is finally becoming common 
wisdom, among both the state's political leadership and the electorate, that 
California's public financing system should be substantially restructured. 
Toward that end, some initial steps have already been taken: Last June, voters 
loosened the Gann spending limits and adopted an increase in gasoline taxes. 
Actually, the tax revolt had barely subsided when voters began passing 
virtually every measure authorizing increased local spending, usually for 
targeted programs. Furthermore, polls increasingly point to voter approval of 
increasing general taxation and expenditure, especially to support the 
traditional governmental obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts argue that the kind of spending enabled by bond financing is 
simply an investment in the economic future of the state, and thus should not 
be discouraged. Certainly, new roads or universities paid for by bonds 
indirectly stimulate economic growth, but the link gets more tenuous when it 
comes to new government office buildings and drug enforcement. In any case, 
this argument begs the fundamental question of whether there isn't a better 
approach to finance government activities generally. 
</P>
<P>
A number of basic changes need to be made to stabilize the financing of state 
and local government in California and restore a sense of order to what has 
become an overly ad hoc process. This requires not only reducing reliance upon 
bond financing, but also making it more flexible and simultaneously developing 
alternative revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional provisions established by Proposition 13 must be revamped. 
No one suggests repealing it. But its current assessment procedures are biased 
in favor of longer-term owners, particularly commercial properties. Some form 
of split-tax roll would not only reduce this inequity, but would generate 
substantial additional property-tax revenues for local government. At the same 
time, it is critical that voters reject Proposition 136, which would require a 
two-thirds vote on new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Local general obligation bonds should be made subject to approval by simple 
majority rather than a two-thirds margin, thereby providing easier access to 
financing backed with tax revenues generated by the entire community. This 
would be a more equitable alternative to the special taxes and assessments now 
in such wide use. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the state should be required to redistribute any surplus above its annual 
spending limit to local governments; local governments themselves should seek 
more revenues from user fees, that, like bond debt, are exempted from the Gann 
spending limits, as well as from Proposition 98's provisions. At the same time, 
it is necessary that the radical allocation of state funds imposed by this 
proposition be substantially modified to allow more flexible setting of 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
After the November election, it is crucial that the new governor make a 
priority of coming to terms with the Legislature on a program for restoring a 
stable and responsible base to public finance in California. The voters, on our 
behalf and that of the future generations who are already becoming heir to the 
debts we are creating this year, must demand no less.

MORALE OF MARINES IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times takes exception to the order of the Marine Corps commandant. It goes 
on to say that he should be taking steps to increase morale by providing 
various recreational facilities and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The Times obviously knows nothing of the history of the Marine Corps or of the 
way Marines talk to each other. When surrounded by more than 100,000 Chinese 
during the Korean war, the commander of the 1st Marine Division said, "Now we 
have them just where we want them; we can attack in any direction." Another 
Marine colonel during a desperate Pacific battle urged a reluctant Marine 
forward by saying "Get out of that foxhole. Do you want to live forever!" 
</P>
<P>
In addressing his Marines in Saudi Arabia, probably on the eve of a great 
battle, Gray was acutely aware of the hardships they are going through and 
probably raised morale a little by "ordering" that there be morale. 
</P>
<P>
Lighten up, Times; that's the way Marines are.

IMMIGRATION QUOTAS GO UP -- BUT NOT SUPPORTING SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who can argue with the generous changes Congress wants to make in U.S. 
immigration laws? Groups as diverse as conservative economists and liberal 
minority activists are pushing for them. We favor them, too -- but we can't 
help but wonder what Congress will do when the bills come in. 
</P>
<P>
THE BILL: The Senate approved its version of the Family Unity and Employment 
Opportunity Act of 1990 months ago and the House did last week, but a 
conference committee must resolve the differences. With the federal budget and 
Persian Gulf crisis to keep it busy, Congress may not get around to immigration 
before it adjourns. But it just might, because the members aren't as divided on 
immigration this year as they were on the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
That's mainly because the current measure isn't restrictionist. To 
oversimplify, IRCA was the "bad cop" law designed to stop illegal immigration. 
The 1990 bill is a "good cop" law designed to promote the "right" kinds of 
immigration -- allowing relatives in to bring families together and to lure 
skilled workers in to help the economy. The bill also seeks to promote 
immigration that's legal -- thus less difficult to monitor and control. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 act began as an effort to make it easier for immigrants from Ireland 
to enter this country. By now, there's something in it for almost everyone: A 
special category of visas for Hong Kong residents pleases Asians, and 
family-reunification provisions to benefit newly legalized immigrants are 
favored by Latinos. And employers like the idea of being able to bring in 
immigrant workers if they can't find U.S. citizens to fill jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the very ease with which Congress is moving to enact this measure raises 
some alarms. 
</P>
<P>
THE SOCIAL COSTS: Granted, immigrants contribute much when they arrive here -- 
especially those with badly needed skills that help keep U.S. companies 
competitive or with the entrepreneurial drive to start up businesses that put 
people to work. But immigrants also have children who must be educated. Others 
have medical needs that must be met. A few become criminals -- only three of 
the social costs of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Those costs become very apparent because immigrants do not scatter all over the 
nation in a perfectly random pattern; they cluster in a few big cities and key 
states with the best job opportunities. This is one reason public schools in 
Los Angeles are badly overcrowded. It is one reason that public hospitals in 
Orange County are flooded with immigrant women who need prenatal care but can't 
afford private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrant clustering is not only unfair to immigrants, but it is also 
unfair to existing residents, who under these circumstances sometimes develop a 
resentment toward newcomers that can slip over the line into nativism and even 
racism. So if Congress does go on to enact the 1990 immigration act, as it 
should, we'd suggest its members keep in mind their lofty rhetoric about the 
benefits of immigration when it comes time to deal with the costs. Most 
Californians are glad, even proud, to be creating the New America. But we could 
use help paying for it. Let's not blindfold ourselves to reality. 
</P>
<P>

MORALE OF MARINES IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports that U.S. troop morale is fading, coupled with Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney's claim that Saddam Hussein may lash out against Western military 
forces, are ominous portents of war in the gulf. Consider the context: rising 
oil prices, Iraq's tenacity during the war with Iran, grudging acknowledgment 
of the hypocritical, self-serving nature of Western claims and actions against 
Hussein, and mounting concern over the expense of merely maintaining our 
forces, let alone engaging in war. 
</P>
<P>
These factors are combining to force President Bush to resolve the conflict 
within a few weeks, or face the prospect of growing domestic disillusionment 
and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The media tell us that the military buildup is approaching the level necessary 
to launch an offensive against Iraqi forces; a high-ranking defense chief is 
sacked, not for what he said, but because he said it, and historians with 
highly selective memories announce that a Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is an 
insufficient U.S. policy goal -- the proper one being the destruction of the 
Iraqi military. 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but believe that we are being conditioned for a U.S.-staged "Iraq 
Incident," an incident that will then be used to justify a massive U.S. 
response. 
</P>
<P>
The great tragedy is that so much is at stake. Human lives, cheap oil, Kuwaiti 
sovereignty -- these are important, but what seems to be overlooked is the 
effect this crisis' outcome will have on the nature of the future world order. 
It is imperative that American policy-makers as well as citizens, realize that 
the manner in which the present gulf crisis is resolved will decide what 
preparations Third World nations make for the next international dispute.

For as long as American servicemen live in a desolate and hostile environment 
without beer, booze, female companionship, television, girlie magazines and 
other things that relieve boredom, there will be a morale problem, Gen. Gray's

HYPING DOOM FOR THE SOVIET ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW'S WANNABE YUPPIES HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING THE SITUATION LOOK 
WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there's one craggy outcrop of fact in a sea of uncertainty, it's surely that 
the Soviet economy is in dreadful shape. Everybody says so, most of all the 
free-marketeers in Moscow who are massed behind that salesman of a 500-day dash 
to privatization, Stanislav S. Shatalin. 
</P>
<P>
But as we'll see, much of this doomsday scenario is self-interested propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Start with some basic data. The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of 
crude oil and in 1989 was the largest oil exporter, too, at 3.7 million barrels 
a day. Since it no longer must export at deflated prices to Eastern Europe, it 
stands to gain an extra $24 billion or more just from oil this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is the world's leading producer of steel, large-diameter pipe, 
chemicals, fertilizer, cement, synthetic rubber and aluminum. Between 1967 and 
1989 its industrial production doubled, and the U.S. government estimated that 
between 1985 and 1989 its gross national product increased at a rate of 2% per 
annum, the same as West Germany's. And although there are problems with the 
harvest, the fact remains that the 1990 Soviet grain crop is the largest in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago I met my old friend Lynn Turgeon, retired this year from 
his post as professor of economics, specializing in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe, at Hofstra University. Turgeon had just returned from a 
two-week trip to the Soviet Union, especially the Upper Volga. He's been going 
to the Soviet Union since 1966 -- 11 trips in all -- and so has a pretty good 
historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to all the dire reporting, supplies -- mainly food but also stuff in 
department stores -- are better than they were four years ago," he said. "I 
always collect farm market prices and have been doing so for many years. This 
time my hobby paid off. In the United States you'll see estimates of a 10% 
inflation rate in the Soviet Union, but in fact this increase is confined to 
Moscow and Leningrad, and outside those cities there was no increase in 
repressed inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Get out of the two major cities to some-place like Voronezh, and pork is five 
times cheaper, Turgeon says. And those stories of bread and riots and scarcity? 
He thinks they are much exaggerated, to drum up support for Shatalin's 500-day 
plan to convert to a so-called market economy: "There's a symbiosis of interest 
between what I term the 'socialist bourgeoisie' in Moscow and Western 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The socialist bourgeoisie are hellbent on getting convertible rubles so they 
can pick up their VCRs and porno cassettes when they travel. They are anxious 
for the Yuppie life and you can't have that without a convertible ruble. Most 
Russians don't travel and couldn't care less about convertibility." 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon emphasized one thing I'd noticed in Moscow a couple of years ago -- the 
tendency of the Muscovite intelligentsia to hysteria, leaping from one puddle 
of gossip, half-baked information and bogus theorizing to another. They aren't 
to be trusted to get anything straight. Yet the "reformers" who solemnly told 
the U.S. Congress that CIA growth estimates were wrong by a factor of four were 
treated with the utmost seriousness. The Soviet Friedmanites have an ax to 
grind -- the need for crash conversion -- and will say anything, however silly 
and incredible, to buttress their case. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Western journalists are eager for anything negative about the 
Soviet economy. So the Russian socialist bourgeoisie produce stories of 
disaster; the journalists enlarge their significance and then the Muscovite 
intelligentsia quote these Western stories back as evidence of the need for 
crisis action. 
</P>
<P>
Of course these journalists mostly stick to Moscow and Leningrad. They don't 
see the relative abundances of the country-side or the unwillingness of 
producers to ship to the two cities, whose officials largely blame political 
resentments and uncertainty about the ruble for such dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon argues that the existing economic program is doing better than is 
generally recognized, though the rate is slow and therefore infuriating to 
Russians waiting for magic changes. People who believe in magic will say 
anything, particularly if reporters are standing ready to write it all down. 
Shatalin admits to being a devotee of astrology, as is an increasing number of 
Muscovites. This is to be expected from naive worshipers of the "free market" 
with its "hidden hand," as is the likelihood that, if given their head, they 
can gravely injure a fundamentally powerful economy.

WHAT IF THE WORLD CALLED 'LEADER' AND NOBODY STOOD UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a Los Angeles Times syndicated columnist 
based in Paris.

<P>
FRANKFURT, Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A geopolitical order emerges very different from the one we have known since 
World War II, not only in its actors but in its character. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three dominant industrial powers today, two, Germany and Japan, make no 
effort to translate this power into any other form of influence than the 
financial and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The third power, the United States, is the only one of the three to think of 
itself in classic geopolitical terms and to assume a responsibility for what 
international society should become. It possesses great military power, which 
it cannot now really afford to employ, given the national choices it has made 
with respect to budget and taxes. It is in crucial respects dependent on its 
Japanese and European creditors, which have proved reluctant to finance the 
American deployment in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A period thus has begun where one country professes a global vision and global 
responsibilities, yet depends financially upon others who do not. 
</P>
<P>
The debate between Japan, Germany and the United States reflects contradictory 
assumptions. The United States says to them: You need an orderly world in order 
to prosper. You must either police the world yourselves or finance our policing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Their reply, as yet unspoken, but clear enough, says (to take the current 
example) that it makes little difference to them who owns the oil wells of the 
Arabian Peninsula, since whoever does will still need to sell as much oil as 
possible at as high a price as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Americans ask: But what about the principle of nonaggression? What about making 
the world a just and orderly place? The answer implicit in Germany's and 
Japan's actions is that, while they will cooperate in whatever the world 
community may collectively choose to do, disorder does not greatly concern them 
so long as it is confined to the Middle East or Africa or Southeast Asia. Or, 
to put it less harshly, that they do not consider themselves capable of 
imposing international order nor entitled to do so. Let Arabs, Africans, 
Israelis and Asians be responsible for their own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
There are many Americans for whom this logic is appealing. They ask if it is 
logical for the United States to conduct a global policy meant to keep order in 
the common interest when to do so engenders hostility toward the United States 
and produces little credit. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion logically drawn from what these Americans argue, and from the 
nature of Germany's and Japan's employment of power and their perception of 
international obligation, is that we may soon find ourselves with no nation 
really prepared to assume global responsibilities, or at least to do so 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
With Russia gone from the arena, will this produce a better, or worse, world 
than we have known since the 1940s? The conventional wisdom says worse. I am 
inclined to say better. Of course, that is not saying much.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months ago, Nelson Mandela, the deputy president of the African National 
Congress, and President Frederick W. de Klerk set South Africa on what all 
hoped would be a course of reconciliation and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the country's majority black community is now occupied with burying its 
dead, victims of an unbelievable eruption of violence during the past several 
weeks that has claimed more than 800 lives just in the black townships of the 
Transvaal. 
</P>
<P>
The primary violence has been between ANC supporters and members of Inkatha, 
the Zulu political organization led by Chief Gatsha Buthelezi. There has also 
been seemingly random killing. Seven people died when commuters were fired on 
at a station, and another 26 blacks were killed when two gangs of men attacked 
a train going from Johannesburg to Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting has been exploited by right-wingers in the white community and 
government security forces. Elements in the police, incensed by De Klerk's 
liberalization policies, are accused of stoking the violence and even arming 
factions as a way to "prove" that blacks are not ready to join in governing the 
nation. Circumstantial evidence points strongly at the participation of whites 
in some of the slaughter. It seems clear that some third force, whoever is 
behind it, is determined to turn the black townships into little Beiruts, and 
thus frustrate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing alters the fact that black political rivalries have been violently 
expressed since 1984, when supporters of the various factions intensified their 
efforts for territorial ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
The years of battle just between the ANC and Inkatha in Natal province are 
estimated to have killed 4,000 people. One-thousand more have died elsewhere, 
as ANC, PAC and Azapo supporters exterminated one another. The factions killed 
to defend themselves, killed to defend positions, or killed to conquer new 
territories of influence. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the Inkatha-ANC blood bath spread to townships in the Transvaal, 
near Johannesburg. It was expressed in an explosion of old antagonisms between 
township residents and the primarily Zulu miners who live in dormitory hostels. 
</P>
<P>
Township residents look down on hostel inmates, whom they consider to be 
country bumpkins. The miners resent their forced separation from wives in the 
homelands while township residents are allowed both their families and their 
livelihoods. Prostitution, much to the anger of township dwellers, is rife and 
local women are selling themselves to hostel inmates. 
</P>
<P>
To add to these discords, streetwise township youths have no respect for 
traditions and customs important to the miners. When these youths, often the 
most militant faction in townships, called strikes and boycotts during the past 
few years, the hostel dwellers resented being ordered about "by children." 
</P>
<P>
These old antagonisms have been reformulated in ANC-Inkatha terms, setting the 
stage for the worst black-on-black violence the townships have ever known. 
</P>
<P>
The hostility was compounded by recent talks between the ANC and government, 
which pointedly excluded Buthelezi. Additionally, ANC supporters have been 
abrasive when dealing with political opponents in the black community. Because 
the ANC enjoys dominance in the townships, it has not consulted other groups on 
negotiations, or when it calls boycotts and strikes. Buthelezi and Mandela have 
failed consistently to agree on conditions for a face-to-face meeting. 
</P>
<P>
With the leadership not talking, the foot soldiers have fought on, littering 
the townships and hostels with corpses to be hurled like logs onto government 
trucks and taken to mortuaries. The dreaded "necklace" killings, with victims 
often torched alive, have returned. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stem the violence, the government imposed a curfew in several 
townships. Heavily armed police were strategically placed and given powers to 
search and detain suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has justifiably protested the imposition of the regulations, since the 
government now effectively controls the townships and monitors political 
activity. But township residents do not look that far. All they desperately 
want is to live through the day. As far as these ordinary residents are 
concerned, black organizations must first stop their fighting before the police 
are moved out. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the challenge facing our political organizations. They can succeed 
only if the democracy they preach is applied, even before liberation. This 
means that freedom of association must be a way of life in the townships. ANC, 
Inkatha, PAC, Azapo -- all must compete in peace. If this is not done, the road 
to Parliament will be that much harder.

YORUBA FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Last week the Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance that makes 
animal sacrifice illegal, even in the practice of religion. Obadinah Songobumi 
of the Yoruba faith, which originated in West Africa and is known in the 
Americas by such names as Santeria and Macumba, is concerned about the new law. 
He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a bad law. If they are going to pass such a law, they should have it 
passed all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They shouldn't just restrict it to Los Angeles where you have a lot of the 
Yoruba people. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think it will affect the practice of the religion, because people are 
going to practice it anyway. They just will be wiser about the way they do it. 
(The religion) is already underground. It's been going on for thousands of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how they ever came to the conclusion that animals are tortured. 
And we would not leave dead animals around. It's just not done that way. That 
is a lot of media hype. 
</P>
<P>
What is the difference in what we do and the killing of wild horses (by 
government agencies) or cows (in slaughterhouses)? 
</P>
<P>
Of course there is an element of racism behind the law. If they could stop us 
from playing drums they would do that, too.

NEW SYSTEM LETS STUDENTS PHONE IN ANSWERS TO TESTS

Dial "D" for diploma. 
</P>
<P>
University students can now take exams from the comfort of their own homes 
using a telephone message system called Telequiz. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it, but I don't know why," said student Jean Pajak. "Maybe it's the 
spontaneity of it." 
</P>
<P>
In what is believed to be first student testing via touch-tone telephone, 
students at suburban Governors State University called in the answers to their 
Psychology 519 quiz on Sept. 29-30 
</P>
<P>
They answered by punching in numbers that were registered with computerized 
voice-mail equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Pajak and classmates took a 10-question multiple-choice quiz, punching the 
numbers 1 through 4 on their tough-tone phones to register their answers with a 
school computer. 
</P>
<P>
Students taking Management 421 will also try the program, taking an exam of 15 
true-or-false questions by pressing 1 for true or 2 for false. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a replacement for the old-fashioned No. 2 lead pencil," said Donald 
Fricker, a professor of management information systems who developed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Fricker said Telequiz saves time and money. 
</P>
<P>
"I can administer any quiz in just two or three days as opposed to where the 
secretary has to type it, I have to copy it, the class has to meet, and I still 
have to grade it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The system also eliminates the need to travel to the college in suburban 
University Park. The 5,000-student school has no dormitories, and many students 
have outside job and family responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The system lets instructors record up to 30 questions. It can handle just one 
student at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Quiz-takers have six or seven seconds to think of an answer before the next 
question is asked -- too short a time for a student to cheat by looking up the 
answer in a book, Fricker said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Telequiz will be demonstrated to representatives of 600 schools at 
the annual Computers on Campus conference in Myrtle Beach, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Barker took her psychology test sitting at the kitchen table after she 
had cleared the dinner dishes. 
</P>
<P>
"Being at home, it was different than being somewhere where there's a lot of 
pressure," said Barker, 52, a child-welfare worker pursuing an undergraduate 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
The system "gives a student tremendous flexibility," Fricker said. "The student 
can be at his most relaxed. He can call in at 4 a.m. if that's when he's 
achieved nirvana and feels he knows the material."

Night life is creeping back to once glamorous West Beirut, for years a hotbed

"Lebanese are aggressive and unpredictable people. You can't tie them to their

strength of better security in mainly Muslim West Beirut and a desire for fun 
among Lebanese -- regardless of the damage to their inflation-hit wallets. 
</P>
<P>
"Just last summer I used to go around the city without finding a single crowded 
restaurant among the eight or nine still open at the time," said Walid Sultani, 
owner of a new restaurant in the chic Verdun area of West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"Now with about 20 new restaurants opening in the area over the past three 
months, you can't find an empty seat on a Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
Incomes in Lebanon, where 15 years of civil war destroyed much of the economy, 
have been hit by soaring inflation, which bankers estimate at 150% in the last 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pound has taken a severe battering. Before the war began in 1975, 
the dollar was worth 2.5 Lebanese pounds. Now it is worth about 900 and the gap 
is widening. 
</P>
<P>
But many residents say they are so tired of war that the expense of eating out 
is secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"After spending so many months in the shelters, I am not going to stay at home 
now. I will go out no matter what the prices are," said Karim Marrouche, a 
political science student at Beirut University College. 
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese don't carry a calculator with them all the time and count how much 
they are left with at the end of the month. . . . They just want to have fun," 
said Abu Ghazale, owner of a pizza house in West Beirut's Makhoul Street. 
</P>
<P>
"If prices keep increasing, people will cut on saving and other expenses to go 
out -- especially for food." 
</P>
<P>
Beirut was famous for its varied cuisine and night life until the war emptied 
the restaurants, nightclubs and hotels, which had been frequented by tens of 
thousands of tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's lifestyle crumbled and West Beirut, the main attraction, became a 
haven for assassins, kidnapers and gunmen who looted its tourist area and for 
three years transformed it into a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
Fear kept people indoors and by night West Beirut was a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
Security has improved since a cease-fire in September, 1989, ended six months 
of savage artillery duels across the city divide between troops of Christian 
Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian forces and their local Muslim allies. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we can go out without being afraid a shell will hit us or militiamen 
will attack us," said law student Kamal Hattoum.

The Warsaw Pact will hold a summit in Hungary early next month on the future of 
the Soviet-led military alliance following the collapse of communism in Eastern 
Europe, Soviet sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 3-4 meeting in Budapest of the alliance, cut from seven to six members 
by East Germany's absorption into NATO as part of a united Germany, will 
discuss the group's military future, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the summit, formally known as a meeting of the pact's 
Political Consultative Committee and normally attended by heads of state, will 
probably be the last, now that the East-West Cold War is over. 
</P>
<P>
Warsaw Pact commanders discussed the summit Thursday in Bucharest during a 
regular session of the pact's military council, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact groups the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, 
Romania and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
All except the Soviet Union have replaced communist regimes with freely elected 
governments committed to building parliamentary democracy and a market economy.

ITALY SHOCKED BY ORGANIZED CRIME KILLING OF CHILDREN;

Twelve-year-old Andrea Esposito was in the wrong place at the wrong time and it 
cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
One morning in September he witnessed a brutal Mafia ambush in a seedy 
wholesale produce market near Naples, where he worked unloading fruit crates 
before school to help his family get by. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting the man they had come to kill, the gunmen -- from a clan of the 
Camorra, the Naples region branch of the Mafia -- turned their attention to 
those who had seen them. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Andrea's tender age might have saved him. He might have got away 
with an icy warning to keep his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
As Andrea huddled in a corner crying out for mercy, one of the killers put a 
gun to the boy's head and fired twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Mafia and its offshoots have killed children before in their long and 
violent history. But such killings were rare. They were often by-products of 
attacks targeted at others and the Mafia went to great pains to keep such 
killings quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the masterpieces of the Mafia's self-generated public relations image 
has been to make people believe that its 'men of honor' kept women and children 
out of their conflicts," said sociologist Pino Arlacchi, an expert on the 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Andrea's execution, the second killing of a child by organized crime 
groups in two days, shocked and outraged a country largely inured to gangland 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The killing of children now occurs with much greater frequency and there is no 
attempt to hide it," Arlacchi said. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before, 8-year-old Paolo Longobardi died when a gunman who had come to 
kill the boy's father sprayed their bedroom window with shots from a hunting 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
No longer concerned about a facade of honor, the killers now make no effort to 
make sure children or other witnesses are not in the way when they attack their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Paolo and his father were the latest victims of a gangland feud between two 
Camorra clans in Castellamare di Stabia, south of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea and the Longobardis were among 10 people killed in a rash of Camorra 
violence in a 72-hour period. Nearly 160 have died this year. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the spiraling violence stems from the breakdown of the Camorra's two 
monolithic umbrella families into 106 rival clans fighting to control lucrative 
drug trafficking, extortion and smuggling rackets. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, big flare-ups in organized crime violence occurred cyclically, every 
generation or so, when the young members took over from the old chiefs," said 
Arlacchi. "Now these conflicts are continuous, with a much higher number of 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
After the killings of the children, Italy's national police chief Vincenzo 
Parisi -- usually a man of few words -- gave a flurry of television and 
newspaper interviews to assure the country that the forces of law had the 
situation under control. 
</P>
<P>
Parisi said the indiscriminate violence showed the Camorra was in a desperate 
panic because police were taking advantage of the break-up of the big families 
to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody agreed with Parisi's suggestion that the Camorra clans were going 
wild because they felt the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Sen. Rafaele Valensise demanded that either the government give top 
priority to organized crime or admit the failure of its current strategy and 
start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"If not even this recent ferocity and brutality by the clans can dislodge the 
state into making a commitment in places where organized crime strikes out in 
an indiscriminate way, that means there is little hope of winning this war," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The flare-up in the Naples area coincided with a burst of fresh violence in 
Calabria, where more than 200 people have been killed this year by the 
'Ndrangheta, the poor southern mainland region's version of the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
The violence in much of southern Italy has prompted the influential Roman 
Catholic Church to denounce organized crime with renewed vigor. 
</P>
<P>
"This concerted position of the church, these bishops, these priests, who speak 
out openly against the Mafia, this is truly something historically important," 
said Arlacchi. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, priests, bishops and cardinals urged Italians to cut 
the lifeline of organized crime by rebelling against "omerta," the Mafia's 
"code of silence." 
</P>
<P>
"Those mouths and eyes which have been shut by brutality must finally make us 
open our mouths and our eyes to speak and see for them," said Bishop Antonio 
Riboldi of Acerra, a Camorra-infested city near Naples. 
</P>
<P>
Rome Cardinal Ugo Poletti accused Italian political parties of weakening the 
fight against organized crime by bickering too much about strategy. 
</P>
<P>
At Naples' most significant religious event, the prayers for the "liquifaction 
miracle" of the blood of St. Gennaro, the city's patron, Cardinal Michele 
Giordano attacked the Camorra for the brutal deaths of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Riboldi, who travels with a police escort because of Camorra death 
threats, called for a new attitude among people living in Mafia strongholds to 
break the crime cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no more time to make believe we don't see and don't know," he said.

Thousands of campers in Yosemite National Park began getting the bad news 
Saturday morning. Because of the federal budget stalemate, all campsites in the 
park will be closed at 1 p.m. today, although the Ahwahnee Hotel, Yosemite 
Lodge and other facilities operated by the Curry Co. will remain open, as will 
the visitor center with a reduced staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We are technically closed right now but the gates are still open because it's 
difficult to close Yosemite in a short period of time," said Park Ranger Bob 
Clopine. "We're confused but we're making the best of a difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
For most Californians, there were few such problems Saturday because the vast 
majority of federal agencies were closed for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Some part-time workers for the U.S. Census Bureau even put in a day of overtime 
as they rushed to complete the field work for the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Winston, a Census Bureau district manager in Panorama City, said he and 11 
others were told Friday to report to work Saturday regardless of what problems 
Congress was having with the budget. "I don't know if we're going to get paid, 
but we have to assume they know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, visitors to the Cabrillo National Monument, a popular tourist 
destination, were dismayed to find that the federal shutdown had prompted 
short-staffed managers to close the seaside park. 
</P>
<P>
"What is surprising is the number of visitors we turned away who had no idea 
this was going on," said Mark Anderson, ranger at the site, which is named in 
honor of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, the Portuguese explorer who was the first 
European to sail into San Diego Bay. "We've dropped down to the minimum 
essential crew needed for caretaking the monument." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in San Diego, however, the federal budget crunch seemed to have 
little impact. Essential services remained in place, lessening the potential 
for disruption. 
</P>
<P>
No unusual delays were reported through the afternoon at Lindbergh Field, the 
principal airport. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Border Patrol, which has more than 800 employees in the San Diego 
area, the nation's largest such contingent, was also said to be conducting 
normal operations. 
</P>
<P>
The usual weekend delays were 
</P>
<P>
present along the two U.S.-Mexico border crossings between San Diego and 
Tijuana, but no usual backups were reported. The border facilities are manned 
by federal immigration and customs personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a normal Saturday," said Alicia Williams, operations supervisor at the 
San Ysidro port of entry, the world's busiest international crossing. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center at Angeles National Forest remained open thanks to a budget 
surplus that will allow it and those at other national forests in California to 
continue operations until Oct. 15. "After that, God only knows," said Ranger 
Gerry Reponen from the Chilao Visitor Center. 
</P>
<P>
The budget deadlock, however, touched Southern Californians in small ways. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Golden, first vice president of Seniors for Action, a senior citizens 
political action group, said a toll-free number available to "tell Congress 
exactly how we feel" was not in service. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center was closed at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area and scheduled nature hikes for hundreds of weekend visitors were canceled, 
although the area was open to those who wanted to hike on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands National Park visitor center in Ventura also was closed. 
Private boat operators are still providing tours of the islands, but park 
rangers will not guide the tours. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center in Sequoia National Park was closed and all naturalists 
talks and hikes were canceled. The campgrounds remained open. Because of the 
reduction in services, however, no entrance fees were being collected. 
</P>
<P>
At Yosemite, visited by 3.4 million people last year, park entrances were kept 
open and rangers continued to collect fees, although visitors were being warned 
that services were limited. 
</P>
<P>
Guided walks and ranger programs have been halted, Yosemite's Clopine said. And 
if Congress fails to find a budget solution by this afternoon, the campgrounds 
will be closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean I came all the way from Ohio and I can't go backpacking?" Robbi 
Young, 32, of Cincinnati said after Ranger Bob Slimak explained the budget 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Write your congressman when you get back to Ohio," Slimak responded. 
</P>
<P>
Young and her friend, George Carman, 33, of San Diego, had hoped to go on a 
backpacking trip to Little Yosemite Valley this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The 550 employees of the park have been told to report to work Tuesday, 
following the Columbus Day holiday, when they will find out whether they will 
continue working or be put on furlough. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Patrick McDonnell, Terry Rather, Mayerene Barker and Psyche 
Pascual contributed to this story.

EMIGRES HELP SET UP JOURNALISM SCHOOL

<P>
Two Romanian expatriates are trying to help cool passions that linger after the 
revolution by teaching Western journalism to reporters who never had to 
distinguish fact from fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Under Nicolae Ceausescu, Communist authorities replaced the journalism 
department at Bucharest University with an indoctrination course for party 
officials, to make sure that the propaganda machine ran smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
The result, even after the dictator was overthrown and executed in December, is 
a polarized press that often inflames the public. 
</P>
<P>
What passes for news is a one-sided mix of opinion sprinkled with a few facts. 
Pro-government and opposition papers are equally guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesmen claim that the opposition shames Romania. The independent 
daily Romania Libera began a recent response: "So we don't want the good of the 
country?" 
</P>
<P>
A new five-part journalism course being given at the League of Human Rights 
headquarters in Bucharest is the brainchild of expatriate Gabriel Nicolescou, 
an architect who founded the Romanian Freedom Forum in Chicago and publishes a 
Romanian-English monthly called Democratic Romania. 
</P>
<P>
His partner, 28-year-old Michael Maldarescu, finances the course from profits 
generated by his new telephone news line in Chicago, Inside Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Irish journalist Sean Hillen, one of the several foreign teachers, said his 140 
students "still have trouble distinguishing between fact and opinion." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get them to understand that their opinions are irrelevant to 
objective reporting," he said, "but they are enthusiastic about journalism and 
learning about the world outside." 
</P>
<P>
His students, some of whom worked in the state-controlled media under 
Ceausescu, recognize the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Events in Romania caused the reporting to be out of passion and journalists 
took sides," said Mariana Trifian, 27. "The course will help eliminate that. I 
feel now that I will be able to control myself. . . . It would be better for 
the people to read objective reporting." 
</P>
<P>
Hennelise Koch, 26, said readers raised on the old journalism are part of the 
problem. She said they "need to be taught to read an objective newspaper and 
not be looking for political allegiances." 
</P>
<P>
Maldarescu said the course, "tries to teach potential journalists here what 
Western journalism is all about . . . so they see why it is that, if you took 
any article that appeared in a Romanian paper and tried to publish it in the 
West, it just wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Hillen said students are taught everything from layout to writing leads and 
headlines, and how to conduct interviews for various media. 
</P>
<P>
A recent class posed this problem: 
</P>
<P>
"If you had a six-hour deadline to write an article about adoption and you knew 
absolutely nothing about the subject, what would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
The lecturer was Catherine Adams, a reporter for Independent Radio Network and 
United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
Maldarescu said the course is accredited by the Romanian government and he is 
working on a plan for making it an associate of arts degree program recognized 
by U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the school and his telephone news line, "will enable a 
flow of information from here to there and the other way around so that 
Romanians begin to understand a little better the concept of a free market and 
society, and we begin to understand the situation in Romania."

ROMANIA ABORTIONS SOAR SINCE THE REVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CEAUSESCU HAD BANNED THE PROCEDURE TO BOOST THE BIRTH RATE. TODAY, 
ABORTION COSTS AS LITTLE AS $2 -- BUT CONTRACEPTIVES ARE UNAVAILABLE OR 
EXPENSIVE.

<P>
Nearly 500,000 women have had an abortion since the overthrow of dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu, who had banned the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Health authorities are offering contraceptives and sex education, but they are 
stymied by an ignorance of contraception and an indifferent attitude toward 
abortion, which costs less than $2 in some places. 
</P>
<P>
Under Ceausescu, who was obsessed with increasing Romania's population of 23 
million, contraception was unknown and abortion, with few exceptions, was 
prohibited. Women were obliged to undergo periodic examinations to ensure they 
were not hiding a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
They resorted to illegal, back-shop abortions, many performed in primitive 
conditions. Some died, and tens of thousands of unwanted children still 
languish in ill-equipped orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and patients caught by police were subject to prison terms, and 
restrictive laws made couples distrustful of contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
That attitude has outlived Ceausescu, who was executed with his wife, Elena, on 
Dec. 25 and replaced by a more moderate leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I would rather have an abortion than use condoms," declared one 
woman in a recent interview with state television. Most of the other women on 
the program agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Sorin Puia, founder of the new volunteer Society for Sexual Education, said 
many women come to abortion clinics too late. 
</P>
<P>
"Many women continue to resort to self-inflicted abortions," he said. "Hundreds 
have been mutilated." 
</P>
<P>
Romania produces only a small percentage of the condoms and other 
contraceptives it needs, and foreign-made contraceptives are expensive on the 
black market, often out of reach of most Romanians' budgets. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, abortions are inexpensive and available on demand. 
</P>
<P>
"The former government did not want anyone to know anything about sex 
education," said Emil Tomescu, deputy minister of health. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry has responded by initiating a family-planning program, including 
instruction on how to get and use condoms. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which includes both direct instruction and television and radio 
ads, is administered by educators and gynecologists offering free advice on 
methods from the pill to the IUD. 
</P>
<P>
"It involves more than just sex life; it also means making financial and other 
decisions . . . and we hope we can improve health standards in this country," 
Tomescu said. "We do not expect spectacular, immediate success." 
</P>
<P>
As the official program struggles to get off the ground, the number of 
abortions continues to soar. According to a recent report in the 
mass-circulation daily Adevarul, more than 1 million abortions have been 
performed since January. 
</P>
<P>
Serban Nicolescu, the Health Ministry's inspector-general, said the actual 
figure is lower. He estimates 440,000 women, or one in 10 of child-bearing age, 
have aborted pregnancies in that time. 
</P>
<P>
The population-growth project and Ceausescu's other schemes, such as the 
eradication of the country's peasant villages, ended with his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
But the effects of his disastrous social and economic policies are still 
evident everywhere, including the poor quality and chronic undersupply of 
locally made condoms and the severe shortage of powdered milk for babies. 
</P>
<P>
General lack of knowledge about sex has also led to an increase in acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. Ceausescu banned discussing the consequences of the 
disease by simply claiming it did not exist in Romania, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
It will take some time before the total number of AIDS cases due to unsafe sex 
will become known, said the ministry's anti-AIDS coordinator, Florin Popovici. 
Since January, about 60 new adult cases have been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other roughly 800 AIDS patients in Romania are children who 
contracted the killer disease primarily through blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the government contracted with a local company to produce 30 million 
condoms. But this supply, even when it hits the market, is estimated by 
family-planning officials to last no more than several months in a country of 
Romania's population. 
</P>
<P>
Local condoms cost about 5 cents and donated condoms, as well as diaphragms, 
have only recently been made available through hospitals and clinics. Few 
people, however, know about donated contraceptives, and the process of getting 
them can be complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Puia decried the continuing "lack of sanitary and sexual education among youth, 
students and workers." 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't informed," he said. "The clinics are assaulted daily by dozens of 
women" who come for abortions, many too late in the pregnancy.

'WHAT'S ORGANIC' PUZZLES FARMERS, CONSUMERS

The poster on Christine and Dale Johnson's kitchen wall reads, "Our Veggies 
Don't Do Drugs." 
</P>
<P>
A jar on the kitchen table holds wasp eggs, future natural predators to be used 
instead of pesticides against the tomato hornworm -- "a nasty critter, a 
voracious eater," Christine Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons run an organic farm, growing peppers, squash, kale, cherry 
tomatoes, eggplant, lettuce and other produce on their 65 acres on the eastern 
shore of Chesapeake Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Many people tell opinion surveys they are willing to pay more for organic food, 
grown without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
But growers, retailers, consumer groups and environmentalists say the organic 
food industry has been handicapped by the lack of consistent national standards 
to answer the question: What is organic food? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the consumer has the right to the assurance that the organic label 
means something," Christine Johnson said. "The consumer can often be deceived 
(and) possibly pay more for a product that's no better than another." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two states -- including California -- have regulations defining organic 
farming. They all follow the same basic idea, but no two are identical. In 
other states organic farms are certified by private organizations, applying 
their own standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic agriculture is a funny word. Organic by definition in Webster's would 
just be carbon-based," said Joseph Dunsmoor, founder of the organic food 
distributor Organic Farms in Beltsville, Md. "You can say organic agriculture 
means you don't use farm chemicals. It's a whole lot more than that." 
</P>
<P>
But what? 
</P>
<P>
This year Congress is taking a stab at an answer. The House and Senate both 
approved programs for nationwide organic farming standards as part of the 1990 
farm bill. 
</P>
<P>
The conference committee that will resolve differences between the two bills is 
waiting for approval of the budget deal so it knows how much money has to be 
cut from farm-support programs, but the organic provisions are expected to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Organically produced food defies simple definition," the Senate Agriculture 
Committee said when it adopted its version. So a complicated definition was 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Organic food is food produced using sustainable production methods that rely 
primarily on natural materials," the committee began. There are exceptions -- 
some synthetic chemicals traditionally accepted in organic farming, and a few 
natural substances so toxic they are banned. 
</P>
<P>
Those exceptions are to be spelled out in a list drawn up by a National Organic 
Standards Board, to be made up of organic farmers, wholesalers and retailers, 
consumer representatives and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Rules for raising organic meat and poultry are even more confusing than for 
vegetables. It's left to the standards board to figure out what livestock 
medications, vaccines and parasiticides are to be legal for organic farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, shoppers should be seeing U.S. government-certified organic 
chickens, tomatoes and bell peppers in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation allows for state and private organizations to do the inspection 
and certification, so long as they follow the national standards. States also 
would be permitted to enact stricter standards, if they wished, but could not 
block imports of nationally certified organic food from other states. 
</P>
<P>
The organic-farming provisions were backed vigorously by lobbyists from 
environmental groups, who say overuse of chemical pesticides, fungicides and 
fertilizers is polluting streams and endangering farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical manufacturers reject any suggestion their products are unsafe, but 
approve the idea of nationwide standards for organic agriculture, said 
Christopher Klose, spokesman for the National Agricultural Chemicals Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The small but growing organic farm industry also supported the plan for 
nationwide standards and labeling. 
</P>
<P>
"For both the consumer and the grower, there are going to be multiple benefits. 
It makes marketing much easier," said Marty Rice, co-director of the Maryland 
Organic Food and Farming Assn., which was founded last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Johnson, driving boxes of organic kale in from his fields in a white 
pickup, said he hoped the government-approved organic labels will boost the 
market for organic foods. 
</P>
<P>
"People say they want it and are willing to pay more for it, but that hasn't 
translated into a bigger market on the East Coast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets, however, report falling interest in organic foods. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of consumers will buy it one time for the novelty, but the repeat sales 
don't seem to be there," said Nancy Yanish, director of agricultural relations 
for the Food Marking Institute in Washington. "If consumers want it, 
supermarkets will be glad to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
Two major grocery chains in the Washington area, Giant and Safeway, once had 
organic produce sections in some of their stores. Both dropped the idea in the 
last year after disappointing sales. 
</P>
<P>
The trade weekly Supermarket News reported similar experiences nationwide, 
asking in an article last May, "Is organic produce withering on the vine?" 
</P>
<P>
Organic farm organizations, however, report their production up by as much as 
40% over last year. Stores specializing in natural and organic foods seem to be 
doing fairly well, even if organic sales in regular supermarkets are slumping. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five years we've gone from a fad to a clear market niche," said 
Bob Scowcroft, executive director of the California Certified Organic Farmers. 
"The establishment of national standards will allow our growers to compete 
fairly in all 50 states."

HERITAGE: THE ACOMAS' POTTERY AND FESTIVALS RECALL A CENTURIES-OLD WAY OF LIFE. 
SKY CITY, THEIR HOME, HAS A RICH, SOMETIMES VIOLENT HISTORY.

SKY CITY, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autumn chill hangs over Sky City, a sun-hardened citadel of clay and rock 
that is said to be the oldest continuously occupied community in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, hundreds of Indian dancers and potters displayed their talents 
as the Acoma Pueblo community observed the 350th annual San Esteban Feast Day 
with sprinklings of cornmeal to bless the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, most Acomas returned to their homes in the valley below. But a few, 
mostly potters, are staying on for the windy winter atop this sandstone 
stronghold 7,000 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
"Up here on top of the mesa, there are 12 to 15 families that live all year 
long," said Camille Pasquale, a potter who helps guide tourists through the 
ancient fortress, which survived a 16th-Century Spanish invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Survival cost dearly -- 100 men killed, scores enslaved and many others 
punished by having a foot severed. 
</P>
<P>
It's quiet now. The stillness soaks up sound. Voices 10 feet away vanish like 
steam. A little boy, following his dog down narrow lanes, shyly sneaks glances 
at strangers. Every other doorway displays pottery. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, the tribe chooses "field chiefs" who live here with their families, 
each generally representing one of the Acomas' 14 clans. 
</P>
<P>
The Acomas say they have been here more than 1,000 years. They first settled on 
neighboring Enchanted Mesa, which was later abandoned, and then 800 years ago 
moved to Sky City, a 367-foot-high mesa that was declared a national landmark 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Water is still carried in, not piped. No wires bring in phone calls or 
electricity. No gas lines here. 
</P>
<P>
Like the ancient timbers used in the village's 17th-Century San Esteban Mission 
Church, the firewood for heating and cooking is hauled here from as far away as 
Mt. Taylor, 40 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
San Esteban Feast Day, the Acomas' big fall celebration, marked the end of the 
hot weather and the summer tourist season that brought in 200 to 300 visitors a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 2, a procession carried the carved wooden statue of St. Stephen from 
his church on the southwest corner of the mesa to a shrine on the central 
plaza. The shrine, as always, was decorated with cuttings of corn, aspen and 
wild daisies, flanked by guards bearing muskets dating back more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the shrine, tribal leaders formally accepted the Acomas' offerings of 
food to the saint. 
</P>
<P>
Then the white-buffalo dancers, each carrying a multicolored lightning bolt, 
began their celebration, their bells and silver jewelry jangling. Three men in 
white animal skins, skirts and brown leather leggings and three women in 
wrapped white buckskin leggings and floral print shifts, black skirts and white 
sash vests danced to the beat of a single drummer. 
</P>
<P>
Following them, a succession of other troupes entered in turn from different 
corners of the square, two by two, each performing in front of the shrine -- 
the women with large red dots on their cheekbones, the men with rust-colored 
swabs, for protection. Fox pelts dangled from their belts. Fir boughs adorned 
their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
The church dominates the southwest corner of the mesa. The Acoma women helped 
Franciscan missionaries complete it from 1629 to 1640, just as they prepare it 
every year for the fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
"The women and children brought the sand from the valley up in baskets," said 
Fran Torivio, a Sky City guide and cashier at the Acoma office below. 
</P>
<P>
The walled courtyard in front of the church is a cemetery. The wall is topped 
with weathered adobe busts of warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the soldiers that guard the cemetery," Pasquale said. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers are restored annually before the fiesta with new potsherds for 
their eyes, and new smiles carved into the clay. 
</P>
<P>
Acomas would lock themselves in the church when under attack by Navajos or 
Apaches, usually around harvest time, Torivio said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists still can climb down the ancient stairway carved in the mesa's 
northwest face, or they can ride a tour bus. 
</P>
<P>
Acomas say their ancestors arrived here from Mesa Verde in what is now southern 
Colorado. According to legend, they were told by Iatiku, mother of all Indians, 
to seek a mesa resembling the tip of an ear of corn, which symbolizes Iatiku. 
</P>
<P>
When they saw Enchanted Mesa, they believed they had arrived at the center of 
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
By various accounts, Enchanted Mesa was abandoned after earthquakes or 
rainstorms destroyed its ancient staircase, stranding a few residents on top. 
Some died jumping or falling, others starved. Most were already down on the 
valley floor, farming. They began anew at Sky City, leaving ruins on Enchanted 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Acomas say they've been at Sky City since about 1200. 
</P>
<P>
In 1540, Spaniards came looking vainly for gold in the fabled Seven Cities of 
Cibola. It is said that the golden glint of mica window panes reflecting the 
sunset attracted the Spaniards here. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought this was the seven cities of gold, and they could see shining 
stuff in the rocks, but it's all sandstone," Torivio said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan de Onate, Spanish governor of New Mexico, claimed the area for the king. 
The affable Acomas greeted him warmly in 1598, but eventually decided to 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
When Onate's nephew, Juan de Zaldivar, stopped here shortly afterward for 
provisions, he and 12 of his men were massacred. Zaldivar's brother, Vicente, 
with a force of 70 men, quickly avenged their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 100 Acoma men slain, 60 young girls were taken to Mexico as slaves, 
and the young men and women who remained here also were kept in servitude. Each 
adult man had a foot severed. 
</P>
<P>
In the succeeding century, the Indians sometimes took their frustrations out on 
priests, throwing a couple of clerics off the cliff behind the church. But the 
area has been peaceful since 1690. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish is not a language the Acomas generally speak, although many have 
Spanish surnames. They speak Keresan, an ancient Pueblo tongue, and English. 
</P>
<P>
Most Acomas today live in villages such as Acomita and McCartys in the 30 miles 
between Sky City and Interstate 40, about 50 miles west of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
"Our total population is about 4,000 people, but they live in other villages 
because our other villages have electricity and running water," Torivio said. 
"That's where we have all the modern homes. That's where we have the TV, the 
shower and the microwave." 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, Acoma potters got their clay from the mountains and mixed in 
ground-up shards from old pots. They made their pots by hand and fired them in 
wood-fueled adobe kilns. 
</P>
<P>
Though many potters today use ready-made ware fired in electric kilns, the 
designs are still authentic Acoma. The Acoma style is known for its fine-line 
designs, painted with yucca-stem brushes. 
</P>
<P>
The yucca stem is chewed so that a few fibers form a primitive brush. The fewer 
the fibers, the finer the brush line. The thin, repetitive lines represent rain 
-- until recently the Acomas' only source of water, collected in natural rock 
cisterns around the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
During the peak tourism periods of summer, 20 to 30 potters sell their wares 
here, including Sky City's oldest resident, Concepcion Faustine, who is at 
least 80. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here since 1909," she said in halting English. Mostly, she speaks 
Keresan. This day, she is selling Indian fry bread and small handmade pots 
painted with brown and black designs. 
</P>
<P>
Potters still pray to Clay Woman before starting a pot. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Torivio, no relation to Fran Torivio, majored in business administration 
at the College of Santa Fe and now she and husband Mike run the family 
pottery-making business. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes the pots for me, and I do the design," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But being a field chief, a clan representative chosen to live for a year at Sky 
City, has cut into Mike's pottery-making, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie and Mike Torivio have a house in McCartys. 
</P>
<P>
"I go down weekly to check my answering machine and get the mail and do 
laundry, all the things that we don't have up here," she said.

North Korea has protested against "unceasing provocative acts" by soldiers of 
the U.S.-led United Nations force at the border village of Panmunjom, the North 
Korean Central News Agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The protest at alleged provocations in Panmunjom's joint security area was made 
by the senior member of the North Korean delegation to the Military Armistice 
Commission in a message to his U.S. counterpart, said KCNA, monitored in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The message accused U.N. guards of "shouting and making unseemly gestures" at 
North Korean personnel on three occasions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The guards obstructed the performance of duty by northern personnel Wednesday 
and Thursday, "turning on a flashlight toward our personnel on scores of 
times," it said. 
</P>
<P>
KCNA quoted the northern representative as saying the U.N. force was 
"committing more malicious provocations, infiltrating fighter planes into our 
airspace and scattering many copies of propaganda literatures against the North 
in the joint security area."

Zambian troops killed five rebels and captured one member of the Mozambique 
National Resistance Movement who ambushed a bus in the country's eastern 
province this week, a local paper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The official Zambia Daily Mail, quoting witnesses, said the right-wing rebels 
were killed Tuesday by troops patrolling in civilian vehicles after the rebels 
had shot at the tires of a bus carrying 70 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Security officials in Zambia declined to comment on Tuesday's incident.

Kaye Hunter has stopped watching the news -- it scares and depresses her too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Six-year-old Kenneth cries for his daddy when his mother, Barrie Leonard, wakes 
him in the morning for school. And every night, Kenneth wants his mother to 
show him on the globe which part of the ocean his father's ship reached that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunters and Leonards, like other families, are trying to collect their 
lives after husbands and wives departed on the San Diego-based Acadia, sailing 
for the Middle East to assist in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
For the families, the departure was abrupt -- the destroyer tender was not 
scheduled to leave until January. While the ship is at sea, there are no 
telephone calls. Almost instantly, letters have become their only means of 
staying in touch. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times published letters from families to those who shipped out. 
These are some of the letters home. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye Hunter read in a letter that her husband was issued his own gas mask and 
she felt the fear tighten her throat. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh God, I tell you, it's been a nightmare," said Hunter, ombudswoman for the 
Acadia. "Being fitted for gas masks really brings home the reality that this is 
different. But he writes about it so calmly." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Petty Officer John Timothy Hunter, 37, has been in the Navy almost 17 
years and has shipped out on deployments before. But this one has shaken the 
family like no other. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye Hunter has decided not to cook Thanksgiving dinner because she cannot bear 
her husband's absence at the table. She sees other couples holding hands and 
she feels sad and lonely. The prospect of Christmas shopping depresses her 
since she is trying to figure out a gift small enough to mail and keeps finding 
items far too big. 
</P>
<P>
Her 13-year-old son, John, wants to wear his father's blue plaid bathrobe, 
which still carries the scent of aftershave. But every time he does, it only 
serves as a painful reminder. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I bury my face in that bathrobe. I won't wash it until he comes 
home," said Kaye Hunter, 39. "It's all the little things. You find yourself 
turning to talk to someone who is not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Kaye &amp; John, 5 Sept. 90 
</P>
<P>
 I was trying my best not to get sobby before I had to go onto the ship, 
however I should have known I was fighting a losing battle. It has only been 
seven hours since we left San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 I got my things moved into Master Chief's old desk and cleared out (the rest) 
... I can actually see the desk now. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay, you and John really mean the world to me and both of you held in there 
very admirably while waiting with me on the pier. You know it's hard to write 
with tears in ones eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is going to be a Captain's call in about 1 1/2 hours and if anything 
important is said, I will put it into print. However, by the time you read it, 
it will be history, oh well! 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have a clue as to how long we will be anchored or where we will go. 
The likelihood of us going into the Gulf is very slim!! 
</P>
<P>
 How are you and John doing? Are you getting a lot of phone calls? Have you 
checked the oil in the van? Well, I am running out of things to write about so 
I will close with telling you how much I love you. I love you more than all the 
ghost balls under John's bed. No, wait! More than that, more than all the 
grains of sand at Black Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Love ya lots, Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Kaye, 7 Sept. 90 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday, during General Quarters, Chief Lentz discovered that number 1 air 
conditioner had developed ruptured chiller tubes. Once the chain of command was 
informed of this, a plan of action involving the repair department was started. 
The general workshop guys worked through the night...They also had to swap out 
two 400-pound motors. 
</P>
<P>
 We had General Quarters (G.Q.) again on Friday night and I didn't get to bed 
until around 11:30 p.m. The safety stand down was more for the new people 
assigned than anything else. At 0800, I had an appointment at the dental office 
and got out of one of the lectures. The (dentist) who looked at my teeth said 
they look very good and I only needed to schedule a cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, we had another G.Q., we have the new gas masks that are our 
own personal issue. The new masks are designed differently and are more bulky 
than the old masks. 
</P>
<P>
 We will retard clocks again tonight one hour. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Petty Officer Brandstadter and myself were talking about how hard it is 
leaving on an extended deployment and how much harder this one is than last 
because of such short notice. I hope and pray that everything is going 
smoothely and that you are o.k.! 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't forget that I love you, Tim 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. How is John doing? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barrie Leonard imagines the Acadia's return and how her husband will look 
dressed in his white uniform as he steps across the brow. She thinks about how 
her son Kenneth will jump up and down on the pier. She figures that 6-month-old 
Johnathan will probably be walking by then. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot about when the ship gets back," said Barrie Leonard, 30. "It's 
like a movie that plays in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Her marriage to Arrington Leonard, 35, a petty officer 2nd class, has been 
stormy. But in the months before the Acadia's departure, the couple had 
rejuvenated their relationship, she said. And because of that, his letters take 
on a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for the letters; I look for signs that he is consistent, for some kind 
of reassurance that everything is OK and that he is keeping the faith," Barrie 
Leonard said. "My focus is more on the marriage surviving." 
</P>
<P>
She tries not to think about the possibility of war because it frightens her 
so. Instead, she plans what the family will do -- a trip to Disneyland -- when 
her husband comes home. And she tries to console Kenneth, who is going to 
school for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell him 'one month down, five to go' -- that makes it sound shorter than if 
I say 'four weeks down, 40 left,' " Barrie Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
But her son is uneasy. Because his father charged him with making sure his 
mother locks the windows and doors, he wakes in the night and pads into her 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget to lock the door," he tells her.

Hi My Darling, 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I finally got some paper to write on, at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 I pray that you are well and the boys haven't been too hard on you. 
</P>
<P>
 I am doing good. I am reading my Daily Bread, going to meetings, listening to 
my good music, and I started the verse memory book today. I feel real good 
about memorizing verses. I feel confident I will do okay... 
</P>
<P>
 I have been working out and taking the (nutrition) powder stuff. It is working 
out okay as I have been blessed with a workout partner and companion. My new 
acquaintance Tony and I are getting to know one another. During the G.Q. drill 
the other day we talked about women, cars, our early days as children, religion 
and even about our ideas about being faithful to our partners. Even though he 
is not a Christian, we have the exact thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Tony around to talk with has made these few days more bearable and the 
outlook for the remainder of the cruise is brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 I miss you and the boys terribly and I am anxious to hear your voice and to 
talk with the boys. I haven't watched the tape of the boys yet, I am saving it 
for later on. . . 
</P>
<P>
 I did as you asked, I put our names in lights on the mess deck and have some 
congrats and happy birthdays. Yes, your name is there about our 10 year 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 I love you. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the sixth of Sept. was a good day for you as it just didn't seem the 
same to me. If you don't mind we can celebrate that day over when I return. 
</P>
<P>
 I am running out of things to say so I will write a few words to Kenny then 
sign off. Keep the faith. I am. I love you. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny, 
</P>
<P>
 I love you and miss you very much. A verse to study and remember: 
</P>
<P>
 I CAN DO EVERYTHING THROUGH HIM WHO GIVES ME STRENGTH. Philippians 4:13 
</P>
<P>
 Daddy is memorizing verses. WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. I WILL SEND MORE TO SHARE 
WITH YOU. 
</P>
<P>
 love, Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14 Sept. 90 0141 Hrs. 
</P>
<P>
Hi My Darling, 
</P>
<P>
 Another day has passed and as I sit around and listen to Randy Stonehill, I 
remember how we had listened to the tape together before we had to separate and 
I really miss you dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 After I talked with you, I came back to the ship at about two o'clock and I 
napped til four. I had some training at 4:15 and I really didn't want to get 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting here I have had thoughts about what I have been doing to myself. . . I 
have been using cigarettes to beat myself up. As you know, the addict inside 
wants to be liked by everyone and when that doesn't happen, I always blame 
myself. Then I am not okay and I don't like myself. . .I won't let it happen 
any longer!... 
</P>
<P>
 It sure was nice to hear your voice, and also Kenny's. I wonder how Kenny is 
really feeling inside and how he is taking it. 
</P>
<P>
 I know God has a plan for me and my growth. . .I will start praying for God to 
ease my pain from wanting to be liked by all and to concentrate on God's 
love... 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting late and I still want to write a few lines to Uncle Ken, so will 
close here. 
</P>
<P>
 I will write more, but please don't expect to get daily writings. I love you 
and am still faithful. Please give Ken and Johnathan hugs and kisses from 
daddy. XXXXOOOO 
</P>
<P>
 All my love, Len 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 Sept. 90 
</P>
<P>
Dear Kenny, 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that you are OK. I would like to hear about your first day at school. 
Please let me know in a letter. I really miss you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't wait to talk to you. I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. GIVE JOHNATHAN HUGS AND 
KISSES FROM DADDY. 
</P>
<P>
 I WILL WRITE AGAIN SOON! 
</P>
<P>
 LOVE, DADDY

FACE HOMOSEXUALITY WITH FACTS, NOT FEAR; 
</P>
<P>
PREJUDICE: MOTHER WISHES SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HER SON'S 
SEXUALITY 25 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AGNES HERMAN, Agnes Herman lives in San Marcos.

<TEXT>
<P>
If homosexuality had been understood, rather than feared, 25 years ago, our 
son, Jeff, would not have felt compelled to lock himself in a dark closet for 
secrecy. At 18, he confided in no one, ran from school to job to anonymity and, 
finally, to our home in the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
If homosexuality had been acknowledged as reality, rather than ignored as 
taboo, perhaps our son would not have been on a collision course on the 
freeways and in our living room. He had numerous accidents and we had even more 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
If homosexuals had been regarded as ordinary members of the community, rather 
than persecuted as misfits, perhaps our daughter, Judi, would not have become 
hysterical when she learned of her brother's gayness. To this day, she weeps in 
fear for him. 
</P>
<P>
If homosexuality did not raise threatening questions to men and women of 
ignorance, I would not have nightmares about gay bashing and hassling, about 
skinheads and rednecks. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a child, homosexuality was not included in polite conversation, and 
thus, could not be understood. When Judi and Jeff were children, it was 
included in conversation long enough to be ridiculed and rejected. 
</P>
<P>
When we confronted our son's gayness more than 21 years ago, the rejection and 
the ridicule, the fears and the hysteria converged. "Of course we love you, 
son, but we hate what you are doing with your life!" 
</P>
<P>
What a preposterous conflict, spoken in heat and darkness, love and terror. My 
husband and I, possessors of half a dozen university degrees between us, knew 
nothing about homosexuality, except its myths, and were snug and smug in our 
ignorance. We responded to our son's cry for help from the depths of that 
mythology. We sent him to a therapist expecting that -- abracadabra -- he would 
be changed into a conforming heterosexual. He was not; it does not happen. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that you never get to know anyone until you live with that person. I 
can honestly say you don't know (spell that "understand") homosexuality until 
you live with it. Those who wish to misunderstand me can protest that I am 
advocating a homosexual liaison to achieve understanding. Wrong! We must allow 
the word, the idea, the concept and the people into our minds and our hearts: 
live with them, study them, worry with them, absorb them. 
</P>
<P>
The first fact we will learn is that no one chooses to live a homosexual 
lifestyle. Who would choose rejection over acceptance, a slap over a hug? We 
are not talking experimentation here, we are discussing lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have not discovered a single, clearly defined cause of sexual 
orientation: biology or chemistry; heredity or environment; a combination of 
all four, perhaps; but choice is not a scientific option. One may choose to be 
celibate or sexually active, but the attraction that one person has for another 
does not have an objectively definable origin. 
</P>
<P>
When our grown son reminisced: "I knew I was different as a kid but I did not 
know why . . . I preferred to be like all the others, but I didn't know how," 
choice never entered the discussion. Handsome, friendly and attractive, Jeff 
had girlfriends, slept with some, hated it all, but continued to try to conform 
until he matured into an understanding of himself. 
</P>
<P>
We can help our gay children out of the closet into society's mainstream, to 
participate as equals in school and at work. We can encourage them to make 
career and social choices without the coloration of rejection and ostracism. 
</P>
<P>
But we cannot do it alone. They must know that the world of their peers is 
supportive and not hostile; that their teachers' patience will not run out when 
she/he suspects a nonconformer; that their clergymen and women will be kind, 
sensitive and unpunishing; that there will be no graffiti and no unsavory jokes 
from friends, family and strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Where do we begin to make first-class citizens of our gay children? 
</P>
<P>
When the San Diego city school teachers, nurses and counselors recently met to 
learn how to help students with their curiosity and fears concerning 
homosexuality, Virginia Uribe, a prominent counselor to homosexual students, 
explained, "We are trying to demystify the whole subject of homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
For the parents who fear that education will promote homosexuality or encourage 
-- even seduce -- their children into the gay lifestyle, the facts will 
dissuade them, if they listen. Supporting children in their efforts to confront 
their own realities does not lead to AIDS. A truly enlightened system that will 
help children understand homosexuality will also help them understand how to 
avoid AIDS and will guarantee their being far more knowledgeable than their 
parents and, inevitably, more healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, Sigmund Freud wrote to a troubled mother, "Homosexuality is assuredly 
no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it 
cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it a variation of the sexual 
function. . . ." In 1973, the American Psychiatric Assn. caught up with Freud 
and took homosexuality off the "illness" list. 
</P>
<P>
It is time now for the rest of us to catch up. We can destroy the distortions 
of mythology with a massive attack of facts.

'GIVEAWAY' QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council has just approved one of the biggest giveaways in 
city history: The agreement between the city and McMillin/BCE governing 
development around Miramar Lake ("Deal Clears Way For Limited Miramar Lake 
Development," Sept. 19). 
</P>
<P>
While the local press has meekly portrayed this agreement as a constructive 
compromise between the developer and the Scripps Ranch community, the truth is 
that taxpayers, already hassled Interstate 15 commuters, environmentalists, and 
even prospective home buyers in the rest of the city will suffer dearly. 
</P>
<P>
First, the developer has been handed a $24-million credit toward paying 
citywide impact fees. We taxpayers will pick up this tab either through higher 
taxes or, more likely, reduced public services. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the entire development was completely exempted from the environmental 
protections offered by the city's Resource Protection Overlay Zone. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the council approved a precedent-setting $55-million Mello-Roos bond for 
the project. This tricky form of financing for public facilities and 
infrastructure will make it far easier for McMillin to pass the costs of the 
new development on to home buyers, rather than bear its fair share. 
</P>
<P>
Finally and most ironically, despite this massive giveaway to the developer, 
the agreement still allows for significant development on the view shed of 
Miramar Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains: Why did the council vote to approve this giveaway over 
the objections of both the city attorney and the city manager? It's a question 
for which no adequate answer has been forthcoming.

WHICH IS ROACHE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been closely following the sheriff's race, as I feel it is a very 
important race. 
</P>
<P>
Some time ago I had heard that Jim Roache, one of the candidates for sheriff, 
was opposed to the 15-day waiting period to purchase handguns. 
</P>
<P>
This concerned me greatly. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 29, both candidates were on a radio talk show, so I called in and asked 
specifically about this issue. Roache stated emphatically that he had never 
said he was opposed to a 15-day waiting period and he would not support 
opposition to it. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said he supports the 15-day waiting period and felt it was a 
reasonable amount of time to make the required background investigations. I 
accepted what he said. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine my surprise when, only 2 1/2 weeks later, at a forum in San Diego, 
Roache stated that he was opposed to a 15-day waiting period. He felt it should 
be done more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Now I am very confused. Does he support the 15 days or oppose it? Or is it just 
a matter of what day it is and who he is talking to?

REFLECTIONS: ESTHER HAWK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Esther Hawk went into nursing 43 years ago, her main duties were to 
comfort the patients, put everything back in the exact place she found it, and 
always -- always! -- stand up when a doctor entered the room. It was definitely 
a different world back then, says the 64-year-old Solana Beach resident, who 
recently retired as vice president of patient services at Scripps Memorial 
Hospital-La Jolla. During her 23 years at Scripps, Hawk served as a continuing 
education instructor, responsible for the orientation and continuing education 
of all nursing personnel, and as the hospital's first day-nursing supervisor. 
In 1969, she was named assistant director of nursing, a position she held for 
10 years. Prior to Scripps, Hawk served as a Navy nurse during the Korean War, 
helping to treat wounded servicemen after they were unloaded from hospital 
ships. She is a graduate of the old San Diego County General Hospital school of 
nursing, which is now UC San Diego Medical Center. Times staff writer Caroline 
Lemke interviewed Hawk in her home and Vince Compagnone photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
I really don't know why I became a nurse. When I was a little girl I was torn 
between three ambitions. I used to say, "I'm going to smoke Lucky Strikes, and 
I'm going to be a telephone operator or a nurse." I don't smoke, never have 
smoked, and I've since come to hate telephones, but I can honestly say I'm 
proud to be a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, to become a nurse you went to a county hospital and you went into 
a three-year school. You were there to work. You paid your own way, really. We 
would get up in the morning and work on the wards from 7 to 11, come off and 
have lunch for half an hour, then go to class until 3:30 in the afternoon, then 
go back on the wards until 7 at night. 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty cheap labor. But you have to realize, at that time we were in a 
war. We think we have a nursing shortage now, but believe me, there was a 
nursing shortage then. I don't know how the hospitals would have functioned if 
we didn't have student nurses. 
</P>
<P>
This might sound funny, but simple things we take for granted today -- like 
EKGs -- that was a big deal. A nurse in my day would never do that. What we 
really learned to do were comfort measures. We were trained. The nurses now are 
educated. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have intensive-care units back then. If someone had a heart attack, 
you wondered how they lived. They didn't live. That's the difference between 
then and now. 
</P>
<P>
I joined the Navy in 1949. You hear the saying, "Join the Navy and see the 
world." Well, I joined the Navy and went 15 blocks from my home in Long Beach, 
all the way to the Long Beach Naval Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
When the hospital closed in 1950, I came down to San Diego. From here I went to 
Guam, then up to Japan while it was still under the occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
It was kind of antiquated in Guam. I worked in the military hospital's 
pediatric and sick officer's unit. The hospital was Quonset huts with no air 
conditioning, just a lot of fans. We had a typhoon one New Year's Eve day and 
we had to evacuate the hospital because in a typhoon, the Quonset huts would 
blow over. 
</P>
<P>
The only solid barracks were the Marine barracks, so we transported all our 
patients there. The wind was blowing so hard you had to tie a rope around you 
and hang onto ropes to get from building to building. You could see the palm 
trees bend in half because of the winds. 
</P>
<P>
In Guam, the big hospital ships would dock at 7:30 in the morning with 2,500 to 
3,000 patients, and by 7 o'clock that night, all those patients would have been 
triaged, put to bed and at least fed. Then surgery would start and they would 
go three to four days in a row, 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
I think that my first impression of war -- and this was just the Korean War, 
which was nothing compared to World War II -- was that I had never seen that 
many young people in a hospital and it just made my heart go cold. They were 
all around my age. All you have to do is walk through the halls of any military 
hospital right after a hospital ship has divvyed out to know how useless war 
is. It was terrible, it was a real shock. 
</P>
<P>
The thing I liked least about nursing is that sometimes, no matter how you 
tried and tried, the patient would die. With the youngsters, it's especially 
hard. When that happens, it takes something from you. I don't think any nurse 
gets used to it. I think we all come to some sort of reconciliation that there 
is something bigger and higher than us, but it's still hard.

PRO-GROWTH GROUP PULLS BACK CAMPAIGN FOR INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise announcement greeted with skepticism by political opponents, a 
group backing two building-industry initiatives on next month's San Diego 
ballot revealed that it no longer intends to campaign actively for the growth 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's disclosure by the San Diego 2000 Committee that it will not mount a 
campaign for Propositions D and M was immediately attacked by leaders of a 
competing slow-growth group as a possible strategic gambit intended to obscure 
the development industry's true motives. 
</P>
<P>
"The builders may have realized that this is the best way for them to win," 
said Peter Navarro, chairman of Prevent Los Angelization Now. "Every time an 
issue is linked to them, they attract negative attention. Their optimal 
strategy is to keep their involvement as quiet as possible. My concern is that 
this whole thing is a trick." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gary London, a spokesman for San Diego 2000, disputed Navarro's 
theory, saying that his group's decision simply reflected its inability to wage 
an active campaign, not a change in heart as to the propositions' merits. 
</P>
<P>
"We still urge voters to vote yes, but with economic conditions being what they 
are in the building industry, we realized we couldn't raise enough money to 
wage a vigorous campaign," London said. 
</P>
<P>
Propositions D and M, which will appear on the county and city ballots, 
respectively, would assess developers new fees to help finance the roads, 
libraries, parks and other public facilities needed because of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Less stringent than a growth-management program adopted this week by the San 
Diego City Council, the citywide proposition has been criticized by 
environmentalists as an inadequate method of controlling growth, as well as one 
that would fall far short of raising the funds needed for public facilities 
linked to future growth. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, many builders regard the proposition's proposed fees as an ill-advised 
move that would exacerbate the already severe problems posed by the nationwide 
economic downturn. And, while builders have strong reservations about the 
council's program -- in particular, the so-called "citywide impact fees" it 
establishes to make development "pay its own way" -- many prefer it to the 
ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason behind that preference, explained Building Industry Assn. 
President Julie Dillon, is that the council's program can be easily amended, 
while ballot initiatives can only be altered by future propositions -- a more 
cumbersome, costly and lengthy process. 
</P>
<P>
"If the council makes a mistake, as I think it did (this week), you can go back 
and try to modify that immediately," Dillon said. "You don't have that 
flexibility with an initiative."

MOVING A RUNWAY TO REDUCE NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hooray for Raymond Seymour (Letters, Sept. 23), who suggests that the Orange 
County Airport runway be moved back to put the planes higher up when they cross 
over people's homes. This idea is sensible and not too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that I proposed this years ago, but the supervisors felt that it 
was too late to do anything. The environmental impact report on the airport 
said that the idea was impractical because they would have to move the radar. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the radar issue was a bunch of baloney, since it has become highly 
distorted because of all the nearby high-rise buildings that have been built. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego freeway can very easily be put underground at low cost as no 
tunneling is involved. 
</P>
<P>
Let's look at this issue again.

SAFETY HELMETS CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE, DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a mother who never considered purchasing safety helmets for my children, I 
learned the hard way just how important it is. 
</P>
<P>
After our 7-year-old son rode his bicycle into a parked vehicle this summer, he 
lost consciousness, had amnesia, a hematoma and a 4-inch crack through his 
skull. But he was one of the lucky ones -- he survived. If only we had given 
him a helmet to wear along with the responsibility that goes with riding a 
bicycle, we could have saved him, as well as our family, a lot of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Please consider a helmet to go along with that new bike this Christmas. I wish 
we had.

DON'T CLOSE THE BOOK ON LITERACY CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
* FOR THE GOOD OF ALL, UC IRVINE MUST FIND A WAY TO KEEP ITS VITAL READING 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine should reconsider its decision to shut down its Reading and 
Neurolinguistic Clinic, which will close Dec. 30 unless it is granted a 
reprieve. The clinic identifies and helps correct learning disabilities related 
to problems with reading -- the basic building block for all education. But at 
least, at long last, literacy is getting national attention, in part through 
the efforts of First Lady Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic was established five years ago and since has worked one-on-one with 
about 130 children and adults. Anecdotes abound: the boy who was thought not to 
be educable who, after attending the clinic, enrolled in a college prep 
program; the now-bookish 8-year-old girl whose parents thought she would be 
illiterate, and many more. 
</P>
<P>
But individual success stories are not all UCI had in mind when the clinic was 
established, as it turns out. UCI saw the clinic's mission as conducting 
research in literacy and helping to train would-be teachers and medical 
professionals. It also was thought initially that the clinic would reach out 
into the community to serve thousands of reading-impaired students. After 
review, UCI decided there were other programs that, on balance, were a higher 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
In its first few years, founder and coordinator Ann Kaganoff tackled the job of 
getting the clinic on its feet, including finding a place off-campus, at Rancho 
San Joaquin Intermediate School in Irvine, for it to operate. She also worked 
with others around the state who either operated clinics or wanted to establish 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, Kaganoff, who also is on UCI's teacher education faculty, 
probably should have concentrated more on developing teacher training programs. 
And there should have been more emphasis on researching and writing articles on 
the clinic's findings regarding literacy, to put the clinic more in step with 
the university's primary missions. 
</P>
<P>
Kaganoff says she should have sought more grants. Most of the clinic's $100,000 
budget has come from client fees and fund-raisers. But UCI's contribution -- 
$25,000 a year for Kaganoff's half-time position plus some other expenses -- is 
essential to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
These are tough budgetary times in which UCI, like many institutions, must set 
priorities. Some programs, even important ones, may have to yield to other 
needs. But, now that the clinic has built a foundation, the university should 
try to find a way to keep it. Once it is dismantled, a valuable resource will 
be lost to the community, perhaps forever.

HOMELESS DRIVE FELL SHORT, YET SUCCEEDED; 
</P>
<P>
* COMBINED EFFORT LAID GROUNDWORK FOR COLLABORATIONS SURE TO BE NEEDED IN 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the summer's emergency food and shelter campaign fell far short of its 
goals, it would be tempting to say the effort was a failure. But there were 
many successes, the first of which was the collaboration of many agencies to 
aid the poor and hungry at a time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Some background is needed: While there is always a great need for food and 
shelter, the summer of 1990 was especially harsh for two reasons. First, all 
agencies serving the poor have seen a huge increase in demand since the 
beginning of the year. And, second, one of Orange County's biggest charities, 
Share Our Selves of Costa Mesa, had closed down its food, clothing and 
emergency financial operations while its new home was being refurbished. SOS 
had hoped to be open as early as August, but city permit and other delays have 
pushed that date to at least October. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the situation, the United Way and the Orange County Homeless Issues 
Task Force in June started the unusual summer effort aimed at gathering $1 
million, 500,000 pounds of food and 1,000 new volunteers. The results: 
$213,500, 7,425 pounds of food and 291 volunteers. But the effort had an 
immediate impact: As soon as goods and money were received, they were dispersed 
to agencies to give to those in need. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major contributors were United Way, 502 Fair Share, Parker Hannifin 
and many private donors. Food drives were held by the American Red Cross, the 
Girl Scouts, Crystal Cathedral Preschool, the Church of Religious Science, 
Orange's municipal Social Services Agency and several private businesses. 
McDonnell Douglas donated $10,500 to the Food Distribution Center. Some food 
drives are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
All of the agencies were responding to the crisis that, it was hoped, was only 
temporary. But, things being what they are today, their efforts may be needed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a giveaway of school supplies and clothes conducted Sept. 29 by the 
Orange County Rescue Mission was an indication of how much poverty there really 
is in Orange County. Hundreds of impoverished children and parents stood in 
line for hours to obtain new and used clothes, boxes of pencils, stacks of 
notebooks and bags of books and crayons. The turnout far exceeded expectations 
and supply. 
</P>
<P>
As for the summer's collaboration of agencies, the combined effort laid the 
groundwork for future collaborations. Perhaps that will help avoid similar 
emergencies in the future.

COLUMN ON SHERIFF GATES CAME AS BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Brad Gates verdict: There shouldn't be any fuss about Brad Gates having to 
pay damages out of his own pocket. Those who have supported him all these years 
will take up a collection for him. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, they can sell their guns. 
</P>
<P>
But of a more serious note, perhaps it is time for Sheriff Gates to resign, to 
take the honorable course of action instead of relying upon his well-entrenched 
constituency to promote his "I was just doing what was best for Orange County" 
routine, and vilify the verdict (see Supervisor Roger R. Stanton) as being 
"outrageous." (It always is when it doesn't go their way, isn't it? Such 
complacency!) 
</P>
<P>
You see, the point that must finally be addressed is that Sheriff Gates has 
only done what's right for a selected portion of Orange County, regardless of 
the constitutional dimensions of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Sheriff's Department asked if perhaps the jury wanted the 
department to be more "liberal" in the handling of concealed weapons permits, a 
response that illuminates the attitude of the department, a reflection of its 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The jury only wanted the sheriff to follow the Constitution. Sheriff Gates 
wanted (perhaps finally had to have) his day in court, and a jury unanimously 
found him in violation of the Constitution he took an oath to protect. 
</P>
<P>
The players of this lawsuit are not the issue. The Constitution, which perhaps 
Sheriff Gates and the Board of Supervisors should read, is precisely the point. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff should step down, or the community, if it has even a faint 
heartbeat of the morality of law and order it so vehemently espouses, should 
initiate steps to have him removed from office.

COLUMN ON SHERIFF GATES CAME AS BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dana Parsons' column on Brad Gates ("For Sheriff Who Would Be Sun King, It's 
All Too Shady," Sept. 30) was like a breath of fresh air to my Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
I'm glad to learn that I'm not the only human being in Orange County who 
believes that Gates' lease has run out, that it's time for the people to 
repossess that office he so ungraciously occupies. 
</P>
<P>
As one who recovered damages for Gates' unlawful conduct (in 1987, four others 
and I received $375,000 due to Gates' unwarranted investigations and 
harassments), I know that a settlement or a verdict always brings ambivalent 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
First, one is gratified to be shown to have been right -- right guys do not pay 
wrong guys $375,000 (or any other greater or lesser sum) to settle cases. 
</P>
<P>
However, one then realizes that the money comes from the pockets of the 
taxpayers, whose only error was in electing the likes of Gates, and the victory 
is not as sweet as it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that in the case of the Ritter brothers, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors has been presented a golden opportunity to dispense a little real 
justice. The board can refuse to pay any portion of any punitive-damages 
judgment that is rendered against the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Make Brad pay every dime from that $1.6 million worth of real estate he's 
acquired while sheriff, or borrow it from some of those guys he gave gun 
permits to. After all, it was not the taxpayers who created, nurtured and 
benefited from the "Gates Gun Club." So, why shouldn't Gates pony up the 
damages, handle the downside as well as he has obviously handled the upside? 
</P>
<P>
The board, as ramrod straight as wet spaghetti where the sheriff is concerned, 
will have to be prompted and nudged by the voters on an issue like this, but 
even less courageous politicians have been moved to do even braver things by 
the voice of the people.

TRANSPORTATION EFFORTS SHOW WEAKNESS OF CITIES LEAGUE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letter to the editor from Patricia McGuigan, president of the Orange County 
League of California Cities (Sept. 16), was the first public statement I've 
seen in over a year from this important group; let's hope it's the last for an 
era or so. 
</P>
<P>
In defending her committee's role in the transportation woes of the county, Ms. 
McGuigan has but one paltry offering, an innocuous reference to a monthly 
meeting held to "coordinate transportation projects." 
</P>
<P>
The balance of her letter, couched in the semibureaucratese favored by those 
who have nothing to utter but warm air, is a feeble attempt to justify the 
existence of this obscure and ineffective committee. 
</P>
<P>
I dare say the county would survive the immediate dissolution of this group, 
placing whatever leftover dreams it had where they rightly belong -- on the 
supervisors' desks. 
</P>
<P>
Minor items such as the coordination of traffic lights between cities or a 
realistic study of the effect on neighboring cities when Anaheim and Santa Ana 
finally build their temples to the jockstrap egos of their mayors and other 
elected "public servants" are but two modest suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors should well be able to handle these problems now that the 
airport is built and the lawsuits haven't yet arrived from various aggrieved 
builders and contractors.

I have trouble identifying with a "tainted" sheriff who has a movie star as a

I think it's about time he climbed onto his horse and rode off into the sunset.

However, his friends, mentors, developers etc., will help defray his fines, and 
it will be business as usual. Too bad! The voters deserve who they vote for.

IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CURING THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG A. PANE, Dr. Gregg A. Pane is assistant chief of emergency medicine at 
UCI Medical Center and chairman of the Orange County Emergency Medical Care 
Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite repeated calls for action, the serious deterioration in our health 
system continues unabated. 
</P>
<P>
The California Legislature recently adjourned from an otherwise productive 
session without achieving progress on this issue. The Board of Supervisors was 
forced to slash the Indigent Medical Services budget by an incredible 54%. The 
Medi-Cal network has essentially disintegrated with the decision by Fountain 
Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center to withdraw from the program and 
the appearance that another major hospital is ready to do so. Worst of all, 
there seems to be no major consensus solution on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
This situation has severely restricted access to needed health services for 
millions of Californians. Many people have been forced to seek routine care in 
already overloaded and underfunded emergency departments, the only guaranteed 
access point to our health system. 
</P>
<P>
A study of 1,000 UCI Medical Center emergency patients found that 25% regularly 
use the emergency department for their basic health needs. This phenomenon has 
led to overcrowding, trauma center closures, ambulance diversions and hospitals 
choosing to downgrade or eliminate emergency services. This affects all 
citizens, rich and poor, who may be less able to get timely emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
While the United States spends nearly 12% of its gross national product on 
health care, by far the most of any nation, we rank just 20th in infant 
mortality, and our life expectancy is only average. There are a host of factors 
that explain this apparent paradox. In a study of emergency admissions at UCI, 
we found that patients with restricted access who delayed in seeking care had a 
25% longer and more expensive hospital stay. 
</P>
<P>
Inadequate public discussion of ethics and resource allocation has led to high 
societal and legal expectations of unlimited care as a basic right. This has 
forced physicians to practice defensive medicine by ordering unnecessary tests 
and procedures, costing about $50 billion to 100 billion annually. Because of 
the immense complexity of insurance forms and regulatory oversight mechanisms, 
the United States leads the world in administrative spending, with more than 
20% of total costs. We have made no serious attempts at comprehensive planning, 
public education or prevention of illness. California spends $18 billion each 
year for health and societal costs related to alcohol and tobacco abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the scope and magnitude of the health care crisis, and the plethora of 
reform recommendations from many panels and commissions, the legislative 
solution remains elusive. The reasons include lack of consensus among the major 
players, lack of political will to make difficult decisions and lack of 
political pressure from voters. 
</P>
<P>
Any comprehensive plan must involve the following: 
</P>
<P>
1) Health insurance. Everyone, including the poor and "uninsurable," must have 
some form of insurance providing access to basic services and long-term care. 
This system should be primarily based on employers, with cost tied to personal 
income. Insurance plans must be more standardized and simplified and cannot be 
left solely to market forces. 
</P>
<P>
2) Tort reform. Reasonable standards of care with a clear medical-legal linkage 
must be developed. Removing this problem from the courts and instituting some 
form of binding arbitration would be in the best interests of everyone and 
would save billions yearly in defensive medicine costs. By removing "blame" 
from the system, all patients who are injured or suffer an unavoidable bad 
outcome could be quickly and fairly compensated. 
</P>
<P>
3) Emphasis on prevention/wellness. We need to establish financial incentives 
for wellness, such as tax credits or insurance rebates. Our system often makes 
it difficult to receive screening exams, immunizations and prenatal care, while 
we routinely incur enormous spending in covering intensive care and 
high-technology, in-hospital services. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of the big-fix solution, immediate stabilizing measures are required. 
Late last year, the Orange County Emergency Medical Care Committee unanimously 
passed a cost-effective, seven-point, short-term plan in anticipation of the 
evolving crisis. It calls for using tobacco tax money; supporting mandatory 
motorcycle helmet legislation; supporting stiff penalties for drunk drivers and 
implementing all available cost recovery mechanisms for alcohol-related 
injuries; developing a high-profile education campaign stressing disease 
prevention; supporting a requirement for state-mandated auto insurance to 
include a basic health package; creating a disaster mode in which good-faith 
providers who serve the uninsured could be deputized to limit liability, and 
developing an emergency prioritization list for county Indigent Medical 
Services money. 
</P>
<P>
The November election represents a golden opportunity for voters to authorize 
needed resources. Proposition 134, the nickel-a-drink alcohol tax initiative, 
would raise more than $730 million annually for law enforcement, mental health, 
public education, alcohol treatment centers, emergency and trauma care and 
battered women shelters. A broad coalition supports the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
California has the lowest overall alcohol tax in the nation. The wine tax was 
last raised in 1937, the beer tax in 1959 and the spirits tax in 1967. The 
annual revenue of $129 million from these taxes offsets just 1% of the total 
societal cost of alcohol abuse, with taxpayers subsidizing 99%. As 11% of the 
population consumes 68% of the alcohol, Proposition 134 is an initiative that 
all of us can support. 
</P>
<P>
The view from the front line is not a pretty sight. Our health safety net is 
full of gaping holes large enough for any of us to fall through. Your 
constructive participation in the political process could make the difference 
in saving lives.

PICKING A PLANNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "New Planner Picked After Investigation" (Sept. 21): In The Times' 
continuing quest to prove that half a story is better than none, your reporter 
missed a few critical points in the story about the newest appointee to the 
Planning Commission in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Since I applied for this opening on the commission and since my name was 
mentioned in the article, I would like to clarify my reasons for appearing 
before the City Council on two occasions to question the appointment and the 
process by which it was made. 
</P>
<P>
As the Times reported, I did question whether my qualifications were better 
than Mark Murphy's because I work in the field of land planning; he works in 
marketing. But the council let me know that they were looking for a "fresh 
perspective." (So much for all my education and 10 years' experience in the 
field.) 
</P>
<P>
Another salient point that I did not see mentioned in the article is that Mark 
Murphy is serving as Mayor Pro Tem Gene Beyer's campaign manager in his current 
campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know Mark Murphy, and I wish him no ill will, but an appointment to 
the Planning Commission does not a planner make, and at least one council 
member has told me that he relies heavily upon the commission's recommendations 
to make his own decision. This public appointment should not be based on 
politics.

HURRICANES: TEAM BACK IN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP PICTURE AFTER RUSHING FOR 334

University of Miami center Darren Handy awoke to a gentle knock on his hotel 
room door Saturday morning. Sequestered in a local resort the night before a 
home game, Handy found a Miami Herald on the doorstep. He turned to the sports 
section and there, in black and white, was a position-by-position analysis of 
Miami and Saturday's foe, No. 2-ranked Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Under offensive line . . . advantage FSU. 
</P>
<P>
"We took that personally," said Handy, who still can't believe what he read. "I 
mean, they gave it to Florida State." 
</P>
<P>
The mistake won't be made again. Not after Miami's 31-22 victory over FSU in a 
Sunshine State grudge match that wasn't nearly as close as the score might 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes (3-1), ranked ninth, ran early and often. They ran left. They 
ran right. But mostly they ran over a surprised Seminole defensive line. So 
large were the openings, that Miami quarterback Craig Erickson, all 196 pounds 
of him, even considered a rushing career. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the holes that were opening up, I wanted to fake and run it through," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. Instead, he stuck the ball in the capable hands of fullbacks Stephen 
McGuire and Leonard Conley, tag team extraordinaire. McGuire, who gained 176 
yards and scored once, and Conley, who rushed for 144 yards and two touchdowns, 
recorded career highs for rushing yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line was knocking their defensive line two yards off the ball," 
said McGuire, who was punched in the mouth by FSU cornerback Terrell Buckley on 
his first carry. "That made it kind of easy for me to go through the holes." 
</P>
<P>
All told, Miami gained 334 yards on the ground, enough to control the clock and 
make an FSU comeback nearly impossible. And unlike previous Miami games, 
Erickson wasn't required to win the game by himself. He attempted only 23 
passes, completed 13, none to a Hurricane wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
This was a day when college football heaved and shuddered with the upset of No. 
1 Notre Dame, as well as several other near misses. Before an Orange Bowl 
audience of 80,396, Miami did its part to confuse the pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, the Hurricanes led, 24-6. They scored on four consecutive 
possessions. About the only mistake Miami made during those first two quarters 
was kicker Carlos Huerta's bungled decision after the coin toss. FSU (4-1) won 
the call, but deferred. Huerta, against specific orders of Miami coaches, said 
the Hurricanes would kick the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the goof worked in Miami's favor. The Hurricanes did most of 
their scoring with a stiff ocean breeze at their back. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was a pretty smart move by Carlos," Miami Coach Dennis Erickson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By defeating FSU, Miami denied the Seminoles a clear view atop the rankings. 
FSU has never been No. 1 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes also avenged last year's loss in Tallahassee, to say nothing of 
preventing FSU Coach Bobby Bowden from earning the 200th victory of his career. 
Miami has won five of the last six and eight of the last 11 games against its 
up-state rival. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if Dennis Erickson was savoring the moment, he didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
"Losses last forever, wins last until Monday," he said. "That loss (to FSU a 
year ago) will probably last until I'm dead, which might not be too long." 
</P>
<P>
There's one other benefit of the Hurricanes' victory: Miami squirms back into 
the national championship picture. A loss would have been devastating. No team 
has won a national title with two losses. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is sweet," said Miami offensive tackle Mike Sullivan. "If I had off 
tomorrow, I'd go to Disney World." 
</P>
<P>
At one point during Saturday's game, Handy recalled watching the FSU defensive 
linemen smile after McGuire or Conley would break free for one of their many 
sizeable gains. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was strange," Handy said. "I thought there would be a lot of 
talking, but they were real quiet. They'd smile, so we started saying, 'Yeah, 
we're coming back at you. We'll be back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even with the warning, FSU couldn't stop Miami's ground attack, especially in 
the first and second quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost this game in the first half," Bowden said. "I can't believe the lack 
of poise we showed early. We played so much better in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
FSU did manage to trim the deficit to 24-16 with 11:30 remaining. Running back 
Amp Lee scored on a two-yarder to end a drive made possible by Lawrence 
Dawsey's many receptions. For the afternoon, Dawsey had 13 catches for 160 
yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Miami responded, as it had most of the game, with a long scoring drive of its 
own, this one 14 plays. McGuire did the honors with a two-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
How things change. Only a month ago, the Hurricanes, then ranked No. 1, were 
upset by Brigham Young. Now this. Notre Dame loses to Stanford. Auburn 
struggles. Oklahoma has to work to beat Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
Miami lives. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to BYU and lose and everybody thinks it's the end of the world," Dennis 
Erickson said. "But that's college football. Who knows what's going to happen? 
All I know is that we've got a good football team." 
</P>
<P>
For proof, ask Florida State.

Kansas State is enjoying a resurgence this season, but the Wildcats still 
cannot keep pace with powerful Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Joseph and Leodis Flowers broke open a tight game with third-quarter 
touchdowns and the Cornhusker defense did not yield a touchdown for the third 
time this season as No. 8 Nebraska beat Kansas State, 45-8, in a Big Eight 
Conference game Saturday at Manhattan, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, 5-0 overall and 1-0 in the Big Eight, defeated the Wildcats for the 
22nd consecutive time and put the game away in the fourth quarter on a 45-yard 
touchdown pass play from Mike Grant to Jon Bostick, a 99-yard kickoff return by 
Tyrone Hughes' and a 26-yard scoring run by Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State (3-2, 0-1), already with more points and three times as many 
victories as last season, was behind 10-2 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats handed Nebraska its first quarterback sack and first blocked punt 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas 34, Iowa State 34 -- Iowa State's Jeff Shudak kicked a 53-yard field 
goal with 18 seconds left in a Big Eight game at Ames, Iowa, to give the 
Cyclones the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Shudak's field goal capped a wild fourth quarter in which the lead changed 
hands three times. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (1-3-1, 0-1-1) took a 34-31 lead a six-yard touchdown run by Maurice 
Douglas with 2:51 left, and it appeared the Iowa State's last hopes died when 
defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield batted down Chris Pedersen's fourth-down 
pass with 1:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Iowa State (2-2-1, 1-0) held Kansas on fourth down at the Cyclones' 32 and 
drove to the Jayhawks' 36, setting up Shudak's game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Sands rushed for 169 yards in 22 carries for Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State's Blaise Bryant rushed for 111 yards in 24 carries and scored two 
touchdowns.

GUNDY DOESN'T PASS UP BIG CHANCE;

Freshman quarterback Cale Gundy came off the bench and connected with tight end 
Adrian Cooper on a 52-yard touchdown pass play at the end of the first half 
Saturday as No. 7 Oklahoma beat Oklahoma State, 31-17, in a Big Eight 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown, with no time left in the half, tied the score 14-14 and gave the 
Sooners, 5-0 overall, 2-0 in the Big Eight, an emotional lift. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma defense held the Cowboys (2-3, 0-1) to 66 yards in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy replaced starter Steve Collins on the final series of first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defensive structure was such that we needed to throw the football," 
Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs said. "Some things they took away from us allowed 
Cale to step in and really do a nice job." 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners, faced with fourth and nine at their 48, had started trotting to 
the locker room, but were called back onto the field when Oklahoma State called 
a timeout with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy, whose brother, Mike, played for Oklahoma State and now is an assistant 
coach with the Dallas Cowboys, lofted a pass to the 6-foot 6-inch Cooper, who 
outjumped defenders near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State took a 17-14 lead on a 39-yard field goal by Cary Blanchard less 
than a minute into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma took the lead for good, 21-17, on Gundy's one-yard run in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy completed six of 10 passes for 119 yards.

ILLINOIS MAKES BUCKEYES PAY FOR MISTAKES, 31-20;

In a college football Saturday of upsets, near-upsets and controversial plays, 
Illinois and Ohio State wouldn't be left out of the party. 
</P>
<P>
So, after the Illini, ranked No. 13 with Houston, defeated their 20th-ranked 
Big Ten foe, 31-20, the question was whether a key lateral was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The lateral was a disputed pitch by Illinois' Mike Poloskey after a blocked 
field-goal attempt early in the fourth quarter. The play resulted in Quintin 
Parker's 45-yard touchdown return. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, leading 24-20, blocked a 51-yard field-goal attempt by Tim Williams. 
Poloskey picked it up and lateraled to Parker. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I picked it up," Poloskey said, "I knew I wasn't going to make it to the 
end zone. I heard people calling for the ball and I just pitched it. I wasn't 
really looking for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Television replays appeared to show Poloskey flipped the ball forward three 
yards and Parker caught it in stride to score the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"When Poloskey pitched the ball, momentum made it look like it was pitched 
forward," Parker said. "I thought I was even with him." 
</P>
<P>
When he was told some replays showed the ball as being lateraled forward, 
Illinois Coach John Mackovic said, "Was it really? I think it was a backward 
lateral. He was definitely behind him when he lateraled." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ohio State had only 10 men on the field for the kick. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not see the play," Buckeye Coach John Cooper said. "Someone told me it 
was a forward lateral. I didn't see it from where I was." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (3-1) has beaten Ohio State (2-2) three consecutive times. That hasn't 
happened since 1927-29. 
</P>
<P>
Turnovers were the key to Saturday's victory as Ohio State quarterback Greg 
Frey threw four interceptions and, besides the blocked field goal, the Buckeyes 
lost two fumbles and had the field goal blocked. It was the third straight game 
in which the Buckeyes had a kick blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State led 20-17 after Tim Williams's 37-yard field goal in the third 
quarter, but the Illini came back on a one-yard scoring pass from Jason 
Verduzco to David Olson. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble on Ohio State's first play from scrimmage resulted in a two-yard 
touchdown pass from Verduzco to Jeff Finke. The Buckeyes countered with scoring 
runs of five yards by Robert Smith and one yard by Harris to go ahead, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Griffith, who scored an NCAA-record eight touchdowns in the Illini's 
last game, a 56-21 victory over Southern Illinois, scored on a 12-yard run 
early in the second half to tie the score, 17-17. He finished with 86 yards in 
26 carries.

FULLERTON IS DOING BETTER BUT STILL LOSES TO LAS VEGAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton continued its five-week string of futility, losing to 
Nevada Las Vegas, 29-10, Saturday night before 13,791 in the Silver Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, 1-5 overall and 0-2 in the Big West Conference, committed only one 
turnover Saturday night as opposed to 16 in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton's turnover was crucial, and the Titans made two other mistakes on 
punt plays that helped the Rebels (3-3, 2-1) score a touchdown and a field goal 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 23-10, in the fourth quarter, Fullerton drove from the Rebel 44-yard 
line to the 20, where quarterback Paul Schulte passed over the middle to 
Richard Harrison. Harrison appeared headed for the end zone but ran into a 
teammate, lineman Tim Drevno, and fell at the four. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Schulte fumbled the snap -- the Titan quarterback lost two 
fumbles on snaps inside the Fresno State 12-yard line in last week's 38-3 loss 
-- and Jody Reinoehl recovered for the Rebels with 9:56 to play. Fullerton was 
not able to mount a scoring threat the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Titan punter Phil Nevin attempted a fake but was sacked by 
Raymond Walters at the Rebel 20. Two plays later, Hunkie Cooper scored on an 
18-yard run for a 14-3 Las Vegas lead. 
</P>
<P>
On Fullerton's next possession, Nevin, in punt formation, bobbled a low snap 
and was tackled by Walters at the UNLV 19, resulting in Todd Amrein's 39-yard 
field goal and a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels drove 80 yards in 15 plays, Derek Black scoring on a one-yard run, 
to take a 23-3 lead late in the second quarter, but Fullerton cut it to 23-10 
on Schulte's five-yard touchdown pass to J.J. Celestine with 5:26 left in the 
third quarter.

M.C. HAMMER HAS A BASEBALL BACKGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those unconvinced that the Oakland Athletics are a team that has 
everything, there is the matter of Stanley Burrell. As if it weren't enough 
that the defending world champions boast a starting rotation with two 20-game 
winners, a superb bullpen, twin towers of power, a man on the verge of a record 
for career stolen bases and a spare outfielder who clinched the National League 
batting title while observing an American League game, herewith the Hammer. Or 
M.C. Hammer, as he now bills himself. 
</P>
<P>
To the DH, a position where they are at least three-deep entering the American 
League Championship Series Saturday night against the Boston Red Sox, the A's 
have added the DR, as in designated rapper. Fittingly, Oakland's gift to the 
latest phenomenon in music has sterling credentials. The man's second album, 
"Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em," has surpassed five million in sales. Not only 
does that make it the best-selling album of any kind this year but the 
best-selling rap album of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Spike Lee in his trademark Brooklyn cap and Dodgers shirt, Hammer 
frequently wears his hometown affiliation on his sleeve. But this is not a case 
of a celebrity fan identifying with a time and place, such as Tom Selleck in 
his Detroit Tigers cap. Burrell, aka Hammer, once served as an executive with 
the A's, if in name only. The first stage on which he performed was in 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Burrell, "discovered" by former owner Charles O. Finley while 
dancing for his supper in the parking lot, first assumed his alter ego. Given a 
job in the clubhouse, the youngster soon received a nickname from the players 
who had recently reveled in a third consecutive World Series triumph but would 
win no more in the Finley era. He became the Little Hammer, for his facial 
resemblance to Henry Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
With promotions from Finley and his own gift for self-promotion, Burrell was on 
his way to the top. From batboy to office boy to errand boy and, finally, to 
executive vice president. To appreciate the joke, however, it is necessary to 
understand the condition of the A's franchise at the time. 
</P>
<P>
As the team sank in the standings, the visits by Finley -- an absentee owner 
who continued to run a Chicago-based insurance company -- were less frequent. 
The front-office staff evolved into a skeleton crew, invested with the 
authority to answer the telephone and do little else. The A's idea of 
advertising the product was the distribution of schedules each spring. Its 
broadcasting lineup became an annual guessing game, and one year the radio 
rights were acquired for the asking by the college station at the University of 
California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
In such an atmosphere, Burrell ascended to the owner's box. "He used to sit up 
there during games and call Charlie with the play-by-play," recalled Mickey 
Morabito, whom freshly installed Manager Billy Martin brought to Oakland as 
public relations director and traveling secretary in 1980 in the last year of 
Finley's reign. My first sight of him was in 1978 during a rare visit to what 
was then known as the Mausoleum for its lack of warmth and live bodies. The A's 
were en route to an attendance figure of 526,999. That was one year before they 
bottomed out at 306,763. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular day, the debut performance of top draft choice Mike Morgan 
one week after his high school graduation, Burrell was on duty outside the club 
offices. The Hammer was 16 and semi-conspicuous. On the crown of his 
green-and-gold baseball cap, in large block letters, was his title: "VP." For 
those who might not have gotten the message, he greeted the elevator operator 
in tones worthy of a herald. 
</P>
<P>
"Make way for the vee pee," he commanded. 
</P>
<P>
The operator yawned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have your job," Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have it," the operator replied. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent interview, the Hammer received $7.50 per game during his 
stay in the executive suite, which ended when Finley sold the team at the 
conclusion of the 1980 season. Now he is president of his own record firm and 
surrounded by 15 dancers, a dozen background singers, seven musicians and two 
disc jockeys on a worldwide tour that alighted at Meadowlands Arena last 
Friday. But he wouldn't be on the cover of Rolling Stone, as he was in 
September, wouldn't be a star of stage, vinyl and video if it weren't for the 
A's. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rolling Stone, former Oakland outfielders Dwayne Murphy and Mike 
Davis contributed $20,000 to the establishment of Burrell's label, "Bustin' 
Records." He produced his own entry into the lucrative rap market and drew 
sufficient interest to wangle a multi-album deal with Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he has exchanged the VP for M.C. (Master of Ceremonies), the money is 
rolling in. "Charlie always said to me, 'Hammer, I can't promise that you're 
going to be a professional baseball player, but I can say you'll make a 
positive contribution to your race ...,"' Burrell told Rolling Stone. "And he 
said, 'You're going to be somebody of importance."' 
</P>
<P>
That's one prophecy he has fulfilled. Yet he remains a frequent visitor to the 
Coliseum, where Rickey Henderson -- another Oakland native -- is his main man. 
"He's also stopped by in two cities on the road where he was touring," noted 
Morabito, still the A's travel director. Nowadays, however, the Hammer doesn't 
need to announce his own arrival. The showman's sudden fame precedes him, even 
into a clubhouse of megastars.

LONG BEACH STREAK ITS 3, NEW MEXICO STATE'S 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a while for George Allen to believe that Cal State Long Beach's 31-27 
victory over New Mexico State before 3,926 in Veterans Stadium Saturday had 
given the 49ers a three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"Three in a row, holy Moses," he finally said. "I feel drained because I know 
we could have lost it." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which had not won three consecutive games since 1985, improved to 
3-3 overall and 2-1 in the Big West Conference in Allen's first season. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are playing so hard and they beat a team that is tough to play 
because they have been losing," Allen said. "It makes you think you're not 
playing a good team." 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State made a late bid to end the longest current losing streak in 
Division I when it scored on a nine-yard pass from David Chisum to Richard 
Sanchez with 1:24 to play. But an onside kick attempt failed, sending the 
Aggies (0-5, 0-2) to their 22nd consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have depended mostly on passing, finally showed a balanced 
attack with 216 yards rushing and 212 through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Four Long Beach runners gained more than 40 yards, led by Freddie Leslie, who 
had 74. Quarterback Todd Studer completed only 13 of 30 passes, but two went 
for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We made big plays on offense and defense when we had to have them," said 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest came with 10 minutes left and the 49er lead down to 24-21. 
On fourth and one on the Aggie 24, Leslie ran to the six. Three plays later, 
Rickey Clark scored on a one-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies took their only lead, 7-0, on an 11-yard pass from Chisum to Alvin 
Warren. Long Beach tied the score on a two-yard run by Herman Nash and took a 
14-7 lead on a 27-yard pass from Studer to Jeff Exum. The 49ers led, 17-14, at 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-yard TD pass from Studer to Sean Foster extended the lead to 24-14. But 
then Jimmie Mitchell, who gained 120 yards, scored on a three-yard run that was 
set up when Chisum, who was sacked seven times, hit Warren on a 46- yard pass 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great tribute to our players," Allen said of the winning streak. "A 
lesser team would have said the season's over."

IT'S ANOTHER WILD LOSS FOR MCGWIRE, 52-51; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO STATE: QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 415 YARDS AND FIVE TOUCHDOWNS, BUT 
TWO-POINT CONVERSION FAILS AND WYOMING WINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LARAMIE, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in three weeks, San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire got 
hooked up in a passing and scoring battle with an opposing quarterback, only 
this time, the other quarterback's name wasn't Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
It was Tom Corontzos, a relatively obscure quarterback from the University of 
Wyoming. But it didn't matter. The Aztec defense couldn't cover its own shadow 
Saturday, and Wyoming (6-0, 3-0) ended up with a wild, 52-51 Western Athletic 
Conference victory before 16,713 in War Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (2-3, 1-2) had a chance to win with 2:10 to play. That's when they 
scored the last of their six touchdowns, pulling to within a point at 52-51, 
and Coach Al Luginbill decided to go for a two-point conversion. McGwire faded 
back to pass and Wyoming defensive end Mitch Donahue bore down on him. Receiver 
Jimmy Raye broke for the right side of the end zone, but linebacker Pete Gosar 
was able to stay in front of him and McGwire's pass went over Raye's head. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs tried an onside kick, but Wyoming recovered and almost ran out the 
clock. The Cowboys punted on the last play of the game, but there was no 
return. 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined for 13 touchdowns and four field goals. Wyoming had 648 
yards total offense; the Aztecs had 615. The 103 combined points is the most 
scored in a game in Laramie. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he had no reservations about going for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to come all the way up here to play a tie," Luginbill said. 
"That's insane. How could I look those kids in the eye? Those kids played their 
tails off." 
</P>
<P>
By the time it was finished, the Aztecs were stunned into making such 
statements as the following, from McGwire: 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't put enough points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire was impressive, completing 27 of 42 passes for a season-high 415 yards 
and a career-high five touchdowns. He didn't throw an interception. And 51 
points generally is not considered a lacking offense. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, McGwire passed for 362 yards and three touchdowns against BYU, 
but the Aztecs were defeated, 62-34. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he just didn't complete the final two-point conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming had an easy time against the Aztec defense, averaging 10 yards per 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Two of its touchdown drives -- one that went 80 yards and another that went 48 
-- took one play. 
</P>
<P>
Corontzos completed 20 of 32 passes for 421 yards and three touchdowns. The 421 
yards were a career-high for Corontzos and ranked as the second-best passing 
day in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Corontzos isn't known as a dominating passer, but the Aztecs sometimes have a 
way of making opposing quarterbacks into stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were not blown coverages," Luginbill said. "Let's get that straight. We 
did not make the plays. We had people there, and they either got beat or they 
didn't make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec wide receiver Patrick Rowe caught 10 passes for 174 yards and a 
touchdown. Aztec receiver Dennis Arey caught eight for 171 yards and three 
touchdowns. It was Arey's fourth consecutive game of more than 100 yards 
receiving, becoming only the third receiver in school history to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Wiggins caught eight of Corontzos' passes for 166 yards and one 
touchdown. Robert Rivers had 117 yards on four receptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs built a 27-14 lead in the third quarter but blew a chance to take 
command when their defense, on third and 13 from the Wyoming 17, watched 
Corontzos and Wiggins hook up on a 30-yard pass play. Wiggins was 
double-covered by Robert Griffith and Johnny Walker but neither of them turned 
to look for the ball and Wiggins was able to make the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Corontzos passed 25 yards to Wiggins for a touchdown, 
bringing Wyoming to within six, 27-21. From that point, the race was on.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP;

TCU SCORES QUICKLY, BEATS ARKANSAS, 54-26 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Christian struck quickly and effectively against two-time defending 
Southwest Conference champion Arkansas Saturday night at Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Clay completed six of his first seven passes for 214 yards and three 
touchdowns as TCU coasted past the No. 21 Razorbacks, 54-26, the most points 
ever scored by the Horned Frogs in a conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was TCU's first over Arkansas since 1984 and only the third in the 
last 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Christian is 4-1 overall -- its best start since 1984 -- and 2-0 in the 
Southwest Conference for the first time since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is 2-2 and 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Clay completed 19 of 28 passes for 322 yards. He had touchdown pass plays of 88 
yards to Kyle McPherson and 57 yards to Richard Woodley in the first 93 seconds 
of the second quarter as TCU built a 28-10 lead with just 13 offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Houston 31, Baylor 15 -- Dave Klingler threw 68 passes, completing 35 
for 405 yards, as the Cougars (4-0, 3-0) beat the Bears (2-3, 1-1) in an SWC 
game at Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler's 68 attempts is one short of the school and conference record set by 
former Houston quarterback Andre Ware. 
</P>
<P>
The 35 completions was the most ever against a Baylor team. And it was 
Klingler's fourth consecutive game over 400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Klingler's passes went to Patrick Cooper for touchdowns as the nation's 
No. 2 offensive team piled up 467 yards against Baylor's prevent defense. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler completed 21 of 41 passes for 269 yards in the first half as the 
Cougars built a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Texas A&amp;M 28, Texas Tech 24 -- Backup quarterback Bucky Richardson 
scored the winning touchdown from a yard out after directing a long 
fourth-quarter drive and Darren Lewis rushed for a career-high 232 yards in 34 
carries as the 19th-ranked Aggies (4-1, 1-0) beat the Red Raiders (1-4, 0-2) in 
an SWC game at College Station. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' 232 rushing yards was the most yards ever given up by Tech to an SWC 
runner. On the SWC all-time list, Lewis is now tied for second with former Tech 
running back James Gray for number of games with over 200 yards rushing (four) 
and former Texas running back Earl Campbell for number of 100-yard games (21). 
</P>
<P>
Richardson came in after starting quarterback Lance Pavlas had an interception 
returned 67 yards early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Blackshear of Texas Tech returned a kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown. It 
was the first kickoff return for a touchdown against Texas A&amp;M's 12th Man 
-- a group of non-scholarship students -- since its inception in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 26, Rice 10 -- Michael Pollak, the nation's leading kicker, had field 
goals of 41, 37 and 27 yards in the first half and a 31-yarder in the fourth 
quarter at Houston as the Longhorns (2-1, 1-0) beat the Owls (2-3, 0-2) for the 
25th consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Texas' domination of the Owls is the longest streak in the SWC. 
</P>
<P>
Pollak, a fifth-year senior who had never attempted a college field goal until 
this season, has kicked three in each of Texas' games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Walker had a one-yard touchdown run and Patrick Wilson scored on a 
four-yard run for the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
North Texas 14, SMU 7 -- Quarterback Scott Davis rushed for 203 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Eagles (3-2) over the Mustangs (1-3) in a nonconference 
game at Denton, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scored the game-winning touchdown on a four-yard run with 1:24 left in 
the third quarter.

<P>
Colorado State's balanced, ball-control offense paid dividends again Saturday 
as the Rams remained unbeaten in the Western Athletic Conference with a 22-13 
victory over Utah at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Copeland rushed for 99 yards and Tony Alford added 82 for Colorado State, 
4-2 overall and 3-0 in the WAC. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams sacked Utah quarterback Jason Woods seven times, intercepted three of 
his passes and recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Utah (2-4, 0-3) continued to experience offensive problems. The Utes' only 
consistently productive weapon was a pass to the tight end, one of which 
resulted in a 72-yard touchdown play from Woods to Mike Anglesey early in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force 24, Navy 7 -- The victory at Air Force Academy, Colo., gives the 
Falcons the edge in the race for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, awarded 
annually to the service academy team with the best record in round-robin play 
with the other academies. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wood kicked field goals of 34 and 32 yards in the second quarter to help 
the Falcons (3-3) to a 13-0 halftime lead. He then hit a 47-yarder in the 
fourth quarter clinch the victory over Navy (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons scored the first time they touched the ball on offense. Fullback 
Chris Howard dived over from the one-yard line after Mike Rodgers blocked 
Jefferson Triplett's punt and Joe Stattmiller recovered at the one. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico 48, UTEP 28 -- The Lobos (2-4, 1-0) snapped a four-game losing 
streak as Jeremy Leach completed 21 of 32 passes for 284 yards and three 
touchdowns. Also, the Lobos' usually dormant running game accounted for a 
season-high 282 yards against Texas El Paso (2-4, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Givens led the Lobo ground attack with 124 yards.

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE CZECHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1981, Jan Ludvig crawled on his belly under the Iron Curtain and across the 
international frontier to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, while authorities slept, Peter Stastny and his younger brother, 
Anton, used the guise of a national team tour to bolt communism with the same 
speed they would later use to bolt through the Hartford Whalers defense. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Vaclav Nedomansky started it all by defecting from Czechoslovakia to 
play in the World Hockey Association and, three years later, with the Detroit 
Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 12 years, defections continued. From Petr Klima to Petr Svoboda to 
Michal Pivonka to Bobby Holik's brother-in-law, Frantisek Musil, they came 
without enough vowels in their names and, usually, with loads of talent. 
</P>
<P>
It was the difficult cultural and on-ice adjustments that buried some of them. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, in a Slavic-merged country of 10 million Czechs and five million 
Slovaks, the communist regime singularly devised a mental hell for the friends 
and family of those who fled. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Wall crumbled in Berlin last year and a democratic government was 
forged in Prague with a flashy, dissident writer, Valcav Havel, drafted as 
president, the door to the NHL swung open for Czechs of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the great forward line of future national teams -- mercurial Robert 
Reichel, strapping Bobby Holik and multidimensional Jaromir Jagr -- plays in 
Calgary, Hartford and Pittsburgh, this season. 
</P>
<P>
NHL franchises draft teen-age Czechs in the first round these days and get them 
immediately -- something unthinkable even three years ago. No more 10th-round 
picks accompanied by prayers and spy-novel intrigue in hopes of a mysterious, 
miraculous defection. Czechs are pouring in: Last season, there were 13 in the 
NHL, the same as in 1982. No fewer than 21 new ones, in 17 cities, are trying 
out at NHL camps. Along with Holik, a Czech from Jihlava, comes balding Slovak 
offensive-defenseman Jergus Baca to Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Not since a lend-lease program in the early 1980s brought the likes of Jiri 
Bubla to Vancouver and Miroslav Dvorak to Philadelphia have Czechs been cleared 
to play. But with NHL president John Ziegler still trying to negotiate an 
appropriate compensation agreement with the Czech federation, teams -- as in 
the case with Baca -- are left to negotiate a player's release form when there 
is a dispute over an existing contract. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Whalers threw three Get-To-Know-Bobby news conferences, they 
obviously have good reason to shy away from attaching any "savior" tags to 
Holik. No Czech has ever been selected as a first- or second-team All-Star. 
None have scored 50 goals in a season. Only Stastny, the all-time leading 
scorer against the Whalers, has scored 100 points in a season -- he has done it 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Whalers also have reason for grand optimism. Stastny and Jaroslav 
Holik, Bobby's father, are Bobby's two big heroes. And Stastny, Jaro and Bobby 
are of the same ilk: big, strong, character centers. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodlines, the desire and a lifelong commitment from his father are in 
place to buttress Bobby's career. His body and demeanor should be suited well 
to the NHL's grinding style. 
</P>
<P>
As Stastny, 34, one of only 26 players to score 1,000 NHL points, lays on the 
massage table in the New Jersey dressing room, he smiles broadly when images of 
Czechoslovakian kids infiltrating the NHL flash through his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, so young," Stastny said. "They don't know what we went through. Later on, 
they will. Their knowledge of what happened will come. And they will 
appreciate. But that is all OK. I have enjoyed personal freedoms for 10 years. 
I am very happy the young guys don't have to go through it." 
</P>
<P>
"I was told by some there that I helped break the system by showing my 
disapproval. But there were guys who went ahead of me that I have so much 
respect for. I'm not the godfather, just part of the process." 
</P>
<P>
It, as Stastny describes the situation, was a devious, systematic revenge by 
Communist authorities. When a player defected, this left others vulnerable to 
the whims of an unforgiving regime. Maybe a brother would suddenly lose a job. 
Maybe a father would be demoted. Maybe a sister would lose admission to the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"Their strategy was that if you did leave they'd get to your family or 
friends," Stastny said. "This is definitely the worst thing you must go 
through. Everywhere in that society there was the factor of fear. You were 
always worried about something. That's the way the system was fed. They 
tortured minds, which can hurt as much as torturing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it never ends, even after communism fell. Always my decision and the 
results will remain on my shoulders. We tried to think about our future and 
have compensated those people we hurt as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Stastny, the proud Slovak from Bratislava, returned to his hometown on the 
Danube for the first time since 1980 during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very memorable," Stastny said. "We left, freshly married, as two. 
We came back as six. We've seen our parents in different countries, like 
Hungary. But it was so nice to see them at home, to show our own children. And 
also to see cousins and in-laws we hadn't seen." 
</P>
<P>
Even as Stastny was enjoying his homecoming, Holik was preparing for his 
departure. He had been to the United States before and had traveled throughout 
Europe with national teams, but this was different. He was striking out on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
On July 15, Holik, who had only recently ended his army duty a year early with 
the help of tennis player Ivan Lendl, arose from bed at his parents' home. He 
ate breakfast. And then, mother, father and Bobby piled into the car for a 
two-hour ride to the Prague airport. His parents waited until Bobby climbed 
aboard a Lufthansa jet to Frankfurt with a changeover flight bound for Boston. 
There, a white limo -- compliments of Whalers advisory board member Bobby Orr 
-- was waiting to whisk him to owner Richard Gordon's summer home in Newport, 
R.I. 
</P>
<P>
If this -- except for the limo part -- sounds more like a kid going to college 
than Stastny's story of mental torture, you are beginning to see why those 
folks were dancing, prancing and partying atop the Berlin Wall last year. 
Freedom was doing one of those Denis Savard spin-o-ramas. 
</P>
<P>
"I have thought about it, and how those who defected had been in great danger," 
Holik said. "At the airport it was emotional for my mom, but very much for my 
dad, too. He did everything so I could play here. I want to play good for him. 
That will give me satisfaction. He said he gave most of his life's power to my 
sister Andrea and to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Communists evidently weren't too big on honoring sports stars gone awry. 
Stan Mikita was born in Sokolce, Slovakia, in 1940. Although he grew up in 
Canada, his 1,467 NHL points are the most by a European-born player and fifth 
all-time. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget about visiting Mikita's hometown," Stastny said. "They built a dam. 
It's underwater." 
</P>
<P>
"Ivan Lendl's dad was head of the Czech tennis federation," Holik said. "When 
Ivan left -- he didn't defect -- his dad was fired. Now he's head again. They 
told him six years ago he's too old. Now, he's younger. It's very weird." 
</P>
<P>
When Andrea, a tennis professional, defected, Jaroslav Holik was dropped from 
head coach to assistant for Dukla Jihlava. When communism ended, Jaroslav was 
rehired as head coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jaro Holik had been a big, strong center. Brother Jiri was a dynamic skater on 
his left wing. 
</P>
<P>
"My uncle was the greatest Czech skater, maybe in all Europe, at one time," 
Holik said. "My dad wasn't a great skater, but he was so strong. He claims he 
never lost a faceoff." 
</P>
<P>
Stastny remembers Jiri, while they were on the national team together, talking 
about Jaro: "He said how tough he is in raising his son. They said he already 
was monster size at 6. I heard they fed him raw meat." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the fall of communism, Holik's father had him tutored in English in 
preparation for the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be terrible now here if I couldn't speak English," Bobby Holik said. 
"I wouldn't want to be in the same position as Jergus." 
</P>
<P>
"I admire (Holik's) dad, a special breed. He paid a price on and off the ice," 
Stastny said. "Under that system you could not revolt without paying the 
consequences. He had an emotional, aggressive style and played like that until 
he was 37. He's the kind of player they look for in the NHL. The son should be 
like the father." 
</P>
<P>
Jaro Holik scored the game-winning goal in a 3-2 victory over the Soviet Union 
to clinch the world title in 1972. Obviously, the goal is a source of great 
pride in the Holik house. 
</P>
<P>
"But the best is still 1969 when the Czechs beat Russians," Bobby Holik said. 
It was revenge for them invading our country in '68. There were people beating 
down the doors at the Aeroflot office in Prague. People went crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"The TV announcer was fired by the communists because he was so happy about the 
victory. I only found out about that six months ago. It was a secret." 
</P>
<P>
When Stastny heard about Holik's story, he replied, "Ah, there will be so many 
things he will learn." 
</P>
<P>
Because they were established international stars, there was more fanfare in 
the NHL surrounding the Soviets last autumn. While some, notably Sergei 
Makarov, played well, the Soviets generally were a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are the Czechs entering a foreign environment this year, but many also 
are kids. 
</P>
<P>
Baca and Chicago's Dominik Hasek -- considered the best goalie in Europe -- are 
25. Vancouver's Richard Kron is 23 and Chicago defenseman Frantisek Kucera is 
22. But Jagr and Vancouver center Petr Nedved (who defected as a junior player) 
are 18. Holik, Vancouver's Jiri Slegr (Bubla's son, who changed his name 
because Bubla is in jail for drug smuggling) and Reichel are 19. Zdeno Ciger, 
Stastny's teammate, is 20. 
</P>
<P>
Holik, already a hulking, 6 foot 4, 210 pounds, finished first on the team in a 
training-camp test to determine aerobic endurance. 
</P>
<P>
"The magic word here is 'young,"' Whalers general manager Ed Johnston said. 
"You're talking 19, not 28. Holik's biggest assets right now is he's a North 
American-style player. That's bred in with his dad. And the fact he speaks 
English. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Stastny was in a different situation than these kids. He defected. And 
he already was high-profile international player. The Stastnys had to play 
hard. What else could they do? They couldn't go back." 
</P>
<P>
"Peter played like a North American -- so does Holik," Whalers coach Rick Ley 
said. "Peter's brother, Anton, played like a European. And he didn't last as 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Stastny believes age will be the young Czechoslovakians biggest ally. 
</P>
<P>
"The younger they are the easier they adapt," Stastny said. "Three things here 
are the keys: the long schedule; the different style of play; and the level of 
physical and mental pressure. This is the best league in the world by far. It 
takes some character to endure. Being willing to pay the price is the 
determining factor ... I will be watching these young players."

RIAL GIVES HIS TRAINER NEEDED LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is life after Stalwart Charger for Pico Perdomo. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the trainer's pride and joy chipped his right knee in the Super 
Derby, sending Stalwart Charger to the sidelines for at least six months, Rial 
came through with a 27-1 surprise in the $500,000 Oak Tree Invitational 
Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old son of Family Crest, Rial had just rejoined Perdomo's barn. He had 
been with the trainer when he arrived in the United States from Argentina late 
last year, but Vince Clyne took over and saddled him when he won Del Mar's 
Escondido Handicap at 29-1 on Aug. 11. Owner Enrique Carlos Boelcke and Clyne 
had a falling out, so Rial came back to Perdomo. 
</P>
<P>
Given a perfect, ground-saving trip by Rafael Meza, Rial took the lead into the 
stretch and outfinished 6-1 shot Eradicate to win by a bit more than a length 
in 2:23 4/5 for the 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Saratoga Passage, who had to be vanned off the track, finished third, 3 1/2 
lengths behind Eradicate, and he was a neck better than Live The Dream, the 5-2 
second choice. Saratoga Passage, who also finished third in the 1989 
Invitational, reportedly bowed a tendon in his left foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
Although the field wasn't among the finest in the race's 22-year history, 
nobody could say Rial didn't earn his victory. He carried 126 pounds, 14 more 
than he did in his Escondido upset and 13 more than he had when finishing 
second in the Louisiana Downs Handicap two weeks earlier, and he ran the last 
quarter mile in a swift 23 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second Grade I upset for Meza in the last couple of months. In 
August, he took Fly Till Dawn wire-to-wire in the Eddie Read at Del Mar, 
shocking Classic Fame and Golden Pheasant. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday was better still for the rider. "This has got to be my biggest win, 
$500,000," he said. "I won the Eddie Read and the Metropolitan Mile a few years 
ago with Garthorn (both $250,000 events). I was second in the ($1-million) 
Santa Anita Handicap with Herat (in 1986). 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've ridden this horse. I was scheduled to ride him in 
Louisiana, but I had surgery to have two pins removed from my right hand. The 
owner told me he'd like the distance and could lay close. He was a little rank 
in the first part, but he settled down well after we crossed the dirt. I had a 
lot of horse. The hole opened up just when I wanted it to." 
</P>
<P>
Never shy about singing the praises of Stalwart Charger, Perdomo was rather 
reserved after Rial's $300,000 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned about him having only two weeks between races," he said. "The 
horse lost weight going back and forth and because of the heat in Louisiana, 
but I thought he had a chance in the race. I thought he could get a piece of 
the cake. 
</P>
<P>
"The further he goes, the better he does. I think the horse is getting better 
with racing and as he's becoming more acclimated to this country. This horse is 
very special to the owner because he bred the horse, too. He saw him being 
born. It's like your kid growing up and playing in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Making his first U.S. start, Eradicate had no excuses, but was well clear of 
the rest of the field.Wajd, the 2-1 favorite, was never a factor. The 
3-year-old Northern Dancer filly, who had finished a close fourth behind 
Salsabil at Longchamps Sept. 16, finished seventh after trailing for the first 
six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be that far back, but she walked out of the gate and I didn't 
want to rush her," said Chris McCarron. "I moved up along the rail down the 
backside, but when I finally had the room, I didn't have any horse."

AMERICA'S HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM NEEDS FIXING, BUT APING CANADA WILL MAKE THINGS 
WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leslie Berkman's story, "U.S. Hospitals Open Doors to Canada's Addicts" (Sept. 
23), serves as a preview to all who would like to see our country adopt a 
similar system of socialized medicine. Except that, unlike the present-day 
Canadians, we shall have nowhere else to go! 
</P>
<P>
Berkman should point out that the three- to four-month wait is not confined to 
drug addiction treatment. Canadians needing a coronary bypass, and likely other 
life-saving procedures, face a similar fate. Many, in fact, vote with their 
feet by flocking across the border for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Our health-care delivery system is by no means perfect. We do need some sort of 
coverage that provides basic health care for all. This might be financed partly 
by employees and partly by employers. We should also force businesses dealing 
with products that constitute significant health hazards to bear the 
consequences for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Why shouldn't we levy a health tax on tobacco, alcohol and polluters to help 
pay for some of the health problems they have created? 
</P>
<P>
While the federal government's tilt toward a health maintenance organization 
type of system is ill-advised, some sort of controls on escalating costs should 
be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage for extraordinary medical procedures, for example, may require a large 
deductible and extra premiums by employees. The revised schedule for medical 
reimbursement by Medicare may be a step in the right direction but will require 
careful evaluation before it is universally applied.

SWEETHEART, GET ME JERRY WEINTRAUB'S AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am grateful to Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Terry Semel 
for helping to redefine the criterion by which one gets a good executive 
position in the entertainment industry, "Jerry Weintraub Quits His Firm, Joins 
Warner" (Sept. 25). 
</P>
<P>
I hope it's not too late for those of us who are crying all the way to the 
poorhouse to learn a lesson from Mr. Weintraub. (Weintraub Entertainment, about 
$175 million in debt, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.) 
</P>
<P>
If we could just arrange to lose $175 million of other people's money, we would 
become eminently employable. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if this is the same system that worked so well in the deregulated 
banking industry. What was it again? Putting a fox in the henhouse? 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for a hilarious read.

BANKING BRIGHT SPOT: CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Banks at the Barricades" (Sept. 23) astutely reveals a disturbing picture of 
the declining competitive position of the U.S. banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
There is a segment of the commercial banking industry that has a very bright 
future: the smaller "independent" banks. 
</P>
<P>
There are 480 commercial banks in California, with combined assets of $324 
billion. Almost 80% of these assets are owned by the state's 10 largest banks, 
each with average assets of $25 billion. The remaining 470 banks each manage 
average assets of $160 million. It is this larger group of smaller banks that 
are referred to as independent banks. 
</P>
<P>
California's independent banks have a bright future for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* Community-based independent banks are better equipped than the branch systems 
of major banks to provide high-quality customer service to a market consisting 
of small businesses, professionals and upscale individuals. 
</P>
<P>
* Through widespread profit-driven centralization of lending staffs and the 
continuing consolidation of branch facilities and the automation of day-to-day 
services, the major banking institutions are enhancing their overall 
profitability. However, in doing so, they are harming their ability to compete 
with independent banks for banking relationships with, again, small businesses, 
professionals and upscale individuals. 
</P>
<P>
* In this environment, California's independent banks are thriving. In 1989, 
the primary capital of all California banks as a percentage of total assets was 
8.15%; this compares to an average primary capital ratio of 7.54% for 
California's 10 largest banks, and 7.93% for all U.S. commercial banks.

Romance and politics never go out of style. The Whittier-La Mirada Light Opera 
Assn. returns for its 39th season with the Andrew Lloyd Weber musical "Evita," 
which opened Friday at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The rags-to-riches story of Eva Peron, the mistress and wife of Juan Peron, 
dictator of Argentina in the 1950s, has won six Drama Desk Awards, the New York 
Critics Circle Award and seven Tony awards, including best musical. Weber and 
lyricist Tim Rice collaborated on the powerful musical score that is best known 
for the song "Don't Cry for Me Argentina." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Michelson will recreate her title role performance from several years ago 
at the Grand Dinner Theatre. David Aldrete continues his portrayal of Juan 
Peron and Danny Bolero will repeat the role of Che as he did for the Downey 
Civic Light Opera. Julie Seaborn will play the mistress and Jamie Anderson will 
play Magaldi. Jim Whitson, veteran performer of the Broadway performance of 
"Evita," will direct this production and Susan Errickson, veteran of four 
"Evita" productions, will choreograph. Leo Kreter will conduct the 21-piece 
live orchestra under the musical direction of Jan Ritschel. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier-La Mirada Civic Light Opera will continue its 39th season with 
productions of "Amahl and the Night Visitors" in December, "Me and My Girl" in 
March and "The Sound of Music" in July. For audition information on upcoming 
productions, call 943-1698. 
</P>
<P>
"Evita" will be performed at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, 
14900 La Mirada Blvd., La Mirada. Show times are 8 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and 
Saturdays and 2:30 p.m. matinees today, Oct. 14 and 20. Performances end Oct. 
20. Tickets are $18 and $16 for Friday and Saturday evening shows, and $17 and 
$15 for Thursday evenings and matinees. Student and senior citizen seats are 
available for all performances one hour prior to show time at half price with 
ID, based on seating availability. Season tickets can still be purchased 
through Oct. 20. For more information, call 944-9801 or (714) 994-6310. MIKE

CHURCH: THE SCHOOL IS DENIED A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT AT ITS NEW LOCATION AFTER 
COMPLAINTS BY RESIDENTS.

Four months ago, students at Leffingwell Christian School left Norwalk and 
moved to a church in Paramount because the school's lease expired. Tuesday 
night, the Paramount City Council told them they will have to move again. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted, 4-1, to deny the junior and senior high school a conditional 
use permit needed for a private school to operate in a neighborhood of mostly 
single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The permit was denied and the school was ordered to move out because neighbors 
complained about congestion and the potential for gang and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
The private, nondenominational school began classes in June at the First 
Assembly of God Church on Orizaba Avenue and Monroe Street. Residents had no 
problems when the school was just 50 students during the summer, Mayor Manuel 
Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
After school opened in September and the enrollment grew to 200, the traffic 
increased. Residents said they also saw more people in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen said the city confronted a similar issue a few years ago, when the 
Emmanuel Reformed Church applied to open a preschool and junior high school in 
the neighborhood. After discussing the issue with residents, the city allowed 
only a preschool, with a maximum of 76 students. 
</P>
<P>
Officials then told the neighborhood that no more private schools would be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Now neighbors were faced with a "new school within 150 yards of Emmanuel 
Reformed," Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors were also apprehensive about the possibility of gang problems and 
drugs, he said. But school officials said neither was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Students were unhappy with the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Reddick, 15, of Norwalk, was upset with the arguments raised against 
the school. "The decision was very unjust," she said. "We had to move from the 
area where we were before. We're not a rowdy bunch of students." 
</P>
<P>
Kristal Poore, 15, of Norwalk, worried about what will happen to her and her 
friends. "If we leave the school," she asked, "where are we going to go? There 
are not many people who are going to go to public school. This is our family." 
</P>
<P>
She added that Leffingwell, with tuition of $250 a month, is an inexpensive 
private school. 
</P>
<P>
School officials were determined to continue their fight. Principal John Clark 
said of the council's decision: "Looks like we're going to have to close up. We 
don't have any place to go. We're considering taking legal action. " 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dobson, a pastor with the Assembly of God congregation, said his church is 
also looking into getting a rehearing before the council. He said there was not 
enough discussion at the Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Allen Parker agreed and said he cast the only dissenting vote 
because he did not have enough information. "I am really appalled," he said. 
"Not by the decision. . . . I was appalled by the lack of information the 
council was interested in getting and the misinformation they had." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Dobson said he was told by the city Planning Department that a 
permit would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
But there was an apparent misunderstanding between the planner and Dobson, 
Deputy City Manager Patrick West said. The planner thought Dobson intended to 
expand an existing school. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council reversed an earlier decision by the Planning Commission 
approving the permit for the school.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
School move -- A story Sunday in the Long Beach section of The Times 
erroneously quoted Paramount Vice Mayor Allen Parker as saying he was "appalled 
by the lack of information the (city) council was interested in getting and the 
misinformation they had." The comment was made by Ken Dobson, a pastor with the 
First Assembly of God, who said church officials may ask the council to 
reconsider its decision ordering the Leffingwell Christian School to move out 
of the church.

UNIVERSITY REACHES OUT WITH VIDEO; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: COMPTON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET TO PARTICIPATE IN -- NOT JUST WATCH 
-- CLASSES AT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills chemistry professor Oliver Seely was burning wood in 
a test tube recently to show how chemical reactions occur. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment was relatively simple, but school officials point to its wider 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
Seely and his class at the university's California Academy of Mathematics and 
Science -- a specialty high school established this semester with 120 
ninth-graders from six area school districts -- had a participating TV 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Dominguez High School in Compton were tuned in as part of a 
program that allows teachers and students at both schools to see and hear each 
other via a two-way television hookup. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only thing they can't do is smell the wood burning," Seely said of 
the Compton high school students. 
</P>
<P>
The audio-video link -- a cooperative effort among the university, the Compton 
Unified School District and Pacific Bell -- gives the Compton students a 
sampling of what college instruction is like, helps improve their academic 
achievement and offers them courses not available on their own campus. 
</P>
<P>
Classes are broadcast from a studio-classroom on the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
campus. A second television camera and a microphone at Dominguez High School 
allow students there to interact with the instructor and class at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell gave the college a $148,000 grant to purchase equipment and 
administer the two-year program, the second of its kind in the state. The other 
has linked Cal State Bakersfield with the mountain community of Tehachapi since 
November, 1989, phone company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakersfield link "bridged a geographical barrier of 40 miles," said Bob 
Lee, Pacific Bell executive vice president for marketing. "Here, it's not so 
much the physical distance but the psychological barriers" the Compton students 
may face concerning the difficulty of college classes or what college is like. 
</P>
<P>
University classes being broadcast to Dominguez High include one-day-a-week 
courses in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, physics and algebra, and a 
five-day-a-week German course. Plans are to offer other five-day courses in 
mathematics and science. Time is also allotted for guest speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Access to university professors allows Dominguez High School to fill staffing 
needs unmet by the Compton school district, said Laura Brown, technology 
coordinator with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we did not have instructors to teach German," Brown said. "The 
university did, and now our students are able to take a German course." 
</P>
<P>
Academy freshman Staci Davis, 14, said the hookup allows her small German class 
to carry on a conversation in German with Dominguez High students "as easily as 
doing it in our small group." 
</P>
<P>
When the program started three weeks ago in Compton, academy student Jose 
Arredondo, 14, was surprised when he "looked up into the screen and there was 
my brother," Juan, 16, a junior at Dominguez High. 
</P>
<P>
Students and instructors praised the system's ability to let them interact. It 
"allows students (at Dominguez High) to participate in the class and not just 
view it as they would with one-way video," said Warren Ashley, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills' director of distance learning. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the classes broadcast to Compton will be those offered at the academy, 
which is expected to become a full-fledged high school. Ashley said the 
telecommunications link will someday allow other schools to use the academy as 
a resource. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense," he said, "the university becomes a broker" of enriched teaching 
by creating "an electronic forum" for education. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley said the program gives the university a way to recruit potential 
students, stimulate development of innovative and non-traditional teaching 
strategies and promote better relations with the community. 
</P>
<P>
Compton school officials hope to expand the system to the district's two other 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fascinated by the program here," Dominguez High Principal Ernie Roy said 
over the audio-video link during a demonstration last week. "We feel there is 
no limit to what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
University President Robert Detweiler praised the system as being on "the 
cutting edge of today's educational technology." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a boy," Detweiler pointed out, "distant learning meant walking two 
miles to school."

MEDICINAL PURPOSES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH AND HAPPINESS BY DIANE JOHNSON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 255 PP.; 
0-394-58717-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Cheever, Cheever's most recent novel is Doctors and Women (Landmark 
Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatsoever house I enter, there I will go for the benefit of the sick, 
refraining from all wrongdoing or corruption, and especially from any act of 
seduction of male or female, of bond or free. 
</P>
<P>
So reads the Hippocratic oath, written in the 4th Century BC as a code of 
behavior for physicians. But 24 centuries is a long, long time. These days, the 
relationship between a male doctor and his female patient has become an erotic 
time bomb, ticking away in the territory between professional ethics and the 
inevitable interactions between a man wearing the white coat of authority and a 
naked woman in need. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Johnson, an experienced writer whose readable, sparkling prose is 
combined with an intense moral seriousness, has taken on the exploration of 
this territory in her novel "Health and Happiness." Johnson is a master 
storyteller, and the issues that the book addresses, issues arising out of a 
situation in which individual men have the power of life and death over other 
men -- and women -- are gracefully manifested in characters who intersect with 
each other's lives in a fascinating and satisfying narrative. 
</P>
<P>
The book's heroine is Ivy Tarro, the nursing single-mother of an infant 
daughter. Ivy lives in a spare San Francisco apartment with a great view, and 
works in a trendy restaurant. Her swollen arm, which turns out to be nothing 
more than a clogged mammary gland, is misdiagnosed by her own doctor and then 
by Dr. Bradford Evans of Alta Buena Hospital as a serious axillary vein 
thrombosis. Because of the misdiagnosis, she is treated with the wrong drug, 
and when she reacts badly she is given more of it. 
</P>
<P>
During the three weeks Ivy spends in the hospital, while she sickens, almost 
dies and recovers, the life of the hospital becomes more real to her than her 
real life. There she meets Mimi Franklin, the good-hearted paid volunteer whose 
serenity has been shattered because the hospital wants to buy her house in 
order to tear it down and expand parking facilities. Mimi has had a disastrous 
affair with Dr. Evans, and like many women at the hospital, she has a crush on 
the handsome, powerful Dr. Philip Watts, who is as famous for his perfect 
marriage to a blond heiress named Jennifer as he is for his grace under 
pressure. "It would be easy enough to think herself a little in love with 
Philip Watts," Mimi muses. "Such a bundle of manly qualities!" 
</P>
<P>
But Philip Watts, the man who has his life and his career completely and 
satisfyingly under control, is not destined to have a comfortable affair with 
Mimi Franklin. He is destined to fall hopelessly, totally in love with the 
flaky, irrational Ivy Tarro, a woman whose head never has a chance against her 
heart. "She was a young red-headed woman of exceptional beauty," Dr. Philip 
Watts notes in his last dispassionate observation of Ivy. "This he noticed in 
spite of himself -- the cloud of red hair, the camellia-like pallor. From this 
distance he could not see the condition of her arm. But her beauty claimed his 
notice as a loud noise might, like someone dropping a bottle behind you, or a 
truck backfiring, the sound impinging on the consciousness of an unwilling man 
who was thinking about something else." 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson's narrative seamlessly shifts from Philip's point of view to Ivy's 
and Mimi's and back again, each of their lives is changed. First the 
imperturbable Philip Watts finds himself blowing up at another doctor about the 
way he's dressed. The change climaxes when Watts, always a stickler for 
protocol, finds himself storming into the operating theater to rescue Ivy from 
the surgeons' knives. In doing so, he almost hits the surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
For a conventional doctor, this kind of intervention with colleagues is a 
violation of all hospital procedures. But Philip Watts is no longer a 
conventional doctor, he is a man in love. As he looks down at Ivy Tarro, he 
changes. "Her face, even with the calm of anesthesia, bore traces of anguish. 
He thought he could discern a tear stain, a dampness at the hairline where her 
head was wrapped in a bandage of sterile cloth. He was moved in a way that he 
was at a loss to put a name to. Relief and success were surely part of it -- he 
had frustrated the surgeons and rescued the young woman. . . . He had a strong 
impulse to pick her up and carry her in his arms to safety, like a fireman." 
</P>
<P>
Each character in the book is perfectly drawn, from the ditzy Jennifer, who 
agonizes about the morality of eating shellfish because it may have a high pain 
threshold, to the threatening bureaucrat from Alta Buena who tries to bully 
Mimi into selling her house, to the malicious Chinese exchange student. Johnson 
gets the way doctors treat each other -- their rivalries, comradeships and 
indecipherable language -- just right: "Dr. Evans made the diagnosis of a blood 
clot of unknown origin obstructing the subclavian vein, and this was 
substantiated by a venogram," one doctor explains to another. 
</P>
<P>
Ivy herself is an enchanting and sensitive character. She wakes up from her 
fever one night with the sense that someone is hiding in the room she shares 
with another patient. "Death in the room. Ivy could feel his gaze on her too," 
she thinks in a panic. "A choking sensation in her throat became so intense 
that she was obliged to struggle to sit up a little. She opened her eyes. She 
stared at the hem of the dividing curtain, expecting death's shoes and pantlegs 
to be visible as he quietly stood over her friend in the other bed." 
</P>
<P>
This is not a novel about death but about life, and about the sneaky way that 
love and life conspire to triumph over death, even in a hospital, even with 
doctors and their patients.

A CHILDHOOD FROM HELL; 
</P>
<P>
A HOLE IN THE WORLD: AN AMERICAN BOYHOOD BY RICHARD RHODES (SIMON &amp; 
SCHUSTER: $19.95; 224 PP.; 0-671-69066-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Frederick Busch, Busch's most recent novel is Harry and Catherine published 
this year by Alfred A. Knopf. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Hole in the World" must be read through tears -- the reader's and the 
writer's -- and it must be acknowledged as powerful a bearing of witness, as 
dark a story of cruelty, as redemptive a proclamation of the soul's strength as 
we have been given in a very long time. Nothing by the prolific and talented 
Richard Rhodes -- who has written first-rate fiction and nonfiction for years, 
and whose "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" was awarded the National Book Award 
and the Pulitzer Prize -- prepares us for this shattering testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The subtitle becomes an indictment of an America where such terrible moments 
(and hours and days and years) can befall boys: Richard and Stanley Rhodes were 
terrorized by the woman their father married some years after his first wife, 
the boys' mother, committed suicide in Kansas City, Kan., in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Richard was in his crib, 13 months old, when Stanley found their mother's body 
and observed the damage inflicted by the 12-gauge shotgun that Georgia Collier 
Rhodes had put in her mouth before firing. Rhodes' memoir is an effort to fill 
the hole blown into his world by the shot his mother triggered. The wound grew 
vast when, nine years later, his father married Anne, the boys' stepmother. She 
tortured them for more than two years, until the courts removed them to the 
Andrew Drumm Institute, a private home for boys. 
</P>
<P>
Using interviews with his older brother (and letters from him), reports of 
social workers, diaries, newspaper articles and the recollections of relatives, 
Rhodes assembles the story. He assembles the boys themselves and re-creates 
their torment. 
</P>
<P>
His father was a boilermaker's helper who worked in a roundhouse in Kansas 
City. Here is Rhodes' description of the building: 
</P>
<P>
"We entered a darkness of brick and soot-blackened windows, a cavern of hammers 
and forges, a huge smithy. Steam locomotives long and looming as ocean liners 
could be clocked around on track sections within its vastness and repaired. The 
forges glowed like campfires. The hammer faces rang like bells and threw 
firefalls of iron sparks. Sulfur and iron gritted the air, cinders of coal 
smoke scratched my eyes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This Dickensian vision evokes not only trains but also a small creature in a 
huge world. As we read of the motherless boys drifting with their father to 
different boardinghouses over the years, and of the frightened child in strange 
rooms -- "I began to be afraid that he was never coming back," Richard thought 
about his father -- we remember that Dickens' genius lay not in inventing the 
terrors of childhood but in reminding us that we suffered them. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes did, and long before his wicked stepmother appeared. Sensitive, always 
fretful, he sees a ragman out of Dickens: "Two dark, bony horses with wild 
manes pulled his wagon on iron tires. He was dark and bony like his horses. His 
eyes burned, sweeping across the lawns. The wagon was piled with rags and 
broken furniture and dirty mattresses, buckets hanging off. . . . Up the hill . 
. . he came . . . I hid behind the elm. What if he stole me?" 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Stanley weren't stolen by Anne; they were handed over by their 
father. Think of "Hansel and Gretel": The stepmother convinces the father that, 
since there isn't enough food, the children should be abandoned in the forest 
to die; she and her husband will thus have the household's provender. After 
small objection, the father sighs, "Ah, but I shall regret the poor children." 
</P>
<P>
That is all Richard's father did. And therefore when, in 1949, a social worker 
investigated the children's plight, it was recorded that Stanley, at 13 and 
standing 5-foot-4, weighed 97 pounds; Richard, at 12 and 4-foot-11, weighed 80 
pounds. "For two years, to discipline us, to punish us and to maximize her 
profits from our labor" -- she sent them out selling goods door-to-door, or 
working all day for small wages, which she kept -- "our stepmother not only 
beat us, but systematically starved us. Dad let it happen, protesting when he 
dared but too intimidated to protect us." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers felt forced to supply them with milk after seeing their 
single-sandwich lunches -- "She demanded we confine the tablespoonful of jelly 
to the center of the bread" -- and at home the children were given either 
black-eyed peas or hard-boiled eggs: "She allowed a pot of eggs she was cooking 
to boil dry and burn (from careless reheating, the peas were routinely burned); 
we ate the burned eggs, burned protein like burned hair, or went hungry. We 
went hungry anyway, while she and Dad dined on pork chops and even steak." 
</P>
<P>
None of Rhodes' assertions is merely the angry accusation of a damaged man; 
everything he tells us is grounded in the observations of others. The children 
were starved, hit with broom handles, mops, the high heels of shoes; they were 
slapped; they were lashed with a belt buckle; they were dressed in rags that 
weren't cleaned or repaired; they were not bathed or shampooed. The stepmother 
worked not only from without: Assaulting them from within, she forced them to 
drink cod-liver oil by beating the child who resisted. She forbade Richard to 
urinate at night while she slept. The child, of course, lay awake, feeling his 
need, fearing reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes describes a snapshot taken at that time: "Stanley's obviously emaciated. 
I look like an Auschwitz child." The long section about "My stepmother, my 
commandant" is called "Arbeit Macht Frei" (work makes you free), the taunting 
slogan displayed over the gates of Auschwitz. Rhodes refers to "the 
concentration camp of our stepmother"; she is "like Klaus Barbie," the Nazi 
murderer. The boys were the prisoners of someone whose madness, and the 
complaisance of whose husband, recapitulated the shattering truths of the 
Holocaust: that evil may prevail; that innocence is not protected; that 
punishment need not be deserved; that we may be crushed because someone 
stronger wills it. 
</P>
<P>
Richard was drawn to books that "populated my desolation." He was drawn to 
science and science fiction -- to facts on which he might rely, and to escape 
from the life to which he was condemned. So powerful was his drive to buy pulp 
science fiction with stolen quarters that, "shaking with hunger but with only a 
quarter to spend, I wept tears of frustration at having to choose between 
buying food and buying a pulp. Even hungry I more often chose the pulp." 
</P>
<P>
The boy was fascinated by a Life magazine photo of an atomic-bomb explosion. He 
became the man who, later in his life, "dreamed of mushroom clouds boiling up 
from Kansas City, dreamed of fleeing the doomed city eastward, of looking back 
over my shoulder horrified but somehow also relieved, still a survivor." He 
wanted his revenge. 
</P>
<P>
The boy who was starved enjoyed working, in the Drumm Institute, at the 
slaughtering and butchering of livestock. One day, watching the guts being 
burned, he saw the tubing of a steer's innards "expanding like an alien life 
form, like a nuclear fireball. . . ." He wanted his escape and his revenge. 
</P>
<P>
So this was the man who wrote of hunger and cannibalism in his novel, "The 
Ungodly." This was the man so honored for "The Making of the Atomic Bomb." This 
was the man who, first trying to write -- language was to be his escape, the 
statement of his anger -- was "afraid . . . that releasing the rage I'd 
restrained across the years would be more than the world could bear": He was in 
his 30s, was 5-foot-10, weighed 132 pounds and was nauseated by food. 
Psychotherapy, and the drive to bear witness to his horrors, set him free to 
write his rage. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes survived two broken marriages, and so did his children. He survived 
alcoholism, depression and his childhood cruelties "to tell my orphan's story, 
as all orphans do; to introduce you to my child." He acknowledges that his 
child, his sad and vulnerable self, found light as well as darkness through the 
broken-hearted generosities of salesgirls who sneaked him food, of women in 
boardinghouses who held and cared for him, of public-school teachers and Drumm 
Institute men, of the women and men who made it possible for him to attend 
Yale, with books to study and clothes on his back. 
</P>
<P>
And of course there was Stanley, a gallant big brother, who watched over 
Richard as well as he could. Rhodes writes the book "For Stanley and Richard," 
the two little children whose history he plumbs in order to find out who he is. 
</P>
<P>
That he can love them and make language for them, that he can create the child 
on our behalf, and his, and Stanley's, and thereby re-create the man Richard 
Rhodes, is a major redemption. 
</P>
<P>
It is a triumph over the worst in us by whatever in us is any good at all. 
</P>

WHAT'S THAT PIG OUTDOORS?; A MEMOIR OF DEAFNESS BY HENRY KISOR FOREWORD BY 
WALKER PERCY (HILL &amp; WANG: $18.95; 270 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Cahill, Cahill is director of Religious Publishing for Doubleday and 
co-author of the forthcoming Why Your Ears Are Crooked (Ballantine).

<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Kisor, whose story this is, is stone deaf and has been so since an 
illness at age 3. Now in his 50s, he is a working journalist at the height of 
his profession, book editor of the Chicago Sun-Times, husband (of a hearing 
woman), and father of college-age sons. Between the illness of the child and 
the success of the man lies the story, a lifelong struggle against what Dr. 
Johnson rightly called "the most desperate of human calamities." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they would, if they had to, choose blindness or deafness, 
most people choose deafness. And this is because living always in the dark 
strikes us as unimaginably horrible. But, in truth, anyone who has successively 
experienced the deprivations of sight and hearing has no trouble making the 
right choice: blindness. For blindness, though it cuts us off from the visible 
world, does not cut us off from communication -- from humankind -- as no one 
who has read Carson McCuller's "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" can ever forget. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome the permanent, radical loneliness of the deaf requires both 
enormous will power and great good luck. And even with both these commodities 
in abundant supply, the most routine matter can bring defeat. The title, 
"What's That Pig Outdoors?" is Kisor's way of reminding the hearing world that 
even the simplest question, posed by the smallest child, can be misunderstood 
by a lip-reading deaf man. (The child actually asked about a "big loud noise.") 
</P>
<P>
Kisor's pride in his parents, especially his mother, becomes the reader's pride 
-- it's nice just to belong to the same species as such people. They never gave 
up, and their assumption that their son would succeed became his assumption -- 
as taken for granted as the air they breathed. The parents followed the program 
of an unorthodox teacher, Doris Irene Mirrielees, who believed in teaching the 
child first to read, then to practice lip-reading and sound-making. 
</P>
<P>
At age 4 (when most deaf children are learning only the most rudimentary 
language), Henry became a fluent reader -- and a more reluctant practitioner of 
the sounds he could not hear. "Mother had to be my jailer as well as teacher. 
Four- and five-year-olds have the attention spans of shrews; ten minutes after 
beginning a two-hour session, I'd demand to be let out to play with my friends. 
. . . Some days degenerated into a two-hour contest of wills. I was adamant, 
but Mother was immovable. Until every last lesson of the day had been learned, 
she wouldn't release me from battleground to playground." 
</P>
<P>
Kisor became, thanks to his parents' unsentimental love and his own 
intelligence, a part of the hearing world. But this development was forged 
despite a gaggle of self-appointed busybodies (who were scandalized that a deaf 
child was allowed out unescorted) and recognized experts (who thought Henry 
needed therapy because he was "tense" and "hostile" after six hours of tests or 
-- later on, in his teens -- because he exhibited a propensity for "adolescent 
sexual fantasy"). 
</P>
<P>
When Kisor chose journalism, the experts thought he was delusional. And yet, it 
is hard, reading this book today, to imagine Kisor ever having become anything 
but a journalist. It is not merely that he writes well: It is that the sculpted 
clarity of each sentence gives such pleasure. No one could ever misunderstand 
this writer.

LOUD AND CLEAR BY LAKE HEADLEY WITH WILLIAM HOFFMAN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 288 
PP; 0-8050-1138-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Bowden, Bowden's most recent book is Red Line. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 11:34 a.m. on June 2, 1976, newspaper reporter Don Bolles started his car in 
downtown Phoenix. Later they found parts of him atop a four-story building 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Bolles survived the car bomb for 11 days as busy doctors cut off a leg, then an 
arm, then the other leg. Passersby who rushed to the scene of the blast heard 
the last words Bolles would ever utter: "Telephone my wife. They finally got 
me. The Mafia. Emprise. Find John Adamson." Good reporter to the end, he made 
sure he filed before he died. 
</P>
<P>
What has been done about Don Bolles' last file is the basis of this book by 
Lake Headley, a Las Vegas private investigator. John Harvey Adamson, a local 
small-time hoodlum, now sits on Arizona's Death Row for the homicide. Emprise, 
a vast corporation based on sports and gambling, one with a history of Mafia 
ties, remains untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the Mafia itself weathered the storm that resulted from the 
slaughter of an investigative reporter. The case remains essentially unsolved 
-- Adamson at best was a cog in a larger killing machine. Who he worked with 
and who he worked for has been left a mystery by the state's cops and 
prosecutors. A national team of investigative reporters descended on Phoenix 
after the murder, but they also came up with nothing on the crime itself -- 
although plenty on the basic patterns of corruption by good old boys and 
gangsters that has long been an Arizona custom. 
</P>
<P>
Max Dunlap and James Robison were charged along with Adamson in the Bolles 
killing and both were sentenced to death. Adamson plea-bargained to a lesser 
charge. Headley was hired by a committee of Dunlap's friends to clear him, and 
eventually, the state's Supreme Court overturned the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
When Adamson refused to testify at a retrial, the case against the two men 
collapsed. Dunlap went free, Robinson was sentenced on other charges. Adamson 
was retried and shipped to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Headley makes a strong case for the innocence of Dunlap and Robison, but his 
greater purpose is to characterize the leaders of the state as a group of 
corrupt liars. He spins a web that involves Barry Goldwater, the Phoenix Police 
Department, the state's attorney general and 1988 presidential candidate Bruce 
Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
The two Phoenix newspapers, the Arizona Republic (which employed Bolles) and 
the Phoenix Gazette, come off as incompetent at best. Anyone who reads the two 
dailies will find it hard to disagree. Like any zealous effort at mudslinging, 
Headley manages to make some of the dirt stick. 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, the book is ill written: "Inmates sweltered in sizzling slow summers 
and shivered when whistling winter winds chased in all manner of wilderness 
vermin.. . ." The action mainly proceeds through the device of absolutely 
wooden dialogue and none of the people in the book, including Headley, ever 
seem alive for a single instant. 
</P>
<P>
Setting aside these unfortunate facts, it still is worth reading for those 
interested in a case of Sun Belt politics -- a passion, to be sure, akin to 
necrophilia. The book presents numerous instances of corruption -- cops 
destroying files; attorneys seemingly railroading defendants; witnesses being 
ignored; the rich and the powerful, for example the Goldwater brothers and the 
folks at Emprise, being spared serious questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Various theories are tossed out about who might have wanted Bolles hit, and the 
book wanders into the politics of the Navajo reservation, and the ties between 
Mafia figures and Arizona leaders. But these possibilities and sketchy 
scenarios are more tantalizing than convincing. Headley also notes that many 
threats were made on his own life while conducting the investigation: The book 
ends with what he considers a suspicious apartment fire that severely injured 
and almost killed him and his wife-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
The information he presents is frequently not new; much of it was put forth in 
press conferences he held over a decade ago. So why write the book now? In 
part, I suspect, in order to make some money, maybe get a movie deal -- the 
normal motives that drive people to print. But the other reason, I think, lies 
in the nature of the Bolles case itself. 
</P>
<P>
Someone slaughtered a very good and dedicated investigative reporter in the 
heart of a large American city in broad daylight, and got away with it. This is 
supposed to be business as usual in banana republics, not in the United States. 
People keep looking into the Bolles case because they do not like the obvious 
answers the bombing presents: that you can kill, you can cover up the act, you 
can -- at least in Phoenix, Arizona, -- literally get away with murder. 
</P>
<P>
That's why when Hollywood makes a movie about the press, the producers pick a 
property such as "All the President's Men" where the good guys win. The Bolles 
case is one Western nobody wants to put on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
In this version of "High Noon," Gary Cooper gets blown away on Main Street and 
business, well, it's business as usual.

I stand up and salute Shane Black ("Portrait of a Young Millionaire," by James 
Greenberg, Aug. 19). 
</P>
<P>
He and the other writers who are cashing in on the era of spec scripts deserve 
every penny not skimmed by 10-percenters and greedy producers. 
</P>
<P>
I was writing on spec long before Bart Simpson was born, and I've also been 
rejected more than Elvis has been sighted, so I can appreciate this new wave of 
hope for the unknown and unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
I just need to know: Who do these writers know that I don't know?

Your article on scriptwriter Shane Black and the Pad O' Guys made it instantly 
clear to me why current American films are in the hammerlock of a macho-buddy, 
total-whammo, blast-'em, kick-'em-in-the-groin mentality. These creative 
talents have been raised on the culture of their times: pop fiction and TV. 
Their creative output is just so much fast-pizza delivery: Load it up, get it 
there fast, and don't pick up the empty boxes.

<P>
It is 1990, isn't it? I wasn't sure after I read the article on Shane Black and 
all the other nice, young, white, male successful screenwriters. For some crazy 
reason, I figured that in 1990 we must have a few females and minority groups 
represented in one end of the business or another. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenberg's article did not mention one female or ethnic group in any facet 
of the industry -- no writers, no agents, no producers, nobody. Was there no 
one who suggested to your writer that in the year 1990 he might be able to find 
a few newly successful female or minority writers? And if he couldn't, wouldn't 
that be a fact worthy of mention? 
</P>
<P>
It was an interesting contrast to Robin Wright's excellent article on South 
Africa, to say the least.

BLACK SCARS, WHITE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a little girl and my mother would speak of conditions in South 
Africa, I would ask, "How can a handful of white people control all those black 
people?" My mother said that they didn't know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
I am about to have my first child, and I seek concrete answers for the day I am 
asked about South Africa, Germany, the Middle East and conditions in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
This article was very informative and honest. 
</P>
<P>
What we, as human beings, need to engrave in our lives is that life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness are natural inalienable rights of all people that 
no one may infringe upon. 
</P>
<P>
Scars can be healed through nurturing, and fears can be removed through 
education. From D. Ikeda: "All people are equal. There are absolutely no 
distinctions of superior and inferior among human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Keep up the outstanding work.

MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH . . . ; 
</P>
<P>
RELATIVE DISTANCES BY VICTORIA JENKINS (PEREGRINE SMITH BOOKS: $15.95; 144 PP.; 
0-879905-251-1) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Freeman, Freeman is the author of The Chinchilla Farm and Family 
Attractions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victoria Jenkins' slim little novel, "Relative Distances," is an almost perfect 
depiction of the austere realities of ranching life and the consequences of 
such a difficult, isolated existence. Set in Wyoming, it features a family 
whose ties have been so stretched that they seem to have snapped, leaving each 
member to fend emotionally for himself. The tale centers on Myra Wells, a 
hapless, 36-year-old drifter who drives an old Cadillac, a "relic of a past 
romance . . . red under layers of highway-sprayed slush," and drags behind it a 
mobile home, suggesting the rootlessness that has plagued her troubled life. 
</P>
<P>
With the sort of unceremonious impetuousness that seems to have marked much of 
her life, Myra dumps her boyfriend Vernon, who scrambles to grab his belongings 
from her trailer before she tows it away. She has decided to return to the 
Wyoming ranching community where she grew up, in the hope she might save what 
is left of her future. 
</P>
<P>
Married at 14, a mother at 15 and divorced a few years later, Myra long ago 
left her son Tom behind and began wandering from one dead-end job to another, 
running a boarding house in a bleak little town, working in construction and 
mining, going through lovers the way some people do shoes. Her parents are 
dead; all that's left of her immediate family is her son Tom and her cousin 
Arlen, who seduced her when she was 13 and for whom she still harbors 
complicated and romantic feelings. 
</P>
<P>
It's been so long since she's seen her son that he's grown up in her absence 
and is now a young man of 20, working on Arlen's ranch. Their reunion is 
poignantly awkward. When she encircles him with her arms, he stands passive, 
and quietly says, "Hi, Ma." She tells him, "Me and Vernon have split up." 
"Who's Vernon?" he asks, emphasizing how little he knows about the life of the 
stranger who is his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Arlen gives her a job on the ranch, though inevitably her return stirs things 
up. Arlen's own marriage has dried up. He stays with his wife, Florence, out of 
economic convenience and sneaks off to town to see his girlfriend, a plump 
woman named Valerie Pruitt who seems willing to put up with his taciturnity out 
of sheer boredom. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, Arlen and Florence don't seem overly happy to have Myra back. It's as if 
their own harsh lives have made them indifferent to the fates of others. 
Arlen's son, Neal, however, looks upon Myra as a welcome addition to life on 
the ranch. Caught on the cusp of manhood, Neal finds her a romantic prospect, 
in spite of the fact Myra is 16 years his senior, as well as his second-cousin. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins is good at evoking the day-to-day life on a ranch, the unglamorous 
realities of hardscrabble existence, as well as the warmth of drop-in neighbors 
who offer up no-nonsense hospitality in cluttered kitchens. Her descriptions of 
milking, calving and branding, her feeling for horses and her depiction of the 
immensity of the landscape imbue her writing with the details that lend her 
story its richness. She also is adept at swiftly summing up character. She can 
impart a sense of a lifelong marriage in a few sentences, as in this 
description of Arlen's sister Rosemary and her husband, Ray: 
</P>
<P>
"She was the oldest; a big-boned, graceless woman with indoor skin and an 
invalid petulance, who had jumped as a girl, when fortune smiled, to marry Ray 
Macky, a cowboy from east of the river with a walleye and, at thirty, false 
teeth and a head smooth and white as an egg on top. . . . Arthritis stiffened 
and skewed Rosemary's hands and cortisone puffed her. Some days she never got 
out of her housecoat. Ray treated her like a jewel, fastening buttons and 
shampooing her head under the kitchen faucet with gentle fingers, and 
conspiring with her in the public fiction that things were otherwise, rising 
most mornings from the couch to make his own coffee and carry a cup in to her 
along with the first four aspirins of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Myra is equally well-drawn, although more complex and sadder, primarily because 
she's such a loner. Arlen had laid in the back of her mind "like a remittent 
destiny" and her feelings for him could easily develop into passion again were 
it not for his attachment to Valerie Pruitt. Instead, her eye drifts toward 
Neal, and during the annual cattle drive to summer pasture, the emotions that 
have built up finally explode. 
</P>
<P>
The West is a place of challenge where everyone is encouraged to live out his 
own myth, but in this bittersweet novel, Jenkins seems to be saying that too 
often the myths end up being so circumscribed by poverty and struggle and 
limited choices as to seem more like cruel fate. Nature is perhaps the most 
celebrated aspect of life, not human fortunes, which are impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing, however, impoverished about this first novel, which has a 
pure and unforced beauty, and a lovely heart-rending honesty.

Violet Hunt, born in 1862 in the north of England, grew up among Victorian 
notables such as John Ruskin, Andrew Lang and Robert Browning. Her father, the 
respected watercolorist Alfred Hunt, and her mother, Margaret Hunt, the author 
of a dozen or so of the three-decker novels popular until late in the 19th 
Century, moved with their three small daughters to London when Violet was 4. 
</P>
<P>
At 17, she engaged in a prolonged flirtation with the young Oscar Wilde, her 
"sole ethereal love, pure and above reproach, the last of her consummated 
adolescent dreams." Thereafter, she dedicated her emotional life to one 
decidedly unethereal (and inappropriate) love after another, among them painter 
George Boughton, diplomat and publisher Oswald Crawfurd and writers H. G. 
Wells, W. Somerset Maugham and Ford Madox Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Like her mother, Violet earned not merely a reputation as a literary hostess 
but also a living through her writing. Before her death at age 79, she had 
published "poetry . . . and seventeen novels . . . two collections of stories, 
her memoirs of the Ford years and the biography of Lizzie Siddal, in addition 
to six collaborations . . . two book translations, and numerous critical 
articles and short stories that appeared in London newspapers and magazines"; 
none of her work remains in print. Among her literary friends, she numbered, in 
addition to her lovers, such diverse figures as Henry James, D. H. Lawrence and 
Radclyffe Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A life so long, reasonably prosperous and variously populated should not, on 
the face of it, seem dreary; but alas, as Barbara Belford presents it in 
"Violet," it holds little charm. Part of the problem may lie in the character 
herself. Considered "a great beauty, with deepset smoldering brown eyes under 
heavy-hooded lids . . . auburn hair . . . pale, magnolia skin," Violet 
inherited her mother's "sharp, witty tongue." But although occasionally the 
comments Belford draws from her diaries and letters are droll ("I always do ask 
for what I want -- of a man and especially of a man with reddish hair") none 
reveals a rapier wit. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the details of her life demonstrate a genius for sustaining unhappy 
liaisons, which dominate Belford's account. With Crawfurd, who infected her 
with syphilis, she shared the capacity for "fueling desire, particularly at 
keeping jealousy -- that great aphrodisiac -- alive during a seven-year affair 
that was rooted more in remorse than love." 
</P>
<P>
Her subsequent relationship with Ford lasted a decade, all but a year of which 
apparently was mired in even greater suspicion, lies, recrimination, spying and 
finally outright loathing. Nonetheless, so addicted was she to the adulation of 
men that "she never stopped trying to make new conquests, even in her sixties." 
At the close of her life, scrawny, irritable, syphilitic, her mind further 
muddled by age and alcohol, she cut anything but the "pretty figure" she had 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Still, subjects need not be paragons to elicit fine studies of their lives. 
Neither Sylvia Plath nor D. H. Lawrence was a particularly winsome creature, 
but both their biographers display a fascination and an engagement that Belford 
hasn't been able to muster up. Perhaps, as a professor of journalism at the 
Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia, she construed her task as more 
reportorial than responsive; but without some enthusiasm, whether positive or 
negative, a biographer has trouble sustaining her own and thus her readers' 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
Belford's research is thorough, her writing fluent, but only occasionally does 
a comment sparkle with insight or humor, as when, of Gaudier's marble head of 
Ezra Pound, ensconced for years on Violet's lawn, she remarks dryly, "Having a 
marble phallus in the front yard did little to enhance Violet's 
respectability." 
</P>
<P>
Nor has Belford found a successful strategy for interpreting her material 
coherently. Her stabs at feminist analysis, for instance, tend to take the form 
of platitudes like "In deciding to be a 'new woman,' in rejecting wifely and 
motherly conduct, Violet found herself part of a pernicious dualism that viewed 
woman as either virgin or whore." Her limited understanding of feminism leads 
her into some real howlers: "Always a feminist in her thinking, (Violet) now 
acted like one and joined the Women's Social and Political Union. . . . The 
marches, arrests and confrontations filled a lonely, loverless life and 
provided drama." London's militant suffragists, beaten, imprisoned and 
force-fed, might have been more than a little startled to think that their 
cause would one day be construed as a dramatic diversion for the lovelorn. 
</P>
<P>
The book's protracted subtitle may reflect its central flaw: Here is a woman 
whose appeal seems to lie solely in the company she kept. And according to 
Belford, Violet already has appeared as "a bewitching but minor character in 
biographies of Wilde, Ford, Maugham, Wells, James, Pound and Lawrence." 
</P>
<P>
Those flittings might have sufficed.

MRS. HUMPHRY WARD; EMINENT VICTORIAN, PREEMINENT EDWARDIAN BY JOHN SUTHERLAND 
(OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95; 432 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
On April 10, 1920, Virginia Woolf noted in her diary, "Mrs. Ward is dead; poor 
Mrs. Humphry Ward; and it appears that she was merely a woman of straw after 
all -- shovelled into the grave and already forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ward had been dead two weeks. Seventy years later, although largely 
unread, she is not altogether forgotten, and John Sutherland's bold 
disinterment of this prolific writer and prodigious personality who towered 
over Victorian and Edwardian England makes enthralling reading. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of her fame, Mrs. Humphry Ward, as she always styled herself 
(less a gesture of matronly modesty than a claim to masculine authority), 
commanded vast readerships and vast advances on both sides of the Atlantic. 
From 1888, America was swamped by competing pirate editions of "Robert 
Elsmere," her mammoth novel of religious doubt. To her horror, free copies were 
given away with Maine's Balsam Fir Soap, described by Sutherland, with typical 
dryness, as "a newly launched product which wished to impress on consumers the 
literal truth of cleanliness being next to godliness." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland compares the novel's American success to that of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" 
in Britain, both nations being virtuously fascinated by problems they did not 
have to face. The issue now raised, in Oliver Wendell Holmes' words, was the 
long-needed purging of "the obstructed channels of the decrepit theological 
system," and even, so it was thought, the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the excitement was caused by the reaction of Gladstone, the British 
prime minister to whom the book represented a dangerous national trend toward 
agnosticism. He wrote a long, vehement, essay, "Robert Elsmere, and the Battle 
of Belief," and, obsessed by the book, demanded a private interview with its 
author on the evening after her mother's death. Their passionate argument was 
resumed at breakfast; she left "the wonderful old man" white-faced, leaning on 
the table, while she, trembling but unbeaten, went to follow the hearse. 
</P>
<P>
The encounter typifies more than Mary Ward's love of a good fight. She wrote, 
Sutherland suggests, precisely to prove herself to men of authority and power 
like Gladstone; the heirs of her grandfather, Thomas Arnold of Rugby: Jowett, 
Pattison and Pater at Oxford and J. R. Green in London; and above all, her own 
errant, backsliding father, Tom, and her uncle, Matthew Arnold. Her best novels 
-- "Robert Elsmere," "Marcella" and the fine "Helbeck of Bannisdale" -- 
re-worked not only her own experience but the religious rifts that drove her 
parents, and her age, apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Matt" memorably dismissed Mary's first novel, "Miss Bretherton," 
published in 1884: "No Arnold can write a novel; if they could, I should have 
done it" -- doubly cruel, since she so wanted acceptance as a true Arnold. 
Nonetheless, she went on to become, in Sutherland's phrase, a "fiction 
machine," churning out novels to support her family. 
</P>
<P>
Her earnings were high, and her fiction was serialized for top prices in 
America in the Century, Harpers and the Ladies' Home Journal (whose cheap 
presentation galled her pride while it filled her purse). But rather than 
helping her family, she may have crushed them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband Humphry, art critic of the Times of London, took refuge in buying 
old masters (often fakes) and playing billiards at the Athenaeum. Refusing to 
enfranchise her clever daughters, Mary heaped her ambitions on her son, the 
ominously christened Arnold: Ineffectual in politics, disgraced in the army, 
his gambling debts absorbed all she had so laboriously gained. 
</P>
<P>
Irony also marks Mary Ward's other achievements. A founder of Somerville, the 
first women's college in Oxford, in 1879, she went on to become the tireless 
leader of the Anti-Suffrage Movement and to write a virulently anti-suffragist 
novel, "Delia Blanchflower." She opened two settlements for the London poor 
(University Hall and the Passmore Edwards Settlement), started the day-center 
movement and introduced schools for the physically handicapped, but spent her 
last years among the Hertfordshire gentry, a staunch Conservative and 
imperialist. 
</P>
<P>
A final flourish of transatlantic fame followed her vivid, jingoistic accounts 
of life in the trenches. The first of these, "England's Effort," was written in 
response to a suggestion made in December of 1915 by her friend, former 
President Theodore Roosevelt, that articles from Mary Ward, who was at the 
time, Sutherland says, "the best-known Englishwoman in America," might help him 
to swing American opinion in favor of entering the war. 
</P>
<P>
What lay behind her urgent, swerving career? In 1856, when she was 5, her 
family returned to England after Tom Arnold's first swing to Catholicism had 
put an end to a promising career as education secretary in Tasmania. When her 
parents, with her younger brothers and sisters, decamped to live under John 
Henry Newman's wing in Dublin, Mary was left stranded in Westmoreland with her 
Arnold grandmother. Lonely and fiery-tempered, she struggled through grim 
boarding schools for the next 10 years until she rejoined her family, by now 
established in Oxford. From then on, Sutherland portrays her as driven by a 
desperate need to be "at the center" -- of Oxford, London, the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Steely self-will and hidden vulnerability were blended in her dealings with her 
family, her publishers and her political allies. All are meticulously 
chronicled here. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland's approach, though cool and unblinkered, is consistently 
sympathetic; yet even he sometimes displays an appalled fascination at his 
subject's monstrous energy, all the more striking since she was wracked by 
constant, devastating illnesses (which, like those of Josephine Butler or 
Florence Nightingale, often proved strategically useful). She battled on 
against all odds, dosing herself with remedies that would make a pharmacist 
pale, including a cherished hoard of "cocaine lozenges." 
</P>
<P>
As the Great War ended, younger writers -- Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, H. 
G. Wells, Rebecca West -- attacked or ridiculed "Mrs H. W." as the embodiment 
of the most stifling Victorian values. Their hostility was a measure of her 
power. Even 16 years after she died, her nephew Aldous Huxley drew her as the 
smothering Mrs. Foxe in "Eyeless in Gaza." 
</P>
<P>
She left no literary heirs, and in that sense she was, as Woolf said, "a woman 
of straw." But "splendid" was Mary Ward's favorite adjective -- and splendid, 
in an awesome, even tragic way -- is exactly what she was.

AT ODDS WITH HIS GOVERNMENT FOR THREE DECADES, CHINA'S LEADING DISSIDENT IS 
FREE AT LAST -- AND TORN BETWEEN POLITICS AND SCIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
On June 24, Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, spent their last night in 
China and their first night in a year sleeping outside an elaborately concealed 
hiding place in the clinic of the U. S. Embassy in Beijing. After a farewell 
dinner with U. S. Ambassador James R. Lilley, they went to bed in a guest room 
at the ambassadorial residence. The next morning, accompanied by Lilley, they 
were escorted to Nanyuan Military Airport in a motorcade led by a Chinese 
police car bearing license plate No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they had traveled through the streets of Beijing, their car had 
sped along back routes, trying to avoid military patrols. It was the day after 
the bloody end of the pro-democracy movement, and they had been on their way to 
seek counsel at the embassy. Then the streets had been filled with People's 
Liberation Army soldiers and milling crowds; now the Fangs' route through the 
capital was lined with soldiers standing at attention. "It was just as if we 
were visiting heads of state," Fang would later say with a smile. In fact, it 
looked to Fang as if the Chinese Communist Party, which had so reviled him as 
the country's best-known dissident intellectual, was now giving him a grand 
send-off. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, the Fangs were met by a battery of grim-faced Chinese Foreign 
Ministry officials and photographers assigned to record this strange 
leave-taking. They boarded a U.S. Air Force C-135 jet, which had to be given 
special dispensation to land in China. Moments later, relieved to be on the 
verge of freedom but filled with ambivalence about leaving the country they had 
struggled so hard to serve, they found themselves winging their way out of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
THIRTEEN MONTHS EARLIER, AS BEIJING plunged into chaos, American Perry Link had 
hurried through the capital's dangerous streets to check on his friends Fang 
and Li. The date was June 4, 1989. Link was a professor of Chinese language and 
literature, in Beijing to administer scholarly exchanges for the National 
Academy of Sciences. On his way to the Fangs' apartment, he passed burning 
military vehicles at People's University and saw banners declaring "Mourn the 
Dead" and "Blood Debts Must Be Paid in Blood," the first reaction to the 
previous night, when troops had marched on Tian An Men Square, leaving carnage 
in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
Link found Fang and Li in a state of great agitation. Li was trembling and 
whispering hoarsely, he recalls. "They just kept saying, 'It's extremely 
dangerous, extremely dangerous: They've gone mad!' " Link recalled later. All 
the friends could do was trade rumors. As Link left to attend to his own 
family, Li pulled him aside and whispered in his ear: If she phoned and said, 
"Bring your children over to play," Link should take it to mean that she and 
Fang needed help -- and he should come at once. 
</P>
<P>
The call came about 5 p.m., and Link immediately took a taxi back to the Fangs' 
apartment. Friends had been telephoning, warning them that the Communist Party 
had issued a classified order announcing an imminent wave of arrests. "Some of 
those who called were rather important personages, and they all warned us that 
we were in great danger," Fang remembers. "They stressed that if we did not 
leave our home and seek refuge elsewhere, we would be arrested." 
</P>
<P>
After a quick discussion, Fang, Li and their 21-year-old son, Fang Zhe, decided 
to go to the Shangri-La Hotel, a large, nearby tourist establishment. Link knew 
that CBS News had rented an entire floor there. If Fang and Li were in a 
Western hotel, with members of the American press, Link reasoned, the Chinese 
government would be less inclined to try to arrest them. He extracted a promise 
of strict confidentiality from the CBS News staffers, as well as a pledge that 
they would keep a careful eye on the Fangs, and again hastened home. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Link found the Fangs even more shaken than the day before. 
Students at Beijing University, where Li taught physics, had reported that they 
expected the army to occupy their campus at any moment. Their options 
narrowing, Fang, Li and Fang Zhe decided to risk the nerve-racking six-mile 
ride across the city to inquire about temporary refuge at the U. S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
After skirting the combat zones by taking back streets, the Fangs had to find a 
way to get past the People's Liberation Army guards at the embassy gate. Link 
got out of the car, flashed his American passport and succeeded in getting the 
guards to open the gate. Then, while he distracted the sentries with 
explanations in his excellent Chinese, the Fangs hurried inside, where they 
raised McKinney Russell of the embassy's press and cultural section and Ray 
Burghardt, the acting deputy chief of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them that we thought the Chinese government was in a state of 
irrationality and that they might shoot anyone," Fang says. "We asked if we 
could stay until things quieted down, hoping that in one or two days, when the 
government had regained a semblance of rationality, and order had been 
restored, we could come out again. Above all, we told them, we did not want our 
presence in the embassy to be made known to the Chinese government." 
</P>
<P>
Russell and Burghardt pointed out that while "temporary refuge" was possible if 
the Fangs were willing to officially request it, listening devices presumably 
hidden throughout the embassy were doubtless already reporting their 
conversation to Chinese authorities. Moreover, they said, with so many Chinese 
staff members working in the mission, it was likely that their presence had 
been noticed. The response of the Chinese government, they all agreed, would be 
explosive: The United States would be denounced, the Fangs pilloried and the 
whole pro-democracy movement attacked as the work of foreign forces. The 
dangers of the situation were underlined when Chinese troops suddenly began 
firing automatic weapons in the street outside. 
</P>
<P>
"When all the talk was over," Link recalls, "Professor Fang turned to me and 
said that he felt they should not ask for refuge even if their lives were in 
danger. He said he wanted to do what was best for the movement." 
</P>
<P>
Fang, Li and their son spent the night at the nearby Jianguo Hotel, where a 
former classmate of Link offered the family the use of his room. About 11 p.m., 
their phone rang. "We are the two people you met this afternoon," a voice told 
Fang. "We would like to come and talk to you again in person." 
</P>
<P>
A short while later, there was a knock on the door, and two U. S. diplomats 
offered to escort the family in a bulletproof car back to the U.S. Embassy as 
the "personal" guests of President George Bush. Not knowing where else to find 
refuge for the next few obviously dangerous days, the Fangs reluctantly 
accepted the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
On June 7, despite the Fangs' hope for discretion, White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater announced to the world that Fang and Li had requested 
temporary refuge. And on June 8, at a press conference of his own, President 
Bush justified the U.S. action by saying that his Administration "had acted in 
compliance with international law, as an extraordinary measure for humanitarian 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Fang immediately wanted to leave the embassy. Hoping to get back to his 
family's apartment before the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged an official 
protest, he asked for a car. Li urged him to stay, and so did embassy 
officials, who were afraid for the Fangs' safety and concerned that if they 
were arrested it would look as though the United States had left them out in 
the cold. Fang finally relented. 
</P>
<P>
It was a difficult decision, he confesses. Fang was all too aware of the stigma 
that Chinese have traditionally attached to anyone seeking foreign protection. 
"I may have a reputation for viewing things from a modern perspective," he 
says, "but it is very difficult to say goodby to such traditional Chinese 
views. And I must admit that I am very Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
There was a quick and angry protest from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In 
language that pointedly mirrored Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on 
Diplomatic Relations, it charged the United States with "wanton interference in 
China's internal affairs" and "violation of both international law and the 
relevant laws of China." On June 12, a week after the Fangs entered the 
embassy, the Ministry of Public Security issued warrants for the arrest of Fang 
and Li, charging that they had engaged in "counterrevolutionary propaganda and 
instigation." Fang Zhe, unnamed in the charges, left the embassy for home. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media called Fang a "traitor" and denounced him as "scum"; Chinese 
television newscasters read letters, purportedly from angry citizens, accusing 
him of treachery. "His statements and actions have brought great suffering to 
the nation," claimed one. "If he is not sentenced, it will be difficult to calm 
popular indignation." 
</P>
<P>
Trapped inside the embassy, Fang and Li could do nothing but wait. 
</P>
<P>
GIVEN TO WEARING ZIP-UP jackets and nondescript trousers, Fang Lizhi is not the 
sort of person one would notice in a crowd. He is a short man with a shock of 
dark hair that falls over his brow toward owlish horn-rimmed glasses. He does 
have one flamboyant feature, however: a disarmingly whinnying laugh that 
immediately puts people at ease. At our first meeting, in 1987, he impressed me 
as an unpretentious, almost ordinary person. Indeed, until a year before, Fang 
was all but unknown outside China, except perhaps within the international 
world of astrophysics. But after losing his job and being expelled from the 
party following a round of 1986 democracy demonstrations, Fang quickly became 
famous among liberal students -- and infamous among party hard-liners -- for 
his outspokenness on the subjects of freedom and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
When we first talked, Fang was living in a Beijing apartment, provided by the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, with Li and Fang Zhe, then 19. His eldest son, 
Fang Ke, was in the United States, studying at Wayne State University in 
Detroit. Although Fang was allowed to go to and from the Beijing Astronomical 
Observatory, where he had been given a research position, he was forbidden to 
have contact with students or journalists or to travel without special 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
Fang Lizhi (pronounced Fong Lee-jir) was born in 1936, the son of a postal 
clerk, and he graduated from Beijing University at age 20 with straight A's and 
a degree in physics. His future wife was in the same department. After college, 
he went to work at China's Institute for Modern Research, but his career, like 
that of so many intellectuals, was interrupted when, in 1957, Mao Tse-tung 
launched his tectonic Anti-Rightist Campaign. Because Fang advocated academic 
freedom and refused to confess to ideological error, he was expelled from the 
party. But even after this rebuke, he remained a believer in China's socialist 
revolution. He told me during our first meeting, "I continued to have faith in 
Chairman Mao and to believe that it must have been I who was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
During the Cultural Revolution of the late '60s, Fang again ran afoul of party 
politics. By this time he was married and teaching in Beijing at the newly 
organized University of Science and Technology, China's MIT. After being 
incarcerated for a year, he was "sent down" to the countryside where, among 
other jobs, he was forced to work in a mine and on the railroad. During this 
rural exile, he had access to only one scientific book: Lev Landau's "Classical 
Theory of Fields." "For six months I did nothing but read this book over and 
over again," he told me. "It was this curious happenstance that caused me to 
switch from solid-state physics to cosmology." 
</P>
<P>
The treatment he received then finally began to unravel his belief in the 
Chinese Communist Party system. Witnessing the hardship and inhumanity around 
him, he says, convinced him that "the party was not telling the truth" and that 
he "should not believe them anymore." When the high tide of the Cultural 
Revolution began to ebb in the early '70s, the government, desperately in need 
of anyone with technical training, sent Fang to Anhui Province, where the 
University of Science and Technology had been moved. There, Fang was assailed 
anew, this time for espousing the big-bang theory of cosmology, which provoked 
attacks from hard-liners clinging religiously to Friedrich Engels' belief that 
the universe was infinite. Just as the Roman Catholic church had once vilified 
Galileo as a heretic, the party now began to look at Fang as a dangerous 
dissident. 
</P>
<P>
To Fang, the party's intrusions into science were witless and served to defeat 
China's modernization. His investigations into the origins of the universe 
required freedom of inquiry and expression, and he believed that the same 
conditions were fundamental to any kind of creative thinking or imaginative 
work. Through such party intercessions, Fang's strong disposition against any 
and all constraining orthodoxies began to take firm root. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until after 1977, when Deng Xiaoping was restored to power for the 
third time, that Fang was given back his party membership and a tenured 
teaching position at the University of Science and Technology. The next few 
years were scientifically fruitful ones for Fang. He wrote scores of scholarly 
papers, attended numerous international scientific conferences and had 
residencies at both the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in the United 
States and the Institute for Astronomy at Cambridge University in England. By 
the mid-1980s, Fang had also been appointed vice president of his university, 
where he rapidly acquired a reputation as an advocate of academic freedom and 
educational reform. He soon was much in demand as a speaker at other 
universities. In 1985, he told a gathering at Beijing University: "We Communist 
Party members should be open to different ways of thinking . . . for, if all 
thought is narrow and simplistic, creativity will die. . . . We must not be 
afraid to speak openly about these things. In fact, it is our duty to speak 
out." 
</P>
<P>
His call to intellectuals to throw off party domination by straightening out 
their "bent backs" stunned students with its boldness even in the relatively 
open political environment of 1986. What made Fang such a compelling speaker 
was not just his message but that he dared to speak so freely. In a society 
long accustomed to self-censorship and public silence, his speeches shocked 
party leaders as much as they electrified students. Party cadres in charge of 
"ideological work," who had become accustomed to controlling dissenters by 
threatening, firing, detaining and even imprisoning them, were nonplussed by 
the spectacle of Fang traipsing around the country like a circuit preacher, 
speaking his mind. 
</P>
<P>
That fall, he told a Tongji University gathering in Shanghai: "Speaking quite 
dispassionately, I have to judge this period (of socialist revolution) a 
failure . . . in essentially every aspect of economic and political life." He 
went on to deride the notion of waiting for democracy to be delivered from on 
high, telling his rapt audience that the concept of "loosening up" -- then 
fashionable among reformist circles -- really implied nothing more than the 
humiliating presumption that they were already "tied up tightly." He reminded 
students that democracy is "first and foremost a question of the rights of 
individuals and that individuals are the ones who must struggle for them." 
</P>
<P>
Students hand-copied transcripts of his talks and passed them from campus to 
campus. At one university after another, they flocked to hear him, laughing and 
cheering as he criticized high-ranking leaders by name. 
</P>
<P>
Late in 1986, when student demonstrations erupted at the University of Science 
and Technology and then spread across China, a furious Deng Xiaoping finally 
acted. Fang was fired and, along with well-known writers Liu Binyan and Wang 
Ruowang, was again expelled from the party. The authorities then transferred 
Fang to Beijing and put him under quasi-house arrest -- a move that backfired, 
for it not only gained him enormous publicity in China but also improved his 
access to the Beijing-based foreign press. 
</P>
<P>
Even though his activities were limited in Beijing, in January, 1989, he boldly 
sent Deng a handwritten letter calling on him to release Wei Jingsheng, a 
dissident who had been imprisoned since 1979, and to declare a general amnesty 
for all other political detainees and prisoners. Fang's letter provoked several 
petitions of support from other intellectuals in what became a prelude to the 
spring's historic Tien An Men Square demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, even though he still regarded science as the real measure of 
his success or failure, Fang was drawn into the political arena. Science, it 
seemed, compelled honesty, and honesty compelled political involvement. "I 
have, in fact, often just felt swirled into the middle of politics," Fang says 
now. "At the moment of each political involvement, I have been aware that I 
could have avoided it. But each time I did not want to go against what was in 
my heart -- what was right. And, as a result, each time I have ended up getting 
more deeply involved." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, Fang became embroiled in his biggest political brouhaha yet. 
Although the Fangs had been invited to the farewell banquet at the end of 
President Bush's official visit to Beijing, Chinese authorities prevented them 
from attending. Forced out of their car on the way to the party, Fang and Li 
were then hounded on foot by Chinese police through the streets of Beijing. 
Picked up several hours later by a friendly Canadian diplomat, Fang was taken 
to the White House press center, where he gave a tumultuous press conference. 
Soon his face was in newspapers and magazines and on television sets around the 
world. In several interviews, he suggested that the United States and President 
Bush applied a "double standard" in judging human-rights violations, treating 
the Soviet Union and China differently. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely because of his increasing notoriety, Fang shied away from direct 
involvement when the democracy movement erupted in Tian An Men Square that 
April. "From the beginning, authorities claimed that the movement had been 
started and was being controlled by a 'handful of rotten eggs,' and they hinted 
at the involvement of Fang Lizhi," he says now. "I was, of course, very much in 
favor of the movement, but in order not to give the government any pretext, and 
so that the movement could demonstrate that it was actually a mass spontaneous 
upwelling of intellectuals and students, I did not even go to the square." 
</P>
<P>
His absence from the square has been criticized as a failure to assume 
responsibilities he tacitly incurred. "I did not stay away from the square out 
of consideration for my own safe 
</P>
<P>
ty," Fang explains. "In fact, during that time I spoke every day with foreign 
journalists. If I had wanted to protect myself, I would certainly not have 
spoken out in this way." 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the protest, the party began a nationwide campaign to blame 
the democracy movement on a "very small group" of "plotters against socialism." 
After Fang and Li found sanctuary in the U. S. Embassy, they were accused of 
almost single-handedly starting a "rebellion in which numerous people died." 
</P>
<P>
But if the party overrated Fang's influence, so did many of the protest 
movement's supporters. Fang recalls how, on May 18, at the height of the 
demonstrations, a friend urged him to go immediately to the square, since he 
was "the only person who could control the movement." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I recognized that this was absurd," says Fang with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
IN OCTOBER, FOUR MONTHS AFTER the violent end of the Chinese democracy 
movement, I went to China in hopes of seeing Fang Lizhi. He was to receive the 
annual Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. The State Department, however, had 
warned the Kennedy family, donors of the award, that a public announcement and 
presentation could jeopardize delicate negotiations then in progress for the 
Fangs' release. The Kennedys wanted me to ascertain Fang's feelings about 
becoming the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
The night I arrived in Beijing, the phone rang in my room at the Palace Hotel, 
where I had been told to expect a call. An American voice, offering no 
salutation and giving no name, said: "I am waiting for you downstairs by the 
marble column just inside the front entrance of the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby, I spotted a figure in a dark suit standing alone near the 
designated column. As I approached, he reached out to shake my hand and then 
hastily turned and squired me through the revolving door into the chilly 
evening. Only when we were in a hutong, one of the dark alleys that surround 
the hotel, did he introduce himself as a Foreign Service officer assigned to 
look after the Fangs. 
</P>
<P>
He explained in great detail the concern embassy officials felt for the Fangs' 
safety, especially given the recent bloodshed. If the couple's whereabouts 
within the embassy -- three separate compounds several blocks apart -- became 
known, U. S. diplomats feared that the Chinese government might be tempted to 
seize them. The embassy, my interlocutor hastily added, would not be able to 
defend itself or to protect Fang under such circumstances. "Whether you will be 
able to actually see Fang, I cannot say," he concluded. "But please come to the 
embassy tomorrow morning at 10." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, I got up early to bicycle around the city. As I rode toward 
the Avenue of Eternal Peace, it was difficult to evoke those tumultuous days of 
spring, much less to imagine the atmosphere of terror that had led Fang and Li 
to the U. S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Just as in the past, clouds of bituminous morning smoke billowed up from behind 
the walls of old courtyard houses as people began to light fires for breakfast. 
The hutong were filled with the soft tinkling sound of bicycle bells and the 
familiar whirring of spinning wheels as people pedaled off to work. On the 
larger streets, the smell of frying youtiao wafted out from the stands of 
pastry vendors, suffusing the air with fleeting zones of special pungency. 
Children with backpacks made their way to school. And out on the large 
thoroughfares, those public buses that had not been overturned and burned as 
barricades during the demonstrations belched clouds of choking blue exhaust as 
they labored away, jampacked, from their stops. 
</P>
<P>
As I turned out into the heavy traffic of the Avenue of Eternal Peace, I felt 
as if a dynamo somewhere in Tian An Men Square had suddenly revved up, 
generating a powerful magnetic force that pulled me along. It was a feeling 
that I imagined countless thou sands of Chinese throughout the past century had 
also felt as they brought their protests toward this symbolic center of the 
capital and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, I found myself gliding past the Gate of Heavenly Peace, under 
the implacable gaze of Chairman Mao as he looked out from his renowned 
portrait. Around me spread nothing but a vast silence and emptiness. I had last 
been here in May when the square boiled with onlookers and demonstrators, all 
noisily debating politics, waving banners and roaring with a collective voice 
that was as loud as a cataract. Now, like a stage with a struck set, the square 
had been swept absolutely clean. It was so vacant, cold and quiet that it 
seemed the perfect extension of the ponderous Mao Tse-tung Memorial Mausoleum 
that had been erected at its south end to enshrine Chairman Mao's unnaturally 
waxy and rouged remains. 
</P>
<P>
The only pedestrians visible were armed martial-law troops wearing fatigues and 
steel helmets that looked like mixing bowls. They stood in rigid rows along the 
periphery of the square and guarded the enormous Monument to the People's 
Heroes, which had served as the command post of student protest. Out in front 
of the Great Hall of the People and the Revolutionary History Museum, I watched 
as phalanxes of soldiers practiced goose-stepping drills. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this sanitized public square, on the exact spot where the 
Goddess of Democracy had stood before it was crushed by a People's Liberation 
Army tank, there was now another sculpture. A party-ordered white 
plaster-of-Paris surrogate featuring a worker, a peasant, a soldier and an 
intellectual standing together in lifeless fraternal solidarity -- as if this 
soulless socialist icon could exorcise the square of all heretical influences. 
</P>
<P>
The reimposition of order in the square may have impressed China's hard-line 
leaders as a great triumph. But despite their efforts, a few telltale signs of 
what had happened still remained. In the middle of the Avenue of Eternal Peace, 
looking almost as if children had made angel-wing patterns in the snow, 
fan-shaped scars gouged by armored vehicles as they spun around that night to 
fire on China's citizenry were still etched in the asphalt. There were bullet 
holes in trees, buildings and walls. And the marble stairs leading up to the 
Monument to the People's Heroes, where tanks had tried to climb, were cracked 
and broken. 
</P>
<P>
And these were only surface scars. "Don't be fooled," a taxi driver had told me 
on the way in from the airport. "What has changed is not always easy to see 
when you just look around. What is different now is something inside people's 
hearts." 
</P>
<P>
THE U. S. EMBASSY COMPOUNDS, like Tian An Men Square, were also surrounded by 
cordons of People's Liberation Army soldiers armed with automatic weapons. As I 
walked through one gate, a soldier cocked his gun menacingly. These troops were 
a poignant reminder that the Chinese had not always scrupulously regarded the 
sacrosanct nature of diplomatic missions. In 1900, government-supported Boxers 
had laid a 100-day siege to foreign legations in Beijing. In 1927, a government 
under warlord Zhang Zuolin raided the Soviet Embassy, arrested the founder of 
the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao, who had sought asylum inside, and 
summarily executed him. Again in 1967, Red Guards invaded the British Mission 
and set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
In the embassy, officials again stressed that they feared that visits would put 
the Fangs at risk. All they really wanted to do was keep the Fangs physically 
safe and out of the press. Nothing, they stressed, was promised, but I was told 
to meet my original contact that night in front of the China International 
Trade and Investment Corp. building. At the appointed hour, I was picked up and 
taken to the American ambassador's residence a few blocks away. At the front 
gate, we succeeded in breezing past the soldiers and security guards. As we 
walked into the compound, I felt pulled by the same kind of powerful force I'd 
experienced near Tian An Men Square. It seemed to draw me through the dark. 
Soon, we were standing in a courtyard facing a single-story building that 
turned out to be the embassy clinic. As we entered a lightless room, my guide 
put a hand on my shoulder and led me to a closed door where he knocked out what 
seemed to be some kind of code. 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, the door opened. There before me, like apparitions, were Fang 
Lizhi and Li Shuxian. Now in the half-light of their hiding place, Fang looked 
much smaller than I remembered him. His hair was long, and his clothes were 
baggy and rumpled; he had the air of a hibernating animal just awakened from a 
brumal slumber. However, in his utterly characteristic way, he was smiling 
broadly. Li, looking somewhat grayer, stood beside him, grinning like the 
Cheshire cat. I was their first outside visitor in almost five months. 
</P>
<P>
Both seemed in amazingly good spirits considering their circumstances. The 
mock-apartment -- a few small rooms -- had been wired with an alarm system 
complete with emergency buttons beside each place where Fang and Li worked and 
slept. The windows had been covered so that no one could see in or out, and 
special doors had been hung to deaden sound. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit disconcerting to know that only a few yards away, there are PLA 
soldiers with automatic weapons," Fang confessed at one point, gesturing toward 
the outer wall. But then he laughed. "Nonetheless, we feel well and have been 
working hard." 
</P>
<P>
The first weeks of their hegira, especially the first few days, were the most 
tense and frightening, they told me. They had heard about Cardinal Joseph 
Midszenty, who had spent 15 years in the U. S. Embassy in Budapest, and about 
the group of Pentecostals confined for five years in Moscow. "We did not 
imagine that our time would be very short," Fang said. "But at the most, we 
thought we would have to stay until the older generation (of leaders) died. It 
couldn't be longer than that!" 
</P>
<P>
As we talked, I could not help thinking that there were few people better 
equipped for the rigors of such a monastic life than Fang Lizhi. As a 
theoretical astrophysicist and someone interested in history, culture and 
politics, he was possessed of precisely those intellectual resources that 
enable a person to put so much slack time to good use. 
</P>
<P>
It quickly became obvious that Fang had kept up-to-date on world events. We 
talked about the Chinese democracy movement in exile and the events that had 
been shaking Eastern Europe. He received foreign books, newspapers and 
magazines almost daily through the diplomatic mail from San Francisco. We also 
talked about the works of Hu Shi, a towering figure in non-communist Chinese 
intellectual history, who ultimately became China's ambassador to Washington. 
Hu had been a driving force behind China's first democracy movement, which 
started May 4, 1919, and had traveled to the United States to study philosophy 
and politics. There, he began to think and write about the ways in which he 
hoped democracy, human rights and scientific rationalism could merge with 
traditional culture to provide China with a future free from its old 
conservatism and the new dogmatism of Marxist orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a revelation to find that intelligent Chinese have written about all 
these subjects that I am now thinking about," Fang said with a self-deprecating 
laugh. "It was just our generation's misfortune not to have been able to read 
them earlier." 
</P>
<P>
And time and again, Fang talked about his own work. He lamented his lack of a 
computer and technical books that would enable him to perform certain complex 
computations more quickly. Still, he had finished three papers on astrophysics. 
They had little meaning for me as a layman, but they were clearly of great 
significance to him. They seemed to reassure him that his scientific persona 
would not be eclipsed by his reputation as a "dissident," a moniker that has 
not yet acquired the cachet in China that it now claims in Western societies. 
</P>
<P>
Since Fang had arrived at the embassy, he had been very reluctant to make 
public statements. But, from all he said that night, I gathered that he had not 
been overtly pressured by the U. S. government to remain silent. What seemed to 
constrain him was a desire not to impede negotiations with the Chinese 
government. But I also sensed a more subtle inhibiting factor at work. Like a 
typical Confucian gentleman, a junzi, he did not wish to be an improper guest 
or to give the appearance of abusing American hospitality. Nonetheless, when I 
mentioned the Kennedy award, Fang seemed pleased and immediately agreed to 
write an acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
What seemed truly to delight Fang was his growing collection of books, which he 
kept on a set of shelves beside his desk. He referred to them grandly as his 
"library." "So many people have been sending me books and periodicals," he said 
with obvious pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
The Fangs' most important possession, however, was a Chinese /English word 
processor, a machine that enabled Fang to write scientific articles, to work on 
his memoirs, to correspond with friends and colleagues. It allowed Li to 
compile a kind of alphabetical "Summa Theologica" of the names and addresses of 
the many people in China and around the world who were important to them. It 
was hardly accidental that their address books were among the few things they 
had grabbed as they left home. 
</P>
<P>
Myriad behind-the-scene details had to be taken care of in the embassy. Somehow 
the Fangs had to be outfitted with new clothing. This matter was solved with 
old-fashioned American ingenuity: namely, a Sears catalogue, a mail-order 
marvel that even produced the dark pin-striped suit Fang wore and the 
red-and-white polka-dot dress Li wore when they finally surfaced in London. 
What about vitamin deficiencies from lack of sunlight? A sunlamp would have to 
be flown in from Hong Kong. What about meals? A microwave oven was installed, 
allowing Li to cook dinner and Fang to cook lunch in what he called their 
"high-tech Chinese restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Everything that was brought in to them, including food, had to be apportioned 
into small amounts so that guards and staff members would notice nothing 
unusual. All garbage and waste paper had to be secretly removed from the clinic 
and disposed of elsewhere, no small feat considering the effluvia of a man 
given to reading as many newspapers as Fang. 
</P>
<P>
In this "black hole," as they humorously referred to their living quarters, 
Fang and Li existed in a world devoid of day and night. "I am," Fang remarked, 
"an astrophysicist who cannot see the stars." The Fangs attempted to keep their 
circadian rhythms in cycle by adopting a daily regimen. They arose each morning 
about 7:30, no matter what time they retired, and they ate at regular hours. 
Their main contact with the outside world was the arrival each day of the young 
diplomat assigned to them. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it was 11:30 p.m., long past the time I was expected to leave. We 
disarmed the alarm system and whispered goodby. Then I walked out the doorway 
that they would not pass through for eight more months. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, drawn more than ever toward Fang and Li's place of refuge, I rode 
my bicycle to the embassy once again. Some writer's impulse made me want to see 
it from the outside as well. As I pedaled past the gate on Guanghua Road and 
turned left onto Ritan Road, the compound seemed as vulnerable as a lifeboat in 
the middle of a vast ocean. Soldiers in battle gear were everywhere. And just 
as Fang had said, several of them stood no more than a wall away from the very 
place where he was doubtless sitting. 
</P>
<P>
ON NOV. 15, FANG LIZHI "received" the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. 
"What Andrei Sakharov was in Moscow," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy during the 
telecast ceremony, "Fang Lizhi became in Beijing." Lech Walesa memorialized 
Fang and the previous winners, saying, "They did not shrug their shoulders, 
they did not turn away, they did not cross the street when they saw another 
human being harmed." 
</P>
<P>
Fang's acceptance speech, which was read to the audience, was 
characteristically understated. "In this land of my birth," he wrote, "human 
dignity has once again been trampled upon." He admitted to feeling pessimistic 
about China's current situation. But, he said, even within such a "climate of 
terror . . . those who are most terrified are those who have just finished 
killing their fellow human beings." Urging students and other Chinese in exile 
not to discontinue their educations, he declared his undying belief in the 
"force of knowledge" as the best ally of nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
"In my field of modern cosmology, the first principle is called the 
Cosmological Principle," he concluded. "It states that the universe has no 
center, that it has the same properties throughout. Every place in the universe 
has, in this sense, equal rights. How, then, can the human race that has 
evolved in a universe of such fundamental equality fail to strive toward a 
society without violence and terror? And how then can we fail to try and build 
a world in which the rights due every human being from birth are respected?" 
</P>
<P>
By late fall, after Richard Nixon's October visit, the Chinese government had 
softened its position to the point where it became willing to consider 
releasing Fang and Li if they made public admissions of guilt. "Of course, we 
refused," Fang says. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the fall of Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, one of China's most 
stalwart socialist allies. The Chinese balked again. It was not until the 
anniversary of the June 4 massacre passed without incident that the Chinese 
position again relaxed. More and more party hard-liners, it seemed, had 
concluded that it was now in the interest of their country to resolve the 
bedeviling matter of Fang and Li so that important economic relations with the 
outside could be normalized again. Crucial, now, was finding a solution that 
gave them a way out without losing face. 
</P>
<P>
The second week in June, after President Bush recertified China's 
"most-favored-nation" trade status, officials at the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
unexpectedly invited Ambassador Lilley to dinner. The dinner presaged several 
more phone calls requesting additional meetings. When both sides got together, 
the Chinese asked to be reassured that President Bush had not written China off 
and that Washington would look favorably on concessions from Beijing. Once 
these assurances were given, negotiations took a businesslike turn. 
</P>
<P>
A month earlier, Fang had reported experiencing minor heart palpitations. 
Although there was no serious medical problem -- Fang himself later blamed his 
chest pains on "too much coffee" -- Lilley astutely raised the matter of Fang's 
"heart attack" in the negotiations. It gave the Chinese exactly the kind of 
face-saving excuse that they needed to reverse themselves and let Fang and Li 
go. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thinks made the Chinese authorities finally relent, Fang had a 
somewhat broader view: "I think it was all the pressure that they were feeling 
from the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiated deal required a public statement by Fang and Li. The complete 
text, however, was never published in China. It read in part: "I am opposed to 
the Four Cardinal Principles (i.e., adherence to the socialist road, to the 
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat, to the leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party and to Marxism- Leninism-Mao Tse-tung thought) that are 
contained in the preamble to the Chinese constitution, because their purpose is 
to uphold a political system of class struggle. I take note that the above 
political view violates this preamble of the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Highly selective editing allowed the Chinese government to claim that the 
Fangs' statement showed their "signs of repentance." It also used another part 
of the statement -- "we will appreciate and welcome all activities which accord 
with the progressive interests of Chinese society and moreover refuse to 
participate in all contrary activities whose motive lies in opposing China" -- 
to insinuate that Fang and Li had promised not to speak out against the 
government after they arrived abroad. In reality, the wording left them free to 
say or do anything they deemed to be in their country's interest. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any qualms, in retrospect, about the statement, Fang is curt. 
"We would not and did not accept conditions demanded by the Chinese government 
that we confess, repent and guarantee not to oppose them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If Fang is sensitive about appearances, so is the Chinese government. Lest 
anyone at home interpret the release of these two arch-criminals as a sign of 
Chinese weakness, Premier Li Peng was reported, in a paraphrase released by the 
New China News Agency, to have declared: "Due to growing political and economic 
stability in China, the Chinese government has taken a more lenient policy 
toward people who participated in the turmoil last year. These moves did not, 
however, result from pressure from the West." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the White House declared through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater that 
the Administration had made "no commitments, no promises and no quid pro quo of 
any kind" in gaining the Fangs' release. But Fang and Li were urged to yield on 
one important point. Counseled that choosing the United States as their first 
destination might inflame the Chinese government, they agreed to go to England, 
where Fang had been offered a position as a Royal Society Guest Professor at 
Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
While the Bush Administration may not have made any direct promises, it was 
obvious that the Chinese did expect specific returns. The Chinese were now 
looking ahead to the Group of Seven summit scheduled for July in Houston and 
the fall congressional vote on "most-favored-nation" status. When Japanese 
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced shortly thereafter that his country 
would resume its multibillion-dollar aid and trade program with China, the 
United States did not protest. Indeed, from the perspective of China's real 
interest, yielding on Fang and Li proved to be a cost-effective way for the 
leadership to remove one large symbolic obstacle between it and the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
FROM BEIJING, FANG AND LI flew to Alaska, where they were picked up by Air 
Force II and flown to a U. S. air base just outside Oxford. One journey had 
ended, but another was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, the phones began ringing so frequently at the Institute of 
Astronomy in Cambridge that the normally polite receptionist became distinctly 
surly. The fax machine burped forth reams of urgent requests for interviews 
from news organizations around the world. And camera crews staked out Fang's 
new office, hoping to get a glimpse of him if he dared to come to work, which 
he did not. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Fang spent the next 12 days avoiding the press. Although his son Fang 
Ke had flown in from Detroit to be reunited with his parents for the first time 
in 3 1/2 years, Fang Zhe was still back in Beijing. Twelve hours before the 
release of his parents, he had been detained by the Public Security Bureau "for 
his own protection." By delaying Fang Zhe's departure, the Chinese government 
cleverly succeeded in restraining his father from speaking out at precisely the 
time when world attention was most focused on what he had to say. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I saw the Fangs in England, they had begun to settle into a 
housekeeping apartment provided by the university, where they waited for news 
of Fang Zhe. They were once again living in a kind of seclusion. Fang's laugh, 
however, was as infectious as ever. Not once in the days that followed did I 
hear him complain about his situation or show any hint of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he faced a new environment, a new job and a host of unresolved 
questions. And I couldn't help but notice in him an uncharacteristic 
tentativeness. One of his most immediate burdens was figuring out what posture 
to take toward the overseas Chinese community. Many hoped that Fang would 
succeed where others had failed, that "China's Sakharov" could galvanize the 
disparate factions of the exile democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Fang Zhe arrived in England, Fang Lizhi agreed to sit down for his 
first formal print interview. About some matters he was perfectly clear. When I 
asked him if he now viewed Deng Xiaoping as a criminal, he replied without 
hesitation, "Yes, sure. Those who gave the order to kill bear the 
responsibility and should be brought to trial." And, although he expressed 
gratitude for all that the United States had done for him, he nonetheless 
criticized Bush's conciliatory China policy. "The stronger the pressure from 
without, the stronger the opposition from within," he said. "What I can tell 
you is that Deng Xiaoping is not a superman. When he meets someone who is 
stronger, he will give in. If you Americans will be strong, he will be afraid. 
</P>
<P>
"Take my own case as an example," he suggested. "Ten years ago, it could not 
have been solved this way. But finally the pressure exerted by international 
scientific circles had a real impact on the Chinese government's decision to 
make concessions." 
</P>
<P>
Discounting fears that China could be forced back into Maoist isolation, he 
pointed out that the country was now "much more integrated into the world than 
during the time of Mao." Consequently, he felt that the American response after 
June 4 could have been stronger. "At the very least, the U.S. could have 
criticized the massacre and China's policy of suppressing dissidents more 
publicly," he said. "The most important thing was to get the release of 
political prisoners. We have many lists, and Bush could have used partial 
sanctions coupled with conditions for lifting them to try to gain their 
release." 
</P>
<P>
"Your bodies may be big," he added, smiling, "but you also can be quite timid." 
</P>
<P>
After we talked all morning, we picnicked under a tree along the Cam as 
laughing students punted past on the river. Under a cloudless sky, with the 
orderly lawns of St. John's College stretching away before us, it was almost 
impossible to conjure up the bleakness of Beijing, much less Fang's dark hiding 
place in the U. S. Embassy clinic. These two contradictory worlds, which Fang 
had spanned in the space of a few days, seemed more like parts of a dream than 
a coherent life. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, when Fang talked about his situation and his new life, I could 
detect some indecisiveness. "I want to do something to affect the course of 
events in China," he told me. "I know that young people abroad are trying to 
figure out what to do next, and I too am puzzled by this question." 
</P>
<P>
Fang Lizhi in exile, he said, would be a scientist first, as he had been in 
China. "My major interest lies in science, and I think science is the best way 
for me to make the maximum contribution," he said. But then he added: "I'm not 
saying that this is the only way or that things won't change. Only that this is 
the best way for now." 
</P>
<P>
It was his desire, he said, to play a more spiritual than organizational role 
in the exile democracy movement. And he was obviously reluctant to allow 
himself to be seen as a savior. "I am not God, and I cannot pretend to be a 
person who knows everything and is able to do everything," he said 
emphatically. "If the Chinese are waiting for the appearance of a super-hero, I 
am not that man. Moreover, I think that this expectation is in itself an 
unhealthy one. . . . Chinese too easily tend to put all their hopes on the next 
leader, only to become disillusioned." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked him if he thought his departure from China was a victory or a 
failure, his attraction to politics became apparent. "It is a victory in the 
sense that the Chinese authorities finally had to let me go because they were 
under pressure," he said. "But it can also be seen as a failure because I have 
left my own country, and naturally my effectiveness will now be marked by 
this." And then, as if he did not wish to appear too gloomy, he recounted the 
successes of other exiled Chinese leaders, including Kang You-wei, Liang 
Chi-chao and Sun Yat-sen, all of whom had played a part from abroad in 
overthrowing China's last dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"In leaving China, the thing I am most concerned about is that there are so 
many people in prison," he continued, raising one area of concern in which he 
clearly hoped he could still have a positive impact. "This is the most urgent 
matter, one that I regard as my moral responsibility. . . . As to human rights 
activities, in these I will directly participate." 
</P>
<P>
Fang has never been the sort of man to take to the barricades. What China 
really needed, he told me, was to start absorbing modern ideas. "As Einstein 
put it, the pursuit of truth is more valuable than the possession of truth." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't such a strategy too passive to create change? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"To fill yourself actively with knowledge," he insisted, "is not a form of 
passive waiting." 
</P>
<P>
The pity of it is that because he is in exile, any role that Fang takes on now 
will have only a limited impact on the future of his country. He poignantly 
admitted as much. "Because I realize I can only really function in China," he 
told me, "if circumstances allow, I will immediately go back and make whatever 
contribution I can." 
</P>
<P>
IN THE FUTURE, ONE CAN imagine Fang Lizhi's being called to serve his country 
as Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel is serving his. But whether Fang 
would ever consent to be taken for public service from science, like 
Cincinnatus from the plow, is hard to say. He is both China's most eloquent 
dissident intellectual, deeply involved in the political dialogue of his 
country, and a dedicated astrophysicist, preoccupied with the misty reaches of 
cosmic time. 
</P>
<P>
Science is his foundation, and Fang seems wary of letting himself drift away 
from it. Some may find a certain ingenuousness in the tenacity with which he 
clings to academia and theoretical astrophysics when his country has so much at 
stake in the here and now. How can he shrink from the role of leader when 
suddenly he is set free and so many turn to him? they may well ask. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever people's expectations, Fang has never viewed, much less 
proclaimed, himself as the leader of an organized Chinese opposition. Each time 
he has come into prominence, he has appeared to be thrust into it more by 
circumstance than by any eagerness to capitalize on it for himself. Although he 
clearly is fascinated with politics, in a way that strikes one as almost 
Daoist, political attention has more often gravitated to Fang than he to it. In 
this era of megalomaniacs and publicity seekers, any such reserve in political 
figures is, in its cryptic way, both rare and reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
While some may see weakness and lack of political commitment in Fang's 
reticence, others will be heartened to discover a man who does not predictably 
lunge for political power; a man who, given the opportunity to write himself 
ever larger, cautiously continues to struggle not to lose himself, his 
intellectual foundation or his principles. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee that Fang Lizhi will not be extinguished and forgotten 
like so many other Chinese rebels who have momentarily streaked across the 
political sky. Still, restrained political ambition can emit its own special 
magnetic power, one that often ends up being far more persuasive than clamoring 
egos, reams of official propaganda and even the firepower of a People's 
Liberation Army.

NOSTRADAMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his review of "The Mask of Nostradamus" (Sept. 2), Malcolm Dean has, I 
believe, unfairly represented the contents and the claims of my book, which he 
lumps in with "dubious literature." 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to save the rapidly dwindling reputation of astrology, 
Mr. Dean devotes some 40% of his review not to my book but to a curious 
statistical finding of two French psychologists, a matter in which I was not 
"closely associated" as he chooses to state; I was not in any way involved with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Even Dean admits that the French finding does "not support modern astrological 
methods," and he might have added that it has nothing at all to do with 
astrology at any period of history, which is why I ignored it in my book. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot find where Mr. Dean obtained what he calls the "misleading and 
inaccurate" subtitle -- "The First Biography of Nostradamus" -- that he claims 
I used to describe my book. This invented reference appears nowhere in the 
book, on the jacket or in the advertising. In my bibliography, I list 12 
previous biographies, and there are many more. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere does the reviewer deny any of the damning evidence I have produced to 
show that Nostradamus was the Jeane Dixon of his day; that is, highly respected 
for no apparent reason. Instead, he makes unsupported accusations of purposeful 
omissions, prejudice and lack of scholarship on my part. 
</P>
<P>
I can have no objection to legitimate, properly derived criticism of my work, 
but this review, offered by one who is already admittedly dedicated to belief 
in cosmic influences, cannot go unchallenged. As someone designated by Mr. Dean 
to be a "tub-thumper," I have apparently thumped his personal tub rather 
soundly. It sounds quite empty.

NOSTRADAMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While it is generally acknowledged that an outsider reviewer's position may not 
represent a publication's editorial position, it is also true that a 
publication must share some responsibility for the merit or the failures of its 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Your reviewer, Malcolm Dean, is a believer in, or some kind of devotee of, 
astrology, and from that stance dismisses James Randi's "The Mask of 
Nostradamus." 
</P>
<P>
Characteristically of astrology's believers, Dean totally fails to address the 
substance of Randi's evidence of Nostradamus' fakery or indeed the actual 
content of his book. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at least one reader finds it alarming that one of the nation's largest 
daily papers indirectly lends support to belief in astrology, which all 
reputable scientific authorities have and continue to dismiss as nonsense. You 
would better serve your readers by now having Randi's book reviewed instead of 
its serving as a peg for Dean's polemics. Incidentally, Dean's antagonism to 
Randi is of long standing, so one questions the propriety of assigning the 
review to an avowed opponent.

SOUL-SEARCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hate to be a spoilsport; I really do. Moreover, I realize that I am an old 
fogey in an anti-traditionalist, deconstructionist, radicalized counterculture. 
</P>
<P>
However, the love of literature runs deep within my soul, and I cannot continue 
silent in the face of the total debasement of poetry within the pages of the 
L.A. Times Book Review. 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't your weekly selections exhibit some minimal poetic qualities? Is that 
really so much to ask? 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I'm not one of those Neanderthals who insist on the rhymes 
and rhythms that made lyrics lyrical over the past several thousand years. I 
can appreciate free verse as well as the next fellow, but I was under the 
impression that a writer who discards form is under some obligation to 
compensate on the side of content. 
</P>
<P>
Any institutionalized maniac is able to create chaos out of order, but is that 
art? Where is the condensation of meaning and feeling? The spiritual uplift? 
The fresh insight? The breath-catching surprise? 
</P>
<P>
Where in God's name is the beauty? Where in hell are your souls?

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM; FIRST AND FIFTH EDITIONS BY 
EDWARD FITZGERALD (DOVER: $1 EACH) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1859, the English gentleman and scholar Edward FitzGerald published his 
first translation of the quatrains attributed to the Persian mathematician, 
astronomer, philosopher and poet Omar Khayyam (1048-1122). FitzGerald spent the 
next decades reworking his translations: The fifth version was published 
posthumously in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
This edition of the two most famous translations is part of a new literary 
series from Dover that includes "The Call of the Wild" by Jack London, "The 
Importance of Being Ernest" by Oscar Wilde, Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" 
and Herman Melville's "Bartleby" and "Benito Cereno," each priced at just $1. 
Although the notes in the plain-wrap volumes are minimal, the bindings are 
sturdy and serviceable. These Thrift Editions return to the original notion of 
the paperback book as an inexpensive way to build a library of literary 
classics.

ENDPAPERS: OF BOOK REVIEWING AND BROTHERLY LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, Miles, on leave from Book Review as of Oct. 1, 1990, will 
continue to contribute to Endpapers during his absence. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem, "Brothers," a teacher, during the annual school 
play, watches a student, Henry, watch his younger brother, John, up on the 
stage. John, an "imp" and "brass-bold," is quite without stage fright: 
</P>
<P>
 He had no work to hold 
</P>
<P>
 His heart up at the strain; 
</P>
<P>
 Nay, roguish ran the vein. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger brothers are like that, sometimes. And sometimes it is the serious 
older brother, watching from the shadows, who dies a thousand deaths. Henry is 
clearly that kind of older brother. As for the teacher, he finds Henry a far 
better show than John. Watching Henry watch Jack is in fact quite literally 
enough to restore the teacher's faith in human nature. 
</P>
<P>
Taken on its own terms, "Brothers" is a lovely, touching poem, and yet I 
confess that I have, for years, taken this poem on special terms of my own. I 
am, yes, an older brother, with one younger brother a congenital daredevil and 
another a professional musician, but those are not the special terms. They are, 
essentially, the same terms and account for, at most, a susceptibility. 
</P>
<P>
The special terms are those, first, of book publishing and, second, of book 
reviewing. Book publishing can be a crass and bruising business. And yet during 
the 10 years I spent in it as an acquiring editor, I found it ever and again 
touched by the kind of secret love that Hopkins calls "tender byplay." For the 
"young dog," strutting his stuff merrily on stage, substitute an author. You 
can't be an author without a healthy ego, and you can't be an author's 
publisher if you can't bear the sight of ego on display. You have to believe 
that the display is indeed a sign of health and proceed to enjoy it. But this 
is just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
For the "heart-forsook" young spectator, substitute the reader, lifted out of 
his own life, his own mind, and lost for a time in another's. Publishers may be 
faulted for thinking too much of the market, too little of the intrinsic merits 
of the work, but imagine a market made up of real human beings, some of them as 
ardent and vulnerable as Henry, and the thought is redeemed. Finally, for the 
teacher watching the two boys, substitute the publisher. The teacher is 
undeceived about the quality of the play ("Two tedious acts were past"). His 
pleasure is not in the play but in the tender byplay -- in making it happen and 
then watching it happen. Sometimes, at least, the pleasure of book publishing 
is quite like this. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins' teacher, his narrator, knows that if there were no school, there would 
be no school play and no "love-laced" transaction between the two brothers, one 
on stage, the other off. The publisher knows that if there were no publishing 
house, there would be no book and no similar transaction between writer and 
reader. In either case, nature, "bad, base, and blind," would lose a rare 
chance to show herself unexpectedly and improbably kind. 
</P>
<P>
"Parasites," Ernest Hemingway called publishers, and we know what he meant. 
Publishers live off books they don't write. Who can deny it? Such pleasure as a 
publisher may take in an author's success stops, as often as not, at a 
merchant's pleasure in goods sold. My claim is simply that it doesn't always 
stop there. A publishing house, watching as the world responds to one of its 
authors, can forget money as completely as, in the last stanza of "Brothers," 
Hopkins' teacher has forgotten tuition payments. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly six years ago, when I stopped editing books for a book publisher and 
started editing book reviews for a newspaper, I missed those moments of 
collective, quasi-parental pride and joy. What I was to discover was a new kind 
of byplay. The acquiring editor in a book publishing house will know perhaps 20 
or 30 writers extremely well. He may know the texts of their works as no one 
but they themselves ever will. And yet the readers of those works will remain 
for the editor a large, undifferentiated mass (large if he's lucky, small 
otherwise). 
</P>
<P>
These proportions are reversed for the editor of book reviews. Now it is the 
authors, thousands of them, who remain strangers, while a select group of 
readers-in-public -- his regular reviewers -- become his collaborators and, in 
a way, his intimates. It is as if at Hopkins' school play, two teachers are in 
attendance, one watching the performance of the boy up on stage, the other 
monitoring the reactions of the boy down in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Two kinds of attention, two kinds of hope, two kinds of "tender byplay," but 
neither will be mine during the coming 12 months of my leave from the Book 
Review. I will write during the leave, and much more than I now do, but at this 
moment that change seems less profound than that I will have become for the 
year an ordinary reader. No longer engaged in either variety of readerly 
byplay, I will try to be again, and simply, at play. The Book Review byplay, 
meanwhile, is safe in the hands of the Book Review staff and Kenneth Turan as 
book editor. To them and to the faithful readers of this smallest section of 
The Times, my best wishes for a year, as Hopkins put it, of comfort and salt.

Brothers 
</P>
<P>
By Gerard Manley Hopkins 
</P>
<P>
How lovely the elder brother's 
</P>
<P>
Life all laced in the other's, 
</P>
<P>
Love-laced! -- what once I well 
</P>
<P>
Witnessed; so fortune fell. 
</P>
<P>
When Shrovetide, two years gone, 
</P>
<P>
Our boys' plays brought on 
</P>
<P>
Part was picked for John, 
</P>
<P>
Young John; then fear, then joy 
</P>
<P>
Ran revel in the elder boy. 
</P>
<P>
Their night was come now; all 
</P>
<P>
Our company thronged the hall; 
</P>
<P>
Henry, by the wall, 
</P>
<P>
Beckoned me beside him; 
</P>
<P>
I came where called, and eyed him 
</P>
<P>
By meanwhiles; making my play 
</P>
<P>
Turn most on tender byplay. 
</P>
<P>
For, wrung all on love's rack, 
</P>
<P>
My lad, and lost in Jack, 
</P>
<P>
Smiled, blushed, and bit his lip; 
</P>
<P>
Or drove, with a diver's dip, 
</P>
<P>
Clutched hands down through clasped knees -- 
</P>
<P>
Truth's tokens tricks like these, 
</P>
<P>
Old telltales, with what stress 
</P>
<P>
He hung on the imp's success. 
</P>
<P>
Now the other was brass-bold: 
</P>
<P>
He had no work to hold 
</P>
<P>
His heart up at the strain; 
</P>
<P>
Nay, roguish ran the vein. 
</P>
<P>
Two tedious acts were past; 
</P>
<P>
Jack's call and cue at last; 
</P>
<P>
When Henry, heart-forsook, 
</P>
<P>
Dropped eyes and dared not look. 
</P>
<P>
Eh, how all rung! 
</P>
<P>
Young dog, he did give tongue! 
</P>
<P>
But Harry -- in his hands he has flung 
</P>
<P>
His tear-tricked cheeks of flame 
</P>
<P>
For fond love and for shame. 
</P>
<P>
Ah Nature, framed in fault, 
</P>
<P>
There's comfort then, there's salt; 
</P>
<P>
Nature, bad, base, and blind, 
</P>
<P>
Dearly thou canst be kind; 
</P>
<P>
There dearly then, dearly, 
</P>
<P>
I'll cry thou canst be kind.

BLANK CHECK; THE PENTAGON'S BLACK BUDGET BY TIM WEINER (WARNER BOOKS: $21.95; 
272 PP.; 0446-51507-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Adelman, Ambassador Adelman, former director of the U.S. Arms 
Control Agency (1983-87) and assistant to the secretary of Defense (1975-77), 
is author of The Great Universal Embrace (Simon &amp; Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like some journalistic sorcerer's apprentice, Tim Weiner turns a perfectly 
sensible thesis -- that the Pentagon's secret spending has grown excessive -- 
into an excessive attack on the U.S. security apparatus, especially during the 
Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
That's too bad. For Weiner's eminently readable book, based on his Pulitzer 
Prize-winning series in the Philadelphia Inquirer, makes the sound point that 
the Defense Department's $36-billion "black budget," the budget hidden from 
normal public and Congressional view, has grown too big. Bigger than the 
federal government's budget for transportation or agriculture. Twice as big as 
that for the Department of Education. Bigger, in fact, than any country's 
military budget, except that of the Soviet Union. Weiner claims that it is 
growing faster than any section of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Especially apt is Weiner's criticism of the more than $5 billion in "previously 
public Pentagon programs" that went black between 1986 and 1989. And especially 
unsettling is his finding that in the current 1991 budget, "almost twenty-five 
cents of every dollar for Pentagon research is black." He raises valid legal 
questions in light of the Constitutional provision that "a regular Statement 
and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be 
published from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
But do such revelations warrant such hyperventilating? 
</P>
<P>
The book's shrill tone does not jibe with its serious thesis. Weiner forecasts 
the breathlessness in his Introduction: "I saw a world of secrets sealed 
beneath a steely cover. I wanted to pry the lid off the box, find a way inside 
and see the panorama sprawling within." And the publicity blurb hypes the book 
as "as riveting as any techno-thriller, but more frightening because it is 
based on fact." 
</P>
<P>
But is it? 
</P>
<P>
Weiner fingers the B-2 Stealth bomber, which he says "went through its research 
and development in complete secrecy" whereby "Congress couldn't debate it" and 
it "was invulnerable to informed criticism." True, the Stealth technology was 
shrouded and the bomber kept out of sight for years. But its existence was 
known from the time President Jimmy Carter flaunted it. While debate on Capitol 
Hill was muted, that was mainly because the Stealth bomber wasn't controversial 
until the remarkable turnabout in U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Few Congressional leaders, moreover, can feign surprise at its price, or its 
nature, for more than 170 senators and representatives and committee staffs 
were given access to the B-2 program after 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner huffs about the Reagan Administration seeking to tighten federal laws so 
that anyone caught publishing information on black programs could be "convicted 
of high treason. Upon conviction, such a traitor could be shot to death by a 
firing squad." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Weiner's fast-paced book, I kept wondering just how "black," secret 
and stealthy all these programs really are. After all, I sit there reading 
about them on page after page. After all, Weiner won a Pulitzer Prize after 
writing about them in his Inquirer series. 
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, Weiner's impressive investigative powers negate his intelligent 
thesis; little is indeed kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I support his call for greater openness. While he believes "The 
practice of black budgetry is a relic of the Cold War and should now come to an 
end," I believe that broad budget categories should be unblackened. 
Technologies and specific covert operations, run according to Congressional 
procedures, need to be hidden from public scrutiny -- but not big-ticket items 
like the overall CIA budget. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the CIA -- which Weiner does incessantly, despite the book's 
billing on "the Pentagon's black budget" -- I find the book's castigations 
antiquated and, again, excessive. Saying that the CIA "started out trying to 
save small, weak European nations from communism, and fared poorly. It found 
success overthrowing small, weak Third World governments in the name of 
democracy" is just not fair as a general summary of what the Agency has been 
doing for the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note, Weiner's case studies of the CIA's weapons supplies to 
Afghanistan, the U.S. Army's funding of a new paramilitary force, and the 
Iran-Contra fiasco make for interesting reading. 
</P>
<P>
And he makes a sound point when saying that "the conventional wisdom of nuclear 
strategy was dead wrong." For too long, the focus had been on the number of 
nuclear warheads, hardened silos and missiles. The procedures for possible use 
of nuclear weapons have, as Weiner points out, always been more important than 
their numbers, or even types. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner's wild words aside, his thesis deserves more serious, objective 
treatment. And I do subscribe to his thrust, quoted from Lord Acton, that 
"every thing secret degenerates."

GETTY TO SHOW LITTLE-KNOWN FILMS FOR PAUL STRAND CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Strand's photographs are so quiet and strong that they seem rooted to the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
This American photographer -- whose pictures are on display at the J. Paul 
Getty Museum in honor of his centennial year -- is celebrated for his strong 
sense of composition and for capturing images that convey a brooding 
emotionalism in their stillness. 
</P>
<P>
But Strand also made pictures move. Although far better known for his 
photographs, he was also involved with several movie projects. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of these rarely shown films are being screened at the Getty in 
connection with the current exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual shots in the films are composed very much like his still 
photographs," said Judith Keller, curator of the Strand exhibit. "There is very 
little action, but they are very, very beautiful to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Strand, who was born in New York City in 1890 and died in France in 1976, 
didn't just dabble in filmmaking as an artistic sideline. He made his living 
from it during one period in his life. In 1922, after making a short 
experimental film the previous year with painter Charles Sheeler, Strand began 
filming news and sports events, selling the footage to newsreel companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Some newsreel studio ended up with film of the Kentucky Derby and football 
games at Harvard by one of the world's greatest photographers," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1930s Strand's life and work shifted focus. He began taking trips 
to Taos, N.M., where he got to know a group of left-leaning, politically active 
artists, poets, playwrights and filmmakers. "He decided that as an artist, he, 
too, should take sides," Keller said. "He wanted to make a difference, take a 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, he traveled to Mexico, where he took a landmark series of photographs 
of people and religious icons. He also co-wrote, photographed and supervised 
"The Wave," an hourlong movie about a group of Mexican fisherman in Vera Cruz 
who organize to fight mistreatment by the boss of the fishing operation. 
</P>
<P>
"As a narrative film, it is not all that much of a success," said Michael 
Renov, the head of the critical studies division at the USC School of 
Cinema-Television. "But the photographic quality of the work is extremely 
striking. He used a lot of low- 
</P>
<P>
angle, heroic framing of people against natural backgrounds, in the manner of 
Eisenstein." 
</P>
<P>
"The Wave," which was directed by Fred Zinnemann, opened in New York in 1936 to 
mixed reviews, but Strand's cinematography received high marks. Strand joined a 
co-op of other filmmakers in New York and embarked on the most ambitious film 
project of his career, "Native Land," a complex 1 1/2-hour film about the labor 
movement in this country. 
</P>
<P>
It had a script by Ben Maddow (who now lives in Los Angeles and is best known 
for his writings about photographers), music by Marc Blitzstein and narration 
by the famed singer and actor Paul Robeson. 
</P>
<P>
"Native Land" took five years to make and was respectfully received by critics. 
But it was a victim of bad timing. "By the time it came out in 1942, we had 
entered the war and people were not much interested in the subject matter," 
Keller said. "People thought it might hurt the promotion of national unity, 
which was seen as necessary for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the communists refused to help with the promotion of the film." 
</P>
<P>
Strand again took on still photography projects, including a famous series of 
pictures he did in New England in 1944. In the 1950s, during the rise of 
McCarthyism, he left the United States and settled in Europe, where he took a 
series of pictures in Italy and Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
After "Native Land," he never again made a film. 
</P>
<P>
The Paul Strand film series will present "The Wave," with introductory comments 
by Michael Renov on Thursday. "Native Land," with commentary by Judith Keller, 
will show on Oct. 18. Both programs start at 7:30 p.m. in the Museum Auditorium 
of the J. Paul Getty Museum, 17985 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu. The programs 
are free, but reservations are required. For more information, call (213) 
458-2003.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: NEW PLAY ON HOMELESS HAS SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Street people sing -- and don't count on hearing any spoken words -- in Michael 
Kearns and Darien Martus' "Homeless," a 12-character contemporary urban opera, 
opening this weekend at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood. "The voices of the 
homeless have as much to say as anybody else," Martus said. "We not only give 
them a voice, we make them sing." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns conceived "Homeless" last year when he was touring his one-man show 
"intimacies" in San Francisco. He promptly took to the streets with Martus to 
research his subjects, who are represented here in a cross-section of age and 
ethnicity. "The plot develops around two women -- a young black runaway who's 
newly homeless -- and pregnant -- and a seasoned white trash hooker who's also 
pregnant," Martus said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the setting is dire, he promises neither a downer nor a civics lesson: 
"I approached it as an artist, not an activist. If it raises social 
consciousness, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
With "Homeless" on its feet, co-producers Martus and Kearns will head downtown 
to the Los Angeles Theatre Center, where Kearns' "more intimacies" opens 
Tuesday. (On Thursdays at the Theatre Center, Kearns will reprise his original 
"intimacies," in which he creates a poignant gallery of characters -- male and 
female -- who have contracted AIDS.) 
</P>
<P>
"The characters in 'more intimacies' are clearer, more focused; you get right 
to the heart of who these people are," said Martus, who has written the scores 
for both pieces. "Immediately I found the music in these people -- as I do with 
people in real life. Specifically, the music in 'more intimacies' is more 
acoustic, less electronic. There are no mikes, no echoes. I liked the immediacy 
of having the acoustic instruments creating sound right there." 
</P>
<P>
Also opening this month: 
</P>

Today: "Wake Up and Smell the Dead," a new comedy show out of Chicago featuring 
sketch comedy and live jazz, opens at Hollywood's Tamarind Theatre.

SOVIET AIDE VISITING IRAQ IS OPTIMISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ranking Soviet official left Baghdad on Saturday with words of cautious 
optimism that the Kuwait crisis can be solved short of war. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not pessimistic any longer towards the prospects of a political solution 
of the crisis," Yevgeny M. Primakov told Soviet reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov, a Middle East specialist and a member of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's policy-making Presidential Council, said that he was "greatly 
satisfied" with his two days of talks with President Saddam Hussein and other 
top Iraqi leaders. 
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the details of the talks, but his upbeat tone continued a 
recent pattern of Soviet comments on the confrontation over the Aug. 2 Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. In Washington on Friday, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, head of the 
Soviet general staff, told reporters, "I really exclude the possibility that 
Saddam Hussein would take on a fight with the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Iraqi officials are publicly holding to a hard line, declaring 
themselves prepared to talk with any party but ready for war and determined to 
hold on to annexed Kuwait and its oil riches. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Iraqi speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, 
delivered by Sabah Talat Kadrat, deputy head of Baghdad's U.N. mission, stuck 
firmly to Hussein's Aug. 12 proposals for a political solution, which called 
for a Western withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, international talks on the 
longstanding Palestinian and Lebanese problems and leaving the status of Kuwait 
for intra-Arab consultations. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov delivered a letter from Gorbachev to Hussein on Friday, but its 
contents were not disclosed and the reason for Soviet optimism was not clear. 
However, the Iraqi government chose the Primakov visit to signal Moscow that 
there would be no impediment to the withdrawal of 5,000 Soviet technicians and 
military advisers working here, the vast majority in the oil industry. An 
estimated 150 of the total are military men. 
</P>
<P>
According to Soviet journalists, Primakov was told that the Baghdad regime sees 
"no reason to hinder repatriation" of the workers. They said Hussein promised 
that a large number would be leaving soon. The Soviets are working here under 
government contracts, and Moscow officials have said they would leave as their 
contracts expire. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Baghdad, Primakov told reporters in Amman, Jordan, that his 
visit would continue a process of consultations. "I think it is necessary to 
find a political solution to prevent slipping into a military course," he said. 
"It is necessary to continue the talks held in Moscow by Mr. (Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Tarik) Aziz." 
</P>
<P>
The Aziz visit, four days before Gorbachev met President Bush in Helsinki in 
early September, delivered the unbending Iraqi line -- no withdrawal from 
Kuwait -- and failed to dissuade Moscow from joining the United States in 
pressing further economic sanctions, including the air embargo, against 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders, however, appear anxious to prevent the 
crisis from breaking into open war in the gulf, an explosive region too close 
to Soviet territory for comfort in Moscow. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said in his country's speech to the General Assembly that Moscow 
might send military forces to the gulf if the operation were mandated under 
U.N. auspices, but a potential Security Council resolution to bring the 
anti-Iraqi military forces under the U.N. umbrella has yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Most Western diplomats here insist that Hussein is attempting to manipulate the 
crisis by pushing what one called "a series of buttons," including the 
dribbling out of trapped foreign workers. Nine French citizens and four Germans 
left the country last week and the reported pledge to the Soviets removes any 
barriers to the largest contingent of Western and East European workers. 
</P>
<P>
"They can keep this up endlessly," said another diplomat. "They have hostages 
coming out their ears. . . . I consider these all to be cynical gestures." 
</P>
<P>
According to State Department figures, there are about 170 Americans trapped in 
Iraq: 101 detained as "special guests" and held at strategic locations as 
insurance against an American attack; 20 living in diplomatic "safe havens" 
here in Baghdad and about 50 diplomatic personnel withdrawn from the U.S. 
Embassy in Kuwait but prevented from leaving Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein continues to push other buttons in Baghdad's orchestrated campaign to 
draw attention away from what Washington and other Western capitals call the 
key issue, the invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Government pronouncements 
inveigh against the Western presence in Saudi Arabia, terming it an "occupation 
of Islam's holy mosques," and label Arab nations that support the Western 
squeeze on Baghdad as agents and lackeys of Washington and "colonialist 
Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's editorial in the English-language Baghdad Observer assailed 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the first Arab nation to commit troops to 
Saudi Arabia, as "the White House's No. 1 'Arab' man in the region." "Mubarak 
is now a mere paid figure who can do nothing other than propagating for Western 
and Israeli interests," the editorial asserted.

PUBLIC'S FURY RISES QUICKLY AS DOORS SLAM

<P>
By the busloads, tourists young and old from all over the country confronted a 
federal government out of business in the nation's capital on Saturday -- and 
plenty of them didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
"Where can I go to picket?" asked Jeff Runz, a visitor from Pottersville, N.J., 
as he stood outside the National Air and Space Museum, which stood closed in 
the face of the government shutdown resulting from the budget deadlock between 
Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to start a protest," Runz said, as his wife, Karen, and three 
children sat on the front steps of the nation's most popular museum. "This is 
so Mickey Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the glorious, summer-like day, many other visitors seemed to share in 
such sentiments as they found the art galleries, museums and shrines on the 
National Mall closed. 
</P>
<P>
"People are mad -- fighting mad, and I mean it," said Fred Peterson, a burly 
Smithsonian Institution guard who stood sentry in front of a darkened Hirshhorn 
Museum and Sculpture Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, taxpayers got a first, sour taste of government cutbacks and 
grumbled about what might close next after the long holiday weekend was over. 
</P>
<P>
The first to feel the pinch were tourists locked out of everything from the 
Statue of Liberty to the White House. But come Tuesday a whole range of federal 
services long taken for granted -- from weather prediction to border inspection 
and even air traffic control -- were in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
That uncertainty left many people fuming about what they called the cowardice 
and ineptness of the leaders they had elected to office. "The bottom line is: 
here we are saying to the Soviet Union that we have a better system . . . and 
we can't achieve fiscal responsibility at the government level," complained 
Daniel Yanosky, an accountant in Marietta, Ga. "That's pitiful." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and the 535 members of the House and Senate remained deadlocked 
over the outline of a tax and spending plan to run the government for the 
fiscal year that began Oct. 1. If the stalemate continues into Tuesday, when 
2.4 million federal employees across the country are due to return from the 
Columbus Day weekend, all but those considered "essential" would be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move could further incite public outrage, warned John N. Sturdivant, 
head of the American Federation of Government Employees. "If our people get 
sent home on Tuesday, we're going to tell them not to go home, but to go to the 
White House and protest," Sturdivant threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Denham, an assistant administrator at the Department of Health and Human 
Services regional office in Denver, said federal workers are bitter. "The 
feeling is that it's out of our hands, but we're being made to pay for it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Givens, a ranger at the 800,000-acre Big Bend National Park in Texas, 
agreed. "Morale here is very low," said Givens, part of a skeleton crew of park 
workers kept on only to tend to emergencies. "We've all got families to support 
and to be sent home without pay when we are physically able to work is very 
hard to accept. . . . This is really going to hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Aggravating public frustration was a sense that the pain would not be shared by 
those most responsible for creating it. "Tell (the President) to take the 
congressmen's limousines and the senator's limousines and make them drive their 
own cars," suggested a tourist in Atlanta, locked out of a national monument to 
Martin Luther King. " . . . They're giving (themselves) raises. That makes me 
mad." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, most tourists were clearly surprised to find the museums closed. 
And when they learned that the closings resulted from the White House-Congress 
stalemate over a new federal budget, many criticized all sides unstintingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Our government at work!" rasped Norman Benito, owner of a Santa Cruz mortuary. 
"Our representatives -- they should think more about the people." 
</P>
<P>
"We're fed up," said Michael Camporeale, a Mount Vernon, Pa., assistant 
scoutmaster who had hoped to take his 27 charges for a tour of the White House. 
"Can't we sweet-talk them?" Paul Grassi, 11, asked his leader, referring to the 
no-nonsense White House guards. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine it, the White House -- closed. It's really disappointing," said Anne 
Andrews, who was escorting a group of 23 senior citizens from Salem, Va. "It's 
terrible," added Lois Hurdle, one of the women in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Group members, bearing a letter from their congressman, had expected a VIP tour 
of the executive mansion. Instead, they clustered around Michael Mathews, their 
Insider Tour guide, on the sidewalk in front of the White House, straining to 
hear his talk. 
</P>
<P>
"You only get to see five rooms in there anyway," Mathews told them. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said White House layoffs, should they 
take effect, would slice the payroll from 383 workers to only 65, mostly 
guards, Secret Service agents and top policy staffers. Despite the cash crunch, 
however, Bush hinted that one apparently essential White House function might 
escape the budget ax: presidential campaign trips. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would cancel a Monday swing through North Carolina, Georgia 
and Florida to stump for Republicans, Bush told reporters: "I don't know. I've 
got to cancel everything that has to do with the government, I guess, but . . . 
maybe that's a good chance to get out there in the political process." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the impasse, it was business as usual for many government services that 
would normally be operating on weekends. But, blaming budget problems, the 
White House pulled the plug on its "comment line," possibly scuttling what had 
the potential to be a record talley of calls from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, that didn't go over very well on Capitol Hill, where members such 
as Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-Ohio) seemed to take umbrage at the implication that 
Congress might be to blame. "That's an outrage," she said on hearing of the 
shutdown. "It's time the President heard from the American people. Open the 
White House line -- override the veto." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who called one of dozens of park service facilities across the country 
got a recording, such as this one played in St. Louis: "The Gateway Arch and 
the Old Courthouse facilities are closed pending the approval of the federal 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
Still, air traffic controllers continued to direct a full schedule of planes 
across the nation's skies. And meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center 
in Miami promised that nothing would hinder their ability to track dangerous 
storms, such as Hurricane Klaus that was downgraded to a tropical storm 
Saturday after skittering across a wide swatch of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
There was confusion, though, about how these services might be affected later 
in the week. For example, as "essential" workers, air traffic controllers might 
be exempted from cutbacks. However, significant delays or cancellations of 
flights could still develop if the National Weather Service was forced to 
furlough some of its forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no one available to take surface weather observations, let's say 
at Orlando International Airport, then we can't make a terminal forecast, 
meaning no flights could go there," explained Paul Hebert, meteorologist in 
charge of the Weather Service office in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
So far, such a prospect doesn't appear to have deterred many travelers, said 
Dexter Koehl, a spokesman for Carlson Travel Cos., one of the nation's largest 
travel agencies. Koehl said airline ticket sales have remained fairly stable 
over the last few weeks, unaffected by widely reported talk of flight delays. 
Similarly, most air cargo services seemed to be planning a weekend of business 
as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a scattered range of federal services prepared to curtail operations 
over the next few days, even though some of the actions might seem to be 
self-defeating for a government starved for cash. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Federal Reserve system, which had scheduled a sale of 
three-month and six-month treasury bonds on Tuesday, will not hold the auction 
without a new budget, said Sandra Conlan, a spokeswoman for the Reserve's Los 
Angeles Branch.

HARSH WHITE HOUSE TACTICS CITED IN DEFEAT OF ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
REACTION: LAWMAKERS BLAME SUNUNU AND DARMAN FOR FUELING RESENTMENT THAT HELPED 
SINK THE MEASURE. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gasoline taxes and Medicare cuts may have dominated the debate when the House 
took up the bipartisan budget accord on Friday, but back in the cloakrooms, 
lawmakers are citing two other key reasons for the measure's defeat: 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman and John H. Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's budget director and the White House chief of staff, 
never noted for their congeniality inside the White House, appear to have 
angered lawmakers with their hardball tactics -- and set off a backfire that 
helped bring the accord down. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the recriminations in the wake of the budget deal's collapse, there is a 
widespread feeling on Capitol Hill that the President "has not been 
well-served" by Darman and Sununu -- particularly in the final hours of the 
budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
Even Republicans were bristling Saturday. Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.) rasped that 
the pair were "being referred to up here as Haldeman and Ehrlichman" -- a 
reference to President Richard M. Nixon's two top aides, H. R. Haldeman and 
John Ehrlichman, who drew similar reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) 
chastised so-called "unelected officials" in a speech during the budget debate 
on the House floor Thursday night -- a clear reference to Darman and Sununu -- 
he received a standing ovation from both sides of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
Administration insiders sought Saturday to play down the reported frictions. A 
senior White House official, who has not always seen eye-to-eye with Sununu, 
conspicuously avoided even discussing the issue Saturday. "I'm not going to 
dump on him," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
And House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), appearing on the Evans and Novak 
television program Saturday, was equally circumspect. "I don't have any 
problems in my personal relations with Mr. Darman, Gov. Sununu, and certainly 
not with the President," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to work with them and I think they've been sincere when they try to 
work with me," Foley said. "So, if anyone else has difficulties on a personal 
basis, they're going to have to express them -- I don't." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu and Darman could not be reached for comment. A senior White House 
official, defending the chief of staff, said: "It's become very vogue in 
Washington to become part of the Sununu lore. So people on occasion are taking 
an incident and embellishing it in order to become legend. A lot of that has 
gone on this past week." 
</P>
<P>
But the congressional reactions to them appear to track with incidents often 
reported by officials inside the Administration, where there are frequent 
complaints that the two can be haughty and condescending in their dealings with 
colleagues in other parts of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers' complaints abound: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Earlier in the week, Sununu alienated key GOP congressional members by 
threatening that if they did not support the President, then Bush would 
retaliate by visiting their districts during the congressional campaign, 
looking them in the eye and asking why they had not supported him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sununu not only made (voting for the budget package) a point of loyalty to the 
President, but patriotism and (Operation) Desert Shield," an angry Rep. Bill 
Thomas (R-Bakersfield) complained later. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During negotiations over what elements should be added to the budget 
package, Sununu kept insisting that Congress freeze Social Security benefit 
levels -- a move that was beyond what any of the lawmakers wanted to accept. He 
"had his own agenda," one onlooker said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Democrats say Sununu and Darman torpedoed the one deal that House leaders 
thought might have heightened the "equity" in the package -- a tradeoff 
involving capital gains. The two men supported the plan in principle, then 
later refused to approve specific numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Several lawmakers said they particularly resented the haughtiness and 
arrogance with which the Bush team negotiated -- particularly since neither man 
had ever run for federal office, a distinction that congressmen regard as 
especially important. 
</P>
<P>
How all this will affect the two current White House officials remains to be 
seen, but it's clear that -- for the foreseeable future -- their effectiveness 
on Capitol Hill has been blunted. "Darman was just too clever by half," a 
senior government strategist observed.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 
</P>
<P>
GARAMENDI, BANNISTER QUESTION OTHER'S INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the first and perhaps only televised debate of the insurance commissioner's 
race, Democrat John Garamendi promised to see that "every single Californian" 
has health insurance by the end of his first four-year term in office, and 
Republican Wes Bannister vowed to work for auto insurance premium decreases of 
35%, if elected. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong debate, taped Friday night, can be seen at noon today on KCBS-TV, 
Channel 2, in the Los Angeles area, and in other localities around the state at 
times to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
During the encounter, sponsored by the California League of Women Voters, 
Bannister and Garamendi accused each other of being aligned with special 
interests that derive income from the auto insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister charged that "Mr. Garamendi's major contributors right now are the 
trial lawyers, and if he is elected, I assure you that he will stay in the 
hands of the trial lawyers." Garamendi denied any such association. 
</P>
<P>
When Bannister, owner of a Huntington Beach insurance agency, called himself a 
"consumer advocate" and remarked, "I take care of my clients," the Democrat 
shot back: "Take care of your clients? Your pay comes from the insurance 
companies." He called Bannister an apologist for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi questioned remarks by Bannister that the insurance companies are 
justified in using the courts to fight the voter-approved insurance initiative, 
Proposition 103, and perhaps ought to be allowed a higher profit than the 11.2% 
annual return outgoing Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has promised 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have a tough time getting more out of me," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister repeatedly endorsed no-fault insurance as a means of cutting the 
lawyers out of the insurance income pie and providing the 35% premiums cuts he 
wants. Under no-fault, accident victims are automatically compensated by their 
own insurers and liability suits are strictly limited. Bannister also 
criticized state-run auto and health insurance systems such as those that exist 
in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi opposed no-fault insurance and said that under certain circumstances 
he would support state-run insurance in California. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the government has stepped in in the past to provide insurance where 
there was no private market," the Democratic candidate said. "One (such system) 
is presently being created in earthquake insurance (in California). . . . 
Nearly 50 years ago, a workmen's compensation system was put in place. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no private market for low-cost auto insurance, then it would be 
appropriate for the state to step in and provide it," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said that in New Jersey a government-run auto insurance system has 
gone bankrupt and the state is trying to get the private companies to bail it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi suggested that the state require employers to provide health 
insurance coverage and subsidize small businessmen who cannot afford to do so. 
Bannister said he opposes such plans. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates agreed that they would preserve certain features of the present 
territorial rating system in which auto premiums are priced according to place 
of residence. Although both said insurers may be using such ratings to excess, 
they agreed that rural Californians should pay less than city dwellers because 
accident claims are higher in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he felt the insurance companies had been acting in good faith in 
the ongoing battle over implementation of Proposition 103, Garamendi said, 
"Absolutely not." He promised to make the companies obey the landmark 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said the companies "have the rights of a free enterprise system" in 
trying to carry on their businesses as best they can. 
</P>
<P>
"My opponent is from the insurance industry," Garamendi declared. "We've seen a 
pattern over the last 50 years where people from the industry have gone into 
the Department of Insurance, become commissioner, taken care of the companies 
and then returned after a few years as commissioner to the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister responded that as an insurance agent he had consistently fought for 
consumers against the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi at many points in the debate lambasted the record of Gillespie, Gov. 
George Deukmejian's appointed insurance commissioner. Bannister said that while 
he did not agree with all her actions, he felt she had done a credible job 
under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
November's election for insurance commissioner is the state's first. The post 
was changed from an appointive to elective one under Proposition 103, adopted 
by the electorate in 1988.

FAMILY FEUD MAY BE BREWING IN MARCH FONG EU'S HOUSEHOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things may be getting a little dicey in the household of Secretary of State 
March Fong Eu. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Eu is not speaking to her son, Republican controller candidate Matt 
Fong. In fact, Eu has been advised by her campaign staff "to avoid any contact" 
with Fong, said Leo McElroy, the Sacramento consultant running Eu's reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The problem: A 10-second television spot being aired by Fong that includes a 
photograph of him and his mother -- an implied endorsement that Eu's campaign 
claims the four-term incumbent never authorized. 
</P>
<P>
Caught between party and family politics, Eu has maintained neutrality in the 
contest between her son and fellow Democratic incumbent Gray Davis. Eu's 
campaign hurriedly contacted Davis this week to assure him that Eu had nothing 
to do with the ad. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that she has to avoid any contact with (Fong) to avoid any 
appearance of collusion," McElroy said Friday. "Everybody has to be aware that 
there is no hanky-panky going on between the two campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Eu's campaign also notified the Fair Political Practices Commission of her role 
-- or lack of one -- in putting together the ad, McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Eu was described as "a little surprised" this week to see her photograph in the 
ad. Fong's campaign asked Eu's campaign for a photograph about a month ago, 
McElroy said, but the request was denied because "it would be inappropriate for 
a Democratic candidate to assist a Republican candidate" -- even when they are 
mother and son. 
</P>
<P>
But Gretchen Stockdale, Fong's press secretary, said Fong had told his mother 
about his plans and would not have used the photograph if she had objected. She 
said the ad features a personal photograph Fong had of the two of them. 
</P>
<P>
Stockdale acknowledged the spot is intended to capitalize on Fong's 
relationship with his mother, but she said it does not violate Eu's pledge of 
neutrality. It includes the voice-over, "A Tradition of Honesty, Competence and 
Commitment," while the photograph is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"He is saying that he is carrying this tradition down from his mother, who has 
been one of the most popular vote-getters in California history," Stockdale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stockdale said Eu and Fong "still maintain the same mother-and-son relationship 
that they always have," and that she doubts Eu would cut off all contact with 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood is thicker than party," she said.

TERM LIMITS NOT POPULAR TOPIC FOR FEINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein is the candidate of "change." It says so in her television 
ads. She says so in almost every speech. That is her main message. 
</P>
<P>
And it is true that as the race for governor speeds toward a Nov. 6 climax, 
Feinstein increasingly has been talking about changes she would make in such 
areas as education, crime and health care. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while campaigning before labor groups last week she repeatedly 
promised to sign a bill providing health insurance for California's 5 million 
uninsured workers "within 100 days" of taking office. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one "change" voters seem to be demanding that she cannot promise 
-- in fact, one she does not even care to talk about very much. That is a major 
shake-up of the political system in Sacramento, starting with term limits for 
legislators. She does not believe in term limits, the candidate will say if 
pressed, because they weaken a Legislature by destroying the opportunity to 
develop experienced leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like throwing out the baby with the bathwater," she said during a press 
conference in Montebello last Tuesday. "If people don't like an incumbent, they 
should vote against that incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's stand seemingly is at odds with most voters who, according to 
recent polls, favor two ballot propositions that would limit the terms of 
officeholders. Just as significant, Feinstein has been resisting the broader 
temptation to "run against Sacramento," a fat political target with its 
revealing FBI investigation, recent corruption convictions and incessant 
legislative gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, a close ally of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), is 
being careful not to alienate the legislators she hopes to deal with as 
governor. Aggressively attacking "Sacramento" and "special interests" -- words 
regarded by most lawmakers as euphemisms for themselves -- would risk "creating 
an atmosphere where they would go out of their way to see that I'd not be a 
successful governor," she said in an interview. "I'd like to create an 
atmosphere that addresses issues and where everybody is willing to work 
together." 
</P>
<P>
History shows that although beating up on Sacramento may be popular with 
voters, there inevitably is a price to pay for gubernatorial candidates who do 
it. "That's a mild understatement," said former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who 
pushed for political reform and enraged legislators when he ran for governor in 
1974, the first post-Watergate election. 
</P>
<P>
"Even to this date, it kind of sticks in their craw," Brown said of his first 
campaign. "There are a couple of senators who haven't spoken to me since. That 
was something not well received." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp paid the price literally earlier this year for 
proposing Proposition 131 -- a government ethics initiative with term limits -- 
and vowing to "drain the swamp" of political corruption in Sacramento. Angry 
legislative leaders used their leverage over bills to dry up Van de Kamp's 
campaign contributions from special interests, particularly trial lawyers who 
had supported him. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had commitments (from trial lawyers) but they (legislators) shut 
off the funds," said one former Van de Kamp adviser, who asked not to be 
identified. "They found a way to get to us and it cost us well into seven 
figures." 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is joining 
Feinstein in opposing Proposition 131. But his opposition is not based on term 
limits. He is opposed because the measure also would allow tax dollars to be 
used to help finance political campaigns. Wilson has not taken a position on 
the more stringent term limit measure, Proposition 140, sponsored by Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Taking whacks at the Legislature could gain the gubernatorial candidates a lot 
of points with voters, The Los Angeles Times Poll indicated in its most recent 
statewide survey. Voters disapproved of the Legislature's job performance by 2 
to 1. They also had a basically unfavorable impression of Speaker Brown. And 
they overwhelmingly backed the term limit initiatives, especially Schabarum's. 
</P>
<P>
But as with Feinstein, Wilson's criticism of Sacramento has been relatively 
mild, confined primarily to denouncing the "arrogance" of Democratic leaders 
for "gerrymandering" legislative districts and assailing liberals for burying 
crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't gone out of his way to say, 'We have to clean up the mess in 
Sacramento,' " said Wilson's press secretary, Bill Livingston. "He's not 
saying, 'Throw the bums out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's gentle scoldings of Sacramento have been aimed basically at the 
lame-duck Republican governor, George Deukmejian. There is gridlock in the 
capitol, she says, because of inertia in the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say the Legislature is faultless, let alone ethically pure, the 
former San Francisco mayor will acknowledge if asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That body has to come to grips with its own rules," she said. "That's the 
whole essence of ethics reform and I think it's beginning to happen. There have 
been some big and painful lessons learned. And with a new governor, there is an 
opportunity to set a new tone up there and that's what I hope to do."

U.S. BUILDUP NEARS END; CHENEY SAYS TROOPS FACE NO TIMETABLE

The planned U.S. buildup on the Arabian peninsula is virtually complete, but 
American forces still lack the firepower and supplies necessary to launch a 
successful ground offensive against Iraqi troops in Kuwait, according to 
military officials in Washington and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meanwhile, said in a television interview that 
U.S. forces will stay in the region as long as necessary, adding that there is 
no deadline or timetable for launching a possible attack. " 
</P>
<P>
The military officials said all of the heavy armor being shipped to Saudi 
Arabia should arrive by week's end, closing out the biggest phase of the 
two-month deployment and bringing to nearly 200,000 the number of American 
troops in the region. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of the progress of the buildup, Navy sources said that for the 
first time since the buildup began, significant numbers of cargo ships are 
returning to the United States from the Persian Gulf without orders to quickly 
reload and head back. 
</P>
<P>
One of these sources, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, said at 
least 11 ships were heading home without new orders to pick up Mideast-bound 
cargo. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about to pass the buildup phase and move into the sustainment phase," 
the Navy official said. "The heavy lifting is over." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon planners will consider the buildup essentially completed when the 
final armored units, on the way from Ft. Hood and Ft. Bliss in Texas, take up 
positions in the Saudi desert. 
</P>
<P>
But military officials noted that the U.S. forces, even with the final 
shipments of heavy armor, still would be well short of the manpower and weapons 
capabilities needed to mount a successful assault on the more than 400,000 
Iraqi troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
* The State Department warned Americans on Saturday to use caution in traveling 
to the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa and to avoid the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip because of increased tensions from the gulf crisis. It was the 
second time in a week that the State Department warned Americans against 
traveling in regions because of gulf tensions. 
</P>
<P>
* Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador to Amman, Jordan, diplomats said, 
because Jordan had recalled its ambassador to the kingdom last month after the 
Saudis expelled 20 Jordanian diplomats for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Italy pulled its two remaining diplomats out of its Kuwait embassy. 
</P>
<P>
* The British Foreign Office said a 46-year-old Scotsman has died in Kuwait 
after suffering an undisclosed illness. William Norrie Atack, a scientist, had 
worked in Kuwait for eight years as a scientific officer at the Ministry of 
Public Health, his family said.

<TEXT>
<P>
International relief officials Saturday proclaimed a virtual end to the 
two-month refugee crisis in Jordan while they begin to make plans for 
potentially larger numbers of refugees should war break out in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
There were still about 37,000 Asian refugees in well-ordered tent encampments 
in Jordan, but they are being moved out at the rate of about 7,000 a day, 
representatives of the U.N. Disaster Relief Office (UNDRO) said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 more migrants are expected to come overland to Jordan from Iraq 
and Kuwait in the coming weeks, but a multinational airlift under way from both 
Amman, the Jordanian capital, and the southern port city of Aqaba is expected 
to keep up with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
In all, almost 700,000 refugees have fled Kuwait and Iraq since the Iraqi 
invasion of the oil state on Aug. 2, officials here say. The scenes of 
desperate searches for food and shelter have all but disappeared from Jordan's 
desert horizon, to be replaced by an organized relief effort staged by numerous 
public and private groups. 
</P>
<P>
"If the present rate of arrivals, and the forecast of arrivals, is maintained 
and if the departure rate is stepped up, the exercise of evacuation would be 
over by the end of October," said Mohammed Essaafi, undersecretary of UNDRO. 
</P>
<P>
Essaafi cautioned that the orderly outflow depends on continued international 
financing of the refugee program. Money has been a source of friction between 
Jordan and relief agencies, with Jordan complaining that it has had to pay for 
land transportation through the country. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an outbreak of war would greatly increase the number of refugees, 
changing official calculations. 
</P>
<P>
"What I say today might not be true tomorrow, given the fluidity of the 
situation," Essaafi said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are meeting in Amman to work out plans for another massive exodus. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-affiliated World Food Program has stockpiled three months' supply of 
food in warehouses on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. The food is meant to 
feed 120,000 refugees and would be delivered to Jordan or other key exit points 
for the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Tents, drainage pipes, blankets and other needed materials are being collected 
in case more refugee camps have to be set up. Precise estimates of needs are 
difficult to come by and perhaps meaningless, given the potential numbers. A 
million Egyptians are working in Iraq along with hundreds of thousands of other 
Asian and Arab laborers. 
</P>
<P>
"If war begins, who knows what really can be done?" said an official from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"In war, maybe everyone will move, maybe no one will be able to." 
</P>
<P>
Winter is much on the minds of relief officials, who note that many of the 
tents set up to shelter refugees during the past eight weeks are inadequate for 
the winds and rain of the desert winter. "We are in the process of contingency 
planning against these enemies, but . . . there is no perfect protection 
against them," said Essaafi. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns seem far away from the relative tranquility at Azraq, a desert 
oasis town northeast of Amman where two large refugee camps have been 
established in the wake of the influx of Asian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
At Azraq I camp, about 12,000 Indian citizens were in various stages of transit 
Saturday. New arrivals bedded down under large green or pale blue tents. 
Refugees bused in over the past day or two lounged in the shade, took outdoor 
baths or cooked rice and lentils over gas-fueled stoves. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of evacuees preparing to leave Saturday lined up to board buses to take 
them to Amman's international airport for the last leg of the trip home. The 
average waiting time between arrival at Azraq and departure for the airport is 
about three days, refugees and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy with the conditions here," said Mohammed Abdul-Rahman, who 
reckoned that he would be boarding an airport bus late Saturday. Rahman left 
Kuwait three days ago, abandoning his job as a construction worker and leaving 
the equivalent of $30,000 in a Kuwaiti bank. The banks are closed in Kuwait 
and, in any case, Kuwaiti money has been been merged into Iraqi currency; if 
withdrawn, Rahman's money would be worth just $3,000 in Iraqi 
</P>
<P>
currency. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Iraqis are expelled soon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the refugees had heard tales of the difficult conditions experienced 
by many of their predecessors on the long trek across the Iraqi desert to 
Jordan. In the chaotic early weeks of the crisis, transportation, food and 
water were in short supply, and intense heat and bottlenecks at the border 
brought on illness and short tempers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like home in comparison," said Devendar Kumar Sinak, an Indian. "We 
have food and shelter and everything is clean." 
</P>
<P>
Sinak and other refugees who were interviewed reported that Kuwait was 
relatively quiet when they left. Some shooting was heard at night and Iraqi 
soldiers had set up checkpoints to inspect documents and search cars. The 
Indians said they had no trouble leaving by bus, although they had to pay the 
equivalent of $300 for the trip through Iraq to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of their countrymen, the Indians did not have to stay in Baghdad 
where, during the past month, Iraqis had detained traveling refugees in squalid 
makeshift camps without adequate supplies of food and clean water. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees who have fled Kuwait come from as far away as the Philippines, Sri 
Lanka and Pakistan. Besides Egyptians, workers from the Arab world include 
Syrians, Yemenis and Sudanese. All were attracted to Kuwait by a relative 
abundance of jobs and high wages. About two-thirds of the population of Kuwait 
were foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government and the United Nations are still at odds over payment 
for relief services. Jordan has complained that it has paid for land 
transportation within its boundaries at a time when the country's economy is 
suffering from reduced trade with Iraq. Jordan has reluctantly enforced the 
U.N. trade embargo on its neighboring country and ally. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next U.N. plan, whatever it is, we want Jordan to be taken care of 
first," said Salameh Hammad, an Interior Ministry official. Hammad wants 
international donations to flow directly to the Jordanian treasury instead of 
being disbursed through international relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign relief officials have complained that Jordan skimmed off some food 
supplies arriving from abroad and has imposed an airport tax on refugees as 
they left the country. For a time, Jordan also charged landing fees for 
international jetliners coming to pick up the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Essaafi, the U.N. relief official, appeared to recognize Jordan's plight 
Saturday, saying money will be found to finance ground transportation to take 
the burden off the Jordanian government.

Kuwait's exiled rulers have invited 450 prominent citizens of their occupied 
land to discuss a new type of Kuwait for the time when Iraq eventually 
retreats, the emirate's Crown Prince Saad al Abdullah al Sabah said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, Kuwait refuses to consider any negotiated compromise 
that does not involve Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from all Kuwaiti 
territory seized Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Saad, who is also prime minister, said Kuwaiti notables will meet in Jidda on 
Oct. 13 for three days to discuss the situation and make plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have this question in our minds, how to rebuild a new Kuwait," he said in 
an interview. "It will not be easy. We'll have to work very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was reluctant to elaborate, Saad made it clear that the meeting 
would consider issues ranging from defense arrangements to the basic rights of 
Kuwaiti citizens and foreign residents. 
</P>
<P>
"After the invasion, we learned many things as Kuwaitis," he said. "We'll have 
a new policy for security in the future, closer cooperation with our brothers 
in the gulf and with our friends." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Kuwait's dependence on foreign workers, with few rights or little 
attachment to the wealthy state, he said, "We will talk about all of these 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Invitations have been sent to exiled Kuwaitis, including present or past 
members of the elected legislature, senior diplomats, businessmen, judges, 
civil servants, journalists, students and others. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's displaced rulers are ensconced at the Al Hada Sheraton, perched 
dramatically on a mountaintop at Taif, the Saudi royal family's summer retreat 
east of Jidda. 
</P>
<P>
Princes, Cabinet ministers and officials while away their days in the 
seven-story hotel, contemplating lush gardens, sipping coffee and fruit juice 
and gathering at meal times for sumptuous spreads.

Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on 
Saturday for extra aid for countries that sent troops to defend his kingdom 
against Iraq, Kaifu's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to think of aid to Syria, Morocco, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other 
countries that are sending forces here," the spokesman quoted the king as 
telling Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu did not reply, but a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said Tokyo would 
consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has already pledged $2 billion toward the cost of the 300,000-member 
multinational force in the Persian Gulf, and another $2 billion to aid 
"front-line" states hard hit by economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu agreed with Fahd that Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, if unchecked, 
would allow the proliferation of a "dangerous principle that allowed strong 
states to swallow smaller ones," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fahd said he would wait "a little longer" for the economic blockade of Iraq to 
take effect. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu arrived in the Red Sea port of Jidda on Saturday on the fourth leg of a 
five-nation Middle East tour. He travels to the Omani city of Salalah today for 
a meeting with Sultan Kaboos ibn Said.

National Park Service Ranger Wayne Elliot was working at his desk in the rustic 
Ocracoke Island visitors' center Saturday morning when his supervisor called to 
tell him to shut down his portion of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore on 
North Carolina's Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Elliot did was to close the restrooms. Then he went to face 
campers at one of Ocracoke Island's 80 sites -- to tell them they had to roll 
up their tents and leave by noon today. 
</P>
<P>
The undramatic, almost haphazard way Elliot received his shutdown order is 
typical of the way government workers around the country are getting the word 
that they won't be coming to work because of the current budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just in the case of those who were scheduled to work over the 
Columbus Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
If the fiscal squeeze continues through Tuesday morning, the nation's 2.3 
million government employees (excluding postal workers, who are exempt) will 
face a notification procedure that more closely typifies the public's image of 
the federal bureaucracy: They've been ordered to report to work so they can be 
told to go home. 
</P>
<P>
As John N. Sturdivant, national president of the American Federation of 
Government Employees, concedes: "I keep meaning to ask why a person would go to 
the trouble to go to work only to be sent home." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, there's been far less preparation for the current virtually 
government-wide shutdown than there was last Monday, when the government was 
expecting limited automatic across-the-board spending cuts, as specified by the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Monday, they prepared us for it," said Karen Visscher, a financial 
analyst for a division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us so many memos describing what we should do if we are furloughed 
and told us how many hours we'd work," Visscher said. "We even had to sign a 
couple of papers saying we knew we'd be furloughed." 
</P>
<P>
But when an inquirer called early Saturday to ask how Visscher felt about the 
impending shutdown, Visscher was surprised to hear there even was one. The talk 
at her office had been basically that the "scare" was over. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden on Friday, people said we might not have to work on Tuesday; 
when people said the furloughs and cuts weren't going through, we thought they 
weren't going through for good," Visscher said. "We didn't think they were just 
going to put it off a week." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Gramm-Rudman cuts, which would have prompted only occasional 
furloughs of federal workers, the current shutdown only applies to 
"non-essential" employees -- a distinction that many here contend can be 
arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
"A nurse in a critical unit in a VA hospital will stay on because you can't 
shut off a (life-support) machine, for example," Sturdivant said. "The 
secretary to an agency head who does all his scheduling and planning might be 
much more critical and essential than an undersecretary in charge of planning 
programs." An "essential" national park employee "is anyone in the field 
providing life, health and safety," said Chuck Lundy, a Grand Canyon National 
Park management assistant. 
</P>
<P>
So, besides emergency medical services or ranger patrols to protect the 
visitors and land, water pump operators in the Grand Canyon also are judged 
essential -- because they maintain a water supply to the 2,000 year-round 
residents in the outer rim of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend workers -- particularly in national parks and forest service reserves 
-- were notified of the shutdown through an administrative grapevine. 
</P>
<P>
Washington handed down the notice to regional offices, which, in turn, called 
individual park superintendents, who then called division chiefs and finally, 
in most cases, the word arrived in offices such as Elliot's Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown is a haphazard affair regardless of any prearranged implementation 
plans, Lundy said. "There is a certain amount of confusion when this happens," 
he said. "A great deal of preparation goes into a shutdown." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the seemingly simple instructions that employees should report to work 
on Tuesday and then leave if necessary, the day will "be pretty chaotic," 
Sturdivant surmised. "Will the day be one continuous rush hour?" he asked.

<P>
President Bush does not like to lose -- nor look like a loser. And so, 
challenged by a recalcitrant Congress and surrounded by symbols of a government 
shutdown, he did his best Saturday to come out looking like a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, with the anger in his voice rising dramatically, the President 
-- who portrayed himself during the 1988 campaign as a Washington insider 
capable of working with Congress -- insisted he can no longer tolerate 
"business as usual" in dealing with the budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Working in front of a partially darkened White House, which sent home domestic 
workers and canceled public tours as part of the shutdown, with a chorus of 
senior White House officials standing to the side, the President delivered a 
performance worthy of, well, Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
With his voice rising in dramatic irritation, he declared: "I'm very sorry if 
people are inconvenienced, but I am not going to be a part of business as usual 
by the United States Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The average American knows what's going on. I think they know that the 
Congress has continued to kick this can down the road, and they think they 
ought to act," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
But even as he sought to focus the blame on Congress, the President presented 
the image of a leader ready to follow Harry S. Truman's advice that those who 
can't stand the heat should get out of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to take a little heat," Bush said. "You have to take some hits." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, he seemed to suggest, Congress should heed that advice, too. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these congressmen can jump up without any responsibility for running 
the country, or even cooperating with their leaders, and make a point that's 
very happy for the home folks," Bush said, referring to the pressure many 
lawmakers said they felt from voters concerned about increased Medicare costs 
or higher taxes on gasoline or home heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
Still, what the President faces is the worst domestic defeat of his presidency. 
It came early Friday, when the House resoundingly rejected a budget compromise 
blessed by the President after its intricate details were negotiated by 
congressional leaders and, for the White House, Chief of Staff John H. Sununu 
and Budget Director Richard G. Darman. 
</P>
<P>
The President met with the most senior members of the House and Senate for 
about an hour and a half Saturday morning, and told them he would veto any new 
measure to continue government funding for a week while a new attempt was made 
to resolve the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the President walked out the front door of the White House West 
Wing, where the Oval Office is situated, and told reporters that despite the 
protestations of the Democratic leaders, he would stick by his veto plan. 
</P>
<P>
While his talk was tough, it did not necessarily befit the man at the top, said 
presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, a Washington 
public policy and research organization. "To start posturing on this after he 
took a defeat is the opposite of presidential -- it's not George Bush at his 
finest hour," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's angry, and that's not always the best posture for a President," said 
Hess, whose association with the presidency goes back to his days as a member 
of Dwight D. Eisenhower's White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing a measure designed to keep the government functioning for another 
week, Hess said, Bush was demonstrating "a certain pettiness." He said the 
President had "set up a straw man" by, in effect, seeking to create the 
impression that he was the only person worried about running the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is, he and his minions bear a large share of 
responsibility for what happened. There is a little scapegoat-ism in that one," 
Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on Bush's get-tough 
approach, said that after the Administration lost the budget vote in the House 
early Friday, "the question was how to turn it around and get the ball back in 
Congress' court." 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Bush needed not only to send the veto back to Congress, but to do 
it with a quick and forceful display of presidential dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer we held it, the harder it would be to get that focus on Congress," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, this was to be a long weekend spent in Kennebunkport, Me., preparing 
the old family home for the winds and frosts of coastal Maine's winter. 
Instead, First Lady Barbara Bush headed home to Maine and the President 
remained in the White House, meeting in the morning with the Democratic and 
Republican leaders of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
But if he was unable to wear the winner's mantle in the morning, there was 
always the opportunity for a comeback of sorts in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And so, looking for a challenge -- if not an easy mark -- he summoned his stout 
but speedy press secretary, Fitzwater, half an hour after the veto message was 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation had nothing to do with Congress or the closed government. 
Budget or none, the presidential tennis court remained open, the President 
reminded his press secretary -- said to be considerably more able with a 
racquet than his physique would suggest. Could he find a partner to take on 
Bush and his brother John? 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater was confident he could find a doubles partner. When last seen by 
reporters he was dashing off to get his racket and shoes after grumbling to the 
President: "We'd lose to you and John." 
</P>
<P>
The tennis match couldn't have turned out better for the President. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed us," Fitzwater said.

President Bush wanted to veto Congress' stopgap money bill Saturday to 
underscore his determination to shut down the government until a 
deficit-reduction deal was done, but he apparently had trouble finding someone 
to type up the veto message. 
</P>
<P>
It seems the "non-essential" clerical staff had been sent home already. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, many of the offices were dark and tourists with tickets for 
tours were left standing on the sidewalk as the impact of the budget breakdown 
was felt. 
</P>
<P>
When Bush made an unusual appearance at the White House driveway to announce 
his rejection of the continuing resolution, he said he hadn't actually vetoed 
it yet. "Need a typewriter in there to get it done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, his personal secretary, Patricia Presock, could be seen typing 
frantically at her desk just outside the Oval Office.

A national debate on the historic role of V. I. Lenin was brought into the 
streets of Kiev on Saturday, with rival rallies praising and denouncing the 
founder of the Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 elderly war veterans waving Soviet flags and hammer-and-sickle 
insignia marched past monuments celebrating Lenin in the capital of the Soviet 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the city's largest statue to the Bolshevik chief, about 10,000 
people gathered in silence under blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags at an 
encampment set up by students. Many jeered as the pro-Soviet marchers passed. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine, the second-largest Soviet republic, has been the focus of much of 
the debate on how the country should now view Lenin, for years revered as the 
infallible architect of modern socialism in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Rallies for and against him have been staged in various cities, and fierce 
arguments have raged over whether to dismantle monuments associated with his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
The outspoken weekly Moscow News, in a telling example of the new tide against 
Lenin, reported last week that half the inhabitants of Leningrad want the city 
to revert to its former name of St. Petersburg or Petrograd.

A SLIMMED-DOWN NATO TAKING SHAPE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: GEN. GALVIN SAYS IT IS TIME TO DISCARD ALLIANCE'S OLDEST AND MOST 
HALLOWED CONCEPTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ST. AUGUSTIN, Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While European leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization grope for a 
new strategy in the post-Cold War period, the alliance's military commander, 
Gen. John R. Galvin, is providing some guidelines for such a doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent seminar of diplomats, soldiers and academics at the Konrad Adenauer 
Foundation in this Bonn suburb, Galvin spelled out his vision of a new, 
slimmed-down NATO force for the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The white-haired, four-star U.S. general indicated that some of NATO's oldest 
and most hallowed concepts, having served their purpose, are on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
These include "flexible response," which envisioned possible early use of 
tactical nuclear weapons, if needed, against a Soviet mass attack; and "forward 
defense," which called for positioning troops as far east as possible in what 
used to be West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Galvin said he believes that NATO's nuclear deterrent will suffice with a 
"greatly reduced stockpile" because there will be a much longer "nuclear 
threshold," particularly after new conventional arms cuts in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And "forward defense," previously insisted upon by West Germans because of 
domestic political considerations, will no longer be needed because of the 
buffer zone created by changing political conditions in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
While the new doctrine has not yet been agreed upon by NATO's 16 member nations 
or even formulated by its planners, Galvin suggested that an educated guess 
indicates much of what the new strategy will be. The main changes include: 
</P>
<P>
* Greatly reducing troop strength in Europe among all allies, particularly 
those stationed in Germany, possibly cutting U.S. forces in Germany to a single 
corps of ground troops, with backup logistic and air support. 
</P>
<P>
* Developing a more mobile force among the thinned-out units in order to cover 
the same area. This would mean troops would not be stationed right up against 
the German-Polish border but in a more central location. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the number of headquarters units, though Galvin said such command 
and control elements are an essential component of the integrated military 
structure of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
* Placing only limited reliance on short-range, battlefield nuclear weapons, 
possibly phasing them out almost entirely eventually. 
</P>
<P>
* Bringing in chemical weapons only in case of an emergency buildup by a 
potential enemy force. 
</P>
<P>
* Cutting large-scale maneuvers and low-flying training missions by jet 
fighters to a minimum in order to spare the citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
* Forming more multinational units, even though, because of differing languages 
and equipment, their value remains to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
* Emphasizing further arms cuts that could be negotiated between NATO and the 
Soviet Union, with NATO continually adapting its tactics to such reductions. 
</P>
<P>
However, Galvin, who has held his post for more than three years, emphasized to 
questioning Germans that this is no time to consider dismantling NATO, which, 
he said, has served its members well for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for NATO's integrated military structure," he said, 
indicating that such a system is unique in the post-World War II world. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that the current crisis in the Persian Gulf has focused 
military and public attention, particularly in the United States, outside the 
borders of NATO members. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he noted, some critics have said that NATO members should 
have provided more forces for service in the gulf region. Galvin said that 
after the crisis is over, NATO members will discuss whether the alliance should 
consider out-of-area action when the vital interests of its members are 
involved.

REPORTS PUT CONTRIBUTIONS TO FEINSTEIN AT $10.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic candidate for governor Dianne Feinstein raised more than $4.9 
million in the three months ending Sept. 30, bringing her total intake this 
year to more than $10.7 million, according to financial reports released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The reports indicate Feinstein had a relatively paltry $686,733 remaining in 
the bank by Sept. 30 for the final general election push, which on its face 
would put Feinstein well behind her Republican opponent Pete Wilson, who had 
$3.3 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the number is deceiving. It does not include an estimated $2 million 
expected to be raised by Feinstein in major fund-raisers last week and this 
week. Nor does it include another $2 million she is expected to raise because 
of a federal judge's decision to void California's $1,000-per-person campaign 
financing limits. 
</P>
<P>
The financial figures were included in reports each political campaign was 
required to file with the secretary of state's office by midnight Friday. Each 
covered the period beginning July 1 and ending Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was able to raise bulk donations for three days between the decision 
to lift financing restrictions and the end of the filing period. Campaign 
officials said the impact of that window of opportunity was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
According to the new figures, Feinstein out-raised Wilson in the just-concluded 
filing period, $4.9 million to $4.5 million. But he outspent her, nearly $5.2 
million to $4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the $10.7 million raised by Feinstein since the beginning of the year 
outpaced on paper the $8.8 million raised by Wilson. But nearly $3 million of 
Feinstein's contributions came in the form of loans to the campaign from 
Feinstein and her husband, investment banker Richard C. Blum. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also entered the year with millions in the bank, giving him an added 
advantage. While on paper he has raised less than Feinstein, the two candidates 
have spent almost the same amount of money. Feinstein has spent $10.4 million 
to Wilson's $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein began collecting bulk donations after the campaign financing 
restrictions, known as Prop. 73, were lifted. But Wilson has declined to do so. 
An aide said Friday that the senator is awaiting a review of the law by U.S. 
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist before making his move. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates, who are running neck-and-neck in polls as they head into 
the final month of the campaign, will meet today in a debate to be televised 
statewide. Locally, the debate can be seen at 6 p.m. on KNBC-TV, one of the 
debate sponsors, and on other local stations. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein received a pre-debate boost Saturday from the California League of 
Conservation Voters, which offered her its endorsement. Feinstein earlier had 
received the backing of the state's largest environmental group, the Sierra 
Club.

3 KILLED, 1 INJURED IN CRASH ON PASADENA FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Southland residents were killed early Saturday when their car veered off 
the southbound Pasadena Freeway and struck a tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Driver Juvy Angel Malit, 20, of Carson was killed, along with passengers Alden 
Villacorte, 20, of Los Angeles and Cyndy Lyn Balauag, 22, of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The three were pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, which occurred at 
3:15 a.m. north of the Golden State Freeway, said Officer Richard Perez of the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the accident said the car was traveling about 70 m.p.h. in the 
fast lane, swerved into the number 3 lane and sideswiped another car, forcing 
that car to hit a three-foot-high concrete wall. The driver, Maria C. Peynado 
of Lakewood, suffered minor injuries, and three passengers in her car were 
unhurt, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was closed between the Golden State Freeway and Avenue 26 until 9:30 
a.m. Perez said the cause of the accident was still under investigation.

CITY MAY TRASH BUSY BUT NOISY RECYCLING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judy Handler pulled her white Chrysler convertible to a stop at the recycling 
center on Crenshaw Boulevard in Rolling Hills Estates and quickly went about 
the business of unloading the bundles of old newspapers and empty bottles she 
had crammed in the car's trunk and back seat. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a saving grace," the Palos Verdes Estates resident said, 
explaining that she has been recycling at the center for five years. Her city 
soon will begin a curbside recycling program, however. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, a bare-chested Bill Cooke of Rolling Hills reached the 
front of the line and quickly unloaded his trash. Unlike other centers that 
require you to sort your garbage like laundry before they will take it, he said 
the center in Rolling Hills Estates is not fussy. 
</P>
<P>
"They do it all for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For two decades, the venerable recycling center has operated next door to the 
municipal horse stables and a stone's throw from City Hall. Open four days a 
week, it has become a local institution of sorts, visited by people living in 
the four peninsula cities as well as in numerous neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
The center is not so popular with about two dozen nearby homeowners, who for 
years have complained about the noise and dust generated by the center. Because 
of the complaints, Rolling Hills Estates city officials will hold a public 
hearing at 8:30 Tuesday night to determine whether to revoke the center's 
permit to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"We have complained about every three years over the past 15 years, and 
whenever we have complained they have done something about" the noise or dust, 
said Rolling Hills Estates Councilman Peter Weber, who lives next to the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't take too long . . . and it's back to where it was before," he 
said. "Finally, we have said enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the county sanitation districts, the agency that operates the 
center, say they have taken numerous steps to minimize noise and dust and to 
deal with neighbors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The center, on half an acre of a landfill closed by the county in 1980, was 
founded by a local chapter of the American Assn. of University Women in 1970 to 
raise money for various charities. The group ran the center for six years using 
only volunteers before asking the sanitation districts to take it over. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, 160 vehicles come to the center each day, Wednesdays through 
Fridays. On Saturday, the number increases to about 200. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took a record of 206 cars about three weeks ago," center worker Victor 
Prado said the other day with a trace of pride in his voice. "Cars were backed 
up for three hours." 
</P>
<P>
Bill George, recycling coordinator for the sanitation districts, said the 
center operates on a break-even basis. Since 1977, it has bought more than 
1,000 tons of aluminum cans and 2,300 tons of glass. It has also purchased 
25,000 tons of newspapers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, has translated into $1.7 million being paid out to customers or 
to 80 charities, as well as to organizations such as the Boy Scouts, the League 
of Women Voters or private schools. Last year, about $45,000 to $50,000 was 
given to charity by customers, who simply tell the center's cashier which 
charity should receive their donation. 
</P>
<P>
Center workers said they have tried to respond to the homeowners' complaints. 
Last year, for instance, a noise consultant was hired and a 15-foot wall was 
erected in front of the giant dumpsters where glass bottles are stored. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, center workers routinely water down the dirt road leading into 
the center off Crenshaw in order to minimize dust. And the mechanical device 
that crushes cans has been enclosed to reduce noise. 
</P>
<P>
"'I am sure we are not perfect, but I think we are as unobtrusive as can be," 
George said. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors' complaints prompted the center to apply last year for a $79,000 
grant from the state Department of Conservation to move the operation farther 
north to another part of the landfill. However, the department turned down the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a passing score, but there were other programs they deemed more 
important," George said. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners concede that efforts by the center to cut down noise have been 
a partial success. "It isn't as bad as it used to be, frankly," said Norm Unis, 
president of the 28-member Roanwood Homeowners Assn. "They have worked on it." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Unis and others contend that the center still creates too much 
dust and noise. When they are outdoors, they complain, the sounds of crashing 
bottles is particularly irksome. The closest home to the center is about 75 
yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of noise I (put up with) when I am in my yard by my pool 
entertaining people," said Vincent DiFiore, whose home is about 80 yards from 
the center. ". . . It is almost galling to me to know this operation is going, 
and it is so close to me." 
</P>
<P>
Unis and others said that homeowners were once promised by the city and the 
sanitation districts that the center would be relocated if it became 
successful. They also contend that since Rolling Hills Estates began its own 
curbside recycling program last spring, the center is no longer needed. Rancho 
Palos Verdes also has a recycling program, and the Palos Verdes Estates' 
program starts next month. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Weber contends that the center will eventually have to shut down or 
move anyway because the county plans to use the site -- along with adjacent 
acreage once used for the landfill -- for a golf course. State water quality 
officials are presently investigating whether a golf course can be built on the 
land without contaminating underground water tables, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weber, who has lived in the Roanwood area for more than 20 years and is 
enthusiastic about the golf course, predicted that there will be enough support 
on the council to revoke the center's permit. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is it is going to be gone next Tuesday," he said.

FAMILY SEEKS TO STOP PLEA BARGAIN FOR BAR BOUNCER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: PROSECUTORS PLAN TO OFFER ERIC CHARLES MEYER A PLEA OF VOLUNTARY 
MANSLAUGHTER INSTEAD OF MURDER. THE FAMILY OF THE MAN KILLED AT PANCHO &amp; 
WONG'S IN REDONDO BEACH WILL TRY TO THWART THE PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
The family of a man who was fatally injured last month in an altercation with a 
bouncer in a Redondo Beach bar has launched a campaign against a plea bargain 
to be offered on Tuesday to the bouncer, who has been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Charles Meyer, who pleaded not guilty to the murder charge, will be 
offered a plea to voluntary manslaughter, which would carry a term of 16 years, 
making him eligible for parole in about half that time. The maximum penalty on 
a second-degree murder charge is 15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
"There has got to be some way the justice system can help us," said Betsie 
Alvey of Harbor City, whose husband, Michael, suffered massive head injuries 
when Meyer ejected him from Pancho &amp; Wong's bar Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Alvey died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center three days after the run-in without 
regaining consciousness. Meyer, 32, of Torrance, had been scheduled for a 
preliminary hearing Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Gilbert Garcetti, who heads the Torrance branch, said 
prosecutors have instead decided to allow Meyer -- whose criminal record 
includes convictions for robbery and making telephone threats -- to plead 
guilty to voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be admitting his prior conviction and he has agreed to plea to the 
high term, which is 16 years," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcetti said the charge of voluntary manslaughter is appropriate for the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot prove second-degree murder. The facts do not establish second-degree 
murder in our opinion," Garcetti said. "You have a bouncer who perhaps is a 
little too quick to take action and maybe a little too strong and aggressive 
dragging someone else, basically in a choke hold, and then throwing him down 
two or three stairs, and he hits his head on one of the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that conduct rises to the level of murder." 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach Police Lt. John Nelson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a manslaughter case, and I think we all knew it going in," said 
Nelson, who supervises the detectives assigned to Alvey's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at the realities of cases and realize where they're going to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer's public defender, Lourdes Cawdile, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Alvey's parents, Patricia and David Alvey of Carson, said they, too, had been 
notified of the offer and were as outraged as Alvey's widow. With his death, 
Michael Alvey left behind three small children, they noted. The family has 
filed a wrongful death lawsuit in civil court against Meyer and Pancho &amp; 
Wong's. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Alvey said she received a phone call Thursday evening from the Redondo 
Beach police detective investigating the case, notifying her "that he was 
basically going to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and that the murder 
(charge) would be out." 
</P>
<P>
"I was speechless. I broke down and cried," she said. "This just isn't enough 
for a death. I'm a parent. I have lost my son." 
</P>
<P>
Alvey's mother said she first tried to call the state legislators in her 
district but was told they could not help because the matter was a judicial one 
and it would be illegal for them to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
So, she said, she will gather signatures for a petition to present to the 
judge, asking that Meyer be forced to face first-degree murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to stand in front of a market and stop people, I will," Patricia 
Alvey said. "Everybody knows about this incident. I'm sure I'll get a lot of 
signatures." 
</P>
<P>
Betsie Alvey concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"A man that was 25 years old and had three kids doesn't deserve to have 
somebody get away with eight years, good behavior," she said. "No amount of 
years will bring him back, but at least it gives me and my family some feeling 
that he's going to pay for what he's done."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY

Charlotta Ashworth, who recently moved to Torrance from Atlanta, had heard that 
the Los Angeles area was austere and not very friendly at all. So she was 
pleasantly surprised when two strangers knocked on her front door, bearing a 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors were members of Rolling Hills Covenant Church, which recently 
launched a campaign to welcome all new residents to the South Bay with 
hand-delivered housewarming gifts of seedling pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect anything like that," said Ashworth, 46, who said she and her 
family had been told that "the people here were cold." 
</P>
<P>
"If we just do good things in the name of Christ, it's just like planting 
seeds," said Kimberly Creasman, director of the SEEDS campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign is also an attempt to boost the church's membership by 
inviting South Bay newcomers to the church's services. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the seedling pines, wrapped in white tissue paper with a green ribbon, 
come with planting instructions and an invitation to "come grow with us." 
</P>
<P>
And it seems to be working. The Rev. Chuck Olson, the pastor, said the church 
has had double the number of visitors since the campaign began in September. 
</P>
<P>
The church, using volunteers, plans to distribute 10,000 trees by the end of 
October. About 2,000 families have so far received the welcoming gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"If you brought me a rose, in a couple of days, the rose would be gone," 
Ashworth said. "But, with a tree, it's different because it's going to keep on 
growing and living." 
</P>
<P>
The church was able to obtain the addresses of all homes sold in the South Bay 
this summer from area real estate agencies, and about 100 members volunteered 
to deliver the seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a refreshing personal contact of warmth in an increasing age of 
coldness," Creasman said. "People moving out to the L.A. area are incredibly 
lonely because they're surrounded by a metropolis (and they feel that) no one 
cares about them." 
</P>
<P>
Although volunteers often found no one at home when they visited, they left the 
seedlings on the doorstep to welcome the newcomers home. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Shao, 26, was nonplussed when she came home from work one afternoon and 
saw a miniature tree on her front porch. After reading the card that came with 
it, she promptly planted the tree in a pickle barrel and put it in her back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, people give you brochures or ask for money," said Shao, who just 
moved from Carson to Torrance in August. "This time, we're receiving something 
and it's really nice." LILY DIZON

MADDOX STEPS OVER THE LINE AS BRUINS LOSE; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: QUARTERBACK'S APPARENT TOUCHDOWN PASS ON FINAL PLAY IS NULLIFIED BECAUSE 
HE HAD CROSSED THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BEFORE THROWING IT. ARIZONA WINS ON 
70-YARD INTERCEPTION RETURN IN LAST MINUTE, 28-21. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox is a 19-year-old redshirt freshman, but 
Saturday's game against Arizona may linger with him a long time. 
</P>
<P>
He threw three damaging interceptions at the Rose Bowl as Arizona beat UCLA, 
28-21, in a Pacific 10 Conference game before 50,156. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with his team trailing by a touchdown in the waning seconds, it seemed 
for a moment that Maddox had redeemed himself. 
</P>
<P>
With five seconds remaining, UCLA was on the Arizona 35-yard line, fourth and 
10. Maddox scrambled and threw an apparent touchdown pass to wide receiver Sean 
LaChapelle between two Arizona defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was ruled that Maddox had stepped over the line of scrimmage before 
throwing the football and the touchdown was nullified. 
</P>
<P>
Replays showed that Maddox was over the line by about a foot. 
</P>
<P>
So the game ended with UCLA suffering its first conference loss, while Arizona 
stayed alive in the league race. UCLA is 2-3 overall, 2-1 in league play. 
Arizona is 4-1 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I went from the greatest moment of my life to the worst moment of my life," 
said Maddox, referring to the touchdown pass that wasn't allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I knew where the line of scrimmage was, and I thought I had pulled 
up short. As soon as I threw it, somebody hit me and and I wasn't sure I was 
across (the line)." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox said, and it was confirmed by UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, that the Bruins 
would have tried a two-point conversion if the touchdown had been legal. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a minute earlier, UCLA seemed on the verge of winning the game with 
either a touchdown or field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had a first down at the Arizona 36 with the score tied, 21-21. 
Maddox then threw a sideline pass intended for split end Reggie Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Darryl Lewis stepped in front of Moore, intercepted and raced 70 
yards untouched down the sideline for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran the same play before and I didn't get a good jump," Lewis said. "On 
the interception I looked at the wing, and I had a feeling he would throw it my 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was running to the end zone, all I was thinking that it was a long ways 
away. I was just praying I could get there." 
</P>
<P>
It was Lewis' fifth interception of the season. The senior from Nogales High in 
West Covina came into the game sharing the national lead in interceptions with 
four. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw number four (Lewis), but the ball fluttered on me a little bit," Maddox 
said. "It was a ball that shouldn't have been thrown. It cost the game for us." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox's miscues clouded the positive things that the quarterback did, such as 
throwing three touchdown passes to flanker Scott Miller. 
</P>
<P>
However, when it seemed that UCLA was on the verge of pulling away, the Bruins 
let Arizona back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With the score tied, 14-14, in the second quarter, UCLA had second and goal 
at the Arizona five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox threw a pass intended for tight end Corwin Anthony in the end zone, but 
safety Jeff Hammerschmidt intercepted for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A few plays later, UCLA defensive tackle Matt Werner recovered fullback 
Mike Streidnig's fumble at the Arizona 32, but UCLA's Brad Daluiso eventually 
missed a 48-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
So the half ended with the teams still tied, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth quarter, with UCLA leading 21-14, Miller returned a punt 51 
yards for an apparent touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a two-touchdown advantage, the play was nullified when UCLA's Pat 
McPherson was cited for clipping, a 15-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two plays later, with the ball at the UCLA 39, Maddox's short pass intended 
for tight end Randy Austin was intercepted by Arizona linebacker Zeno 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
"One of their defensive linemen grabbed my arm," Maddox said. "I tried to hold 
up, but I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
After Alexander's eight-yard return, the Wildcats drove 35 yards to the tying 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
There were almost six minutes left when UCLA got the ball again. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox drove the Bruins from his 11 to the Wildcat 36, where he threw his last 
interception -- the 70-yard return by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a perfect opportunity to win it," Maddox said. "All we needed was a 
field goal. We didn't take advantage of it, and I made a terrible mistake and 
it cost us the game." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox acknowledged that he didn't have a good day. He completed 14 of 33 
passes for 269 yards. Scott Miller had scoring catches of 40, 45 and 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue wasn't overly critical of his young quarterback saying, "He's young and 
made some mistakes and they hurt our team, but he's a fabulous player, and 
he'll be even better in the future." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arizona came into the game as the leading rushing team in the Pac-10 and the 
worst passing team, averaging only 70.5 yards a game. However, the Wildcats had 
149 yards passing at halftime. Coach Dick Tomey alternated his quarterbacks, 
starter Ronald Veal and George Malauulu. . . . Malauulu was more effective. He 
completed six of 11 passes for 122 yards and was a threat as an option runner. 
He gained 52 yards and scored a touchdown on a six-yard run to tie the score, 
14-14, in the second quarter. . . . "I thought we could pass well against 
UCLA," Tomey said. "Our (run-oriented) offense is geared to making the 
opponent's secondary do things they're not used to doing." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona gained 480 yards rushing last year while beating UCLA, 42-7, in Tucson. 
The Wildcats settled for a more-balanced attack Saturday with 158 yards rushing 
and 178 by passing. UCLA had 425 yards in total offense as tailback Brian Brown 
gained 103 yards rushing.

COLORADO TAKES FIFTH, WINS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BUFFALOES BEAT MISSOURI, 33-31, WHEN THEY SCORE TOUCHDOWN ON 
FINAL PLAY.IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIFTH DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
When push came to shove, 12th-ranked Colorado had enough muscle -- and enough 
downs -- to defeat Missouri on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On what should have been fifth down, backup quarterback Charles Johnson scored 
on the game's final play from the one-yard line to beat the Tigers, 33-31, in a 
Big Eight opener. 
</P>
<P>
Head referee J.C. Louderback said an appeal, if one is allowed, would be up to 
the league's office. 
</P>
<P>
Any touchdown, regardless of error, would be called back "only if there would 
be a penalty," Louderback said. "Our record on the field as officials is that 
they scored on fourth down." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri Coach Bob Stull, after a heated discussion with officials, held out 
little hope for overturning the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was four downs. It was too late. When I talked to them, they 
didn't say much," Stull said. 
</P>
<P>
Big Eight Commissioner Carl James watched the game from the press box, but 
declined to comment on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
As described in the game's official play by play, Colorado's first-down play at 
Missouri's three-yard line in the final minute was an incompletion, when 
Johnson spiked the ball to stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bieniemy, who rushed for 217 yards, then gained two up the middle and the 
Buffaloes called their final timeout. Bieniemy then was stopped as seconds 
ticked away and Johnson again threw a pass into the ground to stop the clock 
with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
That's four downs. Then Johnson just got into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is I scored," said Johnson, who had filled in admirably most of the 
game for injured Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a running play, second down another run play and then the touchdown. My 
head was in the end zone and my shoulders were on the goal line." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the problem came when officials didn't change the down markers to 
third down after Bieniemy's first run. 
</P>
<P>
Another controversy was the officials stopping the clock on Bieniemy's second 
plunge into the line. The Buffaloes wouldn't have had time to run another play 
without the clock being stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they felt we were holding their players down," Stull said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Coach Bill McCartney didn't want to talk about fifth down, only the 
surface of the field that made footing treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest story is not how the game ended, it's that field," McCartney said. 
"It's a joke to college football. Johnson fell down every time he had the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Not every time. On the game's final play, Johnson stayed upright long enough to 
score over right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up and he (the side judge) hadn't signaled. He took like three 
seconds. It seemed like a long time," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed finish negated Kent Kiefer's passing show (19 of 34, 326 yards) 
for upset-minded Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew there were five downs in football," Missouri wide receiver Linzy 
Collins said. "I feel robbed." 
</P>
<P>
There is a 50-year-old precedent for reversing a game's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, with its 18-game win streak on the line, Cornell scored a disputed 
touchdown on fifth down against Dartmouth. A week later, the winning team 
surrendered its 7-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell President Edmund Ezra Day summed up his school's reason for turning 
down a win. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't made the decision, we would have been explaining that game as 
long as football has a place in intercollegiate athletics," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIVE DOWNS TO VICTORY 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 31-27, Colorado had a first and goal at the Missouri three with 31 
seconds left on a pass from Charles Johnson to Jon Bowman. The clock was 
running. Here is the account of the series from the Kansas City Star: 
</P>
<P>
First down: Johnson spiked the ball to stop the clock with 28 seconds 
remaining.

<TEXT>
<P>
Derek Sparks of Mater Dei has been the most talked about high school running 
back in Orange County this season. However, Saturday night against Mission 
Viejo, his name was hardly mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 4,000 attending the Southern Section nonleague showdown at Mission 
Viejo turned their attention to Marcellus Chrishon, a relative unknown who 
rushed for 200 yards in 21 carries and scored four touchdowns to lead Mission 
Viejo to a 42-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon, a 5-foot-9, 150-pound senior, scored on runs of 67, 38, 15 and one 
yards. He had 145 yards rushing by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, the much publicized player who transferred from Montclair Prep last 
month, finished with 138 yards in 23 carries. His only touchdown was on a 
three-yard pass with seven seconds remaining. In his two previous games with 
Mater Dei, Sparks had 465 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo, which begins South Coast League play this week, improved its 
record to 4-1. Mater Dei, which was 2-0 with Sparks in the backfield, dropped 
to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our own Derek Sparks and his name is Marcellus Chrishon," Mission 
Viejo Coach Mike Rush said. "We told our kids before the game to let the sparks 
fly. Give our line a lot of credit, too," 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei scored first on a Cliff Roberts 32-yard field goal in the second 
quarter, but Mission Viejo and Chrishon took over from that point. 
</P>
<P>
Chrishon broke loose for a 67-yard touchdown run on the next possession. His 
15-yard touchdown run five minutes later put the Diablos ahead, 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, when it appeared Chrishon had been dropped for a loss, he 
broke through five tacklers on his way to a 38-yard touchdown run to put his 
Mission Viejo ahead, 35-9. 
</P>
<P>
"All we talked about before the game was Derek Sparks," said Chrishon, who 
hadn't rushed for more than 100 yards in a game this season. "I think Derek 
Sparks just stayed home tonight. We knew we had to stop him and we sure did. 
Our offensive line just played better. I'm very happy." ERIC SHEPARD

Orange Lutheran 33, LA Baptist 14 -- Despite being outgained 231 to 147 in 
total offense, Orange Lutheran won its homecoming game. LA Baptist's hopes for 
a rally were shattered in the third quarter when the Lancers (5-0) scored 13 
points despite running only one play from scrimmage during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Three touchdowns were scored in a 25-second margin in the quarter, two by 
Orange Lutheran without an offensive play. After Baptist's Dane Brown scored on 
an eight-yard run to cut Orange Lutheran's lead to 20-6, Phil Matheson of 
Orange Lutheran returned the kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. Then on the next 
kickoff, the LA Baptist kick returner fumbled at the Baptist 21. Orange 
Lutheran's Lee Back one-hopped the ball and ran into the end zone, giving the 
Lancers a 33-6 lead.

un Coleman scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns as Dana Hills High School beat 
University, 24-14, in a nonleague game Saturday night at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills (3-1-1) came back from a 14-0 deficit after University (2-3) had 
taken advantage of four early Dana Hills fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman scored on touchdown runs of one and five yards in the final four 
minutes. Dana Hills trailed, 14-10, with 6:30 left when the Dolphins drove 50 
yards for a touchdown. Coleman's one-yard run capped the drive and gave Dana 
Hills a 17-14 lead with 2:57 left. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Stanley of Dana Hills then recovered a fumble at the University 20 and 
three plays later, Coleman ran it in from the five to put the game out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
University surprised Dana Hills in the first quarter, scoring a touchdown after 
a poor snap from center on a field goal attempt. Holder Matt Selman picked up 
the low snap and hit tight end Josh Taussig for a 16-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans scored again early in the second quarter as Brian Vail threw a 
12-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Apana. University's drive, set up by Bernard 
Gardner's fumble recovery, went 60 yards in seven plays. 
</P>
<P>
But Dana Hills made it, 14-7, as quarterback Albie Sukut ran 11 yards for a 
touchdown with 7:46 left in the half. Dana Hills closed the gap to 14-10 on 
John Ashley's 35-yard field goal.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: HEADACHE RELIEF BY ALAN M. RAPOPORT MD AND FRED D. SHEFTELL 
MD (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is not a book for hypochondriacs. The authors have produced a 
comprehensive look at a medical problem that affects more than 90% of the U.S. 
population at one time or another each year. Most of us gobble down an 
over-the-counter remedy -- 64 million aspirin tablets a day taken only for 
headaches, plus other, non-aspirin pills. In 1987, we spent more than $2.1 
billion for these pain relievers. But 20% of all Americans suffer headaches so 
intolerable that they are forced to seek medical help. If they are unlucky, 
they see doctors who either don't take them seriously or who put them on 
medications that may be addictive, and often don't relieve the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if they are lucky, they go to people like the authors, founding directors 
of The New England Center for Headache. Rapoport and Sheftell believe that 
headaches are triggered by a biological mechanism, "apparently one the headache 
sufferer is born with," an unhappy revelation for those who don't believe in 
predeterminism. 
</P>
<P>
To conquer the pain, no matter its source, the authors prefer about anything to 
a pill. They believe that headaches can often best be treated with exercise, 
biofeedback techniques and diet. They do prescribe medication where necessary, 
but only in the smallest practicable dosages. 
</P>
<P>
The book's opening list of various kinds of headaches (cluster headaches, for 
example, are worse than migraines -- so painful that sufferers often bash their 
heads against a wall) and their causes (from brain tumors to "tension") is as 
sobering as viewing an auto wreck. Its only consolation is that most of us can 
say, "There but for the grace of . . . " to most of the forms of headaches. 
</P>
<P>
There is one bit of humor in that list, certainly unintentional, and the only 
laugh in the book: a brief discussion of "benign orgasmic cephalgia" -- sex 
headaches. The straight-faced medical advice about when to take the problem to 
an emergency room for evaluation could certainly inspire a screamingly funny 
movie scene.

GOP PADS LEAD IN O.C. STRONGHOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With just three days left to register voters for the November election, the 
Orange County Republican machine is expanding its commanding lead over 
Democrats in every corner of the county, even closing the gap in the only 
district where Democrats now lead. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, both parties launched their final intensive drives to recruit new 
members as they deploy hundreds of workers across the county to knock on doors, 
telephone potential voters and staff registration tables at shopping malls, 
swap meets and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be hectic -- intense is a good word," said Mark Galli, 
project coordinator for the Democratic Party's registration drive in Orange 
County. "A lot of politics is an abstract thing . . . this is democracy at 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in California do Republicans have a bigger lead over Democrats than in 
Orange County. And since the last general election in 1988, the GOP has 
increased the margin by another 2%, or about 25,000 potential votes. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, 55.6% of the county's voters were Republican compared to 34% 
Democrats. In the 1988 presidential election, Republicans had an edge of 54.3% 
to 35.3%. 
</P>
<P>
With such a large pool of Republican votes, the county's registration effort 
has been a high priority for the state GOP as well as the gubernatorial 
campaign of Republican Pete Wilson. All of the Republican candidates seeking 
statewide office need as many votes as possible from Orange County to offset 
predominantly Democratic areas of Los Angeles and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Party officials say they have spent more than $300,000 this year for 
the voter registration effort for the Nov. 6 election. When Vice President Dan 
Quayle visited the area last month, he attended a $1,000-per-couple fund-raiser 
specifically for local voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the Republican Party had more than 100 paid and volunteer workers 
operating phone banks from offices in eight cities -- Huntington Beach, 
Fountain Valley, Stanton, Garden Grove, Newport Beach, San Juan Capistrano, 
Yorba Linda and Westminster, said Greg Haskin, executive director of the county 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
The callers were asking Republican households whether every eligible resident 
is registered, appealing to the non-registered people and calling Democrats as 
well to try to convert them. Haskins said each office had runners deliver 
registration material to any house that sounded interested in joining the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
At least another 100 volunteers were walking door-to-door, Haskins said. And 
the party sponsored several registration tables at its regional offices as well 
as at grocery stores and the Orange County Swap Meet. 
</P>
<P>
In one bold tactic, the county Republican Party recently sent a letter to 
registered Democrats that read: "If you find it difficult to identify with 
Democratic leaders such as (Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown, (Assemblyman) Tom 
Hayden, (former Vice President) Walter Mondale and your newly elected 
California Democrat Party Chairman, Jerry Brown, (Yes, that Jerry Brown), then 
consider joining us." 
</P>
<P>
Haskin said Republicans consider this year especially important to register 
voters because the tallies will be used to determine the reapportionment that 
is scheduled before the 1992 election. The more concentrated Republicans are in 
Orange County, the harder it would be to threaten any of the existing 
Republican officeholders by redrawing the district lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The substantial Republican effort has increased the party's registration in 
every legislative district in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Democrats are focusing their registration effort almost completely 
in the 72nd Assembly District, the only area in the county that has more 
Democratic voters than Republican. And even there, Democrats have lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) is one of the highest 
priorities for state Democratic leaders because he represents one of the most 
Democratic districts in California that is still in the hands of a Republican. 
The district includes parts of Westminster, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove 
and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans have had registration workers mining that area for votes year-round 
since 1984. In contrast, the state Democratic Party just opened its office in 
Stanton on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Republicans are 4% closer to the Democratic registration than they 
were when Pringle won the seat in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats now have about 51.7% of the district's voters compared to 39.3% for 
Republicans. In 1988, the Democratic lead was 53.6% to 37.3%. In 1984, the last 
time Democrats held the seat, they accounted for 56% of the district's voters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Orange County -- it's tough here," said George Urch, campaign manager 
for Pringle's Democratic opponent, Tom Umberg. "We bear the brunt of the whole 
statewide Pete Wilson registration effort." 
</P>
<P>
State Democratic leaders had promised to launch a $25,000 registration drive in 
the 72nd District last March. Nothing was done until August and party officials 
declined to say how much they are spending. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic project in Stanton has 18 paid registration workers. On 
Thursday, they met their goal of registering 3,000 new voters. This weekend, 
they set up registration tables at several stores and malls in and near the 
72nd District, and canvassed door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats in the 72nd District have out-registered the GOP in the seven weeks 
since their project was started. But they have not made up the lead Republicans 
have gained, especially since the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
"We are holding our own," Urch said. "If we just rolled over and didn't do a 
thing, that margin would be huge." 
</P>
<P>
County Democratic Chairman Michael Balmages said his party does not have any 
other formal registration effort elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Left alone in other districts, Republicans have shown increases even in the 
areas they dominated overwhelmingly. 
</P>
<P>
GOP Assemblyman Gil Ferguson's Newport Beach district is the most Republican in 
California. There, Republicans increased their 1988 margin by about 1% for the 
upcoming election. They now lead in that area by 61.7% to 27.1%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

DEVELOPMENT PERILS WILDLIFE, STUDY SAYS

ARROYO TRABUCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Southern California's richest natural habitats -- home to a dwindling 
wildlife population of deer and rare California birds -- is being polluted and 
destroyed by surrounding subdivisions, according to environmental consultants 
hired by county planners. 
</P>
<P>
And unless a development on the drawing boards of the Santa Margarita Co. is 
moved hundreds of feet farther back than proposed, the consultants contend, 
much of the remaining natural resource will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Friday, the consultants charged that the company's Las 
Flores Planned Community could tarnish an adjacent 5-mile stretch of lush 
creek-bed canyon, known as the Arroyo Trabuco, just east of Mission Viejo. It 
was made part of the O'Neill Regional Park in 1982 and later declared a 
protected wilderness area. But the consultants say county planning officials 
have consistently allowed developers to build too close to the fragile canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita executives dismissed the findings, noting that the report's 
chief author, biologist Karlin Marsh, has already testified against the Las 
Flores project. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Santa Margarita Co. President Anthony R. Moiso 
complained that critics of his project are extremists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not Yellowstone, this is not some pristine wilderness," Moiso said. 
"This canyon is beautiful, but it's surrounded by a half-million people. . . . 
It's just nutty." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the county considers approving the development, federal officials are 
investigating whether Santa Margarita violated fish and wildlife laws by 
destroying 154 acres of the property's coastal sagebrush, which provides 
nesting for the San Diego cactus wren and the California gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita executives acknowledge that the ground was plowed, but say an 
employee mistakenly thought that barley was to be planted there, as it is on 
some adjoining agricultural fields. 
</P>
<P>
The executives say Santa Margarita has a generous record of setting aside 
natural habitats as parkland, and they reject any suggestion that the land -- 
now designated to hold houses -- was deliberately harmed to make way for the 
development. They complain that federal interest in their project is being 
driven by an increasingly strident minority of county residents who are intent 
on stopping all development. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do they get the idea that I represent the minority?" asked Peter 
DeSimone, the National Audubon Society's manager of the Starr Ranch Sanctuary 
in South County. "People in Orange County are starting to become much more 
environmentally sensitive. I think they (company executives) are living in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
The consultants' report, compiled by Marsh and two other wildlife biologists 
for the Environmental Management Agency's division of Harbors, Beaches and 
Parks, is only the latest salvo in what has been a 20-month war over Las 
Flores. Santa Margarita executives say the 1,000-acre planned community, more 
than half of which would remain open space, would both protect the delicate 
arroyo and provide desperately needed affordable housing for another rare 
species: the first-time home buyer in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The development debate is expected to prove to be a pivotal one. Company 
executives cast it as a test case for future growth in the county, while 
environmentalists see it as a last chance to rescue one of the region's richest 
habitats by blocking suburban encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides also say the county's handling of Las Flores thus far stands as a 
textbook example of how Orange County's system of planning works or fails, 
depending on who offers the assessment. The next hearing on the issue is 
scheduled for Tuesday when the Planning Commission will consider a staff 
report. 
</P>
<P>
"The process is a good one," said Moiso, the silver-haired, cowboy-booted 
great-grandson of wealthy landowner Richard O'Neill. "The plan is better now 
than when it was first submitted." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists complain, however, that the Planning Commission process has 
been heavily weighted in favor of the developer. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing last month, DeSimone -- who stresses that he does not oppose 
"reasonable" development -- complained that commissioners seemed more eager to 
justify the project than seriously evaluate its environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone's comment came during verbal sparring with Planning Commission 
Chairman Stephen A. Nordeck, who complained that commissioners were being asked 
to protect deer and other wildlife in the arroyo "when we don't technically 
know what's left." 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone responded: "If we had enough information for the arroyo, then we could 
make a real sound decision. If the commission feels we don't have enough 
information, then why are we to this point?" 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners displayed impatience with the opposing environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think deer and an urban development mix," said Commissioner Roger 
D. Slate. Then he quipped, "Why don't we plant some apple orchards and put some 
salt licks out there, and issue some hunting licenses?" 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Earl Wooden suggested that the project could be fine-tuned later 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get down to real precise planning down the road," Wooden said, "and 
there'll be another time to talk about 'so many feet'. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone replied: "My experience has shown me when you get to that stage it's 
kind of impossible to do anything, it's kind of an 11th-hour thing and it 
doesn't really work." 
</P>
<P>
Las Flores would lie immediately south of the company's Rancho Santa Margarita 
development, a still growing community of 15,000 residents and 3,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned, it would be a collection of 2,500 homes dotted with schools, 
parks and offices. About half the land, 555 acres, would remain as open space. 
</P>
<P>
And about half of the homes would sell for less than $200,000, at least $50,000 
below what is now the average selling price for a house in Orange County, 
company executives say. The project also provides some light industry and 
research and development job sites, so residents could go to work without 
having to commute on clogged highways. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives have said the development would at various points be from 
300 feet to 1,800 feet from the bluff top edge of Arroyo Trabuco, a distance 
they describe as ample to protect the fragile ecology there. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Donald Moe, Santa Margarita's senior vice president for corporate 
affairs, argues that the project represents "a new generation of urban 
planning" that is highly sensitive to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The county's environmental consultants dispute that. 
</P>
<P>
According to their report, Las Flores would provide at most a buffer of 200 
feet of natural habitat and another 100 feet of landscaped transitional area. 
At some spots, the project would leave only 15 feet to 65 feet of natural 
habitat along with a transition area of 100 feet from the Tijeras Creek, which 
branches off of Arroyo Trabuco. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants conclude that a buffer of at least 400 feet is needed to 
protect remaining deer in the arroyo, from 400 feet to 900 feet to protect 
predatory birds and from 400 feet to 800 feet to protect the gnatcatcher, which 
is expected to be added to the federal endangered species list within the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The probable future listing of this bird makes adequate gnatcatcher 
(protection) particularly crucial," the consultants said. In a section written 
by Marsh, the consultants chided county officials for failing to demand wider 
buffer zones from Santa Margarita and other developers, noting that experts 
warned as far back as 1980 of the danger of placing houses too close to the 
arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing visible from the arroyo floor, graded slopes, a golf course 
unnaturally green with irrigation, traffic noise and span bridges all detract 
from the wilderness aesthetic setting the arroyo was intended to preserve," the 
consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
". . . The impacts of encroaching residential development took their toll on 
several of the arroyo's wildlife species." 
</P>
<P>
Deer appear to have declined in the arroyo by about 90%, largely because of 
development from nearby Mission Viejo, the consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants also say that storm drain runoff, including "oil, grease and 
other pollutants" from Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita, appear to be 
degrading the arroyo and endangering "clean-water dependent" wildlife that 
lives there. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the company be required to replace the lost coastal 
sage shrub by setting aside a similar amount elsewhere in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Company executives note that while 253 acres of Las Flores sage shrub would 
destroyed by the development, 379 acres would be saved. Only 10 pairs of cactus 
wren and 4 pairs of gnatcatchers would be lost, while that many or more of the 
birds would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
"We pay all the bills" for highways and other public amenities needed by county 
residents, Moiso concluded. "I think that we really are responsible citizens. 
The development community is not the problem. It's the solution." 
</P>
<P>

SHUTDOWN HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON CALIFORNIA IN FIRST DAY; 
</P>
<P>
CLOSINGS: THE BUDGET DEADLOCK LEADS MOSTLY TO CONFUSION AND PETTY ANNOYANCES. 
YOSEMITE RANGERS ARE SHUTTING CAMPSITES TODAY.

Thousands of campers in Yosemite National Park began getting the bad news 
Saturday morning. Because of the federal budget stalemate, all campsites in the 
park will be closed at 1 p.m. today,) although the Ahwahnee Hotel, Yosemite 
Lodge and other facilities operated by the Curry Co. will remain open, as will 
the visitor center with a reduced staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We are technically closed right now but the gates are still open because it's 
difficult to close Yosemite in a short period of time," said Park Ranger Bob 
Clopine. "We're confused but we're making the best of a difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
For most Californians, there were few such problems Saturday because the vast 
majority of federal agencies were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Some part-time census workers even put in a day of overtime as they rushed to 
complete the field work for the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Winston, a Census Bureau district manager in Panorama City, said he and 11 
others were told Friday to report to work Saturday regardless of what problems 
Congress was having with the budget. "I don't know if we're going to get paid, 
but we have to assume they know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center at Angeles National Forest remained open, thanks to a budget 
surplus that will allow it and those at other national forests in California to 
continue operations until Oct. 15. "After that, God only knows," said Ranger 
Gerry Reponen from the Chilao Visitor Center. 
</P>
<P>
And campgrounds in Cleveland National Forest remained open Saturday. "Nobody is 
being sent away," said a worker at the El Cariso visitor information center, 
just over the Orange County line in Riverside County. "We still have campers." 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol -- which has more than 800 employees in the San Diego area, 
the nation's largest such contingent -- was conducting normal operations. 
</P>
<P>
The budget deadlock, however, touched Southern Californians in small ways. 
Alfred Golden, first vice president of Seniors for Action, a senior citizens 
political action group, said a toll-free number available to "tell Congress 
exactly how we feel" was not in service. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center was closed at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area and scheduled nature hikes for weekend visitors were canceled, although 
the area was open to those who want to hike on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands National Park visitor center in Ventura was also closed. 
Private boat operators are still providing tours of the islands, but rangers 
will not guide them. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, the seaside Cabrillo National Monument was closed. "What is 
surprising is the number of visitors we turned away who had no idea this was 
going on," Ranger Mark Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center in Sequoia National Park was closed and all naturalists 
talks and hikes canceled. The campgrounds remained open. Because of the 
reduction in services, however, no entrance fees were being collected. 
</P>
<P>
At Yosemite, visited by 3.4 million people last year, park entrances were open 
and rangers continued to collect fees, although visitors were being warned that 
services are limited. 
</P>
<P>
Guided walks and ranger programs have been halted, Yosemite's Clopine said. And 
if Congress fails to find a budget solution by this afternoon, the campgrounds 
will be closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's horrible," said Becky Vaccarezza of Stockton, who months ago had 
made reservations for a weeklong vacation with five other adults and six 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're at home you deal with the bills and everything. But when you come 
up here, this is everybody's escape. This is how you're supposed to get away 
from budgets. It's a major disappointment. We had so many plans for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
The 550 park workers have been told to report Tuesday, after the Columbus Day 
holiday, when they will find out whether they will continue working or be put 
on furlough.

MAN HELD IN SIEGE OVER A $20 DEBT 
</P>

Walter Phillip Hallstein wanted $20 for a wading pool he had sold to a family 
six months ago at a garage sale, say police. 
</P>
<P>
And he meant business. 
</P>
<P>
So shortly before noon Saturday, the 53-year-old Rossmoor man, toting a 
12-gauge shotgun, allegedly went to the home of David Elizondo on Yellowtail 
Drive in Rossmoor, held six adults and six children at gunpoint inside the 
house for a few minutes and collected his money, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he left in a white station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour search involving helicopters and deputies on the ground, 
Hallstein was arrested without incident with the shotgun at 3:43 p.m. at Martha 
Ann Drive and Bostonian Drive in Rossmoor, sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey said. 
</P>
<P>
Hallstein was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of residential 
robbery. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Harold Schaffroth said, "Sometimes people do things I just can't 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
Rossmoor is an unincorporated area of about 5,000 to 6,000 homes in western 
Orange County, between Los Alamitos and Seal Beach.

HOBBY: 150 ENTHUSIASTS GATHER FOR THE ANNUAL HOT WHEELS CONVENTION IN BUENA 
PARK AND WANDER HOTEL ROOMS IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT TOY.

For $500 to $600, Michael Strauss may be willing to sell his vintage Volkswagen 
bus decorated with brightly colored flowers typifying the 1960s, with two 
surfboards sticking out the back window. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect to drive this car. It has no engine and is just a few inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rare toy that Hot Wheels enthusiasts would eagerly bid on if Strauss, 
47, were ever to auction it off. But the collector from San Carlos in San Mateo 
County said he will probably never sell it because it means too much to him. 
</P>
<P>
The bus is one of several rare models from his Hot Wheels collection -- which 
numbers 15,000 miniature cars -- that he proudly displayed Saturday during a 
Hot Wheels convention held this weekend in Buena Park. Mattel Inc. makes Hot 
Wheels under that trade name but does not sponsor the convention. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 150 Hot Wheels enthusiasts gathered at the fourth annual 
convention's headquarters hotel and traveled from room to room Saturday to view 
models, hoping to find that one car that might be someone else's extra piece 
but is the just the model needed for another collector's set. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no different than collecting barbed wire or Avon bottles," said Rock 
Cramer, 54, a retired Army officer from El Paso, who has been collecting Hot 
Wheels since 1968, when they were first produced. 
</P>
<P>
Especially coveted are the extra-special cars, dune buggies and trucks that 
these grown-up kids are willing to trade, buy or sell for hundreds of dollars. 
They may be more valuable because they are older, were produced in limited 
quantities or even because of the manufacturer's error. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer pointed to a Shell gasoline tanker that is painted orange even though 
the trucks are supposed to be yellow. 
</P>
<P>
"So in 10 or 15 years from now, that orange tanker may be a good one," worth 
maybe $100 to $300, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attending his first show was George Dolmat, 31, a electronics designer from 
Montreal who began collecting the models three years ago when he bought some 
for his son. 
</P>
<P>
He said his son is allowed to play with the cars from the collection, but the 
boy has to be careful not to scratch the models. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows those are Daddy's cars and to be nice to them," Dolmat said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolmat said he even tried to get insurance for his 900-model collection, but 
the company said, "You can't do it because it's something you can't put a value 
on."

NOTEBOOK: PAYING A PRICE FOR GIFT OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us probably remember the awkward times in our childhood when we began 
exploring confusing and sometimes embarrassing topics. 
</P>
<P>
For my friends and me in rural Kennett Square, Pa., reproduction was a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
I remember when my friend, Tommy Dewey, and I first discussed our origins while 
riding the bus home from grade school one day. The question was simple enough: 
Where did you come from? 
</P>
<P>
Other kids joined in. I recall giving the credit to my parents. But Tommy threw 
us all for a loop. A "Star Trek" fanatic, Tommy told us that "Scotty" had made 
him. 
</P>
<P>
It is with that same innocence that those with the National Coalition Against 
Surrogacy would like us to consider cases like Anna L. Johnson and the 
estimated 4,000 children who have born into surrogate relationships, according 
to statistics compiled by the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when children born to surrogate mothers grow up? 
</P>
<P>
Those involved with the coalition are promising reporters that we will soon be 
writing and telling tragic stories of human greed. 
</P>
<P>
"What is a kid going to think when he or she finds that the birth mother 
remodeled her kitchen with money from a (surrogate) contract?" asks Sharon 
Huddle-DeAngelo. 
</P>
<P>
Strip away the rhetoric from both sides of this issue and you still find the 
lives of children born into surrogate relationships. 
</P>
<P>
It also still leaves the delicate task of explaining these contracts -- and the 
money -- to children who are growing older and no doubt riding the school 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Fagen, co-director of the Center for Surrogate Parenting, said the first 
child produced by a surrogate relationship was born in 1975, making him or her 
about 14 years old now. 
</P>
<P>
He says the center encourages parents of surrogate children to explain to their 
kids that they were "born out of special relationships," that they were 
specially wanted by their parents, who happened to be infertile. 
</P>
<P>
He said the center encourages parents to be open with their children, urging 
them to provide any information to them, even details about their surrogate 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 study of children and families involved in surrogacy suggests that 
levels of stress are within normal limits. 
</P>
<P>
The study included 11 children born to surrogate mothers and 41 children who 
are members of the surrogates' families. 
</P>
<P>
Still, people such as Huddle-DeAngelo and Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, surrogate 
mother in the famous Baby M case who is now involved with the coalition, say 
surrogate arrangements -- especially those in which women are paid for carrying 
other people's babies -- must end. 
</P>
<P>
They say such contracts and transactions are equivalent to "breeding." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to face that, so we call it surrogacy," Huddle-DeAngelo said. "I 
don't think children will like it at all when they find out they were exchanged 
for money." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at human bonding," Whitehead-Gould said recently of the 
Johnson case. "What about the child, years later, who learns he or she was sold 
for $10,000?" 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, it seems that any kid might have an easier time understanding Tommy's 
cosmic explanation than one involving a surrogate mother and $10,000.

After a shaky start, they performed admirably, keying the Toreros' 21-17 
victory in front of about 1,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave USD a 4-1 record heading into its homecoming next week against 
UC Santa Barbara. Pomona-Pitzer, which was enjoying its best start since 1970, 
fell to 3-1. USD is 17-0-1 against Pomona-Pitzer since the series began in 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer quarterback Scott Hamburg completed his first four passes and six 
of seven en route to a 101-yard first-quarter total. His first pass of the 
second quarter -- a 25-yard alley-oop touchdown to Mike Dodd in the back of the 
end zone -- gave the Sagehens a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Hamburg completed only five of 26 for 49 yards. Three of those 
attempts were intercepted, and at least three others could have been. Paladino, 
Barrett and Jackson made the picks. 
</P>
<P>
Paladino's set up USD's first touchdown, Barrett's set up the final touchdown 
and Jackson's came with 50 seconds remaining as Pomona-Pitzer was attempting to 
pull off its fourth come-from-behind victory in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing a little soft in the first quarter," Paladino said. "We 
tightened up (our coverage) after that. The big thing was, once (the defensive 
front) started to put some pressure on (Hamburg), it made it easier for us." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big challenge for us," Barrett said. "This showed we have a lot of 
character. (As far as the first quarter), I think it was just a process of 
settling down and playing our type of defense." 
</P>
<P>
USD's defense, which surrendered 451 yards in a 28-14 loss to Redlands last 
week, yielded 250 yards to the Sagehens, 175 through the air, and only 60 total 
in the second half. The three interceptions were a season high and gives USD 
eight for the year, one more than all of last season. Dodd's touchdown was the 
first passing score against USD this season. A fourth-quarter, 41-yard field 
goal by the Sagehens' Mike Cass was only the 17th point allowed by USD in the 
second half this season. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 7-0, USD tied the game on a 13-yard run by quarterback Brendan Murphy 
with 6:00 left in the first half, but Pomona-Pitzer quickly got back on top. 
Nate Birtman returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third quarter, Bobby Tubbs recovered a Pomona-Pitzer fumble, 
giving USD the ball at the Sagehen 20. Three plays later, Greg Livengood scored 
his first college touchdown on a one-yard run over left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
After Barrett's interception, USD went ahead for good, 21-14, with 12:30 left. 
Murphy capped a seven-play, 35-yard drive with a one-yard quarterback sneak for 
his second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a particularly stellar day for USD's offense -- it converted only 
two of 16 third-down opportunities -- but USD Coach Brian Fogarty said that's 
because he was too conservative in his play calling. "Most of it was me being 
conservative," Fogarty said. "We thought we would move the ball better, but we 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, John Gillis punted 12 times for 448 yards. The yardage total broke 
Joe Amidon's school record (set in 1975) by one yard. The 12 punts tied 
Amidon's school mark set in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
USD finished with a respectable 285 total yards, 191 on the ground. John Eck 
led all rushers with 81 yards in 13 carries. Livengood added 62 in 12 carries. 
Murphy had 94 yards passing but completed only four of 15.

BENNETT LEADS MORSE IN 44-6 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The headline act at Morse this season is its offensive backfield. Tommy 
Bennett, a Morse wide receiver and defensive back, admits that. 
</P>
<P>
But it sure looked as if he was trying to steal the show, as No. 1 Morse 
dismantled Lincoln, 44-6, in front of a crowd estimated at 3,700 at Mesa 
College Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Teddy Lawrence, who leads the county in rushing average (18.7), 
gave Morse (5-0) a 7-0 lead on a flashy 78-yard scoring run in the first 
quarter. Sophomore Conan Smith had three rushing touchdowns. And Gary Taylor, 
who leads the county in rushing yardage, gained 159 yards and went over 1,000 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett may have made the three biggest plays to spark Morse and wreck 
Lincoln's afternoon. With Lincoln driving at the Morse 22-yard line early in 
the first quarter, Bennett made a one-handed interception of Randy Walker's 
pass and returned it to the 22, where Lawrence broke loose for his long 
touchdown on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Then late in the third quarter, Bennett thwarted the only other legitimate 
Lincoln threat before the Hornets scored with 1:22 left in the game. Lincoln 
had second down at the Morse eight when Walker made a bad pitchout and Bennett 
recovered it. 
</P>
<P>
The third big play by Bennett came 48 seconds before halftime and put the nail 
in Lincoln's coffin. He took Lawrence's only pass of the first half 52 yards 
for a touchdown that made it 30-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy's one of the best athletes in the county," Morse coach John Shacklett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who sprained his right ankle in practice Tuesday, gained 125 of his 
yards in the second half while Morse protected its lead. He scored on a 
six-yard run to make it 37-0 two seconds into the fourth quarter. His next 
carry, a nine-yarder up the middle, put him over 1,000. Unofficially, Taylor 
has 1,046 yards after five games. DANA HADDAD

AZTEC NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
SECOND-QUARTER TOUCHDOWN THE TURNING POINT THAT WASN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LARAMIE, Wyo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the What-Might-Have-Been Dept., a 65-yard second-quarter touchdown pass from 
SDSU quarterback Dan McGwire to Dennis Arey may have been the turning point had 
the Aztec defense not performed like it was in a coma and had Wyoming not have 
defeated SDSU, 52-51. 
</P>
<P>
It came on third and seven from the Aztec 35 and SDSU was trailing, 14-3. 
Wyoming put 10 defenders on the line of scrimmage and blitzed. McGwire, picking 
up on it, called an audible. 
</P>
<P>
On SDSU's previous possession, two Wyoming blitzes had forced the Aztecs to 
kick a field goal when they could have had a touchdown. SDSU was trailing, 7-0, 
and had a second down on the Wyoming 9. But two blitzes resulted in sacks -- 
one by linebacker Jarod Thiele and the other by free safety Brian Bowker -- 
pushing SDSU back to the 28 and bringing Andy Trakas on for a 46-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in with a new blitz we had not seen," SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. 
"We ran a slant and hit it, and then didn't see (that particular blitz) 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
They can't escape it. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Aztecs ran into a fired up Brigham Young team when the Provo 
newspaper picked up a story from the Daily Aztec which poked fun at Mormons. 
Now, on the high plains of Wyoming, SDSU found itself mired in another 
controversy Saturday, also sparked by a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The Casper Star printed a story in Friday's edition which quoted SDSU Coach Al 
Luginbill as saying: "I think Wyoming as a football program feels San Diego 
State is not tough as them. A year ago, I think we shocked them by hitting them 
in the mouth (a 27-17 Aztec victory) and playing with them. I think we'll do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
He was quoted further as saying: "They're 5-0, yet most of their games have 
been close going into the fourth quarter. They're not a dominating team like 
they were in '87 when they'd win by 30, 40 or 50 points." 
</P>
<P>
The statements were attributed to an Associated Press story, and Luginbill 
denied making them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea how those fabrications got into the paper," a visibly angry 
Luginbill said after the game. "It's absolutely absurd. I don't ever want to 
demean a university. That's never been my style. Why would I start now? It 
doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that no San Diego reporter heard Luginbill make those 
statements. An SDSU official checked with the AP writer in San Diego, who said 
the Casper paper took them out of context. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard about them," Wyoming quarterback Tom Corontzos said. "Everyone knew 
about them. We took it a little bit personally."

RALLY: GANGS TOLD TO LEAVE; 
</P>
<P>
NEIGHBORS PULL TOGETHER TO SEND MESSAGE TO GANGS: 'GET OUT OF HERE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You're in your back yard, and two armed teen-agers run by. Later that month, 
you learn that two other youths were gunned down in the graffiti-lined alley 
behind some nearby apartments. And those are just the latest signs that 
gangsters have invaded your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Do you put your house up for sale or look for another apartment? Decide to 
rename your community to disassociate it from the rest of Van Nuys? Cower 
indoors and hope the gangbangers go away? 
</P>
<P>
Not if you live near Victory Boulevard and Fulton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 residents from that area joined police and city officials Saturday 
morning in an outdoor rally to encourage the community to drive gangs out by 
constantly reporting their activities to police. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was staged half a block from the site of a Sept. 23 shooting in the 
alley behind the 13100 block of Victory Boulevard in which one man died and 
another was wounded. A 17-year-old North Hollywood gang member is in jail 
charged with murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all afraid," said Wylie Gustafson, the resident who was standing in his 
yard recently when armed youths ran by. "But we're not going to let fear rule 
our decisions. We're going to let gang members know that they're not welcome in 
this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The gathering in the front yard of a single-family house on Mary Ellen Avenue 
was unusual because it drew Latino and white neighbors, apartment dwellers as 
well as homeowners, alike. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Campbell, president of the Tract 15105 Neighborhood Assn., which 
organized the event, said the group distributed flyers in Spanish for the first 
time since it was formed 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just as fearful as us, and we can't do it without them," Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Angel Lopez, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang 
unit, translated into Spanish as police and a representative of Councilman Joel 
Wachs' office encouraged residents to report all crimes -- even gatherings of 
youths that violate the city's anti-loitering laws. 
</P>
<P>
But Martha Rojas, who manages six apartment buildings in the 13000 block of 
Victory Boulevard nearby, said she has called police about large gatherings, 
and they have failed to show up. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Sidney Mills, head of the Van Nuys Division, said he would pay 
personal attention to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm paid $90,000 a year to sit in a little office, and I've got all kinds of 
time, so call me personally at 989-8332 to report a crime," Mills said. "If 
you'll be our eyes and ears, even if it's anonymously, I promise you we can 
maintain a high quality of life in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said heightened scrutiny by residents would drive gang members away 
rather than incite them. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this shows them that they're going to get a lot of attention, 
and they don't like that," Lopez said, adding that gang members have drifted 
into the area recently because their home turfs nearby are heavily policed. 
"It's become hot at home for them, so they have some friends in the apartments 
and start hanging out in the alleys out here." 
</P>
<P>
Some Latino residents complained after the rally that Lopez did not speak 
Spanish well enough to translate adequately. The language barrier somehow must 
be overcome if the neighborhood is to successfully unite, they said. But the 
rally was a significant first step. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't want to get involved, because they're afraid, but if the 
gangs see we're mad like this, they'll slack off," said resident Ruben 
Rodriguez, 34.

STUDY WILL TRACK ENCINO HILLS MOTORISTS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTE: RESIDENTS SAY FREEWAY REFUGEES ARE CUTTING THROUGH AND CLOGGING THEIR 
STREETS. THE ONE-DAY STUDY MAY LEAD TO SOME SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For years, residents of Encino's affluent hillside neighborhoods have 
complained bitterly about commuters cutting through their quiet side streets to 
avoid the logjammed interchange of the Ventura and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
This month, in what is believed will be the most extensive survey of its kind, 
the city Department of Traffic will try to trace the source of the trouble by 
charting not only the number of cars on hillside streets but also their origins 
and destinations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of looking for the bad guy; it's just understanding the 
route people take to get to their destinations," said Thomas Jones, the senior 
transportation engineer who is designing the study. "A lot of it may be 
generated by the hillside population itself." 
</P>
<P>
The one-day survey -- which will be conducted on a date and at locations that 
have yet to be decided -- will measure traffic between the San Diego Freeway 
and Topanga Canyon, including the 19 square miles of Encino and Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills may be included if necessary, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for workers to fan out through the area during the morning rush 
hour and record the license-plate numbers of cars and the times they enter 
hillside streets. 
</P>
<P>
Other counters, standing at the streets' opposite ends, will record the license 
plates of the cars as they leave. 
</P>
<P>
That will enable the surveyors to determine whether complainers and commuters 
are one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
Results will be submitted to Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic foes, including the 400-member Encino Hillside Traffic Safety 
Organization, hope the study will prompt short-term solutions such as more stop 
signs and restrictions on turns. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, the group remains committed to having the dirt portion of 
Mulholland Drive west of Encino paved -- a proposal that has provoked 
fistfights between proponents and environmentalists and residents in 
neighboring Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been pushing for a decade to have about 3 miles of Mulholland 
west of Encino Hills Drive paved in the belief that the resulting, mostly 
east-west cross-mountain route for commuters from Tarzana and Woodland Hills 
would ease the burden on Encino side streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the study is to see if there are any immediate measures that can 
be done to control the traffic," said Madeline DeAntonio, the traffic group's 
president. "But it is not in lieu of the Mulholland Drive plan. We still expect 
the paving of Mulholland." 
</P>
<P>
For now, they are getting a traffic survey that officials say is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest I know of for a neighborhood study, probably the whole 
city," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Miscikowski, Braude's chief deputy, said it is unusual for a traffic 
survey to track destinations instead of merely counting the number of cars. 
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly a sense of a different kind of traffic problem," Miscikowski 
said. "And it's something they want to look at with a new set of eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Although traffic jams are a problem citywide, Encino residents say they, in 
particular, are being victimized by freeway refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Denizens of this world of tennis bracelets, French manicures and Gucci loafers 
say they are hardest hit because their streets abut the Ventura-San Diego 
Freeway interchange as well as Sepulveda Boulevard, the original and still 
popular route from the San Fernando Valley into the Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent escape hatch favored by commuters heading east on the Ventura 
Freeway toward the Westside and downtown is to exit at Louise Avenue and head 
south for the hills. 
</P>
<P>
They then wend their way past lavishly landscaped lots on winding narrow 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
One popular shortcut goes from Louise, along side streets to Hayvenhurst Avenue 
and then on Calneva Drive to Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland eastbound leads to the Sepulveda Boulevard tunnel and onto the 
southbound San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, the area of spacious, country-style homes resembled the 
narrow end of a funnel, with cars lined up bumper to bumper on the network of 
side streets leading to the crucial thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mornings we can't get out of our driveway. There are mornings we sit 
in our driveway 10, 15 minutes while a stream of cars goes down the hill. It's 
exasperating," said Natalie Levy, who lives at the corner of two streets that 
are part of one of the busiest routes up to Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said the traffic is not only a nuisance but a danger. 
</P>
<P>
She and other residents cited broken fences and mailboxes, delayed ambulances 
and firetrucks -- and worse -- in a litany of traffic headaches. 
</P>
<P>
On May 19, 1988, at about 6:30 p.m., a commuter's car plowed into the Levys' 
kitchen and supper table just moments before the family sat down for a 
barbecued meal. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously hurt. According to Levy, the driver was taking a shortcut 
to her home in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Five seconds later, we would've been sitting there. Need I say more?" Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Levy, DeAntonio and other activists pleaded not to have the side streets' names 
published for fear of enticing even more commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Some blame the book "LA Shortcuts: The Guidebook for Drivers Who Hate to Wait" 
for exacerbating an existing problem and teaching some motorists a new route, 
DeAntonio said. 
</P>
<P>
But even she acknowledges that the problem has been growing along with 
population in the area.

CHEMICAL BLAZE SENDS 4 FIREFIGHTERS TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sun Valley chemical fire Saturday caused $30,000 in damage and resulted in 
four firefighters undergoing blood tests to determine if they had been injured 
from inhaling toxic fumes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at about 8:30 a.m. at Flamemaster Corp., a company that 
manufactures jet accessories at 11120 Sherman Way, said Pat Marek, a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles city Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which took firefighters about 45 minutes to extinguish, broke out in 
a highly flammable vat of magnesium dioxide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't suspect arson, but we are still investigating the cause," Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The four firefighters were taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center for the 
tests, the results of which had not yet been determined, he said.

JEWELRY STORE ROBBED; 2 MEN CAUGHT, 1 SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank police chased down two men Saturday afternoon suspected of robbing a 
Burbank jewelry store early in the afternoon, but a third suspect, who 
authorities said was shot by an officer while attempting to escape, was still 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Police Lt. Larry Koch said that Krause Jewelers, located at 101 N. 
Victory Boulevard, was robbed by three men armed with a handgun at about 1:40

Store employees phoned police while the men were still in the store, but the 
three robbers fled from the store and into a waiting automobile as police 
arrived, Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
Police chased the car, but after about a mile the suspects got out and started 
running. Using dogs and a helicopter, officers chased and arrested two men, but 
they were still looking for a third. The names of the suspects in custody were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the third man was hit by an officer who fired one shot at him.

JIM MURRAY: THIS DUEL IS AS BITTER AS IT GETS 
</P>

<P>
What would you say was the greatest rivalry in the history of sports? 
Dempsey-Tunney? Yale-Harvard? Notre Dame-USC? Dodgers-Giants? Lendl-Becker? 
</P>
<P>
Not even close. The greatest, longest-running, bitterest enmity in the world of 
sports has to be the NCAA vs. Jerry Tarkanian. For you classicists, the pursuit 
of Jean Valjean by the detective, Javert, in "Les Miserables" is the only thing 
that even comes close. 
</P>
<P>
Take this summer. Jerry Tarkanian was sitting atop the basketball world. His 
University of Nevada Las Vegas team had just won the Final Four, the NCAA's 
World Series of basketball, routing Duke in the final by 30 points. More than 
100,000 people turned out to greet the team on their return home. Tarkanian 
could have run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
They were all set to defend their title this season. Their team was intact. Two 
of the brightest stars had resisted the blandishments of the pros and the 
Italian teams dangling big bucks, and had elected to stay and repeat as 
national champions. 
</P>
<P>
And then the NCAA went into their all-court press. They rained on Tarkanian's 
parade. UNLV was to be placed on probation, barred from taking part in the 
Final Four or any postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because they hadn't gotten rid of their coach 13 years ago when the NCAA 
wanted them to. 
</P>
<P>
It's a complicated story coated with elements of revenge, blood feud and 
uncompromising adversarial relationship that would be comprehensible only to 
the Hatfields and McCoys. 
</P>
<P>
It all began, probably, with that nickname: Tark the Shark. Not Tark the Lark. 
Not Tark the Spark. Not even Tark the Aardvark. No, it conjured images of this 
awful predatory creature of the deep, prowling the basketball seas of the 
world, gobbling up recruits and swallowing them whole. "Jaws" in the locker 
room. Thum-thum-thum-thum. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was the man himself. Tark was not your basic Central Casting idea 
of the beloved old mentor. He did not have this shock of white hair and saintly 
expression. Amos Alonzo Stagg, the grand old man, he was not. When he talked, 
he didn't put you in mind of Ronald Colman. His hoarse croak had /the rhythm of 
the streets in it. This flat-nosed, balding character always looked as if he 
just heard his dog died. He just sat there chewing on this wet towel looking 
for all the world like a guy who wished you would stop beating him up. Someone 
once said of Lute Olson, the Arizona coach with the white hair and the 
postage-stamp profile, that every time he looked at him, he had to resist the 
urge to vote for him. With Tark, you had to resist the urge to ask him what he 
did with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
He was really a gentle, eager-to-please kind of guy, but there was something 
about him that seemed to make the NCAA froth at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
There was his team. It came into focus as a bunch of guys who just rode into 
town on motorcycles. The popular conception was, Tark had to arm-wrestle the 
N.Y.P.D. for them, and if they weren't at UNLV, they'd be at Attica. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't true. Not many of them became doctors, but neither did they become 
serial killers. Besides, a surprising 47% graduated. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible the regulators of the sport were not thrilled to see their No. 1 
team coming out of America's Gomorrah, the neon citadel of sin in some eyes. 
</P>
<P>
To the NCAA, Tark the Shark was more like Moby Dick to their Captain Ahab. It 
was an obsession. It frosted them that a dozen of the best blacktop players in 
the nation annually showed up at UNLV, and they were sure, to a person, that 
the players, once in Vegas, would go straight to the crap tables where they 
would be permitted to help themselves to 20 consecutive passes whenever they 
needed pocket money. The truth was, the casinos were off-limits to any of 
Tarkanian's players, no exceptions, under pain of dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA finally moved on its quarry, the great white Tark, in 1977. They threw 
the book at UNLV, 72 violations, 10 of them involving Tarkanian. They demanded 
the school banish him. 
</P>
<P>
You have to understand an NCAA hearing is not to be confused with the kind of 
courtroom Perry Mason operated in or one where the judges wear powdered wigs. 
They run more to the ones of the Red Queen in "Alice's Adventures in 
Wonderland," where she says: "The execution first, the trial afterwards!" 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian had no trouble getting an injunction against his suspension. The 
university could try to suspend him but, as a state (of Nevada) employee, he 
could argue -- successfully -- that he had been deprived of his livelihood 
without due process of law. He won a permanent injunction. The NCAA suspended 
his team for two years, but Tarkanian remained on. And the case dragged on 
through the courts for 11 years -- at a cost to the NCAA of more than $1 
million -- finally reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
These Solomons really cut the baby in half. They ruled the NCAA, as a voluntary 
organization, had the right to suspend teams and coaches -- Tarkanian was the 
only one they ever had -- but that Tarkanian, as a state employee, could not be 
fired without due process, which NCAA hearings hardly constituted. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA, armed with this affirmation of its imperial powers, decreed this year 
that because UNLV had not dismissed its coach as ordered 13 years ago, it was 
in violation of its charter, and its basketball team was suspended from 
tournament play and thus from defending its title. UNLV protested that it had 
tried to comply, it had tried to dismiss Tarkanian as ordered, but could not 
violate a court order. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA takes the position Tarkanian must be cheating. UNLV takes the position 
it has to abide by the laws of the state of Nevada and the rules of the highest 
court in the land, that it would have been a scofflaw to suspend the coach. 
Tarkanian takes the position he is Joan of Arc, persecuted for excellence. 
</P>
<P>
It's a legal problem only Lewis Carroll's Red Queen would relish. Tarkanian, 
although muttering darkly about "blackmail," has offered to sit out any 
postseason play and relinquish the coaching post for those games -- and only 
those games -- if the team is reinstated. "They are punishing kids who were 
only 7 and 8 years old when the original hearings were held," he protests. The 
NCAA counters that Tarkanian is like the guy who murders his mother and father 
and then pleads for mercy on the grounds he is an orphan. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, it is the greatest manhunt and the bitterest rivalry in 
the annals of games people play. Dempsey-Firpo? A love-in compared to this.

JUST A DAY AT THE CLIPPER CIRCUS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: BO KIMBLE SIGNS HIS CONTRACT AND THEN THE FUN BEGINS AS BOTH 
SIDES ARGUE OVER STATEMENTS MADE EARLIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On the surface, Bo Kimble's one-day holdout ended in expected fashion Saturday 
when Clipper uniform No. 30 was displayed. Coach Mike Schuler talked of how his 
newest player will contribute, and Kimble laughed and smiled for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are past, and what is important now is that Bo is a member of 
the Clipper family, and we're all going to be going out this season watching 
him shoot the lights out," team attorney Bob Steele said. "That's what this is 
about. It is not about two or three months ago. That's old news. It's dead and 
buried." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Problems were still very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
Considering Kimble had already signed the paper work, what happened in a small 
banquet room at a City of Industry hotel was theater of the bizarre. After the 
news conference started 90 minutes late, Kimble's agent Leonard Armato said his 
client would hold out until the Clippers released a statement apologizing for 
harsh comments during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Steele then entered the room and had pointed exchanges with Armato in front of 
several members of the media. Steele said the Clippers had nothing to apologize 
for but, after Armato talked some more about holding out, the team released the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble says he will be in camp today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last thing I thought would happen when I got here," Armato said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a new page of Clipper lore. What could top representatives for the two 
sides be sniping about hours after signing a five-year, $7.25-million contract? 
</P>
<P>
The statement that irritated Armato quoted Steele as saying: "If Leonard Armato 
had proposed at the start a deal at $1.5 million a year and no strange 
provisions, this agreement would have been concluded in 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Armato said Kimble was upset when he read that and wasn't going to come to the 
news conference. "He was very upset. Only after we talked to Bob Steele and he 
agreed to make a statement apologizing did Bo agree to come." 
</P>
<P>
And during the news conference, one couldn't tell that there were problems. 
Kimble said all the right things. He said he was happy to be a Clipper, the 
team he truly hoped would draft him. He looked forward to competing for a 
starting shooting guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't be happier Bo is a Clipper," owner Donald T. Sterling said. "When 
all is said and done, the agreement we reached was fair for everyone and 
everyone can be very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
It was only afterward that Armato spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning Bo picked up the paper and was really disturbed regarding the 
comments made about the negotiations. Bob Steele and the Clipper organization 
promised that if Bo shows up, the Clippers will recant many of the things said 
and tell what really transpired (Friday) and the real tenor of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I will advise Bo not to report until everything is resolved in writing. I 
don't trust that organization anymore. Beyond that, I'm very disappointed. He 
has a contract, yes, but at the same time there were representations made to 
him that have not held true." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers had originally decided against a statement in writing so as to not 
raise the issue. Steele said they did not want to "detract from the moment." 
</P>
<P>
There were also other minor points about tickets for charity. Kimble wanted to 
start a foundation that would allow charity organizations free tickets to 
Clipper games. Armato wanted it in writing, but the Clippers said it wasn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in an impromptu post-news conference, Steele said: "We don't find any 
fault in Bo's representatives making advanced proposals in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
Armato, sitting a few feet away, countered: "Bob, you've said that 16 times. 
Are we getting the press release or not?" 
</P>
<P>
At 4:45 p.m., the circus left town. Kimble, his adviser, David Spencer, and 
Armato got the release. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to clarify for the record that the Clippers at all times considered the 
proposals from Bo's representatives to be advanced in good faith and reasonable 
in NBA negotiations for players of Bo's stature," the statement read in part. 
"We regret if any statements made during negotiations would imply otherwise, 
for we could not be more delighted and excited about Bo's future with the 
Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
Apology accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Armato was particularly upset that the Clippers had characterized some of his 
demands as ludicrous. Specifically, clauses that Kimble would become a 
restricted free agent -- not unrestricted, as team officials had been saying -- 
if he made the all-star team two years in a row and others calling for $100,000 
for making appearances, a $1-million signing bonus and a $1-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever denied those requests were made. Armato said he did not cave in to 
get the deal done Friday and signed Saturday. "You should have seen them (the 
Clippers) groveling this morning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Steele scoffed, but decided not to press the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, Aramto and Spencer, at long last, approved the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's official," Kimble said. "Time to go to work."

SMITH SHOWS A HEART IRREGULARITY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: LAKERS SEND NO. 2 DRAFT PICK BACK TO LOS ANGELES FOR MORE 
TESTS.

<P>
The Lakers said they will send No. 2 draft pick Tony Smith home for more tests 
after his preseason physical showed an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 6-foot-4 guard from Marquette, was supposed to fly to Los Angeles this 
morning and undergo tests at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be one test or it could be two weeks," trainer Gary Vitti said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Mike Dunleavy: "It's funny (because) he's been in a situation at the 
pre-draft camp in Chicago where they went over him with a fine-tooth comb. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the longer someone's out, the more it hurts his chances. In his 
case, he's ahead of schedule. He knows what we're doing here from playing on 
our team in the summer. If it's a 3-4-5 day thing, I don't think it'll hurt. If 
it gets longer than that, he'll miss some conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Smith had been held out of drills the first two days of camp, while the team 
waited for a clarification of his status. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been waiting basically all summer for this to come around," Smith said. 
"Then you've got to sit out a few more days. It's hard to sit there and watch. 
You want to be out there mixing it up with the guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried. I feel fine. Nothing like this has ever happened to me 
before. Something just showed up that they've got to check out." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Larry Drew says this camp feels like "a cloud has been lifted off our 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds as if he's talking about ex-coach Pat Riley, he is. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really a personal thing," Drew said. "The way he ran his ship, I 
just had somewhat of a difficult time adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I was playing tight. I was always looking over my shoulder, getting 
into a ballgame knowing if I made a mistake I was going to be pulled. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, I was coming in for Magic (Johnson). You come in behind the best, 
everyone looks to you, in a sense, to duplicate what he's doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
Did Drew speak with Riley about his confusion? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way, Riley wasn't the kind of guy -- I didn't feel 
comfortable at going up and talking to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, the first time I walked in to Mike Dunleavy's office, he told me he 
understood the predicament (bench) players get caught in. He played that role 
for most of his career. It's important to try and get involved instead of just 
being out there passing the ball. He said he'd try to run a few plays for me. 
Mike's like a player. He's down-to-earth, easy to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
Drew's problem wasn't symptomatic of the entire team, because most other 
players had more clearly-defined roles under Riley. However, Drew says there's 
a general good feeling under Dunleavy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we're looser," he said."

<P>
Stacey Robinson broke an NCAA quarterback rushing record with 308 yards, and 
scored five touchdowns, in Northern Illinois' 73-18 rout of No. 24 Fresno 
State. Robinson broke the record of 294 set by Nolan Cromwell of Kansas against 
Oregon State in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gardocki kicked a school record-tying four field goals, from 47, 25, 30 
and 25 yards, in Clemson's 34-3 victory over Georgia. It was the largest margin 
of victory by Clemson over Georgia since 1905, when the Tigers won, 35-0. 
Clemson's Doug Brewster set up a field goal in the second quarter when he 
blocked Scot Armstrong's punt, the first block against the Bulldogs since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
John Langeloh kicked an extra point in Michigan State's 12-7 loss to Iowa, 
tying him with Morten Andersen as the Spartans' career scoring leader with 261 
points. Langeloh missed field-goal attempts of 19 and 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
David Klingler, the nation's total offense leader, completed 35 of 68 passes 
for 405 yards in Houston's 31-15 Southwest Conference victory over Baylor. 
Klingler was one short of Andre Ware's school and conference record for pass 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi defeated Kentucky, 35-29, for its third consecutive victory and 
improved its record to 4-1, the best start for the Rebels since quarterback 
Archie Manning led the 1970 team to a 4-1 record after five games. The victory 
was Billy Brewer's 100th as a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado State defense made the difference in a 22-13 victory over Utah. 
The Rams sacked Utah quarterback Jason Woods seven times, intercepted three of 
his passes and recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois' 31-20 victory over Ohio State was its third in a row, the first time 
the Illini have beaten the Buckeyes three games in a row since 1927-29. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Doyle's six field goals tied a Southeastern Conference record in 
Alabama's 25-6 victory over Southwestern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Musgrave became Oregon's all-time offense leader in the No. 22 Ducks' 52-7 
victory over Utah State. Musgrave completed 15 of 23 passes for 187 yards and 
increased his career offense total to 6,878 yards. He surpassed the previous 
school record of 6,841 set from 1983-86 by quarterback Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's 48-10 victory over Temple was the Nittany Lions' 16th consecutive 
win over its intrastate rival since the teams played a tie in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Colgate's Dave Goodwin, who passed for three touchdowns in a 30-7 victory over 
Yale, has thrown touchdown passes in nine consecutive games, breaking the 
school record of Steve Calabria set in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's 41-3 victory over Wisconsin was the Wolverines' ninth in a row over 
the Badgers since 1981.

RAMBLING AND WRECKING 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Georgia Tech (4-0) has played aggressive defense all season, but the 
Yellow Jackets outdid even themselves against Atlantic Coast Conference 
opponent Maryland in a 31-3 victory. The Georgia Tech defense, which has not 
allowed a touchdown this season, sacked quarterback Scott Zolak seven times in 
the first half and 11 times in the game, bringing the four-game total to 23 
sacks and 12 interceptions. Zolak, sacked for losses totaling 65 yards, passed 
for 192 yards, almost 100 yards below his average, was intercepted once and was 
removed in the fourth quarter. Georgia Tech has won 11 of 12 and eight in a 
row.

BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Vardell's fourth one-yard touchdown run, with 36 seconds left, gave 
Stanford a 36-31 victory over No. 1 Notre Dame. Quarterback Jason Palumbis kept 
the Cardinal's game-winning drive alive when he ran for two yards and a first 
down on a fourth-down play. The victory was Stanford's first over Notre Dame 
since a 24-14 win at Palo Alto, Calif., in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Von Wyl's third field goal, a 30-yarder with three seconds remaining, gave 
No. 5 Auburn a 16-14 victory over Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Shudak's 53-yard field goal with 18 seconds left gave Iowa State a 34-34 
tie with Kansas. Shudak became Iowa State's career kick-scoring leader with 222 
points, breaking the mark of 214 points set by Alex Giffords from 1979-82. Iowa 
State's all-time scoring leader is Dexter Green with 228 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma's freshman quarterback, Cale Gundy, came off the bench and completed a 
52-yard pass play to Adrian Cooper as time ran out in the first half to bring 
the Sooners into a 14-14 tie. Oklahoma went on to win, 31-17. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa linebacker Melvin Foster had 20 tackles, an interception that the Hawkeyes 
turned into a touchdown and made a key fourth-down stop in the fourth quarter 
in a 12-7 victory over Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green, on running back Tommy Vardell, who scored on four 
one-yard touchdown runs in the Cardinal's 36-31 upset of No. 1 Notre Dame: "We 
call number 44 Touchdown Tommy. We know he's going to get the ball, you know 
he's going to get the ball, and we want to see you try to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz: "I don't know if I've ever been in a loss this 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Maryland Coach Joe Krivak, on the 31-3 loss to Georgia Tech: "That is as 
probably as good a licking as we have taken all season. I think it was in every 
phase of the game. They ran the ball, they threw when they wanted to and we 
couldn't handle their pass rush." 
</P>
<P>
Houston's David Klingler, after completing 35 of 68 passes in a 31-15 victory 
over Baylor: "I throw 300 balls a day and this was a good warmup for me. Still 
I was dragging there late. I was hoping I'd get hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech linebacker Myron Baker, after a 16-14 loss to Auburn: "It's hard 
to tell how good Auburn is, but if they're a top-five team then we should be 
right behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Coach Ray Goff, after a 34-3 loss to Clemson: "I don't think I could 
tell you all my feelings right now. Obviously, I am disappointed. We just got 
whipped. You can write all the ifs, ands or buts you want, but the bottom line 
is that Clemson lined up and whipped us."

GIVE 'EM FIVE 
</P>
<P>
From the "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try, try, try again 
department: Colorado, ranked No. 12, avoided an upset by Missouri, 33-31, 
scoring on the last play of the game. And on fifth down. 
</P>
<P>
The final sequence, according to the official play by play, was an incomplete 
pass on first down, a short run on second, no gain on a run on third and 
another incomplete pass on fourth. Fourth down, Part II: Charles Johnson runs 
into the end zone. Seems everyone forgot about the first incomplete pass. By 
the time everyone realized that Missouri had been Buffaloed, it was too late. 
Officials said they could not reverse the decision once the play had taken 
place. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT I MEANT WAS... 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Buckley, a sophomore cornerback for previously undefeated Florida 
State, dismissed the talents of Miami quarterback Craig Erickson when 
interviewed before the CBS telecast of Miami's 31-22 victory. Buckley said he 
hadn't seen anything in Erickson's performance that would qualify him as a 
Heisman Trophy candidate and said he considered the Miami quarterback only an 
"average" player. Good thing for Buckley Erickson's an only average 
quarterback. Erickson passed to Buckley's side with effectiveness, including a 
10-yard scorig pass to Lamar Thomas in the second quarter on which Buckley was 
beaten by at least a couple of steps.

Army running back Willie McMillian left the game against Duke in the fourth 
quarter with a pulled right hamstring.

KIECKER HOPES TO PAY STEINBACH A STRIKEOUT

<P>
The Red Sox are looking for Dana Kiecker to deliver a victory tonight when he 
opposes Bob Welch in Game 2 of the American League playoffs. A few months ago, 
all Kiecker delivered was packages. 
</P>
<P>
While back home in Minnesota last winter, Kiecker supplemented his minor league 
salary by working as a package car driver for UPS in Minneapolis. "You know, 
the men in brown," said Kiecker, a native of Sleepy Eye, Minn. "You always see 
them tooting around, rushing like maniacs." 
</P>
<P>
While he was delivering packages during the pre-Christmas rush and mulling his 
baseball future after having spent 6 1/2 years in the minors, Kiecker managed 
to fit in some workouts with an old friend, A's catcher Terry Steinbach, of New 
Ulm, Minn. Steinbach not only helped keep Kiecker in shape, he helped keep his 
hopes up. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a pretty strenuous schedule when I was working for UPS, and I was having 
trouble finding a place to work out," said Kiecker, who was 8-12 for St. Cloud 
(Minn.) State University and 56-66 in the minors. He surpassed .500 only in 
1983, when he was 11-5 at Class A Elmira. 
</P>
<P>
"He opened up his time to fit my time. It was a friendship that took off into a 
working relationship," Kiecker said. "But I know every time he comes up (in the 
playoffs), he'll be trying to get a hit, and I'll be trying to strike him out. 
He definitely helped me improve a little more so I could make the club this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old right-hander was 8-9 with a 3.97 earned-run average for the Red 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Welch, whose previous high in victories was 17, attributed his 27-6 record 
this season to the A's overall success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing on a team that's been consistent," he said. "There's situation 
where you pitch pretty good, and you might get a no-decision and the team comes 
back and gets a run for you. We've also played excellent defense through the 
course of the year. That's important, because a guy like me isn't going to go 
out and strike out eight, nine, 10 men a game." 
</P>
<P>
A's pitching coach Dave Duncan said Welch succeeded spectacularly after he 
learned to stop overthrowing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets into a power mode when he tries to jump from the mound to the catcher 
and hand the ball to him," Duncan said. "He was rushing his delivery. . . . He 
had to understand that it would be detrimental to him." 
</P>
<P>
Although Welch won five more games than Dave Stewart, Welch said he had no 
quarrel with Manager Tony La Russa's decision to start Stewart in the series 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" Welch said. "Since I've been here, Stew's been the foundation of the 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Should Roger Clemens have no shoulder discomfort after pitching Saturday -- and 
should the series go that long -- it's possible Clemens could pitch three 
times, in Games 1, 4 and 7. The Red Sox had said they will be cautious with 
Clemens, and Manager Joe Morgan has said he plans to start Greg Harris in Game 
4 in Oakland Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gallego returned from dinner Friday night and found a voice message from 
La Russa on his hotel room phone. Said La Russa: "You've got the ball. Put on 
your psych face." 
</P>
<P>
It was La Russa's way of telling Gallego that he would start ahead of Willie 
Randolph at second base in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
Gallego is considered the better defensive player but hit .206 compared to 
Randolph's overall .257 and .303 average in the final 35 games. LaRussa said he 
felt the A's could win with either player. 
</P>
<P>
"This is blown out of proportion because of the playoffs, but Willie and I have 
gone through it all year," said Gallego, who lives in Yorba Linda. "It's 
always, 'will it be me or will it be Willie?' I came out on top tonight, but 
we'll face that question again tomorrow. The way I feel about it, how can you 
make a wrong decision?" 
</P>
<P>
The A's reached the postseason roster limit of 25 players by removing pitcher 
Reggie Harris and outfielder Darren Lewis.

AS USUAL, A'S STEWART IS UNUSUALLY SUPERB;

A'S: OAKLAND PITCHER DOMINATES THE RED SOX AND INVITES ANYBODY TO FIND SOMEONE

The facts speak for themselves. If they don't, Dave Stewart spoke with even 
greater clarity. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need Roger Clemens in or out of the game to have a chance to win when 
I'm pitching," Stewart said Saturday night after he and his Oakland Athletics 
proved it again. 
</P>
<P>
The A's routed the Boston Red Sox, 9-1, in Game 1 of the American League 
playoffs as Stewart outlasted the tiring Clemens and gave up only four hits in 
a characteristic eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
The A's ace is 7-1 in confrontations with Clemens, 4-0 for his career in 
playoff competition and 23-11 overall in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristic, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Stew was good tonight, but he's good a high percentage of the time," A's 
pitching coach Dave Duncan said. "It was a Dave Stewart-type game. I mean, if 
he was better in any one area than he normally is I guess it would be that he 
had exceptional control. He was able to go to either side of the plate whenever 
he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stewart, the first pitcher since Jim Palmer (1975-78) to win 20 or more 
games in four consecutive seasons: "This is the way I've pitched the last four 
years. I had everything working. Good fastball. Hard slider. I was able to 
establish the inside part of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, people talk about my playoff record, but I was 5-0 in September before 
losing my last start, 2-0. I've pitched well for a month. I've pitched well for 
four years. You look around at the pitchers in the league, and who else has 
done what I did? Nobody but me. The thing that made this year better than the 
other three is that I had to work so much harder because the opposition was 
more geared to what I was throwing." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but the Red Sox are 0-4 against Stewart this year and 5-12 for his 
career. He gave up a fourth-inning homer by Wade Boggs, struck out three and 
walked one. He retired nine of the last 10 batters he faced before Dennis 
Eckersley pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, making only his second start after going 25 days between appearances 
because of biceps tendinitis, worked six shutout innings. He gave up four hits 
before the relievers turned the game into another Boston massacre, as they 
almost did last Saturday when he returned from his long layoff to pitch six 
shutout innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Red Sox hanging on then for 
a 7-5 win. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has talked about a tension when he and Clemens are in proximity, but 
Saturday night he said: "Each time I pitch against him I have more respect for 
him. I mean, for what he came into the game with tonight, I thought he was 
superb. I don't think he's still 100%. A healthy Clemens goes hard from the 
first inning to the ninth, but I still don't think he would have beaten us, 
1-0. It may not have been 9-1, but I don't think it would have been 1-0." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens was hurt Sept. 4 while pitching against Stewart. Some of the Red Sox 
believe he was overthrowing that day, obsessed with the goal of finally beating 
his nemesis. The Red Sox themselves seemed obsessed with winning Game 1 behind 
their ace. They viewed it as a win they had to have if they are going avoid a 
repeat of the 1988 sweep by Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't put as much emphasis on it as the Red Sox seemed to," Stewart said. 
"I read where they said they had to beat me to win the series. It didn't put 
any pressure on me, but I thought it put too much pressure on Clemens. It was 
as if they were saying, 'We might not be worth a darn in the next three games 
if Roger doesn't beat Stewart.' Heck, I was just trying to keep us in the game, 
pitch my normal game. I mean, I wasn't facing Roger Clemens, I was facing the 
Boston Red Sox hitters." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, disposing of them as he does just about all hitters.

<P>
His eyes smoldering with resentment, the sinews in his neck stretched taught, 
Barry Bonds sat in front of his locker Saturday glaring straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Pittsburgh Pirate left fielder's teammates already had left for the 
day, but he cursed that not all of the reporters had done the same. 
</P>
<P>
He is 26, an age where most players still relish the opportunity for attention, 
striving to become a celebrity. But this is Barry Lamar Bonds. This is a man 
whose college coach, Jim Brock of Arizona State, called him, "rude, 
inconsiderate and self-centered." 
</P>
<P>
His strained relationship with reporters is such that in a year when he should 
be a shoo-in for the National League's most valuable player award, Bonds openly 
wonders if it will cost him such a glorious honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'm perceived as being and that's why I think I won't be voted the 
MVP," Bonds said. "If the writers don't like you, they're not going to vote 
you. That'll be their punishment, their payback. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll give it to Bobby (teammate Bobby Bonilla), or someone who gets along 
with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bonds is an angry man. He's angry at reporters for bothering him. He's angry at 
the Pirates for taking him to arbitration a year ago, and beating him. But most 
of all, he's angry at history. 
</P>
<P>
What he's doing, some say, is fighting the battles that his father endured. 
Bobby Bonds, remember, was going to be the next Willie Mays. He was supposed to 
hit more home runs, steal more bases, and win more championships. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds wound up being a three-time All-Star, but he played for seven teams. He 
was a 30-30 man five times, hitting 30 homers and stealing 30 bases in a 
season, a feat only twice achieved by Mays. But Mays hit 40 or more home runs 
six times; Bonds never hit more than 39. Mays finished with 660 homers; Bonds 
had 328. Mays is in the Hall of Fame; Bonds is not. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is why Bobby Bonds feels justified in saying: "I know exactly what 
my son's going through, because I went through the same damn thing myself. 
</P>
<P>
"They said I was supposed to be the next Willie Mays. When they told me that, 
it was an honor. You're talking about a guy who I considered the greatest 
player to ever wear shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably had more success than anyone they ever put that label on. You show 
me another guy who's going to do 30-30 five times. I know I sure haven't met 
him yet. 
</P>
<P>
"But all the writers kept talking about was potential. You haven't reached your 
potential, they say. Well, unless you win a Pulitzer Prize, you're not living 
up to your potential either, are you? 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I see it again. I tell you what you're doing, you're destroying a young 
ballplayer. You don't realize what you're doing, but you're putting him in a 
position to fail. He did 30-30 once, and they'll expect him to do it again next 
year. And the year after that. 
</P>
<P>
"And when he doesn't, he'll be called a failure." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me how fair that is." 
</P>
<P>
It indeed was a season produced by Barry Bonds considered among the all-around 
finest in the game. He batted .301. He hit 33 homers. He drove in 114 runs. And 
he stole 52 bases. 
</P>
<P>
No one had ever batted .300, with 30 homers, 100 RBIs and 50 stolen bases in 
the same season. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, instead of savoring his accomplishments, Barry Bonds said: "I already 
know what's going to happen next year. Everyone's going to ask, 'Is he going to 
do what his father did? Can he be a part of history?' That's bull, man, and I 
don't want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of competing against his father's accomplishments, Barry Bonds yearns 
for the baseball world to atone for what he believes is an injustice toward 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all this talk about Ken Griffey Jr. and his father, and the Ripkens," 
Barry Bonds said, "but they haven't done anything compared to us. It's crazy, 
it's almost like my father is finally getting recognition now because of my 
accomplishments, and that hurts me. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad is regarded as one of the greatest players in the game. He should be in 
the Hall of Fame. What Ken Griffey's done, what Cal Ripken's done, that's 
nothing. We're in the history books, man, for the first father-son to crack 
30-30. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I don't even want to be a part of this. I don't want to 
interviewed. I don't want to be on TV. I just want to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
"They never did my dad right, they never gave him the respect he deserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I believe things will be any different with me?" 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pirate Manager Jim Leyland, sitting alone in his office for several minutes 
after the workout, confessed that he was quite despondent, trying to battle his 
emotions. "I'm trying not to let it show, but this day is hard for me," he 
said. "You see, this is the one-year anniversary of the day our (stillborn) 
baby died, and it's a tough memory. My wife's at a wedding today, so hopefully, 
that'll cheer her up. But when I think of that, and the fact that my father 
died last year, too, everything just kind of hits you at once. I don't want to 
talk about it, because the memory is tough enough." 
</P>
<P>
Just how loose was the Reds' workout Saturday? Reliever Norm Charlton's 
Labrador retrieved baseballs during the 90-minute workout. "We've been this way 
all year," he said. "Why should we change now?" . . . The Pirates, sharing the 
field at Three Rivers Stadium with the Steelers, were equally as relaxed during 
their hour-long workout, with Barry Bonds even seen throwing passes with a few 
players. "The Steelers were great," Leyland said. "This is a long way from '86, 
when people could care less about us. I remember trying to get on golf courses, 
saying we'd give them an autographed ball. Well, they'd let us on the course, 
but nobody wanted our autograph." 
</P>
<P>
Red outfielder Eric Davis will start in center field Monday for the first time 
since Aug. 24, enabling Manager Lou Piniella to keep Paul O'Neill in the 
lineup. "With the way he's swinging (.429, three RBIs)," Piniella said, "we'd 
be crazy not to have him in there." . . . Pirate catcher Mike LaValliere, upset 
with the location of the players wives' seats in Cincinnati, chastised Red 
owner Marge Schott, saying: "She's is the cheapest person I've ever met in the 
game of baseball. We had our wives here, and we had to use binoculars to see 
them in their seats, and they had to do the same to see the game."

MIKE FARIA WINS FIRST U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Speedway motorcyclist Mike Faria ended 12 years of frustration by winning the 
22nd U.S. Championship Saturday night before 8,790 at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The victory for Faria didn't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
He defeated Alan Christian in a four-lap runoff after both riders had tied for 
first with 13 points following five heat races. 
</P>
<P>
Faria won a coin toss and elected to start on the inside from the second gate 
with Christian starting from the fourth gate. Faria took the lead on the first 
turn and never looked back to cap a successful three-week run. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Faria won the state championship at San Bernardino and the track 
championship at Ascot Park, but he had always been labeled as a rider who 
couldn't win the big race. 
</P>
<P>
Faria got a big assist from third-place finisher Billy Hamill in the final heat 
of the night. Hamill defeated Christian to force the runoff, but it took two 
restarts to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Christian was bidding to win his second national title in his 20-year career 
but lost in the fourth runoff for the championship in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
The program ended just the way it started with two runoffs in a very 
competitive night of racing. In the first heat, defending U.S. champion Bobby 
Schwartz crashed, restarted and collided with Steve Lucero, then restarted and 
collided with Josh Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
The program was delayed when a member of a parachute demonstration team landed 
into the starting tapes.

AGOURA GIRLS' TEAM DOMINATES STAUB CROSS-COUNTRY MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Calculators were not necessary to determine the outcome of the Division I 
girls' race in the Kenny Staub Invitational cross-country meet Saturday 
morning. The result was visible to the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura placed five runners among the first eight finishers, easily beating 
Palos Verdes, 19-38, at Crescenta Valley Park. The loss is Palos Verdes' second 
this fall after three consecutive undefeated seasons. Agoura also was 
responsible for the first defeat, beating the Sea Kings three weeks ago in the 
Woodbridge Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill (96), Simi Valley (117) and Redlands (125) rounded out the top 
five. 
</P>
<P>
"They really surprised me today," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said of his Chargers. 
"They knew what they had to do today and they executed it beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by the 1-2-3 finish of Deena Drossin, Tiffany York and Kristy Camp, 
Agoura combined for a meet-record team time of 94 minutes 33 seconds, knocking 
16 seconds off the mark set in 1981 by Santa Ana Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The finish resembled an Agoura-Palos Verdes dual meet more than an invitational 
race. Six Agoura runners placed in the top 10, with the remaining four spots 
filled by Palos Verdes runners. Simi Valley's Lori Church (11th) was the 
highest-placing runner from another school. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin's bid for her third course record of the season took a turn for the 
worse with a half-mile left in the three-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
The defending state Division I champion won in 17:42, but a wrong turn added 
almost 50 yards to Drossin's race. Had she stayed on course, she might have 
broken the course mark of 17:31. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' Division I race, Ben Mesfen of Venice remained undefeated, winning 
in 15:27. Agoura's Ryan Wilson was second in 15:43. Hoover claimed the team 
title over Palos Verdes, 58-71, behind the third-place effort of Margarito 
Casillas (15:52). 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wilson (15:50) of Newbury Park and Westlake's Jeannie Rothman (17:55) won 
the Division II boys' and girls' individual titles. Thousand Oaks scored 111 
points to take the boys' Division II team title and Claremont edged Westlake, 
71-74, for the girls' championship. 
</P>
<P>
Illnesses and ineligibility hampered defending City Section champion Taft, 
which finished a distant fifth in the Division I race. The Toreadors were 
running without Jim Gough, a transfer from Toronto, who is on the 10-week 
ineligible list because of transcript problems.

SWINTON LEADS MONTCLAIR PREP TO 35-13 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Who needs Derek Sparks anyway? 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, against St. Genevieve High, sophomore Eliel Swinton was up 
to the task of carrying Montclair Prep to a 35-13 nonleague victory at 
Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
With Sparks, the Times' Valley-area Back of the Year for Montclair Prep last 
season, having gone to Santa Ana Mater Dei, Swinton filled in by rushing for 
217 yards and four touchdowns in 21 carries as the Mounties scored 35 
unanswered points to overcome a 13-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep improved to 2-3 while St. Genevieve fell to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no loss of poise after we fell behind," Coach George Giannini said. "It 
was just one of those games where we struggled for awhile before we got going." 
</P>
<P>
Swinton, the brother of Washington State running back Rich Swinton, got going 
in the third quarter. He finished with 156 rushing yards in the second half, 
including scoring runs of 67, 30 and 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve took a 6-0 lead midway through the first quarter when Bobby Kite 
threw a short pass to Cary Iaccino, who pitched to Mike Mirolla. Mirolla then 
raced 29 yards down the left sideline for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Kite connected with Tom Nickels on a 12-yard pass in the second quarter to cap 
a four-play, 64-yard drive. Nickels kicked the extra point to increase St. 
Genevieve's advantage to 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who completed four of eight passes for 86 yards, left midway through the 
second quarter after injuring his left elbow. He did not return and neither did 
the St. Genevieve offense. 
</P>
<P>
After Kite's departure, St. Genevieve was able to muster just 57 additional 
yards of total offense.

Moorpark 20, L.A. Southwest 7 -- Freddie Bradley rushed for 154 yards on 22 
carries and scored all three Moorpark touchdowns in a Western State Conference 
game at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley scored on runs of one, six and 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (4-0, 3-0) ran the ball on 45 of its 62 offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (1-3, 0-3) quarterback Craig Manigo, who completed 14 of 31 passes 
for 189 yards, hit Robert Avery with a 30-yard touchdown pass to cut Moorpark's 
lead to 14-7 in the fourth quarter. But Bradley scored his final touchdown to 
secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bradley sets them apart from everyone else," Southwest Coach Henry 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark has a showdown next week against Bakersfield, which is also 
undefeated.

MOORPARK'S WIN SETS UP SHOWDOWN AT BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It hardly seems possible that anyone could look forward to a trip to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
On the entertainment scale, that trip ranks somewhere between a journey to 
Barstow and a weekend in Fresno. But Moorpark College's football players 
nonetheless may have had Bakersfield on their minds Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, looking to set the stage for a battle of unbeatens this week against 
Bakersfield, turned in a cautious, workmanlike, 20-7 win over L. A. Southwest 
in a Western State Conference game at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark defense put together a bend-but-not-break performance that kept 
Southwest out of the end zone until the fourth quarter. On offense, Coach Jim 
Bittner turned the ball over to his groundhog running backs on 45 of Moorpark's 
62 plays. 
</P>
<P>
The game was not decided until the final quarter, yet it seemed over at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively we just got a little too conservative," Bittner said. "To us, 
everything was at stake. We wanted to go into Bakersfield undefeated, and this 
game could have been a real stumbling block." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Freddie Bradley was MC's hammer, rushing for 154 yards in 22 carries 
and scoring all three Moorpark touchdowns -- on runs of one, 58 and six yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bradley sets them apart from everyone else," Southwest Coach Henry 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley opened the scoring with a one-yard plunge late in the first quarter, 
completing a 12-play, 75-yard drive on Moorpark's first possession. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley scored again midway through the second quarter when he ran 58 yards 
north by Southwest. Bradley broke into the secondary, cut right and fended off 
a Southwest defender with a straight arm to clear the way into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (1-3, 0-3 in WSC play) closed the gap early in the fourth quarter. 
Quarterback Craig Manigo, who completed 14 of 31 passes for 189 yards, hit 
Robert Avery with a 30-yard touchdown pass. The conversion made it 14-7, but 
Moorpark (4-0, 3-0) iced the game on its next possession. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley began the drive with a 27-yard run, caught a 17-yard pass from Del 
Marine on a third-and-11 play, then scored from six yards. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Johnel Turner rushed for 44 yards in nine carries and Jamal Anderson 
added 42 in six. Anderson did not start and played sparingly because, Bittner 
said, the coaches were trying to give more backs an opportunity to play. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Dutra completed three of four passes for 52 yards, and Marine completed 
five of 10 for 90 yards.

Bakersfield 62, Ventura 20 -- Sophomore Shon Ellerbe rushed for 209 yards and 
four touchdowns to lead Bakersfield (4-0, 3-0) in a WSC game at Larrabee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (0-4, 0-2) rushed for only 36 yards in 20 first-half carries. The 
Renegades totaled 333 yards in 37 carries en route to a 41-6 halftime bulge. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura played inspired defense in the first quarter and trailed 
Bakersfield, 7-6, after quarterback Tim Albrent tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass 
to wide receiver Chris Thomas on the second play of the second quarter. PAUL

JUDAISM: A FORMER ATHEIST WHO IS NOW A RABBI MAKES THE CASE FOR HOW GOD 
MATTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When David J. Wolpe, a self-confessed ex-atheist, tells Jewish groups that God 
is Love, "I can see the shivers, palpable, running through them," he says. 
"They think that Jimmy Swaggart came to speak." 
</P>
<P>
While Wolpe is hardly a stem-winding preacher of the Louisiana school, his 
message can come as a shock to audiences who expect a rabbi to talk about 
politics, ethics, ancient history and foreign affairs -- anything but God. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in a Judaism that didn't emphasize God at all," said Wolpe, 32, 
director of the library and a lecturer at the University of Judaism on 
Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But his recent book, "The Healer of Shattered Hearts: The Jewish View of God," 
quotes the Bible and the fables of the ancient rabbis (God braiding Eve's hair 
before her marriage to Adam, for example) to make a case that "the idea of God 
addresses the central questions of human life." 
</P>
<P>
A rabbi and the son of a rabbi, Wolpe said he wrote the book "not to prove God 
to people, but to show that it mattered." 
</P>
<P>
He was surprised by the response, which included a post card from "a woman in 
New Jersey who said that she'd seen God and that He looks like (British actor) 
Basil Rathbone." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, "some of them were missionary letters but a lot of them were from 
perplexed and anguished people who want a comforting vision of God, and some of 
the letters were from Christians who were surprised to find it in Judaism," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lack of reviews in mainstream newspapers or magazines, the 192-page 
book, whose title comes from Psalms, has gone into a relatively uncommon fourth 
printing, said Greg Hamlin, vice president for sales and marketing at publisher 
Henry Holt &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
And despite Wolpe's links to the Conservative wing of Judaism, Rabbi Abner 
Weiss of the smaller more strictly observant Orthodox movement recommended the 
book to his Beverly Hills congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Weiss said. "There seems to be a spiritual searching and he deals 
with that problem. He mediates the search for other people. And more than that, 
he also is gifted with a very facile pen. . . . He is able to look at sources 
which are well-known and draw new insights from them." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on the teachings of rabbis who argued 1,800 years ago, Wolpe said that 
English often poses a barrier when he talks about the ideas that were 
formulated in Hebrew and Aramaic, a related Semitic language. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, English is not a Jewish language," he said. "When you say God is Love, 
it has Christian overtones." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he said, many Jews have an idea of God as "very harsh," but he blamed 
that on distinctions drawn by Christian theologians. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know yourself, you open yourself up for others to define you and 
you'll believe them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to draw out the side that Jews don't always see, the God of Love. It 
says that explicitly over and over again in the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
It was not until he was well into his studies at rabbinical school that he 
found his own belief, said Wolpe, who is now working on a Ph.D. in Jewish 
history at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Addicted" in his high school years in Philadelphia to Bertrand Russell's 
arguments for atheism, Wolpe remembers his surprise when a rabbinical colleague 
of his father's said he was glad to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I would rather you grew out of him than grew into him,' and it was a 
great line," Wolpe said. "And it proved to be true. That's exactly what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The change came after a year of Hebrew teaching, political speech-writing and 
rejection slips as he tried to establish himself as a writer after graduating 
from the University of Pennsylvania, Wolpe said. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that he spoke with Elliot Dorff, provost and professor of 
philosophy at the University of Judaism, who says he spotted Wolpe's 
"sensitivity about the human situation . . . his real knack for articulating 
that and drawing it out," and acted as a sort of clerical recruiter. "So we 
talked it out, and I tried to show him that his interest and his talents were 
something that he could accommodate in the rabbinate," Dorff said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, "it wasn't a sudden conversion . . . I didn't fall off my horse," 
Wolpe said. "It was being surrounded by people and texts and an atmosphere of 
concern about God that made me take it seriously . . . it was very much like 
learning a language. There was no one point where all of a sudden you say, 'Ah. 
I can speak now.' " 
</P>
<P>
While he praised "The Healer of Shattered Hearts" in a recent review for a 
Jewish magazine, Dorff said he had his problems with it because "it's not an 
intellectually neat book." 
</P>
<P>
"If you describe God in personal terms, you're in effect limiting God," Dorff 
said. "But if you say that God does not have personality, then you lose the 
heart of Judaism. The Bible describes a God who does have anger, and so on. So 
it's a question of how to have your cake and eat it too. David mentions the 
issue but he doesn't really deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, Wolpe was not really out to solve that problem. "It does speak 
to people, and that's what it's intended to do," he said of the book. "It's for 
lay people who don't generally read Jewish theology and, as such, it's a very 
good introduction."

DUELING LAWSUITS OVER DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is depressing food for thought after reading the latest article on dueling 
lawsuits between the understanding members of the Los Angeles City Council and 
the caring members of the Culver City City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't they ask the hundreds of residents who live within a mile of the 
Marina Place Project and the Channel Gateway Project how they feel about these 
projects? Ask the parents of small children about the increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the elderly who are worried about crime. Ask the healthy and not-so-healthy 
about air pollution. Ask the city about sanitation problems. 
</P>
<P>
This is quite sad, isn't it? The ones who fought the hardest for the welfare of 
their neighborhood can only idly stand by and watch as our faithful politicians 
hold grudge matches against each other. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't the bottom line who is going to reap all the revenues? I think we know 
who is going to benefit the least!

CITY ATTY. MYERS IS 'COMPETENT, DECENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend Julio Moran on his article "Political Brawl Over Homeless," Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
He did an excellent job of describing the situation in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
As a 14-year resident, I would like to add my own observation about City Atty. 
Robert Myers. He is a very competent attorney and a person who behaves in a 
strikingly decent manner which transcends politics. He has always put his 
reputation where his beliefs are. One cannot help but admire such an 
individual. There are few in public office.

PEOPLE: PRIZE-WINNING APPLE PIE WAS 35 YEARS IN THE MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lola Mefferd of Bellflower baked the best apple pie in the state this year, 
according to judges at the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Mefferd was declared the 1990 blue-ribbon winner last month over 95 other 
apple-pie entries in the American Pie Celebration contest. She won an 
expense-paid trip for two and a chance to represent California in the national 
finals in New Orleans next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still four feet off the ground," she said. "It was such a pleasant day. 
Everything just fell into place." 
</P>
<P>
Mefferd said she and her husband, Richard, also celebrated their 38th wedding 
anniversary Sept. 16, the day she won. 
</P>
<P>
"I was also elated I won in Pomona, which is the city where I was born," said 
Mefferd, 56. 
</P>
<P>
Mefferd has been entering baking contests at the fair for more than 35 years 
and has more than 100 ribbons and awards for her cooking. But this is the first 
time she has won the big prize. 
</P>
<P>
Mable Harris, 72, who has been judging pies, cakes and pickles for the last 46 
years at the fair, said Mefferd's entry "was just a perfect pie. It was not too 
tart nor too sweet. It was very attractive, and it tasted good." 
</P>
<P>
Harris also gave Mefferd marks for originality. The golden crust of the 10-inch 
pie was shaped like leaf petals. There was just the right combination of sugar 
and spices, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
At the national Pie Bake Off contest, sponsored by Crisco, Mefferd will pit her 
apple pie against varied pastries, including cherry, pecan and meat pies. "I 
get nervous just thinking about it," said Mefferd, a receptionist for Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
But she need not fret, because she will be accompanied by her best critic and 
supporter, her husband. "I always taste her food and tell her just how I feel 
about it," said Richard Mefferd, 59, a mechanical engineer. "I knew her apple 
pie would win. It was just right." 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower City Council members also know a good pie when they taste one. After 
she won, the council invited Mefferd to a meeting to receive a plaque in honor 
of her achievement. 
</P>
<P>
She baked an apple pie for the council, and they ate it all. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Thill, 12, of Long Beach was recently chosen to dance with the New 
York City Ballet at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.

Thill was one of four girls selected to dance with the company during last 
month's performance of George Balanchine's ballet "Mozartiana." Sixty-two 
dancers auditioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really excited. I never auditioned for anything," said Thill, who is a 
seventh-grader at Hughes Middle School in Long Beach. She also is a student at 
the Ballet Arts Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Santa Fe Springs resident Glen Bartunek will be inducted into the

track in 1935-41. 
</P>
<P>
Bartunek and his wife, Ann, 74, will attend the college's football game 
Saturday against New Mexico Highlands University. 
</P>
<P>
The couple moved to Santa Fe Springs in 1952. Ann was one of the civic leaders 
who helped incorporate the city in 1957. 
</P>

RIDING ATOP AN ELEPHANT IN JUNGLES OF THAILAND MAY TURN OUT TO BE A NARROWING 
EXPERIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
THAILAND: ELEPHANT RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARNABY CONRAD, Conrad is a free-lance writer living in Carpinteria, Calif., 
and author of 24 books, the most recent of which is Hemingway's Spain 
(Chronicle Books, 1990). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up ahead of us on the narrow jungle path were two trees that were so close 
together, I knew our elephant could never squeeze through. The howdah, or seat, 
we clung to stuck out two feet on each side of the behemoth. The trees would 
clip the howdah, my wife would fall insensible to the ground on the right side 
and I would do likewise on the left. 
</P>
<P>
Our young mahout, sitting serenely ahead of us behind the animal's ears, seemed 
oblivious to the approaching mayhem. And why not? The passageway through the 
two trees was big enough for the elephant and him -- it was just we on the wide 
howdah who would pay the terrible price of the misjudgment. 
</P>
<P>
As we came closer to the trees, the mahout held his anka at the ready but did 
not use it. He urged his mount on with his bare knees under the animal's floppy 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
There was simply no way that the broad platform we were sitting on could get 
through that opening. My wife grabbed my hand. The elephant slowed his pace and 
stopped. Carefully, he felt the trees' trunks, measuring the distance with his 
own trunk, mentally adding four feet to his own width. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with about three inches grace on either side of the howdah, he stepped 
carefully through the gap and lumbered his immensity down the path. We breathed 
again, and never again for the two-mile ride did we worry, even when we forded 
a stream and climbed up the steep bank on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
This was just one example we saw that day in Thailand that proved that the 
pachyderm is one of the smartest creatures alive, quite capable of the highest 
type of reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
We were not on any kind of exclusive safari. We were doing what any tourist to 
Chiang Mai can experience by paying less than $50 for two. 
</P>
<P>
I recommend it for anyone of any age. Your hotel concierge can arrange the 
experience for you. Make a day of it -- visit the hill tribes in the morning, 
have a good lunch at the nearby restaurant, then climb to the top of the hill 
and sign up for the elephant ride. 
</P>
<P>
In a few moments you are ascending the steps to the platform that puts you on a 
level with your elephant. Then you are in the howdah and your Kiplingesque 
adventure begins. The jaunt lasts a little over an hour and you go through a 
beautiful jungly forest. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward you get to watch as your elephant is scrubbed and bathed in the 
river. The best part is seeing how the animals are trained for their intricate 
and essential lifetime tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Although elephants have become a tourist attraction, these superbly schooled 
creatures do not exist primarily to do circus tricks for the benefit of the 
growing Thailand tourist trade. They are there to work, and they are very 
important to the Thai economy. 
</P>
<P>
No machine has been able to surpass or even equal the elephant as a skilled 
worker in the teak forests of Thailand; the northern forests are too rough, 
dense and steep for heavy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the extraction of the logs is a selective process, and the amazing 
animals can maneuver the smallest of trails, whereas the machines would need 
large roads necessitating more environmental destruction. 
</P>
<P>
While each elephant requires about 450 pounds of leaves and bananas and 45 
gallons of water daily, that fuel is cheaper and more readily available than 
gasoline and diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
And the elephants more than pay for themselves. (A good one is worth about 
$6,000, which is a lot of money in Thailand.) An adult elephant can lift a log 
weighing almost a ton, and can drag a two-ton tree. 
</P>
<P>
It is fascinating to watch the young elephants being trained at Lampang and the 
various other schools near Chiang Mai. 
</P>
<P>
The training begins when the elephant is 3 to 5 years old, and takes 5 to 7 
years to complete. Once the baby is separated from its protective mother, the 
animal is introduced to a young mahout who will be its partner, boss and friend 
for the rest of its -- and probably the mahout's -- working life. Elephants are 
retired at 60. 
</P>
<P>
The highly intelligent animals, given pet names by their mahouts, are taught 30 
to 50 commands -- such as kneel, raise your leg, pick up this, put down that, 
lie down, push this, pull this and so forth. A unique and intimate relationship 
develops between the mahout and his elephant during their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
They tell the story of one elephant who used to carry his mahout home in his 
trunk when his master got drunk. The mahout does carry an anka, a small hook, 
but uses it seldomly and reluctantly, preferring verbal orders and intricate 
signals with his knees applied behind the elephant's ears. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, a mahout is injured or killed by an elephant, usually by a male. 
The attacks generally occur during the animals' annual musth period, when a 
glandular secretion causes some to become merely irritable and others to go 
crazy and attack anyone who approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Considering how many elephants there are in the country, one or two fatalities 
a year is considered a small number. The most dangerous elephant on record was 
one that is said to have killed 14 mahouts during its musth period in Burma in 
the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Elephants work hard when they work, but it is clearly understood between them 
what hours they will keep. After an early morning bath, they start work at 6 
and stop at 11. Most elephants refuse to work after noon, except for 
demonstrations, and they work only four days a week. Despite their strength and 
size, they are vulnerable to sun stroke, snake bites and various other 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, like so many other wondrous things in this modern world, the 
elephant is seemingly being phased out. Teak once was Thailand's major export 
and, before World War II, 80% of the country was covered by forest. Now the 
figure is less than 20% and dwindling fast. As the woods disappear, so do the 
herds of wild elephants that furnish new domestic ones. 
</P>
<P>
A 1977 informed estimate put the number of wild elephants in Thailand at 
between 2,000 and 4,450. In the absence of any more recent statistics, one must 
assume that the lower figure is now the more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
For the domestic elephant, a 1982 Ministry of Interior count was 4,739; a 
current estimate would be a little more than 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers are a far cry from the 13,397 domestic animals counted in 1952, 
and the 100,000 in regular employ at the turn of the century, when a thousand 
elephants provided transport on one trade route alone in northern Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
The grim outlook is compounded by the fact that the birth rate among domestic 
elephants is declining at about 9% a year. 
</P>
<P>
A sad picture, especially when one considers that some 20% of the Indian 
elephants in the world reside in Thailand. Hunting and poaching is illegal, 
though it goes on as in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The decline is all the more tragic since the elephant has been so prominent in 
Thailand's history, art and culture since the beginning of the kingdom in the 
13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been man's working partner," says writer John Hoskin, an elephant 
expert. "It has carried kings into battle, it has played an integral role in 
ceremonies, it has been a symbol of strength and good fortune and a common 
motif in Thai art." 
</P>
<P>
But for a limited while, the visitor can still enjoy, ride on and photograph 
what the Thais lovingly call "the jungle tractor."

<P>
Getting there: A number of airlines fly from Los Angeles to Bangkok, including 
United, Delta, Northwest, Singapore and Thai. Economy fares cost about $1,500 
round trip, depending on the time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways offers service from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, about 430 miles north, 
for $106 round trip. Contact Thai Airways at (800) 426-5204. 
</P>
<P>
When to go: The best months to visit Thailand are November through February. A 
good time to go for elephant lovers is mid-November, for the annual Elephant 
Roundup in Surin, which is about 300 miles northeast of Bangkok. The colorful 
event, which draws visitors from around the world, is a sort of celebration 
involving about 150 elephants, with music, games, contests, etc., held in an 
area the size of a football field. This year, the event will take place Nov. 
17-18. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations: Among the best places to stay in Chiang Mai are the Chiang Inn, 
100 Changklan Road (175 rooms, air-conditioned; from $50 single per night to 
$200 for suites), and the Orchid Chiang Mai, 100 Huay Kaew Road 
(air-conditioned, swimming pool; from $50 to $300). 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the elephants: There are several elephant training areas near Chiang 
Mai. The best is probably at Lampang, less than an hour's drive from the city. 
Some have pleasant restaurants. The concierge at your hotel can give you the 
prices of the day's outing, which will vary but usually cost less than $100 per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Visas: No visa is needed for Thailand unless travelers are planning to stay 
more than 14 days. 
</P>
<P>

Blvd., Suite 1101, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 382-2353. Baraby Conrad

WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: TERRORIST ATTACKS POSSIBLE IN MIDEAST, EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY

<TEXT>
<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
<P>
Iraq/Kuwait: Due to the continuing crisis, avoid travel to Qatar, Bahrain, the 
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Yemen and Oman. Keep a close 
eye on developments if you are considering travel to Israel. At this time, 
however, travel to Israel, Turkey and Egypt remains safe for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism warning: The U.S. Department of State has issued a warning about 
possible terrorist attacks in Europe and the Middle East, as a result of the 
Iraq/Kuwait crisis. The warning states, "Evidence continues to accumulate that 
Iraqi-sponsored terrorism may occur in the near future." The evidence 
reportedly indicates that Europe and the Middle East are the likeliest places 
for these attacks, and the warning goes on to say, "While information does not 
suggest that Americans traveling abroad are the specific targets of possible 
Iraqi-sponsored terrorism, Americans overseas should exercise caution, 
particularly when in or near U.S. military or civilian facilities or at other 
facilities commonly identified as 'American.' " 
</P>
<P>
ASIA 
</P>
<P>
India: An attempt to reserve more jobs in the central government for 
lower-caste Indians has provoked violent protests in Delhi and other cities 
across northern India. Avoid large gatherings and exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal: One result of the new-found democracy here has been the developing 
awareness among Sherpas and porters who man climbing expeditions and work for 
trekking agencies of the value of unity to obtain higher wages. Loose labor 
unions are forming and the cost of mounting expeditions to the Himalayas is 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan: Whatever the outcome of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's legal 
wranglings to have her dismissal rescinded, national elections are scheduled 
Oct. 24, and could be volatile. Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
AFRICA 
</P>
<P>
Liberia: Civil war continues; defer travel here until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
Nigeria: A new law prohibits smoking in public places, including cinemas, 
elevators, schools, offices and on public transportation, punishable by up to 
two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union: Alaska Airlines plans to begin regular summer service to the 
Soviet Far East next June, the result of agreements reached between the United 
States and Soviet Union. Flights will be offered three times a week from 
mid-June through August, from Anchorage to Magadan and on to Khabarovsk, and 
will be timed to connect with flights from Seattle. The route will be the first 
and only entree to the Soviet Far East from the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria: There are signs that more unrest is brewing in this country where 
promises of reform by the Communist Party resulted in its return to power in 
free elections following the political upheaval of the past year. Recent 
demonstrations against the government and the growing strength of the 
opposition indicate that a struggle for power may resume. Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
France: For the first time, water is being rationed to pilgrims at the famous 
shrine of Lourdes. Previously, pilgrims were permitted to take home as much as 
they wanted, but now they are restricted to one small container to protect the 
levels of the bathing pools, at least until the end of the peak season this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA 
</P>
<P>
and CARIBBEAN 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador: Civil war drags on here, and travel to the northern and eastern 
parts of the country is dangerous and should be avoided. If arriving by air, 
allow enough time to clear customs and depart the airport by 5:30 p.m. If 
arriving by road, the safest routes are along the Guatemalan border in the 
south. Avoid traveling after dark, stay away from military vehicles and army 
patrols, and stay indoors after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala: National elections are scheduled for Nov. 11, and with them will 
come heightened tensions and possible violence. Political violence has 
increased in recent months, and President Vinicio Cerezo has ordered an 
investigation of army involvement in the June 8 murder of a popular American 
resident, which pits Cerezo against an institution believed to be more powerful 
than the government. A sharp increase in poppy production has also moved the 
United States to place Guatemala on a short list of countries contributing to 
international drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua: The threat of general strikes and other unrest to protest government 
austerity measures exists. The deposed Sandinistas are flexing their muscles as 
an opposition party, threatening a mass anti-government movement. Although the 
government has moved to ease the austerity plan's effects, tensions remain 
high. Such unrest could affect travel. 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad &amp; Tobago: A passport and proof of return or onward tickets is now 
required of arriving or departing travelers. The new regulation is a result of 
the July/August coup attempt against the government. An 11 p.m.-to-5 a.m. 
curfew remains in effect throughout Trinidad, but there is no curfew in Tobago. 
Conditions are returning to normal, with most air service restored, but it's 
not clear yet whether flights around the Christmas holidays -- which are 
usually heavily overbooked in both directions -- will be as busy this year. 
Business in pubs and nightclubs is picking up now that the curfew has been 
moved from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHEAST ASIA 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia: Monkeys in Sangeh, Bali, are becoming accomplices to crime. There 
have been cases of monkeys filching eyeglasses, guidebooks or anything not 
firmly gripped or tied down from travelers, then dropping them when chased by 
local people. The not-so-friendly locals then have refused to return the goods 
without payment. Watch your possessions, even around seemingly innocent 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Philippines: Threats of violence by Communist rebels (NPA) accompanied recent 
talks between Philippine and U.S. officials on the future of American bases 
there, and prompted the State Department to issue a warning to avoid Roxas 
Boulevard near the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Talks have adjourned until late this month, but the advisory should be heeded 
in light of a recent rejection by the NPA of the government's proposal to cease 
hostilities in metropolitan Manila. Adding to the confusion, mutinous soldiers 
trying to destabilize the government recently set off bombs in the offices of 
three American companies. 
</P>

TRAVELING TO THE HEART OF THE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Feldman and Iris Schneider 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there: Aeromexico and Mexicana Airlines offer daily service between Los 
Angeles and Oaxaca, with a change of planes in Mexico City. Round-trip fares 
are about $420. Flight time between Mexico City and Oaxaca is one hour. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: Oaxaca's classiest -- and most expensive -- hotel is the 
Presidente (Calle Cinco de Mayo 300, call 011-52-951-60611), a 400-year-old 
former convent run by the Stouffer chain. The Presidente has a swimming pool 
and is a five-minute walk from the zocalo (central square). A double room is 
$110 per night. Reservations: (800) 468-3571. 
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of town is the Mision de los Angeles (Calzada Porfirio Diaz 
102, call 011-951-515-00). The hotel's pleasant grounds include tennis courts 
and a swimming pool. While well removed from the zocalo, it can prove a 
pleasant respite from the downtown bustle, particularly at festival time. Cost: 
$55 per night for a double room. Reservations: (800) 221-6509. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the edge of the city are the Fortin Plaza, at $46 per night 
(reservations: 800-826-6842), and the Hotel Victoria, $50 per night 
(800-223-9868). 
</P>
<P>
On the zocalo itself, hotels include the Marques del Valle (pretty lobby and 
inside balcony, but single beds in most rooms) and the Monte Alban. Both are 
more authentically Mexican than the others, but the rooms can be a bit noisy 
due to the central location. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around: Oaxaca, a compact city with narrow streets and limited parking 
spaces, is a good place for strolling. Hotels at the outskirts of town are a 
20-minute walk to the zocalo. Cabs are the other option, with fares from $3 to 
$6 for most destinations within city limits. Taxis are also a wise choice for 
day-trips to surrounding towns. Negotiate prices -- from $10 to $30 -- before 
departing. 
</P>
<P>
For a taste of local culture, take public buses to nearby towns. They leave 
from the Benito Juarez bus station on the outskirts of Oaxaca. Schedules are 
erratic, and most buses are standing room only. However, the locals, who carry 
aboard everything from live turkeys to huge containers of mole sauce, are 
extremely cordial. 
</P>
<P>
Bus tours of nearby sights, including the ruins at Monte Alban and Mitla, are 
also available. Tours for Monte Alban leave daily from the Hotel Meson del 
Angel (Calle Mina), but check for updated schedules at major hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile rentals are available through Hertz. The weekly rate for an 
economy-size, manual-transmission car is $240. Be sure to reserve ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Where to eat: Restaurants and outdoor cafes line the zocalo, and vendors weave 
their way among the tables, selling local crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Overlooking the zocalo from a second-floor balcony is one of the city's few 
upscale restaurants, the Asador Vasco. Specialties include chicken mole and 
casseroles. Prices for dinner: $8 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
Across the square is the Meson del Taco, a simple but good restaurant 
frequented by locals and tourists. Prices: $4 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
Off the main square, El Biche Pobre II (on Calzada de Republica) and the 
restaurant/coffee house El Sol y La Luna (on Murgia), feature live music as 
well as dining. Paul Feldman and Iris Schneider

NATURE SHOWS THE WAY ON FRIENDLY MOLOKAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molokai, known for a century for its infamous leper colony, has always been a 
bit off the tourist track. But "The Friendly Isle" has a lot to offer -- 
particularly for the hiker and nature lover. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to get away from it all, Molokai is definitely away from it all. 
The island has a couple of beaches, a lush rain forest, some very modest 
resorts and a natural Hawaiian beauty second to none. What the island doesn't 
have is night life or even one single stoplight. 
</P>
<P>
On the tiny island is Hawaii's largest expanse of old-growth tropical forest. 
With a little time and effort, the intrepid hiker can discover what Kamakou 
Preserve Manager Ed Misaki calls "the real Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Three of my favorite Molokai hikes include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kalaupapa National Historic Park, which was set aside in 1980 to preserve 
the former place of exile for victims of Hansen's disease (leprosy). For a 
century, those suffering from mai hookaawale (separating sickness) were 
isolated from the rest of the world by the steep lava walls of the Kalaupapa 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1960s, the development of sulfone drugs had brought Hansen's disease 
under control, but many sufferers, isolated for so long from the outside world, 
elected to stay. The historic settlement, formerly a place of almost 
unbelievable misery, is now open to guided tours; the tour leaders are the 
residents themselves, with help from the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
On the tour, visitors view the homes, hospital facilities and stores of the 
settlement, as well as the church built by the courageous Father Damien, who 
arrived in 1873 to work with the afflicted exiles in what was often referred to 
as a "living tomb." After much good work, Father Damien himself eventually 
contracted leprosy and died. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, although long a place of the damned, the Kalaupapa Peninsula is one 
of the most beautiful places in all of Hawaii. Don't miss the short walk 
through Palaau State Park, which provides a panoramic overlook of the 
peninsula. Another trail leads through tall pine trees to much-photographed 
Phallic Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The Molokai Mule Ride (about $80) is the way most people visit the Kalaupapa 
settlement. However, you can hike down for about $30. Even if you hike, you 
must sign up for a tour. It's a six-mile round-trip trek, with 26 switchbacks 
and a 1,600-foot elevation drop. (Save some energy for the steep uphill return 
trip.) 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the trail, hikers join the mule riders for a guided walking 
and bus tour of Kalaupapa National Historic Park. The tour includes a box 
lunch. For more information, contact Molokai Mule Ride, P.O. Box 200, Kualapuu, 
Molokai, Hawaii 96757, (800) 843-5978. On the island: 567-6088. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halawa Valley. Located on the extreme east end of the island, this is a 
good introduction to the joys of tripping afoot on Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
In the valley are some of Hawaii's oldest village sites, dating to AD 650. For 
many centuries farmers cultivated taro on hillside terraces here. Halawa Valley 
is about 20 miles from the isle's main town of Kaunakakai. The drive along 
Kamehameha V Highway (450) to the valley passes ancient fish ponds, churches, 
black-sand beaches and historic markers. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the highway is the trail head for the path through Halawa Valley. 
The trail leads two sometimes-muddy miles past taro patches and guava, and 
through a green jungle to Moaula Falls. The falls fills a rock-rimmed basin, 
which is one of the more scenic swimming pools you'll ever see, though kind of 
chilly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kawiakou Preserve. Under the watchful eye of the Nature Conservancy, this 
area protects a wondrous rain forest. More than 200 plants grow here and 
nowhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
You reach the preserve by driving up a muddy road (sometimes impassable) 
through slopes forested with cedar, eucalyptus and Monterey cypress. Waikolu 
(Three Waters) Overlook offers grand views of waterfalls and steep cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the trail through the preserve is on a narrow wooden 
boardwalk that leads through Pepeopae Bog, believed to be 10,000 years old. 
Violets and orchids brighten the primordial ooze. Some plants are but dwarfs of 
their species, while others, such as giant tree ferns, grow to astonishing 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to visit the preserve on your own, but an even better way to go 
is to join one of the occasional guided walking tours given by the Nature 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Contact the Molokai Preserves Manager, Box 40, Kualapuu, Molokai 96757, (808) 
567-6680.

LIVING LEGEND STARS IN BAYOU CRUISE

HOUMA, La.

<TEXT>
<P>
He was born in a cabin beneath bald cypress trees. 
</P>
<P>
He once caught a 45-pound catfish. 
</P>
<P>
He calls his dog "Gator Bait." 
</P>
<P>
Meet Ronald (Black) Guidry, host of "A Cajun Man's Swamp Cruise" in Houma, La. 
The three-hour boat trip, billed as "The Authentic Cajun Musical Cruise," 
offers close-up views of alligators, insight into the swamp ecosystem and a 
look at life in the heart of Louisiana's Bayou country. 
</P>
<P>
But the chief attraction is Guidry, a talented entertainer who delights 
tourists with his good nature, bad jokes and genuine Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell you everything I know about the swamp, which isn't a lot," 
says Guidry by way of introduction. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If I don't know the answer, I'll 
lie and you won't know the difference and everybody will be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disclaimer, this Cajun knows the swamp inside and out. He's happy 
to educate visitors about the area that's been his lifelong home. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry's ancestors left St. Malo, France, in 1675 for Nova Scotia, then came to 
Louisiana in 1765. "Bayou is an Indian word meaning natural stream or 
waterway," Guidry explains. 
</P>
<P>
"Canals are man-made. The swamp is covered with water, but has a solid bottom 
14 to 16 feet below the water that supports trees." 
</P>
<P>
Guidry points out that the graceful Spanish moss suspended from the trees is 
not a parasite but a bromeliad, used at one time for cushioning material. 
</P>
<P>
"I slept on a mattress filled with Spanish moss when I was young," he says. 
"People used to collect it and sell it for a penny a pound." 
</P>
<P>
Guidry is no relation to the former New York Yankee pitcher and 1978 Cy Young 
Award winner of the same name, who, oddly enough, is from Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the name first; he's younger than me," Guidry says. 
</P>
<P>
As the 49-passenger canopied boat glides past water hyacinths and duckweed, 
visitors view abundant wildlife: turtles, snakes, rabbits, swallows, nutria and 
water rats with webbed feet. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry directs visitors' attention to a great blue heron, one of the many 
magnificent birds that inhabit the swamp. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make a good gumbo out of that if you smother it with onions," he 
deadpans. "The blue heron has a very distinct flavor. It's between the whooping 
crane and the bald eagle." 
</P>
<P>
The real show begins when Guidry spots some alligators nearby. In his 
distinctive Cajun/Southern twang, he calls to them as if they're old buddies. 
"C'mon, Ginger! Mama Jane, you hungry?" 
</P>
<P>
They react to the sound of his voice like children to an ice cream truck. 
Guidry feeds them raw chicken legs, which they seize in their powerful jaws as 
tour-takers crowd the side of the boat to get a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
When one small alligator had frostbite last winter, Guidry "nursed him back to 
health like a little child." 
</P>
<P>
Now the reptile "has come to be a good friend of mine." So good that on a 
recent trip, Guidry decided he would thrill the tourists by bringing his 
"friend" on board. 
</P>
<P>
He grabbed the gator with a noose-like rope and pulled it onto the boat. Much 
to everyone's surprise, the animal promptly got loose. Gator Bait and the 
alligator "went round and round in the corner," Guidry remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"Gator Bait didn't do much but bark at him, and the gator sat there with his 
mouth wide open. I got a big round of applause out of it. Finally I got the 
noose on and put him back in the water," he says, relieved that nothing 
disastrous occurred. "I ain't goin' to try that again!" 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the way through the tour, the boat arrives at a secluded 
spot for the day's highlight -- the Cajun concert advertised in Guidry's 
colorful brochure. 
</P>
<P>
First, he pulls out his homemade accordion, its parts more suited to a hardware 
store than a musical instrument: 44-caliber bullet caps, an aluminum welding 
rod, household molding, a bicycle spoke, cabinet knobs and chair gliders. 
</P>
<P>
"This part acts as a microphone," says Guidry, holding up the mouthpiece from 
an older-style telephone. "If you go to use a pay phone and this is missing, 
somebody borrowed it to make an accordion." The only store-bought parts are the 
bellows and the reeds. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief instrumental, Guidry doffs the accordion and switches to guitar 
for a rendition of "Jolie Blonde." He loosely translates the French lyrics as, 
"Pretty blonde, why did you run away and leave me for that guy from California, 
you rascal, you? Ain't you never comin' back again, or what?" 
</P>
<P>
The lush, humid swamp provides the perfect backdrop for about a half-hour of 
entertainment, then the boat cruises back to the docks at the Bayou Black 
Marina. Tourists left wanting more can purchase one of the "few hundred 
thousand tapes" Guidry wryly says he has for sale. 
</P>
<P>
A former Green Beret and Louisiana state trooper, Guidry got into the swamp 
tour business only a few years ago. His sideline of entertaining had made him a 
minor celebrity on local television, where he was noticed by some influential 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"A bank president called me and said, 'You're a character. We'd like to put you 
in the swamp tour business,"' Guidry recalls. 
</P>
<P>
He summarily dismissed the idea at first, then took his wife Sondra's advice 
and thought it over. When the investors agreed to his conditions -- including 
that Guidry be the only one to give the tours, in order to provide visitors 
with an authentic Cajun experience -- he decided the time was right to make 
entertaining his full-time profession. 
</P>
<P>
And he has had no trouble fulfilling tourists' expectations. Guidry has a 
simple philosophy that is evidenced in the care he takes to make sure everyone 
on board has a good time. "I enjoy people," he says. "I really do."

TRAVEL VIDEOS: 'GLORY' SHOWS RARELY FILMED HADRIAN'S WALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Glory of England" (Traveloguer Collection, 60 minutes, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Frank Nichols' video explores only England, with an itinerary extended to such 
less-filmed sites as Hadrian's Wall to the north and Land's End south at 
Cornwall. 
</P>
<P>
Other scenes include reenactments of local historical events and scenes of 
medieval festivities that, although bearing the "made-for-the-tourist" label, 
are colorful and entertaining for armchair travelers. 
</P>
<P>
After touring Dover and Canterbury, Nichols goes to Cambridge for a jousting 
tournament at Belvoir Castle. In Sherwood Forest, actors reenact scenes from 
the legend of Robin Hood and in the Peaks District a performance of English 
country dancers is held. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring the North Yorkshire region, the video focuses on the city of York, 
its archeological sites, old Shambles area and the beautiful stained-glass 
windows of York Minster, plus a side trip to a country fair and fox hunt at 
Castle Howard, the setting for TV's "Brideshead Revisited." 
</P>
<P>
A visit with author/veterinarian James Herriot takes place at his "surgery" 
(doctor's office) in the Yorkshire Dales. The St. Wilfred's Day parade at Ripon 
presents some colorful scenes. Then the camera journeys to Bamburgh Castle and 
the Roman-built Hadrian's Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Shown is the lovely Lake District and Chester, where the town crier still 
appears every afternoon, and Abbotts Bromley, where the unusual Horn Dance 
takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of London, visited are Warwick Castle, Shakespeare's Stratford-on-Avon, 
Oxford University, Blenheim Palace, Bourton-on-the-Water and the charming 
village of Castle Combe in the Cotswolds. 
</P>
<P>
Back in London, viewers can take a Thames River cruise, peek at the crown 
jewels, attend an Elizabethan banquet at Hatfield House and visit Windsor 
Castle and town. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to visiting Stonehenge and Bath, viewers can march along the trail 
of King Arthur to Winchester, where his round table hangs, and to Glastonbury 
Abbey, associated with legends of Arthur and the Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from Traveloguer Collection, 3301 Hampden Ave., Suite N., 
Englewood, Colo. 80110, (800) 521-5104. Price: $29.95, including a small 
reference booklet with a map, history and travel tips. 
</P>
<P>
"Australia" (Laura McKenzie, Republic Pictures Home Video, 60 minutes, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie combines a lively, knowledgeable narration with a well-photographed 
video that offers an entertaining supplement to the standard guide book. 
Although she doesn't visit Perth or Adelaide, McKenzie provides some alternate 
sights and offers personal observations and candid advice. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporated into the segments are lists for sightseeing and shopping, hotels 
and restaurants from modest to deluxe, local transportation tips, night life 
choices, side trips and suggested city itineraries. It even has a course in 
"Aussie English." 
</P>
<P>
The Sydney tour takes in most of the traditional sights such as the opera house 
and bridge, museums, Chinatown, the shops of Double Bay, Queen Victoria mall, 
Paddy's Flea market and Bondi and Manly beaches, where a blimp ride offers 
sightseeing. 
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, the film covers the cathedral, National Art Gallery, Victoria 
Arts Center, the zoo, Chinatown and such shops as those on Upper Collins 
Street, the Bourke Street arcades and Queen Victoria Market. 
</P>
<P>
Side trips are to Ballarat for its theme park, Sovereign Hill, a restored gold 
town, and afterward to Phillip Island to see the fairy penguins. 
</P>
<P>
In Queensland, the video tours Brisbane, roving through King George Square, St. 
John's Cathedral, an 1820 windmill, the botanical gardens, Queen's Street Mall, 
Wintergarden shopping center and Chinatown. There also are stops at the 
Queensland Arts Center and Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
General information on planning a trip -- customs laws, precautions, 
electricity, health and medicine, currency and airport departure taxes -- 
concludes the film. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from Republic Pictures Home Video, P.O. Box 66930, Los 
Angeles 90066-0930, (213) 306-4040. Price: $19.98.

mountains. It also offers tour packages with hotels. For more information, call 
(800) 872-7245. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is the new Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans similar to the various 
marine parks such as Sea World? 
</P>
<P>
A: The new $50-million aquarium along the Mississippi will exhibit 10,000 fish, 
plus wildlife from North, Central and South American habitats. There'll be 
entertainment, but no killer whale or dolphin circus. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there any bed and breakfast inns in New York City? If so, what do they 
cost? 
</P>
<P>
A: Call the Bed and Breakfast Network at (212) 645-8134. Generally, singles 
range from $50 and doubles from $70, as well as unhosted apartments from $80.

</P>
<P>
Q: Do most large hotels have business centers for personal use? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most large chains either offer such facilities or locate them for guests. 
Some also can supply such extras as secretarial service, computer printers, a

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking to stretch your budget? A variety of foreign tourist offices produce 
publications specifically for young visitors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the city of Munich, Germany, publishes an excellent 20-page, 
English-language booklet, "Young People's Guide to Munich." 
</P>
<P>
Copies are available for a small fee (about 30 cents) from the city's tourist 
office, which is inside Munich's main train station at the Bayerstrasse exit. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet is packed with practical, helpful information. 
</P>
<P>
It starts with a map of the central rail station and gives details on where to 
find luggage storage, currency exchange, mail pickup points and long-distance 
telephone services, which are open 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
It also covers details on budget accommodations, from youth hostels and 
pensions to a 400-person tent operated by the city and open from June through 
August. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find information on medical services, do-it-yourself walking tours, 
economical eating and entertainment, public transportation, bank and store 
hours, and where to find Laundromats, bicycle rentals and agencies that match 
drivers and riders (hitchhiking by appointment). 
</P>
<P>
Britain also publishes a special 31-page guide for young travelers. It's free 
and available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Young Visitors to Britain" is designed to help with plans for study, work and 
group or independent travel. 
</P>
<P>
It covers information and contacts for exchange programs, volunteer and au pair 
positions, pen friends, transportation, emergency assistance and accommodations 
ranging from camping and hostels to bed and breakfasts and university 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet offers details on how to contact groups such as the 54-member 
British Universities Accommodations Consortium, or the 61-member Higher 
Education Accommodation Consortium, each of which have thousands of beds 
available to travelers during holiday periods. 
</P>
<P>
One section of the guide offers specific addresses and rates for budget 
accommodations throughout Britain, from hotels and residences to a "Tent City," 
on the outskirts of London, which offers young travelers beds for about $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of "Young Visitors to Britain" are available from the British Tourist 
Authority, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 90071, (213) 628-3525.

BEGGARS AND PEDDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was interested in your News and Briefs article Aug. 12 about the improved 
conditions of the beggars and peddlers in Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
I just returned from there and was saddened by the number of beggars and 
peddlers on the streets. You could not walk five steps without being accosted 
by someone. You cannot help them all. There are too many. 
</P>
<P>
I saw a woman nursing a baby as she sold gum. I saw women dragging children who 
were so tired I could have cried for them. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that the authorities should clean up the area, not just talk 
about it. It is a shame.

<P>
Regarding "These Austrian Hills Look Too Good to be True," Sept. 16: The author 
touches briefly on the "bustling little city of Gmunden" but he doesn't mention 
that to reach Gmunden, one must travel through Ebensee, located in one of the 
loveliest regions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Ebensee was one of 60 sites of the Mauthausen concentration camp complex. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946-47, my unit did time there and also south of Salzburg searching for 
suspected Nazi criminals and escaped POWs. Please be forewarned that many 
locals show resentment to photographers at death camp sites.

OPERA DIRECTOR ROBERT WILSON'S PERSONA BELIES THE PASSION HE AROUSES FROM 
CRITICS AND AUDIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is Robert Wilson, and what does he want? 
</P>
<P>
Both questions are complex. The first question is easier to answer than the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was born 48 years ago amid the Southern-Baptist Victorianism of Waco, 
Tex. His instincts must be archetypally American. They have been filtered, 
however, through a chic European sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
He is a futurist and a visionary. He is an artist, a director, a designer, a 
producer, a therapist, a showman and a missionary. He stages operas, plays, 
musicals, happenings. He writes. He even creates his own furniture. 
</P>
<P>
He is an aesthetic zealot and a gutsy iconoclast. He is an auteur and a 
provocateur. 
</P>
<P>
He stretches stylization until it becomes abstraction, often inspired 
abstraction. He paints a stage with color, accents with shadow. He redefines 
traditional concepts of both space and time. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's time moves at a measured, languid pace. It is determinedly unnatural 
pace. For those willing to suspend temporal disbelief, the slowness can quickly 
become hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
He respects no conventional limits involving endurance, no common parameters in 
matters of perception. He has survived long enough to withstand several 
changings of the avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
He works in studios and theaters, arenas and opera houses. He respects no 
language barriers. He demands enormous expenditures of time and money. 
</P>
<P>
He subjects his actors to strict kinetic signals and taxing physical poses. He 
makes his own aesthetic rules and, when the spirit moves him, blithely breaks 
them. 
</P>
<P>
He flinches neither from controversy nor from obscurity. He once regaled 
attendants at a press conference in Yugoslavia with a repetitive 12-hour 
recitation of the word "dinosaur," during which he carefully sliced onion after 
onion after onion. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers found the demonstration fraught with poetic meaning and pristine 
truth. Others dismissed it as arrogant gimmickry. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's supporters acclaim him as a genius, impure and not necessarily simple. 
They hail his unfettered spirit, his delicate control of visual imagery, his 
daring manipulation of prop and symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Moved by the so-called silence play "Deafman Glance" -- running merely seven 
hours, it is a relatively short effort by Wilson standards -- the poet Louis 
Aragon once published a characteristically surreal tribute: 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw anything more beautiful in the world since I was born. Never, 
never has any play come anywhere near this one." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson shrugs off idolatry, or at least pretends to. "I'm not a guru," he has 
declared. "I'm an artist. I hate this mystique around my name." 
</P>
<P>
The mystique has not gone unchallenged. Wilson's stubborn detractors find his 
work unbearably boring, unbelievably demanding, disastrously stilted, 
hopelessly smug. 
</P>
<P>
One distinguished New York theater critic once dismissed a Wilson opus as "an 
artistic and human scandal." The non-believer insisted that such work could 
appeal only to "escapees from thought, feeling and confrontations with 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
Even Wilson's most ardent detractors admit, albeit grudgingly, that he is no 
dilettante. Although he may be demanding, alienating, perplexing and 
disturbing, he also is thoughtful, serious, sensitive. There is method in his 
method. 
</P>
<P>
He likes to shock, it would seem. It would also seem that he doesn't like to 
shock for the sake of shocking. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks big and he thinks long. He asks much of his audiences. He doesn't 
suffer fools, period. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have to suffer fools. He has amassed a huge coterie of passionate, 
dedicated admirers in Europe. Meanwhile, in America, he has remained a cult 
figure for the enlightened few -- a prophet with limited honor. Now that may be 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
What does Wilson want? 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? Maybe even Wilson doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
He enjoys the reputation of an artistic Superman. He comes to an interview 
looking like Clark Kent. 
</P>
<P>
The locale is the temporarily vacated office of the general director of the 
Lyric Opera of Chicago. The time is 5:50. In 1 1/2 hours, the curtain will rise 
on the gala opening of the season and, not incidentally, on the American 
premiere of Wilson's controversial production of Gluck's "Alceste." 
</P>
<P>
This is the time when directors are supposed to pace nervously backstage, to 
recheck mechanics, to institute 11th-hour changes, to bestow last-minute 
confidences upon cast and technicians. This is the time when directors chomp 
antacids, chain-smoke, enact desperation tantrums, offer sacrifices to the 
pagan gods of theater and massage prima-donna egos. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the time to meet the press. Wilson doesn't seem to know that. He had 
chosen this time, and it doesn't seem to faze him. 
</P>
<P>
He arrives promptly, led by opera-company guides and trailed by a supportive 
young aide de camp. He brings no onions, performs no one-note monologues. 
</P>
<P>
His gangly 6-foot-4 frame is impeccably tuxedoed. No trendy rags for this 
futurist. He wears his hair straight and relatively short, sports dark 
horn-rimmed specs. He could pass muster as a pre-Ivy-League headmaster. 
</P>
<P>
He responds to questions but volunteers little. He is courteous, ever-amiable 
yet potentially laconic. His drawl is diluted with cosmopolitan nuance. At the 
outset he functions like a proud graduate of the hoary my-art-speaks-for-itself 
school. Then he thaws. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, "Alceste" is on his mind. Although he had staged a similar 
production a few years earlier in Stuttgart, this one represents a culmination 
of a longstanding plan. Jessye Norman, one of his favored and favorite 
collaborators, is now assuming the title role. 
</P>
<P>
"I designed the whole piece for her," he explains. "The way I work, a piece is 
adjusted to the personality of the performer. It was Jessye who asked to do 
this in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson says he has done much to accommodate the statuesque prima donna. "I have 
given her lots of space. The doors are very tall. She is a big woman. The 
production is really in scale for her." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the opera, Wilson first staged Euripides' "Alcestis" in Boston. 
"Some things about the ancient text," he admits, "helped me to understand." 
</P>
<P>
Both director and diva had a major disagreement with the Chicago management 
about one element in the opera production: supertitles. The management wanted 
the translated text projected, as is now usual, on a screen atop the 
proscenium. The creative protagonists did not. "For this production, the titles 
seemed too disturbing," Wilson says, almost diplomatically. "I objected to 
them. I'm a visual artist, and I'm very concentrated on looking at the stage." 
He stresses the verb. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece is very carefully detailed. Gestures are carefully rehearsed, 
choreographed. Movements are slower than what we normally see in a stage 
setting. To make the audience look up and look down would be too disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
When pressed, he confirms a theoretical distaste for operatic captions. "I have 
never worked with them. In this production they could be especially confusing." 
</P>
<P>
In passing, he warns that one desired effect will be missing from the opening 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"There is supposed to be fire at the altar, but Miss Norman had a reaction to 
the chemicals, so we're cutting it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
A wag suggests a solution: Flash the cue-word "FIRE" on the unused screen at 
the appropriate moment. Wilson finds the mock-idea hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you work for the Chicago Lyric Opera," he admonishes. "It took me a 
long time to get rid of those supertitles. Now I hope everyone is happy." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson worries little about impulses getting lost in non-translation. After 
all, he recently went to Munich to stage a difficult Chekhov play, "Swan Song," 
in German. He claims, when asked, that he doesn't happen to speak German. The 
thought makes him laugh. 
</P>
<P>
How did he convey his ideas to the actors? 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to come and watch me do it," he quips. 
</P>
<P>
Then he executes a disarming shrug. 
</P>
<P>
If all had gone as planned and hoped a few years ago, Los Angeles would know a 
good deal about Robert Wilson. In 1984, the Olympic Arts Festival was supposed 
to host the premiere of his most magnum of magnum-opuses, "the CIVIL warS" 
(that's his own quirky capitalization). 
</P>
<P>
The sociopolitical historical ultra-extravaganza, subtitled "a tree is best 
measured when it is down," was to last 12 hours, cost $7 million and enlist 
massive, stellar forces from at least four countries. It was to play in the 
vast open spaces of Shrine Auditorium, capacity 6,600. This could have been an 
opera -- if one may call it that -- to end all operas, a music drama to 
out-Wagner Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, "the CIVIL warS" were never fought. The logistic challenges 
proved insurmountable. The money ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was apoplectic at the time. He called Los Angeles "a second-rate 
cultural outpost." He decried "the lack of a cultural policy in this country." 
</P>
<P>
A Paris newspaper echoed the complaint, labeling the cancellation "a crime 
against culture." The Wall Street Journal seconded the accusative motion, 
pointing to a chronic "failure of nerve in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Individual portions of "the CIVIL warS" eventually did find their way to stages 
elsewhere. The sprawling entity, however, remains unperformed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's gone," Wilson now says matter-of-factly. "Parts will probably continue 
to be done, but not the whole thing. It was something built for that moment, 
for that time." 
</P>
<P>
He admits that the imbroglio had "made him crazy." Now his seems philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm over it. I had worked nearly five years. I was in debt. But I learned a 
lot from the experience." 
</P>
<P>
When the cancellation was announced, he blamed the disaster on the Olympic 
Committee, the private fund-raisers and the Los Angeles Times. He said he 
failed to get the support in depth that his project deserved. Now he insists 
that he has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame no one." 
</P>
<P>
His tone doesn't exactly ring with conviction. He pauses, then grins. 
</P>
<P>
"Give me some vodka, and I'll tell you who's to blame." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Wilson is working on two operas together with a tried-and-true 
fellow-minimalist, Philip Glass. The first collaboration is scheduled for a 
1992 premiere in Lisbon. The second should be ready in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson isn't sure where its first performance will take place. "It could be 
America," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
He also admits that he has had a strange love-hate relationship with his own 
country, or, more likely, vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
This, one may recall, is the man who once hurled anti-American expletives at a 
Manhattan audience that, he felt, didn't respond properly to an opus called 
"Edison." If the viewers didn't like it, he suggested, they should "go see 
'Sweeney Todd' or 'The Elephant Man.' " 
</P>
<P>
He never had to do much yelling at his public abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea I was going to have a career in the theater," he explains. "I 
did not plan it." 
</P>
<P>
After attending the University of Texas in Austin from 1959 to 1962, Wilson 
studied painting with George McNeil in Paris. By 1965 he was back in the 
States, earning his B.F.A. from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Next he served 
as apprentice to the futuristic architect Paolo Soleri at the Arcosanti 
Community in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Among other aesthetic experiments, he dabbled in theater in and around New York 
during the late 1960s. His crucial breakthrough, however, took place far from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened in Europe," he says. "I wasn't sure what to do with my life. I 
just caught on, first in France, then Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"An extraordinary thing happened. The minister of culture in France 
commissioned Philip Glass and me to do 'Einstein on the Beach.' He gave us 
$150,000 for the creation. We started a workshop in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be unheard of -- that our government would give two men in France 
money to start a workshop in Paris to create an opera. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, unlike the States, they have a cultural policy. Andre Malraux once 
wrote that he hoped to see a balance of interest in the arts: an interest 
protecting the art of the past, an interest protecting the art of our time, an 
interest protecting the art of our nation and another protecting the art of all 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a historical commitment. That's the difference between Europe and 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that opera in Europe is 30 years ahead of America," Wilson declares. 
"There is a broader range of material presented to the public. They value 
contemporary opera. Even a house like La Scala has a world premiere once a 
year. We are lucky here if we get one every 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot of opera in Wilson's immediate future -- mostly Wagner and 
Mozart. "Parsifal" is planned for Hamburg, "Tristan" for Paris, "Lohengrin" for 
Zurich. The Bastille (he loves the new house backstage, hates it out front) 
will host his "Zauberflote," a production that may rival Peter Sellars' 
controversial Glyndebourne experiment. "Don Giovanni" follows in Berlin, 
"Idomeneo" in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
For years now, one has heard talk of a Bayreuth debut. "It will happen," he 
says, "but not now." 
</P>
<P>
The "Ring"? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so." He adds the physical punctuation of a mock shudder. "It's a 
lot of work. It takes a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
He never shrank from extravagant work and time expenditure in the past. Perhaps 
"the CIVIL warS" have taken their toll after all. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson likes to analyze everything he touches. But he doesn't seem to like 
analytical talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't play an instrument and I can't read music," he has said. "I'm very 
instinctive. My pieces usually end up very precise, but they start out very 
intuitively." 
</P>
<P>
How, one asks, would he expect a novice to approach his "Alceste"? 
</P>
<P>
"I just want people to be open to the experience," he bristles. "I don't choose 
to interpret my works. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, what is important in the theater is that we don't want to make a 
conclusion. We don't want to make a statement, don't want to say what something 
is. We want to ask, 'What is it?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's our responsibility when we make theater -- directors, writers, actors. 
. . . We invite the public in to share something, and ask the question. They 
can make the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson interrupts the interview. It is time for him to take over. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know anything about the design for 'Alceste'?" he asks. "Want me to 
tell you?" 
</P>
<P>
It is a rhetorical question. 
</P>
<P>
He pulls a red felt pen and envelope from his jacket pocket. "I'm going to make 
a little drawing for you quickly, and then I must go." 
</P>
<P>
He executes a neat series of scene sketches, accompanied by a stream of 
conscious descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have done is. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"One sees in the beginning a triangle of light and a cube floating in space. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Gluck speaks of simple nobility. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There is a big doorway with light coming out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The cube is small now, and it is turning as it floats. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We go into a great hallway defined by a series of columns. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He brushes aside an interpolated question about influences on the style. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very simple, a classical composition. My designs parallel the story, but 
they don't directly illustrate it. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do isn't arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
He speaks slowly. He wants each word to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson dispatches the final tableau with swift, sure strokes. It depicts a 
stick figure, Alceste, poised in uncertainty on the threshold of the castle. 
</P>
<P>
He hands over the illustrated envelope and bids a courtly farewell. He has 
choreographed a graceful exit. The interview is over. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't arbitrary.

LINDA RONSTADT HAS PUT THE NEVILLE BROTHERS ON A COURSE TOWARD FAME -- A 
DESTINATION THAT'S ELUDED THEM SINCE THE '70S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Neville and his three brothers have been telling it like it is for 
decades now. And fans have been telling friends, and those friends told more 
friends -- but it took a friend in high places, Linda Ronstadt, to help turn 
the word-of-mouth trickle about the Neville Brothers into a torrent. 
</P>
<P>
Predict that they're gonna be huge, though, and you might be accused of being 
the boy who cried wolf. Together or individually, the brothers have been poised 
on the apparent brink of the big time many times before now -- even before 
Aaron Neville had a Top 10 hit in 1967 with "Tell It Like It Is," an R&amp;B 
ballad of unforgettable poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
Since Art and Aaron hooked up with brothers Cyril and Charles to form their 
family band in the late '70s, they've had a series of breaks -- a management 
contract with industry heavyweight Bill Graham, a slot on the Amnesty 
International revue with U2, an acclaimed album with hip producer Daniel Lanois 
-- none of which turned out to be the big break. 
</P>
<P>
If this really is the Nevilles' time, as many say it is, there are two good 
reasons: the coming together of world beat and Ronstadt. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky that the world is changing in its appreciation of Third World 
music," says Graham. "Even though they're from New Orleans, that music, you mix 
the Cajun and the Latin and the soul. . . . When I say Third World, in the last 
10 years, the feel of our country has changed tremendously because hundreds of 
thousands of Third World people live here now. . . . And the fact that Aaron 
has had such a wonderful success with Linda hasn't hurt either." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
The success Graham speaks of was in the series of balladic duets that prime fan 
Ronstadt recorded with Aaron Neville last year for her million-selling album 
"Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind," including the smash hit "Don't Know 
Much." 
</P>
<P>
Ronstadt has now taken the Neville clan out on tour as her opening act, with 
Aaron joining her for the appropriate duets in her segment of the show. The 
tour hits the Universal Amphitheatre this week for seven nights -- on Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, next Sunday, Oct. 16 and 17 -- and one night at 
the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
So far, audiences on the tour -- many of which, primed for Aaron's soothing, 
angelic voice, might be unprepared for the Nevilles' propulsive sound -- seem 
to like the gumbo as well as the bubble-gum. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Neville, the group's saxophonist and prime spokesman, notes that 
sometimes Ronstadt's older fans in the front rows look a little baffled when 
the brothers do their first up-tempo number. "But once Aaron begins to sing, 
which is with the second number of the set, 'Brother's Keeper,' you can see 
them saying, 'Oh yeah, this is what we came for.' 
</P>
<P>
"Another good thing is looking at some of their faces when they realize which 
one of us it is that has that voice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Neville, 49, is the most physically imposing of the four brothers, 
looking more like an NFL linebacker than a sweet-voiced songbird. It's his 
overwhelming size that makes the video for "Don't Know Much," in which he and 
the nearly dwarfed Ronstadt get very cozy, a little surprising -- although the 
ability of the video's steamy interracial romance to shock middle America 
probably shouldn't be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it started rumors," says Aaron with a laugh, about the video. "Nothing 
like that happened. We were just friends." 
</P>
<P>
On the video shoot, he and Ronstadt needed a little coaching to get less 
"friendly" and more sexy. "The producer called us together and told us if we 
weren't gonna make it look real, there was no sense in doing it. So I guess 
that was the idea, to start rumors, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Neville and Ronstadt first met in 1984 when she was in New Orleans for the 
World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and my brothers were playing at Pete Fountain's club and somebody told me 
she was in the audience, so I dedicated a song to her and called her up on the 
stage to sing some doo-wop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Later she told the press she felt like Cinderella at the ball because she got 
to play with her favorite band and sing with me. I asked her for her autograph 
and she wrote 'To Aaron, love, and I'll sing with you any time, any place.' " 
</P>
<P>
He took her up on that offer about a year later, asking her to come join him at 
an annual benefit for the hungry and homeless held in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"The first song that we both agreed upon and liked was from both of our 
Catholic backgrounds, the Ave Maria," he recalled. "We harmonized on it, and it 
sounded so sweet we started talking about trying to get together to do a 
record. Over the years it evolved and (finally) we got together." 
</P>
<P>
For someone whose strong, clear, high voice is the most recognizable of the 
Nevilles', Aaron is a man of few words in person, his surprisingly low and 
undistinct speaking voice talking only reluctantly of personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about any lingering bitterness over the barren years in the record 
business, he says: "I ain't got time for nothing like that. That was yesterday 
and you can't be holding things in your heart. You gotta make room for good. . 
. . There's a couple times in my life I wasn't too optimistic, but my belief in 
my spirituality, I guess, gave me an incentive to keep on, you know." 
</P>
<P>
The Neville Brothers' latest album, "Brother's Keeper," features several 
gospel-oriented songs, including "Jah Love" (co-written by Cyril and U2's 
Bono). Many of the album's lyrics came out of a book of poems Aaron had been 
compiling since 1980, which seemed to mark a turning point in his own personal 
battles against drugs and other demons. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like God inspired me, so I write a lot about him," says Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
The socially aware, religious and compassionate component of this album and its 
predecessor -- the Daniel Lanois-produced "Yellow Moon," the group's biggest 
commercial breakthrough to date (400,000 sales) -- might seem almost at odds 
with the partying New Orleans spirit once associated with the group. 
</P>
<P>
Says Charles, "There's one or two tunes on each one that are more or less a 
good dancing party tune, but even with those tunes, there's a message in with 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
"We all really feel a heavy spiritual influence in our lives, that through the 
kind of lives we've led and things we went through, we survived and still do 
what it is we really love to do, and we have this collective gift. . . . We 
feel really blessed and that the gift should be used to acknowledge its source, 
rather than just use it to try and make money." 
</P>
<P>
Making money has always been an iffy proposition in the Nevilles' long and 
varied career. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects the brothers have worked on individually or collectively have 
often steered well clear of popular commercialism. Seminal funk and soul groups 
the Soul Machine (formed by Cyril and Aaron) and the Meters (headed by Art) 
never caught on big. 
</P>
<P>
When the brothers finally got together in 1975, it was first as the Wild 
Tchoupitoulas, who dressed in Mardi Gras outfits and played regional music 
heavy on the celebration and voodoo vibes. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, other labors of love take up much of the brothers' time outside the 
group. Art has reformed the Meters as a part-time outfit. Charles has just 
released his first album with an eclectic band appropriately dubbed Charles 
Neville &amp; Diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Cyril's side project is the Uptown All-Stars, who play "New Orleans second-line 
reggae." And Aaron will enter the studio in December to begin work on a solo 
album to be produced by -- surprise -- Linda Ronstadt, about which he says 
little other than that, yes, it will include at least one duet. 
</P>
<P>
The Neville Brothers are diverse enough, it seems, to handle just about 
anything but compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that being true to ourselves musically and being true to our spirits 
is the best thing to do with the music," says Charles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely what makes it special to me, the fact that of all the years of 
our playing live performances -- and we've played New Orleans funk and New 
Orleans rhythm &amp; blues, which is a combination of jazz, doo-wop, gospel, 
blues, Caribbean, African, all of the Deltas -- we see the impact that it has 
at the gigs on the audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"And then when it's happening, we feel what it does to us. We know this is 
something that is worth something. And it should be recognized."

LOCAL MUSEUMS PURSUE ART COLLECTIONS WHILE FIGHTING BOTH EASTERN TRADITION AND 
A REPUTATION FOR INDIFFERENCE 
</P>

Great art collectors and great museums. What a match. Collectors have art, the 
raison d'etre of art museums, but a commodity that few can afford to buy. 
Museums, on the other hand, have palaces to display the art and the means to 
immortalize donors as enlightened cultural patriarchs. The match is such a 
natural that private collections have formed most of America's best museums, 
but with millionaires' egos, scholarly reputations and big bucks at stake, it's 
not surprising that many collector-museum courtships wind up on the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuing collections has been especially tough in Los Angeles, where museums 
were born too late to compete for art that married into old families at the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
York. Southern California boasts the stellar collections of J. Paul Getty, 
Norton Simon and Henry E. Huntington, but local public museums have a 
reputation for being indifferent suitors and losing collections they might have 
had. 
</P>
<P>
Romances with collectors bloomed here in the '80s with the arrival of the 
Museum of Contemporary Art and vigorous expansion at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. But now that the art market encourages collectors to cash in at 
auction and current income tax laws discourage donations, museums all across 
the country must work harder, plead more enticingly and develop new strategies 
to attract privately held treasures. Stung by these financial realities, 
leaders of Los Angeles' public museums say they are spending more energy than 
ever on wooing art. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, the whole business of museums is the cultivation of donors and the 
stimulation of collecting," said Earl A. Powell, director of the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, who spends five to seven nights a week socializing on 
behalf of LACMA. Keeping the museum in the public eye and on collectors' minds 
is essential to building a collection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, lunches with 
prospective donors three or four times a week, and he travels frequently to 
spread the good word about MOCA. The competition for collections has not only 
heated up, it has gone national, Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
"J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery, can appear in your living 
room, like a genie," said one Los Angeles collector whose patronage has been 
solicited from museums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Your alma mater never forgets," said another who has heard fervent appeals 
from university museums. 
</P>
<P>
No hard, fast rules guide museum officials in the pursuit of art, nor is there 
a typical romance. One collector may walk into a director's office and propose 
a quickie marriage, while another is wooed over several decades. Some donors 
demand a high-profile marriage, while others give the museum a peck on the 
cheek and fade away. 
</P>
<P>
But different as their personalities may be, philanthropic collectors share one 
attribute: a commitment to the social good. They may be hungry -- even 
desperate -- for recognition, they may place extreme restrictions on a gift and 
they may flirt with a string of suitors, but if collectors did not have a 
strong sense of social responsibility, museums would not even get a first date, 
museum officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing all major collectors share is a desire to share their art with the 
general public. They want people to see what they have accomplished. These are 
highly motivated, very successful people who want to take a leadership role in 
the evolution of the cultural life of a certain city. They have a high 
self-confidence level. They are concerned about how they will be remembered, 
and that is not a negative thing," Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles art collectors who have made major gifts to museums seem to bear 
out this assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up at a time when being patriotic was as natural as breathing. I think 
supporting public institutions is related to that emotional response. I'm a 
left wing Democrat, not a flag waver, but since the '60s I don't think it has 
come as naturally to feel strongly committed to doing good, corny as that may 
sound," said Max Palevsky, who with his wife, Jodie Evans, recently donated 32 
pieces of Arts and Crafts furniture to the County Museum of Art. Their donation 
is on view at LACMA in "American Arts and Crafts: Virtue in Design," an 
exhibition predominantly from the Palevsky collection. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert Gore Rifkind, who gave a collection of 5,000 German 
Expressionist prints and drawings to the County Museum of Art in 1983 -- in 
conjunction with the museum's purchase of a related library of 4,500 books -- 
traced his social commitment to his late father, Joseph Rifkind. "Dad, who was 
a great philanthropist, used to tell a story about a cow and a pig. The pig 
said, 'Cow, I don't understand why everyone likes you better than me. I give 
people bacon, ham, ribs, sausage, pigs knuckles and pickled pigs feet, but all 
you give is milk.' The cow said, 'Yes, but you're no good to anyone until 
you're dead.' The first big thing is to decide that you are going to be a cow, 
but it's very difficult to determine who's going to get the milk," Rifkind 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the rub for museums. Once potential donors are identified, they 
must be persuaded that one museum -- more than all others -- deserves the milk. 
</P>
<P>
Museums accomplish that feat through a complex and highly variable process that 
includes sweet talk, arm-twisting, scholarly guidance, public recognition and 
-- finally -- hammering out a legally binding agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Tactics must be tailored to collectors' personalities, but the most effective 
appeal seems to concern home and hearth. "I hear of people in California giving 
art to wonderful museums in the East, but I always find that puzzling. My 
allegiance is to where I live," said Palevsky, who became a multimillionaire in 
the late '60s when he sold Scientific Data Systems to Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main reasons for selecting a museum is geographic. We have been 
involved with the County Museum of Art for 30 years, since I was a docent," 
said Jo Ann Ganz, who has collected American art for 26 years with her husband, 
Julian Ganz, a LACMA trustee. The Ganzes, who own McMahan Furniture &amp; 
Appliances, have given art to Yale University Art Gallery and earmarked a few 
pieces for the National Gallery, but the bulk of their collection is willed to 
the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Rifkind has also yielded to the home front. "For me the overriding factor was 
that the Rifkind family has lived in Los Angeles since the turn of the century. 
Los Angeles has been very good to the Rifkind family. It's incumbent upon a 
potential major donor to look at more than one place. I considered other 
institutions that are more prestigious than the County Museum of Art, but I 
liked the idea of having the collection in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Geographic loyalty has exerted such a strong pull that museum officials try to 
extend the concept to such distinguished part-time residents as Walter 
Annenberg, who maintains his primary residence near Philadelphia and a lavish 
estate in Rancho Mirage. Any hopes that Annenberg might donate his 
extraordinary collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings to 
the County Museum of Art are based on the fact that Annenberg has housed his 
collection in Rancho Mirage and that a traveling show of the art is at LACMA 
(to Nov. 11). 
</P>
<P>
Some critics sniff at such a possibility, noting that Los Angeles hasn't landed 
collections that actually have been offered -- much less one that appears to be 
destined for a more prestigious East Coast museum. UCLA lost the Walter C. 
Arensberg collection to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1944 (when the 
university failed to provide a building for the art), for example, and the City 
of Beverly Hills failed to consummate a deal with Joseph H. Hirshhorn in 1964, 
when he considered housing his collection at the Greystone Mansion. The 
Hirshhorn collection went to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where 
it has its own building on the Capitol Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, Los Angeles collector Frederick R. Weisman offered to turn 
Greystone into a contemporary art museum but he backed out in 1986, after the 
city council threatened to sell the mansion to finance public schools and some 
townspeople objected to the specter of increased traffic and unruly 
contemporary art in their high-priced neighborhood. Weisman abandoned his 
search for a museum to house his entire collection and recently gave 33 works 
by contemporary California artists to the San Diego Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles doesn't have a very good track record," but the Arensberg and 
Hirshhorn affairs date to "a time when this was a genuinely provincial place," 
Powell said. "Los Angeles is now quite attractive to collectors. It's the 
second largest city in the United States, soon to be the largest, and it is 
central to the concept of Pacific Rim trade. If you are interested in public 
institutions and the public visibility and recognition that goes with that, as 
well as putting your collection in front of a vast and diverse audience, Los 
Angeles must be a place to consider," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koshalek agreed, adding that people who live elsewhere but do business here are 
beginning to support Los Angeles' cultural institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Joe D. Price collection of Japanese art is the only major out-of-town 
collection to come to LACMA, however, and that gift, made in 1986, was 
contingent upon building a Price-financed pavilion to house the art. Italian 
collector Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's collection of 80 Abstract Expressionist and 
Pop art is MOCA's only far-flung conquest, and it was not donated but purchased 
for $11.5 million in 1984. (MOCA has had notable success in winning L.A.-based 
collections during its short history, including those of Philip and Beatrice 
Gersh, the late Taft and Rita Schreiber, and the late Barry Lowen.) 
</P>
<P>
Geography tends to be an emotional selling point. Credentials and attributes of 
a particular museum are more concrete. Museum officials in pursuit of 
collections promote the virtues of their facilities, programs and staff to 
persuade collectors that their donations will be in good company, properly 
cared for and frequently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that collectors care about is museum architecture, Koshalek said. 
Arata Isozaki's critically acclaimed building on Grand Avenue and Frank Gehry's 
inspired remodeling of the Temporary Contemporary have been enormous assets for 
MOCA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell believes that a construction program also attracts donors by suggesting 
that the museum is moving, change is possible and new collections are welcome. 
"The museum should never be static," said Powell, who has overseen LACMA's 
additions of the Robert O. Anderson building for modern and contemporary art 
and the Pavilion for Japanese Art, as well as an ongoing expansion and 
reordering of gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
Programs also count with collectors. "Prospective donors want to be assured 
that a museum has a full curatorial staff, regular exhibitions and an ongoing 
interest in the area that they collect," Jo Ann Ganz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing collectors want to know is that the art they donate won't end 
up in the basement, that it will be shown and worked with in exhibitions that 
provoke a dialogue in the art community," Koshalek said, citing "Constructing a 
History: A Focus on the Permanent Collection," a MOCA show organized by Ann 
Goldstein, as a recent example. 
</P>
<P>
Curators are another important museum asset, and not only for their scholarly 
credentials. "We typically ask curators to make want lists -- naming what they 
want and where the pieces are located. Part of a curator's job is to know where 
collections are," Powell said. Curators sometimes function as mentors to 
collectors, schooling them in connoisseurship and acting as market advisers. 
"We're very happy to see someone buy a work of art, just to know they made the 
commitment, and we hope that one day it will come to the museum," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally a curator nurtures a private collection from the cradle to the 
altar. Palevsky credits Leslie Bowman, LACMA's curator of decorative arts, with 
doing exactly that. "If it hadn't been for Leslie, this (collection) never 
would have happened. I had bought a few pieces I liked, but I didn't know how 
to distinguish museum quality work," he said. Powell calls Palevsky "the 
perfect donor" because he not only gave 32 Arts and Crafts period works to the 
museum, he permitted Bowman to choose what she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Wooing collectors generally calls for touting a museum's strengths, but 
sometimes it pays to expose a weakness that might be fixed by the perfect gift. 
Los Angeles suitors often implore collectors to be generous to relatively poor 
local institutions instead of giving to East Coast museums that are already 
richly endowed with art. 
</P>
<P>
"This museum is on the cusp of genuine greatness. If the Annenberg collection 
came here, it would have a profound impact, quite unlike what would happen if 
it went to the Met," Powell said. "Were I a collector, I would consider the 
impact my gift would have on the institution." 
</P>
<P>
Another tactic is to solicit specific pieces or to encourage collectors to hone 
their collections and give only pieces that a museum really needs and will 
display. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't help to give duplicates. That's pointless," Jo Ann Ganz said, 
noting that she and her husband have carefully chosen American paintings for 
LACMA that will upgrade the museum's collection and fill in gaps. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going after the best objects from certain collectors," said Julian Ganz 
who is soliciting promised gifts of art for LACMA's 25th birthday exhibition of 
new acquisitions (Oct. 21-Jan. 6, 1991). "We're saying to people who collect in 
depth, why not be represented by one wonderful thing? If they support another 
institution, we ask, why not have one great thing that represents your taste at 
the County Museum of Art?" 
</P>
<P>
The Ganzes have set an example for potential donors by inviting Powell to 
choose one work from their collection as a gift. He selected a jewel, "Boston 
Sunset," a painting by 19th-Century American artist Fitz Hugh Lane. Edward 
Carter -- another longtime supporter who has promised his collection to the 
museum -- has donated "The Great Oaks," a 17th-Century Dutch landscape by Jacob 
van Ruisdael, in honor of the birthday celebration. These paintings will be 
among about 60 works in the exhibition, which is intended not only to mark a 
quarter-century of giving but to spark interest in future patronage. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees such as Julian Ganz at LACMA, Beatrice Gersh and Lenore Greenberg 
(daughter of Taft and Rita Schreiber) at MOCA are particularly helpful in 
bringing in gifts, museum directors say. "Board members play a big role as 
donors and solicitors. They can say, I've done it and you should. That's an 
appropriate role for a trustee," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Artists can also argue effectively for a collector to donate an example of the 
artist's work to a particular museum, Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with changes in income tax laws remains a tough challenge, however. 
LACMA solicitors for the 25th birthday show are asking for promised gifts, to 
be made at the donor's death. "The tax benefits of making a bequest at death 
haven't changed one iota. There's zero tax and the gift doesn't throw you into 
an alternative minimum tax bracket," Ganz said. "We're telling people, the work 
will be away from your house for 90 days for the exhibition, but then you will 
have it until you die." 
</P>
<P>
Promised gifts are being promoted now that most collectors in high income tax 
brackets can only deduct the purchase price and not the appreciated value of 
art gifts. Partial gifts are even more desirable for museums, Koshalek said. 
Under this arrangement, a collector donates fractions of the value of the art 
over time, thus taking a higher deduction than if the art were given at one 
time. One advantage of partial gifts for both museums and collectors is that 
neither party can sell the art without the other's permission. 
</P>
<P>
"There are promised gifts, partial gifts, gift-purchases and endless 
permutations of the ways a collector can donate. Some people just love to 
negotiate and they want to explore all of them. It's part of the ritual," 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials cheerfully discuss all these possibilities with major 
collectors. What Powell calls "heavy restrictions" are generally not negotiable 
at major museums, however. 
</P>
<P>
The most frequently cited impasse in negotiations is a demand for a separate 
empire within a museum. A collector may require that donated works be 
permanently displayed in a separate gallery, as in Frederick Weisman's recent 
gift to the San Diego Museum of Art. Some collectors also want to select a 
personal curator who doesn't report to the museum but who is paid by the 
museum. Another sticking point is a stipulation that donated works can never be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
The history of museum-collector relationships is full of stories about demands 
that have been met or denied. The two most widely criticized examples of going 
overboard to get a collection concern the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the 
Dallas Museum of Art. The Met built an entire wing for the Robert Lehman 
collection and reconstructed rooms from the late investment banker's 54th 
Street mansion to re-create the way he displayed the art. The Dallas museum 
erected a facsimile of Emery and Wendy Reeves' villa in Southern France to win 
the couple's collection of Impressionist paintings and objets d'art. 
</P>
<P>
Armand Hammer, on the other hand, pulled his collection out of the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art when the museum reportedly resisted his requests to hire 
an independent curator, remove other donors' names from galleries containing 
his collection and return some paintings previously given to the museum. Hammer 
has publicly stated that the reason for his pull-out is that the collection had 
grown too large for the museum to display, but museum officials insist that 
they could have accommodated it. Hammer is currently building his own museum in 
Westwood, which is due to open in November. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion on the balance of power between museums and collectors is divided, and 
opinions vary with the quality of a collection. "Collectors shouldn't make 
museums jump through hoops. The joy of a collection is in the doing. Once you 
give it, you should back off and let the professionals take over," Jo Ann Ganz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Rifkind said he learned to be wary of museums many years ago when he 
was a student at Harvard University. "I went to see the Lyonel Feininger 
archive at the Fogg Art Museum and found that it was not organized or 
catalogued. It was a mess. Twenty-five years later when I returned to the 
museum during a reunion, I found that nothing had changed. I couldn't find 
anything, and this is not atypical. 
</P>
<P>
"Museums, with notable exceptions like the Getty and to some extent the 
National Gallery, don't have adequate funds and personnel to take care of major 
collections. I decided if I was going to give something of the magnitude of my 
collection, it had to be of use to scholars. It had to be properly organized 
and catalogued with all the vital information available. Maybe it's my 
compulsive nature, but I just wanted it to be right," Rifkind said. 
</P>
<P>
The result of his conviction is a 99-page contract, negotiated with LACMA over 
a period of nine months. The contract spells out facility and staff 
requirements for the Rifkind Center for the Study of German Expressionism at 
the museum. The museum also agreed to catalogue the vast collection, 
illustrating each piece, within five years of receiving the gift. The hefty, 
two-volume catalogue is now complete. 
</P>
<P>
Some collectors have suggested that if local museums had courted them more 
warmly and shown their collections, they might have donated instead of selling 
when the market was hot. But museum directors insist that they have to guard 
against "investor-collectors" who try to use museum exhibitions to increase the 
value of their art. Except in special cases, such as the Annenberg collection, 
which is packing in crowds at LACMA, major museums will not exhibit private 
collections unless the museum gets something in return -- anything from the 
gift of one work to the entire collection. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectors have a right to discuss everything they want. They should be firm 
but not make unrealistic demands," Julian Ganz said. "To demand that an entire 
collection be displayed in one place can be a burden on a museum and installing 
entire collections intact is passe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But what if Walter Annenberg or Norton Simon suddenly decided to donate his 
collection, provided the museum would accede to a rigid set of restrictions? 
Faced with the unlikely possibility of such a windfall, museum officials roll 
their eyes and start rethinking their concept of unreasonable demands.

THE BATTLE OF MEMPHIS; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S PARENT AGAINST PARENT IN THE DEBATE OVER A CITY LAW THAT SETS STRICT 
LIMITS ON WHAT KIDS ARE ALLOWED TO SEE AT POP CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marilyn Loeffel is a trim, friendly, talkative woman in her late 30s who takes 
her role as a parent seriously. She's careful about the food her two children 
eat, the clothes they wear -- and the music they hear. 
</P>
<P>
"Parenting in the '90s is not just about wiping noses, learning how to sew 
sweet little dresses and baking homemade bread," declared the 37-year-old 
Memphis mother of girls aged 2 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
To Loeffel, parenting in the '90s is also about lobbying for laws that protect 
youngsters from bad influences. 
</P>
<P>
As president of FLARE, a 300-family, self-described "moral concerns" group in 
Memphis, she spends about 50 hours a week delivering speeches, organizing 
letter campaigns and coordinating boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
FLARE -- an acronym that stands for Family Life America Responsible Education 
Under God Inc. -- was instrumental last May in helping to rewrite the Tennessee 
state obscenity code and in passing a Memphis ordinance last summer that 
prohibits dancers at topless bars from getting any closer than 12 inches to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
But when Loeffel's group zeroed in on pop music concerts, it wasn't just people 
in Memphis who noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the Memphis City Council passed what is believed to be the most 
stringent concert content ordinance in the country -- a law that FLARE had long 
demanded. Under the ordinance, any performer, promoter or venue owner who 
knowingly exposes a minor to "harmful material" during a concert in Memphis may 
be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Loeffel celebrated, but her joy wasn't shared by every parent. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McDaniel, an affable, bearded truck driver who lives in the Memphis 
suburb of Bartlett, also considers himself a responsible parent. But he never 
paid much attention to FLARE until the "harmful content" concert law was 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he finds himself embroiled in a legal action against the ordinance that 
Loeffel, whom he still has never met, and FLARE initiated -- an action that is 
the focal point in a national debate. 
</P>
<P>
Like Loeffel, McDaniel, 43, is concerned about the kind of entertainment that 
his four children, aged 10 to 14, see or hear. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel -- who doesn't drink, smoke or take drugs and has been married to his 
second wife for 14 years -- often goes to concerts with them. A hard-rock fan 
who likes such bands as Aerosmith and KISS, McDaniel even previews cassettes 
that the kids bring to the house. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than helping him, McDaniel feels the ordinance interferes with his 
rights as a parent. He specifically objects to a provision that prohibits 
parents and guardians of underage children from allowing minors to attend 
"harmful" concerts. Violators face fines of $50 per infraction. 
</P>
<P>
About the FLARE campaign and the ordinance, he said: "These people are not 
going to tell my children what to do. They don't send them to school, they 
don't buy their clothes, they don't feed them, they don't help them with their 
homework. So what right have they to tell my child what they can or cannot do? 
That's my job and nobody else's." 
</P>
<P>
Though he had never been involved in any type of political or legal action 
previously, McDaniel felt so strongly about the concert law that he contacted 
the American Civil Liberties Union. A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality 
of the ordinance based on the First and 14th amendments was filed on May 10 in 
his behalf by the ACLU in the Western U.S. District Court of Tennessee. Summary 
judgment motions were filed on Aug. 3, and U.S. District Judge Jerome Turner is 
expected to rule on the matter this month. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis City Ordinance No. 3957 combines language from the 1973 Miller U.S. 
Supreme Court decision with text lifted from a "harmful to minor" amendment 
added last spring to the Tennessee obscenity statute. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, concerts considered "harmful to minors" are defined as 
performances that include "any description or representation, in whatever form, 
of nudity, sexual excitement, sexual conduct, excess violence or 
sadomasochistic abuse." 
</P>
<P>
A performance would be in violation of the law if it "predominantly appeals to 
the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors, is patently offensive to 
prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is 
suitable material for minors, and is utterly without redeeming social 
importance for minors." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Moore, the 56-year-old Memphis city councilman who sponsored the measure, 
defended his ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't attempting to legislate morality with this law," Moore said. "But 
enough is enough. Somebody has to stop this garbage from being performed in 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Crain, an attorney for the Rutherford Institute, a Christian civil rights 
legal defense organization, said the Memphis concert ordinance could serve as 
"a model for the nation." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the North American Concert Promoters Assn. calls the ordinance a 
dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance is about repression," association president Carl Freed said. 
"What we have here is Big Brother talking." 
</P>
<P>
The Memphis City Police Department has been given the responsibility of 
enforcing the law. Officers meet with promoters and performers prior to shows 
to explain the boundaries of the city's obscenity codes. Plus, each concert is 
patrolled by a minimum of two officers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has been arrested, even though such controversial acts as 
hard-rockers Aerosmith and KISS as well as rap stars Public Enemy have played 
Memphis since the bill's April 17 passage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cmdr. Mike Dodd, head of the Memphis vice squad, believes it is only a 
matter of time before the ordinance is tested. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, somebody is bound to step over the line," Dodd said in a phone 
interview. "Maybe it will be a performer, maybe it will be a parent, but 
somewhere down the road, someone will go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the "harmful material" concert ordinance was conceived 10 years 
ago by Loeffel's group. Founded in 1980 to "fight moral pollution and protect 
the family," FLARE is affiliated with several influential political and 
religious leaders in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Adrian Rogers, one of the most prominent Southern Baptist leaders in the 
country, sits on FLARE'S advisory board. Notable political figures such as 
Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly, former Atty. Gen. Ed Meese and Bob 
DeMoss, youth specialist for the Pomona-based Focus on the Family, are often 
featured as speakers at the organization's yearly Christian fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, but when it comes to restricting the spread of pornography, I am my 
brother's keeper," Loeffel said. "What we do is a very thankless job. It's like 
cleaning toilets. I cannot understand how people have allowed things to get 
this bad, especially Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at is if a neighbor down the street is performing some kind of 
child abuse and I am made aware of it -- whether it be mental, physical, sexual 
or whatever -- the state expects me to report that parent, doesn't it? Well 
what about the moral abuse of a child?" 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Memphis ordinance is being viewed with urgency by music industry 
observers is that several arrests for concert obscenity have taken place this 
year around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies in various U.S. cities are reinterpreting obscenity 
provisions in existing penal codes to arrest entertainers who perform 
"explicit" material. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, Fla., several members of the Miami rap group 2 Live Crew and a 
rock group called Too Much Joy were arrested last summer on separate occasions 
for performing "obscene" material at adult clubs. 2 Live Crew's case goes to 
trial Tuesday in Ft. Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 12 months, several prominent pop-rock artists have been arrested 
in separate Georgia incidents for "suggestive" performances -- including Bobby 
Brown, LL Cool J, Motley Crue's Tommy Lee, KISS leader Gene Simmons and Kid N' 
Play. All simply paid nominal fines, about $500 per infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, David Murray Brockie, the lead singer of the theatrical 
heavy-metal band GWAR (which plays the Hollywood Palladium on Friday), was 
arrested after a Sept. 18 concert at the 4808 Club in Charlotte, N.C., on a 
felony charge of "disseminating obscenities." 
</P>
<P>
But no statute in the nation so specifically targets controversial concert 
performances as the new Memphis law. 
</P>
<P>
Although FLARE campaigned 10 years for a concert content law, it wasn't until 
last February, when Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee mooned the audience during a 
concert at Memphis' Mid-South Coliseum, that momentum for the ordinance began 
to build. 
</P>
<P>
Loeffel said her organization received help from such leading media watchdog 
organizations as the Rev. Donald Wildmon's Tupelo-based American Family Assn., 
the Nashville branch of Focus on the Family and the Rutherford Institute to 
help push the measure forward. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia-based Rutherford Institute helped design the American Family 
Assn.'s legal attack against the film "The Last Temptation of Christ" and has 
also provided legal defense in numerous anti-abortion cases. 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize the issue, FLARE targeted a Memphis appearance last April of 
notorious Miami rappers 2 Live Crew, whose "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album 
was later declared obscene by a federal judge in Ft. Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
Before the concert, FLARE members distributed copies of lyrics from the "Nasty" 
album to parents at area schoolyards and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, City Council chairman Jimmy Moore -- who had been working on the 
proposal since 1988 -- engaged city attorney Brady Bratusch to help draft an 
ordinance with "some teeth in it." 
</P>
<P>
FLARE suggested that the city attorney's office contact Larry Crain of the 
Rutherford Institute to help draft a constitutionally correct proposal. The 
concert ordinance passed the City Council by a margin of 10 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
"All we wanted was something that would force parents to go and see for 
themselves how bad things have gotten so that they would be able to make a more 
educated decision on what their children are being exposed to," Loeffel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought that after 10 years of not getting anything done, that they 
would pass a law that would go this far. But we're glad they did. It's better 
than anything we ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
Promoters are not alone in opposing the Memphis ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
On May 4, Robert Eugene Crain, director of the Germantown Community Theatre and 
no relation to attorney Larry Crain, filed a lawsuit against the city of 
Memphis in the Western U.S. District Court of Tennessee charging that the "live 
performance" ordinance deprived parents of their right to determine what 
performances their children may attend. 
</P>
<P>
Six days later, the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee filed a similar 
lawsuit on behalf of McDaniel. U.S. District Judge Jerome Turner consolidated 
the two suits on May 16. The suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and 
compensatory damages suffered for deprivation of constitutional rights plus 
court costs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two parents who are principal figures in this case remain 
adamant about their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not just Puritans who have never been affected," Loeffel said. "Not 
just some pack of holier-than-thou, self-righteous people living in little 
ivory towers. We got involved in this because members of our families have been 
hurt and we don't want to see it happen to somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Still, McDaniel, who said he filed the suit because he feared he might face 
arrest for taking his daughter to a recent Aerosmith concert, maintains the 
ordinance is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, as long as I live in America, it should be my choice as to 
which cotton-picking concerts my children should be able to attend," McDaniel 
said. "If I don't deem it harmful to them, by George then they ought to have 
the right to go."

Oxnard police officers shot and killed a man who had threatened a La Colonia 
family Saturday evening after the man pointed a handgun at the officers, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jeff Young said several officers responded to a call that a man was drunk 
and waving a gun at a Hayes Avenue residence. 
</P>
<P>
"Several officers were talking with the woman at the front of her residence 
when the man exited the house carrying a weapon in his hand," Young said. "He 
was confronted by the police and then the shooting occurred." 
</P>
<P>
The man, whom police had not identified by late Saturday, was wounded several 
times in the legs and at least once in the head, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant said he did not know if the man, who was about 50 years old, had 
fired at the officers. 
</P>
<P>
The man died almost immediately and was taken to the Ventura County coroner's 
office for an autopsy, which is scheduled for this morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting ended a confrontation that began when the man arrived at the Hayes 
Avenue residence and began threatening the family, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one at the residence knew who he was. They'd seen him around and he knew 
someone who lived there, but his acquaintance was not there at the time," Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told the lady he was going to start killing people," said a neighbor who 
identified himself only as Max. 
</P>
<P>
He said the woman and her two young children had fled to his house. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman called for help about 6 p.m. and was still on the 
telephone when officers arrived. Neighbors said they heard no shots until 
police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Saul Rivas, who lives at the Angel Hotel across the street from the house, 
said: "I was watching TV, and I heard like firecrackers: Boom! Boom! Boom! 
Boom! About four times. When I came out the guy was already dead." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place on a street dotted with two restaurants and four bars 
and in a neighborhood that has one of the highest crime rates in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses were taken to the Oxnard police station and interviewed, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the coroner's and district attorney's offices responded to 
the shooting. The district attorney's office investigates all shootings 
involving police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Young said there was at least one fatal shooting by an Oxnard officer last 
year.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MAN, YOUTH HELD IN STABBINGS AT BEACH 
</P>

<P>
Detectives have arrested a Saticoy man and a Ventura teen-ager in connection 
with the beach stabbings of two Ojai teen-agers last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Mendez Lopez, 26, is being held at the Ventura County Jail on suspicion 
of violating his parole. 
</P>
<P>
Police plan to charge him with attempted murder on Tuesday, said Detective 
Douglas Auldridge of the Ventura Police Department. The 15-year-old is being 
held at Juvenile Hall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both were questioned on the night of the stabbing but were released because 
police had inadequate evidence, Auldridge said. After an investigation, he and 
Detective Pat Stevens arrested Lopez at his home about 11 a.m. Friday and the 
teen-ager about 4 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, who police believe associates with members of a Ventura gang 
called the Avenue Gangsters, is the main suspect, Auldridge said. It is unclear 
whether the attack was gang-related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One stabbing victim, 15-year-old David Foyle, remains in critical condition in 
the Ventura County Medical Center with more than 20 stab wounds, Auldridge and 
a hospital spokeswoman said. David and a companion, Brady Sabat, 19, were 
beaten with sticks and stabbed repeatedly at the beach across from Ventura 
Harbor about 12:10 a.m. last Sunday. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SAME MAN MAY HAVE ATTACKED 3 WOMEN 
</P>

<P>
The man who raped an Ojai woman Thursday morning could be responsible for two 
other assaults in the Ojai area this year, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it might be the same person. 
</P>
<P>
If we get him identified, it could tie them all together. But until we do, we 
can't say for sure," said Sgt. Tom Odle of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of the three attacks have given similar descriptions of their 
assailant, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is described as in his mid-20s, slender, about 5 feet 6 inches tall 
with light brown skin, dark brown hair and brown or hazel eyes. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a 25-year-old Ojai woman reported that she was raped about 1:30 
a.m. after she was dragged into a downtown mini-mall at the corner of Aliso and 
North Signal streets. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told police that she made a call from a public phone on Matilija 
Street and was walking back to her apartment when she was accosted, Odle said. 
When the man let her go, he drove away in a yellow car, Odle said. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, a 20-year-old Meiners Oaks woman was jogging through a field on 
Maricopa Highway north of Nordhoff High School in mid-afternoon when a man 
grabbed her. 
</P>
<P>
Passersby heard her screams and ran to help her. The man rode off on a yellow 
mountain bike and eluded deputies. 
</P>
<P>
On June 24, deputies who answered a resident's call of hearing screams about 9 
p.m. encountered a woman struggling with a man on the ground in Nordhoff 
Cemetery at Cuyama and Del Norte roads. The man fled. 
</P>
<P>
That 25-year-old woman told police that her car broke down and that she was 
looking for a phone when the man dragged her into the cemetery. THIA BELL

OPPORTUNITY FOR TAGLIABUE TO TAKE CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue of female sportswriters in the locker rooms of the National Football 
League was debated last week by everyone from Phil Donahue to Sam Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
Within the NFL, though, there is a much larger issue: Who's going to run the 
league? 
</P>
<P>
When Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche barred Denise Tom of USA Today from his 
locker room Monday night and announced that he would close his locker room 
Sunday to all reporters after 20 minutes, he was blatantly defying league 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who has had a reputation in his first year in 
office of not acting quickly or decisively, took a first step toward getting 
control of the league when he fined Wyche a game check -- a little less than 
$30,000 -- and informed him that he cannot close the locker room after 20 
minutes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
That's only a first step, though. Tagliabue has to make it clear to the players 
-- and some coaches -- the importance of media relations to the league. 
</P>
<P>
Even the league admits that this has become a public relations nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened has given us a real bad black eye," said Joe Browne, a 
league spokesman. "The good news is that anything that happens in the NFL is 
major news. But this is an embarrassment to this league and to the overwhelming 
majority of clubs." 
</P>
<P>
The league, though, has nobody to blame but itself for this problem. It has 
allowed its media relations to deterioriate in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
When Jim McMahon blew his nose on a male reporter in San Diego last year, it 
was treated as a joke. In San Francisco, when the locker room is opened during 
the week, Joe Montana and several other high profile athletes are usually 
hiding and unavailable for interviews. Reporters finally asked if Montana could 
be made available one day during the week. Even that was denied. When reporters 
complained to the league, nothing was done about it. 
</P>
<P>
The league created this atmosphere by letting the players think that they can 
do whatever they want. It was just a matter of time before things got out of 
control, and in New England, they finally went over the edge and sexually 
harassed Lisa Olson, a Boston Herald sportswriter. 
</P>
<P>
As far as women in the locker room, that's not an issue worth debating. Equal 
access is the law. 
</P>
<P>
As far as banning both sexes from the locker room and having an interview room, 
it's not feasible in many stadiums because they weren't designed with interview 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they are available, the real story is in the locker room. Even some 
players and coaches understand that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the best time to get the rush and feel the experience to help 
you guys write the story," said Darryl Grant of the Washington Redskins. "After 
people have calmed down, the effect is not the same. I understand it from that 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets Coach Bruce Coslet, who worked for Wyche in Cincinnati said, "The 
big point is you guys have to get your stories when emotions are hot, right 
after a game. That's the best time to get the stories and I appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, the league isn't doing the reporters a favor by letting 
them into the locker room. It's in the league's best interests to have vivid 
stories about the games. 
</P>
<P>
The real question now is whether the league can reverse the current trend and 
put more emphasis on media relations. It sends representatives to the clubs 
during training camp to talk about drugs and gambling. The league's image is 
just as important but all it does is send the teams a 7 1/2-minute video on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that it is harder to get through to the players these days. In 
Pittsburgh, the team is having enough trouble getting the players to accept Joe 
Walton's passing offense, much less be concerned about the media. 
</P>
<P>
In taking action against Wyche Friday -- even though it should have been done 
three days earlier -- Tagliabue showed interest in correcting the problem. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the league is now going to start taking the problem 
seriously or just wait for the next disaster to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue has to show now if he plans to run the league or if he's going to let 
the players and coaches be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
It was overshadowed by Wyche's banning of Tom, but one of the more heartwarming 
comeback stories of the year was played out in the Seattle Kingdome Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Seahawks' Derrick Fenner, the former North Carolina running back 
who spent 44 days in jail on murder charges in 1987 that were later dropped, 
but pleaded guilty to a drug charge and was put on probation, ran for 144 yards 
in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Fenner said that he considered suicide when he was in jail, but then he'd think 
about getting out and playing football again. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself, 'This is going to be a great story,"' he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was a great story. For about 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The night after his big game in the Kingdome, he was in trouble again. Fenner, 
whose probation does not run expire until February, was accused of hitting and 
kicking a man in a restaurant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed and the incident is still under police 
investigation, but it was another setback for Fenner. The Seahawks also had to 
pay between $1,300 and $1,400 to a rental car company last week that Fenner 
owed on two cars he leased last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Fenner is back running well on the field, but he still has to work on his 
problems off the field. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rams signed Marcus DuPree last week, that was the start of what could 
even be a better comeback than Fenner's. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be like 'The Natural,' wouldn't it," Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
DuPree is one of those mythical, what-might-have-been stories in pro football. 
He came out of high school in Philadelphia, Miss. -- yes the town of 
"Mississippi Burning" where the civil rights workers were killed -- touted as 
one of the sport's greatest running backs. A book was written about the way he 
was recruited. 
</P>
<P>
But his was the classic case of too much too soon. Even at Oklahoma, where 
Coach Barry Switzer wasn't noted for enforcing any rules, he wasn't happy. He 
left in his sophomore year, enrolled at Southern Missisippi and then jumped to 
the New Orleans Breakers of the United States Football League in 1984 and 
rushed for 681 yards on 145 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 24, 1985, in the Breakers' first game after they moved to Portland, Ore., 
he suffered what was thought to be a career-ending knee injury. Lloyd's of 
London even paid out $4.3 million, its largest payout ever for an athlete. The 
club held the policy, and was bankrupt so DuPree wound up with only $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was in college, he was O.J. Simpson, Bo Jackson, Eric Dickerson. 
That's the caliber of kid he was," said Dick Coury, who was the Breakers' head 
coach and is now an assistant with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's trying to make it back five years later. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting down watching Super Bowls go by and I want to play in a Super 
Bowl," DuPree said. "Plus, I have two little boys and they got excited when 
they watched Oklahoma videotapes. I want them to see their dad play." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Rams are taking a gamble and have no idea if he can still play. 
It's hard enough to come back after a five-year layoff, much less after a 
serious knee injury five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"But you think ... what if?" Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
It's an intriguing, 'what if?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Accorsi, the executive vice president of the Cleveland Browns, and Stan 
White, the agent for Browns cornerback Frank Minnifield, have known each other 
for 18 years since White joined the Baltimore Colts as a linebacker in 1972 
when Accorsi was in the team's front office. 
</P>
<P>
But Minnifield's bitter holdout -- he signed last week but said he's filing an 
antitrust suit against the league -- has strained their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
White said that he hopes it improves "after the dust settles" and said that 
each man was just doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
Accorsi declined to comment because White is threatening litigation, but said 
that he'd have a lot to say about White when the suit was over. From the tone 
of Accorsi's voice, you get the idea what he'll have to say about White won't 
be too complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
Minnifield lost almost $300,000 by turning down an offer from the Atlanta 
Falcons and signing after four games with the Browns. It remains to be seen if 
he makes it up in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Stats to note: The unbeaten Raiders have tried only 70 passes, fewest in the 
league, but Jay Schroeder has thrown only one that was intercepted and has 
thrown 67 straight passes without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Cunningham of the Philadelphia Eagles is already the third-leading 
rusher among quarterbacks with 2,662 yards. He trails only Fran Tarkenton 
(3,674) and Tobin Rote (3,128) on the all-time list. The main reason for the 
Eagles' poor start is that they're not coming up with turnoverrs. Last year, 
they led the league with plus-24 in that category. This year, they're 
minus-four. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be a new statistic to watch this week: how teams coming off byes fare 
against teams that played last week. The Los Angeles Rams, who play the 
Bengals, and the San Francisco 49ers, who play the Houston Oilers, are in that 
category. The other two teams that had byes last week, Atlanta and New Orleans, 
play each other. 
</P>
<P>
If the teams coming off a bye week start racking up a lot of wins, that could 
be a new handicapping factor. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Meyer escaped the hot seat for a week when the Indianapolis Colts stunned 
the Eagles, but the man he beat, Buddy Ryan, and Bud Carson of the Browns 
replaced him as the two coaches who are in the most trouble. Jerry Burns of 
Minnesota is right behind. Ryan has a bye and Burns has a home game with 
Detroit, so they may get some breathing room, but Carson has a Monday night 
game in Denver. The Browns were busy denying reports last week that Carson 
could be on the way out, but if they get blown out in Denver, owner Art Modell 
could lose his patience. 
</P>
<P>
When Modell hired Carson a year ago, he said it was his last coaching change. 
He may be having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
There were four penalties called against offensive tackle Tony Mandarich of the 
Green Bay Packers, who was the second player taken in last year's draft, last 
Sunday against the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive line coach Charlie Davis said: "Is he a good pass blocker? No, he's 
not. I'd be crazy to say that he was. Will he become a better pass blocker? 
Yes, I think he will." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers have to hope so.

HE IS FRAGILE BUT UNBREAKABLE

LAKE FOREST, Ill.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shake hands with Dan Hampton and it seems each of his gnarled fingers points in 
a different direction. His ankles have to be taped excessively so they won't 
buckle. He has had 15 broken bones, more than 300 stitches. And that doesn't 
count any of the 10 knee operations, five on each leg. There's no cartilage at 
all in the right one. When he walks, he describes the feeling as roughly akin 
to miniature ball bearings grinding against one another. Wife Terri has to help 
him get dressed some mornings. He doesn't ask; she just senses he can't and 
goes over to the sock drawer. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly Hampton jokes about his knees and his fingers and his bad back. "Some 
guys are like a '57 Corvette with 3,000 miles and in mint condition," he said. 
"I'm like an '89 model with 400,000 miles. ... Before last season I had five 
(operations) on one knee, three on the other. I was off-balance. The last two 
operations were like getting a realignment. I've got balance." 
</P>
<P>
But in a moment of candor, Hampton said: "I don't think it's any secret that I 
feel awful all the time. I'm beat to death. I knew in the fall of last year, if 
I decided to do it again, I'd have to do it with my teeth gritted." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, he has come back for his 12th season, his last. He is the only 
Chicago Bear besides Sid Luckman to play in three decades. He came back because 
all indications are that the Bears aren't the Bears without him. They are 2-11 
with him out of the starting lineup the last two seasons, 7-0 with him in it. 
The Bears were 4-0 last year when he had to leave for the season, for the ninth 
and 10th knee operations. Michael McCaskey, the club CEO, hinted Hampton should 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
Why would a man whose wife has to dress him come back and play again? 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have retired that way," he said this week before a practice session 
at Halas Hall. "I would have had serious problems doing that. Even though this 
is not my house, the house was in a mess (6-10 last year) and I wanted to help 
clean it." 
</P>
<P>
So here is Hampton, 6-foot-5, 270 pounds, a boulder of a man, arguably the best 
defensive tackle of his generation. As close as he is to the Hall of Fame, he's 
just as close to becoming Jim Otto, the former Raider who can barely walk now 
because of degenerative injuries to his knees. However, they are his knees, and 
if he wants to risk his health beyond the age of 33 that's his decision, and 
his decision alone. 
</P>
<P>
After his first game this season, reporters gathered around Hampton's locker. 
"I know where you people are coming from," he said. "You're trying to mother 
me. But I'd wish you just lighten up. I don't have a two-digit IQ. I'm going to 
go for as hard as I can as long as I can, and when it's over I'll know it. But 
I ain't there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walsh, the 49ers coach turned television analyst, thinks Hampton is there. 
And he said so, over and over again, during the Bears-Seahawks telecast. When 
Hampton got in on one sack, Walsh said: "I hate to see Hampton get the sack 
because it means he'll think he can still play. He shouldn't play football; 
everybody knows it. Even the sportswriters aren't writing of it. People are 
fascinated. The guy is continuing to play rather than being concerned about his 
health. He doesn't belong on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, so loquacious and opinionated the TV execs can't wait for him to 
retire, shot back at Walsh: "He has an awfully high opinion of who he is. The 
49ers really missed him last year, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
And when Walsh laid the blame on Coach Mike Ditka for letting Hampton come 
back, Hampton fired another volley: "I can remember when Joe Montana came back 
(54) days after back surgery and a lot of doctors said if he gets another shot 
in the back he would be crippled for life. Walsh didn't tell him not to go out 
there. I think he is a big hypocrite and he is a fool." 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, it's almost a Bears tradition to have to negotiate a 
staircase like a 2 year old before calling it quits. Ditka has one replacement 
hip and needs another. Dick Butkus, who played through several knee operations, 
drags one leg. Gayle Sayers, who came back to lead the league in rushing after 
a serious knee injury, still looks 35 but moves like he's 75. 
</P>
<P>
So why doesn't Hampton quit now, and perhaps be able to play catch with his 
kids in 10 years? "The only thing I look forward to, seriously, is playing golf 
and swimming," he said the other day, addressing The Otto Question once more. 
"Throwing the football or baseball with a kid, hell, I couldn't do that at 50 
if I had gotten out in 1985. The point of getting out (healthy) passed a long 
time ago. At this point, we're talking about four, five, maybe eight percent 
more damage. ... 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to run 12 miles every morning when I'm 50. ... I don't want to do 
that now." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears think enough of him that he would be the highest-paid defensive 
player on the team if he reaches those incentives. They also protected him from 
Plan B, knowing that more than Neal Anderson, more than Mike Singletary, maybe 
as much as Ditka he is what the Bears are: tough and unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I respect what he's trying to do on those knees? Absolutely," Ditka said. 
"Dan would never do anything to embarrass himself on this team. There's no need 
to. He's been too great a player. When it's time, it's time, if you know what I 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
So now, the questions are about playing. Hampton is part of a three-man 
rotation with William Perry and Steve McMichael. "Sort of like WWF (World 
Wrestling Federation); Ming the Merciless, the Refrigerator and Danimal," he 
said. "Except we don't have to tag each other when we come off the field." 
</P>
<P>
He is upset that he can't practice regularly. He's on the field now for about 
30 plays a game instead of 60 or more, and gives himself only a C-plus through 
four games. That has him "in the doldrums. I'm not playing bad, I'm not playing 
great. There is an attrition point in the career of any player. In '86 and '87, 
I was dominating. I can't do that now and it's bothering me." 
</P>
<P>
Bear watchers are convinced that his ability to cave in the middle of the 
offensive line, even now, enabled Trace Armstrong and Richard Dent to record 
nine sacks in the first three games. Last Sunday, with Hampton in for very few 
snaps, it's no coincidence the Bears had just one sack. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who thinks that I am going to be as effective in my 12th year as I was 
in my fifth or sixth year would have to be examined," he said. "But I feel like 
I really should improve here in the next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has had fluid drained from his knees since the start of the season, 
he smiles and says: "No comment. ... Ten years from now they'll say, 'Do you 
miss football?' And I'll say, 'No.' No qualms, no complaints. The most 
satisfying thing is that I'm leaving on my own terms." 
</P>
<P>
On his own knees.

BACKUPS EARNING THEIR DUE IN NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The other football players refer to him as "The Guy," and you can hear the 
capital "T" and the capital "G" when they speak. 
</P>
<P>
As in, "The Guy who is going to get it done for us. The Guy we can count on to 
get us into the end zone. The Guy who is going to get us to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Montana, Marino, Majik, Everett, Elway. These are The Guys. 
</P>
<P>
But behind these great quarterbacks are "The Other Guys." 
</P>
<P>
The backups. 
</P>
<P>
They may be wizened veterans or marginal talents or heirs apparent. You might 
catch a glimpse of them during a timeout, eavesdropping on a sideline 
conversation between The Guy and The Coach. They are easy to spot with their 
baseball caps, their clean uniforms and their clipboards. 
</P>
<P>
You won't hear much about them unless disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are the second-most important position on the team," Cleveland 
Browns' Vice President Ernie Accorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a franchise quarterback to compete in this league," Accorsi said. 
"But the other guy can take you out of contention faster than any other player 
on the field if he can't at least hold his own." 
</P>
<P>
Babe Laufenberg, who has been a backup for six years with the Washington 
Redskins, San Diego Chargers, New Orleans Saints and now the Dallas Cowboys, 
likes to be referred to as a "journeyman." 
</P>
<P>
"The dictionary defines that as someone competent but unspectacular," 
Laufenberg said. "People think of it as a derogatory term, but it is not. We 
are guys who won't go in and lose a game for you." 
</P>
<P>
Untapped competence, if not unexposed excellence, is only one of the traits a 
backup quarterback must have. He must also have his ego firmly in check. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad asked me once if I could get him an autographed football," said Gary 
Kubiak, backup to John Elway with the Denver Broncos. "And he asked me 
especially if I could get John's signature on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Dad ...' " 
</P>
<P>
Only six quarterbacks among the league's 28 teams started all 16 games last 
season. This season is only four weeks old, and already starters are falling: 
Washington's Mark Rypien, the Minnesota Vikings' Wade Wilson, the Indianapolis 
Colts' Jeff George, the New England Patriots' Steve Grogan and the Detroit 
Lions' Rodney Peete. 
</P>
<P>
And it is clear from their price tags that the National Football League places 
a premium on the quarterbacks who must hold it together until The Guy returns. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the ways you keep them happy," said Accorsi, who pays Mike Pagel 
$550,000 a year to be ready in case something happens to Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
"He is worth every penny to us," Accorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
Pagel earned his keep in 1988 when he was 4-2 as a starter for the injured 
Kosar and Cleveland made it to the playoffs as a wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reich performed as well for the Buffalo Bills last year and was rewarded 
in May with a five-year deal worth $600,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The former Maryland quarterback was nearly cut in training camp, but he came 
off the bench for an injured Jim Kelly in a nationally televised game against 
the Los Angeles Rams in Week 6 and moved the team down the field to score the 
winning touchdown with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
Reich led the Bills to victories over the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins 
the next two weeks, and his team, too, made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That three-game stretch earned Reich more than a pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing it did for me was give me a little respect among my peers, which 
is important," Reich said. "As a quarterback, you need that respect when you 
step out on the field. And those three games gave me that." 
</P>
<P>
Money will not always keep a backup quarterback happy. After all, most of them 
were The Guy during their college careers. It is not easy to stand and chart 
plays when once you called them. 
</P>
<P>
"Pagel started 40 games for the Colts," Accorsi said. "He's still young and 
he's antsy." 
</P>
<P>
Reich is, too. "A little bit," he said. "Especially after having some success 
... it gives you that hunger to get back in there -- just because it is so much 
fun playing." 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to keep everybody happy," said George Young, vice president of 
the New York Giants. He pays Jeff Hostetler $450,000 to back up 35-year-old 
Phil Simms. Hostetler is 29. He might not have much time left for his career if 
Simms doesn't retire soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The age thing has to be just right," Young said. "You either have to have a 
veteran behind a young guy or a real young heir apparent who knows he's going 
to get his chance some day. Real close together in age and you have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Consider Tony Eason. The seven-year veteran forfeited a week's pay -- $68,000 
-- rather than report to the Jets, who had picked him up on waivers, because he 
did not want to compete against his contemporary, and best friend, Ken O'Brien. 
O'Brien eventually persuaded him to report. 
</P>
<P>
A similar age problem between two younger players was resolved in Dallas last 
month when the Cowboys traded Steve Walsh, on the bench behind Troy Aikman, to 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Add resolution, and a good grip on reality, to the list of qualities that you 
look for in your backup. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Bubby's The Guy," the Pittsburgh Steelers' Rick Strom said. "And I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Brister has failed to produce a touchdown in four games using the offense 
designed by new coordinator Joe Walton. Strom took over for Brister late in 
last week's 28-6 loss to Miami. After taking a sack, Strom completed a 22-yard 
pass for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to complete four straight passes and move the Steelers to the 
Dolphins' 1-yard line with a minute left. A penalty, a sack and two 
incompletions ended the drive. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how well he had done in what are clearly desperate times for the 
Steelers, he does not expect Coach Chuck Noll to replace Brister with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pulling for the team to come out of this," Strom said. "I can't be 
concerned with whether I am playing or not. I have one job here. If Bubby goes 
down, I have to come in and take over so we don't miss a beat. You can't be 
prepared to do that if you spend your time on the sideline pouting." 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak, Elway's best friend and roommate since both joined the Broncos eight 
years ago, knows his role, too. 
</P>
<P>
Elway is perhaps the most durable quarterback in the NFL over the past five 
years, starting 85 of the past 87 games. Kubiak gets few turns at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, I am not The Guy, and I won't be as long as John is around," Kubiak 
said. "When you are in that position, you have to be very self-motivated, very 
disciplined. You are not going to get the physical preparation, so you have to 
make up for it with mental preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Said a member of the Broncos front office: "Kubiak is the perfect backup. He is 
not a threat or a challenge (the way Walsh was to Aikman). He is never going to 
say, 'Play me or trade me.' Over a 16-game season, his weaknesses would be 
exposed. But to come in for a game or two, he is perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The role of the backup quarterback in the history of the NFL is not ignominious 
or anonymous. Earl Morrall replaced John Unitas and led the Baltimore Colts to 
a 13-1 record in the 1968 season. Morrall held the starting job until Unitas 
came off the bench in the third quarter of the Colts' loss to the Jets in Super 
Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
Again in 1972, during the Dolphins' 17-0 Super Bowl season, Morrall replaced an 
injured Bob Griese during Week 5. Griese did not return until he came off the 
bench to rally the Dolphins past Pittsburgh for the American Football 
Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
And Mike Kruczek was 6-0 in place of Terry Bradshaw, helping the Steelers make 
the playoffs in 1976. But no backup quarterback ever has been the winning 
quarterback in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And whether they are like Mike Tomczak of the Bears or Eason of the Jets or the 
Green Bay Packers' Anthony Dilweg, who knew he would be benched as soon as Don 
Majkowski ended his holdout ("They aren't paying him $1.5 million to sit on the 
bench," Dilweg said), each wonders what it would be like to be The Guy.

WESTSIDE HOME SELLERS GET A DOSE OF REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: SOFT MARKET HAS OWNERS REDUCING PRICES, ENDURING LONG WAITS. BUT 
DON'T BREAK OUT THE HANKIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No more long lines of wild-eyed clients writing checks on the sidewalk. No more 
open-ended bidding wars. No more weekend frenzies involving capacity crowds at 
open houses. 
</P>
<P>
Reality has set in on Southland real estate -- even on the property-rich 
Westside, where last year the $340,000 two-bedroom, one-bath fixer became a 
familiar part of the coastal landscape. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts and real estate agents say it's not quite time to break out the 
hankies for property owners in the Westside and other high-end housing areas. 
While home prices in other parts of the country are sliding down like pinballs, 
Westside real estate still remains decidedly out of reach for most. However, 
for the first time in years, a soft market has led to a glut of homes for sale, 
forcing sellers to reduce prices or face long waits as potential buyers hunt 
for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than predicting doom -- the latest Newsweek cover story focuses on the 
national real estate bust -- economists say that there will continue to be a 
gradual decline in the California housing market, although the cycle may shift 
again by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening now is very predictable, since real estate is such a cyclical 
industry," said Michael Salkin, an economist and senior vice president at First 
Interstate Bank. "We haven't seen the bottom yet, but I don't think it will 
slip much further. The market will bottom out, and then it will shift upwards 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Salkin said the low end of the market, which on the Westside means homes in the 
$300,000 to $400,000 range, will continue to do reasonably well, whereas the 
higher-priced models, between $400,000 and $1 million, will move very slowly 
during the ongoing recession. 
</P>
<P>
That assessment is borne out by the latest figures on single-family home sales 
reported through multiple-listing services. The "more affordable" Westside 
homes -- ones in Westchester, Culver City, Mar Vista and West Hollywood -- sold 
more quickly, and proportionally closer to their asking price, than other more 
expensive Westside properties. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with the frenzied market last year, however, homes in those 
neighborhoods remained on the market nearly a month longer. Real estate agents 
in those communities, searching for ways to deal in a buyers market, say they 
are increasingly turning to lease options or asking sellers to price their 
homes for a quick sale. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the million-dollar mansions in Beverly Hills, Bel-Air, 
Malibu, Pacific Palisades and Brentwood show a widening discrepancy between 
asking and selling prices. In Beverly Hills, the difference was $1.1 million; 
the listing and selling gap for a Malibu beach house was $1.7 million. Figures 
compiled by Jon Douglas Co. show that the average single-family home in those 
communities remains on the market an average of four months, nearly 40% longer 
than during the third quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown, analysts agree that the market for homes priced over $1 
million remains largely recession-proof, since those rich enough to afford 
those estates are rarely concerned about their next paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"In a normal world, where people have regular jobs and work every day, the 
market is weak," said Burl East, a securities analyst at Bateman, Eichler, Hill 
and Richards. "When you're dealing with homes $1 million and up, it's not Buffy 
and Chip working as lawyers anymore. You're talking about people whose 
financial status is not driven by normal parameters. These are newly minted 
starlets and people concerned about whether their latest movie is a hit. I call 
it the la-la factor." 
</P>
<P>
Agents working in the "estate divisions" for large real estate firms say the 
general slowdown has been fueled in part by homeowners reluctant to sell unless 
they get a large profit -- the offshoot of the frenzy that saw people bidding 
much more than the asking price during the 1988-89 peak. 
</P>
<P>
"People are still moving, but it's just not booming like it was," said Elaine 
Young, a partner with Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young. "When it's slow, people just 
spend more time looking for great buys. But recently, I've noticed that a lot 
of speculators have begun buying again, and that usually indicates a good 
market is not far off." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the current economy is just forcing Westside homeowners to accept 
a simple fact in the post-boom market: They can no longer expect an annual 25% 
appreciation in their houses. Still, they say, if homeowners bought their 
properties well before the peak last year, they will probably still earn a 
sterling profit when they sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very time-specific and very geographic-specific," said Salkin, who 
also serves as the risk manager for the real estate division at First 
Interstate. "If you bought right at the peak, then obviously you won't make as 
much money, and you might hold on to your property longer. And million-dollar 
homes in Beverly Hills and Bel-Air will always hold their value because 
industrialists and capitalists from all over the world want to live there." 
</P>
<P>
Since there is little room for new housing on the Westside, the demand will 
continue to outpace the supply, keeping prices out of reach for all but 10% of 
the residents in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say that as long as interest rates are down, prices won't drop that 
much, so a home selling for $350,000 during the peak months probably won't go 
for less than $325,000 in the current market. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices are just returning to real life," East said. "During the peak, they 
just got way out of line. But when the economy rebounds, the trend will shift, 
and prices will rise again." 
</P>
<P>
And if that happens, the average beach home in Malibu will list for more than 
$3 million. The average single-family home in Santa Monica will approach $1 
million. And modest homes in former blue-collar communities such as Westchester 
will cost $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Holding the geographic location constant in the real estate market, there will 
always be a tremendous demand for housing (in the Westside)," Salkin said. "The 
problem is affordability."

DEAL STRUCK FOR LIBRARY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County may finally get the land it needs to build a new library in 
Hacienda Heights, after promising to pay a local school district $40,000 a year 
for the use of school property, make hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
library improvements, and help maintain a school swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
It took 2 1/2 years to develop the library deal, which was strongly urged by 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who represents Hacienda Heights, an unincorporated 
community. The accord still requires approval by the Hacienda La Puente School 
Board and the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-square-foot library would be built on a playground at Dibble School, 
which has been closed as an elementary school since 1984 and is being used for 
adult classes and other educational programs. The county is applying for state 
funding under Proposition 85, the library bond initiative, to offset some of 
the new library's $7.6-million price. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District had been reluctant 
to lease the land to the county for several reasons. They said the county's 
previous offer of $15,000 a year was extremely low compared with the $275,000 a 
year that the land would bring if leased to a commercial developer. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some school board members said they wanted to leave the playground 
undeveloped in case the elementary school ever reopened. Some pointed to plans 
for a performing arts center, also proposed for the site. 
</P>
<P>
But district Supt. James Johnson agreed to lease the site after the county made 
some concessions. The district found that it probably wouldn't need to reopen 
the elementary school any time soon, and decided there was enough room on the 
playground for both the library and a performing arts center, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to boosting its lease offer, the county promised to: 
</P>
<P>
* Spend $400,000 on books, educational materials and improvements over five 
years to three libraries serving Hacienda Heights and neighboring La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay $54,000 to maintain a swimming pool at Los Altos High School for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep the library open seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
* Work with the school district to electronically link the library's catalogue 
and the schools, so teachers and students can conduct research, search for 
titles and borrow books by computer. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is so exciting I can't stand it," said Sandy Johnson, a school 
board member who earlier this year had suggested that the library be built 
elsewhere, such as at another elementary school or at a nearby park. 
</P>
<P>
The current Hacienda Heights library, which may be converted to a senior 
citizens center if the county's deal with the district goes through, is on La 
Monde Street, about a mile from Dibble. Officials say the 10,000-square-foot 
building has outgrown the rapidly expanding community. County Librarian Sandra 
F. Reuben said 55,000 people use the library each year, compared to 38,000 
annually when the library first opened 18 years ago.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: CONSERVATISM HAS BUILT A WASTEFUL GARRISON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. GORDON, DAVID M. GORDON is professor of economics at the New School 
for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the human and economic costs of conservative economic policies during 
the 1980s have been widely noted: rising public and private debt, mounting 
trade deficits, epidemic homelessness and soaring inequality. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the most serious costs has largely gone unnoticed. Steadily and 
surely, the U.S. economy is building a garrison state. 
</P>
<P>
This should come as no surprise. By increasing economic inequality and 
insecurity, conservative economic policies have exacerbated social tensions. As 
a consequence, an ever-increasing fraction of the nation's productive potential 
must be devoted simply to keeping the have-nots at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, on the international scene, hawkish foreign and military policies 
aimed at reasserting U.S. global power have a comparably high price tag: A 
mounting fraction of the labor force is not producing goods for consumption or 
for investment but is either producing military goods or working for the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
This tendency toward a garrison state can be illustrated with some fairly 
simple numbers. In our forthcoming book, "After the Waste Land," Samuel Bowles, 
Thomas E. Weisskopf and I highlight this dimension of the costs of conservative 
economics by focusing on the proliferation of what we call "guard labor" and 
"threat labor." 
</P>
<P>
Guard labor enforces rules. In any society, many people do not produce goods 
and services directly, but rather enforce the rules that govern economic life. 
The presence of some guard labor is hardly an indictment of an economic system: 
It's a fact that rules are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But some rules are harder to enforce than others, and some economic structures 
must rely more heavily on guard labor. In the workplace, it takes large 
expenditures on surveillance and security personnel to enforce rules that 
workers often perceive as invasive, unfair, unnecessary and oppressive -- and 
far less when workers themselves are setting rules in a relatively democratic 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
By our count, the amount of guard labor in the U.S. economy is mammoth. We 
include three main groupings in our estimates: 
</P>
<P>
* Workplace supervisors, who must monitor and discipline workers to extract 
more intensive labor. 
</P>
<P>
* Domestic guards, including police, judicial and corrections employees as well 
as private security personnel, who protect against rule violations and deal 
with violators. 
</P>
<P>
* International guards, the armed forces and civilian defense employees as well 
as producers of military and domestic security equipment. 
</P>
<P>
By our estimates, guard labor constituted 22.5% of non-farm employment (plus 
the armed forces) in 1987. This comes to about 25 million in guard labor alone. 
</P>
<P>
Added to this burden is another category of unproductive labor in an 
unegalitarian society -- the wasted activities of what we call "threat labor." 
Employers in conflict-filled workplaces rely on the threat of job dismissal to 
help intimidate workers and extract greater labor intensity. The more 
hierarchical and conflict-filled the workplace, the more important the presence 
of this threat becomes. And the greater the reliance on this threat, the more 
important it becomes that unemployed workers are clamoring outside the 
workplace for jobs, making the threat of dismissal credible. 
</P>
<P>
We include three groups in our estimate of threat labor: 
</P>
<P>
* The unemployed, the front line of the threat battalions. 
</P>
<P>
* "Discouraged workers," those who want to work but have temporarily abandoned 
their search. 
</P>
<P>
* Prisoners, the rear guard battalions of the threat labor force, those members 
of the unemployed or irregularly employed who got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, threat labor made up 10.4% of non-farm employment (plus the armed 
forces), accounting for 11.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, more than 34 million Americans occupied roles as either guard 
or threat labor in 1987, accounting for almost a third of non-farm employment 
(plus the armed forces). 
</P>
<P>
What is more stunning is the rate of growth of the garrison state. To look at 
that growth, we compared 1987 to the previous business cycle peak to hold 
constant, for example, the effects of the expansion and contraction of the 
economy on unemployment. In 1979, guard and threat labor accounted for 26.7 
million in the U.S. labor force. We can see, therefore, that the burgeoning 
garrison state accounted for an increase of 7.6 million in total guard and 
threat labor during those eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives often boast of the U.S. "employment miracle" during the 1980s. 
Indeed, total non-farm employment (plus the armed forces) grew by 12.6 million 
between 1979 and 1987. But, as we have seen, the increase in guard and threat 
labor over that period amounted to 7.6 million, or three-fifths, of that total 
of 12.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Had those additional workers been put to work in productive employment in the 
investment-goods sector, U.S. net investment would have been more than double 
its actual levels in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The prophets of austerity insist that millions of ordinary households must 
tighten their belts, cutting back on consumption, to boost savings and 
investment and revive the U.S. economy. How about tightening the belt of the 
garrison state instead?

GINSENG IS A DAIRYLAND CASH COW; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: WISCONSIN FARMERS MILK IT FOR ALL IT'S WORTH. THEY'RE TRYING TO 
GET AMERICANS TO FALL FOR THE HERB USED IN CHINESE MEDICINE FOR GENERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SOON NEO LIM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year at this time, Wisconsin's Marathon County becomes a Chinatown, as 40 
to 50 Chinese merchants from Hong Kong, San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles 
converge on the quiet farming community to buy a prized herb the Chinese 
consider an aphrodisiac -- ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
Ginseng roots have been used for ages in Chinese medicine -- chewed raw or 
brewed into tea -- for illnesses and weaknesses. The Chinese believe that the 
bitter, man-shaped roots have a rejuvenating effect on the body. 
</P>
<P>
But it is ginseng's profit potential more than faith in its tonic powers that 
has spurred the growth of commercial production in Wisconsin. Processed roots 
wholesale for as much as $120 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Producers are also puzzling over how to entice Americans to consume more 
ginseng, nearly all of which is grown for sale abroad or in U.S. Chinatowns. 
</P>
<P>
In its wild form, ginseng is native to the cool woods of the Midwest and 
southern Canada and to the upper Appalachian mountain range. It is an 
endangered species and cannot be taken legally until the plant has reproduced 
itself. Exports of wild ginseng bring in $15 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cultivated variety is less prized, commercial production has shot 
up in Wisconsin, where the crop is worth $60 million to $70 million a year. 
There were fewer than 300 growers in the mid-1970s; today there are 1,700 
statewide. And with 1,600 growers, Marathon County has the world's largest 
concentration of cultivated ginseng. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Wisconsin growers produced 1.5 million pounds of the brown roots, 
about $50 million of which were exported to Hong Kong for both local 
consumption and re-export to other Asian countries. Chinatowns in the United 
States bought about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Demand has been very strong, but it's not a sure-fire way of earning money," 
said Jeff Schira, co-founder of the 400-member Wisconsin Ginseng Growers Assn. 
and the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"Many farmers have gone bankrupt," said Schira, a farmer for 17 years. "People 
don't realize the tremendous cost in planting and moving it. You can run into 
severe diseases and lose everything. Ginseng has to freeze over the winter 
time, (and) it needs a cover of snow but not a lot of rain. A couple of years 
ago I got hit by a tornado and lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, "there are many part-time farmers who see it as their hope in 
life to get ahead. If their gardens die, they still have their jobs in town." 
</P>
<P>
Schira, who has a salaried job as a buyer for a Hong Kong ginseng auction 
house, owns a 120-acre farm, with six acres planted in ginseng. Most of the 
other farms are smaller -- about three acres or less. 
</P>
<P>
Just to get an acre planted requires an investment of about $25,000, and the 
roots cannot be harvested for four to five years, when the plant -- green with 
red berries -- reaches a height of 1 1/2 feet. The yield can be anything from 
zero to 2,000 pounds per acre, "depending on luck," Schira said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after the Tian An Men square massacre in China -- the largest market 
for American ginseng -- the export price of unprocessed ginseng roots fell by 
one-quarter to the high $20s per pound but rebounded later to the $30s. The 
price fell when the Hong Kong merchants who buy U.S. ginseng for re-export to 
China cut back their purchases because of the political tumult. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, there are no negative developments in the export market, and 
prices are in the high $30s to low $40s a pound. 
</P>
<P>
But Wisconsin farmers fear that the growing popularity of their ginseng is 
being threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese ginseng has been flooding Hong Kong, eroding the market for American 
ginseng there and in U.S. Chinatowns, Schira said. He faulted the quality of 
the Chinese variety: "The root looks like ours. But ours is denser and has a 
much stronger smell." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. producers are also feeling competition from Canada, where ginseng 
production has exploded to about half a million pounds a year, the bulk of 
which is exported to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
To help the industry grow, the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin is trying to find new 
markets, both abroad -- including Taiwan, Singapore and Japan -- and at home. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron Rambadt, the board's executive director: "Somewhere down the road, we 
hope to sell to the American market -- that's the goal." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, by far the majority of ginseng users are Asians, who buy 
the root in Chinatown shops. Last year, Chinatown buyers were paying farmers 
from $40 to $120 a pound for processed U.S. ginseng, depending on the grade. 
Korean ginseng -- the most established variety -- wholesales for about the same 
price. Chinese ginseng is far cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Rambadt said producers hope to stimulate U.S. demand by generating scientific 
research that would back up their claims that ginseng helps lower cholesterol 
and reduce fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Some buyers need no such persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
"American ginseng is for energy; you can chew it anytime," said a 68-year-old 
Vietnamese Chinese woman living in Los Angeles who identified herself only as 
Mrs. Luu. She visited Chinatown recently to shop for her regular supply of 
ginseng, plus some for relatives in Vietnam. "I take Korean ginseng only in 
winter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To cater to American consumers, U.S. manufacturers have followed the lead of 
their Korean competitors by offering the root in such forms as capsules, tea 
and health drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Fmali Herb Co. of Santa Cruz has been using American ginseng in its capsules 
for 15 years. However, said sales manager Grace Marroquin: "American ginseng 
costs more, (so) we don't use it in products unless it's for a particular 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
R. J. Corr Naturals Inc., a Chicago-based maker of natural soft drinks, created 
a soda called "Ginseng Rush" in 1978. Chief executive Robert Corr, who believes 
that ginseng is a natural anti-stress remedy, said the company plans to come 
out with a nonalcoholic ginseng beer next January and maybe a ginseng elixir 
later. 
</P>
<P>
But will most Americans pay for ginseng? Said Los Angeles lawyer Carl 
Shusterman: "Depends on what it's going to do for my health. They 
(manufacturers) have to give me some product claims."

PERSONAL FINANCE: HOLDERS OF MATURING CDS FACE A DIFFICULT CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's decision time for many holders of certificates of deposit: October is one 
of the two biggest months for CDs to mature. But thanks in part to Saddam 
Hussein and Alan Greenspan, choosing where to put your money seems as tough as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
October is a big month for CDs to mature, largely because six-month and 
one-year CDs are the most popular maturities, and savers in recent years have 
tended to open up CDs in April or October. 
</P>
<P>
April has been popular because many people deposit their income-tax refunds. 
October is popular because CD rates were deregulated in October, 1983, 
resulting in higher rates that attracted many savers at the time. Also, many 
people pulled money out of stocks and put it into the relative safety of banks 
following the October, 1987, market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, some $130 billion worth of CDs are expected to mature this month. 
But the decision to roll over your CD into a new one is not a "no brainer." 
</P>
<P>
Guessing the direction of interest rates -- at least for the short term -- 
seems like a real crap shoot. Will Hussein's actions trigger war in the Middle 
East? If so, rates will shoot higher, and you'd want to say no dice to locking 
in a rate now with a CD. But what if peace persists and Federal Reserve chief 
Alan Greenspan loosens credit to drive down interest rates? Then you might want 
to lock in a rate on a CD or roll the dice by investing in long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, interest rates will go down," predicts Kurt Brouwer, 
president of Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San Francisco money management firm. 
"But there is definitely so much uncertainty that I don't think anybody knows 
where rates are going in the short run. You're better off playing with your 
kids than trying to figure out where interest rates are going." 
</P>
<P>
The decision also is tougher because of the sick shape of many banks and 
savings and loans. You might want to shop more carefully for stronger 
institutions because you could lose your nice rate if your institution fails. 
</P>
<P>
Also, with the economic recovery looking like it's on its death bed and a 
recession seemingly on the horizon, even your job may not be so safe. Do you 
want to lock your money up in a long-term CD if you might need that cash soon 
just to pay the mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips on the most common choices: 
</P>
<P>
* CDs and other bank deposits. If safety of principal is your main concern, 
these will do the trick. Despite all you've heard about the troubles of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank and thrift deposits, there 
is no way the government will let people lose money in accounts meeting the 
$100,000 insurance limit. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a risk: Your rate could be cut if your bank or thrift fails. 
That's because when the federal government transfers deposits from a failed 
institution to a healthy one, the healthy one is allowed to offer you a new, 
lower rate. You can, of course, just say no and take your money elsewhere. But 
if, in the meantime, prevailing CD rates have fallen, you would be stuck with a 
lower rate anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it pays to shop for strong institutions offering good rates. 
Fortunately, such opportunities are not hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
What if you want to lock in a high CD rate, yet also want the opportunity to 
withdraw your money in an emergency without incurring an early-withdrawal 
penalty? Consider brokered CDs sold through securities houses. You get the same 
federal deposit insurance as CDs bought from banks and S&amp;Ls, but you can 
sell brokered CDs through the securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, another way to maintain instant access to your money is through a 
bank or S&amp;L money market deposit account or passbook account. But their 
rates are generally inferior to most other choices, such as money-market mutual 
funds and government securities. 
</P>
<P>
* Government securities. Treasury bills can be ideal for conservative 
investors. They are safe -- backed by the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam -- 
and exempt from state and local income taxes (definitely an advantage in such 
high-tax states as California). Rates also compare favorably to CDs. 
Three-month bills are yielding about 7.3%; one-year bills are at about 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Want a higher yield with a bit more risk? Consider longer-maturity Treasury 
notes and bonds. Thirty-year bonds are yielding about 8.8%. 
</P>
<P>
But keep in mind that unless you hold notes and bonds to maturity, you could 
lose part of your principal should rates go up. The values of notes and bonds 
fall when rates rise. On the other hand, should rates fall, you could easily 
make total returns -- yield plus price appreciation -- well above 10%. 
</P>
<P>
* Money-market mutual funds. These may be the best balance between safety, 
decent yields and liquidity. The average money fund is yielding 7.76%, and you 
can easily withdraw your money by writing a check. 
</P>
<P>
Money funds are generally considered safe, but they are not as rock solid as 
CDs and Treasuries. Although no one has yet lost a penny of principal in a 
money market fund, they invest in commercial paper, a form of short-term IOU 
issued by big corporations. If the corporation issuing the paper defaults or 
has other financial troubles, the money fund will have to absorb that loss -- 
or pass it along to you. 
</P>
<P>
* Short-term bond funds. Go with these if you want a shot at double-digit 
yields in exchange for a bit more risk. They are paying slightly more than 
money market funds and have a chance at price appreciation should rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to stick to "no-load" funds, which don't charge sales commissions when 
you buy or sell. Those charges will wipe out part of your return. 
</P>
<P>
* Long-term bond funds. These are for gamblers who figure that interest rates 
will fall. If rates fall quickly and sharply -- such as by two or three 
percentage points in less than a year -- you could double your money. On the 
other hand, if rates rise, you'll lose some of your investment. 
</P>
<P>
* Tax-free bonds and funds. If you're in the 28% or 33% individual tax 
brackets, consider municipal bonds or mutual funds investing in them. Their 
yields generally are superior to the after-tax yields of many money market 
funds and CDs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the average yield on tax-exempt money funds is 5.89%, which is 
equivalent to taxable yields of 8.18% and 8.79% for investors in the 28% and 
33% brackets, respectively.

MONEY TALK: ONLY MAIN RESIDENCE GETS HOME-SALE TAX BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: May I sell two homes, both personal residences, to buy one of greater value 
than the two combined -- and defer paying taxes on gains I realize from the 
sales? -- E.J.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: No. You are allowed to defer paying taxes on gains you have from the sale of 
only your principal residence. And a person or married couple is deemed to have 
only one. 
</P>
<P>
However, others might be interested in knowing that two people may each sell 
their principal residences, pool their proceeds to purchase a single 
replacement residence and still qualify for the tax break. Taxes on their gains 
are deferred if the replacement home has a greater value than the combined 
value of the two houses being sold. In essence, the law treats the deal as the 
sale of a home and the purchase of a 50% interest in the replacement residence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Social Security at 62 Has Drawbacks 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife turned age 62 a few months ago. Because she didn't work much outside 
the home, she is not entitled to her own Social Security benefits. I will soon 
turn 62 but do not want to retire. I plan on continuing to work but am thinking 
of registering for Social Security anyway. I realize that I may not receive any 
benefits because my earnings will exceed the limits that Social Security 
allows. But may my wife begin collecting spousal benefits? What are the 
advantages and disadvantages of proceeding this way? -- T. I. 
</P>
<P>
A: Experts in the Social Security Administration recommend against your plan 
for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, your wife cannot receive spousal benefits unless you 
register to receive Social Security yourself. By doing this, you set your 
benefits at the rate of a 62-year-old beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
However, because you will be working and will have earnings above Social 
Security's limits, you will receive nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, your wife's benefits may be reduced as well because of your 
earnings. The Social Security Administration's test is applied to total 
household income, not just an individual's earnings. This year, if you are 
between 62 and 65, you may earn $6,840 before losing $1 in benefits for every 
$2 of earnings. A salary of $30,000 would be enough to preclude benefits for 
both the wage earner and spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Another consideration is that by filing for benefits at 62, the survivor's 
benefits that your wife could receive upon your death would also be lower than 
if you waited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
After 70, Contribution to IRA Will Be Taxable 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am still working and will be 70 years old on March 3, 1991. I expect to 
earn at least $2,000 next year. May I make a tax-deductible contribution of 
$2,000 to an IRA in 1991? Also, I have been withdrawing $2,400 per year from my 
IRAs. When I turn 70, must I recalculate that withdrawal based on my life 
expectancy and that of my wife? -- G.S.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: The answer to the first question is no. You may not make a tax-deferred 
contribution to an IRA in the year in which you turn age 70 1/2. The last year 
for which you may make such a contribution is 1990, the year in which you 
turned 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the second question is yes. Once you turn 70, your withdrawals 
must match those calculated according to your life expectancy and that of the 
beneficiary of your IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the first withdrawal under this formula must be made by April 1 of 
the year following that in which you turn 70. For you, that would be April 1, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When to Get Special Power of Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Q: When my husband retired, he put his pension fund into an individual 
retirement account that now contains a considerable sum. I am worried about 
what would happen if he became incompetent and was unable to tap the account. 
Is there something I can do to make sure that some of this money comes to me to 
handle his care? -- L.B.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: If your husband, or any IRA holder, becomes incompetent, account 
beneficiaries or family members certainly can obtain access to the funds. 
However, this mechanism must be set up before the illness or infirmity to 
assure a smooth transition.

Typically, when someone wants to hand over responsibility for his affairs to 
another person, he assigns a power of attorney to that person. However, a 
traditional power of attorney can remain in full force only with the continuing 
consent of the giver. So, if the giver becomes so incapacitated that he cannot 
give that consent, a normal power of attorney transfer can be nullified. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid problems of this nature for all assets, not just IRAs, our experts 
recommend that you sign what is known as a "durable power of attorney." This 
document will remain in effect even after the consent giver becomes 
incompetent, which would allow you to access your husband's account should you 
need assistance with any medical bills.

HOW TO PAY OFF HER LOAN IN 12 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am a never-married single female, 53 years old, and would like to 
retire at age 65 in the year 2002. My objective is to have the roof over my 
head paid for. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, I purchased a condominium for $44,900 with a 5% down payment. I signed 
a note financing $42,600 at 10.75% (fixed) for 30 years. The balance today is 
$39,000 and my payments are $402 a month and the mortgage will be paid off in 
July 2011. 
</P>
<P>
I live on a fixed income which, last year, was $29,000. I have other assets, 
put the maximum allowed by law into an IRA plus I save $100 a month in a 
regular savings account which has a balance of $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a few months I will receive about $7,000 to $8,000 from a retirement plan 
from my employer and plan to roll that over into an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
What advice can you give me regarding having the home paid for in 2002? Should 
I refinance to a 15-year term? Apply extra money to the principal and to the 
IRAs? Or apply an additional amount to the principal each month? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I wouldn't refinance if I were you and lock myself into higher payments 
that, at some time in the future, might be a little binding. Nor would I dabble 
with the IRA you are contributing into because of the tax-deferment aspect of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
According to my calculations it will take about another $93-a-month additional 
payment to your mortgage principal to pay your mortgage off in about 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, will eat up the $100-a-month that you're putting in your 
savings account, but since you have a balance there of about $8,000 for an 
emergency cushion it seems like the most practical diversion of funds open to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
What's "smart" about borrowing $60,000 for a home and over the next 30 years 
paying the lender $137,591 in interest alone (at 10.5%)? By painlessly 
accelerating the payoff of your mortgage you can save thousands in interest and 
cut many years off that awesome 30-year indebtedness.

TREAT HOME'S EXTERIOR TO MAKE IT STAND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Remodeling Ideas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A successful exterior house make-over starts with an honest assessment of what 
needs to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Remodeling Ideas magazine, most houses in need of help suffer from 
one of these problems: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Not enough detail: A home without interesting architectural details is 
rarely memorable. Details can be added with shutters, window boxes, trim, 
moldings or other new features. Use paint to accent present detailing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Too much detail: Some houses mix too many materials and styles. Take such 
houses back to basics. Strip away odd-ball elements. Paint mismatched material 
the same color or invest in unified cladding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Poor proportions: Use landscaping tricks or a new color scheme to shape up 
a house with awkward lines. Consider dormers, porches or a new entry to balance 
the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
As architectural details are added and subtracted, go for a look that's 
consistent with the basic lines, age and setting of the home. To help visualize 
the changes, try this: Enlarge a photo of the home's exterior, then put tracing 
paper over the top. Trace the house, then sketch in features that are being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Many exterior make-overs start with paint. To bring out the best in a home, use 
three colors: a basic field color for siding or brick; a trim color for borders 
around windows and doors and the soffit and fascia; and an accent color, for 
shutters, the front door, and any other small details. Keep in mind the roof 
color as the scheme is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas for color schemes can be picked up from homes that are admired or from 
groupings suggested by paint manufacturers. Some paint stores offer a video 
color selection service. Homeowners can look at a video image of a house styled 
like theirs and see how it looks painted in different combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Cladding a house with new materials may be the best choice if the old exterior 
is unattractive, mismatched or if an all-new look is wanted. Choices include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wood siding: Beveled wood siding, especially narrow clapboard, is still the 
look of tradition. For a contemporary look, use a top grade of cedar or redwood 
and stain it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Synthetic sidings: Vinyl or aluminum sidings mimic the look of wood, 
sometimes very well. Consider leaving special window or door trims exposed so 
character isn't sacrificed. Or, have trim custom-clad with aluminum that's 
molded to fit on-site. To add detail, ask about special trims for windows, 
doors and eaves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wood shakes and shingles: Shakes are rough-hewn for a more rustic look. 
Shingles are cut smoother; trim siding with fancy-cut shingles for a Victorian 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brick and stone veneers: These are premium products, and they denote 
long-lasting quality. They can be applied only on the front, or around the 
entire house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stucco: This mixture of cement, sand and water makes the look of many 
Southwestern, Tudor and contemporary homes. New stucco systems not only 
refinish a home but insulate it, too.

FLOWERS: CALOCHORTUS CAN BE GROWN FROM BULBS OR SEEDS, BUT THEY MUST BE 
PROTECTED FROM INSECTS. THEY PRODUCE MAGNIFICENT BLOOMS.

<P>
Attraction is what flowers are all about. Their brilliant colors and unusual 
markings are beacons for insects and other pollinators, but they wind up 
attracting human beings as well. In California's tawny hills such flirtations 
have developed into lifelong infatuations for many people, especially when the 
flowers involved are the ones called calochortus. 
</P>
<P>
In 1878, Carl Purdy, a 17-year-old Michigan native, was living with his family 
in Mendocino County. As he wandered the oak woods collecting wildflowers for 
his sister, who was recuperating from tuberculosis, he noticed some dainty 
yellow flowers that resembled glowing paper lanterns. He dug up some of the 
plants, which he found grew from bulbs, and mailed them to a New Jersey flower 
broker who dealt in California plants. 
</P>
<P>
The broker replied that the flower was a type of calochortus, a genus of the 
lily family related tulips, and that he would pay Purdy $1.50 for each 100 
bulbs he could send. From then until his death in 1945, Purdy made a career of 
exporting calochortuses and other California bulbs dug from the wild, in one 
year alone shipping half a million bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps 40 calochortus species are native to California, and they fall into 
three categories. Globe lilies or fairy lanterns have nodding, lantern-shaped 
flowers, while the type star tulips have erect, open flowers, their petals 
sometimes so thickly covered with hairs as to suggest another common name, 
cat's ears. 
</P>
<P>
But the most famous of the calochortus clan are the mariposa lilies, whose 
petals are often punctuated with spots, streaks and blotches of color 
resembling the markings on butterfly wings. 
</P>
<P>
All types of calochortus grow in summer-dry environments, a factor few of 
Purdy's customers understood. Because they were watered in summer or planted in 
summer-rainfall areas, most of the bulbs Purdy sold perished in a year or two. 
Fortunately, some of Purdy's customers persisted and became expert calochortus 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
In his last years, Purdy sold some bulbs to Fred Smith, at that time an El 
Monte traveling salesman. Smith potted the bulbs and was pleased when they 
bloomed the following spring. However, that summer he left them in his mother's 
care while he traveled, and she watered them to an early death. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was not about to give up, for he had been enamored of mariposa lilies 
since a 1938 high school hike in the Montebello hills. There he found 
Calochortus catalinae, a shapely, tulip-like flower that he recognized as a 
relative of the sego lilies of his native Wyoming. He was hooked, but his urge 
to grow calochortuses lay dormant for years until he saw Purdy's catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
After his initial failure, Smith started to grow calochortuses from seed, 
experimenting with various soil mixes, containers and watering schedules. Now 
retired and living in Glendale, Smith continues to be fascinated by the globe 
lilies, star tulips and mariposa lilies he grows in redwood boxes arrayed 
around his swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The new generation of calochortus fanciers is represented by Rob Ferber, a 
Caltech biology student whose introduction to the genus is strangely similar to 
that of his predecessors. Ferber's family moved from Pennsylvania to La Canada 
Flintridge in 1978, when he was 9-years-old. His first impression of California 
was, "It's a desert! It's dead!" 
</P>
<P>
He found little to like until, while visiting relatives in San Diego a few 
years later, he came across what he considered "a really pretty flower." It was 
Calochortus splendens, a lavender-flowered mariposa lily. When his attempts to 
grow them from seed failed due to summer watering, he began to study 
calochortus in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Ferber is now researching the molecular genetics of calochortus, trying to 
learn how the 60 or so species which range from British Columbia to Guatemala 
are related to each other and how they evolved. 
</P>
<P>
Besides unraveling this scientific mystery, Ferber is also making progress on 
how to grow calochortuses. Studying diseased bulbs, he observed that they had 
been gnawed by mites, allowing funguses to penetrate the bulb and rot them. So, 
in addition to keeping bulbs dry in their dormant period, Ferber recommends 
drenching them with the insecticide diazinon and the fungicide benlate during 
the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
Calochortus bulbs planted now will flower in the spring and, with adequate 
care, will bloom at least every other year thereafter. They should only be 
planted in strictly summer-dry parts of the garden or in containers, most 
growers favoring redwood boxes or clay pots. 
</P>
<P>
Ferber's soil mix consists of equal parts of plaster sand, perlite and pine 
needle compost, while Smith's formula calls for 40% loamy topsoil, 30% sand and 
30% redwood sawdust. Redwood and pine needles are valuable because they contain 
natural fungicides. 
</P>
<P>
The bulbs do best if consistently moist, but not soggy, during their growing 
period, and can be fed monthly with half-strength liquid fertilizer. Mariposa 
lilies and star tulips fare best in full sun, but fairy lanterns prefer light 
shade. 
</P>
<P>
By the time bulbs flower in the spring, their leaves have started to turn 
yellow, indicating that it's time to stop watering until cool weather returns 
in the fall. It helps to cover the containers with a lid to make sure they are 
not watered and to set them out of the hot sun. 
</P>
<P>
Calochortus seeds and nursery-grown bulbs are available from C.H. Baccus, 900 
Boynton Ave., San Jose, Calif. 95117; Theodore Payne Foundation, 10459 Tuxford

REPAIRING A 'GUILLOTINE WINDOW'; 
</P>
<P>
REPAIRS: WHEN A DOUBLE-HUNG WINDOW CRASHES DOWN, IT CAN CAUSE INJURIES. USUALLY 
THE CAUSE IS A DEFECTIVE SASH BALANCE. HERE'S HOW TO FIX IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and a free-lance 
writer.

<P>
Do you have "guillotine windows," double-hung wood-frame windows that come 
crashing down every time you open them? Do you have windows in the house that 
cannot be opened fully because they snag on a thin cable that hangs loose at 
the side of the frame? 
</P>
<P>
Both problems are caused by a broken cable or spring from the sash balances, 
the mechanisms that balance the weight of the window sashes to keep them from 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are broken sash balances a constant source of annoyance, they are also 
a considerable safety hazard. Emergency room statistics indicate that many 
broken hands and fingers (especially childrens') result from wood windows 
falling due to broken balances. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that in most cases, window sash balances can be replaced by a 
novice in less than an hour once you have the proper part. 
</P>
<P>
To get started, you have to determine the correct weight sash balance to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by taking the window measurements. Imagine both upper and lower sash were 
taken out of the frame, leaving a rectangular opening in the wall. What would 
the dimensions of the rectangle be? 
</P>
<P>
Then, determine whether the window requires one balance or two. With the lower 
sash fully closed, look into the window track just above the top of the sash. 
</P>
<P>
You will see a thin metal plate on either the left or the right indicating a 
one-balance window, or you will see a thin plate in both the left and right 
tracks, indicating a two-balance window. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the dimensions of the window and knowledge of whether one or two sash 
balances are required, you can go to most any hardware store and obtain the 
proper weight replacement sash balance. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement of the sash balance requires removing the sashes from the 
window frame. 
</P>
<P>
With a hammer and chisel, remove either the left or right "stop," the long thin 
molding against which the lower sash slides up and down. Begin at the top or 
bottom and tap the chisel blade into the joint between the stop and the window 
jamb. 
</P>
<P>
As the stop begins to separate from the jamb, carefully pull it away farther 
using the chisel blade as a pry bar. Pry the stop at several spots along its 
length to prevent its breaking. Once free, set the stop aside and remove any 
remaining nails. 
</P>
<P>
With the stop removed, the lower sash can be lifted slightly and swung out of 
the frame. If it is still connected by the cable at the bottom, use the chisel 
blade to pry the cable bracket nail from the lower edge. Grab the cable bracket 
and allow it to retract slowly into the sash balance now exposed midway up the 
window track. 
</P>
<P>
Set the lower window sash aside and begin removing the upper sash. Note the 
rounded molding that runs the length of the window jamb adjacent to the upper 
sash. This is the "parting bead" and also should be removed using a hammer and 
chisel in a similar way in which the stop was taken off. 
</P>
<P>
With the parting bead set aside, the upper sash is free. Swing it out of the 
frame and detach the sash balance cable if it still connected under the lower 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Now that both upper and lower sashes have been removed from the frame, the sash 
balance itself is easily replaced. Simply pry it out of the window jamb with 
the claws of a hammer and discard it. 
</P>
<P>
With a pair of pliers grab the cable brackets that lay on the inside portion of 
the new balance and swing them around so they will be on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Insert the sash balance into the window jamb opening and secure it in place 
with the nails provided. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the kay to the success of this repair, reassembling the window. 
</P>
<P>
Reinstall the upper sash first. Put the non-cable bracket edge of the sash into 
the track and swing the other edge toward the frame. Grasp the cable bracket 
exposed on the outside of the sash balance with a pair of pliers and pull it 
down far enough to clear the bottom of the sash. 
</P>
<P>
Continue swinging the sash as far as possible into the frame. Allow the cable 
bracket to retract until it contacts the bottom edge of the sash. Orient the 
bracket on the wood according to the outline left by the old bracket and secure 
it in place with one of the nails provided. 
</P>
<P>
Test the upper sash for free movement, and if it is OK, replace the parting 
bead into its groove and secure it with two or three 1 1/2-inch finishing nails 
driven directly through the top of it. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat this procedure for the lower sash. Attach the cable bracket under the 
sash, swing the sash into place, and test it for free movement. 
</P>
<P>
Before reattaching the stop, place it next to the lower sash and secure it with 
four or five evenly spaced 1 1/2-inch finishing nails driven about half way in. 
</P>
<P>
Retest the operation of the lower sash to assure that it is smooth. Remove and 
adjust the nails if necessary. Once you are satisfied that it operates 
properly, drive the nails in fully. Touch up any chipped paint on the casing or 
stop. Lubricate the window tracks with a thin coat of Vaseline if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
That's it. No longer will you test your frustration level and risk broken bones 
when you want some fresh air.

BUILDING A RETAINING WALL WITH RAILROAD TIES; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: TIES ARE EASIER TO HANDLE FOR THE DO-IT-YOURSELFER THAN MANY 
OTHER MATERIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the ways to build a retaining wall, working with landscaping timbers or 
railroad ties is certainly the easiest. It requires nowhere near the skill nor 
the actual physical effort involved in working with alternatives such as stone, 
concrete block or brick. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the job has to be done correctly or you'll discover that in a few 
years the wall may begin to rot, shift, bulge or actually topple under the 
pressure of the soil behind it. This is especially true in areas with lots of 
rainfall and a freezing climate. 
</P>
<P>
The technique described here work well for walls up to about three feet high. 
Beyond this height, it's not a bad idea to have the wall designed by an 
engineer, or to have it built by a pro. 
</P>
<P>
The ties. Landscaping timbers come in a variety of sizes, but the best for 
walls are 5-x-5, 5-x-6 and 6-x-6. The 5-x-6 size is a good compromise. Laid on 
edge, it builds as fast as the 6-x-6 but costs less. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever size you choose, make sure it is pressure-treated with CCA. This 
treatment gives much greater rot protection than you'll ever get in any other 
way. And CCA-treated wood will not harm nearby landscaping as wood treated with 
some other preservatives might. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting. The best way to cut timbers is with a chain saw. If you don't have 
one, you can rent. It pays to get one bigger than you think you'll need, and to 
make sure it is sharp. Dull, underpowered saws tend to bog down, wander and 
produce sloppy cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Lay out your line of cut on the top, the face and the rear edge of the timber 
with a clear, dark line (I use a black felt marking pen). Then make your cut 
facing the rear of the timber. This will put any chipping and splintering of 
the back of the wall out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation. You should start your wall on a firm base of packed soil or gravel, 
one full tie below ground level. This means you'll have to dig a trench. If 
your soil is firm and drains well, dig about six inches, level and tamp firmly. 
If drainage or soft soil is a problem, dig down a foot, fill six inches with 
pea gravel and tamp down firmly. Make sure this base is firm and level. 
</P>
<P>
Lay out your first course of ties, make sure they are firmly bedded and level, 
and then pin them to the ground for extra stability. The easiest way to do this 
is with three-inch lengths of concrete reinforcing bar (rebar), sold at masonry 
supply houses. Prebore for these with a half-inch bit, about 20 inches from the 
ends of each tie, and then drive them in place with a sledge. Recheck for level 
and adjust as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Now you can start building in earnest. This is pretty much like playing with 
big, long blocks. Stagger all joints at least two feet, and overlap corners as 
shown in the sketch. Fasten each course to the one below it with 3/8-by-12-inch 
spikes. Space these six inches from the ends of each tie, and 24 inches apart 
along the length of each tie. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever one tie overlaps a joint in the course below it, drive a pair of 
spikes down through the top tie into the two below, about 10 inches back from 
the joint. To prevent splitting, it's a good idea to predrill with a 
quarter-inch bit, especially for spikes near the ends of timbers. This also 
makes it easier to drive the spikes home, and helps prevent them from wandering 
off course. 
</P>
<P>
Deadmen. To help prevent the wall from bowing or tipping under the pressure of 
the earth behind it, you need some kind of anchoring device. If you can find 
earth anchors (long steel shafts with augers at the end) they are a good 
choice. You can just twist these two into the soil like a giant drill, and then 
fasten them to the ties with a pair of spikes driven into the eye at the other 
end. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is to build a deadman like the one in the sketch. Make this like 
a "T" with a 40-inch stem and a 24-inch top. Spike it together and spike it to 
the wall, and bury it with firmly packed soil. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever anchor you use, you'll need one for every eight feet of wall. Center 
it left to right and place it one course down from the top of the wall. Your 
wall also needs to be anchored at the ends. Normally you'll do this by means of 
an intersecting wall as shown in the sketch. But if the retaining wall butts up 
against your foundation (as a driveway retaining wall often does), you can 
anchor that end of the wall with another deadman. In this case, tip the "T" on 
edge so the top runs vertically instead of horizontally. 
</P>
<P>
Fill. If drainage may be a problem, it's best to fill the area just behind the 
wall with a band of gravel about a foot wide. You can also run perforated 
plastic pipe along the bottom of the gravel fill, leading it out to the ends of 
the wall. Then continue filling behind the wall, placing and packing the soil 
in layers to avoid future settling. It pays to fill right up to the top of the 
wall so any heavy rains can simply run right over the wall.

GWEN, 60, HAS SEEN MORE of her older sister Bette, 63, since moving to 
California several years ago than she did when they both lived in the same 
state. "I think it's because absence makes the heart grow fonder," Gwen says. 
"Bette got married when I was 18 and we never spent much time together until I 
moved out here. She's been here twice to visit, and we spend two or three weeks 
together -- which is about the most time we've spent together in 40 years. We 
talk a lot about our mom and dad and about old times. She remembers a lot more 
than I do. She talks about what a brat I was when I was a teen-ager -- she 
remembers a lot of things I don't, but when I hear them, I know they're true." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwen and Bette are the rule, not the exception. When we're old, even more so 
than when we're young, our brothers and sisters are likely to be among our best 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have found that the proportion of people who say they feel close 
to their siblings rises with age. From their 30s on, most sisters and brothers 
not only see each other more often but also say they feel closer to each other 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
From the story of Cain and Abel to the tale of "Hannah and Her Sisters," the 
power of the complex bond between brothers and sisters is hard to deny. Yet 
until about 15 years ago, psychologists tended to relegate relationships with 
siblings to a poor fourth place, after ties to children, parents and mates. 
</P>
<P>
Says Carol Holden, a University of Michigan psychologist: "Relationships among 
sisters and brothers were thought to be either pale reflections of their 
relationships with parents or defined almost entirely by sibling rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
Now, an increasing number of psychologists believe that relationships with 
siblings can be among the most important in life. And a growing body of 
research suggests that sibling ties become more, not less, important as we age. 
These relationships form the clearest blueprints we have for later relations 
with peers. Says Holden: "The way you got along with your sisters and brothers 
when you were young can influence your choice of friends and marriage partners. 
It can also have a strong influence on how you get along with co-workers." 
</P>
<P>
In "My One and Only: The Special Experience of The Only Child," (William Morrow 
and Co., 1989), San Francisco author Ellie McGrath describes her own childhood 
and weighs the advantages and disadvantages of being an only child. "Most only 
children, myself included, believe that had they grown up with a sibling, they 
would have learned how to deal with others sooner and more smoothly. They feel 
that they are a bit slow sensing the dynamics of peer relationships or learning 
the art of negotiation." Not to mention learning how to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason our relationships with siblings are among life's most important 
is their sheer longevity. As marriages crumble and friendships fade, "the 
sibling relationship becomes for many people the only intimate connection that 
seems to last," observes University of Hartford psychologist Michael Kahn, 
co-editor with family therapist Karen Lewis of "Siblings in Therapy." The 
sibling relationship is the only one that has the potential to last from the 
cradle to the grave. In fact, Kahn notes, a brother or sister is the most 
likely of all relatives to be at your side when you die. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hollywood has recognized how important brothers and sisters can be to each 
other. Besides "Hannah and Her Sisters," Kahn cites "Crimes of the Heart," 
"Fanny and Alexander," "Ran" and "The Color Purple" as examples of recent films 
in which sibling relationships eclipse romantic ties. Add to this list the 
critically acclaimed "sex, lies and videotape" and the Australian sleeper, 
"Sweetie," in which two sisters compete for their inattentive parents' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Given the importance of the sibling relationship, it's not surprising that for 
some people the major psychological "work" of middle age consists of settling 
old scores with siblings, according to Wesleyan University psychologist Stephen 
Bank, co-author with Kahn of "The Sibling Bond." The first thing to understand, 
he notes, is that it's not normal to feel distant from or angry toward a sister 
or brother. "Most adults have cordial, mutually supportive relationships with 
their brothers and sisters," says Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Those who do not, Bank believes, can at least learn to stop seeing their 
siblings as the cause of the problem and, through therapy, begin to understand 
that both they and their siblings are victims of the same twisted family 
dynamics that may have been in operation for generations. In other words, in 
middle age, estranged siblings may finally begin to fathom the depths of their 
family tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychotherapists are the audiences for modern sibling legends," Bank says. "We 
don't hear sagas of heroic nomads from great tribal families -- like Jacob and 
Esau. But we do hear about disconnected modern brothers and sisters, living 
miles apart in distant suburbs, who've become alienated and angry" at one 
another. When siblings are at war, sometimes it's a fight to the death, and 
some people never achieve that closeness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried for years to get along with her," says Hazel, 65, explaining why she 
wouldn't call or visit an older sister who'd just had a major heart attack. The 
sister had stopped talking to Hazel and other family members many years before. 
"I bear no malice against her anymore, but I can't put up with her bitterness, 
the way she still blames Mamma and Poppa for everything bad that happened to 
her. I love her and I hope she doesn't suffer a lot. She's my sister, but I 
just cannot put up with her." As a teen-ager, another sister, the youngest in 
this same large family, moved as far away from the others as she could and for 
most of her life didn't call or visit anyone in her family of origin. A brother 
disappeared, cutting off all contact with his children, nieces, nephews and 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Such "disowned sibling relationships" -- in which adult sisters and brothers 
stop speaking or wind up exploding at each other when they do get together -- 
are often the fallout of parental uninvolvement, neglect or abuse, according to 
Bank. But by far the most common cause is pathological favoritism. The case of 
Rebecca, a professional woman in her early 50s whose husband was threatening to 
leave her because she was frigid, is one of many Bank has seen in which the 
effects of favoritism are felt long after the parents are dead. Rebecca's 
parents always celebrated her younger sister's talents and achievements. They 
praised the younger sister's looks as well as her brains, and believing their 
praise, the sister projected a self-confidence that made her a magnet for men. 
Feeling hopelessly outclassed, Rebecca gave up trying to imitate her sister. 
"Because she felt so inferior and believed she wasn't attractive at all 
compared with her sister," Bank says, "she rejected her own sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
Although the reasons parents favor one child over another vary from family to 
family, the underlying dynamics behind pathological favoritism are similar, 
Bank maintains. "All parents like one thing about one child and another thing 
about another child," he says. "The question is, at what point do they start 
comparing them and does it all get out of hand? In a normal family, everybody 
gets to be the scapegoat and everybody gets to be the favorite. You take turns. 
One child is catching heat one day and being treated well another day. It 
rotates. In troubled families, one child remains the scapegoat and one remains 
the favorite, which leads to all sorts of things, including lifelong sibling 
discord." 
</P>
<P>
Even in normal families, though, myths often develop about the personalities 
and talents of siblings that may have little to do with reality. These myths 
have a way of persisting into adulthood, influencing how grown-up sisters and 
brothers feel about themselves and each other. 
</P>
<P>
A classic study by pediatrician Frances Fuchs Schachter confirmed the existence 
of the "Cain and Abel syndrome," the tendency of parents to believe that their 
first two children are "as different as night and day." Schachter asked 140 
mothers to compare their children, two at a time, on a series of personality 
attributes. She found that 80% of the mothers thought their children had 
opposite characteristics. If one was viewed as an introvert, the other was seen 
as an extrovert. If one was seen as fast, smart or strong, the other was likely 
to be viewed as slow, stupid or weak. Often, siblings themselves act out these 
differences, so that if parents make a big deal out of one being "good," the 
other starts acting "bad." 
</P>
<P>
Schachter also found that college students said they were different from their 
siblings about twice as often as they reported being alike, suggesting that 
they have internalized their parents' opinions. While most brothers and sisters 
manage to find their own identities, sometimes their "de-identification" with 
each other becomes even more pronounced with age. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the time, though, the differences between sisters and brothers are far 
less dramatic. "I'm an older sister with a younger sister," says Carol Holden, 
the Michigan psychologist who has studied the experience of being an older 
versus a younger sibling. "There's two and a half years and nine days between 
us. But who's counting? My sister and I have gotten along quite well over the 
years, but a lot of the popular misconceptions have been applied to us, like 
the older one is the smart one, the younger one is the pretty one." 
</P>
<P>
In her study of 60 college students, Holden found other, more realistic 
differences between what it feels like to be the older versus the younger 
sibling in a family of two children -- still the most common number, according 
to the U.S. Census Bureau. Older children are much more likely to express guilt 
about how they treated their siblings during childhood. "Older siblings 
remember a lot of very conscious wishes to harm their younger siblings," Holden 
says. "They have a lot of memories of pushing their sister or brother down or 
hitting them over the head." 
</P>
<P>
Although most siblings Holden interviewed said they were very happy with how 
they were now getting along with their brothers and sisters, there was one 
notable exception. The older sisters of younger brothers were much more likely 
than others to be unhappy with their relationship. "Having a younger brother is 
a lot more disruptive than having a younger sister," explains Holden. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does the second child destroy the first-born's privileged position as 
the sole recipient of parental time, love and attention, but if the second 
child is a boy, the first-born girl can't help but notice that he's talked to 
and handled differently by both parents. "In a culture where boys are highly 
valued, it's a double displacement," she says. "If you believe any of Freud's 
concepts of penis envy, it fits right in with this because when their brothers 
were born, the girls (in the study) tended to be right at the age (2) when sex 
differences are first noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"This sample is small, so I hate to make generalizations," Holden says, "But 
when I think about having children, if I have one of each, I'm hoping the boy 
comes first." 
</P>
<P>
As sisters and brothers graduate from college and start careers of their own, 
they often drift apart, communicating indirectly through their parents, getting 
together for holidays once or twice a year. When they marry and have children 
of their own, though, their need for contact with each other often increases. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn, 42, and her sister Diane, 38, talk to each other on the telephone 
almost every day and visit whenever they can. While they were in college, 
months went by without either of them making contact. "We didn't get along when 
we were growing up," Marilyn says. "And when we went off to college, we were 
both glad to put a little space between us." But after they gave birth to 
daughters within a year of each other, they became closer than ever, as many 
sisters do. 
</P>
<P>
As aging parents need more help, middle-aged brothers and sisters may find old 
patterns reactivated. The decision to assume the major responsibility for an 
ailing mother or father may reflect the wish to outgrow a childhood role. 
</P>
<P>
At 40, Margaret was the youngest of three sisters, the mid-life baby. "Nothing 
was expected of me," she recalls. "I roamed the meadows. I wrote poetry. When I 
asked what I should bring for Thanksgiving, the answer was usually 'rolls and 
pickles.' " When her 80-year-old mother developed Alzheimer's-related dementia 
and could no longer live alone safely, Margaret was the one who quit her job, 
uprooted her family and moved to a different town to take care of her ailing 
mother, even though her two older sisters lived in the same town as their 
mother. "I think the real reason I did it was I thought, 'Geez, here's my 
chance to prove that I'm finally responsible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other women taking care of ailing parents report feeling angry about the lack 
of support brothers and sisters provide. "My sister has only visited once in 
the last year, and then she had the nerve to criticize what I was doing for 
mother," says one woman. "My brother didn't help at all," says another, who 
took care of a mother with Alzheimer's Disease for several years. "I can't 
forgive him for it." "My sister's furious that I'm using part of our mother's 
money to hire a part-time helper," says yet another woman whose elderly, 
incontinent mother lives with her. "She doesn't seem to understand I need a 
break. We haven't spoken for more than a year now." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Silverstone, author of "You and Your Aging Parent," believes that 
while siblings sometimes turn their backs and leave one sister holding the bag, 
life isn't often that simple. "Usually there's something going on between the 
sisters and brothers that needs to be explored," she says. The sibling taking 
daily care of an aged parent may push her brothers and sisters away, fearing 
she'll be criticized for not taking good enough care of the ailing parent or 
wishing to become -- at long last -- the most important person in her parent's 
life. Or, the caretaker may be haunted by the suspicion that, despite all her 
sacrifices, her parent still prefers a brother or sister. 
</P>
<P>
Although settling scores with sisters and brothers may be important in 
middle-age, add a few more years and most siblings start to mellow. The death 
of a parent can bring sisters and brothers closer to each other. "After an 
elderly parent dies, some families become more distant," says Andrew Scharlach, 
a University of Southern California researcher who is studying the impact on 
adults of parents' deaths. "But others become closer. One sister or brother 
begins to act in loco parentis, becoming the new head of the family or the kin 
keeper." 
</P>
<P>
According to Purdue University psychologist Victor Cicerelli, the life cycle 
that begins with two or more siblings being each other's closest companions and 
best friends often ends the same way. Cicerelli interviewed more than 300 
brothers and sisters and found a low level of rivalry among elderly sibs: 10% 
reported having arguments; 6% reported being bossed or attempts at domination 
by a sib; 8% reported feelings of competition -- and that only rarely -- and 
only a handful reported outbreaks of jealously, hostility, or snobbishness. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of bickering or feuding, Cicerelli found that older sisters and 
brothers spent a good deal of time reminiscing -- a way of bringing back what 
they had together and of exorcising any remnants of sibling rivalry. "Sisters 
seem to have the closest relationships," Cicerelli reports. "At least they 
report lower morale and more depression if they're not getting along with their 
siblings." 
</P>
<P>
In middle-age, almost 70% of the people Cicerelli interviewed said they felt 
close or extremely close to a sister or brother. In old age, more than 80% did. 
Even those who did not seemed to recognize how valuable the relationship is. 
</P>
<P>
As one man told Cicerelli: "Sure, I hate my brothers. But after all, they're 
family."

PLASTIC SURGERY IS NO LONGER THE PREROGATIVE OF ASPIRING ACTRESSES OR AGING 
DOWAGERS. IN 1989, THERE WERE AT LEAST 2 MILLION SUCH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED 
STATES. THIS YEAR, ABOUT ONE IN 100 AMERICANS WILL UNDERGO TREATMENT. TODAY'S 
TYPICAL PATIENT IS, ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, A 
PRODUCT OF "MAINSTREAM U.S.A."

medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past decade and a half, Dr. William Wei-Lin Shaw has performed some of 
the most miraculous operations imaginable. He has sculpted new body parts -- 
feet and hands and mouths -- from ones grotesquely malformed at birth. He has 
reformed faces -- jaws and noses and chins -- eaten away by cancer. He has 
reconstructed appendages -- legs and scalps and genitals -- severed by machines 
or crushed in automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 15 years Shaw also has done tummy tucks and face lifts and nose 
jobs. He has made small breasts large and beefy thighs slim. He has pinned 
protruding ears and lifted sagging buttocks. Eyelids, cheeks, necks, ankles -- 
virtually every part of the anatomy that is subject to the toss of genetic dice 
or the ravages of time is a candidate for his expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw is a plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Like many in his speciality, the 48-year-old chief of plastic and 
reconstructive surgery at UCLA has undertaken a variety of surgical cases, some 
of which are considered beyond hope, others that are debatably outside the 
bounds of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic surgery is a field of medicine that has grown phenomenally over the 
past two decades. In the past 10 years, the number of procedures has doubled. 
Last year alone, there were at least 2 million plastic surgery operations in 
the United States. This year about one in 100 Americans will undergo plastic 
surgery, although estimates vary since plastic surgeons are not required to 
report the number or kind of procedures they do. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, most operations, more than 60%, have been classified as 
"reconstructive" -- that is, they involve functional rehabilitation of parts of 
the body maimed by accident, disease or birth defect. Because they are 
considered medically necessary, reconstructive plastic surgeries are covered in 
large part by health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The rest (and by far the fastest-growing area of plastic surgery) are 
operations that are considered "cosmetic" -- that is, purely aesthetic 
procedures designed to perfect the look of the body. Although prices range from 
a few hundred dollars for nonsurgical treatments, such as collagen injections 
to smooth wrinkles, to more than $10,000 for face lifts and hair transplants, 
patients must pay most, if not all, costs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetic surgery is no longer the prerogative of actresses or aging dowagers. 
Today's typical patient is, according to the California Society of Plastic 
Surgeons, a product of "Mainstream U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Chicago-based American Society of Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgery found that fewer than one quarter of all cosmetic 
surgery patients had household incomes of more than $50,000 a year. About a 
third were in the $25,000 to $50,000 bracket, and another third had household 
incomes of $25,000 or less. (Nearly 10% did not state their income.) 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Los Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world, a patient for 
cosmetic surgery is as likely to be a schoolteacher as she is to be a starlet," 
says Dr. Henry J. Kawamoto, president of the California Society of Plastic 
Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
And the she may be also a he. Although men represented about 5% of plastic 
surgery patients in the early 1980s, they now make up 20% to 25% of such 
patients, according to a number of estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of cosmetic surgery is said to be a by-product of two 
sociological phenomena: divorce and dieting. While dieting can result in 
sagging skin, divorce demands that people, sometimes late in life, start 
looking and feeling their best. And what better way to build confidence than 
with a new head of hair or a new set of breasts? 
</P>
<P>
Women, especially feminists, it would seem, might have compunctions about 
subjecting themselves to the pain and risk of plastic surgery for purely 
cosmetic reasons. Not so, insisted Ms. Magazine. Women may have burned their 
bras in the 1960s, but in the 1980s they have come to prefer bigger bras to no 
bras. Cher, who may have has succumbed to the surgeon's knife as often as any 
modern entertainer, is, according to Ms. editors, an exemplary 1980s feminist. 
She has used cosmetic surgery as a way to "reinvent herself." Plastic surgery 
is for "real women" who "dare to take control of their lives," the editors said 
in the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody is so enamored of plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"It (getting plastic surgery) has to do with a feeling of entitlement -- with 
believing you are entitled to have a perfect body," explains one Los Angeles 
psychiatrist, many of whose patients have considered cosmetic surgery. "As far 
as I'm concerned I am entitled to a perfect body only after I have a perfect 
personality. As soon as I'm always nice, always patient, always insightful, 
then maybe it's time to start thinking about letting someone work on my behind 
and belly with a knife." 
</P>
<P>
Like many plastic surgeons who are highly trained and whose skills are much in 
demand, UCLA's Shaw has little time for jokes or philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The question of who needs help the most, who is most deserving of treatment -- 
those are distinctions that Shaw, as a surgeon, is unwilling to make. To be 
sure, he says, there are cases at the ends of the spectrum: A child with a 
congenital cranial deformity that makes him look positively monstrous is surely 
more in need of a plastic surgery than a perfectly gorgeous actress who wears a 
size C bra but would prefer a size D. But what of the child with a severe 
birthmark versus a woman with abnormally small breasts or a man with abnormally 
large ones? Is one more worthy of a surgeon's attention than another? Does one 
have more severe psychological problems than the other? How is a doctor to 
choose? 
</P>
<P>
The role of a plastic surgeon is to be an architect and artist as well as a 
physician and surgeon, Shaw says. He is as pleased to help a patient enjoy the 
finer things in life as he is to help another regain some semblance of 
normality. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's job, as he sees it, is not to save lives but to improve the quality of 
life. That means reconstructing body parts both so they function better and 
look more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened to plastic surgery over the past century and in particular 
during the past 20 years is the story of what is happening to all medicine," 
Shaw says. "Where doctors once worked solely on major epidemics and other 
matters of life and death and pain, they can now focus on how to improve lives. 
Some of the life-and-death questions, of course, remain. But the focus in 
medicine has clearly shifted. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, the emphasis is on improving form and function, which is what 
plastic surgery has always done. It is simply a field (that has been) ahead of 
its time." Time was when cancer victims had to live with having their bodies 
mutilated by surgery. Survivors of accidents often had no choice but to have 
one or more limbs amputated. Thanks to plastic surgery, working in tandem with 
orthopedics, neurology and other specialties, that is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
For years, before coming to UCLA, Shaw had been director of microsurgery at New 
York University and chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Manhattan's 
Bellevue Hospital, an inner-city medical center renowned for salvaging 
traumatized limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a field that has long been considered progressive, Shaw was viewed as 
something of a maverick because of the lengths to which he went to perfect both 
the art and science of his work. The result in New York was an impressive track 
record and a spectacular list of "miracle" surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
In an eight-hour-long operation in 1979, Shaw and a team of five doctors and as 
many nurses made headlines for successfully reattaching the leg of a New Jersey 
policeman who had been crushed between two cars. In another multi-hour 
operation that year, also involving a large operating team and sophisticated 
reconstruction techniques, Shaw reconnected the severed hand of an aspiring 
young musician who had been pushed in front of a subway train. In 1985, in an 
operation involving eight doctors, all of whom were simultaneously working on 
two other trauma victims, Shaw and his colleagues again made headlines, this 
time for reconstructing the legs of a Manhattan woman who had been pinned for 
six hours beneath a fallen construction crane. 
</P>
<P>
Within months after coming to Los Angeles, as chief of UCLA's plastic and 
reconstructive surgery department, Shaw had overseen equally difficult and 
extraordinary cases. In 1989, for example, UCLA surgeons reattached the scalp 
of a young Los Angeles factory worker whose entire head of hair, from the top 
of his forehead to the nape of his neck, had become entangled in a machine and 
had been ripped off his head. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, members of the UCLA plastic surgery team operated on another male, a 
psychiatric patient who had amputated his own penis with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
The policeman whose leg was severed is now retired from the force but has a 
working leg. The woman whose legs were crushed spends her summers walking five 
miles a day on the beach. The musician whose hand was severed -- though not 
able to play the flute at the concert level -- is an occupational therapist, 
helping others recover from similar traumas. The factory worker is back at work 
with a full head of hair. 
</P>
<P>
Only the fate of the young mental-health patient is in question. Even he has 
made tremendous progress. Already he is urinating normally and his doctors have 
reason to hope that one day he may even have normal sexual function. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years, even 10 years ago, these operations would have been 
unthinkable," says Dr. Jay Orringer, who directed the surgery. "Today they have 
become almost routine." 
</P>
<P>
The routine, however, is far from simple. Although many cosmetic procedures are 
done in outpatient clinics or in private physicians' offices and take anywhere 
from two to six hours, complex reconstructions are invariably done in 
sophisticated medical centers and can take the better part of a day or night. 
</P>
<P>
By almost any standard, the surgical teams are enormous in size, often 
including numerous plastic surgeons, several anesthesiologists, half a dozen 
nurses and, depending on the procedure, a neurologist, an orthopedist, a 
urologist or any number of other specialists. Often, psychologists and 
psychiatrists are called upon to counsel the patient after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The procedures themselves are painstaking, highly complex ordeals. Plastic 
surgeons have learned that they cannot simply reattach severed parts or 
casually cut out excess body tissue. Bones must be carefully set together if 
the body is to be properly reshaped; nerves must be painstakingly reattached if 
sensation is to be maintained; blood vessels must be reconnected if tissue is 
to remain alive. 
</P>
<P>
Because the tissues involved are often so small and so delicate -- nerves are 
the size of thin spaghetti, and blood vessels can be even finer -- plastic 
surgeons frequently must work under a microscope with needles barely visible to 
the naked eye and thread too fine to be seen except when it catches the light. 
</P>
<P>
Microsurgery -- the technology that helped to save the young man's penis, the 
musician's hand and the factory worker's scalp -- has been in use for the past 
20 years, but recent advances have broadened the speciality. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic application has been in Shaw's area of speciality -- 
what is known as "microvascular free-flap surgery." Essentially, this surgery 
involves removing bone, muscle, skin or fat from one area of the body where 
tissue can be spared and transplanting it to where it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, rather than enduring a disfiguring mastectomy, women with breast 
cancer can now have a diseased breast removed by a general surgeon and another 
breast constructed by a plastic surgeon from tissue in the abdomen or buttocks 
-- all in one operation. 
</P>
<P>
Before microvascular free-flap surgery was developed and refined, surgeons were 
forced to rely on artificial implants or simple grafts of skin and bone. Too 
often, the artificial implants would be rejected by the body and the grafted 
tissue would die, which meant more operations and longer hospital stays, 
explains Dr. Harry Buncke Jr., of Davies Medical Center in San Francisco, the 
first American to use the free-flap technique on humans. But free-flap surgery 
has overcome both of these problems by moving functioning blood vessels and 
nerves along with transplanted tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, plastic surgeons hope to use these techniques to create "living 
spare parts" for plastic surgery. As hearts and livers are now transplanted 
from recently deceased donors, so arms and legs and noses may one day be 
successfully transplanted to traumatized or congenitally deformed patients. 
</P>
<P>
"The only challenge that remains in our way," Shaw told an international 
conference of prominent plastic surgeons last year, "is controlling the body's 
tendency to reject foreign objects, without seriously compromising the 
patient's ability to fight off infections. We are making progress." 
</P>
<P>
The next step, Shaw says, will be to create artificial body parts that are 
surgically infused with living blood vessels and nerves. Although this may 
sound like science-fiction, it is now being done on an experimental basis in 
animals. And only last year Shaw used the method on a cancer patient whose nose 
had been completely eaten away by disease and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with bone tissue from the patient's pelvis, Shaw shaped what was 
essentially a prosthetic nose. He then implanted the "nose" with man-made blood 
vessels and surgically attached the appendage to the patient's arm. There, 
blood vessels had an opportunity to establish themselves and begin to grow. 
Finally, when it was clear the nose was alive and functioning, Shaw surgically 
removed it from the patient's arm and attached it to the patient's face, where 
it now functions normally. 
</P>
<P>
In a different but equally futuristic arena, plastic surgeons are also 
experimenting with ways to operate on patients before they are born. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, for example, Dr. Walter Sullivan, chief of plastic surgery at Wayne 
State University and Children's Hospital of Michigan, published reports of the 
success he has had in repairing cleft lips "in utero." Although only performed 
on mice, the experiments illustrated the apparent ability of the fetal tissue 
to heal without scars. 
</P>
<P>
"This," according to Sullivan, "offers two possibilities that could 
revolutionize medicine: First, we may be able to spare children the necessity 
of living with disfiguring birth defects or the scars that normally occur after 
corrective surgery. And second, if we determine precisely why fetal tissue does 
not form scars, we may be able to harness that characteristic and apply it to 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, plastic surgery has already been revolutionized. New and 
detailed understanding of the anatomy of the brain, for example, has allowed 
plastic surgeons to be much more aggressive in treating trauma cases of the 
head and in correcting deformities of the face. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic surgeons can now safely open the skin on the head and cut loose bones 
so that eye sockets can be repositioned and the shape of the head itself can be 
re-formed. Gaps in normal bone structure can be filled in with bones from the 
patient's rib or pelvis. Cranial bones that are too prominent can be filed 
down. Dr. Paul Tessler, a French plastic surgeon, is generally credited with 
having been the first to develop these techniques in the 1960s, but they are 
now widely used in hospitals and medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the patients who have undergone such surgery are children who suffer from 
Down's syndrome, a chromosomal aberration that results in facial deformities as 
well as mental retardation. In some quarters, the operation has been 
controversial because it is seen as benefiting families more than patients. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have shown, however, that following reconstructive surgery, 
Down's syndrome children are assumed by other children to be friendlier and 
more intelligent than those who have not undergone such procedures. If that is 
the case, many psychiatrists and educators agree, it could have a dramatic 
implications for these children's social lives and their performance in school. 
</P>
<P>
But what about people who use plastic surgery to improve on what is already 
normal? Are the results as dramatic for them? 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, given the frequency with which they undergo it, many actors and 
models think that plastic surgery enhances their careers. Anecdotal evidence 
also suggests that in executive suites promotions are more likely to go to 
individuals who appear young and energetic. As a Wall Street Journal story put 
it, "A new face may not get you promoted but many executives think it can 
help." 
</P>
<P>
Troubled about the possible adverse emotional consequences of remodeling the 
body and face for purely cosmetic reasons, psychologists and psychiatrists have 
begun systematic studies of the effects of plastic surgery on patients. So far, 
the evidence has been somewhat contradictory, although it is clear that body 
image can have a profound impact on a person's emotional well being, according 
to USC psychiatrist Dr. Marcia Kraft Goin, author of the 1981 book "Changing 
Body: Psychological Effects of Plastic Surgery." 
</P>
<P>
The good news, Goin says, is that with time most people adjust to changes in 
their appearance. The bad news, according to Mary Ruth Wright, a psychologist 
at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, is that even when the change is for the 
better, flatter stomachs and smoother faces do almost nothing to change an 
individual's relationships with other people. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the techniques that have so revolutionized reconstructive surgery have 
made cosmetic surgery safer, better and longer-lasting. Face lifts, for 
example, used to do little more than tighten the skin of the face, with results 
lasting only about two or three years. Now plastic surgeons literally lift up 
the entire face, removing skin where there is too much, adding fat where there 
is too little, shifting muscle where it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
One of the procedures growing fastest in popularity was developed in the late 
1970s by another French plastic surgeon, Dr. Yves-Gerard Illouz. Known by 
various names, lipoplasty or "body contouring" is a procedure that surgically 
sucks fat from the body. 
</P>
<P>
Although no remedy for cellulite, stretch marks, flabby skin or overall 
obesity, the technique can be used on buttocks, ankles, abdomens, flanks and 
other parts of the body where recalcitrant fat protrudes and resists diet and 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of serious complications from these and other procedures has 
diminished in recent years, but that does not mean there are no risks 
associated with plastic surgery. The danger of excessive scarring, 
life-threatening infections and other complications runs about 5%, although it 
can average as high as 10% for liposuctions and abdominoplasties, otherwise 
known as "tummy tucks." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the worst problem for would-be patients is finding a surgeon. Not that 
there is any dearth of them. There are so many with so many different kinds of 
qualifications that patients have no idea where to begin looking. 
</P>
<P>
Many surgeons, even the good ones, are increasingly doing operations in offices 
and clinics rather than in hospitals or medical centers. Although having a 
minor operation done in a well-equipped clinic is not necessarily dangerous, 
having any operation done by a surgeon who is not well enough qualified to be 
affiliated with a reputable hospital can be dangerous indeed. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington last spring, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on 
Regulation, Business Opportunities and Energy heard one horror story after 
another from patients who were the victims of botched surgeries by incompetent 
surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Following a six-month investigation into alleged unscrupulous practices by 
under-qualified physicians, the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Ron Wyden 
(D-Ore.), concluded that plastic surgery is "a dangerously under-regulated 
medical field" where physicians can practice with no special licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Although speciality boards were created to standardize credentialing, there are 
now thought to be several dozen such boards in plastic surgery. Only one -- the 
American Board of Plastic Surgery -- is recognized in plastic surgery by the 
American Medical Assn. and the American Board of Medical Specialists and 
requires written and oral examinations, a minimum of a three-year residency in 
general surgery or orthopedics and an additional two to three years of 
specialty training in plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the main 
professional organization of these board-certified plastic surgeons, has done 
its best in recent years to warn consumers of the hazards of going to 
under-qualified doctors. But recently it also, in the view of some critics, has 
exacerbated the problems by equating cosmetic surgery in the public's mind with 
vacations, cars and ordinary household purchases. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the society introduced a nationwide financing program, not unlike 
those offered by some individual surgeons, to help middle-income individuals 
find a way to pay for plastic surgery. Administered by Household Retail 
Services Inc., a subsidiary of Household International Finance, the program 
features loans that promise "no drain on credit-card limits, no annual fee, 
small monthly payments, no minimum financing amount, prompt credit approval and 
confidential arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
Explains Dr. John Jarrett, president of the society: "Financing plans have made 
options like vacations, a second car or a change in furniture possible for 
middle-class Americans -- and cosmetic surgery is no exception." 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has unwittingly contributed to problems associated with 
plastic surgery when the Federal Trade Commission in the late 1970s opened the 
way for doctors to advertise their services. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the public has been deluged with aggressive advertising campaigns, 
some quite misleading. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best known came to light during the hearings of the Subcommittee on 
Regulation, Business Opportunities and Energy. It involved an eight-page 
fold-out in Los Angeles Magazine that featured, among other things, a 
well-endowed female model clad in a bathing suit and standing next to a sleek 
sports car. "Automobile by Ferrari. Body by Forshan," the ad read. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the subcommittee concluded that Dr. Vincent Forshan, a plastic surgeon 
from Rancho Mirage who placed the ad, had never worked on the model. She had 
been the patient of Dr. Charles Smithdeal, a Los Angeles plastic surgeon. 
Smithdeal subsequently took out his own ad, using the same model, another 
Ferrari but a slightly different message: "Body by Smithdeal." 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising is a two-edged sword," concludes UCLA's Shaw. "It is important for 
the public to be aware of what's available in a field that is changing so 
rapidly and (that is) capable of doing so much for so many people." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he cautions: "The ability to advertise bears no correlation 
to the ability to operate."

By MARK BELLO, Bello is a writer based in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything is sweetened by risk," observes a 19th Century treatise on the fear 
of dying. 
</P>
<P>
Well, perhaps not everything. The pleasures of sunbathing, for example, do not 
increase with the realization that the sun's ultraviolet rays can cause skin 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But risk, in other forms, seems to have partakers who are more avid than others 
-- people who get a certain charge out of performing acts that pose physical, 
social or financial peril. In itself, risk is not the prime motivation for 
behavior that the more timid among us might deem as crazy, according to 
psychologists. Rock climbers and tightrope walkers don't harbor a secret death 
wish; venture capitalists don't invest in start-up businesses because the 
majority of enterprises fail within the first five years; struggling artists 
don't persist because their works are ignored by critics. Yet, because of the 
lurking potential for failure and even disaster, most of us steer clear of such 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody engages in risk taking just for the sake of it," says 
Louis J. West, UCLA professor of psychiatry. "What we describe as 'risky' is a 
value judgment placed on somebody else's behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists and other researchers note that people vary greatly in their 
tolerance for life's "sweetener" and the uncertainty that, by definition, risk 
carries. Those who have a powerful hunger for variety and intensity of 
experience do have fears, says University of Delaware psychologist Marvin 
Zuckerman. But they appraise risks differently than people who are strongly 
drawn to the predictable and who receive ample stimulation from familiar 
surroundings and routine activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of the high-sensation seekers," Zuckerman wrote in an article 
published in 1988, "seems to be: 'Yes, it's risky, but everything will turn out 
fine for me, and I will feel good.' The attitude of the low-sensation seeker 
is: 'Everything bad that can happen will happen, and I will be devastated.' " 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from several lines of research suggests that some of those who cross 
to the "wild side" of the fuzzy boundary of conventional behavior may have an 
inherited biochemical predisposition that makes them more likely to take risks. 
Moreover, the further one's behavior moves him or her away from that boundary, 
according to emerging theories, the closer he moves to the clinical domain of 
manic-depressive illness, a biochemically-based disorder characterized by 
marked swings between extreme elation and deep melancholy. Finally, there are 
indications that the willingness to take risks is a critical psychological link 
between the need for exhilarating physical or mental experiences and the drive 
to create. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the basis for risk taking, determining why one individual will spend a 
Sunday afternoons kayaking in the seething rapids of a river while another 
person regularly opts for a lawn chair and the newspaper may say much about who 
we are as individuals.

Using scales that measure, for example, "sensation seeking," "thrill seeking," 
"monotony avoidance" and "constraint," researchers have found that the 
propensity to engage in physically or socially risky acts is deeply -- perhaps 
biochemically -- ingrained in one's personality and may even be inherited. 
Zuckerman has spent 25 years studying "sensation seekers," using a composite 
scale that measures the "need for varied, novel and complex sensations and 
experiences and the willingness to take physical and social risks." He says 
some forms of mania resemble "sensation-seeking behavior that is out of 
control." Even when their disorder abates, manic depressives rate high in 
sensation seeking, according to Zuckerman's research. Other studies have found 
that the brains of people who suffer bouts of mania are biologically similar to 
those of normal sensation seekers. 
</P>
<P>
In sensation seekers, Zuckerman suggests, fluctuations in the distribution of 
chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters, and other compounds may alter the 
brain's regulatory mechanisms. One consequence, he says, may be that higher 
levels of stimulation are needed just to trigger the brain's internal reward 
system. That may account for the reason that high-sensation seekers run 
inordinately high risks of using cocaine or other stimulant drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Also implicated in sensation seeking -- particularly in males who seek 
stimulation through drinking, partying, gambling and sexual variety -- are high 
levels of male sex hormones, Zuckerman says. The hormones' suspected influence 
may account for the greater prevalence of sensation seeking among males, 
especially adolescents and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most compelling evidence for a biological underpinning of risk 
taking comes from the University of Minnesota's large-scale study of identical 
twins who were raised apart. The Minnesota scientists concluded that about half 
of our personality is inherited, with the remainder shaped by the family, peers 
and other environmental influences. Particularly strong was the correspondence 
between twins for the personality trait that corresponds closely to sensation 
seeking. Nearly 60% of the time, a twin who was impulsive and reckless, enjoyed 
dangerous kinds of activities and questioned authority had an identical 
counterpart who shared those and other traits that are the hallmarks of 
sensation seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the similarities bordered on the uncanny. Consider Jerry Levy of 
Tinton Falls, N.J., and Mark Newman of Paramus, N.J., 65 miles away. Separated 
five days after birth and unaware of each other's existence, the identical 
twins were reunited at age 31. Among their many shared traits was a love of 
motorcycles, a raucous joviality and an avocation that ranks high on any 
risk-taking scale: Both are volunteer firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"A clear streak of wildness runs through some of the twin pairs," Tellegen 
says. "Of course, the opposite (shared high levels of caution and a preference 
for the routine rather than the adventurous) is also true. I think it's good 
for the species to have people on both sides." People who are driven by a 
desire for the novel and exciting and, as a result, the risky, may blaze new 
paths, he says, but they may not be the kind of people you want working in a 
nuclear power plant or "steering an oil tanker from port to port." 
</P>
<P>
If one accepts -- and not everybody does -- the theory that some people are 
more predisposed to taking risks than others, an important question remains: 
What do they get in return? One pay-back may be a feeling of euphoria. From 
reports of cliff divers and others, "we know that taking enormous risks often 
translates into tremendous highs," says Lewis P. Lipsitt, a Brown University 
psychologist who is studying infants and children to identify factors that may 
foster risk-taking or inhibition later in life. "We also know that some people 
need a sense of risk in their sexual encounters. For them, the threat of 
'getting caught' has an enhancing effect." 
</P>
<P>
Or it may be that some people engage in risky activities just to achieve a 
normal state of arousal, suggests the University of Wisconsin's Farley, who has 
devised a series of measures to assess "thrill seeking." A barrage of sensory 
signals -- having the stereo on while talking on the telephone and 
simultaneously paging through a magazine -- may be more than most people can 
handle. But those who rate high on Farley's thrill-seeking scale -- he calls 
them Big Ts -- may need all this stimulation to "rev up an under-aroused 
nervous system." 
</P>
<P>
Although not wedded to the arousal concept, Farley has found that Big Ts tend 
to be "experimenters with life," exploring and seeking variety in everything 
from their surroundings to their sex lives. Their curiosity, he says, is aided 
by an ability to think concretely and abstractly, fostering high levels of 
creativity, which Farley has observed among many of the thrill seekers he has 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
The work of Farley and Zuckerman closely parallels new research on the sources 
of human creativity. 'Someone who does something new is a minority of one," 
says psychiatrist Ruth Richards, who with psychologist Dennis Kinney developed 
a scale to measure how creative people are in their jobs and hobbies. As a 
result, creative individuals often must be willing to face the chances of 
failure and the potential for social disapproval, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in fields that ostensibly value creativity -- the arts and the sciences 
-- true creativity challenges the status quo and carries the risk of getting 
punished or ostracized," says Kinney, who along with Richards is a staff member 
of the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., and the Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, researchers have been exploring the origins of human 
creativity, following up on anecdotal evidence that many eminent writers, 
composers and other artists suffered from manic-depressive illness. Examples 
include writers Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, Herman Melville, Edgar Allan 
Poe, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Lord Byron. Among composers, Handel, Mahler and 
Tchaikovsky were known to have mood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of living artists strongly indicate a biochemical connection between 
creativity and manic-depressive illness. Extraordinarily high rates of the 
disorder -- usually a third or higher -- have been found in samples of top 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Richards and Kinney took a different tack. Instead of studying acknowledged 
artists, they concentrated on people who are creative in more common pursuits. 
Their findings add a twist to the link between creativity and mood disorders. 
People who are most creative in their everyday lives, according to the 
research, are not individuals who suffer from the full-fledged disorder but 
rather those who experience milder mood swings or are simply members of a 
family with a manic-depressive member. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists suggest that in exchange for a presumed genetic risk of 
developing a mood-swing disorder -- shared by up to 15 million Americans, 
according to some estimates -- these people are equipped with a "compensatory 
advantage" of creative potential. The result, Richards speculates, is a "richer 
thought process, greater emotional awareness, and motivating energy." 
</P>
<P>
Whether these individuals tap this apparently innate reservoir of creativity 
may depend on their propensity to take risks. Those who do, Richards suggests, 
may already view themselves as standing outside of mainstream society and may 
be more willing to experiment with novel ideas. Or, she says, the drive to 
create may generate internal rewards that are reaped during the process of 
creating. 
</P>
<P>
While risk taking can be healthy, it has a dark side, destructive to the 
individual and sometimes to society. The most reckless forms of behavior, 
however, may not have anything to do with the willingness to take risks but are 
a denial of fear. UCLA's West classifies Russian roulette, playing chicken on 
the highway, and other seemingly irrational, lethal behavior as 
"counterphobic." 
</P>
<P>
"The motivation behind this kind of behavior is to prove to oneself and to 
others that you are not afraid," he says. "The more fear one has, the more 
powerful the 'counterphobic' force to deny it. Denying one's timidity results 
in foolhardy behavior of the worst kind." 
</P>
<P>
Still, much of what is regarded as destructive behavior may stem from the need 
for stimulation through socially unacceptable activities. Both Zuckerman and 
Farley contend that a strong desire for excitement, which tends to decline in 
adulthood, may be a major factor in juvenile delinquency. Without constructive 
outlets, they speculate, boys and young men are more apt to engage in criminal 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unrecognized how much of a role sensation seeking plays in juvenile 
delinquency," Zuckerman contends. 
</P>
<P>
In an unpublished study, Farley and his associates found that thrill seekers 
were about twice as likely to be involved in automobile accidents than those 
who rate low on his scales. Combining this disparity with the tendency of young 
thrill seekers to drink alcohol and use drugs, Farley suggests that efforts to 
improve highway safety would be more successful if they were tailored to the 
individuals behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"We lowered and then raised the drinking age; yet accidents are the No. 1 cause 
of death among teens and young adults," he says. "Psychology has helped us 
understand and address problems at other stages of life, but we haven't done 
this with adolescents. Adolescents are dying of their own behavior. It's a 
psychological problem, and we should treat it that way." 
</P>
<P>
In another study, Farley found that thrill seekers from high-income families 
tended to find stimulation in socially acceptable outlets. Thrill seekers in 
the lower income groups were more likely to be involved in delinquent 
activities. The findings, Farley says, suggest that the difference between 
constructive and destructive risk taking may be a matter of whether families 
and social institutions are able to provide safe options, such as sports, for 
satisfying one's need for stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers approach risk taking by studying the cognitive processes by 
which one makes decisions. These investigators view the situation somewhat 
differently. Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie-Mellon University, for example, 
concedes that some people may be more willing to take risks than most, but he 
contends that "people behave differently on a lot of different dimensions. They 
may be cautious at work, for example, but not at home." 
</P>
<P>
Adds John Payne, a professor of business administration at Duke University, who 
studies how businesses handle risk, "I think there's more to be understood by 
looking at the environment in which people are working," rather than at 
personality differences. To support his view, Payne notes that middle-level 
managers tend to be "more risk-averse and worry more about the probability of 
failure" than their superiors, and that businesses are more likely to take 
risks during bad times. 
</P>
<P>
Fischhoff, now involved in a major study of how adolescents make decisions, 
says the difference between reckless risk taking and constructive risk taking 
is often the amount of information people have and how they process that 
information. Like the adults he has studied, Fischhoff has found that youths 
tend to "overestimate their knowledge" of risks and underestimate the potential 
dangers of particular behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, "kids know a lot," he says. "Where they fail is putting 
information together to make decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of their disciplinary perspectives, researchers agree that some 
degree of risk taking -- what most of us would call calculated risk taking -- 
is beneficial. Experimenting, exploring options and seeking out new experiences 
can enrich life, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Without some risk taking, an individual becomes "trapped in a single 
perspective," says Ellen Langer, Harvard University psychologist and author of 
the book "Mindfulness." "You're in a rut and don't even know it." 
</P>
<P>
Langer and other experts aren't recommending that people set out immediately to 
scale a mountain peak, or that they go into work tomorrow and demand a raise 
from their curmudgeonly boss, although, for some, such risk taking might be 
appropriate. Risk can be taken in doses, big and small. 
</P>
<P>
"If you always eat at the same restaurant, you'll never discover a new one," 
Fischhoff quips. "You'll never find out that you like Thai food."

ONE THIRD OF ALL CANCER DEATHS MAY BE RELATED TO WHAT WE EAT. YET IT'S UNCLEAR 
JUST WHAT PROMOTES THE DISEASE OR PROTECTS AGAINST IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen women sat in a circle in a UCLA classroom one recent evening, hashing 
out the intricacies of fats -- those insidious passengers in five-cheese 
risotto and creme brulee that may well be lurking behind the rising rates of 
certain cancers. 
</P>
<P>
They were educated, accomplished women. They wore bifocals and blazers, badges 
of professional middle-age. But as the evening wore on, the conversation turned 
confessional: They talked about dessert the way recovering alcoholics talk 
about a drink. 
</P>
<P>
Could you eat pumpkin pie without the crust? Could you use mozzarella in 
macaroni and cheese and have it not be stringy? What to do with that leftover 
stuffing beckoning from the freezer? Anyone know how many fat grams reside in a 
chicken-fajita pita? 
</P>
<P>
Their monthly version of dietary group therapy is part of a nationwide research 
project looking into whether women can stick to a low-fat regimen. If they can, 
a larger study has been proposed to explore, over many years, whether a low-fat 
diet might cut one's risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of even this first study remains unclear. As the participants tell 
it, they lurch between abstinence and overindulgence. But if they succeed in 
minimizing their fat intake, Marilyn Aronson, who conducted the UCLA session, 
believes there is much to be gained. 
</P>
<P>
"Diet is not involved in every kind of cancer," says Aronson, a clinical 
research nutritionist. "But I do believe that there are a lot of people 
suffering from cancer who might have been able to avoid it, or at least delay 
it, had they eaten differently." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated one third of all cancer deaths may be related to the food we eat. 
That's as many as, perhaps more than, can be traced to tobacco. With some 
485,000 cancer deaths in the United States each year, that means 160,000 people 
will die of cancers traceable to diet. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, precisely what it is in foods that promotes cancer or protects against it 
remains unclear. The question is hotly debated. Most researchers agree that 
alcohol consumption and obesity play a central role in certain cancers. But 
beyond that, there is little consensus. 
</P>
<P>
Dietary fats are a prime suspect. They have been linked to cancers of the 
colon, breast, prostate and lining of the uterus. But research on the 
relationship between fats and cancer is contradictory, and some experts believe 
the problem may be calories, not fats. 
</P>
<P>
Fiber, too, has attracted much attention. Many believe it helps protect against 
colon cancer. Again, research findings conflict. Skeptics wonder whether to 
credit the fiber in high-fiber diets, or simply the diets' relative paucity of 
fats. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are vitamins. Foods rich in Vitamin C and Vitamin E may inhibit 
colon tumors, research suggests, while those containing Vitamin A and its 
precursors may protect against cancer of the lung. But are the vitamins 
themselves responsible, or is it something else in those foods? 
</P>
<P>
Answering these questions is surprisingly difficult. One reason is that few 
people can recall in detail what they have eaten. Research subjects may 
remember what they swallowed yesterday, or last week, but not 15 years ago when 
perhaps it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, some foods themselves are not well understood. Take fiber: There 
are more than half-a-dozen types. How much of each type is in which foods has 
begun to have been studied only recently. And even less is known about how each 
affects the body. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the process leading to cancer remains somewhat mysterious. It can take 
decades, involving factors that range from environment to genetics. How diet 
might influence that process -- promoting or retarding it -- has yet to be 
fully explained. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts say one thing is certain: Diet, like smoking, is one of 
the few cancer risk factors over which people have control. So experts have 
offered road maps for eating that may help protect against cancer, and 
certainly against other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Those guidelines -- set forth over the past decade by the National Cancer 
Institute and American Cancer Society, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American 
Heart Assn. and the National Research Council -- stress the following 
principles: 
</P>
<P>
Avoid obesity. Drink alcohol only in moderation. Fats in the diet should 
account for no more than 30% of daily calories. The current American average is 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
Eat more foods high in fiber, such as whole-grain cereals, fruits and 
vegetables. The NCI recommends a daily fiber intake of 20 to 30 grams, rather 
than the current average of 11. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to include vitamin-rich yellow and dark-green, leafy vegetables; red, 
yellow and orange vegetables and fruits; citrus fruits, and juices made from 
any of those. 
</P>
<P>
Limit salt-cured, pickled and smoked foods, which many researchers believe 
raise one's risk of stomach and esophageal cancers. Minimize consumption of 
grilled or broiled foods that have become charred, since charring can produce 
carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
As some see it, our problems stem in part from the fact that our species 
evolved on the basis of a different diet than we now eat. For most of 
existence, humans subsisted on a high-fiber, low-fat diet. Only with 
industrialization came profound change. 
</P>
<P>
According to Leonard A. Cohen, an expert on diet and breast cancer at the 
American Health Foundation in New York, prehistoric people got about 20% of 
their calories from dietary fats. They ate three times the fiber we eat and 
four times the Vitamin C, consuming a diet heavy in grains, vegetables and 
fruits. 
</P>
<P>
That pattern prevailed until the Industrial Revolution some 2 1/2 centuries 
ago. With increasing affluence and changing tastes, fat consumption began to 
climb. Fiber intake dropped, consumption of refined sugars went up, consumption 
of complex carbohydrates down. 
</P>
<P>
Those dietary changes, combined with a less active lifestyle, are believed to 
have been responsible for the increased size of modern people, Cohen says. They 
also account for the rise in obesity, earlier maturation, cardiovascular 
disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Our diet has changed faster, it appears, than our physiology can adapt. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, then, modern people are living in a biological time warp," Cohen 
wrote in 1987. "Their Stone Age physiology contends daily with a 20th-Century 
diet to which it is poorly adapted." 
</P>
<P>
How exactly might dietary changes influence cancer risk? 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that the cancer process has several stages. As Cohen 
describes it, it is triggered by an initiator, such as a carcinogen or a virus. 
The initiating agent permanently damages the body's genetic material. A 
mutation results, setting the stage for the possible development of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Later, some other agent, known as a promoter, picks up the process, causing the 
damaged cells to multiply and create a tumor. Some elements in the diet, such 
as fats, may be promoters, researchers say. Others, like vitamins, may help 
derail the process. 
</P>
<P>
The most widely studied of those nutrients is fat. Evidence from animal studies 
in the 1940s first suggested that fats might increase a person's cancer risk. 
Rodents fed high-fat diets in those and subsequent studies proved more likely 
than others to develop mammary tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Then researchers began noticing international differences: People in countries 
with high-fat diets had higher breast-cancer rates. And those emigrating from 
low-fat to high-fat countries quickly took on the breast-cancer rate of their 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
One hypothesis goes like this: Fats influence levels of hormones, such as 
estrogen. Estrogen appears to be important in the development of breast cancer. 
By raising estrogen levels, fats in the diet may increase a woman's 
breast-cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
A similar hypothesis exists for prostate cancer, which, some studies indicate, 
also is influenced by dietary fats. Some researchers suspect that fat promotes 
prostate cancer by increasing levels of the hormone testosterone in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of breast cancer, some researchers are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, there are a lot of things that go along with eating fat -- 
like sitting down, having early menarche and having Cadillacs," says Malcolm 
Pike, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
ight something else in our lifestyle be to blame? 
</P>
<P>
To try to eliminate such confounding factors, researchers narrowed their focus. 
They began studying differences in breast-cancer rates in the United States. 
They looked at Seventh Day Adventists, who avoid eating meat. They studied 
nurses, hospital patients, pre- and post-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings have been mixed. Some studies have found an association between 
fat and breast cancer; others have not. One large study of women nurses found 
no more breast cancer among nurses who ate the most fat than among those who 
ate the least. 
</P>
<P>
There are several possible explanations. Differences in fat intake in the 
United States may be too slim to produce measurable differences in cancer risk. 
Or, studies may have been designed in such a way as to be unable to flush out a 
connection, even if one exists. 
</P>
<P>
For example, most of the studies have been retrospective. That is, they 
recorded and analyzed diet after the fact. Researchers have interviewed women 
with and without breast cancer, attempting to piece together how the women ate 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But, as noted, people have great difficulty recalling what they eat. (One study 
found that people recalled correctly less than half the time.) What's more, 
researchers say, fat is an especially problematic nutrient to estimate with 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Inaccuracy tends to be a neutralizing force. Researchers have studied its 
impact using hypothetical cases. Even in cases where associations exist, 
researchers have found that incorrect measurement tends to obscure, rather than 
exaggerate, real links. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the possibility that fat, or fat alone, is not the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
David Kritchevsky, associate director of Philadelphia's Wistar Institute, the 
nation's oldest biological-research institute, believes that the real issue is 
calories. Our high calorie intake and low calorie expenditure has elevated our 
cancer risk, he theorizes. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, Kritchevsky and others fed one set of rats five times the fat, 
but 25% fewer calories, than they fed a control group of rats. The 
lower-calorie rats, despite their high-fat diet, developed significantly fewer 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
"The major thing is calories," contends Kritchevsky, who believes that people 
may be able to reduce much of the risk from a high-calorie diet by burning off 
more calories. "Maybe the answer (to the nation's high rate of breast cancer) 
is to eat 20% less." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of colon cancer and fat is similarly contentious. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers have concluded that a high-fat diet doubles one's risk of 
colon cancer. Others have found similar associations. One study linked meats, 
specifically, to the disease. Others have found no connection. 
</P>
<P>
One theory is that fats might promote colon cancer by stimulating bile acids, 
which have been found to promote tumors in animals. (Some experts suggest that 
dietary calcium, by neutralizing the bile acids, might counteract that effect.) 
</P>
<P>
But many questions remain: Which types of fats are especially problematic? Is 
total calorie intake more significant than fat? Can burning a lot of calories 
help? Finally, what is the effect of any interaction between fats and dietary 
fiber? 
</P>
<P>
Fiber, which is plant material that is resistant to digestion, first attracted 
attention in the early 1970s. Researchers working in Africa noticed that 
African men on high-fiber diets had relatively low rates of death from colon 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, that association has been explored extensively. The results, 
predictably, are conflicting. Of 40 studies in one review, 32 found that fiber 
cut one's risk of colon cancer. Six were equivocal, or found no association, 
and two found that fiber increased the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Why should fiber work against colon cancer? 
</P>
<P>
By adding bulk, it may decrease the concentration of carcinogens in fecal 
matter that come in contact with the lining of the colon. Also, by speeding up 
so-called "intestinal transit time," it may minimize that contact between 
carcinogens and intestinal tissue. 
</P>
<P>
But fiber is more complicated than was initially recognized. Many early studies 
measured only the crude fiber, rather than the total fiber, in foods. 
Researchers say those studies underestimated the amount of fiber being 
consumed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a laboratory in Madison, Wis., researchers are analyzing the fiber 
content in foods. They are meticulously isolating and extricating half a dozen 
types of fiber and preparing a fiber profile of 400 common foods. 
</P>
<P>
For each food, they are identifying nine attributes -- a testament to the 
complexity of fiber: total, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber values; the 
amounts of various types of fiber -- hemicellulose, pectin, mucilage, cellulose 
and lignin; and, for oats and barley, the gum content. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 foods have been analyzed so far, says Judith Marlett, a registered 
dietitian and professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Wisconsin. 
Within the next few years, she and her co-workers expect to produce a chart for 
use in research studies and in designing diets. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the physiological effects of each type of fiber remain unknown. And some 
researchers remain doubtful that fiber itself is especially beneficial. 
High-fiber diets tend also to be low in fat and heavy on fruits and vegetables, 
which are high in beneficial micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Among fruits and vegetables, research interest has focused in particular on 
dark-green, leafy vegetables and so-called cruciferous vegetables such as 
Brussels sprouts, cabbage and mustard greens, as well as red, yellow and orange 
fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Many are high in Vitamin A and its precursor, beta carotene, a form of pigment 
found in carrots, tomatoes and green, leafy vegetables. People who regularly 
eat those foods appear to have a relatively low risk of lung cancer. Some 
research suggests they also protect against prostate, bladder, esophageal and 
stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
he evidence on lung cancer is especially striking, researchers say. In general, 
studies have found that smokers and former smokers who took in relatively 
little beta carotene were nearly twice as likely to develop lung cancer as 
those in the studies who consumed the most. 
</P>
<P>
Research also suggests that beta carotene from fruits and vegetables, rather 
than Vitamin A from animal sources, carries the greatest protective benefit for 
people who have smoked (who are at the greatest risk of getting lung cancer). 
But it is not known whether the advantage is greatest for heavy smokers or for 
light smokers and ex-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear, too, whether other micronutrients might be responsible for the 
benefit of fruits and vegetables. But lack of food-composition data in the past 
has prevented epidemiologists from focusing on the contributions of pigments 
other than beta carotene. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if you should take beta carotene or be eating a can of spinach," 
says Dr. Brian Henderson, director of the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center at 
USC and a prominent researcher of diet and cancer. "You know, maybe Popeye was 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are several other links between diet and cancer being explored: 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence, though contradictory, suggesting that Vitamin C and 
Vitamin E may slow the development of colon cancer. And there are suggestions 
that Vitamin C may protect against stomach cancer, perhaps by blocking the 
formation of certain carcinogens called nitrosamines. 
</P>
<P>
Consumption of salt-cured and salt-pickled foods has been tied to cancers of 
the stomach and mouth. They contain nitrates and nitrites that can form 
nitrosamines, which have been linked to cancer of the mouth and stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Broiling and grilling over an open flame can produce carcinogenic hydrocarbons 
when fat comes in contact with flames or hot coals. For that reason, health 
experts recommend wrapping food in foil when barbecuing and keeping it a good 
distance from the coals. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the questions about diet and cancer remain unresolved because of the 
difficulty of designing studies capable of producing unambiguous results. 
</P>
<P>
For example, because a nutrient is associated in a study with an increased risk 
of cancer does not necessarily mean that it is responsible for that increase. 
</P>
<P>
To eliminate those shortcomings, researchers have resorted to studies of 
animals, manipulating their diets to simulate human experience. But whether it 
is really possible to extrapolate from findings on animals remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of overcoming many of the limitations of past research, a group of 
researchers has proposed a massive federal study of women and cancer. As many 
as 32,000 middle-aged women would be recruited and followed closely for a 
decade, perhaps more. 
</P>
<P>
Half would remain on their current diets. The other half would be placed on a 
low-fat diet. Advocates of the controversial trial predict that a diet in which 
only 20% of calories came from fat could reduce the incidence of breast cancer 
alone by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
(The monthly meetings led by Marilyn Aronson in Los Angeles are part of a 
smaller study exploring the feasibility of conducting such a trial.) 
</P>
<P>
But the trial, predicted to cost more than $100 million, would be the most 
expensive ever funded by the federal National Cancer Institute. And many 
researchers question whether even a project of that magnitude could provide 
conclusive results. 
</P>
<P>
They wonder whether altering diet in middle age would produce a measureable 
reduction in cancer risk, or whether it would be necessary to start in young 
adulthood, or earlier, to prove that a low-fat diet would make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the study -- such as Ross Prentice, director of the division of 
public-health sciences at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle 
-- contend that the study is warranted. Without it, they say, the issue of diet 
and cancer may never be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm worried about is that we simply may never get the answer" to whether 
dietary fat contributes to the high cancer rates in the United States, Prentice 
says. "I'm not at all sure that other studies likely to be done will give us 
clear answers."
