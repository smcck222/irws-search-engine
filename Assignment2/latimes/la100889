SPENDTHRIFT JAPAN?;

THE SUN ALSO SETS: THE LIMITS TO JAPAN'S ECONOMIC POWER BY BILL EMMOTT; (TIMES 
BOOKS: $18.95; 250 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Toyotas and Nissans invaded the American market many years ago, 
books and articles about Japan have been written in successive waves. The first 
admired such Japanese business practices as teamwork, government-industry 
cooperation and long-term planning. Then came concern about America losing its 
competitive edge and prescriptions about how American policies must change. 
</P>
<P>
Recently a new concept has caught on. America is handcuffed, so the argument 
goes, because Japan is fundamentally different from other Western nations: 
neither capitalist nor socialist but something more perniciously 
mercantilistic. According to this reasoning, Washington must press Japan to 
change fundamentally its economic structure and its social customs in order to 
import more and to save less -- to be, well, more like us. If necessary, 
economic retaliation may be called for. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Emmott's "The Sun Also Sets" may not start yet another wave of opinion, 
but it should cause many of us to think hard about the latest hysteria. The 
book has at its core one powerful idea: Japan's economic power arose incredibly 
quickly -- just since the beginning of this decade -- and it is likely to 
contract just as fast. As a result, Emmott says, fears about Tokyo's buying up 
the world and having political clout to match are wildly misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
Is this science fiction concerning a nation which is now banker to the world 
and expanding at breakneck pace its corporate empire to every corner of the 
globe? Not as presented here. Emmott's notions are not based on predictions of 
an earthquake or a nuclear- reactor catastrophe or anything so accidental. 
Instead, the author, who is business and financial editor and former Tokyo 
correspondent of the highly respected British weekly newsmagazine "The 
Economist," presents a logical and unemotional case for how underlying social 
and economic forces in Japan are causing it to save less and spend more, and 
how these changes feed on themselves and cause meaningful change. 
</P>
<P>
The root of Japan's economic power, says Emmott, is its enormous mountains of 
surplus cash, the result of phenomenal export performances and a consistently 
high savings rate. If you make a straight-line projection of current trends for 
another decade, he admits, Japan would be able to buy the equivalent of several 
European countries. But it is a big mistake to extrapolate that way, he warns, 
because Japan's society is anything but static. His prediction: Well before the 
1990s is over, Japan's financial surplus will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation of producers," the author writes, "is becoming a nation of 
consumers, eager to accumulate material possessions, to buy foreign goods, and 
even to show off wealth in conspicuous displays. The nation of workaholics is 
becoming a nation of pleasure-seekers, eager to travel abroad, to enjoy 
leisure, and to find whatever is best in life. The nation of healthy, 
education-mad youth is becoming a nation of healthy pensioners, as the 
baby-boom generation ages and lifespans lengthen. The nation of squirrel-like 
savers, whose cash was controlled by the government, is becoming a nation of 
investors and, most astonishingly of all, a nation of speculators." 
</P>
<P>
Emmott traces each of the changes in Japanese society and shows how they will 
curb Japan's financial power. One striking example is the growth of Japanese 
travel abroad. By 1991, about 15 million Japanese could be leaving the country 
each year, spending over $20 billion abroad, an amount equal to a reduction of 
Japan's current trade surplus today by 20%. Another intriguing case is the 
impact of the graying population on the savings rate. Japan will soon have more 
citizens over 65 than any other industrialized nation, and pensioners are 
spenders and not savers. Other trends include: rapidly rising imports, 
particularly from South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia; 
massive requirements to spend more on housing and social services; and an 
increasingly deregulated banking system that will reduce government influence 
on how and where consumers spend and save. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sun Also Sets" seeks to change the current framework for thinking about 
Japanese power. It is not predicting that Japan will become a second rate 
nation, but only that it will not be the superpower so many people seem to 
fear. Emmott says that upcoming economic pressures on Japan, together with the 
nation's natural reluctance to assume visible leadership abroad, will assure 
very limited political and military clout in the world, with the one exception 
of East Asia where growing influence is well advanced and probably unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
Although the author has not done much original research, he supports his case 
with reference to a variety of respectable sources from governments, think 
tanks, and banks. There is no pretense of infallibility, but there is a high 
degree of confidence that tomorrow will not look like today. Emmott is throwing 
down a glove in front of the current "Japan is different and unmovable" school. 
"The Japanese are not a breed apart," he says. "They respond to low prices by 
buying more imports; they respond to affluence by buying expensive things; they 
respond to financial freedom by seeking out good deals or a quick killing; they 
respond to better and more secure pensions by saving less of their incomes." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the limits of Japan's power was first published by Emmott last year 
in an essay that won top awards from a prestigious international panel of 
bankers, economists, and politicians. In that condensed form it was even more 
effective than the book, which suffers from diversions into tiresome issues 
like whether foreign investment is good for the United States, how Japanese 
banking was eventually liberalized, and why the United States should pay more 
attention to competitiveness, etc. Given the added writing space, however, 
Emmott might have given us a better context for evaluating his predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Emmott is the latest of several new commentators on Japan from the press. In 
fact, America's view about Japan is being heavily influenced today by 
journalists, not in their capacity as unbiased news reporters, but as authors 
of books and articles in which they present their personal views of problems 
and solutions, often in highly emotional form. James Fallows of "The Atlantic 
Monthly" has been attacking Japan's economic aggressiveness. Karel van 
Wolferen, a distinguished Dutch reporter who recently published "The Enigma of 
Japanese Power" accuses Japan of having a feudal political system where no one 
makes decisions. Martin Tolchin of the New York Times warns about the threat 
from foreign investors in "Buying Into America: How Foreign Money is Changing 
the Face of Our Nation." Free lancer Daniel Burstein's view is evident from the 
title of his new book: "YEN! Japan's New Financial Empire and Its Threat to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
We are fortunate to have top writers with access to people who make news, 
unlike scholars buried in library stacks. But we should beware, too, for 
journalists can be superb at following a single story line, even if it is too 
simplistic. They can be masters of the penetrating anecdote, even if it is 
misleading. And they are often preoccupied with what's hot today, regardless of 
its connection to past or future. 
</P>
<P>
Emmott may share the shortcoming of shallow research. However, he is way ahead 
of the pack in thoughtfulness, originality, and recognition of the interplay of 
dynamic social, economic and political forces. He is adding much needed balance 
and perspective to the raging debate about Japan and his book should be widely 
read and hotly debated.

The Emmy Awards show was full of surprises all right. While "War and 
Remembrance" won a hard-earned Emmy for best miniseries, its stars Jane Seymour 
and John Gielgud lost out to Holly Hunter of "Roe vs. Wade" and James Woods of 
"My Name Is Bill W." How could members of the TV academy overlook two of last 
year's best performances? Perhaps they have other social/political concerns in 
mind as they cast their ballots? Or maybe major "movie actors" who rarely do TV 
are favored over their TV counterparts? A word to those who deserved to win but 
did not: Don't be discouraged and keep up the good work. Incidentally, win or 
lose, Jane Seymour undoubtedly was the most beautiful woman on Emmy night.

</P>
<P>
THE SHAWL BY CYNTHIA OZICK, (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $12.95; 56 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ursula Hegi, Ursula Hegi is the author of Intrusions and Unearned Pleasures 
and Other Stories. She is an associate professor of English at Eastern 
Washington University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Devastating and exquisite, Cynthia Ozick's ninth book, "The Shawl," carries the 
emotional impact of a much longer work. In only 56 pages that contain a short 
story, "The Shawl," and a novella, "Rosa," Ozick creates a world that reaches 
beyond words, beyond pages, a world that evokes nightmares contained between 
the lines and leaves us mute. 
</P>
<P>
The short story is set in a concentration camp where Rosa hides her daughter in 
a shawl she has tied to herself. Nursing her daughter, she is a "walking cradle 
. . . a floating angel," and the 15-month-old Magda is "a squirrel in a nest, 
safe." But the safety is deceptive as the child sucks on her mother's dry 
breast and then on the shawl, "flooding the threads with wetness. The shawl's 
good flavor, milk of linen." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa knows her daughter cannot live for long, and that awareness cuts through 
every moment. This child who looks "Aryan" and quite likely is the consequence 
of Rosa's rape by a German soldier, needs to be protected from her cousin, 
Stella, a starving 14-year-old who surely would devour her. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene unequaled in contemporary literature, the child who has been "buried 
away deep inside the magic shawl, mistaken there for the shivering mount of 
Rosa's breasts," is thrown at an electric fence by a concentration-camp guard. 
But even here, Ozick's language transcends the gruesome facts of Magda's death 
as the child swims "through the air . . . like a butterfly touching a silver 
vine." Yet, her language does not diminish the horror but rather intensifies 
it. To protect herself with silence, Rosa is left drinking the shawl. 
</P>
<P>
This shawl is the connecting force between the story and the novella, "Rosa." 
Although the novella does not vibrate with the taut power of the story, it 
rounds out the pattern of Rosa's life 30 years later as she tries to resist the 
impact of her daughter's death. Here, too, the language fits the situation -- 
it is immediate and reveals in the first line that Rosa is "a madwoman and 
scavenger." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa resists the label "survivor" that society has applied to her and others 
who got out from concentration camps. "It used to be refugee, but now there was 
no such creature, no more refugees, only survivors, a name like a number . . . 
blue digits on the arm." 
</P>
<P>
She protects herself with many small obsessions. Her life is fragmented -- 
fantasy, memory and reality blending in an ever-shifting pattern. Destructive 
and self-destructive, Rosa isolates herself within a tight circle of habits. 
After demolishing her antique shop back East, she moves into a dingy hotel for 
the elderly in Florida. "The whole peninsula of Florida was weighted down with 
regret. Everyone had left behind a real life." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa's daughter has not stayed for her at the age she died, but has grown, 
taking on a history of her own, a ghost nourished by Rosa's intricate 
fantasies. "Magda, a beautiful young woman of thirty, thirty-one: a doctor 
married to a doctor; large house in Mamaroneck, New York; two medical offices, 
one on the first floor, one in the finished basement." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa's most significant communications lie in the countless letters she writes 
to Magda, who can change from a doctor to a teen-ager to a professor of Greek 
philosophy at Columbia. Her niece, Stella, who sends her monthly checks, keeps 
reminding her that Magda is dead. To avoid conflict, Rosa pretends she believes 
her. This deception forms an even stronger bond between her and the adult 
daughter of her fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
She sees herself as a woman who does not have a life. Her worry about misplaced 
underpants turns into an obsession that blots out the horror of Magda's death, 
a horror always ready to envelop her again if she isn't careful. She begins to 
suspect Simon Persky, a retired man who tries to court her, of stealing the 
pants. The imagined theft leaves her feeling humiliated, anxious as she 
searches for the pants in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
She feels superior to Simon as she recalls the Warsaw of her childhood, her 
privileges and education that set her apart even in the ghetto. "Imagine 
confining us with teeming Mockowiczes and Rabinowiczes and Perskys and 
Finkelsteins, with all their bad-smelling grandfathers and their hordes of 
feeble children . . . we were furious . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When her niece honors her request and sends her Magda's shawl, Rosa feels 
disappointed because it does not "instantly restore Magda, as usually happened 
. . . The shawl had a faint saliva smell, but it was more nearly imagined than 
smelled." Yet, when her daughter finally materializes, she displaces reality, 
taking on more specific traits than most of the live characters. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Ozick's "The Shawl" is brilliant, moving, and chilling as it attempts 
to convey a terror so immense that it overwhelms the characters and renders 
them speechless. To build any language out of this inability to articulate 
seems impossible; yet, Ozick does it in such a way that we, as readers, share 
the characters' powerlessness to give words to their innermost experiences and, 
therefore, are forced to relive them.

It took me the entire length of the opening credits for the CBS series, "The 
People Next Door," to realize that this is garbage destined for the sitcom 
trash can. A half-hour later I was convinced, thanks to the idiotic concept, 
the pathetic script and the infuriating canned laughter at every ridiculous 
line and facial expression. My disbelief at how this rubbish gets on the air is 
only surpassed by my amazement that actual salaries are distributed to the 
so-called writers. Naturally I won't be giving this one a second chance and to 
prevent future abominations, I suggest we all do the same. Until we do, the 
only people laughing will continue to be the writers trotting off to cash their 
checks at the bank.

That "Married . . . With Children" failed to receive a single Emmy nomination 
(let alone award) is a disgrace! Are the academy voters hypocrites, or are they 
just so infused with self-importance that they can't find it in their hearts to 
enjoy and acknowledge mere entertainment? Because that's all "MWC" is -- no 
messages, no social relevance, just vulgar, tasteless low comedy. But brilliant 
low comedy! Fall-on-your-face-from-laughing low comedy! Can't they see that? 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the unwashed masses without reputations to protect, I'd 
like to present everyone connected with "MWC" an honorary award for giving us 
the funniest American situation comedy since "I Love Lucy" went into reruns.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mystic Pizza (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), one of the few genuine hits to emerge last 
year from independent American film making, takes a fairly old idea -- three 
bachelor girls on the loose -- and gives it a patina of freshness by using New 
England coastal city backdrops and casting a delightful archetypal trio: Julia 
Roberts (the reckless beauty), Lili Taylor (the vivacious kook) and Annabeth 
Gish (sensitive and brainy). "Mystic Pizza" refers to the seaside pizzeria 
where they all work; the director, Daniel Petrie Jr., piles on the toppings and 
makes it tasty. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, The Hot Rock (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) is a caper movie with a 
bungling gang led by Robert Redford and George Segal on an inept diamond heist. 
Based on a Donald Westlake novel, adapted by William Goldman and directed by 
Peter Yates, it suggests that someone was thinking of the 1958 Italian caper 
classic, "Big Deal on Madonna Street" -- though they weren't thinking hard 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Invitation to Hell (Channel 9 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is another variation on Faust. 
Made for TV, it was directed by Wes Craven in 1984: the same year he made 
horror history with the first "Nightmare on Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cimino's Year of the Dragon (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a 
controversial revenge thriller about an obsessive cop (Mickey Rourke) battling 
a suave Chinatown drug king (John Lone) through streets running with blood, sex 
and exoticism. Like all of Cimino's work, it's excessive, somewhat delirious 
and visually overwhelming -- and, since Oliver Stone co-wrote the script, the 
dialogue bristles with profanity and wild verbal energy. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ruben's The Stepfather (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., repeated Saturday 
at 8 p.m.), also written by Donald Westlake, has a simple premise: a teen-age 
daughter suspects her bland stepfather of secretly being a maniac -- and she's 
right (as we know from the first scene). What makes "Stepfather" special is 
Westlake's clever construction, Ruben's camera pyrotechnics and a mesmerizing 
performance by Terry O'Quinn as the mild-mannered maniac: a psychotic who wants 
to create a Norman Rockwell world and can't understand why people keep messing 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
In Woody Allen's recent stretch of superb comedies, the 1988 Radio Days 
(Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is sometimes slighted. Yet it's as great as 
anything he's done recently: a reminiscence of his Brooklyn boyhood, told 
through the double-frame of his family's charming foibles and the radio shows 
they all loved (symbol of distant, glamorous Manhattan). It's as 
autobiographical as "Annie Hall," as sweet and fantastic as "The Purple Rose of 
Cairo." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, there's good news and bad news for John Wayne fans. The good news 
is that Sands of Iwo Jima, the 1949 Allan Dwan movie which ranks as one of the 
Duke's paradigmatic war epics, is playing (Channel 11 at 8 p.m.). The bad news 
is that it's apparently been colorized. Wait till next time, pilgrims. 
Meanwhile, The Seduction (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) has Morgan Fairchild as a TV 
newswoman terrorized by a crazed fan: a movie that probably should be 
de-colorized, and maybe even de-filmed. The pick of the evening is probably 
Frank Perry's macabre piece of Hollywood camp, Mommie Dearest (Channel 13 at 8 
p.m.), with Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford -- in a story based on Christina 
Crawford's memoirs -- delivering the kind of no-brakes performance that can 
knock you out and haunt your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Penn's Dead of Winter (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) seems better in 
retrospect. It's a cliched melodrama, with Mary Steenburgen as a bewildered 
actress in a snowbound house, persecuted by crazy people -- but once you 
realize the story is worthless and derivative and going nowhere, you can 
appreciate the grace-notes by the brilliant Penn and by Steenburgen, one of our 
most radiant actresses. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, there's the usual smorgasbord. Under Fire (Channel 9 at 8 p.m.) is 
a good, rock 'em, shock 'em political thriller, done in the best imitation 
Costa-Gavras style by director Roger Spottiswoode, co-writer Ron Shelton ("Bull 
Durham") and actors Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman, as American newsmen caught in 
the caldron of the Nicaraguan revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday: Avenging Angel (Channel 9 at 11 p.m.) is appalling trash 
about an underage hooker who redeems herself by becoming a vigilante. Mary My 
Dearest (Channel 28 at 10 p.m.), a rare 1982 Mexican film, boasts a screenplay 
by no less than Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez; it's directed by Jaime 
Humberto Hermosillo. And Kung Fu: The Movie (Channel 13 at 8 p.m.) recalls more 
weird executive casting choices -- when Bruce Lee was turned down for the 
original martial arts TV series. Here, the producers make amends by casting son 
Brandon Lee as a Manchu assassin on David (Caine) Carradine's trail.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE PLEASURES OF THE PAST: REFLECTIONS IN MODERN BRITISH 
HISTORY BY DAVID CANNADINE (W.W. NORTON &amp; CO.: $19.95; 338 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Benjamin Kilborne 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is quite astonishing to find coherence in a collection of miscellaneous book 
reviews and essays, "not a few of which were pondered and drafted in mid-air" 
as David Cannadine traversed the Atlantic in both directions. Cannadine's 
pieces are eminently readable, well conceived and satisfyingly trenchant. 
Throughout, Cannadine, an Englishman and professor of history at Columbia 
University, follows his own admonition: "The fact that history is difficult, 
demanding and important is no reason for making it dull, or for taking it (or 
its practitioners) too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
A great joy in reading this book is Cannadine's sense for the pithy phrase and 
the succinct characterization. In the section headed "Royalty," readers get a 
"riveting peep" into the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, another at 
George V, who for 17 years "did nothing at all but kill animals and stick in 
stamps." Cannadine describes Lord Mountbatten, who presided over the 
dismantling of the British empire, as an unscrupulous and opportunistic man 
"whose own ideas were rarely good and whose good ideas were rarely his own"; he 
brilliantly finessed the politically touchy job of "closing things down," 
thereby assuring himself a firm place in the larger picture of English history. 
</P>
<P>
In an essay that points out the reactionary political overtones inherent in the 
current nostalgia for English country houses, Cannadine manages to work in the 
story about William Randolph Hearst, who told his wife that St. Donat's castle, 
his recent Welsh purchase, was Norman. "Norman who?" she wondered. In the 
following chapter he takes up Sir Edwin Luytens, architect not only of New 
Delhi (an assignment that prompts Cannadine's phrase "a bird of paradise in a 
chicken run") but also of English country houses. Luyten's houses "brilliantly 
caught (the) elegiac mood" of England early in the century, creating "a 
comforting picture of instant antiquity" not unlike those "beautiful, dreamy 
variations on traditional themes" we hear in the music of that late romantic 
composer, Elgar. In these essays -- most of which are drawn from the New York 
Review of Books and the London Review of Books -- Cannadine may sometimes 
appear breezy or glib. But in each piece he seeks to elucidate historical or 
political problems, and he offers real insight into the current state of 
history and historiography. However clever the phrases, they yet invite serious 
reading. Beneath appearances, Cannadine is thoughtful, stimulating and one of 
those rare historians to give the complexities of history their due. Benjamin

THE GEOGRAPHY OF DESIRE BY ROBERT BOSWELL; (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 320 PP.; 
0-394-57690-X) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera, author of Rites: A Guatemalan Boyhood, is 
currently at work on a contemporary portrait of Guatemala. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I very much wanted to like this ambitious novel by a good writer, whose 
previous fiction has garnered deserving praise. "The Geography of Desire" 
showcases Robert Boswell's virtuosity as a phrasemaker and storyteller, but the 
book's message is unfortunately skewed by a Latin setting too rarefied to be 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to have read "Geography of Desire" in a northern Honduran coastal town 
similar to the one described in the novel, which is set in the backwaters of a 
country like Nicaragua around the mid-'70s. Boswell deliberately blurs his 
coordinates in order to highlight his main theme: the hero's attempt to 
reconcile his polymorphous desires with personal authenticity. The coastal 
resort of La Boca is portrayed as a sultry paradise menaced by the gathering 
revolution. All its residents, adolescents included, speak a stage dialogue 
spotted with epigrams and elliptic phrases. They move in a kind of liquid 
amber, as if they were already living in memory. As a movie, "Geography of 
Desire" would fall somewhere between "Mosquito Coast" and "Night of the 
Iguana." But it has neither the raw, narrative force of Theroux's novel, nor 
the densely textured atmosphere of Tennessee Williams' plays. 
</P>
<P>
Leon, the expatriate protagonist, is served up as a post-modernist homme moyen 
sensuel who seeks redemption by plotting accurately the latitudes and 
longitudes of his desires. In the most stunning scene of the novel, Leon's 
jilted young lover, Lourdes, shouts in despair, 
</P>
<P>
"Is it geography. I've studied the arrangement of the continents, the 
prevailing winds, the ocean currents . . . I can name you the layers of the sky 
. . ." Lourdes then races naked through the jungle, where she rapes her adoring 
childhood admirer, Benjamin. Unappeased, Lourdes spends the night with a 
stranded gringo backpacker. In the morning she beats him unconscious, makes off 
with his clothes and his hunting knife and returns to town to murder her rival, 
beautiful Pilar, whom she baselessly accuses of becoming pregnant to steal Leon 
away from her. 
</P>
<P>
Pilar, a Marxist revolutionary who loves Leon without condition, aspires to a 
small refuge of lucid sensuality between the "abyss of mindless emotion" and 
"the wasteland of heartless intellect." For all her ill-starred attractiveness, 
Boswell's Pilar finally seems as self-consciously invented as Hemingway's 
counterpart in "For Whom the Bell Tolls," who waits for the earth to move when 
she makes love with Robert Jordan. A more successful portrait is that of Leon's 
friend, the storyteller Ramon, who uncovers the miraculous hidden within the 
ordinary. Ramon's gift deserts him when he unleashes the monster of Lourdes' 
jealousy out of a blind obsession with assuring a better future for his son. 
</P>
<P>
The metaphor linking inner and outer geographies is brilliantly conceived, but 
the novel is damagingly divorced from the reality of the world it portrays. Its 
political and social concerns are poorly clothed abstractions, and the 
narrative and dialogue are encrusted with aphorisms that please the ear but 
create a hard, alienating surface. La Boca itself, for all its exotic locale, 
lacks the harsh colors and subtly corrupt atmosphere of Central America's 
Caribbean coast. 
</P>
<P>
In my Honduran counterpart to La Boca, Eros and revolution are similarly wedded 
into the visible and invisible landscape, but conversation centers on the 
depletion of lobster and shrimp stocks in the ocean, and the disappearing 
mahogany forests as the sawmills move ever closer to the coast. The curious 
hammetism of La Boca induces a corresponding detachment in the reader, rather 
than the timeless universality the novel intends. Too many of the secondary 
characters in "Geography of Desire" are pale borrowings from Garcia Marquez and 
other Latin novelists, or manipulated projections of Leon's and the author's 
erotic preoccupation. The gnomic platitudes of the dying revolutionary, Samuel, 
are simply preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
The thicket which traps sounds and shadows from the dinosaur age as well as the 
lovemaking of La Boca's recent ancestors is a deft magic realist touch but it 
serves no illuminating purpose to the main theme. The reappearing terodactyl 
takes on significance only when it casts a shadow larger than that of the 
airplane about to bomb La Boca. Lourdes' crime of passion is the most powerful 
scene in the book, and one the residents of my Honduran village would find 
instantly credible, as they hear or read about similar stories every week. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator's redemption of Leon after a week of bereavement, and his 
emergence from near drowning in the ocean as a resurrected "good man", comes 
across not only as a rigged ending, but as simply irrelevant. What is most 
convincing about Leon is his search for an honest connectedness, a continuity 
of feeling, in the wake of his marital failures. In the end, he is defeated by 
the two-headed beast of his desire which cannot choose between the loving Pilar 
and the volcanic Lourdes, and he proves incapable of loving either one. The 
shapes of Leon's desire cannot fill the larger shapes of his loneliness, and so 
they remain unredeemed. 
</P>
<P>
Lourdes' mother's verdict on Leon may serve this novel equally well: "He 
sincerely desires to be good. That is often the most dangerous kind of person." 
And, she might have added, the most seductive of novelists' footfalls.

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raymond Chandler died in 1959, leaving behind four chapters of a Philip Marlowe 
novel he had tentatively titled "Poodle Springs" (for which read Palm Springs). 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe, married just over three weeks to Linda, a woman he loves very much 
despite her millions, is settling into Palm Springs, looking for a cheap office 
from which to do his private eyeing, and intending to stay his own man, 
financially and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
In the four brisk chapters, Chandler established a lively but foreboding 
dialogue between Marlowe and Linda about her money and confronted Marlowe with 
unfriendly cops, a sleazy nightclub owner who needs his services, and two 
junior-league hoods Marlowe easily outfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Parker, whose own private investigator Spenser is right out of the 
Marlowe tradition, has finished Poodle Springs (Putnam's, $18.95, 288 pp.), 
building on the meager plot hints Chandler left. 
</P>
<P>
The join, as they say, is seamless. On the limited evidence he provided, 
Chandler, in first draft at least, had moved to a faster, sparer style, 
stripped of the fancy verbal footwork -- those razzle-dazzle images -- that 
mark "Farewell My Lovely" and the other Chandler classics. The later style is, 
conveniently, closer to Parker's. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's plot involves hidden identities and convoluted relationships. A 
photographer is not what he seems. There is a large gambling debt at issue, 
plus a couple of murders and assorted pummelings. It's not all hard-edge and 
there are glimpses of heartfelt and doomed associations that are quite 
affecting. 
</P>
<P>
The story floats free in time, probably nearer to Chandler's era than to 
Parker's, but curiously unfixed and abstract. "Poodle Springs" lacks the sense 
Chandler's own works have (and indeed Parker's Spenser novels as well) that 
they place fictional events before a real-as-rust backdrop of present time. 
</P>
<P>
It is a skilled and entertaining work, although the disintegration of the 
marriage (a casualty of stubborn stupidity on both sides) gives those exchanges 
in the book the sour taste of an unventilated room. 
</P>
<P>
James Lee Burke is one of the ablest crime novelists of the day, a remarkable 
combination of poetic sensibility and hard-muscled storyteller. He follows his 
excellent "The Neon Rain" and "Heaven's Prisoners" with Black Cherry Blues 
(Little, Brown, $17.95, 290 pp.), in which ex-cop Dave Robicheaux leaves his 
bayou bait shop, reluctantly, to pursue troubles around the oil rigs and Indian 
reservations of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, a one-time oil worker who lives in Montana when he's not teaching 
writing at Wichita State, builds a terrific story (frame-ups, an undiscovered 
murder, thugs, second-echelon Mafiosi). The plot crackles with events and 
suspense. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Robicheaux's internal states -- his struggles as a recovering alcoholic to 
stay dry, his memories of Vietnam and of the murder of his wife and the death 
of his father, his responsibility to a Salvadoran child he once rescued from a 
plane crash -- are presented with such intensity as to become very nearly a 
parallel novel within the thriller. Burke is not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsley Amis, author of "Lucky Jim" and a literary jack-of-all-trades who has 
tried his hand at almost everything -- science fiction, a James Bond pastiche, 
a crime novel in the period tradition ("The Riverside Villa Murders") -- was 
asked in 1975 to write for a newspaper a mystery serial in six chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The Crime of the Century now appears in book form for the first time 
(Mysterious Press, $16.95, 162 pp.). After the first five installments, readers 
were invited to submit their own solutions. The winner is included in the book, 
right after Amis' own, quite different solution. Amis also contributes a new 
introduction, explaining why this minor five-finger exercise appealed to him. 
</P>
<P>
One of the principals in the story is a mystery writer, sweating over a book 
whose events are rather like the "real" events of the story, to wit, a series 
of schematic murders intended to lead to a major political assassination. The 
suspects are members of a select committee purportedly investigating the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
It is all as calculatedly unreal as mysteries ever get, the plotting so porous 
as to invite those alternate denouements, the whole thing a minor but urbane 
historical curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
After dallying with a series starring an investigative widow and writing a 
couple of very clever straight psychological studies, Simon Brett returns to 
his durable series character, the hard-drinking and generally out-of-work actor 
Charles Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In A Series of Murders (Scribner's, $16.95, 214 pp.), Paris appears to have 
found steady work, playing a dumb village constable in a television series 
featuring a supersleuth who is a kind of down-market Peter Wimsey. 
</P>
<P>
The ingenue in the cast is bashed over the head, the ultimate review of her 
lousy acting; the assistant stage manager is done in on location, evidently for 
knowing more than was good for him. 
</P>
<P>
Between colossal consumptions of Bell's Scotch, Paris deciphers the truth 
(mostly a matter of sweeping aside several red herrings). But the series looks 
to be a disaster, and poor plastered Paris will be a disaster and Paris at 
liberty again. 
</P>
<P>
Paris' drinking gets heavier right along, and has grown counterproductive for 
himself and, I think, the author's intentions. The boozing, for so souffle-like 
a series, has become unattractive, not merely melancholy like Charles' 
inability to reconcile with the wife he loves. 
</P>
<P>
What gives the series its continuing appeal is Brett's eye and ear for the 
world of acting (in any medium). A writer for television in his earlier career, 
Brett knows the posings and the rancors. But Paris by now needs to be a bit 
less of a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, two of the month's detective tales involve murder by ritual 
hangings. In Stephen Murray's The Noose of Time (St. Martin's, $15.95, 159 
pp.), the victim is the newest teacher at a boy's school, an arrogant and not 
widely liked boaster. Suspects include a girl student with whom he's had an 
affair, one or more of his fellow teachers, even his quirky half-sister. Alec 
Stainton, a rather featureless detective inspector, must sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, involving a convenient revelation from the past, is tidy but 
belated, and the writing does not soar much beyond competent. 
</P>
<P>
The hangee of Susan Dunlap's Pious Deception (Villard, $16.95, 209 pp.) is a 
young Catholic priest whose unprincipled bishop hires private eye Kiernan 
O'Shaughnessy to prove he didn't commit suicide, so he can be buried in 
consecrated ground. 
</P>
<P>
There was clearly more to the padre than met the eye, and none of it is 
attractive. As for the bishop, it's hard to believe he ever said his prayers. 
The suspicion presents itself that the author may be settling an old score or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is Phoenix and the mountains nearby, where there are, among other 
items, a shelter for abused women, a weird hideaway home, an enclave of 
rifle-toting rebel Catholics, a shale-oil plant and a site for a mammoth 
retreat-monastery. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of action. O'Shaughnessy gets knocked about a good deal and the 
climactic chase during a mountain cloudburst is fine, sustained action. Yet 
there is something over-cluttered about the plot, a few too many 
cross-purposes, and Dunlap does not yet succeed in making O'Shaughnessy 
appealing as well as tough. 
</P>
<P>
A logo new to me, Brown Bag Mysteries from Council Oak Books, offers an 
interesting and handy format: paperback-sized but hard-covered, like the old 
Everyman classics from college days. 
</P>
<P>
The Mark Twain Murders by Edie Skom (Council Oaks Books, Tulsa, $12.95, 278 
pp.) is a campus novel, set mainly in the library of a university suspiciously 
like Northwestern, where Skom teaches. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Austin is an English teacher who encounters evidence that a gifted 
graduate student may have committed plagiarism, but the girl turns up dead 
before she can confirm or deny. Despite elaborate security measures, it also 
appears that alarming numbers of rare books have been disappearing from the 
shelves and the library. 
</P>
<P>
The deadly doings, including a killer's pursuit of Austin through the dark, 
deserted library, don't seriously dent the author's quite cheerful verve. She 
leaves no doubt of her passionate love of books and libraries, and readers 
similarly impassioned may find "The Mark Twain Murders" leaves them Dewey-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
The body in the library is a genre within the crime genre. There is another 
genre which could be called the lethal fantastic, verging on the preposterous 
and supplied by writers like Richard Condon, Elmore Leonard, Ross Thomas and a 
few others. The select group can now admit, on at least a provisional basis, 
Carl Hiaasen, a columnist for the Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
His third thriller, Skin Tight (Putnam's, $18.95, 320 pp.), sets off with our 
hero dispatching a hit man by puncturing him permanently with a stuffed marlin. 
The hit man had eluded the semitrained barracuda the hero keeps beneath his 
stilted house on the water south of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The book just builds from there, at last embracing, among other delights, a 
plastic surgeon whose hands shake uncontrollably and a hideously ugly killer 
who uses a murderously effective weed-whip as a prosthesis in lieu of his 
missing hand. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom have the losers been so imaginatively done in, seldom have events moved 
quite so fast through a Miami that, in its kaleidoscopic squalor, seems as real 
as a news story. 
</P>
<P>
The hero is Mick Stranahan, who has no wish to be a hero, only to be let alone. 
The plot is not so much a plot as a working out of the thesis that old crimes 
never die, and they don't fade away either.

Why is this Dan standing? 
</P>
<P>
Because he wants to. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable with it," says Dan Rather of his new posture. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of anchoring from the seat of his pants, Dan Rather has 
decided to stand up while he delivers "The CBS Evening News." He thinks the 
three network newscasts look too much alike, and he likes being on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, managing editor as well as anchor of the top-rated newscast, taped a 
few sample stand-up editions last summer and liked the feeling. Word got out 
and Rather was deluged with phone calls from people asking if and when this new 
era would begin. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, from his office in New York, Rather said that if he did start 
standing up, it would be later in the season. "We may or may not do it," he 
said then. "When and if we get to the point that we think it will accomplish 
the things we want it to accomplish, then we might actually do it." 
</P>
<P>
The next night, he did it. What happened? Hurricane Hugo blew Dan Rather out of 
his chair. With the approach of the hurricane, and the need to use maps to 
chart its path, Rather decided it was a good time to start standing. 
</P>
<P>
And he's standing still. 
</P>
<P>
"So far we've had not much feedback at all," Rather said a few days later from 
his office in New York. "What I hear most is 'We didn't know you were 
standing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rather said there were three main reasons why he likes the new stance. "No. 1, 
we can handle graphics in a different way and with a different look. I have a 
gut full of the floating window." By "floating window," he means that little 
superimposed news rectangle over his and every anchor's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Rather said, he felt it was "awkward" when a guest expert or a 
correspondent joined him in the studio to talk about a story. He thinks this 
works more easily if they both stand up. And the third reason, he said, was his 
own comfort; he doesn't like being bolted down by a chair. 
</P>
<P>
Rather wanted to stand up when he took over "The CBS Evening News" from Walter 
Cronkite on March 9, 1981. But Sanford Socolow, then executive producer of the 
broadcast, opposed it. "Sandy was under tremendous pressure not to change 
anything," Rather says. 
</P>
<P>
There was tremendous fear within CBS that the public would go into shock and 
withdrawal when Cronkite left and that nothing should be done to remind them of 
the fact that he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of standing for his first newscast in 1981, Rather did it leaning 
against the desk. Some people referred to it as "squatting." This was deemed a 
flop, so Dan sat down. Ratings dipped for awhile, until another cosmetic touch: 
Rather started wearing sleeveless sweaters under his coat, and the ratings went 
back up. Not to mention sales of sleeveless sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
Will his standing for the news affect his standing in the ratings? Neither 
Rather nor his colleagues seem to think it will. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to change the overall look of the broadcast dramatically or 
radically," Rather says. "But if you don't keep trying new things, you run the 
risk of the broadcast becoming stagnant." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rather has been our most closely watched anchor ever since he started. He's 
the newsman presidential candidates are most likely to pick on and he's been 
the anchor most often in the news himself. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, allegations surfaced that "The CBS Evening News" aired phony 
footage of fighting in Afghanistan between rebels and Soviets during the 
mid-'80s. CBS sources said the footage was shot by a freelance photographer and 
were looking into the charges. Rather himself went to Afghanistan twice to 
report on the Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The report followed by several weeks revelations that ABC News aired fake 
footage that purportedly showed accused spy Felix Bloch accepting a portfolio 
from another agent. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, while Rather was doing in-house tests of his stand-up 
newscast, he tried out a new sign-off on the air. An earlier attempt, 
"Courage," had bombed. But the new one seems to have survived the test of time, 
in this case a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rather now sometimes ends the newscast saying, "And that's part of our world." 
But not always. Sometimes he just says, "And that's tonight's 'CBS Evening 
News.' " The sign-off may fluctuate, but it looks like the new anchor position 
is permanent. Or as permanent as anything gets in television. 
</P>
<P>
No one, in other words, should call it Rather's Last Stand.

MR. CLEAN LIGHTS OUT FOR THE TERRITORY;

EXIT THE RAINMAKER BY JONATHAN COLEMAN; (ATHENEUM: $18.95; 402 PP.)

review.

<P>
In late May, 1982, Jay Carsey, good-looking, upwardly mobile WASP, charismatic 
president of Charles County Community College, highly paid government 
consultant and pillar of Southern Maryland society, took off for 
God-knows-where, leaving behind a series of enigmatic messages to his gorgeous 
wife, admiring colleagues and loyal friends. Though the messages told where the 
keys and the bank accounts were and bore witness that Carsey, ever Mr. Clean, 
was not dropping out of sight on account of any financial monkey business, 
there were no clear indications of why Carsey was leaving everyone in the lurch 
like this. 
</P>
<P>
Graduation was only days away. The college, after the heady expansions of the 
Kennedy-Johnson years, was beginning to experience the contractions of the 
Reagan era. And though Carsey took with him less than $30,000 and left behind a 
fairly substantial estate, he provided his abandoned unemployed wife with no 
clear title and the dreary prospect of pursuing her property through the 
courts. Once the police had eliminated the possibilities of suicide and foul 
play, people were left with no coherent explanation. After all, Jay Carsey -- 
"Uncle Jay" to (it seemed) all of Southern Maryland -- was the one person you 
could always count on. But Carsey's farewell messages were pellucid on a couple 
of points: He had planned this stunt carefully and he had no intention of 
returning or of being found -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
To John Sine, dean of the college and his obvious successor, Carsey left a 
color postcard of Ronald and Nancy Reagan with an inscription that referred to 
the title role Crasey had played in a production that Sine had directed when 
the two first met years earlier: "Exit the Rainmaker. Good luck." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Coleman, who first reported this story for CBS News, is no ordinary 
investigator. With the tenacity of a scientist, the patience of a novelist, and 
the instincts of a hunter, he pursues Jay Carsey's motivation -- through the 
events of his life and the remembrances of his family, friends, and 
acquaintances. (The man had virtually no enemies.) The gradual accretion of 
detail gives you the feeling of watching the restoration of a ruined mosaic. 
Seemingly random tesserae assume their place in the pattern; a detailed 
portrait begins to emerge from the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
About halfway through the book, Coleman actually catches up with Carsey in 
person, only to find that the man himself is no less enigmatic than the 
messages he left behind. Nonetheless, as this antic narrative draws to its 
conclusion, you feel satisfied that Coleman has "got" Carsey -- at least as 
well as one man can ever get another -- that the mystery of Carsey's flight has 
been dispelled, and that you are left only to puzzle about whether Carsey did 
the right or the wrong thing in throwing over his life and loves the way he 
did. Coleman himself refuses to help the reader with this judgement, retaining 
to the last the stance of the clinical observer and never permitting himself 
the dubious joys of the moralist. 
</P>
<P>
How many Jay Carseys are there in America? Very few -- at least among the 
middle class -- would act on their fantasies as he did. But how many are there 
who have such fantasies? Almost everyone, Coleman discovers in his interviews. 
Some fantasists confess their admiration of Carsey openly; others, fearing that 
the thinnest line separates their grueling treadmills of responsibility from 
Carsey's footloose dereliction, rail against him. But in their railing, Coleman 
rightly hears the telltale noises of excessive protestation. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman gets something wrong, I think, and that is his assumption of the 
universality of Carsey's story: "If the life (Carsey) had been living was 
irrevocably American, his decision to light out was far more universal." But 
"lighting out" is a typically American phenomenon -- is, in truth, part and 
parcel of the national literary myth that Leslie Fiedler limned so arrestingly 
in "Love and Death in the American Novel" many moons ago. Even the phrase 
Coleman uses is a (it would seem, unconscious) borrowing from Huck Finn, who 
articulated his intention to "light out for the territory" before Aunt Sally 
could "sivilize" him. 
</P>
<P>
Fiedler also pointed out that the white male's fantasy of flight (preferably in 
the company of a darker-skinned, more elemental male) usually is prompted by a 
castrating female who represents civilization at its most repressive. Who was 
Jay Carsey's Aunt Sally? The answer is not far to find. He had two: his mother 
and his wife. It was his mother who programmed him to be the best, to shine at 
everything. (His father, incidentally, served as the pattern of male inwardness 
and control.) It was his wife who saw to it that all Jay's screws were screwed 
as tight as could be -- in service to her needs and whims and an 
acquisitiveness as cosmic as Imelda Marcos'. Both these women were the objects 
of Carsey's hidden rage, a rage so buried it could only be expressed in flight. 
For Carsey's flight resulted in his mother's heart attack and death and years 
of anguish for his (at last, ex-) wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
But though this story may not have quite the universal ring that Coleman 
ascribes to it (I think it would be incomprehensible in most of the Southern 
Hemisphere and off-putting even in parts of Europe), it is a fascinating 
symbolic statement of the American psyche. In a time when the psychological 
models of Freud, Jung, Lacan et al have been criticized as too culturally 
specific to have universal relevance, "Exit the Rainmaker" points to the need 
for diverse, culturally specific models of the psyche that are not Viennese or 
Swiss or Parisian. It points to a crying need for Americans to reexamine the 
WASP model of psychological health: tough, dry humor, thank you; win at tennis; 
win at business; win at squash; leave the bar clear-eyed, though mind is 
totally drowned by very dry martinis; and no emotion, please. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, "Exit the Rainmaker" points to what may be America's most 
pressing need of all: to reunite its emotional life and its spiritual life in a 
new, integrated whole. The phenomenal sales, during the last decade, of one 
attempt to create such an integration, Scott Peck's "The Road Less Traveled," 
give some indication of how pressing the need is. If the Puritan model, from 
which the WASP caricature has sprung, won't do any longer, what will? (In this 
endeavor of integration the majority culture might at last appropriate from the 
ethnic minorities gifts of more lasting value than the pizza, bagels, and feta 
cheese it already has received so avidly.) 
</P>
<P>
Given the book's importance in explaining us to ourselves, it is a shame it has 
not been better edited. Some judicious pruning would have eliminated needless 
padding and fuzzy circumlocutions. Coleman, who usually sounds like a 
minor-league E.B. White, can occasionally write like a meandering freshman. 
This book, like Coleman's first one, the equally fascinating "At Mother's 
Request," was accepted at Atheneum by Tom Stewart, one of the publishing 
industry's last gentlemen and a great editor. By the time the "Rainmaker" 
manuscript was delivered, Stewart was gone, another casualty in the sad war of 
quality vs. greed that has made Publisher's Row an annex of Movieland. Too bad 
Atheneum didn't care about the book enough to get down to the job of editing 
it.

"A poem should not mean but be." Rita Dove's intriguing "Genetic Expedition" 
(Book Review, Sept. 17) is, but it would have become even more meaningful to 
many readers if you had provided more information about her than just her 
photo. For example, the lines "My child has / her father's hips, his hair / 
like the miller's daughter, combed gold" could be appreciated even more by 
knowing that her German-born husband sports a blond mane. (He is Fred Viehbahn, 
prize-winning novelist and essayist, as well as a guest professor at American 
universities.) 
</P>
<P>
The mention of German bread and radishes for breakfast, as well as the shades 
of Rumpelstiltskin, do echo her immersion in German culture with a 
Fulbright/Hays Fellowship in 1974-75. I know, because I arranged for her visit 
in November 1981 to Cal State University, Fullerton. She lectured in perfect 
German in my advanced literature class and in delightful English to a class on 
American poetry.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: DATELINE SOWETO TRAVELS WITH BLACK SOUTH AFRICAN REPORTERS

In 1986, William Finnegan visited South Africa to profile the black journalists 
working there. His terse account of his travels through the black ghettos and 
sham homelands conveys the reality of life in that strife-ridden country with 
an immediacy that "A Dry White Season" lacks. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting chapters in "Dateline" focus on the paradox of liberal 
South African papers that hire black writers and support the idea of a more 
equitable society, but have no black editors. Finnegan's descriptions of the 
struggle to report the news despite governmental decrees (like Humpty-Dumpty, 
the security forces assert that "subversive" means whatever they choose) and 
the murderous factional struggles within the black community fostered by the 
government, stand as a powerful indictment of the South African regime.

Ethan Mordden is one of the few authors writing about gay life in America to 
reach a general audience. His sure, straightforward prose has such a natural 
tone that he seems just to have jotted down the words and misadventures of his 
friends. Although "I Read My Nephew Stories" was cited in the 1989 National 
Magazine Awards, the strongest stories in this collection are "The Boffer," 
about a man who learns to accept his changed identity when he attends a college 
reunion, and "The Dinner Party," in which one of the best and brightest members 
of the gay community is forced to confront the terrifying reality of AIDS and 
his own mortality. In the final story, the narrator declares that this third 
volume concludes his "tales of gay Manhattan" -- a regrettable decision, as 
these stories comprise some of the best work of this prolific writer of both 
fiction and nonfiction.

ENDPAPERS: INTERNATIONAL PEN GOES TO CANADA

magazine.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the largest and most geographically diverse international meetings of 
writers ever convened ended last week on a high note of cooperation and 
understanding through literature. International PEN president Rene Tavernier 
called this literary global village "one of the most important Congresses in 
the history of PEN." Six hundred writers from all over the world were hosted 
for the 54th International PEN Congress in both Toronto and Montreal, where 
they read from their works, debated literary issues, struggled with problems of 
freedom of expression and confronted painful matters of censorship and 
imprisoned writers. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the positive atmosphere of glasnost, the congress announced the 
reinstatement of a long-dormant Czechoslovakian Center with recognition of 
Czech- and Slovak-language branches, and accepted two new centers from Eastern 
Europe in Ukrainia and Romania. In addition, a task force was organized through 
the Austrian Center to reexamine literature and ideologies in both East and 
West since World War II to recommend important work that had been ignored on 
either side of the Iron Curtain. The Moscow Center and centers from the Baltic 
states worked in cooperation on a resolution protesting "declarations against 
the freedom of speech of the Baltic writers" by various Soviet organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of Iran's death threat to writer Salman Rushdie over his novel "The 
Satanic Verses" still hung over the congress, and Lady Antonia Fraser made an 
impassioned plea for concerned observers to realize that the situation was not 
better. "If anything, life is worse for Rushdie since the new administration in 
Iran has reaffirmed the death threat," she stated. "It is tragic that one of 
our most distinguished PEN members cannot walk where he might be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
A "Recommendation on Tolerance and Fanaticism" adopted by the congress 
specifically addressed the Rushdie case and called upon the Islamic community 
to cease the use of terrorism against writers. International secretary 
Alexander Blokh noted that many victims of this fanaticism are Muslims 
themselves: "There are Islamic writers, even in cities like Paris and London, 
who live in a state of permanent terror." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in recent decades, both the United States and Canada were 
criticized by PEN for freedom-of-expression violations. The U.S. Congress was 
urged to rescind the Helms amendment to the National Endowment for the Arts 
(NEA) appropriations bill which would restrict funding arts projects on the 
basis of content. John Farrell, president of the USA Center West in Los 
Angeles, drew parallels to the Rushdie case, suggesting that the Helms 
Amendment ". . . reflects the pernicious influence of religious 
fundamentalism." The U.S. centers in New York and Los Angeles jointly called 
for a end to the ideological exclusion provisions in the McCarran-Walter Act 
which have been used to refuse visas to writers such as Farley Mowat, Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes because of their political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The PEN Congress unanimously supported a resolution calling on the Canadian 
government to alter a little-known law that allows any individual who requests 
an injunction order against a writer to prevent an unpublished manuscript by 
that writer from being published. This action was taken in response to the 
legal tactics used by the Reichmann family, who are Toronto developers, against 
free-lance writer Elaine Dewar in a $102-million libel suit. Precedents already 
established by this case (which has not yet gone to trial) would have a 
chilling effect on investigative journalism in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Following an extraordinary three-day meeting of the PEN Writers-in-Prison 
Committee, the congress took action on many specific cases in more than two 
dozen countries. Thomas von Vegesack, chairman of the committee, noted that 382 
cases now are being followed, which is the highest number of writers imprisoned 
in the past five years. "It is terrible to think that in the contemporary world 
so many countries are becoming more repressive," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in China has grown dramatically worse since the armed attack on 
the student demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men Square on June 4. According 
to the Writers-in-Prison Committee report, at least 2,000 people have been 
arrested and more than 20 executed. Chinese media have reported that more than 
60 categories of books and publications have been banned, including foreign 
newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is monitoring 36 specific cases, affecting some of China's 
best-known intellectuals. A 38-year-old Chinese poet, Duo Duo, spoke movingly 
to the congress of his decision to live in exile after witnessing the Tian An 
Men Square massacre. "Politics and art are inseparable in China," he said. "In 
a totalitarian society, politics is always a theme for writers -- even when it 
doesn't seem to be." 
</P>
<P>
Other countries with particularly disturbing records for imprisoning writers, 
according to Von Vegesack, include South Korea, where PEN has identified 41 
cases; Vietnam; Nepal; Turkey, where Kurdish writers are regularly arrested; 
South Africa; Romania, which was accused of "cultural genocide against the 
Hungarian, German, and Serbian minorities"; Burma; Israel, and Cuba. The 
situation in several Latin American countries is more tragic, as dozens of 
journalists have been killed because of their writings in countries such as 
Columbia, El Salvador, Peru, and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The charter of International PEN (an acronym for Poets, Essayists and 
Novelists) dedicates the organization to fighting for freedom of expression 
worldwide and to fostering international understanding through literature. The 
latter certainly was accented in Canada, where participants could select from 
more than 50 readings, literary panels and "encounters" with authors. After 
four days of English language in Toronto, the entire congress was transported 
to French-speaking Montreal via an exhilarating train trip on the specially 
chartered "Author Express." 
</P>
<P>
In the literary sessions, one could hear playwright Arthur Miller musing on his 
experience of writing "The Crucible" during the McCarthy Era or watch a film of 
Simone de Beauvoir discussing feminism in America in 1978. Harold Pinter read 
from his plays "The Betrayal" and "Mountain People" with emphatic use of what 
are now known as long "Pinteresque" silences. Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe 
("Anthills of the Savannah") calmly faced down a British journalist who was 
advocating that the children's book "Little Black Sambo" should be banned by 
saying he could not imagine the circumstances under which he would endorse the 
banning of any book. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McMurtry, president of the American Center in New York, could be heard 
frequently on the congress floor speaking eloquently in his role as a delegate. 
Or, late at night in the hotel bar, you could listen to Leo Tolstoy's 
grandniece, Tatyana Tolstoya ("On the Golden Porch") explain that there is such 
a gap between the meanings of words in Russian and in the bureaucratic language 
of Soviet officialdom that the average Moscow citizen would need a very thick 
translation dictionary to understand officials. 
</P>
<P>
A panel on "Universality and Women's Writing" drew a standing-room-only crowd 
to hear Claribel Alegria of El Salvador, Margaret Atwood and Nicole Brossard 
from Canada, and Monika Maron from East Germany engage in heated debate about 
whether women could create literature with the same universal appeal as 
literature written by men. When discussion was opened to the floor, Betty 
Friedan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Alison Lurie and Miriam Tlila from South Africa 
made eloquent statements from the audience. Because the Canadian organizers 
made a point of inviting 50% women among the 60 "honored guests," participants 
took the opportunity to meet and establish a new International Network of Women 
Writers to explore ways of assuring the widest possible audience for literature 
written by women. 
</P>
<P>
A second innovation at the Canadian Congress was the establishment of special 
panels and readings for younger writers whose work is not yet established. "The 
Next Generation" programs featured writers such as Luis Rodriguez from Chicago, 
Mutabaruka from Jamaica, Arturo Arias from Guatemala, Gichora Mwangi from Kenya 
and Alootook Ipellie from Canada. "Although we all came from different cultures 
and had differing degrees of experience, we felt that we had a commonality," 
said Luis Rodriguez. "Each of us was from a segment of society that doesn't 
usually get heard. And it was nice to be heard for a change." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time at an International PEN Congress, the USA Center West from 
Los Angeles was represented by a delegation of 15 writers -- fourth largest at 
the congress -- including official delegates Joanne Leedom-Ackerman and John 
Farrell. The Los Angeles center proposed four resolutions on various issues, 
all of which were adopted.

A TRUDGE DOWN THE AISLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGO KAUFMAN, Margo Kaufman is a contributing editor of this magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHALL WE SHOP?" Duke asks invitingly, as if he's procured two front-row tickets 
to "The Phantom of the Opera" instead of a grocery cart with a wobbly wheel. I 
roll my eyes and trudge through the automatic doors. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike my husband, who actually enjoys supermarket shopping, I consider it to 
be a loathsome chore, only one notch above doing laundry in a Laundromat. When 
I lived alone, I avoided the market at any price -- even if it meant a daily 
run to the 7-Eleven. But Duke, not unreasonably, refuses to live on a diet of 
apples, bagels and Diet Coke. 
</P>
<P>
"It's comforting to make sure that the old larder is provisioned," he says 
cheerfully, as he ambles toward the dairy section. He believes that laying in a 
sufficient supply of produce, pasta, dried fruit, coffee and Japanese soup 
offers subconscious reassurance that you can survive the upcoming week's 
apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you can survive a trip to the supermarket with your mate, you can 
survive anything. Not only must you cope with the usual supermarket 
unpleasantries -- the pungent aroma of a Clorox spill in the meat aisle, 
shopping carts that maneuver as if the shortest distance between two points is 
a figure eight, talking cash registers, screaming babies and the citizen 
sneaking 18 cans of cat food and a bottle of vodka through the express checkout 
line -- you also must cope with your loved one's convictions on everything from 
cottage cheese to garbage bags. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy. "I always think that this is where the relationship is going to 
end," says my friend Leslie. "In the market. Over the toilet paper." A one-ply 
versus two-ply clash? "I want plain, white toilet paper," she says firmly. "No 
scent. No little daisies. The cheapest you can find. After all, where is it 
going? But John wants the most expensive toilet paper. He believes that you 
should buy only the best stuff." 
</P>
<P>
But everyone has his own definition of what the best stuff is. "Not that 
yogurt," Duke chides, when I casually toss a container of Dannon into our cart. 
Don't take it personally, warns an inner voice as my husband puts the container 
back on the shelf and reaches for a brand with a thousand-year-old Bulgarian on 
the label. "This is 5 cents cheaper," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, life is too short to worry about saving 5 cents on a 
tub of yogurt. But Duke is of the 
"those-crooks-will-never-gyp-me-out-of-an-extra-nickel"school of grocery 
shoppers. Still, over the years we have learned to compromise. He no longer 
drags me from market to market in search of the cheapest peach. And I do 
without the designer paper towels that match the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, "people have such personal styles about how they handle grocery 
stores," says my friend Claire, who has at least one supermarket spat a week. 
"I make a general list and systematically start at one end of the store. But 
Fred wants to explore. He's up and down the aisles, reading the backs of boxes. 
He picks food with no regard for what we really eat or have time to cook. It 
drives me nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Not for long. "Fred seems to have a limited attention span," Claire explains. 
"Once he reaches a certain point, no matter what aisle we're on, it's time to 
go. We might have done only two aisles. It doesn't matter. He says, 'Let's grab 
a few things and split.' It takes all the fun out of shopping." 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there is much fun in grocery shopping. My friend Roger agrees. 
"It's hell," he says. "I like to do it like a commando raid: hit and run. I 
don't want to wait around while Fran tries to decide whether to buy Kellogg's 
Corn Flakes or All-Bran. Who cares? It's all grain," he says. "And she gets so 
upset if I buy the frozen food first. What's the big deal? We don't live 180 
miles away. It's not going to defrost." 
</P>
<P>
Roger is convinced that the only solution is to shop alone. "It isn't a good 
event to share," he says. "It's one thing to say, 'Let's go pick out the new 
carpet.' Or 'Let's go buy the baby's furniture.' But 'Let's go to the 
supermarket and bicker about whether we want Granny Smith or Red Delicious'? 
There's no thrill involved." 
</P>
<P>
My friend Sabina would argue with that. "I think marketing is a very loving, 
warm, intimate thing to do together," she says. "With my ex-boyfriends, I 
played soccer with the cantaloupes and threw around the grapes. Obviously, 
those relationships weren't going anywhere. But Anthony and I seriously read 
the labels together. We don't want to buy something that has cottonseed oil in 
it, God forbid!" 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate is a different story. "The other reason I like to shop with Anthony 
is, I try to be so stoical about what I eat," Sabina confesses. "I buy the 
lettuce, the broccoli, the healthy food. But Anthony goes straight to the 
cookies and ice cream. I love having the cookies. And since he put them in the 
cart, I don't have to take responsibility for buying them." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for sharing his cookies, Anthony gets to share her coupons. "I cut 
them out," says Sabina, "but he really loves it when we get to the point where 
you turn them in. So we both get to enjoy the elation of building a financial 
future together by saving money. We leave the market as a team. What more could 
a couple want?"

"Detergent," Duke remembers, just as we're about to reach the front of the 
checkout line. He leaves me with the groceries and bolts down the aisle. My 
blood pressure slowly rises as I empty our cart onto the conveyor belt and 
realize that my husband has disappeared with our checkbook. The shoppers behind 
me are glaring as I politely ask the surly checkout girl with the 5-inch 
fingernails and the pierced nose not to total the bill yet. Just as a brute in 
a sweat suit begins slamming his cart into my ankles, Duke returns. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, honey, I saved 15 cents," he says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
"Get me out of here," I say.

THE JEWELRY DESIGNS THAT ARE MAKING NEWS ARE ONE-OF-A-KIND PIECES OF MINIATURE 
ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Jane Applegate, who writes The Times' Small Business column, 
has studied jewelry design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THEY BEND wire, pound silver, shape gold and set diamonds. Some dig for 
treasure in hardware bins and junk shops. 
</P>
<P>
Others fashion eccentric pieces for clients who demand anonymity. All work in 
isolation, developing styles free of one another's influence. 
</P>
<P>
In converted garages, downtown lofts and back bedrooms, Southern California's 
one-of-a-kind jewelry designers are creating striking and singular pieces that 
are more like artwork than decoration: spear-like brooches that appear to have 
washed up on shore, hand-woven silver bracelets festooned with marbles, 
textured-gold hairpins resembling bridge abutments. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's growing passion for wearable art is reflected in thriving 
galleries, enthusiastic collectors and the crowds that attend exhibits of new 
work. Local jewelers' designs appear regularly on the ears, arms and bodices of 
actresses such as Mary Steenburgen, Carol Kane and Susan Sarandon, according to 
gallery owners. 
</P>
<P>
"They know that I have things that are special," says Jo Wilder, owner of 
Wilder Place on Melrose Avenue, a gallery featuring unique and unusual jewelry. 
"They come here looking for visual candy." 
</P>
<P>
Gallery owners agree that because the best one-of-a-kind jewelry stands as 
miniature sculpture, buying it is an attractive and affordable way to collect 
modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Southern California jewelers worked in the shadow of New York 
and Northwest artists, but that is changing. Consumers with an eagerness to 
embrace new ideas and money to spend have created a thriving demand for unique 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. has found its style, and it's eclectic -- anything goes," says Carol 
Sauvion, owner of Freehand, an innovative West 3rd Street gallery specializing 
in one-of-a-kind arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Selected after interviews with dozens of jewelers, gallery owners and 
collectors, the six jewelers featured here reflect the amazing diversity of 
local talent. Their work ranges from sophisticated, sculptural brooches by 
Valerie Mitchell and Debra Stoner to Yves Kamioner's classic gold-and-diamond 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Between the avant-garde and the classical lie the whimsical marble-and-glass 
beaded bracelets and earrings of Diane Komater; the delicate, symbolic work of 
Melissa Tucker, and the Southwest-flavored creations of Ted Cavagnaro. 
</P>
<P>
DIANE KOMATER 
</P>
<P>
Diane Komater, a pixie-like former painter, shuns both gold and gems. Instead, 
she painstakingly wraps black or silver wire around beads and marbles to create 
bracelets that are a cross between opulent religious objects and '40s kitsch. 
The heavy bracelets bulge with deep-hued beads, some featuring faces or 
abstract swirls. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably have the largest marble collection in the world," says Komater with 
a laugh. The 33-year-old artist works in a tidy garage behind a neighbor's 
apartment building east of the Fairfax area. Komater moved from Berkeley to Los 
Angeles about three years ago. She says she is not influenced by any other 
jewelers and is even reluctant to hire anyone to help her, fearing their ideas 
would spoil her work. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond making the bracelets, earrings and brooches that are now selling well 
enough to pay the bills, Komater dreams of being a fine artist and "creating 
big, wire sculptures." 
</P>
<P>
Lois Lambert, director of Santa Monica's Gallery of Functional Art, which sells 
Komater's work, says Komater's jewelry appeals to all kinds of collectors -- 
"from the young and hip to the conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Komater's bracelets sell for $200; earrings, about $65, at the Gallery of 
Functional Art, 2429 Main St., Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
YVES KAMIONER 
</P>
<P>
Yves Kamioner has perfected a design signature that he calls "the crack." He 
creates fissures in gold and paves the openings with tiny diamonds nestled 
beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The Belgian-born third-generation jeweler recalls peeking out from behind the 
curtains in his family's jewelry shop as a little boy, watching as his father 
bowed to kiss the hands of royal clients. 
</P>
<P>
Kamioner, 33, rarely kisses his clients' hands, but he willingly agrees to 
create anything they wish in precious metals and stones. 
</P>
<P>
"When my client leaves the studio, I know exactly what she has in mind," says 
Kamioner, whose pristine white studio features an illuminated showcase filled 
with his newest work. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has designed 400 pieces for Tiffany and is currently working on a 
line of jewelry for the new Giorgio boutique in Beverly Hills, Kamioner still 
relishes the challenge of one-of-a-kind commissions. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has crafted a $34,000 miniature treasure chest filled with 
precious gems; a $12,000 brooch depicting the Los Angeles skyline in gold and 
diamonds, and a $100,000 gold cane encrusted with diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Kamioner's clients, who buy his work through the Freehand gallery, 8413 West 
3rd St., include the rich and famous, who order elaborate and expensive custom 
pieces, and a local judge who recently commissioned a set of elegant, 
intricately designed wedding bands. 
</P>
<P>
MELISSA TUCKER 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Tucker, 30, a motion picture makeup artist and self-taught jeweler from 
Sydney, Australia, crafts intricate pieces in sterling silver and copper. Many 
pieces feature rabbits (because her parents never let her have one as a pet) 
and fish, which she likes because they are "sleek and sculptural." 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to make no mistake that my work is about making a connection 
with the animals and the earth," Tucker says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to 14-karat gold and sterling silver, Tucker uses accents of 
copper. Because she refuses to use ivory out of respect for elephants, she 
substitutes a type of milky white plastic. For special clients, she creates 
custom-made sculptures festooned with feathers and bits of bone and metal. The 
sculptures, which she started making as gifts for friends, serve as 
eye-catching brooch holders. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who works in a back bedroom in a San Fernando Valley house, says some 
of her work was strongly influenced by a recent trip to Australia, where she 
met aboriginal elders and other representatives of tribal people. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's clients, who include actresses Jodie Foster and Rae Dawn Chong, buy 
her work at Freehand, 8413 West 3rd St., or Wilder Place, 7975 1/2 Melrose 
Ave., both in Los Angeles. Earrings cost $90 to $120, and brooches sell for 
$140 to $165. 
</P>
<P>
VALERIE MITCHELL 
</P>
<P>
IN A downtown loft workshop that's as tidy as a medical research lab, Valerie 
Mitchell creates abstract, avant-garde jewelry that's inspired by architecture 
and sculptural forms as simple as a canoe. Her hair ornaments and brooches are 
reminiscent of bridge abutments, and in a new line of brooches, she fills the 
spaces between metal sections with lightweight cement. One unforgettable 
shoulder decoration resembles a kayak and is titled "Raft." 
</P>
<P>
"I try to apply three-dimensional, sculptural forms to my jewelry," says 
Mitchell, a 34-year-old graduate of the prestigious Rhode Island School of 
Design. "My work also has an artifact quality, like objects that once had a 
usefulness, or things you might find in an old barn." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is an expert at electroforming, a process used to create hollow metal 
shapes that look heavy but feel light. She places a wax form in a chemical bath 
with copper bars, then runs an electrical current through the bath, which 
forces the metal to come off the bars and attach to the wax. The wax melts, 
leaving a copper shell. 
</P>
<P>
For some pieces, Mitchell treats the metal with secret mixes of raw chemicals 
or enamels, creating antique-looking surfaces of henna, ocher and verdigris. 
For others, Mitchell covers sterling silver with 24-karat gold vermeil. 
</P>
<P>
She divides her energy between creating limited-edition pieces for sale in more 
than 100 museums and shops and one-of-a-kind pieces for galleries and private 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Novelists Isabel Allende and Martin Cruz Smith are among admirers who collect 
her work. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's sophisticated designs command a high price, with some brooches 
retailing for $600 or more. They are sold at M Gallery, 8649 Sunset Blvd., and 
Sculpture to Wear, 8441 Melrose Ave., both in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
DEBRA STONER 
</P>
<P>
DEBRA STONER, 31, crafts weathered, dangerous-looking brooches in rusted steel 
and copper and primitive-looking bracelets that look as though they were found 
in an archeological dig. Often she uses ivory, pottery shards or glass she 
picked up on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Stoner, who is an artist-in-residence in the metals department of the Oregon 
School of Arts and Crafts, went against the typical jeweler's evolution from 
working with non-precious metals, such as copper and brass, to gold and silver. 
She received a master's degree from San Diego State University's art 
department, and began her career as a goldsmith and gallery manager in Davis, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I have figured out that I can work in most any material," says Stoner, who is 
going back to her goldsmith roots to design a new line. 
</P>
<P>
"The material is not really the most important thing anymore," she continues. 
"It is the design." 
</P>
<P>
Stoner's top-of-the-line brooches and bracelets, which range in price from $150 
to $240, are sold through the Gallery of Functional Art, 2429 Main St., Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
TED CAVAGNARO 
</P>
<P>
Ted Cavagnaro's silversmithing is reminiscent of the traditional, heavy silver 
jewelry produced by Southwest American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Cavagnaro, 60, of Venice, is a self-taught artisan who adds his own flair to 
the silver that he hammers and forms with tools he makes himself. 
</P>
<P>
His simple, uncontrived belt buckles and hammered silver beads are classic 
examples of the silversmith's craft. 
</P>
<P>
Although his work has a distinct Southwestern flavor, Cavagnaro says he was 
doing Southwestern-style jewelry long before the look became popular. 
</P>
<P>
Cavagnaro fashions his silver pieces by hammering and bending, rarely soldering 
anything together. 
</P>
<P>
"Jewelry making is a series of acquired skills," says Cavagnaro, who spends 
most weekdays working in a tiny annex to his garage. "I am not a skilled 
draftsman or a great artist." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Cavagnaro was a chemical engineer and photographer before he started 
melting silver coins and hammering them into various shapes about 13 years ago. 
Of the hundreds of pieces he's produced, his favorite remains a sensuous strand 
of hand-stamped silver beads that he made years ago and is still reluctant to 
sell. His whimsical potato masher and whisk earrings are perennial favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Cavagnaro's jewelry sells for under $200 and is available from his 
studio at 2241 Prospect Ave., Venice.

Inasmuch as we never fail to blast your socks off when you report erroneously 
regarding spiritual matters, it is only fair to compliment you when you publish 
a balanced piece that does not misstate the facts. 
</P>
<P>
With rare exception, secular media misses the correct interpretation of things 
spiritual. We found that your lead article on Mike Chang did not 
God-and-Christian bash. And for that we want to thank you.

Michael Chang is too humble. How much Jesus Christ helped, I can't say. But I 
do know that hard work, being exposed to some of the best teachers in tennis 
and having a dedicated family willing to share their time and money to further 
his progress deserve some consideration.

ARTFULLY SUITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Artfully Suited," by Mary Rourke (Aug. 27): My trusty calculator 
tells me that it cost $19,436 to dress the nine women you chose to highlight 
women's fall fashions: an average of $2,159.55 per outfit. There is not an 
outfit in there that cannot be duplicated for less than $50 at the Salvation 
Army. I guess those ladies will just have to keep the price tags on to truly 
get their money's worth.

Hip-hop, like disco, is essentially a producer's medium, and it's often more 
accurate to rave about a Matt Dike sound or a Teddy Riley sound than about a 
Tone Loc or a Kool Moe Dee. This year's hot hard-core hip-hop sound comes from 
Dr. Dre, the Compton-bred deejay behind Ruthless Records, which in the last 
several months has released million-selling rap LPs by J.J. Fad, Eazy-E and 
N.W.A. 
</P>
<P>
The D.O.C., a Texas rapper who led the undistinguished electro-hop posse Fila 
Fresh Crew, is Ruthless' newest artist, and Dre has transformed him into 
something of a Compton-style Big Daddy Kane, a guy who plays the English 
language the way Itzhak Perlman plays a Strad. The D.O.C.'s lyrics cut and his 
rhymes are fresh, while his mild voice functions almost as a rat-a-tat 
obbligato that rhythmically supports the groove, swooping in and out of the 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
Though his subject matter tends toward loud boasting, his raps submit 
absolutely to the tyranny of the beat box, which itself supports funky riffs 
lifted from the likes of Parliament and the Sylvers. Label-owner Eazy-E and the 
rest of N.W.A are generous with the cameo appearances we've grown to expect on 
any Ruthless release. JONATHAN GOLD

POP EYE: HAVE BANGLES EXTINGUISHED THEIR FLAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breaking up is hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the Bangles. After weeks of speculation about the band's future, the 
group has finally made it official. After nine years together, two platinum 
albums and a ton of critical plaudits, L.A.'s most acclaimed all-gal band is 
going on hiatus, perhaps permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't seem very happy anymore," said Susanna Hoffs, the group's lead 
singer. "The last few years were very emotionally draining. After nine years, 
we'd given so much to each other that it had become like a marriage -- a long 
marriage. It got to the point where we just didn't have that 'band' feeling 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hoffs, the band held a meeting nearly three weeks ago where it was 
agreed that everyone -- Hoffs, bassist Michael Steele, guitarist Vicki Peterson 
and drummer Debbie Peterson -- would go their separate ways, at least for the 
foreseeable future. (The band's last public performance was Sept. 2 at the 
Redwood Amphitheatre in Santa Clara.) 
</P>
<P>
The group has enjoyed continued success -- its most recent album, "Everything," 
sold 1.2 million copies and produced the No. 1 hit single, "Eternal Flame." But 
it became obvious that their greatest strength -- all four women in the group 
write and sing -- had also created the most trauma and tension. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our last album, but it was really painful to make," Hoffs said. 
"It ended up being like the Beatles' White Album, where we were essentially 
serving as each other's back-up band. Everyone felt compromised -- it's just 
hard to do artistic things by committee. We called it 'song abortion.' We had a 
quota system, where everyone had to be represented on the final song list. 
That's why we ended up with 13 songs on the record. It just wasn't working -- 
there was so much suffering and loss that everyone felt they were being 
cheated. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where everything had a quota. Even our video directors 
were told that everyone in the band had to have equal time in the videos. 
Trying to have four songwriters and singers in a band causes a lot of tension, 
largely because we were so afraid of hurting each others feelings that we never 
got our feelings out -- we were too busy protecting each other." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, much of the band's problems were caused by Hoffs' high profile. 
As the band member featured on the most hit songs -- and most favored by 
photographers and video directors -- she became the group's media darling and 
focus of fan appeal. "Sure, it made it difficult," said Vicki Peterson. "Here 
we felt we were a band with four equal parts, but people were always looking at 
our last single and saying, 'Oh, Susanna sang it, so she must be the leader of 
the band.' I think that caused some tension -- it certainly took some of the 
satisfaction out of it for me." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffs agreed: "It gave me a lot of anxiety and emotional stress. It ended up 
taking away from my pleasure that people liked what I was doing because that 
was causing so much pain and frustration to everyone else in the group." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed. "Maybe this all happened because we were women. Maybe if we were 
guys, we would've yelled at each other and fought it out and gotten over it. 
But we all tried to be so supportive that we ended up being martyrs!" 
</P>
<P>
For now, Hoffs says she's writing songs with various partners, with plans to 
"eventually" put together a solo album. Peterson says she's taking some time 
off before pursuing other interests. (According to the band's management, 
Stiefel-Phillips Entertainment, the group is signed, collectively and 
individually, to CBS Records.) 
</P>
<P>
Will the band ever get back together? Peterson is optimistic: "We needed this 
break to survive -- I believe there'll be another Bangles album." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffs isn't so sure: "If the emotional scars heal and we have a genuine musical 
reason to get together, then maybe it could happen. But only if we all can feel 
a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
And what are the group's commercial prospects as solo artists? "What made the 
Bangles great was their signature harmony sound," said ex-A&amp;R exec Peter 
Philbin, the key figure in signing the band to CBS Records. "When you turned on 
the radio, even in the middle of a song, you immediately knew who it was. I 
think each of the members will have success on their own, but it's important to 
realize that they can't trade on what made the Bangles special. They weren't 
the greatest musicians in the world, but they were a real band. They had an 
all-for-one, one-for-all attitude -- and that's what they'll really miss."

The most telling title on Byrne's first conventional (at least by Byrne 
standards) solo album is "Don't Want to Be Part of Your World." The song's call 
for retreat from the everyday horrors of our world -- reminiscent of Steely 
Dan's claim that "any world that I'm welcome to is better than the one I come 
from" -- is perhaps an explanation for his decade-long musical trek through 
Third World cultures. 
</P>
<P>
But where the Dan's song was a weary, cynical loner's credo, Byrne's develops 
into an expansive dreamer's plea that is downright sweet: He does want to be 
part of the world; he just wants it to be a nice place. Thus, the album is 
populated with dreamers and escapists, as if Byrne is bringing them together 
into a new family of man, just as he has symbolically brought together 
different musical cultures throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, his use of Latin American music and musicians on this album is 
almost incidental, and the overall impression is not much different from last 
year's Talking Heads album "Naked," which utilized similarly infectious zouk 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't to say the music is incidental: The bubbly sambas, merengues and 
other Latin styles are as attractive, accomplished and, indeed, sexy as 
anything Byrne has ever done, and the collaborations with such Latin greats as 
Willie Colon are vibrant and colorful. But this is not a South American album 
any more than Paul Simon's "Graceland" was a South African album. It's a David 
Byrne project through and through, with all the usual superlatives applicable.

ART NEWS: MAJOR EXHIBITIONS OF 17-CENTURY MASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two major exhibitions of the works of great 17th-Century painters -- Diego 
Velazquez and Frans Hals -- have opened in New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Velazquez," an unprecedented exhibition of more than 35 paintings by the great 
Spanish painter, is on view at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art until Jan. 
7; and "Frans Hals," the first major exhibition of paintings by the great 
portrait painter to be held outside of the Netherlands, is at Washington's 
National Gallery of Art until Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
For the Velazquez exhibition, the Museo del Prado in Madrid is lending 17 major 
paintings -- the first time the museum has done so for an exhibition outside 
Spain. Also included in the exhibition are paintings from museums in England, 
Scotland, Austria and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Said Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum: "The very 
notion of a Velazquez exhibition is one that most of us have always dismissed 
as belonging to the realm of unrealizable dreams, so great and rare a painter 
is he. At least half of his paintings are in the Prado, and in the few other 
collections where they appear, they are so highly valued that their loan is 
seldom seriously envisaged." 
</P>
<P>
As Velazquez painted about 90 pictures in his 40-year career, the exhibition 
will include close to half of his works. On view will be major examples of his 
genre, religious and mythological scenes; examples of his court jester series, 
and his portraits of the royal court and court officials. Included are five 
portraits of Philip IV, along with portraits of Queen Mariana of Austria, 
Prince Baltasar Carlos and infants Maria Teresa and Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
The Hals exhibition also contains works from many great international museums. 
The traveling show is organized by the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 
association with the National Gallery and the Netherlands' Halsmuseum, Haarlem. 
The National Gallery is the exhibition's first venue, and the only one in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Included are more than 60 paintings and small oil sketches drawn from all 
phases of Hals' remarkable career. Examples of all facets of his work will be 
shown, including his earliest known painting, a portrait of "Jacobius Zaffius" 
(1611), genre scenes (including "Merry Drinker"), family portraits, and his 
remarkable regent portraits, such as portraits of the regents of the Old Men's 
Alms House in Haarlem. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most significant exhibition of Hals' work ever shown in the United 
States," said J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art. "It 
will offer visitors the opportunity to see the full range of his genius, 
including the development of the bold and innovative techniques for which he is 
so well-known." 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: More than 150 contemporary and vintage photographs go on the blocks 
Tuesday at the Fourth Annual Photography Auction, a benefit for the Los Angeles

CHECK OUT B-52S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Steve Hochman's review (Record Rack, Sept. 24) of the Sugarcubes 
latest album, may I suggest he listen to the B-52s for the "mischievous" 
quality he seeks? 
</P>
<P>
It still amazes me that no one has heard this obvious rip-off of a sound 
created right here in the U.S.A. Good music doesn't have to come from an 
exotic-sounding place like: Reykjavik to be "brand-spanking new."

UNFAIR TO COMMUNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jules Feiffer's depiction of the aging communist of the '30s (Sept. 24) 
couldn't be more unfair. Most people who joined the Communist Party ended their 
membership when they were able to divine the villainy of Stalin. Some stayed 
with the resolve to improve their party. I am aware of none who have concealed 
from their consciences the many ugly realities of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
To those types of Depression-era communists, the right-headedness of Gorbachev 
is certainly no embarrassment. Given their disillusionment, their dedication to 
progress and the persecution they have suffered in this country, it should be 
of surprise to no one that they may look upon his actions with a certain amount 
of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Jules Feiffer is a rather admirable fellow himself, not to mention 
creative and intelligent. It's entirely possible that the grumpy old man in his 
cartoon is not the run-of-the-mine American Red at all, but rather the breed 
apart: that sanctimonious coward who will call himself by whatever name is 
fashionable at the time.

BRITISH GET MOST OF THE THEATER MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Dan Sullivan's article ("A Birthday Wish for Music Center," Sept. 17) 
calling for a classical theater company to be finally formed at the Music 
Center, sure why not? But to then advocate a director with strong classical 
credentials "which therefore may suggest a Brit," only undermines his exciting 
proposal and shows a total misunderstanding of where the American theater is 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly our biggest problem in the area of classical theater still seems to be an 
incredible inferiority complex. Even our own theater producers and professional 
practitioners (not to even mention critics) find it hard to believe what 
training, exposure to foreign works and just sheer hard work has accomplished 
in the last 25 years in this country. Instead, we just keep on handing the ball 
over to the Brits every time we can, assuming no American directors have the 
proper cultural "genes" to be first-rate with the classics. 
</P>
<P>
In our own back yard alone, Jack O'Brian of the Old Globe, Des McAnuff of La 
Jolla, Dan Sullivan (our critic's namesake in Seattle) and Adrian Hall have 
gained world-class distinction as classical directors, and its time they were 
recognized as such by our own L.A. critic. 
</P>
<P>
Since time and time again American money has gone to support the Royal 
Shakespeare Co. and the BBC Shakespeare series, no wonder we can't raise enough 
interest and money to produce our own classical projects like the one Sullivan 
proposes.

ABOUT THAT WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would someone care to explain to the foreigners east of California Movieland's 
eternal love affair with the F-word? We who have grown tired and bored with "F" 
wonder why Hollywood is still so titillated by "F." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I overheard a man who was renting a movie video ask the clerk what 
the "F" rating was. He claimed he found "F" annoying and that it destroyed his 
enjoyment of a movie when he had to continually wade mentally though the "F's" 
to catch the rest of the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Add a rating . . . G, PG, PG-13, R, X, and "F" (thank you very much). Join the 
real world and get bored with "F."

BUILDING DOLL HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINIATURES ARE fascinating -- we stare in rapture at teeny sofas, tiny beds and 
itty-bitsy plates when we wouldn't even notice their life-size counterparts. 
We're completely enchanted by a 4-inch pipe organ that really plays or 1-inch 
boots that lace up. We marvel at little staircases and wee ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Miniatures are a huge business these days, and almost every miniature is 
related to a doll house. Victorian or modern, cottage or mansion, bakery or 
stable, doll houses are still special gifts for little girls, but they are also 
compelling hobbies for adults. 
</P>
<P>
Although some people buy everything for the well-furnished doll house, most 
feel that they have to make something -- maybe the house itself, or the 
curtains. One doll-house book author made ceramic dishes and shaped and welded 
a set of copper pots for the kitchen. But nothing equals the amazing doll house 
owned by former silent-film star Colleen Moore that is on display at Chicago's 
Museum of Science and Industry. Moore commissioned Hollywood set designers and 
miniaturists to craft the fairy-tale castle and its furniture; two chairs were 
made using Moore's diamond-and-emerald jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Perfectly fine doll houses can be made from shoe boxes and orange crates, 
although most of us might prefer a three-story brownstone or antebellum 
plantation. Once the shell is made or bought, the fun begins: decorating. Doll 
house aficionados today can choose from hundreds of items, in stores and 
mail-order catalogues: hardwood floors, Art Nouveau wallpaper, itty-bitty 
bathtubs and mini-magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in miniature construction are available at Lilliput's in Torrance, 
which also has all sorts of supplies (such as lighting, tiny books, gardening 
tools, landscaping items, brickwork and holiday decor). Angela's Miniature 
World in Camarillo offers classes for various projects (such as complete house 
building, making miniature food and doing electrical wiring) and also has a 
full line of supplies and kits. Accent on Miniatures in Laguna Hills has no 
formal classes, but the owner, Barbara Gregory, will "work with customers one 
on one" if they need assistance; it also has all necessary supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying supplies are The Doll &amp; Miniature Shoppe , and Miniature Estates, 
both in Los Angeles in Los Angeles; Casey's Wee Littles in Anaheim, and Tiny 
Town in Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutshell News magazine, published monthly by Kalmbach Publishing Co., 21027 
Crossroads Circle, P.O. Box 1612, Waukesha, Wis. 53187, includes how-to 
instructions and features many doll-house projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Dover Publications Inc. has issued several books specializing in doll houses: 
"Needlework Designs for Miniature Projects," by Eileen Folk; "Miniature Iron-On 
Transfer Patterns for Dollhouses, Dolls and Small Projects," by Rita Weiss and 
Frank Fontana; "Build Your Own Inexpensive Dollhouse," by E.J. Tangerman, and 
"Ready-to-Use Dollhouse Floor Coverings," "Ready-to-Use Victorian Dollhouse 
Wallpaper" and "Ready-to-Use Art Nouveau Dollhouse Wallpaper," all by Muncie 
Hendler. For a catalogue write, 31 E. 2nd St., Mineola, N.Y. 11501.

SEVRES PORCELAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THIS FAMOUS decorative china, created by the national porcelain factory of 
France and still made today, was first produced in 1738. Throughout its long 
history, Sevres, named for the longtime location of the factory, has been 
formal, elegant, sophisticated and almost unashamedly high style. It is royal 
ware, with the crossed "L" cipher of Louis XV as its mark. A characteristic 
example is the 744-piece dinner service made for Catherine the Great of Russia 
in 1779: elaborate scenes and sumptuous decorations on a background of bleu 
celeste. 
</P>
<P>
The first pieces, made at Chateau de Vincennes before Louis XV moved the works 
to Sevres, often bore Oriental or Rococo decorations in the Meissen style. But 
the graceful forms and soft colorings were distinctively French. During its 
finest period (1750-1770), characteristic colors included gros bleu, turquoise, 
yellow and rose Pompadour, set off by rich gilding, framed paintings of birds, 
landscapes and figures in the manner of Boucher. 
</P>
<P>
After hard-paste porcelain was introduced in 1769, the ware became lighter and 
more delicate. Its imitations of Chinese Ming Dynasty eggshell porcelain were 
shown to the world at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Standards were 
high, and among the artists employed by the company over the years was the 
famous sculptor Auguste Rodin. Well into the 20th Century, Sevres has regularly 
used the talents of fine contemporary artists. 
</P>
<P>
The factory is now located in the Paris suburb of St. Cloud. Recent examples 
sold at auction range from a bottles and stoppers decorated with portraits of 
Louis XIV and Princess de Lamballe to other pieces featuring one of Madame de 
Pompadour's spaniels, symbolizing fidelity, and female figures in the Art Deco 
style. The factory has produced almost everything that can be created in 
porcelain: dinner services and tea services, commemorative bowls and vases and 
cachepots, busts and small statuaries. 
</P>
<P>
Imitations of Sevres are common, but it is well to remember that 18th-Century 
colors are softer than those found today. Rose Pompadour, for example, is 
almost grayish in contrast to a shocking pink of the 1860s. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Sevres porcelain at La Maison Francaise in Los Angeles; Richard Gould 
Antiques in Santa Monica; Speidel Antiques in Pacific Palisades ; Design Center 
Antiques in Pasadena; Snooty Fox Antiques in Ventura; Roberta Gauthey Antiques 
and Richard Yeakel Antiques in Laguna Beach, and San Diego Fine Arts in San 
Diego.

ICE SKATING AND HOCKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANEY MILSTEAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AS INDIAN SUMMER lingers on, the thought of an icy respite need not be merely a 
pleasant reverie. There are enough ice rinks in the area to make this cool 
daydream a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Says Craig Yeaton, one of the managers of the Pasadena Ice Skating Center: 
"We're getting more and more born-again skaters, people who left their skates 
home when they moved West and then changed their minds." In putting skating 
back on its feet, Yeaton credits the success of the Los Angeles Kings and the 
addition of Wayne Gretsky and others to the hockey team. He also gives a nod to 
the year-round television coverage of competition skating. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is causing the boom, it's creating a holiday on ice for a 
traditionally up-and-down industry. At Pasadena Ice Skating Center, there is a 
waiting list of more than 100 hopefuls in line for a hockey league opening. 
Also available at the rink are public skating sessions, skate rentals, figure 
skating clubs and lessons and lunch-bunch skating for mid-day blade runners, a 
weekly bargain Cheapskate night, plus several rental options for skating 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Ice Rink consultant Michael Kirby, whose history with skating began 
when he was ice star Sonja Heine's partner from 1947 to 1951, has come out of 
retirement because skating is so popular again. "I've always fought against the 
concept that skating is an art and not a sport -- it's both -- and that it's a 
winter pastime," Kirby stated. "People are now realizing that it's an activity 
you can participate in all year long." 
</P>
<P>
Our association between skating and the outdoors, hence the connection with the 
winter months, is a natural one. At the Blue Jay Ice Castle, located a mile 
from Lake Arrowhead (on the south side), communion with nature can be enjoyed 
for all of the 12 months. The rink is open on three sides onto woods that are 
green in summer and white in the winter. Although it remains unheated in even 
the most brisk of temperatures, the rink has a cozy lobby complete with a 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ice Capade's Chalet rink locations in Costa Mesa the rink is equipped 
for hockey (which requires Plexiglas protectors or safety netting). This outlet 
also is a hot spot for broom ball. A variation of what is called street hockey 
in some snowy U.S. climates, this game is played on rough ice and in tennis 
shoes, not skates. As its name implies, the game involves the batting about of 
a ball via brooms. 
</P>
<P>
Where price is concerned, a good skate can be rented for less than the price of 
a first-run movie. If you prefer to own rather than rent, a good pair of skates 
with detachable blades can be purchased for between $100 and $125. Prices can 
soar, of course, but also drop to the $60-$70 range for old-style 
non-convertible skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional ice arenas in Southern California include the Culver City Ice Rink 
(home of the Los Angeles . Kings' practice sessions) and the veteran Pickwick 
Ice Arena in Burbank. Other Ice Capade's Chalet outlets are open for business 
in Rolling Hills Estates (also known as the Palos Verdes outlet), Palm Desert, 
La Jolla and North Hollywood.

THE BOOK OF POTPOURRI BY PENNY BLACK (SIMON AND SCHUSTER; 1989) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Thornburg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sumptuously photographed "The Book of Potpourri" takes the reader from the 
first step of gathering flowers through drying techniques to explaining effects 
of drying on different types of plant materials. Penny Black offers more than 
40 recipes for varying scents and visual effects as well as myriad ideas for 
displaying the fragrant petals. Included are "chintzy mixes with floral 
fragrances; pretty herb potpourris, smelling of lemon or mint; rich, moist 
mixes; traditional damask rose bowls of rich blooms." 
</P>
<P>
According to Black, potpourri originally was a culinary term meaning a stockpot 
of mixed vegetables and meat. By the middle of the 18th Century, the word came 
into common usage and meant "a mixture of scented plant materials that were 
used to perfume the home." The traditional potpourri contained five groups of 
ingredients: scented flowers and petals, or wood, roots and barks; herbs; 
spices; fixatives, and essential oils. Modern potpourri has the same 
ingredients as that of yesteryear, although vegetable rather than animal 
fixatives are used today. 
</P>
<P>
Black shows how each potpourri can be made by using one of two methods: the dry 
method or the moist method. The former, by far the simplest, is finished as 
soon as the dried materials have been mixed together. The moist potpourri, more 
time-consuming to create, requires dried fragrant petals and flowers to be 
cured with natural salt, brown sugar or brandy before mixing them with the 
other ingredients. The dry potpourri offers the prettier appearance, while the 
moist one, usually kept covered, retains the benefit of being more highly 
scented. 
</P>
<P>
She offers creative ideas including "storing soaps in pretty glass jars, so 
they absorb the fragance; placing special mixes in small muslin bags to perfume 
the bath water; to packing writing paper, cards and drawer liners between 
layers of potpourri to absorb and become perfumed." Also included is an 
invaluable photographic catalogue of the flowers, leaves, roots, seed, herbs, 
spices, fruits, fixatives and essential oils that can be used in potpourri, 
with explanations of their varying effects on the scent and appearance of the 
final mixture. A helpful glossary of retail and mail-order suppliers is listed 
so that the reader can purchase essences, fixatives, dried flowers and other 
potpourri ingredients. ($19.95) Barbara Thornburg

A TIMES POLL CONFIRMS THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS ARE INDEED DEVOTED TO GOOD 
HEALTH AND NOT JUST TO IMPROVING THEIR LOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

science.

<TEXT>
<P>
Americans have become remarkably health conscious. According to a Los Angeles 
Times Poll, they are exercising and reading the labels of food packages. They 
are cutting down on sugar, alcohol and, especially, red meat. They are eating 
more vegetables and drinking more water. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is pursuing virtue at the dinner table or in a health club, but 
many Americans, especially women, say good health is what they want most out of 
life. And, increasingly, they are willing to make sacrifices to get what they 
want. 
</P>
<P>
Given only one choice, the survey asked, what is the most important thing in 
life: to be creative, famous, powerful, wealthy, healthy? 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,583 Americans interviewed, only 1% wanted power, 5% wealth, 6% 
creativity, 8% success; 10% wanted a happy marriage, 16% wanted to help others. 
But a striking 50% of all adults -- 43% of men and 55% of women -- said they 
wanted health and a long life above all else, confirming the popular adage, "If 
you have your health, you have everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, conducted its survey of good health by 
telephone during this past summer. On a survey of this size and complexity, the 
margin of error is estimated to be 2 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently spurred by growing publicity about the virtues of exercise, the 
majority of American adults -- 53% of women and 60% of men -- say that they 
exercise regularly. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they had in fact exercised the week before, however, an 
overwhelming majority -- 90% of men and 85% of women -- said they had engaged 
in some kind of physical activity or sport in recent days, suggesting that 
almost all Americans exercise sporadically, even if they don't work out 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular form of activity was walking (39%), followed by swimming 
(15%), bicycling (8%) and jogging (7%). 
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly," Lewis says, "the poll also shows that people who were 
well-to-do and single were more likely than others to exercise. For reasons 
that aren't immediately apparent, liberals and conservatives are more likely 
than middle-of-the-roaders to be involved in exercise. And Republicans are also 
somewhat more likely than Democrats to be frequent exercisers . . . confirming 
the notion that exercise is an an upscale occupation." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians, who by reputation wrote the primer on good looks and 
healthy life styles, are, in fact, more likely to exercise than are people 
living in any other part of the country. While more than half of all Americans 
said they exercise regularly, nearly two-thirds of Californians said they are 
habitual exercisers. 
</P>
<P>
New Englanders are also frequent exercisers, The Times Poll found, but, 
according to a survey released last summer by the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control, New Yorkers are the most sedentary of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Weather does not seem to explain fully the higher exercises rate in Southern 
California, according to The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Even though most Americans say they exercise outdoors at least part of the 
time, inclement weather does not seem to deter them from their activities. Only 
about one of four people outside Southern California complained that it was 
sometimes too hot or too cold to exercise, and nearly one of five Southern 
Californians says he or she faced similar difficulties, despite the general 
perception that the weather is nearly always mild in their part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, Californians are not as hedonistic or vain as the 
rest of the country would like to believe. They are less likely than other 
Americans to exercise simply to improve their looks, and they are somewhat more 
likely to exercise for better health, although the majority of all Americans 
say their primary reason for exercising is to make themselves healthier. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are also more likely than other Americans to be injured at sports; 
they spend slightly more money on buying equipment and paying health-club dues 
to make themselves healthier and they are more determined than other Americans 
to choose vacation spots where it is possible to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
While Americans seem to be exercising more than they used to do, they are not 
exercising nearly as much as doctors believe they should to keep their bodies 
trim and to keep their internal organs, such as their hearts and lungs, fit. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 8% of adult Americans are getting as much exercise as the 
now-standard government recommendation for the level and type of exercise 
desirable for good health, according to surveys released this summer by the 
Centers for Disease Control. Basically that recommendation is that healthy 
adults should spend 15 to 25 minutes a day, three to four days a week, doing 
some form of exercise vigorous enough to elevate breathing and heart rates but 
not so vigorous that it becomes impossible to talk comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CDC studies, another 34% of American adults were "regularly 
active," that is they walked or did some other kind of physical activity at 
least three times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes a session but at levels of 
intensity below those now recommended. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll shows that the typical American reported spending 6.3 hours a 
week on strenuous exercise, considerably higher than the CDC estimates suggest. 
The discrepancy between these and other surveys may in part be due to what has 
been found in studies at USC and elsewhere: some people, particularly highly 
competitive, compulsive Type A personalities, tend to overestimate the time 
they spend exercising. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing exercise, to one person, might mean running for 40 minutes. To another, 
it might mean stooping and bending or touching the toes 10 times a day," says 
Gregory Heath, a CDC epidemiologist and exercise physiologist. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas The Times Poll allowed people to define for themselves what it means to 
"exercise regularly" and what is meant by "strenuous exercise," the CDC surveys 
asked very precise, detailed questions and applied rigorous definitions to 
those answers. The end result is that people probably are not exercising quite 
as much as they think they are, Heath says. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Heath adds, it is "quite true" that health consciousness is on the 
rise -- at least in some parts of the country and among some socio-economic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of many factors, partly just life style . . . the likelihood that 
people are exercising in Los Angeles is much greater than it is in Dubuque, 
Iowa," Heath says. 
</P>
<P>
Women and the elderly seem to be exercising a good deal more than they once 
did, whereas blue-collar workers are exercising less, the government surveys 
show. Whether it is working on the docks unloading ships or collecting trash, 
many low-paying, manual jobs are becoming increasingly automated so that 
blue-collar workers are expending less physical energy at work. At the same 
time, Heath says, the people who hold such jobs do not seem to be nearly as 
attracted to leisure-time exercise activities as are better-educated, more 
well-to-do Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Yet exercise is not the most important step people say they have taken during 
the past year to improve their health. Going on a diet was cited as the most 
significant action taken by nearly a third of those interviewed by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pronouncements from the fashion world that well-muscled, voluptuous 
bodies are now in style, most Americans seem to think that thin is in. As a 
result, twice as many women think they are overweight as really are. While 48% 
of women say they are too heavy, only 25% actually are, according to a formula 
for proper weight devised by the CDC. Men, on the other hand, are somewhat less 
likely to be overweight and they are also less likely to think they weigh too 
much. While 39% say they weigh more than they should, 22% really are 
overweight, according to the CDC scale. 
</P>
<P>
(People who are underweight, for the most part, think they are the proper 
weight. And almost everyone who is overweight knows he or she is overweight.) 
</P>
<P>
While many Americans think they need to diet, giving up food may be the most 
difficult of all steps for people to take in their quest for better health. 
Although only one in five Americans says it is hard to exercise and one in four 
says it is difficult to quit smoking, one in three says that it is hardest to 
cut down on food. It is hard for both men and women, although women do have a 
somewhat tougher time dieting, as they have a somewhat tougher time exercising 
than men do. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, one in five men and one in three of women say they 
are now on a diet, although the vast majority -- 96% of the men and 82% of the 
women -- have never used commercial diets such as Weight Watchers or 
NutriSystems. 
</P>
<P>
Sweets are by far the biggest temptation for American adults. Two out of three 
pick ice cream, cake, chocolate, candy, cookies or doughnuts as the food they 
have the most trouble resisting. Pizza comes in a distant second, with 8% 
reporting this delicacy as their Achilles heel. 
</P>
<P>
While they may like foods that are not terribly good for them, Americans, and 
especially Californians, are now mindful enough of what they eat that they have 
taken to reading the labels of food products. About 59% of Southern 
Californians and 50% of people elsewhere say they now routinely look at labels 
before making purchases. Many report that they have given up or cut down on 
some foods: 23% say they eat less red meat; 19% say they drink less beer, wine 
or hard liquor; 12% say they consume less sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, many people claim to be eating more of some healthful foods. Water 
and vegetables, for example, top the list of consumables that are on the rise 
in popularity. According to The Times Poll, 21% of Americans are drinking more 
water today than they did five years; 21% are eating more vegetables; 15% are 
eating more fruits. Fish, poultry and diet drinks are also on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, relatively few people reported consuming much in the way of liquor. Of 
those surveyed, 69% of women and 46% of men say they don't drink at all. The 
majority of people who do drink consume relatively little -- less than a glass 
of wine, beer or one drink of hard liquor a day. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking is a habit that virtually everyone said they want to give up. Yet 23% 
of women and 9% of men have never even gone one day without a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Stress is one of the factors, along with improper diet and inadequate exercise, 
that is thought to contribute to heart disease and other health problems. Two 
of three Americans say they regularly experience stress and one of three 
reports having a great deal of stress. Women are more likely than men to find 
stress in their lives. And Californians are quite a bit less likely than other 
Americans to lead stressful lives. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 stress reliever in American is to do nothing. One of three says he or 
she does not do anything in particular to relieve stress. The second most 
popular remedy is exercise, used as a stress-reducer by 17% of the population 
as a whole and 20% of Californians.

BEHAVIOR THAT USED TO BE CONSIDERED UNETHICAL OR IMMORAL IS NOW OFTEN BLAMED ON 
ILLNESS AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. WHAT'S THE LINE BETWEEN BEING WRONG AND BEING 
ILL? WHEN DO THE BAD GUYS TURN INTO THE SICK GUYS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN KONNER MD, Konner, an anthropologist and a nonpracticing physician, 
is the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Anthropology at Emory University. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When I heard that Wade Boggs, the Boston Red Sox third baseman, had publicly 
declared himself a sex addict, it set me to brooding about responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I admit I'm inherently lazy. Not enough to avoid thought altogether, but 
enough to keep it within certain channels. Boggs, however, got me thinking 
about some questions I had not taken an interest in since college. For 20 years 
or so I've been thinking about human behavior scientifically -- first in 
anthropology, later in medicine. I was interested in the causes of behavior -- 
normal or abnormal. If you could explain what caused a behavior, you could, if 
you wanted to, try to change it with some sort of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But the notion of Wade Boggs as a sex addict brought me up short. I knew about 
sex addiction, but (like most health professionals, including most 
psychiatrists) I was dubious about the category. I associated compulsive 
sexuality as an abnormality with women who were allowing themselves to be 
widely and consistently used. I knew that there were compulsively promiscuous 
men, but I just thought of them as bad guys. In a world where the risk of sex 
is so much greater for women, and where men typically have more power, my 
natural impulse didn't lean toward medical sympathy for fellows like Boggs. I 
suppressed the possibility that a medical explanation existed. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this was naive; in a few minutes I myself could have chosen a label 
from the American Psychiatric Assn.'s official diagnostic manual -- probably 
something in the range of impulse-control disorders, although a more pervasive 
personality disorder might produce the same symptoms. But in the case of Boggs' 
celebrated affair with Margo Adams, for some reason I tried to avoid labeling. 
I thought back on others who have come, at a certain point in life, to regret 
the sexual excesses of their youth -- St. Augustine, for instance, and Leo 
Tolstoy. But here something was missing. They were saying words like, I did 
something very wrong. I repent of it now. You should think ill of me, and you 
probably should punish me -- with censure, if nothing worse -- but please, 
ultimately, forgive me. I tried to understand why this bothered me; it was not 
merely the spectacle of a powerful man abusing his power and then requesting 
sympathy. What troubled me was the medical question at the heart of the 
spectacle: How much can the concept of illness expand at the expense of the 
idea of responsibility? When do the bad guys turn into sick guys? 
</P>
<P>
Although the question ranges far beyond that of illegal acts and into the realm 
of the purely moral, most Americans have had this issue brought to their 
attention in the 1980s by two celebrated criminal cases. First John Hinckley, 
who had attempted to assassinate President Reagan, was determined by some court 
psychiatrists to be mentally ill -- and more important, to be mentally ill in a 
way that meant he was not guilty as charged. Interestingly, a then-new 
technique known as computed tomography -- CT scanning -- was used to study his 
brain, and it showed what some experts called an abnormal shape, pointing to a 
greatly expanded future -- even futuristic -- role for technology in answering 
moral questions. Second, Dan White, who had killed the mayor of San Francisco 
and one of his aides, claimed in his defense that he had eaten a junk food diet 
high in refined sugar, and that this diet had diminished his ability to 
restrain his violent impulses -- the celebrated "Twinkie defense." This 
suggested that almost any medical fad, however poorly supported by evidence, 
could influence the judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
Both defenses convinced the courts, and there are similar cases all the time. 
They come up within a framework of legal reasoning that emerged in the 19th 
Century, often referred to as the M'Naghten Rule (pronounced "MikNAW-tn"). 
Daniel M'Naghten, in a crime foreshadowing the Hinckley case, had attempted to 
kill the English Prime Minister in 1843. M'Naghten had been in the grip of 
paranoid delusions, but his exculpation produced a public outcry as well -- 
despite the fact that he was committed permanently to an asylum. A committee 
convened by Queen Victoria arrived at the first formal rules for an insanity 
plea: The accused had to not know either "the nature and quality of the act" or 
the fact that "he was doing what was wrong." Later an emotion-based defense was 
added to the essentially knowledge-based approach of M'Naghten. Although it is 
usually called "irresistible impulse," the emotion does not have to be sudden 
for this defense to work. The main point has to do with the loss, due to 
"mental disease or defect," of the power to choose. 
</P>
<P>
Together these rules made it possible for mental illness to bring a person 
under the protection of two ancient legal concepts: ignorance and coercion, 
either of which, in certain circumstances, could limit guilt for crime. In the 
legal tradition that has come down to us today, mental derangement -- temporary 
or long term -- can be used as evidence that the defendant was in the grip of 
an "irresistible impulse," or that the illness so clouded his judgement that he 
was ignorant of the moral meaning of what he did as he did it -- in the common 
phrase, "he couldn't tell right from wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs' self-confessed "sex addiction" is no crime, but a wide spectrum of 
acts of questionable morality -- whether legal or not -- are now falling under 
the rubric of "illness." Even as certain categories of human behavior -- 
homosexuality in America, for instance, and perhaps now political nonconformity 
in the Soviet Union -- are being "delisted" from the ranks of psychiatric 
categories, new diagnoses are being added. Increasingly, doctors -- rather than 
pastors or prosecutors -- are taking charge of these acts by labeling them with 
a new kind of language. And with these labels they are shaping our emotional 
reactions to deeds that we once would have said, quite simply, were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Consider three cases. Once, in a medical school psychiatry clerkship, I 
attended a hearing in which the state was trying to show that a man convicted 
of homicide but found to be mentally ill should continue to be kept in a prison 
hospital for the criminally insane. His family retained a lawyer who presented 
a theory of why the young man had gone on a rampage assaulting a series of 
people with an ax. The lawyer had read some studies claiming to show that too 
much copper was a cause of irrational violence. Now, the young man was said to 
have drunk enormous amounts of milk as a child. According to other studies, 
milk reduced the absorption of copper. Since, went the theory, an excess of 
copper could cause violence, probably a deficiency of copper could too. 
</P>
<P>
This extremely far-fetched argument was not successful -- indeed, it was 
difficult to see its purpose, since the young man was already deemed mentally 
ill, and was being given treatment rather than (merely) being imprisoned. Yet I 
was stunned: a completely baseless and self-contradictory "scientific" argument 
was politely heard by all concerned, with no form of reprimand to the lawyer, 
who had no basis for a claim of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, returning to the same prison hospital with a 
psychiatrist-teacher, I helped him interview a young man who had confessed to 
killing a woman when she reprimanded him for urinating on her lawn. He had been 
working for a lawn-care company, and was apparently exposed to large quantities 
of organic phosphates, which he was required to handle as fertilizer. The 
psychiatrist was preparing a case based on the notion that the organic 
phosphates in the fertilizer had given the man an uncharacteristic violent 
impulse. I pored through the doctor's stack of copied research papers. Organic 
phosphates in large doses certainly could cause nerve damage, which the young 
man did not have. Rarely, they had apparently caused brain damage too, but 
almost always in association with nerve damage. Nowhere in the literature was 
there a case of brain damage caused by organic phosphates and resulting in 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't help thinking that 30 years earlier a psychiatrist with a Freudian 
orientation would have seized on the interpersonal situation -- a young man 
urinating in the wrong place is surprised and reprimanded by an older woman -- 
and related the violent outburst to deep problems stemming from his childhood, 
complete with Oedipus complex and castration anxiety. Now, in the '80s -- the 
era of biological psychiatry -- we had instead an equally tortuous, and equally 
unsupported, biochemical theory. 
</P>
<P>
The third case came closest to home. I was approached by a criminal defense 
lawyer and asked to testify on behalf of his client. This was a man who, under 
supposedly extreme provocation, had killed his lover in a fit of jealousy. The 
lawyer had read a book of mine about human nature, in which (among many other 
things) I described situations similar to his client's as occurring in cultures 
throughout the world, and indeed as having parallels in many animal societies. 
He wanted me to testify to these facts of anthropology, which he would then 
argue diminished his client's responsibility for the homicide. This was not an 
insanity defense, but intended instead to show that the man did not have "mens 
reus" -- the criminal intent needed for complete guilt. 
</P>
<P>
I wrestled with the ethics of this gambit: Would I be wrong to lend myself to 
it? Or, in our advocacy system of justice, would I be wrong to refuse to state 
what I knew?. But then I was let off the hook by the lawyer, who had found 
another defense. This too was instructive: his client had taken barbiturates by 
prescription before the crime, and they had found a psychiatrist who would 
testify that this could have impaired his capacity to act in accord with the 
law. The lawyer did not want to confuse the jury by invoking two sorts of 
exonerating expert testimony, and he was more comfortable with a psychiatric 
theory of an abnormal state of mind than with an anthropological theory of a 
passionate, predictable one. 
</P>
<P>
ither way, and in every one of these cases, the decision should be made by a 
judge and jury. Only the common sense exercised by the jury and the common law 
interpreted by the judge should count, not the expert testimony. But in reality 
judges and juries are influenced by experts -- including those who go far 
beyond scientific knowledge in their testimony. And in the cases like Boggs' 
noncriminal questions of moral judgement, we as a society, and even ethical 
advisers like ministers, priests, rabbis and teachers are inevitably influenced 
by changing cultural concepts of illness and responsibility. The extremes in 
this controversy were staked out by many years ago. Karl Menninger, a 
distinguished psychiatrist for whom (among other physician family-members) the 
famous clinic in Topeka, Kansas is named, has been a longtime advocate of the 
use of medical diagnoses of criminals. He wrote as early as 1928, "the time 
will come when stealing and murder will be thought of as a symptom, indicating 
the presence of a disease, a personality disease." And almost a half-century 
later, in response to the notion that wicked people exist, he said, "I don't 
believe in such a thing as the 'criminal mind.' Everyone's mind is 'criminal'; 
we're all capable of criminal fantasies and thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1950s psychiatry was at the peak of its power. Freudian 
psychoanalytic theory, in a modified American form, appeared to have won the 
day, and the courts were showing signs of accepting Menninger's thesis. Clergy, 
for their part, were mastering the art and science of psychotherapy. We seemed, 
as a culture, to have gone well down a path toward defining -- medically -- 
wickedness out of existence, and with it, punishment. There would only be 
illness, treatment, and ultimate reintegration of the normalized individual 
into society. The courts and the churches alike were scrambling to avoid being 
left behind as the new science led the community in a race out of the sphere of 
moral judgement, having jettisoned outmoded concepts like responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Just at this moment Thomas Szasz -- a psychiatrist who has been his own 
profession's most severe critic -- appeared on the intellectual landscape. His 
1961 book, "The Myth of Mental Illness," challenged almost every aspect of 
psychiatry and publicly declared its legal authority to be illegitimate. The 
book's subtitle, "Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct," was 
significant. "Human behavior," he wrote, "is fundamentally moral behavior." He 
argued that individuals must be allowed to take drugs, commit suicide, and do 
harm to others without prior restraint and take the consequences of their acts 
-- addiction, death, or the full force of the law -- regardless of 
psychological conditions. "The concept of mental illness," he wrote elsewhere, 
"is betrayal of common sense and of an ethical view of man." 
</P>
<P>
summary added to the book in 1974 stated, "Psychiatric diagnoses are 
stigmatizing labels, phrased to resemble medical diagnoses and applied to 
persons whose behavior annoys or offends others" and, "The introduction of 
psychiatric considerations into the administration of the criminal law -- for 
example, the insanity plea and verdict, diagnoses of mental incompetence to 
stand trial, and so forth -- corrupt the law and victimize the subject on whose 
behalf they are ostensibly employed." Szasz, like Menninger, has been 
consistent over the course of a long career. In 1972, he wrote an article in 
the British medical journal, The Lancet, called "Bad Habits Are Not Diseases." 
And in a letter to the New York Times published on June 12, 1989, he wrote that 
even the most severe crack addicts, if violent, are "criminals first and 
patients second, if at all." 
</P>
<P>
Partly under his goad, and further stimulated in the '80s by the Hinckley case 
and the "Twinkie defense," a public outcry has altered the insanity plea as it 
stood in common law and in the Model Penal Code of the prestigious American Law 
Institute. The penal code in the 1950s helped standardize the common law 
traditions and affected law in many states but its influence has weakened since 
Hinckley. The American Bar Assn. and the American Psychiatric Assn. both 
proposed an elimination of the "irresistible impulse" rule. In 1984 the Federal 
Criminal Code adopted this suggestion, and also abandoned the wording 
"substantial incapacity" in favor of "complete incapacity." In practical terms 
very few cases were affected -- most crimes are tried under state law -- but 
the message was influential. More than half the states, including California, 
have followed suit on "irresistible impulse." In addition, several states have 
adopted a new verdict: "guilty but mentally ill," which defense lawyers feel 
destroys the insanity plea, undermining a traditional pillar of justice. 
</P>
<P>
This public reaction against the insanity plea was understandable; highly 
publicized cases had begun to make it seem as if the very idea of right and 
wrong was being abandoned. Yet the reaction was based in part on major 
misconceptions, which could swing the pendulum too far away from the 
psychiatric concept of criminal actions -- a highly legitimate approach in 
certain situations. But before one passes judgement on the insanity defense, 
three things should be considered. First -- contrary to Menninger's sweeping 
prediction, and despite the famous cases -- only a fraction of criminal 
defenses invoke the insanity plea, and only a fraction of that fraction 
succeed. Also, studies of arrests show that few crimes, and even fewer violent 
crimes -- under 5% -- are accounted for by former mental patients. Popular 
fears aside, few mental patients are dangerous. Second, experts are not in 
charge of the decision -- a jury and judges are in charge. They review the 
evidence, hear the expert testimony on both sides, and make the kind of 
judgement that courts have made for centuries before psychiatry was invented. 
Third, a successful insanity defense need not "get the guy off the hook and out 
on the street" promptly, as many fear. On the contrary, this outcome is rare. 
In almost all states a verdict of "not guilty by reason of insanity" requires 
at least the consideration of commitment, and in some, commitment is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
The recent near-release of Arthur Jackson from prison shows what can happen if 
a sick criminal is not medically labeled. Jackson was convicted of attempted 
murder in the 1982 assault of actress Theresa Saldana outside her West 
Hollywood apartment. Though he attacked her with exceptional brutality -- 
stabbing her so hard and so many times that his hunting knife bent -- and then, 
while in prison, repeatedly threatened to kill her upon release, Jackson was 
about to be released early from an ordinary criminal sentence, for good 
behavior. In June, however, the California Board of Prison Terms delayed his 
parole for 270 days for breaking prison windows and resisting guards' efforts 
to subdue him. Jackson had a long history of mental illness before the assault. 
Ironically, if he had been found guilty by reason of insanity, his continuing 
psychosis would have allowed authorities to keep him behind bars in a prison 
mental hospital indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of using the concept of illness to lengthen detention beyond what the 
criminal sentence would have dictated is anathema to civil libertarians. Yet it 
was narrowly supported by the Supreme Court in 1983, and it may be the most 
appropriate response in many cases. Some violent crime is the result of mental 
illness. If detention and deterrence are two of the goals of justice, then they 
may sometimes be attained more effectively through a medical approach. 
</P>
<P>
In the heyday of psychiatric exoneration, psychiatrists claimed to know more 
than they knew. They claimed to be able to predict future behavior, and to be 
able to cure the mental illnesses that cause crime. As is pointed out by Szasz 
and by Jonas Robitscher, who was doubly trained in psychiatry and law, these 
claims were greatly exaggerated. Robitscher's 1980 book, "The Powers of 
Psychiatry," showed some of the limits of the claims, and studies over the past 
decade have proven him right. Prediction is almost impossible, cure is always 
partial at best, and even diagnosis cannot be agreed upon by experts in 
conflict. In Robitscher's words, "the medical basis for psychiatric authority 
must continue to be questioned." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, such authority must also continue to be considered. If cures for 
most mental illnesses elude us, diagnosis is in a more advanced state -- much 
better, in fact, than it was even in 1980. Judgements must somehow be both 
moral and medical. If a jury identifies a crime, it can, with the consultation 
of experts, also identify an illness. Whether the illness is treatable, 
resulting in a shorter period of incarceration than simple imprisonment, or 
untreatable, resulting in a longer detention, a fair approach to wrongdoers 
cannot omit this consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Yet medical labeling must not result in the elimination of punishment. This 
threat must enter the mind -- however diseased -- of every person who 
contemplated a wrongful act. In a world of uncertainties, only capital 
punishment seems unacceptable; it obviously differs from institutionalization 
in a way that imprisonment does not. In fact, our frequent inability to rule 
out mental illness is one of the best arguments against the death penalty. That 
penalty aside, the decision as to who shall be incarcerated for detention and 
punishment, and who for detention and treatment, can tolerate a certain amount 
of ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
Two stories, one true and one apocryphal, give glimpses of the balance between 
impulse and blame as it may have appeared at the dawn of human consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The true one comes from observations by anthropologist Richard Lee of the !Kung 
San of Botswana -- a hunting and gathering people whom I also lived with and 
studied for two years. These are people without lawyers or judges -- without 
any legal forms or authority -- and certainly without psychiatry. Lee showed 
that homicides occur among them in a frequency not very different from our own; 
there is sometimes revenge but there is no legal recourse. However, in one case 
of a man who killed three times, the community concluded that he was incurably 
violent. This, in a sense, was a primitive psychiatric diagnosis, but the 
response in this society without police or prisons, hospitals or psychiatrists, 
was not and could not be incarceration or medical treatment. With no other 
choice open to them, three men premeditated his homicide, lay in ambush for 
him, and killed him. 
</P>
<P>
The second story comes from a Midrash -- a rabbinic legend -- about the 
conversation between Cain and God in Genesis, regarding Cain's crime of 
fratricide. According to the Midrash, the argument goes on for some time after 
Cain asks insolently, "Am I my brother's keeper?" His final challenge to God is 
the most intriguing one: "You made me as I am. You put the evil inclination in 
me. Therefore I am not responsible." Thus, without mentioning mental illness, 
an ancient legend raised the same philosophical problem: If evil is built into 
some personalities, how can we confront them with blame? But the rabbis were 
not much impressed by Cain's challenge. The Talmud says, "Who is strong? He who 
conquers his inclination." Cain, they conceded, was -- like the rest of us -- 
endowed with an evil inclination, but also with a good one, and with a rational 
ethical faculty designed to set and keep the balance tipped against evil. 
</P>
<P>
As we enter the 1990s, we as a society will have to accept more and more 
evidence that a large part of what we call wickedness is also mental illness. 
Not only psychoses and depressions with delusional features, but also certain 
impulse control disorders, adjustment disorders, sexual disorders, and 
personality disorders are legitimate psychiatric diagnoses that might tend to 
cause crime or non-criminal wrongdoing. And the frontier of diagnosis is moving 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
Consider an instance of sexual harassment of a female employee by her male 
boss, while he is under the influence of alcohol. He may blame the alcohol, and 
this tactic would work if he were involuntarily intoxicated. But we expect him 
to know that drinking may lead to such wrongs, and so we hold him accountable. 
Now suppose he is an alcoholic. He has a diagnosable substance-abuse disorder. 
Do we exonerate him because of this illness? Probably not; he should have known 
better than to drink himself into it. But now we have one last, new twist: in 
the '80s it has been decisively shown that some individuals are genetically 
predisposed to the development of alcoholism. Our man turns out to be one of 
them (in a few years time, a test of his DNA may be available to prove it.) 
What do we say now? Do we blame him for an immoral act at the end of a chain of 
events that began with a hereditary defect? I suspect that the answer is yes -- 
that we help him and blame him both -- but clearly the judgement is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
In the realm of crime, a substantial minority of criminals has what in the past 
was called psychopathy or sociopathy and is currently called antisocial 
personality disorder. Such personalities have been extensively studied by 
psychologists. Compared to average people, they are sensation-seekers whose 
attachments to others are shallow, who experience little guilt, and who are 
relatively unresponsive to the threat of punishment. Strictly speaking, such 
people have a diagnosable mental illness. But the courts have been properly 
reluctant to accept an insanity plea from someone whose main symptom is 
repetitive antisocial behavior. Along the same line, the short-lived Durham 
rule, or "product test," of insanity was applied in the District of Columbia 
for a decade beginning 1954. It stated that the insanity plea was valid if the 
crime was the product of the person's mental illness. This rule was dropped 
because it threatened to widen the insanity plea to encompass most crimes. The 
courts have thus essentially rejected Menninger's view in "The Crime of 
Punishment" that all crime is evidence of mental illness. "Blame and 
punishment," says one recent law text, "are central to the criminal law." They 
are also central to the moral fabric of society. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits to punishment; a society as complex and capable as ours only 
humiliates itself when it resorts to the same tactic -- removal by death -- 
that the otherwise helpless !Kung were forced to apply. Yet neither can we 
pretend that we have advanced very far in remediating the illnesses that partly 
cause crime. And if we can't cure mentally ill criminals, then we need to 
separate them from potential victims. To refuse to grant them treatment while 
they are incarcerated is simply inhumane to them; but to release them in 
essentially the same disordered state of mind in which they committed crimes 
before is inhumane to their victims -- past and future.

about the people with these problems -- they certainly may have diagnosable 
mental illnesses -- there must, as in criminal cases, be some sense of 
accountability. Even if these individuals have weaknesses that are greater than 
average, or impulses stronger than average, or rational ethical faculties less 
capable than average, we as a society must strengthen their self-control -- and 
our own -- by insisting that we all give an account of ourselves as moral 
agents. No amount of explanation can be allowed to stand in the way of this 
accounting. It is true, as Menninger said, that we are all capable of criminal 
fantasies and thoughts; but only some of us carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
Whether we are talking about a presidential assassin, a child abuser, a 
street-wise crack addict, a compulsively promiscuous man, or an alcoholic 
celebrity drying out at a famous clinic, some expectation of moral restraint is 
always applicable. The tension between these two views of unwanted behavior is 
far from new. Aristotle's ethics include the observation that "foolish people 
whose folly arises from disease, e.g. from epilepsy, or from insanity, are in a 
morbid state," and implies that they are not responsible for their acts; yet 
speculates that "it is perhaps wrong to say that actions which are due to 
passion or desire are involuntary." The Mishnah, which contains much of the 
foundation of Jewish ethics, observes, "An encounter with a deaf-mute, an 
idiot, or a minor is bad, for you are liable and they are not;" but it also 
says, "Man is always responsible, whether his act is intentional or 
inadvertent, whether he is awake or asleep." 
</P>
<P>
And James M. Gustafson, one of the leading Christian ethicists of our time, 
although widely known for his compassionate liberal theology, said recently: 
"If all actions for which we might be held responsible are classified as 
addictions or illnesses, then we totally surrender the sense of moral 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
A famous phrase of Freud's is usually translated as "Where id was, there ego 
shall be," implying a rendering of the irrational to make it accessible to 
reality. But the passage may really mean "Where 'it' was, there 'I' shall be." 
This message, something like the opposite of psychological exculpation, is a 
far superior legacy for Freud to have left us. We would all like to point at an 
illness -- a psychiatric label -- and say of our weak or bad actions, "That 
thing, the illness, it did it, not me. It." But at some point we must draw 
ourselves up to our full height, and say in a clear voice what we have done and 
why it was wrong. And we must use the word "I," not "it" or "illness." I did 
it, I. I.

science and medicine for Time magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every few weeks Dr. Brian D. Ross leaves his laboratory in Pasadena and takes 
off for San Francisco on an unusual mission of mercy. On these trips the 
50-year-old physician-researcher is accompanied by a seriously ill though 
mobile cancer patient. When their commercial jet lands, doctor and patient head 
directly for a nondescript factory building on the waterfront near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
When Ross and his patient -- call him Mr. M -- arrive at their destination, the 
headquarters of Diasonics Inc., a manufacturer of high-tech medical equipment 
in South San Francisco, they go immediately to a back room dominated by a large 
steel-box-type structure. Inside sits a doughnut-shaped contraption about the 
size of a small van. While Ross waits in a nearby control room, hovering over 
video monitors, M sheds his watch and wallet, slips into a loose-fitting 
examination gown and mounts a cushioned platform on which he can be slid into 
the doughnut. As the device swallows him up, only his stockinged feet extend 
out. 
</P>
<P>
For the next hour, while the huge device thumps and knocks, M lies inside it, 
silent and motionless. Actually, since only a few inches of space are between 
him and the circular all that surrounds him, he can do little else. In the 
control room, Ross intently watches as successive slices of M's brain flash 
onto the screen. Occasionally he shouts words of encouragement to his enclosed 
patient: "Very good, just a few minutes more." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a particularly cheerful assignment for Ross, a distinguished, affable 
British scientist who recently joined the staff of the Huntington Medical 
Research Institutes. His patient has a malignancy of the brain, a tumor so 
large it cannot be removed by surgery or treated by radiation or chemotherapy. 
For the patient, the conventional weapons of oncology have been exhausted. "I 
suppose you could say that by any existing medical measure," Ross says, "he's . 
. . under a death sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Huntington's doctors have not given up on M. As part of a bold 
experimental program for patients beyond the pale of other treatments, he is 
receiving a radical new therapy. Its object: to stir the patient's own immune 
system back to life, so it can fight the growing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
M's doctors at the Huntington Medical Center have taken some of his white blood 
cells, or lymphocytes -- part of the immune system's weapons against invaders 
-- and mixed them with interleukin 2, a naturally occurring chemical messenger 
used by the body to prod the lymphocytes into renewed activity. Human 
interleukin 2 is so hard to obtain in any quantity that doctors are forced to 
use an identical, genetically engineered substitute. The mixture has been 
in-jected directly into M's tumor in hopes that the revived lymphocytes will 
begin attacking the rapidly dividing cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
Is the novel treatment working? Has it reduced the size of tumor? "X-rays can't 
really show us," says Ross. "By the time we could detect a change, it might 
well be too late." The only other method would be to open the skull to take a 
biopsy. But such a surgical procedure is out of the question for the severly 
weakened patient. 
</P>
<P>
So Ross must use some other means to peer inside M's brain. That is the purpose 
of their trip to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The examination of M involves an experimental technique called Magnetic 
Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). It is vaguely reminiscent of a CT(computed 
tomography) scan, which uses X-rays and computer technology to provide views of 
virtually any part of the body a physician may want to see. But the similarity 
is only superficial. The machine doesn't probe with X-rays. It ferrets out the 
body's inner secrets by listening to its own signals -- the faint emissions 
given off by its constituent atoms and molecules, including those of M's 
massive tumor. 
</P>
<P>
To get the tumorous tissue to "talk" -- to reveal whether it has been affected 
by the experi- mental treatment -- the machine relies on an extremely intense 
magnetic field, thousands stronger then the earth's, accompanied by pulses of 
radio waves. The pulses evoke faint electromagnetic echoes from M's tumor, 
which are a tip-off to its chemical state. 
</P>
<P>
This diagnostic wizardry is based on a technique known as nuclear magnetic 
resonance. The idea, dating to the 1940s, is old hat to physicists and 
chemists; Stanford's Felix Bloch and Harvard's Edward Purcell shared the 1952 
Nobel Prize in Physics for developing it. It has long been used for studying 
nonliving materials. But only now is it beginning to touch diagnostic medicine, 
studying living things. 
</P>
<P>
Already the results are little short of revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
As Ross explains, "We're able to see aspects of living tissue that have never 
before been visible other than by cutting or other invasive techniques. The 
potential of the technique is enormous. If we can monitor the biochemical 
processes of a disease noninvasively, it will surely give us an early insight 
into the nature of the disease and its response to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Magnetic resonance holds promise not only for cancer, but for heart attacks, 
brain and spinal injuries and a variety of muscle-weakening diseases including 
multiple sclerosis, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution of magnetic resonance -- doctors have dropped the word 
"nuclear," lest it unnecessarily frighten their patients -- is taking shape in 
two distinct ways: 
</P>
<P>
MRS, which pinpoints and measures key bodily chemicals, like those that may be 
feeding the fires of M's brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
And MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which produces actual images, X-ray-like 
slices of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Though barely a decade old, MRI is clearly one of the hottest areas of 
diagnostic medicine. Some 1,200 scanners are in use around the country (costing 
up to $3 million each), and MRI is rapidly closing the gap with CT scanning as 
a way of probing the body. In the next few years, the number of machines may 
well double as manufacturers such as General Electric, Philips, Pickering and 
Diasonics, all of whom currently manufacture magnetic resonance devices, 
compete for what is already a billion-dollar-a-year scanner market. "It's been 
taking off like a rocket," Ross says. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of doctors for the new technology is easy to understand. MRI not 
only avoids potentially harmful ionizing radiation such as X-rays, but also 
produces images of astonishing clarity, revealing the outlines of soft tissue 
like tumors, which are beyond the reach of X-rays and could be studied until 
now only by biopsies or the injection of radioisotopes. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of magnetically created images was first proposed in the United States 
after the advent of the required superconducting magnets (typically chilled by 
liquid helium down to -450 degrees Fahrenheit, only four degrees above absolute 
zero) and high-speed computer graphics. But the actual development of the new 
technology was left to the British. In 1973 a group in Aberdeen, Scotland -- an 
offshoot of a pioneering team at the University of Nottingham -- obtained the 
first whole-body image of a living creature using magnetic resonance: It was a 
cross-section of a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
But the British mouse didn't roar for long. Leadership in the field quickly 
passed back to the United States. "We British seem to have a gift for letting 
technology slip out of our grasp," says Ross, who is himself joined the brain 
drain of workers in the field when he came to Huntington last year to direct 
its spectroscopy unit. "Each of the major groups in the States has been headed 
at one time or another by an Englishman," Ross says. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Ross's American colleague, Dr. William G. Bradley, 
Huntington's imaging unit had already become the busiest in the world. Since it 
began operating in 1983, it has performed more than 18,000 MRI scans. 
</P>
<P>
But it is MRS that Ross and his colleagues in the United States and abroad 
believe may hold even greater promise. Though it has actually been around 
longer than MRI, MRS is far less familiar and is in its experimental infancy. 
It doesn't produce images -- "just squiggles," says Ross, but to knowing eyes 
like his, they are as meaningful as any picture. 
</P>
<P>
Ross's squiggles are the spectra -- or fingerprints, if you will -- of the 
body's chemicals. Jogged by radio waves in the presence of the magnet's 
powerful field, each of the target compounds responds in a uniquely 
characteristic way, transmitting its own jagged spike signature to the monitor. 
Unfortunately, says Ross, that's the sort of thing even trained MDs aren't 
always comfortable with; they are used to -- and prefer -- looking at images. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds them of the biochemistry courses that they came to hate in college 
or medical school." 
</P>
<P>
Partly for this "psychological" reason, but also because it requires more 
powerful magnets, MRS has been much slower to catch on than its younger sibling 
MRI, but Ross and others predict that situation will change. When it does, they 
say, the diagnosis and treatment of certain cancers and other diseases will be 
significantly advanced. 
</P>
<P>
MRS is available only at a few places, such as the Diasonics plant, the 
Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco and Duke University, on 
an experimental basis to selected patients like Ross's M. (Huntington is 
installing a powerful new magnet, capable of producing a field of 1.5 tesla -- 
about 30,000 times the strength of the earth's magnetic field -- that will be 
shared by both Bradley's imaging team and Ross's spectroscopists.) But if Ross 
and his colleagues have their way, it will soon move out of the experimental 
stage and into medicine's mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael C. Weiner, who runs the MRS lab at the VA hospital in San 
Francisco, is sure that day is rapidly approaching. "This technique allows us 
to 'see' how the cells are working," says the 48-year-old transplanted New 
Yorker, "without cutting or needles, without X-rays, without any harmful 
radiation. Just magnetism and radio waves." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it shuns scalpels, Weiner's lab has certainly been on the cutting edge. 
In close collaboration with the University of California San Francisco Medical 
Center, it is using MRS to unravel the chemistry of heart attacks, of brain and 
spinal injuries, even of muscle fatigue -- the later, surprisingly, still 
largely a mystery even after many years of research. 
</P>
<P>
In a cleverly designed series of experiments, healthy young men flexed their 
muscles in a specially built exerciser, while MRS scrutinized the metabolic 
chemistry of their exertions. As they exercised, the expected biochemical 
changes were documented: The store of the metabolite phosphocreatine in their 
muscles decreased; the synthesis of ATP, an energy-storing compound that fuels 
cellular activity, dropped off; the concentration of lactic acid rose; 
eventually the muscles no longer would contract. 
</P>
<P>
Such studies aren't merely helpful to would-be jocks, says UC San Francisco's 
Dr. Robert G. Miller. They may eventually aid those who suffer from such 
muscle-weakening diseases as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). At last year's annual 
meeting of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, held in San 
Francisco, dozens of doctors flocked to the basement lab to see for themselves 
the big magnet where these and other MRS experiments have been done. 
</P>
<P>
Of special interest to doctors is the metabolism of cancer cells. While 
chemotherapy and radiation have scored some major successes in controlling 
their rapid growth, oncologists work largely in the dark as they try to 
estimate what dosages and combinations of drugs and radiation will work. 
Huntington's Bradley sums up the situation: "We're still in the Stone Age when 
it comes to treating cancer. The metabolism of cancer cells fluctuates from day 
to day, yet we dose patients with drugs and radiation without any idea of what 
stage the cells are in at the particular moment of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
That could soon change because MRS can detect shifts in cellular metabolism 
almost as soon as they occur. In a recent experiment on himself, Dr. James W. 
Prichard at Yale University imbibed some Champagne, underwent a brain scan and 
almost immediately found a sharp ethanol (alcohol) spike. It represented the 
chemical changes induced in the cells of his brain by the bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, West German doctors, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have 
been able to track chemical changes in the brain's visual center when the eyes 
open and when they close. By looking for chemicalk changes in response to 
physical stimuli, the techniques could be used to map other areas of the brain, 
an organ that still remains something of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the rapid detection of chemical changes may enable doctors to pick 
the precise moment that cancer cells are most receptive to chemotherapy. And 
almost immediately after the anti-cancer drugs are administered, MRS could be 
used to monitor their effectiveness against the target cells. No longer would 
doctors have to wait weeks or months to look for shrinkage or growth of a 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was in quest of just such an assessment that Ross flew to San 
Francisco with his cancer-ridden patient. 
</P>
<P>
"The examination lets us detect a number of things that tell us something about 
the reaction of the tumor cells to the treatment," he explains. "We can, for 
example, detect the presence -- or absence -- of ATP. We can also pick up other 
metabolites . . . as well as inorganic phosphates and even pH, or cellular 
acidity." 
</P>
<P>
The relative amounts detected -- as measured by the size of the squiggles on 
the monitor of his machine -- are a precise indication of whether a cluster of 
cancer cells is growing or being held in check. "The key," says Ross, "is 
phosphocreatine because if its levels return to normal you know that the 
patient is most probably responding to the treatment." Phosphocreatine is a 
sensitive indicator of a depleted energy state. Successful treatment is also 
likely to be signaled by a rise in the level of inorganic phosphate since this 
is a breakdown product of dying cells. 
</P>
<P>
The biochemical intricacies of such measurements do not faze Ross, a specialist 
in metabolic diseases who studied biochemistry under Nobel laureate Sir Hans 
Krebs. His first clinical triumph with MRS came at Oxford in 1981. It involved 
a retired sailor plagued by continual fatigue. Ross suspected McArdle's 
syndrome, a rare genetic disease in which the muscles can't break down the 
sugar glycogen, used as a source of energy to fuel contraction. The disease 
could have been confirmed by biopsy or complex chemical tests. But he was 
determined to provide a diagnosis simply and noninva- sively. Using a magnet 
just big enough to enclose the patient's arm, he charted precisely the expected 
deficiencies in the man's muscle metabolism -- and dramatically confirmed his 
hunch. The man had the muscle- weakening syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Ross's diagnostic feat was glowingly received. "The introduction of a new 
technique to the bedside always stimulates intellectual reverberations that go 
beyond the narrow range of the instrument," editorialized The New England 
Journal of Medicine. "Perhaps the most important contribution (of MRS) to 
clinical medicine will be that it will make us start thinking about familiar 
diseases in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who helped recruit Ross to Pasadena, calls spectroscopy a technique 
looking for an application. "We have hundreds of spectroscopists that would 
like to do their trade in a medical environment. Instead of high-falutin' 
laboratory science, they want to bring spectroscopy down to earth and do it in 
a worthwhile way that will help patients. Brian is trying to do that." 
</P>
<P>
It's now late in the day. Ross has finished his work with M at the factory 
site, and the men are heading back to San Francisco airport. "What did you 
learn, Doc?" M asks. Ross smiles. "I'd say that for now the news is good. The 
tumor hasn't grown." 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, doctor and patient will return to San Francisco for another 
session with the powerful magnet to see if the news is still good.

ENGINEERED EDIBLES MAY CHANGE THE WAY WE EAT BUT IT MAY BE AT THE EXPENSE OF 
MORE HEALTHFUL DIETARY CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Scott is a Times medical writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The intrepid science of food engineering reached an improbable juncture at UC 
Berkeley recently when food scientist Benito de Lumen began designing a bean 
devoid of that disconcerting attribute for which the legume is best known. 
</P>
<P>
De Lumen's quest for a flatulence-free frijole is part of a booming field of 
food research that has already produced such seeming gustatory oxymorons as 
low-cholesterol eggs, dietetic chocolate ice cream and high-fiber hamburger 
buns. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of scientists to design foods without their old drawbacks offers 
more than a promise of guilt-free gluttony: It holds out hope of controlling 
such threats as heart disease and cancer, linked to excesses in the American 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
But whether engineered food will fulfill that potential remains to be seen. 
Some nutritionists have doubts. They warn that such foods, consumed 
immoderately, could lead to new nutritional problems on a par with those they 
are intended to avert. 
</P>
<P>
"One could envision in the next 10 years that it would be possible to engineer 
any food that we eat that would be almost devoid of any nutritional content 
except for fiber, vitamins and minerals," says Theodore Labuza, a food 
scientist at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's very possible that the incredulous consumer . . . would begin eating 
these products solely. So they would end up not with vitamin or mineral 
deficiencies but . . . protein deficiencies and energy deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
What are the benefits and drawbacks of engineered foods? It is almost 
impossible to generalize. Some have no known shortcomings, but others may -- 
especially if they shoulder out more healthful foods from the American diet, 
nutritionists say. 
</P>
<P>
Low-fat and skim milk, for example, have no down-side. They offer all the 
benefits of whole milk without the fat and calories. Like modified mozzarella 
and ricotta cheese, they offer more protein, vitamins and calcium than the 
products they are designed to replace. 
</P>
<P>
But fat substitutes don't necessarily work that way. One, sucrose polyester, is 
not even digested by the body. That means that it has no calories or 
cholesterol, but that it also offers none of the essential fatty acids people 
need for growth and maintenance of their skin. 
</P>
<P>
Such a shortcoming matters little if the product is used in moderation. What 
concerns some nutritionists is that it might be consumed in excess, drawing 
eaters towards foods that have suddenly been rendered innocuous and away from 
more fortifying alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have both artificial sweeteners and fats, will people eat more cake?" 
wonders Audrey Cross, a nutritionist and lawyer at Columbia University School 
of Public Health. "And if they do, what will they be leaving out of their diet 
that they were eating before?" 
</P>
<P>
Not only might people eat less fruit, but they actually may eat more sugar as 
well. It remains to be proven that substitutes for foods such as fats and sugar 
can accomplish what promoters say they can -- that is, that they can reduce 
consumption of the real thing to recommended levels by substituting a less 
harmful alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption of sugars has risen steadily since the introduction of 
artificial sweeteners, health experts point out. Artificial-sweetener use has 
also soared, leading some experts to wonder whether sweeteners stimulate some 
people's appetite for sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Obesity, too, has continued to increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, there is no evidence that the proliferation of low-calorie foods, 
analogs and ingredients has affected the status of obesity in the United 
States," the Institute of Food Technologists, a professional scientific 
society, reported recently. "National statistics . . . show an increase in the 
prevalence of obesity, certainly no decrease." 
</P>
<P>
The first federal health and nutrition survey, conducted between 1971 and 1974, 
found that 28.8 million American adults were obese, 8.4 million of them 
severely. The second survey, done between 1976 and 1980, found that the numbers 
had risen to 34 million and 13 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the impetus for redesigning foods arises out of the growing evidence 
that diet plays a significant role in the development of chronic diseases -- 
specifically, diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, liver 
disease and cancer of the breast. 
</P>
<P>
Research indicates that one's risk of contracting such diseases can be 
controlled by selecting carefully the foods one eats. Numerous scientific 
panels have urged Americans to eat less food heavy in fat, and more high-fiber 
foods such as vegetables and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
"Engineering of foods, I think, is terrific," says Wayne Bidlack, an associate 
professor of pharmacology and nutrition at the University of Southern 
California. "We can decide what nutrients need to be delivered where, and 
design products for whatever is lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 8,000 of the food products introduced in the United States in 1987 
involved nutritional modification, industry statistics show. Of those, more 
than 400 boasted reduced calories, 159 lower fat, 120 reduced sugar and 55 
added fiber. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing petitions to market two fat 
substitutes. Several sugar surrogates are in wide use and others are on the 
way. Fiber is being transferred, meats are being restructured. Even the walnut 
is up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the food supply is very, very difficult to make your way through 
intelligently -- for a consumer or for a nutritionist," says Joan Gussow, a 
professor of nutrition and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, deciphering the nutritional benefits and drawbacks of engineered foods is 
left largely to the consumer: The FDA regulates food additives and foods for 
special dietary uses, but its scrutiny is limited largely to the product's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
The agency examines an additive's chemical structure and the levels at which it 
is toxic in animals. But it does not address whether the product is 
nutritionally beneficial or desirable, says Gerad L. McCowin, who heads the 
FDA's division of food and color additives. 
</P>
<P>
"That there's a synthetic fat substitute or an artificial sweetener available, 
in and of itself, is neither good nor bad societally or nutritionally," he 
says. "What's good or bad is how the individual combines those various foods." 
</P>
<P>
A prime target of food engineering is fat. Fats currently make up 37% to 40% of 
the average American adult's caloric intake, but experts in heart disease and 
cancer have recommended that Americans lower that level to 30% or less. 
</P>
<P>
Most attempts to reduce fat in animal products have involved simple physical 
steps such as close trimming of beef cuts. Through selective breeding, farmers 
have also been reducing the back fat in hogs and abdominal fat in poultry. 
</P>
<P>
So-called restructuring -- dismantling a piece of meat and putting the parts 
back together as a new product -- is being used to produce leaner meat. 
Although researchers say that salt is added to the meat in the process, they 
say it is in quantities too small to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Some new "lite" deli meats may have a greater problem with salt, according to 
the Institute of Food Technologists. For that reason, the group concluded that 
modified convenience foods may offer little nutritional advantage over 
carefully selected fresh meats. 
</P>
<P>
But the most radical assault on fats is coming from substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sucrose polyester is made by chemically linking several fatty acid molecules to 
a molecule of sucrose, or table sugar. Because of its structure, it is not 
metabolized by the body and therefore contributes no fat, calories or 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble, which calls the product Olestra, has applied to the FDA 
to use it in shortenings and oils. If used widely, Olestra theoretically could 
replace up to 35% of the fat in retail shortening and up to 75% of the fat used 
for frying snack foods and in deep frying. 
</P>
<P>
At those levels, the company figures that Olestra consumers could cut their 
daily fat consumption by five grams out of an average intake of 80 to 90 grams. 
The percentage of fat calories in their diets would drop from 37% to 35%, 
according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
The other fat substitute before the FDA is Simplesse, produced by the 
NutraSweet Co. It consists of milk and egg protein cooked and blended in such a 
way as to simulate what food scientists like to call the "mouth feel" of fat. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Olestra, Simplesse is digestible. But it has less than half the calories 
of ordinary fat. It would be used in products such as salad dressing, 
mayonnaise and ice cream, but not for cooking. NutraSweet predicts it could 
reduce a person's fat calories to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
"The fat substitutes . . . offer exciting opportunities for us to have the 
satisfaction we get out of products that contain fats without the extra weight 
gain," says Fred Caporaso, chairman of food science and nutrition at Chapman 
College in Orange. "That's kind of neat, I think. As long as they're safe." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is studying the safety of the fat substitutes. Both companies say their 
products are harmless in the context of a balanced diet -- although NutraSweet 
notes that Simplesse should not be eaten by people sensitive or allergic to 
milk or eggs. 
</P>
<P>
As for Olestra, Procter &amp; Gamble says it would not affect absorption of 
dietary proteins and carbohydrates or of most fat-soluble vitamins. Because it 
could reduce absorption of Vitamin E, the company intends to supplement Olestra 
with that vitamin. 
</P>
<P>
One consumer group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has 
challenged Procter &amp; Gamble's safety claim and the animal studies on which 
it is based. It has asked the FDA to require more studies exploring the 
long-term effects of Olestra use. 
</P>
<P>
One professor of food science at the University of Arkansas raised a more 
philosophical objection to the advent of foods that are not what they seem. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts an intellectual dimension in eating that I'm personally concerned 
about," says Harry E. Snyder. "I just don't want to ask every time I sit down, 
'Is this real or fake and should I adjust accordingly?' I want to know it's all 
real food." 
</P>
<P>
A second target of food engineering is sugar. Three low-calorie and 
non-nutritive sweeteners are being used widely, despite questions about their 
effects on health and despite the fact that consumption of sugars has continued 
to rise. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest is saccharin, a non-nutritive sweetener that is not metabolized and 
therefore non-caloric. It remains in use under special Congressional 
dispensation in spite of research data suggesting it may contribute to bladder 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
An FDA move to ban saccharin has been suspended until at least 1992 pending 
further research. Products containing saccharin bear a health warning, but 
reviews by the American Medical Assn. and food technologists have failed to 
establish a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
A second sugar substitute is aspartame, or NutraSweet, a protein that carries 
with it four calories per gram. Because it is up to 220 times as sweet as table 
sugar, aspartame can be used in such small amounts that it is virtually 
non-caloric. 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be safe in moderation, numerous groups have determined. Yet, 
there have been anecdotal reports of vision problems, seizures, headaches and 
dizziness. Aspartame accounts for four of every five complaints to the FDA 
concerning adverse reactions to food additives. 
</P>
<P>
The third available sweetener is acesulfame K, also known as Sunette. Approved 
in July, 1988, for use in dry mixes for beverages, instant coffee, puddings, 
non-dairy creamer and chewing gum, it is not metabolized and therefore 
contributes no calories to the diet. 
</P>
<P>
Professional opinion about the benefits of artificial sweeteners remains mixed. 
Bidlack calls aspartame "probably the most outstanding thing that happened to 
the sweetness market" because of its safety and sweetening power. But others 
are more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think health professionals are still wondering whether there's any real 
value in making a sweet product that doesn't have any health benefits of any 
kind," Snyder says. After all, he says, there is no evidence that sweeteners 
have cut overall sugar consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The next frontier for food engineers is cholesterol, believed by many 
researchers to be a prime culprit in cardiovascular disease. Because more than 
a third of dietary cholesterol comes from eggs, many researchers have focused 
on eggs first. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers claim to have already produced reduced-cholesterol eggs through 
selective breeding and control of chickens' diets. Some chickens have been fed 
fish oil, believed by some to lower cholesterol levels. But the eggs have 
occasionally ended up smelling of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers are testing more esoteric techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Beitz, a professor of animal science and biochemistry at Iowa State 
University, is working with an enzyme produced by bacteria in the human gut. 
According to Beitz, the enzyme breaks down cholesterol into an innocuous 
product that is then excreted. 
</P>
<P>
Beitz has tested extracts containing the the enzyme on milk, ground pork and 
egg yolk and has produced the expected breakdown product. He is now attempting 
to develop more of the enzyme, which he hopes some day might be available to be 
sprinkled on high-cholesterol foods. 
</P>
<P>
One other area that has attracted food engineers' attention is fiber -- 
specifically, adding fiber to foods. Epidemiological studies have linked 
reduced rates of some cancers and gastrointestinal diseases to diets heavy in 
high-fiber foods. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, food manufacturers have begun supplementing baked goods with 
sugar beet fiber and apple and oat fiber. So-called light breads often contain 
added fiber, as do many cereals and high-fiber hamburger buns. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has developed something called fluffy 
cellulose to serve as a non-caloric fiber replacement for flour. Derived from 
sugar beet pulp or other agricultural byproducts, it can replace up to half the 
flour in cake or bread. 
</P>
<P>
There appear to be no risks involved with such products, according to experts 
in the nutritional benefits of fiber, although some note that excess fiber 
could limit absorption of important dietary minerals in a person with a 
marginal diet. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, many nutritionists are skeptical about fiber supplements. They advise 
consumers to rely instead on naturally high-fiber foods. Some say it is not 
clear that the health benefits of high-fiber foods such as fruits and 
vegetables come solely from the fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consume fiber in food, you consume a whole range of nutrients," says 
Barbara Schneeman, a professor of nutrition at UC Davis. "If you select some of 
these fiber supplements, you may not be getting the whole package of 
nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of fiber are being sold out there," Labuza says. "We don't really 
know whether (some) perform the function people think they perform, and if 
taking them out of one food and putting them in another they would still have 
the same function." 
</P>
<P>
One check on the proliferation of some engineered foods so far has been the 
ability of manufacturers to market their products. Outdated regulations on food 
composition have made some companies reluctant to manufacture nutritionally 
improved foods. 
</P>
<P>
But food producers insist consumers are often slow to change, too. 
</P>
<P>
They say many Americans raised on the taste of high-fat foods are often 
unwilling to accept nutritionally improved versions -- particularly since fat 
accounts for much of the tenderness, juiciness and flavor of meat and dairy 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost in the minds of these dairy companies is taking out the fat 
but making sure it tastes good," says Robert Boynton, executive director of the 
Dairy Institute of California. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't do any good if you give them a product that's low in fat but 
doesn't deliver. That's really the challenge: How you make products that are 
good for them but still appealing?"

<P>
The most controversial area of food engineering is the one that remains 
farthest from fruition: The use of biotechnology to grow frost-proof fruits, 
durable tomatoes, high-protein beans -- even cows that produce low-fat milk. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists throughout the country are exploring the possibility of using the 
newly developed techniques of genetic engineering to improve the convenience, 
profitability and, occasionally, nutritional attributes of traditional foods. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no such foods are on the market. But the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration is reviewing four applications to sell enzymes, for use in food 
processing, that have been developed through recombinant DNA technology. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques, first developed in the 1970s, involve transferring genes from 
one species to another. Researchers hope they can use those techniques to 
introduce desired traits into crops and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the studies: Scientists are exploring the possibility of enhancing the 
methionine content of beans and the lysine content of corn. Methionine and 
lysine are important amino acids that are deficient in those crops. Enhancing 
the contents of those acids would improve the plants' nutritional value. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is attempting to alter the genetic structure 
of wheat to improve the size and shape of loaves of bread. The aim is 
convenience, but USDA scientists say it is conceivable they might later 
consider nutritional improvements as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes genetically engineered to ripen on the vine without turning mushy are 
being tested for eventual marketing. Researchers are also exploring the 
possibility of altering the genetic makeup of dairy cows to produce low-lactose 
or perhaps low-fat milk. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely how such products would be regulated remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials say that whether an artificially altered gene is a food additive 
subject to FDA scrutiny has yet to be determined. If it simply enhances an 
enzyme already inherent in the food, it may not fall within the FDA's 
jurisdiction, one FDA official says. 
</P>
<P>
James Maryanski of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition says 
there are "some concerns" with genetically manipulated foods -- for example, 
the risk of inadvertently increasing levels of natural plant toxins that could 
be harmful to humans. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things you have to realize is that food is not completely safe," 
says Maryanski, the center's coordinator for biotechnology. "Plants have many 
substances that allow them to defend themselves against disease and other 
adverse conditions." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely the concern of Jack Doyle of the Environmental Policy 
Institute in Washington. He and other skeptics fear that misguided "monkeying" 
with plant and animal genes could lead to "nutritional erosion" and other 
dangerous complications. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Doyle cites efforts in the 1960s to produce a better chipping 
potato through traditional cross-breeding, which does not involve genetic 
engineering. The breeding unintentionally altered the makeup of the potatoes in 
question, rendering them inedible and forcing their withdrawal from 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, there may be genetic baggage that comes in with genes from 
other exotic species," says Doyle, director of the agriculture and 
biotechnology project. "We need to really pay attention to inadvertent changes 
in nutritional characteristics." Janny Scott

First, the good news: They work. The Nutri/Systems, the Jenny Craigs, the 
Optifasts, the Weight Watchers and all the rest of the parade of mass-market, 
enrollment-style diets currently on the American scene. Sign up, stick with it 
and lose weight. If you're faithful, it's virtually guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
More good news: They're not considered dangerous. Stay within the doctor's 
guidelines and the diet's strictures and you'll likely stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable catch: The real world. Real meals. Real food. Actual day-to-day 
eating without diet counselors, group support, weekly meetings, prepackaged 
foods or strictly limited calorie intake. Going it on your own in the world of 
restaurants and dinner parties and seemingly limitless food choices.

"These diets all have some really positive points about them," says Bettye 
Nowlin, a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the American Dietetic 
Assn. "They all use behavior modification and all have an exercise component, 
and you need both of those to be successful. But they're not realistic in the 
long term. People aren't going to keep up these systems all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Still, say medical and diet professionals, the current crop of diet plans, many 
of which have appeared only in the past decade, are far superior to their 
gimmicky or ill-advised antecedents that emphasize practices such as food 
combining, single-food diets, fasting and other questionable weight-loss 
strategies. The newer diets, which shun such oddities and often recommend or 
require close medical supervision and sound, basic nutrition, have little 
relation to fad diets such as the nutrient-deficient Last Chance Diet that was 
briefly popular in the 1970s and was blamed for several deaths. 
</P>
<P>
But the new diets are playing for high stakes -- the enrollment-style diets are 
estimated to be a multibillion-dollar industry -- and each offers a distinctive 
"hook" to attract the approximately 100 million overweight Americans. The maxim 
of the diet biz in the late 1980s remains: You gotta have a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
The enrollment-style diets fall into three basic types: 
</P>
<P>
Liquid, or supplemented fast, diets. These plans typically are medically 
supervised, either by the dieter's personal physician or one designated by the 
diet facility. The regimen involves an initial period of abstaining from solid 
food and subsisting on the low-calorie, high-nutrient liquid supplement. A 
normal, balanced diet is then gradually reintroduced during a period of 
counseling and behavior modification. Optifast and the Cambridge Plan are 
typical examples. 
</P>
<P>
Prepackaged food diets. Dieters are provided with full menus of prepackaged, 
low-calorie foods that they prepare themselves. There are periodic group 
meetings and behavior modification classes with diet counselors. The 
Nutri/System and Jenny Craig plans belong to this category. 
</P>
<P>
Low-calorie, "real food" diets. Participants attend meetings, behavior 
modification classes and group support sessions while adhering to a specified, 
varied low-calorie diet incorporating foods available at a grocery store. Diet 
Center and Weight Watchers are examples. 
</P>
<P>
All the diets, however, have one thing in common: claims of long-term success. 
The responses of medical and diet professionals to those claims is equally 
consistent. They say that, in most cases, they aren't true. 
</P>
<P>
"(The diets) are, I think, fairly successful in the short run," says Albert 
Marston, a professor of psychology at USC who specializes in the study of diet 
and weight control. "All diets see good weight loss at the beginning. The first 
problem people face is the loss of motivation after several weeks. They get 
bored with the food or frustrated with not eating. The really big problem is 
getting people all the way down to their goal weight." 
</P>
<P>
Marston says studies he has conducted have shown that dieters reaching their 
goal weight "have a far better chance of keeping the weight off. If they drop 
out before that, the tendency is to gain (the weight) back." 
</P>
<P>
(Claims by the diet plans notwithstanding, independent medical and nutrition 
experts interviewed say 90% or more of dieters are likely eventually to gain 
all or a portion of their lost weight back.) 
</P>
<P>
For those who do reach their goal weight, says Marston, other pitfalls lurk. 
While all the enrollment-style diets emphasize behavior modification and 
counseling in proper nutrition and the psychology of eating, "they try to get 
people to come back for maintenance (programs), but once people leave the diet 
they tend to think of it as history," Marston says. "Attendance at follow-up 
meetings is generally very poor, and that's a time when people need to be very 
careful. Because when they slip, the attitude tends to be, 'Oh, I've blown it.' 
They have a kind of fall-off-the-wagon attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Dieters are less likely to suffer that slip if good eating habits are 
emphasized from the very beginning of a diet, says Ann Coulston, a research 
dietitian at Stanford University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The two diets I would consider the best," she says, "are Nutri/System and 
Weight Watchers, because they provide participants with real foodstuffs rather 
than liquid drinks. They're learning how to eat less, which is what they're 
going to have to do for the rest of their lives. When you start out like that 
from the beginning, you have more time to help them learn to change their 
behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
"All the liquid nutrition diets go to weight maintenance at the end of the 
treatment, which includes real food. But by that time, a lot of the 
participants have dropped out. In 8 to 12 weeks, they've been on liquid only 
and they haven't learned to eat in a different manner. It's a difficult thing 
to achieve, and you don't achieve it with one or two weeks of instruction and 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Liquid diet programs such as Optifast "try to teach people about proper eating 
when they're not eating," says Marston, "and that makes it more difficult to 
retrain them." 
</P>
<P>
Most diet professionals interviewed say the Weight Watchers program was the 
least regimented and therefore probably the most effective of the diet plans. 
It is also the oldest, having been in business since 1963. Apart from the 
plan's longevity and history of success, Coulston says, Weight Watchers 
"provides an option of several levels of caloric intake. They don't force 
people into very low-calorie diets. They rely on a good balance of regular 
foods." 
</P>
<P>
Weight loss under the Weight Watchers plan is far more gradual than the quick 
loss that accompanies liquid diets, which helps to establish better eating 
habits, says Coulston. However, she adds, there are traps. 
</P>
<P>
"When you use real foods (as part of a diet) and portion them out for yourself, 
you can more readily go overboard and maybe take a double portion." 
</P>
<P>
This also can be a drawback of the prepackaged food diets, says Nowlin, for it 
is possible that once dieters stop eating the prepackaged food "and start 
eating their own food, this is where the breakdown can occur." 
</P>
<P>
Also, say diet experts, a plan that does not include exercise is doomed. All 
the enrollment-style diets provide exercise recommendations but, Marston says, 
actual exercise classes at the diet centers usually are not included "for 
liability reasons." 
</P>
<P>
It is exercise, says Grant Gwinup, a professor of endocrinology at UC Irvine, 
that is one of the ultimate determiners of permanent weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
"More important than all the diets," he says, "is the outflow of energy that 
can only be accomplished by an aerobic exercise program. People are unlikely to 
be successful unless they change their life style and become very physically 
active. That's a fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
Another fact of life in the diet business is show biz, for there is nothing 
like a good testimonial to put the spurs to a few thousand more overweight 
potential clients. Phones at Optifast centers around the country rang for days 
after talk show host Oprah Winfrey revealed a new size-10 figure, courtesy, she 
said, of Optifast. And celebrities such as Elliot Gould and Susan Saint James 
tout other plans in television and print ads. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the advertising is misleading," says David Heber, the director of the 
Clinical Obesity Center at UCLA Medical Center. "They use people in the ads who 
have lost 100 pounds or more. Then they'll say that weight loss will vary with 
the individual, but I don't think that lets them off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
There is also what Heber calls "a disturbing trend in some of the 'shopping 
center' programs such as Jenny Craig and Nutri/System, the lay-directed 
programs" to market ancillary items such as food scales, measuring cups and 
books. Weight Watchers, he says, also markets a line of frozen foods and other 
food products available in grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Marston says, "there has, in general, been a great improvement in the 
dieting industry. It's gotten more and more sophisticated and has been 
providing better service. Like every business, there's always that effort to 
strike a balance between concern for the dieter and a need to make a profit, 
but even physicians could be accused of that." 
</P>
<P>
Is there an ideal diet? That question can start diet experts arguing like 
economists. To Heber, a clinical program closely supervised by a physician, 
tailored to each individual's specific diet needs, is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"The weight-loss population is so heterogeneous," he says, "and people have 
such individual problems, that if they find the wrong program they'll keep 
looking for another until they succeed. Anyone who has the ability to do so 
should participate in a medically supervised program, one that offers a number 
of pathways for people to take depending on how much they want to lose and the 
time they want to spend, with maybe a program with strictly whole food or 
strictly meal replacement or any combination of the two where you can adjust 
the calorie intake weekly. But not everyone can afford such an ideal program." 
</P>
<P>
To Gwinup, the ultimate diet is no diet at all. Like other experts, he 
acknowledges that many dieters -- numerous but usually undocumented in surveys 
-- simply decide to eat less, eat right and exercise more. And often they 
succeed once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other dietitians and eating authorities, however, Gwinup says any 
regimen that deviates from the less-food-more-exercise model is nothing more 
than window dressing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as a magic diet," he says. "Any diet that's deficient in 
calories will make you lose weight. But generally speaking, the closer the diet 
is to real foods that you buy in the grocery store, the more likely you are to 
be successful in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"Although every diet is advertised to make you lose weight, if you're not 
prepared to put up with hunger, forget it. People have to be taught to stay 
hungry. If you can say that you're hungry, you can say that you're burning body 
fat. If people did that, they would not have to do anything else in the short 
run. It's uncomfortable, and my patients hate me for it, but you have to be 
realistic with them." 
</P>
<P>
Mass-market diet plans, Gwinup says, "are selling their patients dreams. It 
doesn't make sense, putting the patient on something very artificial. Forget 
all that lead-in business with gimmicks and let's get to the real stuff. Real 
food." 
</P>
<P>
Such a self-administered diet should be most people's first choice, Marston 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I would do it in steps. First, I would try to do it on my own, because I think 
the more independent we are with these problems, the more effective it is. If 
that didn't work, I'd go to the diet programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the problem is more severe and the person has had no success with those 
common programs, they should go to the physician-monitored programs with more 
intensive care. The care and cost levels escalate depending on the trouble 
you're having. Most people will have to shop around." 
</P>
<P>
After the diet drinks, however, and after the flavor enhancers and the 
sugarless candy and the prepackaged food and the low-cal frozen entrees and the 
nutritional supplements, one great dieting truth emerges: In the end, they're 
all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"What people do ultimately," Heber says, "is eat the same diet to maintain 
their weight in the long term -- a low-fat, high-fiber diet. Ultimately, 
everybody's on the same diet."

ENROLLMENT DIET PROGRAMS AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
NUTRI/SYSTEM 
</P>
<P>
After an initial round of interviews, goal-setting and counseling, participants 
are put on an 800- to 1,200-calorie-a-day diet consisting of prepackaged foods 
that can be prepared at home. During weight loss, participants meet weekly with 
counselors. Periodic meetings are offered after goal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
Average weight loss of 2 to 2 1/2 pounds a week. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
No definite figures available. Cost will rise with the amount of weight 
participant needs to lose. Prices also vary from center to center because each 
operation is an individually owned franchise with fees set by the owner. 
Acknowledged to be generally higher in price than the similar Jenny Craig plan 
(see below). 
</P>
<P>
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Food is easy to obtain and prepare. The program also offers a guarantee that if 
participants do not reach their goal weight on schedule, Nutri/System 
facilities and services may be used free until the goal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
DISADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Lack of exposure to actual grocery store food during weight-loss phase. Cost of 
prepackaged food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
JENNY CRAIG 
</P>
<P>
Similar to Nutri/System, with a program using prepackaged foods and daily 
calorie totals of around 1,000. When dieters lose half the weight they intend, 
they may gradually introduce their own food choices into the diet regimen. 
Weekly counseling and behavior modification classes are held during the 
weight-loss phase, and periodic follow-up visits to centers are encouraged 
after the weight is lost. Strenuous exercise is discouraged during weight loss. 
Specially constructed programs for adolescents also are offered. 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
Average weight loss of approximately 1 1/2 to 2 pounds a week. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
Varies by region of the country, between $185 and $235 for use of facilities 
and services. Prepackaged food is extra, costing between $65 and $70 a week. 
Once goal weight is reached, participants pay a $99 fee to cover maintenance 
program for one year. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Prepackaged food eliminates temptation in grocery stores. Weight loss is 
guaranteed by a set date or further use of the program and materials is free. 
</P>
<P>
DISADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Cost of prepackaged food. Lack of exposure to grocery store food. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
CAMBRIDGE PLAN 
</P>
<P>
A liquid-diet regimen incorporating 800 or 420 calories a day in the form of 
drinks, soups or dessert bars. The 800-calorie plan -- the regular program -- 
is based on three daily servings of the liquid formula, plus 400 calories of 
prepared frozen foods and other lean recipes. The 420-calorie, or fast start, 
program, incorporates only the liquid or bar diet and is designed for those 
with relatively little weight to lose or who want to lose weight quickly as a 
preparation for entering the regular program. The physician-monitored program 
(monitoring is done by participants' personal physicians) uses only the liquid 
portion of the regular program and a small amount of lean or snack foods. It is 
recommended for those with 30 pounds or more to lose. Behavior modification 
program is self-administered with workbook and audio cassettes. Meetings are 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
Average weight loss of 2 to 5 pounds a week on the regular program, up to 15 
pounds in two weeks on the fast start program and 16 to 20 pounds in four weeks 
on the physician-monitored program. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
About $120 a month with an initial investment of about $62. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED 
</P>
<P>
No. Personal physician monitors liquid-only program. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Quick weight loss. Lack of strict regimentation. 
</P>
<P>
DISADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Primarily due to low calorie count: Occasional initial temporary side effects 
such as headache, diarrhea, frequent urination, fatigue, cold intolerance, hair 
loss, constipation, dry skin, nausea, decreased libido and dizziness. Problems 
in adapting to solid food after liquid-only phase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
OPTIFAST 
</P>
<P>
Participants drink only a nutritional supplement, which provides 420 calories a 
day, for the first 12 weeks of the diet. In the following weeks, lean foods are 
gradually reintroduced into the diet and participants attend nutrition and 
behavior-modification classes (this phase lasts until goal weight is reached). 
Continuing classes and group meetings are available, as well as counseling on 
nutrition and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
An average weight loss of about 85 pounds by the end of the program 
(participants must be at least 30% above ideal body weight to qualify for 
acceptance into the program). 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
Roughly between $3,000 and $5,000 for one year. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Close medical supervision, fast weight loss, counseling. 
</P>
<P>
DISADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Primarily due to low calorie count: Possible temporary hair loss, dry skin and 
intolerance to cold during the liquid-only phase. Problems in adapting to real 
food after liquid-only phase. High cost. Time commitment required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
DIET CENTER 
</P>
<P>
A five-phase program, beginning with a two-day transition from present diet to 
leaner foods and some dietary supplements in tablet form. The second phase, 
which lasts until goal weight is reached, incorporates lean foods and 
supplements totaling around 1,000 calories and requires daily supervision and 
weigh-ins. The third, or stabilization, phase allows slightly higher calorie 
totals and a wider variety of foods, without supplements, and lasts a maximum 
of three weeks. The maintenance phase incorporates weekly consultations for one 
year. Weekly classes in nutrition, behavior modification, exercise and stress 
management are offered throughout the program. 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
Average weight loss of between 17 and 25 pounds in six weeks. If 50 pounds or 
more need to be lost, counselors consult with participants' personal physicians 
at each 40-pound loss interval. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
For a loss of approximately 30 pounds (average time: 9 weeks), $700. This 
includes the cost of the stabilization program after the weight loss and one 
year of maintenance. Franchises are individually owned and prices will vary 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
No prepackaged foods, fasting or liquid-only regimens. Foods used in program 
are obtained by participants at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
DISADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Daily commitment to weigh-ins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
PRITIKIN PROGRAM 
</P>
<P>
Not a diet plan per se, but a regimented program designed to reduce risks of 
cardiovascular and other disease through diet and exercise. Residential 
programs at the Pritikin Longevity Center in Santa Monica (other centers are 
located in Florida and Pennsylvania) emphasize low-fat, high-carbohydrate 
eating, medical evaluation, counseling and exercise. Participants live and eat 
at the facility for 13 or 26 days. A six-week, non-residential program called 
Pritikin P.M. also is offered (three evening classes a week for six weeks). 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
Average weight loss during the 26-day program is 13 pounds. On Pritikin P.M., 8 
to 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
The 26-day residential program costs $7,541; the 13-day program costs $4,456. 
Pritikin P.M. is $1,075. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICALLY SUPERVISED 
</P>
<P>
Yes. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Close medical supervision. Intensive education. Supportive atmosphere. May be 
covered by medical insurance. May be tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
DISADVANTAGES 
</P>
<P>
Highly regimented eating plan; limited foods. High cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
WEIGHT WATCHERS 
</P>
<P>
Flexible program in which participants adhere to a prescribed, varied diet 
based on the four food groups. Varied menus -- none below 1,000 calories a day 
-- allow participants to use grocery store food or Weight Watchers frozen meals 
(also available at grocery stores). Quantity and variety of food increased with 
progress of diet. Weekly optional group meetings and individual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
EFFECTIVENESS 
</P>
<P>
Varies, but dieters who are faithful to the program can lose about 2 pounds a 
week or more. 
</P>
<P>
COST 
</P>
<P>
Varies with individually owned franchises, averages about $7 to $8 a week. 
One-time registration fee of $12 to $25, depending on franchise.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to see why doctors are so taken by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Apart 
from providing a way to avoid repeated exposure to X-rays, which carry an 
accumulating risk (albeit slight) even in small doses, it reveals aspects of 
the body that can't be visualized by the most sophisticated CT scanners. It 
shows the subtle differences between the brain's white and gray matter. It 
reveals the smallest lesions in the spine and brain stem. It is fast becoming 
the method of choice for detecting herniated disks, knee injuries and tiny 
blood vessel blockages. 
</P>
<P>
MRI is especially useful in neurological examinations. At Huntington Medical 
Research Institutes, Dr. William G. Bradley reports that nearly a third of 
patients over 60 who had undergone cranial scans at his unit showed indications 
of vessel blockages in the brain, yet they displayed no external sign of any 
problem. Such "mini strokes," as Bradley calls them, are unlikely to have been 
picked up by a CT scan. (Don't say "cat" scan; using that abandoned term will 
mark you as a medical illiterate.) 
</P>
<P>
MRI can also detect small tumors and other abnormalities of the central nervous 
system, which until now could only be revealed by biopsy -- a surgical probing 
that doctors and patients understandably prefer to avoid when the suspect 
tissue happens to lie within the brain or spinal cord. It can also resolve very 
faint areas of inflammation in the brain, such as those associated with viral 
encephalitis, a sometimes deadly disease if it isn't caught soon enough. An 
especially compelling demonstration of MRI's diagnostic power is its ability to 
spot, at a very early stage, the minuscule brain plaques that are the mark of 
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the central nervous system . 
Though MS can't be cured yet, early detection can lead to a more comfortable 
management of the disease with the help of drugs to ease some of its symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of MRI's advantages, however, CT scans aren't likely to disappear 
soon. They remain the preferred diagnostic method for certain skeletal 
disorders such as arthritis because X-rays are better able to visualize the 
knots of calcification characteristic of that ailment. They also retain an edge 
over MRI in diagnosing changes in blood flow caused by arterial blockages or 
bleeding in the brain. And scans work more rapidly and are much less expensive 
than MRI. A CT unit can be purchased for a few hundred thousand dollars, a 
fraction of an MRI unit's cost. The difference is reflected in the bill for 
each service. A typical X-ray session runs from $200 to $300, while an MRI 
workup can range from $600 to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, many doctors feel the extra money may be well spent. Apart from 
sparing the patient exposure to X-rays, MRI often identifies illnesses earlier, 
thereby avoiding the expense of further tests, and sets the stage for quicker 
treatment, increasing the chances of success. And for smaller hospitals 
reluctant to foot the full bill for acquiring an MRI unit, there is a 
money-saving alternative. They can share with like-minded hospitals a mobile 
unit, such as GE's MAX scanner. Resembling an outsized Winnebago, these 
MRI-systems-on-wheels come self-contained with magnets, computers and dressing 
rooms. The unit pulls into a hospital's parking lot, plugs into the power 
supply, cranks up its magnets and, in short order, starts receiving patients. 
When the unit is finished with the hospital's patient load, it moves on. . 
</P>
<P>
One such mobile -- shared by five hospitals in Cape Cod, Mass -- was recently 
observed in action at the Falmouth, Mass., community hospital. As patients 
entered the van, most weren't aware they'd stepped outside the hospital walls. 
An airport-type docking gate had been installed at the rear of the building to 
accept the unit. The patients had been shown a film on MRI or had been told by 
their doctors what to expect. The technicians simply reminded the patients to 
remove anything sensitive to magnetic fields, such as credit cards, mechanical 
watches, even intrauterine devices (IUDs) and false teeth. (Loose metal objects 
can become dangerously hurtling missiles if they're caught in the magnet.) 
Anyone with a pacemaker or other type of ferromagnetic material in his body, 
such as joint pins and surgical clips, would automatically be excluded. So 
would pregnant women, unless the doctor deemed the examination essential; even 
though there is no known risk to the fetus, physicians are cautious in their 
use of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Not all people take to lying quietly in what may seem like medicine's version 
of a culvert. The first patient turned out to be severely claustrophobic. Only 
minutes into the examination, she insisted on leaving the machine. The 
technicians complied. "We never compel a patient to stay," explains Dr. James 
Condon, head of the hospital's five-man radiology group. About 5% of patients 
who undergo scanning discover they can't tolerate the confines for the hour or 
so it takes to do the imaging. Frederic Golden

A TELLING TALE OF MEXICAN REVOLUTION SPARKS ROW OVER WHO'S DOING THE TELLING

<P>
"The Old Gringo" is a novel by Carlos Fuentes, a movie by Argentine director 
Luis Puenzo -- starring Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck -- and an occasion to dwell 
on the way Mexico tells its story to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which opened in the United States this past week, has already sparked 
a new and lively version of the age-old debate in Mexico about what is wrong 
with American, supposedly stereotypical portrayals of the nation and its 
people. As one might expect, it has rekindled the nation's never-ending 
discussion about whether those Mexicans who know how -- and want -- to share 
their vision of the country with foreigners in general, and Americans in 
particular, are traitors, fools, or -- more reasonably -- marvelous decrypters 
of Mexico's code of fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody tells the story of Mexico to Americans the way Fuentes does. In his 
maturity as a writer he has partially devoted his talent to an often 
unrewarding task: translating Mexico and the rest of the hemisphere into 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes always had a gift for interface. His first three novels, which many 
still consider his best, told disbelieving Mexican readers the story of what 
their adolescence in small provincial towns ("The Good Conscience"), their 
capital ("Where the Air Is Clear") and their revolution ("The Death of Artemio 
Cruz") had all become. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes taught an entire generation of midcentury Mexicans about the country 
they really lived in. He is now striving to teach end-of-century Americans 
about their neighbors -- across the river, but increasingly across the tracks. 
"Gringo Viejo," the movie, is not strictly Fuentes' -- he did not write the 
script -- yet in a sense it is his most ambitious, and successful, attempt to 
achieve this end. It is a story deeply rooted in Mexico about the lives, loves 
and death of Americans in the Mexican Revolution, told in a way that can catch 
the American imagination. 
</P>
<P>
But the film is also a set of impressions of Mexico, historical and 
present-day, as Fuentes thinks Americans should see it. Like other Latin 
American intellectuals, Fuentes has achieved a certain balance in the 
presentation of his country and continent, of its history and customs. He is 
not complacent with Americans, telling them what they want to hear. Nor does he 
lecture them, resorting to the moralizing or paternalistic tones that often 
drive many citizens of the United States to distraction. But he does have a 
message, a vision of Mexico that he wants Americans to share, a message that he 
believes they should receive instead of any other. 
</P>
<P>
The result, in "The Old Gringo" and in many of Fuentes' other contemporary 
writings (including the just-translated "Christopher Unborn"), is a rough, 
proud, highly nationalistic and frequently anti-American, deeply introspective 
yet brash Mexico that clashes with other images that Americans are familiar 
with. Fuentes' tour de force is twofold: It consists of presenting this real 
Mexico, and doing so in a way that does not turn Americans off to the country 
and its people. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, while a box-office success, the film has been damned by some as a 
"gringada" -- a typically Americanized, Hollywood production with all the 
stereotypes that many Mexicans consider demeaning. The scenes that most 
infuriate Mexico's right-wing, nationalistic keepers of the faith are 
undoubtedly those of the violence and debauchery the Revolution wrought: the 
taking of the Miranda Hacienda, the horse in the mansion and bedroom, the 
macabre death dance in the cemetery, the prostitute accompanying the 
revolutionaries on their adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The film's critics have let their xenophobia reach new extremes, blaming the 
the movie's inevitable Hollywood traits on director Puenzo's Argentine 
nationality, on Fonda's political leanings or on Fuentes' success along the 
U.S. lecture circuit. They have also complained about the film's constant 
association of its main participants with trains: They ride on trains, sleep 
and make love on trains, do business on trains and are invariably hanging 
around trains. But this is the way Mexico's revolutionaries liked to be 
photographed, the way they posed, the way the Casasola Photographic Archive of 
the Revolution depicted them. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Revolution was the supreme violent episode in a notably violent 
country. Mexico was and continues to be a nation of pent-up, fully justified 
and unending anger against unfathomable injustice, inequality and authoritarian 
abuse. The Mexican people respond to the drama of their existence in 
alternating fits of resignation and rage; their proverbial violence is not a 
stereotype, but a reality. So are many of the other traits of national 
character that the film depicts, in its own, avowedly Americanized fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Thus one of the film's heroes, Gen. Thomas Arroyo, gets into trouble with a 
subdued Pancho Villa (played by Pedro Armendariz Jr.) because he decided to 
stay at the Miranda Hacienda more or less indefinitely. Why did he settle down 
in that marvelous, entirely out-of-place mansion? For the most Mexican of 
reasons one could imagine: He made a friend (San Francisco journalist Ambrose 
Bierce, played by Peck) and fell in love (with Harriet Winslow, played by 
Fonda). And more profoundly, the hacienda was where his mother, a servant, was 
raped by the oligarch himself. Arroyo was born of that violent encounter, and 
in his simple vision of the world, by prolonging his stay and sleep on the bed 
of the crime, he was avenging his mother's violation. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bierce's view of Mexico and the Fonda character's magical Mexican 
rejuvenation are stereotypical -- yet not far from the perception Mexicans have 
of why Americans come to their country. In one of the film's best lines, Arroyo 
explains to his friends from the north: "Now I know why Americans come to 
Mexico: They can't stand each other." In fact, Bierce learns how to die and 
Jane Fonda learns how to love in Mexico, fields in which Mexicans believe 
themselves miles ahead of their puritanical Protestant neighbors. Certainly 
since Malcolm Lowry and D.H. Lawrence, Mexico's fascination with death and its 
rituals have escaped few informed Americans, but the obsession with -- and 
beauty of -- death in Mexico dates back many centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In its own way, the film brings out the difference: Bierce comes to die in 
Mexico, and learns that there is a better way to do so than the one originally 
reserved for him north of the Rio Grande. Like any country or people, Mexico 
has its vanity. Carlos Fuentes and the film reflect it well. 
</P>
<P>
There is a price to pay for Fuentes' gift of interface. Unavoidably, the 
trade-off is unfair, but real. The better Fuentes is at telling his country's 
story to Americans, the greater the distance between that story and the 
official one Mexicans tell themselves. The more accessible the same story is 
for Americans, the more stilted or even corny it can seem to nit-picking, 
superficially nationalistic Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
This is the underlying explanation for many of the recent attacks Fuentes has 
been subjected to in Mexico, as well as many of the friendships and loyalties 
he inspires. The critics come from the darkest, most conservative side of 
Mexico -- the same groups who believed journalist Alan Riding betrayed his 
Mexican friends' trust by writing a best-selling book ("Distant Neighbors") 
about the country he worked in for a decade. The supporters have a different 
origin: They spring from pride in having someone like Carlos Fuentes tell their 
story to an all-important neighbor, and in having it told as splendidly as it 
is in "The Old Gringo."

LOS ANGELES CASE-STUDY HOUSES: WHEN SHELTER WAS AN ART FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Esther McCoy, Esther McCoy is the author of five books on California 
architecture, including Case Study Houses 1945-1962 (Hennessy and Ingalls) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The show of Case-Study Houses opening at the Museum of Contemporary Art on Oct. 
17 is a blueprint of a long-past age of faith. 
</P>
<P>
The show revivifies Arts and Architecture magazine's program to build model 
houses that would light the way between historic and modern styles, under the 
direction of the late John O. Entenza, editor and publisher. The purpose was to 
furnish critically needed housing for the returning soldiers and for the 
thousands of war workers who had flocked to Los Angeles -- and stayed. What was 
available at the end of the war was hastily constructed housing and the 
run-down houses of the '10s and '20s. 
</P>
<P>
In the late-19th Century, Los Angeles had become a vacation spot. Visitors put 
up single-wall housing, open to the studs, often with no plumbing and without 
indoor cooking arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with San Francisco, Los Angeles was more of a throwaway city, perhaps 
because San Francisco was a presidio where boats -- to and from China, and from 
around the Horn -- called in. Los Angeles was a pueblo with little wood and few 
basic materials, most of which were sent down by coastal boats from San 
Francisco. The fact that San Francisco was more sophisticated and looked to the 
East and Europe for its style may account for the listing of Arts and 
Architecture in English bibliographies as based in San Francisco. Perhaps it 
was hard for the English, even in the '60s, to believe that anything as urbane 
as A&amp;A could come out of rough-and-ready Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1910s and '20s Los Angeles was a more permanent place to live and steady 
population growth begat colonies of single-family cottages dotted over the raw 
land. New settlers built in styles prevalent in the regions from which they had 
come. The most popular material was wood, originally in short supply in the Los 
Angeles Basin. This was mud country. Pueblo building was in adobe; wood had to 
be imported from San Bernardino or shipped down from San Francisco and was used 
only in beams, windows and door frames. 
</P>
<P>
Construction almost stopped in the '30s during the Great Depression. Then, 
during World War II, there was a great deal of building for defense facilities 
but materials and square footage were limited for civilians. Meanwhile, toward 
the end of the Depression new ideas about the American house had been evolving. 
When building as a handcraft was seen to be dead as a dodo, technology was 
courted. To produce with less material and less hands was the goal. Architects 
R.M. Schindler and Richard Neutra had models of houses which, if not high-tech, 
were at least in part repeatable. By the end of the Depression and the 
beginning of the war, most students in architectural schools had at least one 
attempt at low-cost housing on their boards. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was being set for a new approach to housing. Los Angeles was 
attracting architects with ideas. 
</P>
<P>
There was one publication in the area, California Arts &amp; Architecture, 
devoted more to decoration than to architecture. But the magazine was failing. 
When it came up for sale, Entenza, the guest editor for several issues, bought 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He soon took California off the title, restricted it to modern design and gave 
it an international focus. 
</P>
<P>
Arts and Architecture did more to put Los Angeles on the cultural map than any 
other artifact. Architects in many countries later testified to the influence 
it had on them as students. One was Cesar Pelli, who said A&amp;A was the 
magazine that most students in Argentina waited for. After the war, when I was 
in Japan, an architect and critic told me that as a defeated nation, the thing 
that gave Japanese architects the faith to go on was Arts and Architecture. And 
it was known in Europe for the good modern architecture it showed. As a layman, 
Entenza had unerring taste. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine was the rallying point for design in Los Angeles. The Depression 
years and the war years had given architects little to do and many had left the 
profession for allied fields. 
</P>
<P>
As the war was winding down, A&amp;A decided to sponsor a group of case-study 
houses and put them on display. The goal was to acquaint the potential small 
homeowner with the modern style. Even before the war, model houses were being 
shown. They were usually in borrowed styles and sprang up around the city, 
running the gamut from the cottage with wood scallops around the window to the 
stucco chalet. With the same floor plan, one could have a ranch style, New 
England saltbox, French Provincial, Spanish Colonial or you-name-it pasted on 
the same framing. Cars lined up to see them. But one designed by Neutra was 
built of new exterior plywood. At the end of the showing it was bought by 
Stella Gramer, the law partner of Entenza's father, and she moved it to 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The Case Study program gave architects free rein to experiment with plans, form 
and materials for two-bedroom houses that were self-sufficient, requiring no 
maid or gardeners. The war had brought about a major social change; when large 
numbers of women went into defense work, there was a dearth of servants. So the 
house and gardens had to be designed to take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Entenza asked a few architects he respected if they had clients in need of 
small houses. If the designers would put their projects on display for a month, 
equipped and furnished, manufacturers would provide top-of-the-line products at 
the price of their cheaper lines. 
</P>
<P>
Many architects Entenza would have included had no such clients. The younger 
postwar architects were usually the ones who had clients that fitted the 
program. Case Study Houses were to be built and sold for occupancy. Inflation 
at the end of the war prevented building some of the houses; other were 
delayed. A shortage of materials, frozen during wartime or in short supply for 
civilians, persisted even after the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
The first house to be shown was J.R. Davidson's, which had a roof truss, 
allowing for a long span and few interior walls. Although there were no halls 
in the house, the circulation pattern was clearly defined. Many Case-Study 
exteriors did not show the exploration inside. Architects were as interested in 
the unbuilt as in the built; the house by Ralph Rapson had a "road" down the 
center of the floor plan and all the rooms opened on to it. The road was the 
social area. An unbuilt design by Whitney Smith was entered through a garden 
lath house. 
</P>
<P>
The program was successful -- so successful that it was extended and young 
postwar architects were favored. 
</P>
<P>
The studies took a new turn in 1949; the framing was steel, as in the Charles 
and Ray Eames house and the Rafael Soriano houses. Further explorations in 
steel were designed by Craig Ellwood and Pierre Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
Several changes in the larger housing picture were drawn from the A&amp;A case 
studies, including bringing the outdoors indoors with planting and sliding 
glass doors. The three Case-Study Houses built on one parcel in La Jolla, 
designed by Edward A. Killingsworth, taught land-use lessons. So did a new 
approach to grouping houses in the San Fernando Valley, an unbuilt project for 
Eichler Homes designed by the late A. Quincy Jones, with homes below grade and 
the earth turned up into grassy berms. 
</P>
<P>
When John Entenza moved to Chicago to direct the Graham Foundation, he sold the 
magazine to David Travers, who carried the case studies into apartment design. 
But by the 1960s housing had become an industry. Commercial builders were 
incorporating ideas from case studies into enormous housing tracts; the 
experiment had served its purpose.

NEW NORTH-SOUTH HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several years in which relations between Mexico and the United States 
ranged from testy to downright unfriendly, it is refreshing to report that last 
week's state visit by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was decidely upbeat. 
More importantly, Salinas' talks with President Bush laid the groundwork for 
future cooperation in two areas of vital concern to both nations -- trade and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The most noteworthy achievement at the summit was an agreement to begin 
negotiations aimed at reducing trade and investment barriers between the two 
countries. That's always a good place to start, because even when Mexico and 
the United States have been estranged politically, they have been pulled 
together by their mutual economic dependence. Mexico is the third-largest 
market for U.S. goods and sells 75% of its exports to this country; trade in 
both directions totaled $44 billion last year alone. Mexican labor helps keep 
many U.S. farms and factories going. And most economists agree that foreign 
investment, particularly from the United States, will be needed to help revive 
Mexico's economy from its recent recession. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the trade talks could lead to a "significant 
evolution" in trade relations between the two nations. Because of the disparity 
between their two economies, the United States and Mexico are still a long way 
from signing a free-trade agreement like the one recently signed between this 
country and Canada. But the planned negotiations should help lower the tariffs 
and other barriers that keep Mexican goods like auto parts and winter crops out 
of the United States. They could also lead to further revisions of the 
nationalistic laws that keep non-Mexicans from investing in Mexico. And a 
healthier Mexican economy would relieve the United States of concern about 
political unrest south of the border, and could help slow the movement of 
Mexican illegal immigrants to this country. 
</P>
<P>
On the environmental agenda, Bush agreed to send U.S. experts to provide 
technical advice to officials struggling to reduce air pollution in Mexico 
City, whose air is even dirtier than that of Los Angeles. And Salinas agreed 
that Mexico would cooperate with U.S. efforts to reduce water pollution along 
the border, a particular problem in San Diego, where beaches are sometimes 
dirtied by untreated sewage from Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
There are still some areas of disagreement. While pledging to cooperate with 
the Administration's highly touted war on drugs, Salinas said Mexico will still 
not let U.S. law officers, or this country's military, operate in Mexican 
territory even when they are in hot pursuit of suspected smugglers. And, like 
other Mexican presidents before him, Salinas criticized this country's 
treatment of Mexican migrant workers, telling Congress to "get rid of myths" 
that illegal aliens take jobs from U.S. citizens. So, obviously, the summit was 
a success because both presidents chose to focus on the issues they could agree 
on while putting potential disagreements aside. But if the formal agreements 
they signed help bring the two "distant neighbors" closer, the subjects they 
disagree on could be easier to deal with in the future.

U.S. AND U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's Sept. 25 address to the U.N. General Assembly ("Bush Offers 
Cut in Chemical Arms" and related stories, Part I, Sept. 26) signals a new 
American recognition of the value of an effective United Nations in helping the 
United States and other nations achieve their foreign policy goals. Yet for 
several years, the U.S. unilaterally cut its assessed contributions by one-half 
as a way of pressuring the U.N. to adopt fiscal and administrative reforms. Now 
satisfied that the reform process is under way, the Reagan and Bush 
administrations have requested Congress to approve near full-funding. 
</P>
<P>
However, still at issue are $460 million in arrearages that have accumulated 
over the past five years. The Senate Appropriations Committee has rejected an 
initial first-year down payment of $46 million. For $460 million -- a fraction 
of the cost of one B-2 bomber -- the United States could help re-establish its 
role as a leader at the United Nations and provide much needed support for 
essential and cost-effective actions that benefit all Americans.

THIRD-WORLD DEBT AND POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the column "Stop Starving the World's Poor to Pay Debts" (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 
25) an international coalition of legislators really spelled out the tragic 
results of Third-World debt burdens -- the unnecessary deaths of 500,000 
children last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in developing nations the very people loans are supposed to benefit 
are hit the hardest when these debt-choked countries must tighten their 
economies to make the interest payments. What are the first things to get cut? 
Social services like rural health care clinics, immunization programs, schools, 
and food subsidies. Unemployment rises and, as usual, the poor suffer and 
children die needlessly from hunger. 
</P>
<P>
That's why it's critical that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund 
adopt proposals that borrowing nations must direct loans to: 
</P>
<P>
1. Improving child mortality and female literacy. 
</P>
<P>
2. Focusing on programs that directly benefit the poor. 
</P>
<P>
3. Targeting the economic productivity of the poorest 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a country's effort to comply with the three proposals must be a major 
criterion for further loans and debt reduction.

CONTROVERSY OVER CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the capital gains fiasco, the majority of Democrats and Republicans have 
at last shown their true faces and made it abundantly clear that, in order to 
maintain their seats in Congress, they intend to cater to the rich and 
powerful. All, of course, at the expense of us poor and middle-class citizens 
and taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The eloquent and grandiose phrases and speeches about the uplifting of the poor 
and the minorities, the quality of life in general, and the overall betterment 
of mankind are just grist for the mill. 
</P>
<P>
Although historically third parties have had little political success in this 
country, perhaps it is time to try again! For with the recent past and the 
present leadership in both parties, we are in serious danger of rendering our 
democracy useless and sinking to a fourth- or fifth-rate status as a nation and 
as a world power.

THIRD-WORLD DEBT AND POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time has passed when we can ignore the poverty of other nations, treating 
it as "their problem." The scale of the issues of the world's poor extends its 
impact to all countries. It is in the best interests of everyone, including the 
worldwide banking community, to find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
As indicated in the column, the World Bank and the IMF are in a position to 
reorder priorities and dramatically change policies which could benefit, 
ultimately, not only the financially disenfranchised but the financial 
institutions as well. Structural adjustments which focus on reduction of 
poverty lead to stability and a quality of life which enhances business 
opportunities while it upgrades global conditions in every sector. Everyone 
wins!

 -- I don't understand the reasoning behind yellow watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most dangerous cars on the road are the ones with pizza delivery signs 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Get out your checkbook. If the number on the upper right corner of your 
checks is four digits or more, you are a very stable person. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How come America has no circular or triangular states? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I will never understand people who actually buy the videotapes of movies. 
How could you possibly watch one movie enough times to make it worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let's admit it: The risk-free, much less expensive Voyager missions have 
provided much more valuable data than our very risky, enormously expensive 
manned space flights. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you want to be sure you will never see the waiter again, tell him you 
need "just another minute" to look over the menu. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 -- I firmly believe that were it not for Lean Cuisines, most bachelors would 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you missed the "Later With Bob Costas" one-year anniversary show, you 
ought to write NBC and get them to show it again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Given the state of electronics today, I don't see why refrigerators can't 
sniff the food and tell you when it's gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maybe the new motto ought to be "If You Drink, Don't Walk." According to 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, about a third of the 7,000 
pedestrians killed in traffic accidents last year were drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is Woodstock over? Can we come out now? 
</P>

principle.

eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take those boxes of Christmas decorations off the Ping-Pong table! 
According to the University of California, Berkeley, Wellness Letter: "For 
average players, a swift game of singles table tennis burns about 350 to 450 
calories per hour, about the same as brisk walking, doubles tennis, golf (if 
you carry your bag), or cycling at 6 to 8 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

for some reason canned water seems awfully silly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why America Will Always Be Numero Uno, Example No. 612: Colored plastic

</P>
<P>
 -- I'd like to see a tire guarantee that really meant something. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How come nothing in Ripley's Believe It or Not is the least bit 
unbelievable anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 -- There's nothing as stale as a stale fortune cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do kids still do woodburning? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I don't care what they say, the commercials ARE louder than the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When's the last time you heard a really good yodeler? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I think it is utter nonsense that Jimmy Hoffa is buried in Giants Stadium. 
Everybody knows that Jimmy Hoffa is currently Elvis' road manager. 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Bush had to stage a drug-buy to get the crack he held up on TV? 
He must be the only person in Washington who has difficulty getting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When's the last time you saw a woman wearing a hat?

</P>
<P>
 -- A bowl of popcorn is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment there is.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 -- You can tell a lot about a man by whether he keeps his wallet in his left 
or right rear pocket. 
</P>
<P>

her crude remarks. But what's to boycott? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is this the worst new TV season ever or what? 
</P>
<P>
 -- I think the most spectacular feat in sport is when Bo Jackson breaks the 
bat across his knee. I'll bet you a broken leg you can't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Call me old-fashioned, but I just can't get used to the concept of 
microwave watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles Dickinson's "The Widows' Adventures" is written so beautifully you

points.)

We tell ourselves about the problem, examples are given and we show the 
results. But no one seems to proffer a solution or even a suggestion of one. 
Are we hopelessly and inexorably bound toward a nation divided by race? If that 
is the only answer then what was experienced 25 years ago will be nothing 
compared to the violence ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The question of race will never be totally eradicated. That's a constant. 
However, we can ill afford to ignore the alternatives. We must instruct our 
children and we must not quit in our effort to solve this dilemma.

STEVEN'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Who Was Steven" (Sept. 22, by Paul Dean): An abduction by a stranger 
by whom he was repeatedly sexually molested over a period of seven years robbed 
him of his childhood innocence. A tragic motorcycle accident recently robbed 
him of his life. Some people never get an even break in life. Steven Stayner 
was definitely one of those people. Hopefully he has now found tranquility and 
peace of mind. After the miserable life he has gone through, he certainly 
deserves it.

STEVEN'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Who Was Steven?" recounted the story of a young man who had his 
innocence and boyhood stolen from him in the cruelest kind of way, who, as a 
teen-ager, was determined that the same thing wouldn't happen to the newest 
victim of kidnaper Kenneth Parnell, and who was willing to take whatever risk 
was necessary to get little 5-year-old Timmy White safely away from the abuse 
Steven had endured for seven frightening years. 
</P>
<P>
Life has dealt Steven and the Stayner family one harsh blow after another. The 
hard time he had "getting his feet on the ground" is to be expected after all 
he went through. He had a lot of strangers pulling for him, from one end of the 
country to another, and his sudden death in an accident on Sept. 16 has left a 
deep sadness in many hearts. 
</P>
<P>
What the story didn't mention was that Steven was a hero. It probably isn't an 
easy burden to carry but that's what he was to many of us, and that's the way 
he will always be remembered.

SIENA, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two huge flowered balloons lifted us gently from the dew-wet grass of a 
valley meadow, through a primordial mist and into a place of sunlight and 
silence. Somewhere far below we could hear dogs barking but couldn't see them. 
We were like an airborne bouquet suspended between a dazzling blue heaven and a 
fog-shrouded netherworld. 
</P>
<P>
I could almost hear my Sienese friend and guide Lucia Coppi saying: "See, it's 
just like I told you. In Siena, the sacred and the profane are always mixed up 
together." 
</P>
<P>
One by one, from nearby hilltops, castles and villas poked their towers out of 
the clouds as if to take a look around. Swirls of mist lay snagged like chiffon 
in the tops of trees. 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, the rose-red city of Siena materialized as if by magic, rising 
through the clouds like some medieval saint's fervent vision. First visible was 
the slender brick Mangia Tower that crowns the town hall, then the baptistry 
tower of the striped cathedral. Next came the cathedral's glistening white 
dome, and, finally, the rosy tiled rooftops and reddish-pink walls that define 
the color that artists call burnt sienna. The tower hovered in the distance 
like an apparition, tantalizing as a hallucination. Then, like smoke, the mist 
began to slip away. 
</P>
<P>
While we stood in our baskets in awed silence, the invisible dogs began barking 
in counterpoint. We could feel the heat from the flame overhead and hear the 
throaty roar of the burner as Mike, the pilot, directed a burst of hot air into 
the huge silken balloon, and we climbed a bit higher, above our friends in the 
balloon behind us, for a better look at the medieval city that lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Ballooning provides a special viewpoint for some of the earth's extraordinary 
places: Kenya's Masai Mara during the migration of the wildebeests; the 
snow-covered Swiss Alps in winter; the architectural splendor of the Loire 
Valley chateaux and Austrian castles, or the vineyards of Burgundy during the 
autumn harvest. Most ballooning excursions are seasonal and sell out quickly, 
so plan and make reservations well ahead. 
</P>
<P>
There were 10 of us in the six-person rattan baskets on this balloon adventure 
in Tuscany, all, by coincidence, from Southern California. We were a real 
estate developer and his wife, two interior designers, an actor, a theatrical 
agent, a retired businessman, an energetic and spunky octogenarian who was 
making her fourth ballooning excursion and two writers. 
</P>
<P>
When my wake-up call came that morning and I looked out the hotel window into 
the gray, misty pre-dawn, my heart sank. We certainly would not be able to fly 
on a day like this. 
</P>
<P>
But we were told that test balloons showed there was a good chance of finding 
winds to carry us over the city. Still half-asleep, we mumbled greetings to 
each other and tumbled into two chase vans, each pulling its own balloon 
squeezed into a wicker basket mounted on a two-wheeled trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere on the outskirts of Siena we turned onto a series of roadways that 
got progressively narrower until finally, on a dirt road little more than a 
track, we stopped to inflate the balloons in a damp, foggy field. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the air, as we drifted closer we could see the city sprawled across its 
three red-clay hills in an irregular shape that looked something like an 
ancient animal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the world quite like Siena," art historian Bernard 
Berenson wrote. "It is a medieval city that might be likened to a rare beast, 
with heart, arteries, tail, paws and teeth. Only the skeleton is left intact, 
and it is enough to astound us." 
</P>
<P>
On this exhilarating morning, it seemed to resemble the Chimera from Etruscan 
sculpture with the head of a lion, the horned head of a goat growing from his 
back and a serpent for a tail. 
</P>
<P>
Siena, more than anywhere else in Italy, is a place still living 
unself-consciously and comfortably in the rich golden afternoon of the Middle 
Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Siena hit its stride about the middle of the 13th Century, when it defeated 
archrival Florence in the battle of Montaperti. The city grew and prospered for 
100 years until the Black Death decimated medieval Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Siena then closed its city gates to the Renaissance that two centuries later 
struck Florence with a fever of creation. But not Siena. It was forever fixed 
in its own time -- the late Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Sienese artists continued to paint in stylized Byzantine and Gothic flatness, 
ignoring the new Florentine passion for perspective. And in 1555, the 
Florentines conquered Siena, something the Sienese don't like to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sienese don't want to change," my friend Lucia had said with a sigh the 
day before, when we had coffee together in the campo. "They like to have always 
the same things; otherwise they are scared." 
</P>
<P>
From the balloon I could look down to where Lucia and I had sat in the tilted, 
shell-shaped piazza, and I wished she were still there so I could call down and 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, my impulsive "Buon giorno!" from overhead startled workmen who were 
removing packed, golden dirt from the track laid down for the Palio, which had 
taken place a few days before. 
</P>
<P>
The famous Palio is an odd combination of medieval spectacle and fierce, 
violent horse race that has been run each summer since the 11th Century. Twice 
a year, July 2 and Aug. 16, dirt is brought from its storage place outside town 
and tamped down around the perimeter of the piazza to make the parade route and 
race track. 
</P>
<P>
Some scholars think the Palio may have come from the Etruscans, mysterious 
early settlers of the region who were obliterated by the Romans but who gave 
their name and certain arcane and cabalistic customs to the present-day 
Tuscans. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Etruscans who first developed strong city-states similar to the 17 
contrade, or districts, in Siena today. 
</P>
<P>
The contrade, most of whom were named for animals, probably began in the Middle 
Ages as neighborhood military companies. 
</P>
<P>
Today they function as extended families that compete in the Palio. They also 
bring a sense of family and neighborhood responsibility to life in Siena. The 
district in which a baby is born determines his contrada, and despite where he 
moves for the rest of his life, he will always be known for the name of his 
animal contrada, whether it is Owl or Eagle or Unicorn. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows each other," Lucia said. "If you don't behave in a certain way, 
you are pointed out. In a contrada, if a young person is not happy with his 
life, if he is going to get in trouble with drugs or something, everybody tries 
to help him. Otherwise, the honor of the contrada would be ruined." 
</P>
<P>
There is said to be virtually no crime or gang activity in the city. Perhaps 
this is due in part to each person's intense loyalty to his contrada, which 
includes bonding behavior, such as wearing colors and the insignia and shouting 
expletives against rival districts during the frenzied days of the Palio. 
</P>
<P>
From ground level I had never fully appreciated the way the campo is neatly 
divided into nine herringbone-brick wedges that become a fan with the points 
radiating downhill -- a practical design element originally intended to channel 
away rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, the shadow of our balloons brushed across the Mangia Tower, and I 
could see the pigeons around the rim of a green square of water, the Fonte Gaia 
or Fountain of Joy. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow medieval streets below, restricted to foot traffic, wound tortuous 
and intricate routes shadowed by the steep old buildings that line them, until 
they burst, dazzlingly, into the brilliant clarity of the campo. 
</P>
<P>
"In other cities, when you want to meet someone you telephone and make an 
appointment," Lucia said. "Here, you go to the campo, to the cafes, and you 
always find who you are looking for." 
</P>
<P>
The campo stands almost equidistant between the sacred and the profane, the 
cathedral and the Monte dei Paschi bank. The latter, founded in 1472 and housed 
in the graceful Palazzo Salimbeni, has been the heartbeat of Siena for more 
than 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
Half the profits of the bank go to the city (last year the total was 40 billion 
lira). A local saying defines the three kinds of employment in Siena: having a 
job at the bank, being retired from the bank and waiting to get a job at the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
From the balloon the stripes of the cathedral appear to be the same black and 
white as the colors of Siena -- the polarity between light and darkness, good 
and evil. But up close they are dark green, the marble tinged with copper. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the duomo it is possible to see the Facciattone, the ghostly skeleton of 
the "new" cathedral that opened its doors in 1330 to show how rich and powerful 
the Sienese had become. Then came the plague of 1348, which killed nearly 
two-thirds of Siena's population of 60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Workers and master masons died and all building stopped, never to be started 
again. It still is open to the sky, as are green parks and spaces where wooden 
houses -- which rotted or burned -- once stood. Today the population within the 
walls of the city is about 30,000, half of what it was in the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Just before our balloon returned to the 20th Century by setting down in the 
soccer stadium, we soared over the vast, stern Church of San Dominico, where 
relics of St. Catherine of Siena -- her shrunken, leathery head and a thumb -- 
are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
A local dyer's daughter and one of 23 children, Catherine entered the Dominican 
order in 1360 at the age of 13, scourging herself with whips and fasting with 
an anorexic's passion. 
</P>
<P>
The pale, bone-thin nun, depicted holding a spray of white lilies in one of the 
many paintings of her in Siena, nursed countless victims of the plague of 1374 
without ever becoming ill. 
</P>
<P>
Her contemporaries considered that a miracle. Some latter-day scholars have 
suggested another explanation: that long-term exposure to vast amounts of 
tannin found in dyes may have protected her. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in the Goose contrada, St. Catherine is Siena's patron saint. 
And therein lies what Lucia calls a typical Sienese story: 
</P>
<P>
"There was a priest -- he is dead now -- who used to wear the colors of the 
Goose under his robes. He really wanted the Goose contrada to win the Palio 
race, so every day he lit candles in front of St. Catherine. The day of the 
Palio came, but the Goose did not win. So this priest, he came back to St. 
Catherine and he put out all the candles and said, 'Just for that, you stay in 
the dark!' "

LONDON

<TEXT>
<P>
The ghost of Virginia Woolf hangs lightly over Bloomsbury. A blue plaque on the 
wall of a building in which she once lived is all that remains to tell of her 
life here. 
</P>
<P>
There are no homes to visit, no museums and no shrines either to her or to 
other members of the literary "group" that once stirred and shocked English 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
What remains are the squares of Bloomsbury, each a green retreat from the 
pressures of the city. Despite the ravages of World War II and development, 
these squares are very much as they were in Woolf's day. 
</P>
<P>
Some are oblong, others round. A few could even be called square. Surrounded by 
iron fences, for the most part they are tree-lined parks. Gateways lead to 
numerous benches where one can rest and contemplate the daffodils of spring, 
the blooms of summer or the falling leaves of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Around these squares the Bloomsbury Group clustered in the 1920s when, as one 
writer said: "A handful of young, generally lovely, extraordinarily talented 
Londoners decided to change the world and . . . in stunning measure succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
Bloomsbury is bounded by Euston Road on the north, Southampton Row to the east, 
New Oxford Street on the south and Tottenham Court Road to the west. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starting Underground 
</P>
<P>
We found that a good place to start a walking tour of the area was from the 
Russell Square underground station, easily reached from any part of London. 
</P>
<P>
Before setting off we took our bearings from a London street map while sipping 
a cup of coffee at a cafeteria in a corner of the square. With outside tables, 
the cafeteria offers light snacks and is open every day from 10 a.m. to 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Running north from Russell Square is Woburn Place, a heavily traveled way 
filled with buses, taxis and traffic-dodging pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes we reached Tavistock Square. Woolf and her writer-editor 
husband, Leonard, came to this square in March, 1924, to live at No. 2 
Tavistock Square, in the basement of which Hogarth Press had its beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
Destroyed during World War II, the site is now occupied by the Tavistock Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Circling the square, we passed the Jewish Museum. Across the road is the 
blank-faced front of the British Medical Assn. building with its plaque 
announcing that Charles Dickens once lived there. While staying here between 
1851 and 1860 Dickens wrote "Bleak House," "Little Dorrit" and "Hard Times." 
</P>
<P>
We moved on, but not before a guidebook made us aware that on that same site 
two brothers fought a duel over a woman who watched both of them die. Legend 
says that their 40 paces remained imprinted in the ground and no grass has ever 
grown on them. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Square was next on our itinerary. The first to discover the square were 
Woolf (then Virginia Stephen), her sister Vanessa and her brothers, Thoby and 
Adrian, all of whom moved into No. 46 in 1904 after the death of their father, 
Sir Leslie Stephen. 
</P>
<P>
At Cambridge, Thoby befriended Leonard Woolf, Lytton Strachey, who was to 
revolutionize the art of biography, and Clive Bell, a rising art critic. 
</P>
<P>
They all ended up in Gordon Square. Others who became part of the group were 
economist Maynard Keynes, painter and critic Roger Fry and artist Duncan Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Gordon Square is not the most romantic of the Bloomsbury squares," Virginia 
Woolf wrote later. "It is prosperous, middle class and thoroughly 
mid-Victorian. But I can assure you that in October, 1904, it was the most 
beautiful, the most exciting, the most romantic place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Today Nos. 46, 50 and 51 are owned by London University, which uses No. 50 as 
its Careers Advisory Service central office. We walked into the office and 
asked if it were possible to view the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that there is nothing to see," the office manager said. "There once 
were some murals here by Duncan Grant, but they disappeared during a 
renovation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographic Reproductions 
</P>
<P>
We walked to Woolf's former home at No. 46, where we learned that although no 
tours of the building are given, there was a standing exhibition at London 
University's Birkbeck College on Malet Street. 
</P>
<P>
Being close by, we decided to pay it a visit, but were disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Bloomsbury Portraits" and occupying the walls of one corridor, the 
exhibit is little more than uninspiring reproductions and photographs, relieved 
only by two or three original pencil drawings of Bloomsbury figures by Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving -- and casting a glance at the gadget-festooned post office tower that 
punctuates the skyline in this area -- we continued until we reached Bedford 
Square, the most elegant of the squares and one that still retains much of its 
18th-Century charm. 
</P>
<P>
At No. 44 the fashionable London hostess, Lady Ottoline Morrell, held soirees 
for the Bloomsbury Group. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking of lunch, we made our way back toward the Russell Square tube station, 
walking south on Bloomsbury Street and then turning left onto Great Russell 
Street with its booksellers and print shops. 
</P>
<P>
Great Russell Street, which passes in front of the main entrance to the British 
Museum, also has its selection of pubs, including the Museum Tavern in which 
Karl Marx had a pint or two when not studying in the museum's reading room. 
</P>
<P>
Just past the museum on the right is tiny Bloomsbury Square, which gives the 
district its name and which is of interest in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
When built in 1661 it represented a new concept in town planning. The Fourth 
Earl of Southampton put together a complex of buildings around a central park 
with a mansion for himself on one side and houses for the wealthy on the other 
three, all supported by a network of service roads and a nearby market. 
</P>
<P>
The London square was born. Not one of the original buildings remains, but one 
of the present structures was home to Benjamin Disraeli, Victorian British 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
A little distance from Bloomsbury Square we reached the main thoroughfare of 
Southampton Row, which runs south toward Covent Garden and north back to 
Russell Square. While walking north on the right side of the road past an array 
of pizza places we came across Queen Square. 
</P>
<P>
We wandered down a narrow passageway called Cosmo Place, passing first one pub, 
the Swan, and then another, the Queen's Larder. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, notices told us that the latter watering hole was so named because in 
the days when George III (he of unfortunate memory during the American 
Revolution) was being treated for a mental disorder nearby, his wife, Queen 
Charlotte, rented a cellar on the premises to keep a supply of delicacies for 
her spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite the pub stands St. George the Martyr Church, built in 1706 and 
sometimes called the Sweeps' Church because on Christmas Days of old a free 
dinner was given to 100 chimney-sweep boys from the district. 
</P>
<P>
At the corner of the church stands an outdoor flower stall ("bouquets made to 
order") that seemed in an unusual location until we became aware of the nature 
of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding this tiny square are a remarkable collection of hospitals and 
healing establishments -- the Italian Hospital, the Royal Institute of Public 
Health, National Hospital, Institute of Neurology, Royal London Homeopathic 
Hospital; nearby, the Hospital for Sick Children -- such an accumulation that 
Robert Louis Stevenson described the area as being dedicated to the 
"alleviation of all hard destinies." 
</P>
<P>
Walking back up the passageway we stopped in at the Swan, all dark wood and 
pictures of swans abounding. We settled back in one of the Victorian booths and 
ordered a pub lunch. Then we raised a silent glass to Virginia Woolf and all 
the squares of Bloomsbury.

BOYS TOWN IS BOOMING BUT THE MESSAGE REMAINS;

ONE MAN'S DREAM FOR UNWANTED YOUNGSTERS NOW A NEBRASKA LANDMARK 
</P>

BOYS TOWN, Neb. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1921 when a bespectacled young Irish priest used his meager 
savings to buy a 160-acre farm outside Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
After the final papers were signed on a crisp October morning, a group of 
homeless boys packed their scant belongings and headed 10 miles west of the 
city to their new home. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs was a strangely moving procession. Two trucks loaded with worn furniture 
crept at the front. In their wake, under the expansive Nebraska skies, trudged 
125 ill-clad youths pushing wheelbarrels and carrying suitcases. Along Dodge 
Street and past the city limits they plodded. 
</P>
<P>
By sunset the scraggly paraders had bedded down in the "mecca of their dreams." 
Overlook Farm had everything: rolling grasslands, barns, chicken coops, a 
cattle shed, even an ice house. No matter that they bunked in concrete-floored 
wooden barracks, heated by corncob-fed potbelly stoves. 
</P>
<P>
These boys and their leader -- the charismatic Father Edward J. Flanagan -- 
were about to build a "City of Little Men." Before long it would become, 
simply, Boys Town, the home for youths no one wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Now, years later, Boys Town has become a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1917, Father Flanagan had opened the doors of a large Omaha 
rooming house to his first wards: three newsboys and two boys living in the 
streets. Those were difficult days. The harried priest had to borrow $90 for 
the first rent. Three months later the house overflowed with 50 street kids. 
</P>
<P>
Although Overlook Farm provided space to grow in, Father Flanagan remained in 
need of funds. In 1922 he organized a traveling minstrel show. Fifteen boys, 
billed as the "World's Greatest Juvenile Entertainers," toured Nebraska towns 
in four secondhand circus wagons. Wearing cutoff World War I uniforms, they 
sang their hearts out. 
</P>
<P>
The Boys Town of today would almost certainly cause its emotional, soft-hearted 
founder to weep for joy. 
</P>
<P>
A mini-metropolis stretching over 1,300 acres, it contains 98 buildings, 
including a post office, a dairy and horse farm, a greenhouse, a police 
department, a field house, an auditorium, schools and 70 living units -- home 
to more than 500 troubled boys and girls who have been abused or neglected. 
Girls have been admitted to Boys Town since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
A married couple, called "family teachers," leads each home of six to eight 
youngsters aged 8 to 19. The youths cook, sew, do their own laundry, shop and 
plan menus, and learn social skills and how to communicate. Most stay about two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Now a National Historic Landmark, Boys Town has through the years provided 
shelter for more than 16,000 young people. It is one of Nebraska's foremost 
tourist attractions, displaying its good work to about 100,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
I find myself revisiting Boys Town almost like a retreat, seeking once again 
the farm's simple serenity and sense of mission. The lovely landscape is 
permeated by a bucolic sense of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is the abiding presence of Father Flanagan that makes the prairie 
air so radiant. Flanagan died of a heart attack in 1948 at age 62 while in 
Berlin on a mission for former President Harry S. Truman. He was seeking 
remedies for Europe's displaced children. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors stroll the priest's former residence, explore the Hall of History 
museum, pause before the symbolic statue of a youth hoisting a small boy on his 
back, and stop at the Vocational Career Center, where 17 trades are taught. 
</P>
<P>
On campus, the legendary Father Flanagan lived most of his adult years in a 
modest red-brick house with his sister Nellie. She was her brother's personal 
adviser and surrogate mother, as well as a warm and giving homemaker to the 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
The Flanagan house still retains its aura of warmth. Upstairs, Father 
Flanagan's cassock, cape and white-laced surplice rest on his bed. In Nellie's 
room, her wicker chair, sewing machine and personal items are arranged as if by 
Nellie herself. 
</P>
<P>
In the study downstairs sits a six-foot inlaid desk of 39 types of wood. Boys 
from one of the manual training classes made the desk for Father Flanagan. They 
began the tedious task of fitting together thousands of pieces of wood in 1936, 
taking three years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Les Dreifuerst, former youth counselor and longtime guide at Father Flanagan's 
residence, remembers the man whose dream is now a legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The father was full of life," Dreifuerst recalls. "Typically Irish, he flared 
up if kids got into mischief, especially the big ones. But with little guys, he 
was a bleeding heart." 
</P>
<P>
The spirit of the young people who have lived in the home is mostly alive in 
the Hall of History museum. In the foyer, newspaper headlines dramatically 
describe the plight of unwanted children in the early 1900s: "Children Living 
With Pigs," "Boy Tramps Found Worthless Lot," "Parent Would Pawn Boy and Girl 
for $300." 
</P>
<P>
Against this attention-getting backdrop, a lifesize figure of Father Flanagan 
stands with an arm around the shoulders of a boy wearing tattered pants and a 
raggedy sweater. 
</P>
<P>
In the museum, exhibits depict scores of people associated with the City of 
Little Men, from President Truman and actor Mickey Rooney to comic strip 
characters Joe Palooka and Captain Marvel. 
</P>
<P>
An attraction is the Academy Award won by Spencer Tracy for his portrayal of 
Father Flanagan in the 1938 movie, "Boys Town." After the film was completed, 
it was shelved for several months, with Louis B. Mayer, MGM president, 
insisting, "It will never sell, there's no sex!" 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also will see scenes from "Boys Town," as well as from two other 
motion pictures about Boys Town. In addition, home movies about campus life in 
the early 1960s are shown. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Hall of History, moving mannequin displays tell the story of 
Father Flanagan and his boys. One display depicts a runaway boy sleeping in a 
cardboard storage box; pressing a nearby button elicits the story of Billy's 
life in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Another display shows three early Overlook Farm boys shooting marbles, one of 
the few leisure activities the priest could afford for his tatterdemalion 
brigade in the early years. He once sadly said: "Some of the finest people in 
the world go through life handicapped because they never learned how to play as 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The museum's crimson circus wagon is a reminder of those first minstrel shows 
and boy soprano voices. 
</P>
<P>
Also on exhibit is the front half of the old school bus that used to carry Boys 
Town football teams to games. By entering and honking the horn, you can start a 
film of the football games. In the 1940s, Boys Town football teams rolled over 
opponents across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Museum displays also introduce today's family living program. "My Room" is an 
exhibit showing a typical corner of a young resident's room: a desk, a closet 
full of clothes and a bureau with a mirror. Look into the mirror. You see 
yourself. But the mirror "talks" at the push of a button above it. Alternating 
girls' and boys' voices tell their stories: 
</P>
<P>
"This is my room at Boys Town. I didn't always live here, but my parents used 
to fight a lot and sometimes they hit me. I've run away. In my room I study and 
pray and take care of my clothes and work on projects I like to do. Sometimes I 
get lonely. We come from places like your hometown and your neighborhood. We 
could even be you." 
</P>
<P>
A Hall of History tour ends quietly with a brief videotaped message from the 
current director, Father Val Peter, quoting from Father Flanagan: "The work 
will continue, you see, whether I am there or not, because it is God's work, 
not mine." 
</P>
<P>
A fitting end to a Boys Town visit is the Dowd Memorial Chapel and Father 
Flanagan Shrine, where a marble and bronze vault contains the beloved priest's 
tomb. Embossed on the tomb are the Irish leader's most famous words: "There are 
no bad boys. There is only bad environment, bad training, bad example, bad 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Boys Town is about 10 miles west of Omaha on U.S. 6 (Dodge Street). A visit 
should begin at the Visitors Center, which, along with the Hall of History and 
Father Flanagan's residences, is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., except 
Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day and Good Friday afternoon. Dowd 
Memorial Chapel is open daily. 
</P>
<P>
Self-conducted tours of Boys Town can be taken all year. The Visitors Center 
has maps and tape recordings explaining what to do and see on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Personally guided tours by Boys Town teen-agers are available hourly from the 
Visitors Center in June, July and August, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. All Boys 
Town attractions, including tours, are free. 
</P>
<P>
Points of interest include the Music Hall, which houses band and choir practice 
rooms; the Boys Town High School and Wegner Middle School; the Field House, 
which has a trophy case near the entrance; the Roe Garden, adjacent to the 
Father Flanagan House, plus the Vocational Career Center, Dairy Farm and Hall 
of History. 
</P>
<P>
The Boys Town choir sings on Sunday at the Dowd Chapel 10:30 a.m. mass. There 
are also masses at 8 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. Protestant services begin at 9:15 a.m. 
at the Nativity Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
The Visitors Center has a cafeteria (open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m.), souvenirs and a display of stamps and coins. The most unusual item 
is a 600-pound solid ball of stamps that has been featured in Ripley's Believe 
It or Not. The ball is 32 inches in diameter and consists of 4,655,000 used 
stamps. Nine boys constructed it in 1974. It took them nine months. 
</P>
<P>

HER WORLD: TRIPPING THROUGH THE SIGHTS OF AMSTERDAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, author of California (with photographer Dewitt 
Jones), is a travel writer based in La Jolla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I lay sprawled on a gravel path in Amsterdam, I thought I must have been 
mugged. 
</P>
<P>
But my shoulder bag seemed to be intact, as was my shoulder. I sat up, reached 
for my sunglasses. They were bent from the fall, but unbroken. 
</P>
<P>
A tall Dutchman leaned over me, casting a shadow. He asked if I would like 
water. I started to say, "No, thanks," but I was too baffled to speak. "Don't 
move," he said, and stepped to a food-to-go kiosk in this park near the 
Rijksmuseum. 
</P>
<P>
The cup of cold water was refreshing. My head was beginning to clear. The 
Dutchman kicked an outsize pebble from the path, the rock that may have tripped 
me. Then he offered his arm. 
</P>
<P>
With pride askew but my trench coat untorn, I stood and waved goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"We never considered naming you Grace," my mother once said as she bandaged my 
knee in fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
I may not tell her what I put that knee through on the Museumplein of 
Amsterdam. (Yes, I had on sensible walking shoes. No, I was not running. Maybe 
I was looking up at the Van Gogh blue sky instead of the ground at my feet.) 
</P>
<P>
Mildly battered, I marched on. I was determined to continue walking in a city 
that treasures its 17th-Century architecture. Amsterdam even boasts of an 
official yard where surplus antique doors and window frames can be bought to 
replace worn-out originals. 
</P>
<P>
The modern era has been less kind. Many walls of the once-scrubbed city are 
blackened with graffiti. Drugs are tolerated and obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Still, life seems to go on much as it has. Under the vast tiled arches of the 
Rijksmuseum a flutist was playing "Bolero." It echoed amid the whoosh of 
trolleys and the clamor of backpackers. Wall posters of a sunny-yellow tulip 
marked the 40th anniversary of Kuekenhof Gardens near the country town of 
Lisse. 
</P>
<P>
But on this day I would not leave the city. I would concentrate on central 
Amsterdam, the maze that spreads from Dam Square and is ringed by horseshoe 
canals: from Singel, the innermost, where one house is no wider than a door; to 
Prinsengracht, known for the Anne Frank house and the Westerkerk church, where 
Rembrandt is thought to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the Westerkerk tower is a golden crown and orb that glimmers through the 
branches of chestnut trees in the garden of the Hotel Pulitzer, a clutch of 
refurbished canal-front houses. 
</P>
<P>
I have spent restful days under those gabled roofs, but this time I merely 
walked through the lobby to remind myself of its charm, and then wandered back 
past its courtyard, art gallery, bar and small restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant glows with candlelight, polished brass and cane-backed chairs. 
White cafe curtains flutter in the windows. Tables are bright with fresh 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
I paused for coffee and pastry and to toast a stubborn, savvy judge who is a 
pal of mine. The judge was staying at the Pulitzer a while back, but shunned 
dining there because of his conviction that adventurous travelers should never 
settle for meals in their hotels. ("Too many tourists," he proclaimed, as he 
fingered his passport.) 
</P>
<P>
So off he went at dusk to explore the neighborhood and find a place ripe with 
atmosphere. He ambled past bobbing houseboats moored on the Prinsengracht and 
crossed an arching bridge near a barge decked with bikes and geraniums. 
</P>
<P>
Finally he found what he sought on a corner of Keizersgracht canal. The food 
was good, the conversation low-key, the mood friendly and local. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner he asked a waiter for directions back to his hotel. The young man 
opened a door that led to a labyrinthine hall, a bar, a courtyard and a 
gallery, and then the Pulitzer lobby. 
</P>
<P>
This was the hotel's Petit restaurant -- on an opposite corner of the block -- 
candles, cane chairs and all. His Honor did laugh, although he still swears by 
his method. 
</P>
<P>
In that same neighborhood I paused with two college students to read the menu 
posted at the Cafe Mexico at 188 Prinsengracht. Tapas, tacos and the specialty 
-- pollo loco -- were described in Spanish, English and Dutch. I felt the need 
for a small salsa fix, and Amsterdam is notably tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered a chicken taco with guacamole and a tall glass of local brew -- the 
great Heineken beer. I relaxed and stretched my aching knees, and pondered the 
next day's trip.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: ELEVATOR TRANSPORTATION HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone once asked the legendary writer James Thurber why so many writers 
seemed to stay at the Algonquin Hotel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't come here as writers," he deadpanned. "They became writers while 
waiting for the elevator." 
</P>
<P>
Few things anger travelers more than having to wait -- and wait -- for an 
airplane, a taxi and, yes, even for an elevator. The hotel elevator is one of 
those things travelers ignore . . . unless it's slow. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the worst cases are at large convention hotels, where elevators 
apparently were designed and built for the number of rooms but not for the 
number of people in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Other bad elevators can be found at older hotels that have been expanded 
without the addition of much-needed elevators. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotel elevators are bad because hotel owners have simply waited too long 
to upgrade and renovate the systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One for the Owner 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, guests at the Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas were 
inconvenienced because the casino owner decided that one of the elevators was 
to be off-limits to guests and would only be used occasionally -- to take the 
owner to his suite. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, waits are caused when elevators are taken out of passenger service 
and used for other hotel departments: the bell staff (to move luggage), 
catering (to move meals) and, in many hotels, certain elevators are blocked off 
in the mornings and used by room service to deliver breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
At the new 1,241-room Hyatt Regency Waikoloa on the Big Island of Hawaii, the 
hotel is part of the massive 31,000-acre Waikoloa Beach Resort. Guests stay in 
any one of three towers. No one has to wait more than 30 seconds for one of the 
high-tech elevators to arrive. The elevators then speed the guests to the 
ground floor of their tower. 
</P>
<P>
But then you have to be patient. To get from each tower to the main lobby, you 
can choose between a 15-minute walk or a 5-minute wait for a 10-minute ride in 
a motorized tram. Yet in most cases, guests don't want a lengthy sightseeing 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
At one hotel, the laws of gravity are severely tested, to the dismay of many 
guests. The elevators at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in New Orleans often disprove 
the theory that what goes up must come down. The glass elevators are still such 
a novelty that excited children delight in pushing all the buttons so they can 
prolong their ride -- and your wait. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when it comes to most hotel elevators in Asia, no one seems to wait. 
</P>
<P>
At the Regent in Hong Kong, the six high-speed Hitachi elevators are constantly 
moving. And the hotel has added a thoughtful touch. When a guest pushes the 
button to summon an elevator, a light switch and tone announce the arrival of 
the specific elevator 15 seconds in advance. This is particularly helpful for 
any guest carrying his or her own bags. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find a bad hotel elevator in Japan. The Ginza Seiyo Hotel in Tokyo 
has about the best elevators I've ever seen or ridden. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a hotel will recognize its elevator shortcomings, only to discover 
serious maintenance problems after installing an expensive, sophisticated 
computerized system. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point: the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, China, once had ancient, manually 
operated elevators. They were slow, and often broke down. But the staff fixed 
them quickly, sometimes with spare parts which they machine-tooled themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a few years ago, the hotel decided to begin an ambitious renovation 
program. An expensive Japanese elevator system was installed, but never 
properly calibrated. Some of the new elevators were even slower than the old, 
and frequently broke down. Even worse, try getting an elevator repairman 
knowledegable about the system on short notice in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
The Drake Hotel in New York is known for good service, friendly staff . . . and 
notoriously slow elevators. "There is no denying it," said General Manager 
Jacques Hamburger. "They are slow. Too slow." 
</P>
<P>
When the hotel is crowded, or in the mornings when many guests are either 
checking out or hurrying off to business meetings, the wait for the 60-year-old 
Drake elevators can be horrendous. 
</P>
<P>
But the hotel is doing something about it. "A hotel prides itself on service," 
said Hamburger, "and the hotel elevator is just as much a part of that service 
as anything else. You might be staying in the best room in town, but if you 
have to wait 7 to 10 minutes to get there, the room suddenly diminishes in 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faster and More 
</P>
<P>
Engineers and special elevator designers will soon rip out all of the Drake's 
old elevators. They will be refurbished with new shafts and cabs, two elevators 
will be added and the system will get faster. Now they move at 300 feet per 
minute. When the $4.2-million job is finished, all the elevators will travel at 
nearly 500 feet per minute. 
</P>
<P>
Old elevators can't always be helped. In fact, they often add to the charm of 
the establishment. Some older European hotels, for example, still have antique 
iron cage elevators that ascend and descend slowly. But when you see one of 
these ornate machines, you almost immediately get in the mood for a nostalgic, 
deliberate trip. 
</P>
<P>
At some hotels, elevators have become conversation pieces -- especially outside 
glass-enclosed elevators, like the $500,000 cliffside Pali Kai elevator at the 
Westin Kauai. It is an engineering marvel built into the hillside to transport 
guests from the hotel to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Or the Summit elevators at the Westin Hotel, Renaissance Center, Detroit. The 
elevators zoom up a glass tube, soaring 760 feet in just 1 minute and 10 
seconds. At the top, and on a clear day, visibility is about 30 miles. 
</P>
<P>
And there still are a few hotels left in America that pride themselves on 
preserving an endangered species: the hotel elevator operators. 
</P>
<P>
A small cadre of veteran elevator operators runs the original Kaestner and 
Hecht cabs at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. The Pierre and the Mayfair Regent are 
two New York hotels that still employ elevator operators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tradition we fight to maintain," said George Schwab, general manager of 
the Pierre. "We have many repeat guests who look forward to seeing their 
favorite elevator operators. It's like coming home. And an elevator operator 
gives our guests an extra measure of security, especially at night. They are 
our additional eyes and ears." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the renovation of the new Mark Hotel in New York, formerly the 
Madison Avenue Hotel, General Manager Raymond Bickson attacked the elevators 
first. They were old. They were slow. New elevators were built, new motors and 
cables installed and a new electrical system put in place. Then Bickson hired 
elevator operators. He even gave them the title of "lift attendants." 
</P>
<P>
When the Mayfair Regent recently spent more than $1 million to renovate its 
elevators, cables and motors, General Manager Dario Mariotti insisted that the 
hotel retain the original elevator cabs and shells, as well as the white-gloved 
elevator operators. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been cheaper to make the elevators automatic," Mariotti said, 
"but it would have detracted from our service. In fact, we didn't even add 
floor buttons inside the cabs, because I didn't want to be tempted to replace 
the operators. Certain traditions are worth keeping. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of it this way: At least the guests still have someone friendly to talk 
to on the way up, or the way down. In New York, that's very important."

THE MATURE TRAVELER

<P>
Jane Parker, who started Retirement Explorations in 1979 as a way to combine 
vacations with research on foreign retirement sites, has a new hot prospect: 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay is sandwiched between Brazil and Argentina on the southeast coast of 
South America. It is one of South America's smallest countries, about the size 
of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay has been called "the Switzerland of South America," partly because of 
its topography, partly because it is more stable than other politically 
chaotic, inflation-ridden South American countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered that one could live an upscale life style there for half of what 
it costs in any of the major U.S. cities," said Parker, a retired 
schoolteacher. "Not only were the economics rosy, but I found the people 
well-educated with a strong middle class, which is warm and friendly to 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"When I visited Montevideo," she said, "I felt I had come to a moderate-size 
European city, not at all what one expects in South America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Literacy Rate 
</P>
<P>
Uruguay is made up mostly of transplanted Europeans, primarily Spanish and 
Italian and their descendants. It has better than a 90% literacy rate among its 
population of 3 million, half of whom live in the capital city of Montevideo. 
</P>
<P>
The result of Parker's inspection is a two-week Retirement Exploration tour 
that combines a visit to Uruguay and Argentina, set for Oct. 28 to Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
It follows the same successful pattern Parker has used for similar 
vacation-retirement inspection trips to Costa Rica, Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Her trips cover the typical vacation highlights, balanced with on-the-spot 
meetings with retired Americans living in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers also will talk to doctors, realtors and other locals, and will be 
briefed by the American Embassy staff. Usually they visit an American retiree's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's tours are not the hard-sell kind. There is no inducement to buy 
anything and no tie-ins with realtors, land developers or time-share and condo 
salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visiting a Resort 
</P>
<P>
Her October tour includes visits to Montevideo and Punta del Este, one of South 
America's most popular summer resorts and retirement home for Americans. In 
addition to meeting with the Americans living in the country, there are other 
sightseeing and two free days. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, there's a week in Argentina, visiting Buenos Aires and Iguacu Falls, 
plus other coastal resorts and other meetings with Americans living in 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
There's more sightseeing, plus five dinners or lunches, first-class hotels, 
tips, airport-to-hotel transfers and retirement meetings and inspections in the 
tour price of $2,590 per person, double occupancy, from Los Angeles, or $1,661 
for the land portion if you wish to make your own South American travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, including background information on Uruguay, contact 
Retirement Explorations, P.O. Box 57-6487, Modesto 95355, (209) 577-4081. 
Information is also available about similar Retirement Exploration trips to 
Costa Rica, Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Murrieta Hot Springs, which has upgraded its accommodations and dining 
facilities while retaining its health and beauty spa treatments, offers a 
special midweek rate for mature travelers through Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Those 55 and over pay $39 per person, double occupancy, per night. Price 
includes breakfast and lunch, plus unlimited use of the mineral pools, saunas, 
tennis courts, aerobics and pool exercise classes. 
</P>
<P>
The resort is just north of Temecula off Interstate 15 at 39405 Murrieta Hot 
Springs Road. For information and reservations, call toll-free (800) 458-4393. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy Suites Hotels in the Southern California area are offering a Suite 
Sunday Club for seniors 55 and older. The plan includes a two-room suite 
complete with two TVs, a refrigerator, a microwave and a wet bar, complimentary 
beverages from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. and a cooked-to-order breakfast the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Cost for two is $69 at the following Embassy Suites Hotels: Anaheim, (714) 
632-1221; Downey, (213) 861-1900; Buena Park, (714) 739-5600; Covina, (818) 
915-3441, and Santa Ana (714) 241-3800. For the Embassy Suites in Arcadia, the 
price is $79; (818) 445-8525. 
</P>
<P>
Those who stay five Sundays during the promotion (until April 30, 1990) will 
get a free weekend stay.

YOUTH BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Youth Hostels has opened a budget accommodation facility in Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The youth hostel is near the heart of the city, on the south shore of Town 
Lake. The renovated building was originally the Old Rowing Club Boathouse. 
</P>
<P>
Now it offers accommodations for up to 40 visitors in single-sex dormitory 
rooms. In addition, there is a special family/couple room with a king-size 
waterbed. You'll also find a fully equipped self-service kitchen and a large 
common room that overlooks the lake. 
</P>
<P>
AYH advises that the location is convenient to parkland hiking and biking 
trails that skirt the lake. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a member of American Youth Hostels the rate is $8 a night. 
Non-members will have to pay an extra $3 a night for an introductory 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Age Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
The AYH network has more than 250 outlets across the United States, and is 
affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation, which has more than 
5,000 outlets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Although the word "youth" is prominent in the name, few areas of the world 
(including North America) impose any age restrictions on using hostel 
facilities. In return for inexpensive accommodations, be prepared for 
single-sex dormitory rooms, having to provide your own sheet sleeping bag and 
being asked to help with a small chore. 
</P>
<P>
For more information or reservations, contact Austin International Hostel, 2200 
S. Lakeshore Blvd., Austin, Tex. 78741, (512) 444-2294. 
</P>
<P>
The British Youth Hostel Assn. has announced the opening of another hostel 
along the 180-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Footpath in southwest Wales. That means 
there are now eight youth hostels along this popular walking route. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the route is in Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, one of 11 national 
parks in England and Wales. The area is known for its wildlife, coastal 
scenery, sandy beaches and cozy harbors. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons you might find yourself in that area is because of a ferry 
service from Rosslare, Ireland, to Fishguard, Wales, that takes less than four 
hours. Student and youth discount fares are available through the Irish student 
travel service, USIT, which has offices throughout Ireland and in London. 
</P>
<P>
The new hostel is at Manorbier a few miles from the popular resort of Tenby, 
which is about 239 miles from London. It's in a renovated building suitable for 
young travelers, the disabled and even families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Footpaths and Walks 
</P>
<P>
The walking season is almost over for this year, but you can get some help in 
planning for next spring through a free publication, "Walking In Britain," 
offered by the British Tourist Authority and the Countryside Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Along with descriptions, the booklet includes maps of 60 established footpaths 
and walks throughout Britain. 
</P>
<P>
England and Wales have more than 135,000 miles of public rights of way, which 
help you avoid the traffic while enjoying the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
You could find yourself being led across a field or through a forest. Many of 
these routes were originally paths used as communication systems before cars or 
bicycles; now they've been joined to form long-distance walking trails. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking In Britain" also identifies youth hostels, and includes information 
about alternative budget accommodations, guided walks, public transportation, 
guidebooks, detailed maps and such practical advice as what to wear. 
</P>
<P>
Free copies are available from tourist information centers in Britain or from 
the British Tourist Authority, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 
90071, (213) 628-3525. 
</P>
<P>
Another good source of information for planning travel in Britain is "Let's Go: 
Britain and Ireland," by the Harvard Student Agencies ($11.95). It's 
re-researched annually, and new editions are usually available in bookstores 
during the Christmas holiday season each year.

CONSUMER REPORT: FLIGHT ATTENDANTS SEEKING FAA HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Suppose you survived an airplane crash, then tried to escape from a window exit 
before toxic gases and fire spread through the plane, but couldn't because of 
limited access to the window access hatches? 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of Flight Attendants is asking the Federal Aviation Authority to come 
to terms with the issue, and cited the British Civil Aviation Authority in 
coping with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Seats are jammed too close to the window exits in the economy sections of many 
American jets, and this can make it difficult for passengers to find a good 
physical position to quickly open and remove the heavy hatches at these exits," 
Matt Finucane, director of air safety and health for the flight attendants 
group, said. 
</P>
<P>
Finucane added that narrow-body planes such as 737s, 727s, DC-9s and MD-80s 
have this problem in coach sections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Problem With Doors 
</P>
<P>
"The wide-body planes such as 747s, DC-10s and L-1011s have doors over their 
wings rather than windows, so getting out of the jets doesn't present this 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finucane also charged that the FAA is delaying in alleviating the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we're accustomed to long delays in FAA rule-making, it is 
unforgivable that it would take the agency more than four years to write a rule 
implementing a known solution to a known problem," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, American passengers remain exposed to a hazard eliminated by the 
British. They're also safer flying on American-made jets in England than in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
An FAA spokesman said the agency is putting together a proposal that might 
change the regulations on access to window seats. The proposal is expected to 
be ready for public comment early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The British action resulted after an Aug. 22, 1985, accident involving a Boeing 
737 taking off at Manchester International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In that accident the takeoff was aborted. Although the first fire vehicle 
arrived in less than 30 seconds, 55 passengers and crew died from fire, smoke 
and toxic gas inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Manchester incident, Finucane said the British in 1986 ruled 
that airlines must make more space for passengers to open such exits, either by 
providing an aisle to the exit, which is forward of the midline of the exit and 
at least 10 inches wide, or removing the seat closest to the exit. 
</P>
<P>
A typical U.S. airplane seat installation has an aisle width of seven inches, 
seats forward of the midline of the window exit, and three seats abreast. "This 
type of installation, while not necessarily used on all American jets, allows 
little room for a passenger to remove the window exit," Finucane said. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to provide adequate access, the aisle width would have to be 
increased at least three inches, as with the British rule. In addition, the 
seat row would have to be moved back so the cushions don't cross the centerline 
of the exit. As an alternative, the seat nearest the exit could be removed." 
</P>
<P>
The FAA is considering a related proposal that would determine who should sit 
in an exit row on domestic flights. This could lead to certain passengers being 
banned from sitting in such rows because of safety considerations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seating Choices 
</P>
<P>
Passengers considered unable to operate emergency exits without assistance, or 
who might impede the evacuation of other passengers, would have to sit 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Flight crews would have to judge, because the proposal would call for the 
carriers to train such personnel, who would have to make judgments about 
passenger capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for the airlines to verify that appropriate passengers 
are sitting in the exit rows before takeoff, and to be responsible for briefing 
passengers on their option of moving out of the exit row if they think they 
can't handle the responsibilities that go with such seats. 
</P>
<P>
The rule by the FAA would call for passengers sitting in exit rows to be able 
to find the exit and follow instructions for use.

WOOD-ROOF BAN DRAWS FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
MAKERS SAY TREATED SHINGLES ARE SAFE, BUT NEW RESTRICTIONS SPUR INTEREST IN 
ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Puente Hills fire that destroyed 13 homes on July 3 came within a mile of 
Michael Rodriguez's wood-roofed house. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was planning to replace his 13-year-old roof eventually, but the fire 
motivated him to do it immediately. "It hurried things up a little because we 
thought we might get another fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new tile roof was not cheap -- it cost $12,000, and the attic of 
Rodriguez's two-story, five-bedroom home in Hacienda Heights had to be 
reinforced to support the extra weight. 
</P>
<P>
He chose a tile roof, because he likes its appearance and its fire resistance. 
"It looks nice and I feel safer too," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Many other Southland homeowners are looking for fire-resistant alternatives to 
their old wood shakes or shingles, especially since bans on new wood roofs 
began in August in Los Angeles and Glendale. Several other areas are 
considering wood-roof restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials who sought the bans cite the danger of wood roofs in a dry climate 
prone to brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
But wood-roof manufacturers are fighting back, insisting that fire-resistant 
versions of their product are safe, and claiming that the new regulations will 
cost homeowners a lot more money. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy spells confusion for homeowners, because even fire chiefs 
disagree on whether the fire-resistant wood roofs offer sufficient protection. 
</P>
<P>
The wood-roof industry is stepping up its public relations efforts to convince 
homeowners that treated roofs are safe, and it is taking legal action as well. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that the bans could start a trend, the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau 
has taken Los Angeles to federal court, charging discrimination, said Michael 
Westfall, president of the Bellevue, Wash.-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to use Los Angeles as a test case before challenging roof bans 
elsewhere in California, its biggest market. Westfall and other industry 
members say fears about wood are based on untreated roofing materials (like 
Rodriguez's old roof), which burn easily. 
</P>
<P>
The industry got a boost last month, when the state attorney general issued an 
opinion declaring that cities do not have authority to impose fire codes more 
stringent than those of the state. The opinion was issued at the request of the 
state fire marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Fire Commissioners asked the city attorney's office to 
draw up a formal response to the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has been developing fire-resistant shakes and shingles since the 
1960s, and they have been widely available since the early 1980s, Westfall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both shakes, which are split and have a textured appearance, and shingles, 
which are sawed for a smoother look, are factory pressure-treated with 
chemicals forced into the wood cells, which should last the life of the roof, 
about 25 to 30 years, Westfall said, depending on weather conditions and 
upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure-treated shakes and shingles cost about 25% more than untreated. The 
association does not endorse any treatments supposed to make existing, 
untreated wood roofs fire resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has required fire-resistant wood shakes and shingles since 1982. 
Other areas also require fire-resistant roofing. The bureau supports those 
requirements and will work with officials to develop acceptable products, said 
Mark Rutledge, marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
However, treated shakes and shingles meet roofing industry standards for fire 
resistance, so it's unfair to ban the products, Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire-resistant roofing materials can be rated Class A (effective against severe 
fire exposure outside the structure), Class B (moderate fire exposure) or Class 
C (slight fire exposure). 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles requires Class B roof coverings, while Glendale requires Class A or 
B, depending on a house's proximity to hillsides. Treated wood roofs are 
available in B and C classifications, and can meet Class A standards if 
installed with gypsum board underneath, Westfall said. Untreated roofs do not 
qualify for a rating. 
</P>
<P>
Treated cedar shakes and shingles have passed Standard 5 resistance tests, 
which require burning wood to self-extinguish on the roof surface, said Jim 
O'Shea, engineering associate at Underwriters Laboratory Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Underwriters Lab, an independent not-for-profit testing service, also subjected 
treated shakes and shingles to extra tests because of concerns about their 
effective life. After 10 years of weathering tests, treated shakes and shingles 
maintained their fire resistance, O'Shea said. Another test simulates 20 to 30 
years of exposure. Treated wood has also passed the flying-brand test, to make 
sure pieces don't break off and start fires on nearby roofs. 
</P>
<P>
That's good enough for Los Angeles County Fire Marshal Jim Daleo. "I can't give 
you one case in the 2,000 square miles we've served where the product has 
failed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Cautious Approach 
</P>
<P>
The county has various roofing requirements for different areas, depending on 
fire danger. In Malibu, for example, all wood roofs have been barred since 
1980, following several fires. Daleo said the county is working on an ordinance 
to require Class C roofs in unincorporated areas where now any type of roof is 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
But other fire chiefs are taking a more cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
In Corona, wood roofs are only restricted along the city's southern border, 
next to the Cleveland National Forest. However, Fire Chief Robert McNabb is 
researching the issue and said he may recommend barring wood roofs throughout 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said he's willing to listen to the wood-roof industry, but so far he 
isn't convinced that treated shakes and shingles are safe enough. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is wood roofs burn," he said. "I think the No. 1 question is how 
long can you guarantee the life of a treated wood roof?" 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city fire officials have similar concerns. "We don't feel they're 
proven to be safe," said Fire Marshal Dave Parsons. "We don't feel the tests 
replicate Southern California weather conditions," including Santa Ana winds, 
he said. "Our major concern is the flying-brand issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look Virtually Identical 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging there isn't much evidence against treated wood roofs, 
Parsons said because the product hasn't been tested for its full life (up to 30 
years), banning them is the best step for fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
Fire chiefs are also uncomfortable with the fact that treated wood roofs look 
virtually identical to untreated wood roofs. How are fire crews to know whether 
wood-topped houses have fire-resistant roofs or not? When faced with a row of 
threatened houses and limited resources, firefighters usually ignore 
wood-roofed houses, which they have little chance to save, and concentrate on 
houses with less flammable roofs, said Battalion Chief Ron Cary of the Hemet 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few things both sides can agree on is that the problem should 
diminish in years to come, as old wood roofs are replaced. Fire officials are 
happy to point out that fewer new homes have wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in Los Angeles County, 67% of new houses had tile roofs and fewer 
than 5% had wood roofs, said Ben Bartolotto, research director of the 
Construction Industry Research Board. Statewide, 55% of new homes had tile and 
20% wood. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Homes, one of the state's biggest builders, uses tile roofs on 90% of its 
new homes in Southern California, said Randall Lewis, executive vice president 
of the Upland-based firm. The rest are lower-priced composition shingle. Fire 
resistance and durability are reasons the company uses tile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Market in Reroofing 
</P>
<P>
Tile is also part of the trend toward higher-priced homes with more amenities, 
and goes with current Spanish and Mediterranean housing designs. 
</P>
<P>
So today the major market for wood shakes and shingles is in reroofing. About 
30% of Los Angeles homes have wood roofs, according to industry estimates. Many 
of those were installed in the 1960s and 1970s, and are nearing replacement 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Even where new wood roofs are banned, shakes and shingles are usually still 
allowed for minor roof repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale requires that old wood roofs be replaced with non-wood roofs if 25% or 
more needs repair, or if a new addition is 25% or more of the original 
structure's size. For repairs of less than 25%, pressure-treated wood must be 
used to give some fire protection until the whole roof is replaced, said Fire 
Marshal Chris Gray. 
</P>
<P>
The 25% figure is cumulative for the life of the roof, so a series of small 
repairs could eventually reach the point where the entire roof has to be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Replacement Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, however, specifies that any wood roof that needs to have more than 
10% of its surface redone in a 12-month period must be replaced with a non-wood 
roof. Lesser repairs can use the same material as the rest of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Additions to existing houses must also have non-wood roofs, although the 
original house roof doesn't need to be replaced unless more than 10% of it has 
been removed, said Robert Harder, assistant chief of the city building bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pyles, office manager of Slater Roof in Los Angeles, said he suspects that 
many city roof repairs will be described on permits as 10% even if they are 
actually 15% or 20% of the roof. Homeowners are supposed to get a building 
permit if their roof repair costs more than $200, although many do not, Harder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge, of the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau, said the Los Angeles ordinance 
will be a financial burden for many homeowners. Where it might have cost $500 
to repair an existing wood roof, it could cost $5,000 or more to replace it, he 
said. Parsons said homeowners can appeal to the Building and Safety Department 
for an exception if they are unable to afford the replacement. 
</P>
<P>
For additional protection, the new Los Angeles law also requires homeowners to 
tear off their old wood roofs before installing a new covering. Previously, new 
roofs could be placed over existing wood shakes or shingles if the roof types 
were compatible. The change will mean probably $300 to $500 more in labor 
costs, Harder said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Prefer Wood 
</P>
<P>
There's also the issue of how far government can go in telling people what to 
put on their house, Rutledge said. Fire Marshal Gray's response to that 
argument is that cities have to take reasonable steps to prevent people from 
jeopardizing others' lives and property. 
</P>
<P>
But many people still prefer the rugged, natural texture of wood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the prettiest roof you can put on," said Merle Greene. "Nothing looks 
like wood." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Greene bought a 33-year-old ranch house in the Woodland Hills 
area of Los Angeles. She didn't expect to replace the existing, untreated wood 
roof for several years. But with the ban suddenly on the horizon, Greene 
decided it was now or never. She got a permit before the deadline and spent 
$15,000 for a new fire-resistant wood roof. 
</P>
<P>
She's confident that the treated shakes are safe, although she added she might 
be more cautious if she lived in a brushy, hillside area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncleared Brush 
</P>
<P>
Uncleared brush is also a major factor in fires, as wood roof advocates point 
out. Firefighters agree, but they emphasize that with a fire-resistant roof 
flames are less likely to spread. 
</P>
<P>
Any house can burn, however, in a firestorm, where intense heat and winds cause 
windows to implode, allowing the contents of a home to catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
In the Puente Hills fire, of the 37 buildings destroyed or damaged, 13 had 
untreated wood roofs, nine had composition roofs, nine had metal roofs and four 
had tile or slate. 
</P>
<P>
While no roof is absolutely fireproof, some coverings offer more protection 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
Tile is extremely fire resistant and long-lasting, roofing experts say. It can 
be fairly expensive depending on the type of tile, although its durability 
balances out the cost in the long run, said Richard Boon, deputy director of 
the Roofing Industry Educational Institute in Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement Needed 
</P>
<P>
Concrete tile is less expensive than traditional clay tile, but some people 
prefer clay's texture and coloring. The main drawback to tile is its weight. 
Houses not designed for a tile roof need reinforcement to support the extra 
load, which adds several hundred dollars to the cost of reroofing. 
</P>
<P>
However, the tile industry is developing a lighter-weight concrete tile to 
overcome the problem, said Walter Pruder, executive vice president of the 
National Tile Roof Manufacturers Assn., a Los Angeles-based trade group. 
Although tile is used on most new California houses, manufacturers want a 
bigger share of the reroofing market, Pruder said. 
</P>
<P>
For people who don't want to worry about reinforcing their roofs, manufacturers 
of tile and wood substitutes cite the relatively light weight of their products 
as a selling point. They're also taking advantage of the wood-roof ban to 
promote their products as alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many are made to look like wood, if you don't get too close. One 
product, Masonite Corp.'s Woodruf, includes wood fibers and inorganic material. 
A fire-resistant variety is available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Fire Resistance 
</P>
<P>
Others are made of various mixtures that include perlite, cement and wood 
fibers. Although fairly expensive, they offer high fire resistance and a long 
life. Among the brand names are Cal-Shake, Hardishake, Permatek and MaxiTile. 
</P>
<P>
However, some industry experts are cautious about these and other relatively 
new products on the market that carry warranties ranging from 20 to 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans don't stay in a house long enough to see if the roof lives up to 
its guarantee, said Thomas Lee Smith, of the technology and research office for 
the National Roofing Contractors Assn. in Rosemont, Ill. Some warranties can be 
transferred to a new owner. But the warranties are often prorated. If a 20-year 
product fails after 15 years, (75% of its warranted life), the refund would be 
25% of the original product cost, according to the NRCA. 
</P>
<P>
Price is one of the major factors in choosing a roof. The NRCA suggests 
dividing the cost by the life span of the roof to get an annual cost, making it 
easier to compare different roofing types. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Composition Most Popular 
</P>
<P>
Some more expensive materials may have a longer life and cost less to install. 
Cost also depends on the condition of the present roof and whether it has to be 
removed or repaired before new roofing can be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Asphalt composition shingles are generally the least expensive. Nationwide, 
composition shingles are the most popular type of roofing material, Smith said. 
Many of these shingles are also designed to resemble wood. Fiberglass-based 
asphalt shingles have a higher fire resistance rating, usually Class A, while 
those with a paper byproduct base are Class C, said Russell K. Snyder, 
spokesman for the Asphalt Roofing and Manufacturers Assn. in Rockville, Md. 
Laminated fiberglass shingles are available with a thicker, textured look that 
has more visual appeal than a flat shingle, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
With treated wood and many other roof types, the material used underneath can 
increase fire resistance. Local regulations may require certain methods of 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
Spending thousands of dollars for a new roof can have some additional benefits 
besides fire protection. It may qualify homeowners for lower insurance rates, 
although that varies by company and home location, said Debbie Rosenzweig, 
staff writer for the Western Insurance Information Service in Tustin. A new 
roof adds significantly to a home's value, said James A. Link, president of the 
San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever homeowners decide to do, they should avoid the experience of one young 
fellow in Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
Batt. Chief Cary said the man was smoking while replacing his mother's 
untreated wood roof with composition shingle. After doing half the roof, he 
came down for lunch. His lunch break ended when a neighbor told him the roof 
was on fire. Cary said a cigarette apparently ignited the old wood roof, 
causing about $90,000 damage to the house and contents before firefighters 
extinguished the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO CHOOSE A ROOFING CONTRACTOR 
</P>
<P>
Ask for customer references. Look at examples of the contractor's workmanship 
and ask previous customers if they were satisfied with all aspects of the job. 
</P>
<P>
Check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if anyone has filed a 
complaint against the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the contractor has a state license number; check with the Contractors 
State License Board in your area to see if the number is valid and the 
contractor is in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
Find out how long the contractor has been doing roofing. (Generally, the lower 
the state license number, the longer the contractor has been in business.) Be 
sure the contractor has a permanent business address and phone number, so you 
can contact him later if problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
Get several written estimates and compare them. Give each contractor identical, 
itemized specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Verify that the contractor has workers' compensation and liability insurance. 
If the contractor is not insured and a worker is injured on your property, you 
will be liable. You may also want additional insurance, in the form of a bond 
that guarantees completion of the project and payment for labor and materials. 
</P>
<P>
Get a written warranty on both materials and workmanship, and get starting and 
completion dates in writing also. 
</P>

DEVELOPER FEES BUY IMPROVEMENTS, BUT HOME BUYERS PAY 
</P>

Report, a Ventura-based monthly newsletter covering local growth issues around

<P>
The Long Beach City Council did something surprising last spring. Surprising, 
at least, to home builders. 
</P>
<P>
Council members took a second look at a $3,500-a-house park fee they were about 
to approve and they cut it by more than $800. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the fee, the council decided to work with the school district to 
convert under-used school playgrounds into part-time city parks. By gaining 
more parkland that way, the city wouldn't need so much money to buy land for 
new parks. 
</P>
<P>
And by cutting the fee, the council mollified local home builders, who claimed 
the high fee would drive the cost of new houses up -- and perhaps drive some 
builders out of town. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach park tariff is one of myriad so-called development fees -- 
standardized, per-house charges placed on new construction by local 
governments. Also called "impact" fees, such charges now range from $3,000 to 
well over $20,000 a house in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The money raised by the fees is supposed to be used for schools, roads and 
other public facilities that must be built or expanded to accommodate the new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Home builders claim such fees drive up house prices because they must pass them 
on to the home buyers. Local officials say that because of Proposition 13's 
restrictions on property taxes, they have no other way to pay for new schools, 
libraries, roads and sewer lines. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's scaling back of the park fee did not begin a headlong rush by 
cities and counties to lower their development fees on new houses. By all 
accounts, the fees are still going up, many are being used for a broader range 
of purposes than ever before and they still top the list of home builders' 
favorite gripes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Long Beach action is one of several indications that 
development fees -- many of which have been slapped on willy-nilly by local 
governments -- will be subject to greater scrutiny and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Riverside County, large home builders took a big hit last year 
when county supervisors imposed a $4,300-a-house fee on development agreements 
-- but the charge is non-negotiable, which developers hope will save them time 
(and money) in haggling with local officials. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a new state law requires more accountability on how 
development fees are spent. This has led many local governments to separate fee 
revenue into trust funds to be used for specific projects -- projects 
benefiting the developments paying the fees -- rather than dumping the money 
into their general capital-projects fund. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, local governments must follow state laws in establishing fees. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the so-called Quimby Act lays out rules that cities and counties 
must follow in establishing fees used to acquire parkland, as Long Beach did. 
School districts may impose development fees on new houses and residential 
expansions, but these fees are limited by law to $1.50 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fees Headed Higher 
</P>
<P>
And a new law that went into effect this year -- known as AB 1600, for the 
legislative bill number -- requires all local governments to keep much closer 
track of their fee revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Fees throughout Southern California are high and, apparently, still on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
A survey in June by the San Diego Construction Industry Federation found that 
for an average house, development fees in San Diego County ranged from $3,000 
(National City) to almost $24,000 (Escondido). 
</P>
<P>
A similar survey in Riverside County, conducted last year by the Building 
Industry Assn., found that fees for the average home ranged from less than 
$6,000 in Blythe to almost $13,000 in unincorporated county territory. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some new fees are coming into use -- such as the $1,950-an-acre 
fee on developers in much of Riverside County that will be used to create a 
habitat for the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City and County Fees 
</P>
<P>
And these fees do not include the cost of land and other public facilities that 
cities and counties sometimes also require from developers. For example, the 
CIF survey found, these dedications increase the fees in Carlsbad from $13,000 
to about $23,000 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, state laws governing development fees sometimes drive them up. In 
1986, the state Legislature passed the cap on school fees partly so they 
wouldn't get too high. (The fee cap was part of a larger school construction 
finance package.) But once the Legislature specifically authorized school 
districts to levy such fees, virtually every school district in the state -- 
whether growing or not -- imposed them. 
</P>
<P>
And park fees are often driven up by the provisions of the Quimby Act, which 
require that fees be tied to the cost of the parkland to be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
In June, for example, the city of Oceanside raised its park fee from $740 to 
$3,200 a unit -- over the objections of the building industry -- because land 
prices had risen so much since the last increase in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Six or seven years of inflation and rising property values went unaccounted 
for," said Douglas Williford, a senior planner with the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Estimates 
</P>
<P>
From a city's point of view, fees are desirable because they carry little 
political risk; the cost is borne entirely by developers and future home 
buyers, not by current voters. And in urban planning and public finance 
circles, sophisticated methods of calculating fees are widely admired as 
examples of municipal self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
Cities such as Carlsbad and Escondido have built financial estimates into their 
growth projects over the next 20 years, calculating to the penny how much each 
new house will cost their city in the form of road usage, water and sewer 
requirements, library use, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the American Planning Assn. in San Diego some time ago, Tim 
Huntley, then Escondido's director of finance and management, explained the 
municipal attitude this way: 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't expect sympathetic or even consistent legislation from the state 
or federal government, then we need to develop a strategy to ensure that local 
government can pay for the services necessary to support new development. We 
have a professional obligation to ensure the continued solvency of local 
government itself, and we have to do that in a hostile environment." 
</P>
<P>
This "hostile" environment for cities is created in large part by home 
builders, who consistently oppose higher fees on the ground that they increase 
home prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Favorite Gripe 
</P>
<P>
Development fees are a favorite gripe for many home builders, who say local 
politicians do not consider the concerns of the builders and home buyers who 
must pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody else is paying the bill, any idea seems like a great one, and 
that's the problem," said Gordon Tippell, president of Taylor-Woodrow Homes in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether the fee is passed through to home buyers is a matter of 
considerable dispute. Some builders say there is no dollar-for-dollar 
relationship between fees and prices, and that sometimes builders eat part of 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of a house is what people are prepared to pay for it, not what it 
cost for us to build it," Tippell said. Other experts say a home builder may 
charge the same for the house -- because that's what their target market can 
pay -- but reduce the size or quality of the house to pay for the fees. 
</P>
<P>
"He may kick out some of the amenities he was going to offer," says Rod Hanway, 
executive director of the Riverside County BIA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Buyers Get Stuck 
</P>
<P>
In general, however, experts agree that in a hot real estate market, when 
demand is high and prices are going up anyway, home buyers do get stuck with 
most of the bill for higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question that it's having a substantial effect on 
the housing prices in Southern California," says Michael Stegman, an urban 
planning professor at the University of North Carolina and co-author of "Paying 
for Growth," a book about development fees. 
</P>
<P>
For many builders, the biggest issue about fees is accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"The concerns that developers have with fees aren't so much with the fees 
themselves but with fees that may be excessive or misused," says Randall Lewis, 
vice president of Lewis Homes in Upland, one of Southern California's largest 
home builders. 
</P>
<P>
And it is in the area of accountability that the world of fees is changing most 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Serve Subdivision 
</P>
<P>
In theory, development fees should pay only for new facilities required by the 
construction of a housing development -- either new roads, sewers and schools 
within a new subdivision or the expansion of freeways, libraries and other 
citywide facilities to accommodate the new residents. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike Oceanside or Escondido, many communities have not used statistical 
analysis to determine their fee structures. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, cities don't have a rationale for their fee," said Bill 
Hendrickson, a consultant with Economic &amp; Planning Systems in Berkeley, 
which does economic analysis for cities. "It's been done arbitrarily, in the 
spirit of, 'Hey, these things are connected somehow.' Many won't make a real 
concerted effort to distinguish between those improvements that benefit 
existing and those that benefit new development." 
</P>
<P>
However, two recent events -- a court ruling and the passage of a new state law 
-- have forced cities to become more accountable for their fees. Two years ago, 
in Nollan vs. California Coastal Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
development fees must be directly linked to the impact of the development 
paying the fees. 
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up to Nollan, the Legislature passed a law that has imposed even 
more accountability on local governments. AB 1600, as the law is known, 
requires that any local government imposing a development fee -- whether city, 
county or school district -- must draw up a capital improvement plan describing 
what facilities will be built with the revenue, deposit the funds in a separate 
trust fund and spend the money within five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hiring More Consultants 
</P>
<P>
These requirements are not likely to result in lower fees. For example, when an 
Orange County judge ruled that the Newport-Mesa School District had improperly 
imposed $1.50-per-square-foot fees on an area where enrollment was not growing, 
the fees were refunded to certain developers. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction among other school districts, however, was to not eliminate 
questionable fees but to hire more economic consultants to justify them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the initial rush-rush, some districts may not have appropriately drawn the 
relationships between the need for the fee and the impact of the development," 
said John Mockler, a Sacramento lobbyist for the Coalition for Adequate School 
Housing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Nollan case and AB 1600 do appear to be bringing more 
certainty and accountability to the development fee situation around the state. 
</P>
<P>
That accountability may mean home buyers will be assured that the fees will be 
used to benefit their housing tracts -- and it may even lead to lower permit 
processing costs by reducing negotiation between home builders and local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Contracts 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County, for example, has standardized its fee schedule for large 
developers who work with the county on "development agreements" or long-term 
contracts that are usually subject to considerable negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than try to negotiate with each individual developer," said Joe 
Richards, the county's deputy planning director, "we developed a fee package 
that each DA (development agreement) was subject to, and the fees addressed 
public facilities, regional parks, open space and a long-term maintenance 
component of public facilities." 
</P>
<P>
As required by AB 1600, the fees go into four trust funds, which will be used 
according to spending plans drawn up by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The $4,300-a-unit fee under development agreements is higher than the standard 
county development fee of about $2,700, but it's possible that the time saved 
by using a standard fee rather than a negotiation could cut home builders' 
costs -- and the eventual purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased accountability, residential development fees will 
probably continue to rise as long as Southern California's housing market 
remains strong. But the rise could be stopped if Proposition 13 is reformed 
and/or if local governments start placing more of the infrastructure burden on 
commercial and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gathering Signatures 
</P>
<P>
For example, the "Fair Share Property Tax Act of 1990," an initiative proposed 
by the consumer organization Voter Revolt, would prohibit further increases in 
development fees. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which is in the signature-gathering stage, would provide more 
money to local governments by creating a split property tax roll -- holding the 
limit at 1% for residential property but increasing it to 2.2% for commercial 
and industrial property. The resulting $9-billion-a-year windfall could be used 
for infrastructure, among other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities in California, both large and small, have imposed heavy development 
fees on commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown San Francisco office buildings, for example, pay about $13 a square 
foot in fees for child care, transit and even affordable housing. Los Angeles 
has a transportation fee in certain areas and appears poised to adopt a housing 
fee. Many school districts have levied not only the $1.50-per-square-foot 
residential fee permitted by state law, but also the 25-cent-per-square-foot 
fee on commercial and industrial construction allowed by the same law. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller cities with sophisticated growth-financing systems, such as Carlsbad, 
levy infrastructure fees on all types of construction. But in many cases, 
cities and counties that impose heavy fees on housing are going out of their 
way to encourage commercial and industrial development.

SIX WAYS TO PROTECT AGAINST LITIGIOUS BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCLOSE DEFECTS, PROVIDE AN INSPECTION, GET AN INSURANCE POLICY TO COVER 
REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and real 
estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Selling your home or other real estate is not easy. With prices so high, buyers 
have become very picky and demanding. They expect the property to be in perfect 
condition. But no home is without flaws, so sellers and their realty agents 
must know how to protect against buyers who are only too anxious to sue for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
For example, last year I sold a newly remodeled home. As far as I knew, 
everything was in tiptop condition. However, just last month I received a bill 
from the buyer who expects me to pay the cost of cleaning the sewer line, seven 
months after the sale was closed. To guard against being liable for frivolous 
claims like this, smart home sellers and their realty agents take these 
precautions: 
</P>
<P>
Disclose, disclose, disclose. The best protection a home seller and his/her 
realty agent have against a litigious home buyer is to disclose in writing all 
known defects in the property. For example, recently I inspected a home for 
sale where the realty agent left written disclosure forms on the kitchen 
counter so all prospective buyers could take a copy to study. 
</P>
<P>
California was the first state to require sellers and their realty agents to 
provide written home defect disclosures to buyers. In states without similar 
disclosure requirements, the best real estate agents ask their sellers to fill 
out voluntary disclosure forms to protect both home sellers and their agents. 
</P>
<P>
Provide a one-year home warranty policy for the buyer. Most realty agents 
recommend their sellers provide a one-year home warranty policy, costing around 
$250, which pays for repairs to the plumbing, wiring, heating and built-in 
appliances. Such warranties prevent buyer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, about a week after I moved into my current residence, the water 
heater began to leak. I'm sure the seller had no knowledge of this problem, but 
it was nice to phone the warranty company and have a new water heater installed 
the same day at a cost of only a $25 service fee. As a result, the seller and 
realtor never heard any complaint from me. 
</P>
<P>
Have the home professionally inspected at the time of listing. The best realty 
agents recommend their home sellers obtain a professional inspection at the 
time the house is listed for sale. The cost is around $300 in most communities, 
sometimes less. Such a report is reassuring to prospective buyers who may have 
doubts about a home's structural soundness. It also reveals any defects found 
by the inspector, so the buyer cannot later complain about nondisclosure. 
</P>
<P>
Obtain a termite inspection report when listing the home for sale. Another 
technique the best professional realty agents use is to order a termite and 
structural pest control inspection report at the time the home is listed for 
sale. This prevents costly surprises for the seller later. 
</P>
<P>
Most home buyers and mortgage lenders insist on such reports, so it is best to 
know the extent of any damage up front. The seller can elect to either have the 
damage repaired or to give the buyer credit for the repair cost. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the buyer can hire his/her own inspection company but if a report 
has already been obtained, the buyer will usually accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure the realty agent carries errors and omissions insurance. Despite all 
precautions, just in case something goes wrong and an unexpected defect later 
materializes, be sure the realty agent carries errors and omissions insurance 
from a reputable insurer. Beware of self-insured agents who may not have 
adequate reserves. A realty agent without "E and O insurance" is like an 
uninsured motorist -- very dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Sell the home "as is." Finally, after using all these techniques, if you are 
the seller and are not certain of the home's physical condition or if you want 
to avoid any possible liability for a defective condition, such as an 
inadequate septic tank, sell the home "as is." That means the seller and realty 
agent have disclosed known defects and make no warranties or representations 
and will not pay for any repairs. For further details, please consult a real 
estate attorney.

THE REAL MEANING OF 'HOUSE OF TOMORROW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DORIS A. FULLER, Fuller is a former Times staff writer who runs a corporate 
communications firm from a home office without baseboards and closet doors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Living through remodeling has given new meaning to the old phrase "Live in the 
house of tomorrow -- today." 
</P>
<P>
I live in the house of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow (or sometime thereafter), my living room lamps will plug directly into 
sockets instead of into heavy-duty extension cords that snake under area rugs 
to distant walls. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, there will be doors on my home's five clothes closets, two 
water-heater closets and one laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
And tomorrow, my stove will be vented, every room will have baseboards and the 
powder room will be a place where guests will powder instead of where I'm 
hiding the kids' Christmas gifts -- which says a lot about how early I do my 
Christmas shopping and how far away I think tomorrow may be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Race to Finish 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling is usually a race to see which will be finished first: your house, 
your sanity or your money. 
</P>
<P>
The house always runs dead last. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I decided to concede our sanity almost from the start in hopes 
of finishing our house before we finish our money. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to do the work ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
This probably sounds a little rash. Actually, it's a lot rash. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best of circumstances remodeling requires infinite patience, a 
high tolerance level for disorder and dust and, ideally, a healthy appreciation 
of the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knowing the Trades 
</P>
<P>
When you happen to be married to your contractor, your electrician, your 
plumber, your framer, your painter and your finish carpenter, deciding you 
can't stand the people doing your remodel can have serious consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are the sheer mechanics of the undertaking -- knowing a dozen 
trades well enough to live with how you execute them, assembling the tools you 
need for the job, finding the time to get it all done in less than a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Before we conceded our sanity, my husband, Don, and I understood all these 
realities perfectly. We were just another typical California couple sitting on 
a bundle of equity that wouldn't fit into our microscopic master closet, 
figuring that a good architect and contractor could do for us what the fairy 
godmother had done for Cinderella and in only slightly more time. 
</P>
<P>
We had rejected moving. The same price spiral that had generated our equity 
bundle guaranteed that, if we sold our house, we could take the money and buy 
another one just like it. No reason to break a few more pieces of china in a 
move for that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Professionals 
</P>
<P>
So all we had to do was hire the right people and leave it to them to enlarge 
our 1950s ranch-style La Jolla home by 2,000 square feet (adding family, 
breakfast, powder and laundry rooms), to relocate our kitchen, to replace a 
mind-boggling trapezoidal fourth bedroom and to give us a master bedroom worthy 
of the name. 
</P>
<P>
Only when we learned the going rate for fairy godmothers in hard hats did we 
embark on a different course. 
</P>
<P>
The architect wanted $40,000 of our $200,000 budget, and the contractor 
expected about the same. Altogether, these services were going to consume 40% 
of the funds we had hoped would last not only through construction but through 
landscaping and redecorating as well. Either we upped the ante or settled for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Neither alternative was appealing, so my husband -- a Jack-of-all-trades and 
master of just about everything he puts his head or mind to -- bought a 
drafting table and resurrected drafting skills learned in his youth. From his 
detailed work, a draftsman completed the drawings and obtained our first 
permits for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Then we put the demolition and framing out to bid, committed to simply subbing 
the job out ourselves. The bid: $25,000, plus materials. My husband ambled down 
to Home Depot, just out of curiosity (so he said), to price lumber for the 
framing. It was $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordered Load of Lumber 
</P>
<P>
A computer scientist by training, a high-tech chief executive by profession, 
Don was at a juncture in his career when it was possible to drop out of the 
executive suite for a spell. Moreover, (unbeknown to me) he had always dreamed 
of building his own home. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered our first load of lumber, and the house of tomorrow was under way. 
</P>
<P>
From the framing, he went on to do the plumbing ($1,500 in materials versus the 
$10,000 bid) and the wiring (by which time we weren't even bothering to get 
bids). 
</P>
<P>
He moved the kitchen and put in all new appliances, installed 17 French doors, 
three dozen windows and three garage doors, replaced all the plumbing and 
wiring, all the closets, all the woodwork. No room was untouched. 
</P>
<P>
We did hire a handful of subcontractors for jobs Don disliked or couldn't 
manage single-handedly -- the roof, the ceramic tile, the drywall, finishing 
the concrete, some cabinetry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings Enormous 
</P>
<P>
Our experience with our subs in every case was either without flaw (when we had 
bothered to check references) or a disaster (when we didn't). We learned the 
hard way that instinct alone is not the best indicator of who will get the job 
done well and on time. 
</P>
<P>
But even subbing out some of the work, our savings were enormous -- so we 
expanded our original plans to include upgrades of every room in the existing 
house plus a second story with an office and a fifth bedroom and bath. In the 
end, we built 3,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Our new old home is now (or will be tomorrow) what one friend calls a Beaver 
Cleaver house: a traditional home with hardwood floors, raised-panel 
wainscoting, serious baseboards, crown moldings, true divided-light windows, 
solid-brass fixtures, top-notch appliances -- finishing touches not provided 
for in the original contractor estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Our overall cost: about $40 a square foot -- roughly one-third the cost of 
turning the job over to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Construction 
</P>
<P>
Of course, nearly two years after we started, the dining and powder rooms are 
still under construction, the office and fifth bedroom await woodwork, and a 
bald light bulb dangles outside our battered pre-remodel front door. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes we have homicidal impulses when people ask when the house will be 
finished. (Sometimes my husband has homicidal impulses when I ask when the 
house will be finished.) And our home features a few (very few, my husband is 
grousing in the background) little, er, eccentricities it might not have 
acquired in the hands of someone who does this for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Besides learning to investigate our subs, we took some tough on-the-job lessons 
about the necessity of scheduling ("What? We can't have the windows for five 
weeks? But the plasterer is due the week after next") and budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
You think that you've covered everything when you've anticipated the cost of 
lumber, wiring, piping, windows, doors and concrete. But a remodel is full of 
items you don't think of at first: doorknobs, mirrors, lighting, new electrical 
service, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most sane thing we did was to hire a multi-talented interior 
designer, Earline Tanner, who was capable of acting not only as our decorator 
but as an in-lieu architect and on-site mediator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decorator-Adviser 
</P>
<P>
We never argued once over a construction item (priorities, yes; construction 
items, no). We just called Earline. We'd both present our views. By mutual 
agreement, whatever she said, went. This move alone saved thousands on marriage 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
By purchasing in volume, we were able to negotiate professional discounts with 
most of the wholesale trade suppliers and even some home-improvement retailers, 
another cost saver. 
</P>
<P>
But, best of all, we got everything we wanted and may yet finish with the house 
before we finish with the money, and there's nothing crazy about that at all.

ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGES DECLINE IN POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been a steep decline in adjustable-rate mortgages in Southern 
California, according to Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla, which 
provides real estate data to lending institutions, title companies and industry 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Adjustable-rate mortgages were used to finance 25.7% of Southern California 
real estate purchases in August. In August, 1988, 61.9% of all real estate 
buyers in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino counties 
chose adjustable-rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
"The steep decline reflects lower fixed-rate mortgage rates as well as a 
narrower gap between fixed-rate and ARM interest rates," said Donald L. Cohn, 
president of Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates peaked in March at an average 11.22%. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, choosing an ARM often meant being able to buy a home you wouldn't 
have qualified for with a fixed-rate mortgage," Cohn said. "That's not 
necessarily the case any more. Lenders have also curbed the heavy discount on 
initial ARM rates. These 'teaser' rates reduced profitability." 
</P>

PINE STORAGE BIN KEEPS FRUIT, VEGETABLES FRESH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLINGTON, Ellingson has been designing patterns and plans for the 
amateur woodworker since 1948. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Potatoes, onions and just about any other fruit or vegetables you keep on hand 
will stay fresh longer in this set of storage bins made of pine. 
</P>
<P>
The top shelf is flat, allowing you to store canned goods or dish towels, while 
the bottom two drawers are actual bins. The wire-mesh fronts of each bin allow 
the air to circulate around the foodstuff which, in turn, keeps moisture from 
rotting the fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring about 39 inches tall by 18 inches wide and 11 3/4 inches deep, this 
practical piece of furniture is easy enough for the amateur woodworker to 
complete. Our step-by-step directions, with accompanying photos, guide you in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut All the Boards 
</P>
<P>
First, cut all the boards according to the schedule, and trace and cut the 
patterns for curves onto the appropriate boards. Assembly is a series of gluing 
and nailing the pieces together. The finishing hardware will be available to 
you locally, but we offer a source for ordering a complete package for your 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain Storage Bins, Pattern No. 797, please send $4.50. Another kitchen 
convenience you might be looking for is our free-standing Chopping Block, 
Pattern No. 642, also $4.50, providing four square feet of work space and as 
easy to build as a box. 
</P>
<P>
Prices include postage and prompt handling. California residents add 6% sales 
tax. Send check or money order to Steve Ellington, c/o the Los Angeles Times, 
P.O. Box 2383, Van Nuys, Calif. 91409-2383.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: CENTRAL VACUUM CAN REDUCE CLEANING NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I was considering installing a central vacuum cleaning system to 
reduce vacuum cleaning noise and dust in my home. Does a central vacuum system 
use more electricity? Is a higher horsepower motor always better? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Vacuum cleaners use a significant amount of electricity. Some uprights 
and canisters use up to 4 peak horsepower. This is as high an electricity usage 
rate as some central air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
A vacuum cleaner with the highest horsepower motor may not clean the best. A 
rating called "Air Power," which factors in both suction and volume of air 
flow, is a better measure of cleaning ability. Be sure to check whether the air 
power rating is at the tank or at the end of the hose. 
</P>
<P>
A central vacuum cleaner design using two smaller motors may clean as well or 
better than a canister or upright with a single larger motor. Higher total 
horsepower uses more electricity. The price of a central system is about as 
much as some top-of-the-line standard vacuum cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
If you are handy with tools, you can install one yourself. These units use a 
32-foot flexible hose, so you generally need only one or two vacuum wall 
outlets on each floor. In existing houses, you can easily run the 2-inch 
plastic vacuum pipe up through closets, cold air return ducts, etc. 
</P>
<P>
There are several advantages of a central system. The collection unit and motor 
are located in a basement, garage or utility room. This reduces the noise level 
in your home. You don't have to lug a heavy vacuum cleaner around your house. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many manufacturers recommend venting the outlet from the main unit to the 
outdoors. This eliminates the small amounts of dust that get through the 
multiple-stage filters. With a standard vacuum cleaner, this dust ends up back 
on your carpet and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
There are two basic types of dirt storage designs for central vacuum cleaner 
systems: bag or cyclonic. With a bag design, a 6-gallon disposable vacuum 
cleaner bag is used. When it's full, you replace it. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclonic design forces the dirt to swirl around to compact it in the 
central unit storage canister. When it is full, you just empty it into a 
plastic garbage bag or trash can. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bag design requires bag changes, its cleaning performance can be 
better. The cleaning air power with a bag system stays very constant until the 
bag is nearly full. Then it drops off quickly, so you know it's time to change 
it. The air power of a cyclonic system continuously drops gradually, so you may 
let it overfill and get inadequate cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 378 showing manufacturers of 
bag and cyclonic central vacuum systems, information on a high-efficiency 
two-motor bag model, and installation instructions for an existing house. 
Please include $1 and a self-addressed business envelope. Send your requests to 
James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

Reflective Foil Can Save Heat in Winter 
</P>
<P>
Q: I installed reflective foil in my attic to lower my air-conditioning costs 
and I have some extra foil left. Would it help in the winter if I put the foil 
under the floor joist above the crawl space? 
</P>
<P>
A: Reflective foil can also be effective for saving heat in the winter. As long 
as there is an air gap above the foil, it will reduce the radiant heat loss 
through the floor and make your room feel warmer. Staple the foil up under the 
floor joists with the shiny side facing up. Poke holes in the foil to allow 
water vapor to escape.

SOME NEW HOME BUYERS GET SURPRISED BY TAX BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM FULTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes home buyers find out that development fees can come in a different 
and often surprising package: a higher tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Not all infrastructure required by new subdivisions is paid for by development 
fees. Sometimes roads, water and sewer lines, and schools in new housing tracts 
are paid for with a special type of bond issue, which is then paid off with 
additional property taxes paid only by the homeowners in that tract. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes these financing deals are arranged with a traditional assessment 
district, in which each homeowner is assessed proportionally, according to the 
benefit he or she receives from the facility being built. 
</P>
<P>
More and more often, however, the bonds are issued through a so-called 
"Mello-Roos district," under which a developer can commit the homeowners in 
advance to a higher property tax rate than Proposition 13 would otherwise 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical Mello-Roos district, named after the two state legislators Henry 
J. Mello (D-Watsonville) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) who 
sponsored the legislation, a county or school district works with a developer 
to float a bond issue before the tract is built. 
</P>
<P>
After the homes are sold, all homeowners are required to pay the same amount of 
tax (no matter how valuable the house is or how much benefit they receive from 
the facilities) each year. Since 1983, $1.2 billion in Mello-Roos bonds have 
been floated in California, most often in Orange and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The additional tax is tacked onto the 1% general property tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean home buyers are willing to absorb these costs completely. 
"Home buyers are getting more sophisticated," says Cary Lowe of Coussoulis 
Development Co., a home builder in Redlands. "There's really market resistance 
to a total property tax rate that exceeds 2%. Buyers are more and more 
expecting to see a discount for that on the sales price." 
</P>
<P>
And home buyers are better informed as well. 
</P>
<P>
After a few home buyers in early Mello-Roos districts were jarred by 
surprisingly high tax bills, the state Legislature passed a new law last year 
requiring Mello-Roos obligations to be recorded with the county recorder so 
that it will appear as part of a home buyer's title search. WILLIAM FULTON

INTERIORS: NEW HOMEOWNER NEEDS FLEXIBILITY; 
</P>
<P>
START WITH SOUND BASICS THAT CAN BE USED AS BUILDING BLOCKS FOR FUTURE 
DECORATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first-time homeowner doesn't have to settle for make-do furniture because 
of a budget, says a furnishings and design editor. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, start with flexible basics that will look terrific right now, and 
also will make great building blocks for future decorating schemes," says 
Denise L. Caringer, of Better Homes and Gardens magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Don't settle for lower quality and don't feel locked into a look or color 
scheme that will be difficult or costly to change later on. Instead, she has 
these suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Skip the busy wall coverings and fancy window wear. Instead, slick up and 
unify the background with white paint, white window blinds, shades or curtains 
and, if possible, neutral floor coverings. 
</P>
<P>
This will produce an airy, expansive look, and will also make a neutral 
"canvas" on which style can be easily created. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid matching "suites" of furniture. Instead, choose a mix of 
well-designed basics that can be shifted to other rooms or other homes. A 
bedroom dresser, for example, has limited use, but an armoire fits in virtually 
anywhere, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Consider modular storage pieces, bookcases and stacking cubes, with optional 
doors, drawers and shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Furnish a sitting spot with four wicker lounge chairs instead of buying an 
expensive sofa for the living room. Float the chairs in a cloverleaf-shaped 
grouping in the middle of the room and anchor them with an area rug. Wicker is 
versatile, she says, so you won't lock yourself into a changeless look. Fabric 
cushions can set the mood. 
</P>
<P>
Later on, you can move them to a porch or split them up, using a pair with a 
new sofa and moving the others to bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the living room does not have a natural focal point, such as a great 
window or a fireplace, put two or three low-cost white bookcases together, or 
place an antique bench or a couple of low chests side by side and hang an 
oversized poster above them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stacked books next to a chair make a great resting place for a cup or 
glass. Turn a cube, basket or a concrete block into a coffee table by topping 
it with a piece of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Simple, well-designed lamps, such as flex-arm architects lamps, 
ceramic-base table lamps or sleek metal floor lamps, can be supplemented with 
clamp-on spotlights to highlight artwork and canister-style up-lights to wake 
up dull corners. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For dining, a white outdoor table and casual chairs -- wicker, molded 
plastic, metal or wood-and-canvas -- serve as "summer-house" companions to the 
airy living room scheme. For a more formal or traditional look, buy quality 
dining chairs and team them with a round, skirted-to-the-floor dining table. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let your personality color the surroundings. Family photos? Seashells? 
Books? Baskets? Group small treasures for a bigger impact.

ANAHEIM RETAIL PROJECT WILL INCLUDE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ground breaking is set for spring 1990 on Lincoln Village, a $40-million, 
21-acre mixed housing and retail project that will provide 388 housing units in 
downtown Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The variety of uses in the project are designed to encourage downtown workers 
to live near the downtown businesses district. 
</P>
<P>
Architect for the retail and apartment properties is Klages, Carter, Vail &amp; 
Partners. Architect Michael McHale is designing the single-family, duplex and 
townhouse properties. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Property, the contractor, will also serve as property manager. 
</P>
<P>
The project was developed by Lincoln with the Anaheim Redevelopment Agency. The 
agreement between the city and the developer requires the developer to give 
priority to the purchase or lease of housing units to individuals employed in 
downtown Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easing Traffic Congestion 
</P>
<P>
The requirement is intended to ease traffic congestion in the downtown area by 
encouraging pedestrian traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Housing types incorporated in the project include single-family detached homes, 
duplexes, townhouses and rental units, and a combination of retail and rental 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Stipkovich, Anaheim's director of community development, said Lincoln 
Village is intended to add to the mix of retail, residential and civic uses 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the project will be linked to other downtown sites by a planned 
vehicular- and pedestrian-oriented esplanade that will extend from Harbor Place 
east past the Civic Center and along Center Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The architectural style shows a sensitivity to the surrounding neighborhoods," 
Stipkovich said. "We hope this new development will encourage continuing 
restoration of homes in the original Craftsman style." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Completion Estimates 
</P>
<P>
The project will be developed in one phase, and construction of the for-sale 
properties properties is expected to be completed six months after ground 
breaking. Rental properties will be completed in 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Davis, partner with Lincoln Property Co., said rents will range from an 
estimated $725 for one-bedroom, one-bath units to $875 for two-bedroom, 
two-bath units. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family homes will range from 1,500 to 1,900 square feet and sell for 
$183,500 to $221,500. Sales prices for duplexes and townhouses, ranging in size 
from 1,250 to 1,600 square feet, are estimated at $156,500 to $178,700. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial retail rents are projected at $1 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The area being developed as single-family homes and duplexes is on the north 
side of Lincoln Avenue to Cypress Street on the north, and includes townhouse 
units south of Center Street, between Olive and Atchison streets. 
</P>
<P>
Mixed apartment and commercial development will be located in the area bounded 
by Lincoln Avenue, Olive, Center and Philadelphia streets.

circumstances, she always manages to keep things in order." 
</P>
<P>
But even the minister acknowledges that with his parishioner unable to find a 
landlord in Santa Monica who is able, or willing, to rent to a single mother 
with five children, Cartee faces an uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
No longer able to afford the rent for her two-bedroom apartment in Palms, and 
with her landlord wanting her to move next week, Cartee's four-month search for 
an apartment in Santa Monica -- where she works and the children attend school 
-- has become a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
And it has also become a cause celebre for a key member of the Rent Control 
Board who is threatening to pull the plug on a proposed major change in Santa 
Monica's rent control law unless some landlord comes to Cartee's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tests the Hearts of Landlords 
</P>
<P>
"I view this as a test case," rent commissioner Wayne Bauer said. "If (the 
landlords) aren't willing to open up their hearts for this woman and her 
children, then I think it signals they're not going to be concerned with 
helping low-income people." 
</P>
<P>
In June, Bauer spearheaded a compromise with several influential landlords for 
a program that would allow landlords to roughly double the rents on some 
vacated apartments if they set aside an equal number of apartments for 
low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
He and two other members of the rent board have favored the so-called 
Inclusionary Housing Program, with two remaining members of the panel opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, with the panel expected to vote in three weeks on whether to 
implement the program, Bauer has announced that he will "in all likelihood" 
change his mind and vote against the program unless a landlord comes forward to 
help Cartee. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has never met Cartee in person, having only talked with her by 
phone, and acknowledges that "this may not be the best way to do public 
policy," Bauer is adamant in his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see some good faith. I want a token. If I don't get an apartment for 
this woman, I will read that as a sign the program will be corrupted," he said. 
"It would signal that the landlords are going to be more interested in filling 
low-income apartments with their friends and relatives rather than with the 
people who really need help." 
</P>
<P>
But landlords, citing the scarcity of three- and four-bedroom apartments in 
Santa Monica, accuse Bauer of being unreasonable, saying that he is demanding 
the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"(Cartee's) is a heart-rending story, but one case involving a woman with five 
children doesn't provide a measure of what any program can do," landlord James 
Baker said. "I think Wayne is just reacting a little emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who helped fashion the compromise program, is among a handful of 
landlords who say they will participate in the voluntary program if it becomes 
law. The overwhelming majority of Action, Santa Monica's largest landlord 
organization, is on record as opposing the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprised and Puzzled 
</P>
<P>
Amid such opposition, some landlords said last week that they were surprised 
and puzzled by Bauer's stand. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's trying to threaten us by killing inclusionary housing, that's hard to 
understand, since most of us don't want it anyway," said one landlord, who 
spoke on the condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, president of Action, called Bauer's position regarding the 
program disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been strangling landlords for 10 years with rent control that has created 
the housing shortage in Santa Monica, and yet he expects a small group of 
landlords to come up with a three- or four-bedroom unit for someone just like 
that," Lambert said. "That doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Cartee's troubles began in late May after she was notified by the Santa Monica 
Housing Authority that her long-awaited application for Section 8 housing 
assistance from the federal government had been approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given Certificate 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, she was given a certificate to present to landlords, guaranteeing 
government reimbursement on the rent of a three- or four-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Such certificates are considered valuable in Santa Monica, where their face 
value often represents more money to a landlord than he or she could otherwise 
collect as the maximum allowable rent under the city's strict rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
But Cartee, who had been on a Section 8 waiting list for more than a year, soon 
ran into a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to rent to a single mother with five children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything would be fine, and then they would hear, 'five children,' and 
suddenly, an apartment wouldn't be available anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Once, a landlord told her that an apartment she was shown was no longer 
available, but when a co-worker called three days later, the landlord offered 
to show the co-worker the same unit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, she said, "a landlord called twice to assure me that I had the 
apartment, but the next time we spoke, he suddenly was saying something 
different. I found out later that he rented it to a woman with only three 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
60-Day Extension 
</P>
<P>
When her certificate expired after 60 days early in July, she was able to get a 
60-day extension, the maximum allowable under HUD rules, but she was still 
unable to find a place. 
</P>
<P>
After the extension expired last week, she reapplied for Section 8 benefits, 
but with a waiting list of about 9,000 people, housing authority officials say 
that, even with her special circumstances, it may be nine months to two years 
before she has another chance. 
</P>
<P>
That was a bitter pill for Cartee, since she says she can no longer afford the 
$630-a-month rent she pays, without any assistance, for the cramped two-bedroom 
apartment in Palms that is home to her and the children, ages 2 1/2 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment became unaffordable two months ago, after she reluctantly cut 
back her hours as an office worker from 40 to 24 in order to continue to 
qualify for government-assisted medical care for herself and the children. She 
receives $313 a month in food stamps to supplement her $900 monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real Catch-22," she said. "If I continued to work full time, I wasn't 
considered medically needy enough to obtain Medi-Cal benefits for the kids. But 
now that I've voluntarily cut my income by $300 or $400 a month, I can't afford 
a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative is going on (Aid to Families with Dependent Children). But 
that doesn't appeal to me either. I don't want welfare payments. I just want to 
work, and be able to afford a decent place for the kids."

CONGREGATIONS TO GIVE THANKS FOR SHELTER THAT OVERCAME ODDS 
</P>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout the San Gabriel Valley, perhaps in as many as 200 churches, an 
identical prayer will be recited in services today . 
</P>
<P>
"We dedicate ourselves this day to caring for the needy of our community and of 
our world," the prayer begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Teach us that the beauty of this life and of this world comes nearer to us as 
we come nearer to our brothers and sisters in need," it continues. 
</P>
<P>
The prayer represents the spiritual side of a very material accomplishment: the 
opening of new quarters for Union Station, a soup kitchen and shelter for the 
homeless. After five years of work, a court battle and heated community 
opposition, the new building at 412 S. Raymond Ave. will finally open its doors 
in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The facility replaces the downtown soup kitchen founded 16 years ago by All 
Saints Episcopal Church, which still operates it as part of a coalition of 
church groups. 
</P>
<P>
The prayer also represents a commitment to help people such as Harry Taylor, a 
32-year-old ex-Marine from Detroit, who calls Union Station "the oasis." 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for this place here, a lot of people would be in a bad way," 
Taylor said last week during lunch at the soon-to-be-closed old Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
A trim, athletic-looking man, Taylor said alcohol and drugs reduced him to 
living on the streets after a fight with a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have seen me before," he said. "I was a wreck: beard, hair out to 
here, smelled like the dogs out on the street, aimless, no direction." 
</P>
<P>
Now, after counseling at Union Station, Taylor said he is ready to enter a drug 
rehabilitation program and set his life in order. He owes thanks to the Union 
Station staff, he said, and hopes to attend the dedication to help out as a 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people -- church members, public officials and homeless people 
such as Taylor -- are expected to attend the dedication today of the 
$1.2-million, two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
With its modern, stainless-steel kitchen and sunlit dining hall that seats 105 
people, the new Union Station will begin serving meals in another month. It 
replaces the windowless soup kitchen now run out of a tiny building at the 
corner of Euclid Avenue and Walnut Street, where the homeless rush to finish 
their meals in three shifts of 50 each. 
</P>
<P>
The new Union Station will also provide beds and showers for 36 men and women 
who will be able to launder their clothes in on-premise washing machines and 
dryers. It will be operated in conjunction with a 20-bed shelter already 
operating in the basement of the First Congregational Church. 
</P>
<P>
Located in an industrial neighborhood on a lot once occupied by a 
metal-recycling business, the soup kitchen will dedicate itself to recycling 
lives, said Union Station Foundation Director Bill Doulos. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other shelters that simply provide overnight accommodations for the 
destitute, Union Station screens its clientele to assess how they can be 
helped. Only highly motivated people hoping to enter mainstream society are 
allowed to move in. They can stay from two weeks to two months. 
</P>
<P>
The new space will enable the shelter to expand the staff from 15 to 20, Doulos 
said. Drug counseling, job referrals, health screening and other services will 
also be provided in the expanded office space, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't come in with assembly-line problems, and you just don't fix them 
and send them on their way," Doulos said. "Everything (in their lives) is 
disturbed when they come to us or they wouldn't be coming to us." 
</P>
<P>
It is precisely that which upset the shelter's neighbors-to-be, who rallied 
against the relocation. 
</P>
<P>
A group of residents headed by former actress Dovie DeVillagran protested the 
move in hearings before the Board of Directors in 1985. The neighbors feared 
that the operation would attract transients and crime to the area and that the 
homeless would sleep on the street when the shelter was full. 
</P>
<P>
The board decided in the shelter's favor, prompting eight nearby business 
owners to band together as the Old Pasadena Assn. and file a lawsuit, claiming 
that environmental concerns had not been addressed. After lower and appellate 
court decisions against them, the business owners finally gave up their fight. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the past opposition, Doulos said he believes the shelter may still 
have to prove itself to residents, despite restrictions placed on its operation 
four years ago by the board. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter is limited to serving a maximum of 225 meals daily and providing 
housing for no more than 40 people. Litter within 500 feet of the shelter must 
be picked up and a Union Station employee must be available daily to answer 
community complaints. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a committee of residents, city staff and Union Station employees 
will monitor the shelter, Doulos said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the critical eyes that will be on them, Doulos believes that the 
new location, with its modern accommodations, will lift the spirit of the 
homeless and provide even more incentive for people such as Taylor to get back 
on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned more here than I've learned in the last 32 years on Earth," 
Taylor said of Union Station. "I have purpose today."

SCIENTIST DREAMS OF WAYS FOR COMPUTERS TO THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his years of research, Caltech biophysicist John J. Hopfield has met a 
number of people who think like computers. But he has never met a computer that 
thinks like a human. 
</P>
<P>
The dizzying potential of such a machine has long intrigued him, however. A 
pioneer in the study of "thinking computers," Hopfield is fascinated by whether 
digital machines can be taught to process information in a manner similar to 
the human nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Caltech professor will give an open lecture at Claremont's 
Harvey Mudd College that probes the question "Can Computers Think?" Hopfield, 
who recently won the school's prestigious Wright Award, is also scheduled to 
hold a series of campus talks with students and faculty on Oct. 11 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to traditional computers, which process information sequentially, 
bit by bit, Hopfield designs neural networks, a vast matrix of interlinked 
computers, modeled after the human brain, that can communicate with each other 
and trade data all at once. Although the field is a fledgling one, Hopfield and 
others have laid the groundwork for radically new computers that could have 
enormous impact on technology. 
</P>
<P>
The field appears tailor-made for Hopfield, who strides comfortably through the 
realms of neurobiology, computer science, physics and mathematics and in 1983 
won a MacArthur Prize -- the so-called genius award. 
</P>
<P>
Hopfield, "has been a very major figure in the field for a long time," says 
James A. Anderson, a cognitive scientist at Brown University. "He produced a 
very simple model that's quite elegant." 
</P>
<P>
Winning the Wright Award, presented each year for leading research in 
interdisciplinary fields, also puts Hopfield in eminent company. Last year, the 
$20,000 award went to British scientist Francis H. Crick, who shared the Nobel 
Prize with James D. Watson in 1962 for his discovery of the molecular structure 
of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly, neural network research fell through the cracks of biology and 
computer science because it fit squarely in neither. But today, as scientists 
seek to design ever-smarter and more powerful computers, Hopfield is riding a 
growing wave of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a period in the 1970s when no one was paying much attention, except 
the hard core, such as Hopfield. He is responsible for the resurgence," 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work in Gray Areas 
</P>
<P>
Hopfield, a tall, lanky man of 56 who explains his theories in clear, graceful 
language, attributes his success to his exploration of the gray areas where no 
scientist has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
So do others. 
</P>
<P>
"Had he not asked questions in areas that were in the boundaries between 
disciplines, he wouldn't have made such a creative, profound contribution," 
said Stavros Busenberg, a mathematics professor at Harvey Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
All too often, however, traditional research methods have encouraged 
specialization at the expense of gaining fresh ideas from cross-pollination, 
Hopfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of rewards for someone who's at the center of his or her 
discipline. At the fringes, you don't have a built-in rooting section, and you 
wonder if anyone's really listening," Hopfield said. 
</P>
<P>
He has personal experience with this phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Disciplines 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in the Princeton physics department, they told me, 'We're sure what 
you're doing on the outskirts of biology is very interesting, but please don't 
tell us too many details.' " 
</P>
<P>
But that is all behind him. For the last decade, Hopfield has held a joint 
appointment in the departments of chemistry and biology at Caltech, a 
fringe-dweller's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Currently he teaches only one class, in neural networks. It is a task he 
relishes, because he can discuss ideas with students, and dreads, because it 
forces him to anticipate student questions and answer them first. 
</P>
<P>
But there are payoffs. In 1984, he says, on a flight home from an East Coast 
seminar on neural networks, fear of showing up unprepared for class prodded the 
Pasadena professor to construct a mathematical model that had long eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the interesting things I've done in my life have been the result of 
having to give a lecture very soon. It forces you to think deeply." 
</P>
<P>
Hopfield has been thinking deeply about the connection between computers and 
the human brain since 1969, when a scientist friend convinced him that he 
should combine his physicist's background with his interest in neurobiology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dim Ideas' Brightly Linked 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Hopfield signed up for seminars and collected information, 
slowly coming up with "the dim ideas that there was something collective about 
the way memory worked." 
</P>
<P>
Then, during three months in 1980, Hopfield made a connection between memory 
and neurobiology. But he says it took him several more years to come up with 
the idea of redesigning digital computers to reflect the architecture of the 
human brain. 
</P>
<P>
In one experiment, Hopfield and his associate, David Tank at Bell Labs in 
Holmdale, N.J., used a simulated neural network to solve the classic "traveling 
salesman" problem, which involves finding the most efficient route for a 
salesman to travel among a set of cities. 
</P>
<P>
Hopfield and Tank's solution was to design a circuit-board with a series of 
switches adjusted to represent the distances between cities. Using an 
electronic current, the computers worked in tandem, settling into a pattern 
that indicated the shortest route a thousand times faster than a digital 
computer, which would have to measure each route one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Than 100% Sure 
</P>
<P>
Like the human brain, the neural networks don't give the right answer 100% of 
the time, Hopfield says. But in the traveling salesman test, they gave the best 
answer 50% of the time and one of the two best answers 90% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, digital computers will always provide fast, efficient 
number-crunching -- a skill at which humans don't excel, Hopfield says. But 
they are just plain dumb when it comes to tasks that humans do effortlessly, 
such as recognizing people or voices. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a new breed of computer pioneered by Hopfield and others is learning 
through association, using building blocks of data and past experience to solve 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hopfield is working with a graduate student on a neural net system that will be 
able to hear words and distinguish them from garbled letters. When it hears a 
bona fide word, a bulb will light up. 
</P>
<P>
Such systems have many applications. Since 1986, hundreds of little companies 
have sprung up to try and build computers that apply the principles first 
articulated by Hopfield and a handful of others. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms want to design computers that read ZIP codes and check numbers; 
others see applications in analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes or 
search for oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pentagon Applications 
</P>
<P>
And a not-so-little group, the Pentagon, sees defense applications. Last year, 
it announced development of its own $33-million neural network system. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, says Hopfield, thinking computers remain in the science fiction 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Paraphrasing author and mythologist Joseph Campbell, Hopfield adds: At least 
for the near future, the computer is going to continue to seem like an Old 
Testament God, with lots of rules and little mercy.

SOVIET AND U.S. PANELISTS TRADE GAGS IN PARLEY ON TRENDS IN HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's in: bureaucrats, punks, pollution, stone-washed jeans, Stalin. What's 
out: Gorby, glasnost, Americans. 
</P>
<P>
What's fair game for roasting nowadays in the Soviet Union was the hot topic 
last week at a symposium aimed at assessing the state of the wit in the two 
countries and how humor reflects social and cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one more step in demystifying the 'Evil Empire," said American 
stand-up comedian Paul Krassner, who sat on a discussion panel last Wednesday 
at Antioch University Southern California in Marina del Rey. Also on the panel 
were American professors of humor and visiting Soviet humor magazine editors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Day Visit 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet editors stopped on the Westside for two days as part of the Second 
Soviet/American Exchange of Humorists. The traveling humor summit, which also 
ventured to Virginia, Nebraska and New York state in its two weeks, was 
sponsored by the semi-satirical International Assn. of Professional 
Bureaucrats, a Washington-based organization that, according to its president, 
Jim Boren, is dedicated to dynamic inaction. The exchange was to continue 
Thursday night at UCLA with another panel featuring George Carlin. Next year, 
Americans will head to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The first such round of visits, in 1987 and 1988, included Americans Art 
Buchwald and Jim Berry. 
</P>
<P>
Political satire is the primary form of humor in the Soviet Union, and the 
Soviet delegation reflected that. Represented were three official publications 
that conferees likened to National Lampoon and England's Punch and Private Eye. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow-based Krokodil (crocodile), the largest humor magazine in the Soviet 
Union, is published every 10 days; its circulation is 5.3 million, out of the 
country's 287 million people. Editor Leonid Florentiev said the magazine, like 
its namesake, "bites, as a humor magazine should." 
</P>
<P>
The two other magazines have equally pointed names: Peretz (pepper), from the 
Ukraine, and Pikker (a lance), from Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost, or openness, has affected almost everything in Soviet life including 
what gets a laugh, said Florentiev, at 35 among the youngest of Krokodil's 16 
editors. Florentiev said censorship exists only "inside our editors in chief, . 
. . and that decides whether the magazine is brave or not brave." But, he said, 
"Your psychology cannot change overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Current targets for roasting include individual politicians -- dead and alive 
-- and the Communist Party, the visitors said, and their magazines snipe at 
certain ministers for incompetence and the Central Committee for its posh 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government's penchant for secrecy provides fodder as well. One joke 
making the rounds recently has former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko asking 
Leonid Brezhnev, "What do we do about these foreign correspondents, who lie 
about us?" 
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev replies: "If they're lies, they're OK. But if they start speaking the 
truth, get them out of the country in 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fertile Fields 
</P>
<P>
Satirists also fire at corruption, vice, alcoholism, crime and environmental 
problems as well as the black market, Florentiev says. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Krokodil cartoon shows devils stirring a vat of stone-washed jeans, 
the latest craze in the Soviet Union. Harvey Mindess, an Antioch professor of 
psychology of humor who coordinated the visitors' Westside stay, said he sees a 
difference in what gets a laugh among Soviets just since the last conference 
two years ago. Discussing Playboy's bawdy humor, for example at that time made 
the Soviet delegation uneasy. This time, they roared. And Kaido Liiva, 
editor-in-chief of Pikker, showed some risque cartoons from his own magazine. 
</P>
<P>
These Soviet humorists -- except for editor Andrey Benyukh -- were not the same 
delegates that attended two years ago. According to Krassner, even the body 
language this time was looser. "They kept whispering to each other the last 
time, to make sure they were following party line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As in America, the Soviets have some old standards. 
</P>
<P>
An old woman is sitting on a Moscow street corner, with an empty shopping bag. 
"I've become so old, I don't remember -- did I go to the store, or am I going 
to the store?" Benyukh, Krokodil deputy foreign editor, said the joke is 
decades old but "now the (shortage) situation is so bad, that (it) is up to 
date." 
</P>
<P>
Underground jokes have sprouted above ground. Liiva told of the emigrating 
Soviet waiting at the airport. As he waits for his flight, he hears an 
announcement: "The party delegation is leaving for abroad." A bit later, 
there's another announcement: "The delegation from the Youth Communist League 
is leaving." The man waits some more; the next announcement is, "The trade 
union delegation is leaving." The man turns to another would-be emigre and 
says, "Now it makes sense to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Range of Topics 
</P>
<P>
Recent Krokodil issues show the range of humor in Russia: everything from 
cartoons to poetry to articles, poking fun at aging politicians, the Soviet 
drug problem, rock music, artists and liubers, gangs of hooligans from the 
suburbs who beat up Muscovites. 
</P>
<P>
A punker has a scrub-brush for a Mohawk. A long-haired hippie with beads and a 
peace-sign chain meditates -- picturing a cooked chicken. There's even a Gary 
Larson cartoon of two fleas on a dog's back, checking a map of the dog that 
tells them, "You are here." 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost has made some humor passe. Benyukh gave as an example the tale about 
three Russians sitting on a park bench. The first one sighs; the second one 
says, 'Oh," and the third says: "Are you crazy? You have to really be more 
careful in expressing your political views." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Western attacks have stopped, Florentiev says. "Our readers are pretty fed 
up with that kind of stuff," he said, adding that if the magazine wants to take 
stabs at the West, it now uses American cartoons for that. Ethnic jokes are 
out, because of the y situation with the various nationalities in the Soviet 
Union that have increased their calls for autonomy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The editors say their job has become more difficult in some ways because under 
glasnost, newspapers also are doing satire. "The competition is much greater 
than we had before," Florentiev said. Before, the humor magazines stood alone, 
and "it was easy to be on top of the interests of the audience. Now, everybody 
seems to be very sharp," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost-era humor does have its sacred cows, however, among them glasnost 
itself. "I don't feel any euphoria about the situation," Florentiev said. 
"We've got a long way to go before we consider ourselves a real democracy. But 
the change is dramatic, and Mikhail Gorbachev has done a great job. " He added 
that the parliament is considering a draft law that would increase freedom of 
speech, and he thinks it will pass. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking glasnost, therefore, would be suicidal, he said. "If we attack 
glasnost and perestroika, it can be used by the conservatives to undermine 
Gorbachev's influence." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Gorbachev has been spared, though even that is changing. Benyukh 
related this one-liner: Gorbachev was just a party leader before, but now is a 
party leader and president -- "because he understood the impossibility of 
surviving on one salary in our country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gags With National Flavor 
</P>
<P>
Panelists exchanged jokes about each other's countries. They generally hit the 
other country's funny bone, but some missed. Such as an obscure Soviet story 
about Brezhnev and poet Alexander Pushkin. And an American joke about various 
groups of Soviet citizens waiting for a share of a phantom shipment of oranges. 
The visitors politely laughed but later said it was only "so-so." 
</P>
<P>
Stand-up comics of the American sort are not found in the Soviet Union, said 
the Soviet humorists. Instead, satirical writers read their work -- and fill 
1,000-seat auditoriums, earning 5,000 rubles (about $8,000 on the official 
exchange in the devalued Soviet economy, $500 on the black market) a 
performance, according to the Soviet humorists. 
</P>
<P>
And as for movies and television comedies, Florentiev says, "watching the 
Soviet parliament in session on TV is enough humor." 
</P>
<P>
American comedians known in their country, the Russians said, include Billy 
Crystal (whose recent visit to Moscow was a success, they said), Eddie Murphy, 
Bill Cosby and Art Buchwald (whose articles have run in Pikker and Krokodil). 
Woody Allen has God-like status: "It would be interesting to get to know Woody 
Allen -- we know very little about him," said Liiva. Allen is "much more 
intellectual than other humorists," Benyukh said. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of National Lampoon and Mad magazine are as rare in the Soviet Union as 
Krokodil, Pikker and Peretz are in America. Benyukh said Krokodil editors do 
subscribe to Time and USA Today -- and to Readers Digest. "(Readers Digest) 
used to be Reagan's favorite -- we're interested in what he finds humorous," he 
said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation found plenty to laugh at in America. A tour of a jail in 
Alexandria, Va., prompted Florentiev's observation that "maybe we have worse 
prisons, but we have many more." Benyukh was particularly tickled by Zsa Zsa 
Gabor on trial for slapping a Beverly Hills cop. 
</P>
<P>
And in the true spirit of glasnost, Benyukh came supplied with a joke that he 
insisted was Moscow-born: 
</P>
<P>
 A Moscow man gets home at 6 a.m., after a long night at work and several 
drinks. He's drunk; he dreads going home because his wife will chew him out, 
and he's tired of his life of drudgery. Then a strange thing happens. A white 
Mercedes-Benz pulls up, and a gentleman in a white suit asks him, "Hey, guy, 
where's the nearest striptease, with drinks and with gambling?" The Muscovite 
answers: "In L.A."

REPORT DEFENDS PASADENA MINORITY HIRING 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's affirmative action efforts place it on a par with other California 
cities that have large minority populations, according to a city report 
released last week. 
</P>
<P>
The report, by Affirmative Action Director Ramon Curiel, was prepared after 
black and Latino activists complained that Pasadena has failed to aggressively 
hire and promote minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
Curiel compared the city's work force to municipal labor forces in Fresno, 
Glendale, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Pomona, Riverside, Sacramento and 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
With a minority population of 53.7% and a minority city work force of 50.4%, 
Pasadena ranked fifth among the 10 cities surveyed in terms of population 
parity. 
</P>
<P>
Population parity is the placement of minorities in city jobs in percentages 
equaling their percentage in the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
Among the four cities with a 50% or higher minority population -- Los Angeles, 
Pasadena, Oakland and Pomona -- only Los Angeles made more progress in 
population parity than Pasadena, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
As in most of the other 10 cities, Pasadena's minorities are not equally 
represented in all types of jobs, the report said. Pasadena reached parity in 
only three of eight federally defined job categories for all its minorities: 
service-maintenance, paraprofessional and office-clerical. 
</P>
<P>
From his analysis, Curiel concluded that the city's affirmative action progress 
"is as good as, and, in other cases, much better than other California cities 
with significant minority populations." 
</P>
<P>
But the city's affirmative action efforts were dubbed as only "adequate" by 
Ibrahim Naeem, director of the Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Los Angeles 
Urban League and one of those who appeared before the council two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I compliment the city for the improvements they've made, but they certainly 
have some areas they need to work on," Naeem said, referring to the lack of 
women and minorities in certain job categories. 
</P>
<P>
"The city doesn't appear to have the right commitment to give promotions and a 
career track to those people," Naeem said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was a response to demands made two weeks ago before the Board of 
Directors. The speakers addressed concerns that they said had previously been 
brought up and inadequately answered in August during a board meeting at the 
Jackie Robinson Center. 
</P>
<P>
Among the demands was a request that the city expand a proposed count of 
Armenian-Americans to include other minority groups. The special count was 
recently approved by the board because the 1990 U.S. Census will not list 
population numbers for Armenians, a group included in the city's affirmative 
action efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and Latinos, who say they are typically undercounted by the Census, fear 
they will be shortchanged on social services if Armenian-Americans are 
accurately counted. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Curiel suggested that the city's Affirmative Action Commission 
review the issue for later recommendations to the board, a suggestion approved 
by the board last week. 
</P>
<P>
Curiel also addressed concerns expressed by Antonia Darder, a Latina, who 
questioned the city's affirmative action commitment after she failed to secure 
an interview for an entry-level administrative job. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 55 applicants for the position, Curiel reported that 67.9% were 
minorities. In addition, eight of the 10 finalists were minorities and the 
three final candidates were minorities.

COUNTY AGAIN APPLIES FOR STATE FUNDS FOR BUILDING BIKE PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is seeking 
$800,000 in state funds to begin construction of a bike path that would 
eventually extend 14 miles from the San Gabriel River to Temple Avenue in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the California Department of Parks and Recreation denied the county 
the money needed for the first phase of the San Jose Creek Bikeway, which if 
completed would serve Bassett, Hacienda Heights, Industry, La Puente, Rowland 
Heights, Pomona, Walnut and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The bikeway would connect to the existing San Gabriel River Regional Bikeway. 
</P>
<P>
The county is also asking for $50,000 to improve access gates and asphalt ramps 
at locations along the San Gabriel River, Los Angeles River and Rio Hondo 
trails, which lead to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
After voters approved Proposition 70 in June, 1988, the department set aside a 
total of $776 million for recreational projects. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Willd-Wagner, grants administrator for the department, said she had 
received the county's application for money from the California Wildlife, 
Coastal and Park Land Conservation Bond Act funds. But only $2.5 million is 
available for trails construction throughout the state, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"To get $800,000 is unrealistic," Willd-Wagner said. "That's one-third of the 
entire amount."

HUMANE SOCIETY AWARDED CUSTODY OF SEIZED FOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena Municipal Court commissioner has refused to return eight Arctic 
foxes to an Altadena woman who was arrested last January for keeping the wild 
animals in her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Warren C. Haas on Tuesday awarded custody of the foxes to the 
Pasadena Humane Society, where they have been living behind a chain-link fence 
in a concrete-floored kennel for the last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Steve McNall, executive director of the society, said he would try to place the 
gray-and-white kits, which are native to Alaska, in a zoo or wildlife education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
State game officials seized the animals on Jan. 24 from the home of Cheryl 
Moraga, 36, who said she had purchased two adult foxes as pets from an animal 
broker about five years ago. She said she never intended for the foxes to 
breed, but when they did, she said she cared for the kits as if they were her 
own children. 
</P>
<P>
Although the foxes are not endangered or particularly rare, they are classified 
as exotic animals in California and are illegal to keep without a permit, state 
game officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Moraga, who was also charged with possessing marijuana after game wardens saw 
about a dozen plants growing in her back yard, was fined $235 and sentenced to 
one year probation.

DUARTE REVISES GENERAL PLAN FOR NEXT CENTURY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of work, the City Council has adopted a revised General Plan 
that will act as a guide for the city's growth into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan is intended to encourage commercial development along with 
residential development to support and supplement the new businesses, said 
Community Development Director Ed Cox. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning for 19 areas in the community was changed in the revised plan. Among 
those changed were three parcels of land that had attracted significant public 
interest in the month before the council's adoption of the plan late last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted not to approve a zone change in the new plan that would 
have been necessary for a developer's proposal to build an Arco gas station and 
24-hour convenience store at Buena Vista Street and Duarte Road. Instead, they 
zoned the property, which once was the site of a Chevron service station, 
residential rather than commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 370 residents had signed petitions or written letters protesting the 
proposal to build the store. The city staff also recommended that the area be 
zoned residential instead of commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Ontal Jr., assistant to the city manager, said the residents opposed to 
the convenience store contended that another market was not needed in the area 
and that would draw "undesirables" because it was open 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said that, because there are two markets across the street from the 
proposed convenience store, the staff recommended the residential designation, 
which would support existing businesses rather than compete with them. 
</P>
<P>
As a last effort to block the opposition, Arco representatives promised that 
the convenience store would not sell beer or wine. But the council was not 
swayed. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning for Duarte Road, west of Buena Vista, was also the subject of 
controversy. A glass and chemical company now operates there next to 
single-family homes. Council members approved rezoning the area from commercial 
to residential. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said that the light-industrial plant has had a history of odor and spill 
problems and that the new zoning for apartments or condominiums would eliminate 
these problems for future residents. The plant has 20 years to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
Once the plant vacates the property, new housing will act as a buffer between 
the residents to the north and railroad tracks to the south, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also approved rezoning the area on Huntington Drive northeast 
of Mt. Olive from commercial to residential. The Trails restaurant, which is 
located in the rezoned area, will be allowed to remain. 
</P>
<P>
The process of revising the General Plan began two years ago with the Duarte 
Resurgence Strategic Plan committee. The group, made up of 70 residents and 
business people, worked on five committees that focused on the city's needs and 
outlined recommendations for changes. 
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan was then submitted to the council. The newly revised General 
Plan follows many of the group's planning and zoning ideas.

OUTTAKES: TOUGH BOOKING?

<P>
Will the right-wing government of El Salvador give "Romero" its blessing? The 
film, depicting the political transformation and eventual assassination in 1980 
of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, portrays the government as brutally 
oppressive to all political reformists, Marxist or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros., handling foreign sales, has an exec in Latin America making play 
dates for the film. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think it will be a controversial issue (with the El Salvadoran 
government)," said a Warner Bros. publicity exec. "It may never play there. We 
just don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
But Jose Trigueros, a trade attache with the Salvadoran embassy in D.C., 
predicted otherwise: "It has not been raised as an issue. The ambassador has 
gone to see it. He had some comments -- it's not entirely factual -- but he had 
no problems with it. We are open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
Another source close to the country's political situation questioned whether El 
Salvador's ruling Arena party, which controls the military and has been linked 
to death squad activity, would OK "Romero": "In that atmosphere, how much 
pressure would it take to keep a theater from showing a movie so critical of 
the government?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Warner Bros. will try to book "Romero" in Mexico this spring to 
coincide with the Pope's planned visit. Said the Warner Bros. spokesman: "It's 
a good hook. We can build some good publicity around it." John M. Wilson

Warning to Hollywood studios: Condom manufacturers can advertise on TV, but 
references to prophylactics in commercials for movies are a no-no with the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America, which controls advertising and ratings for the 
film industry. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Ray Stark has faced the MPAA's condom taboo with his upcoming "Steel 
Magnolias" for Tri-Star. In an original spot for the film, newlywed Julia 
Roberts is startled to find that friends have decorated the wedding car with 
inflated condoms. Mom (Sally Field) comforts Roberts by telling her the condoms 
will remind her of the importance of safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
CBS OKd the "Steel Magnolias" commercial for viewing after 9 p.m., but the MPAA 
nixed it. 
</P>
<P>
MPAA's Bethlyn Hand, who supervises the review of such advertising, explained 
that independent stations with more liberal standards might have aired the spot 
in earlier time periods. "Advertising must be suited for a general audience," 
she added. "Parents must find nothing objectionable." 
</P>
<P>
Stark protested the edict in a letter to Hand: "(Condom) is a word that may not 
be part of the everyday vernacular at the MPAA office in Sherman Oaks, but it 
is one propelled into the spotlight by the Surgeon General, by sex educators, 
(etc.)," Stark wrote. 
</P>

Hand told us the spot may yet air -- with "condom" bleeped out. Nina J. Easton

With ticket sales in excess of $100 million, a sequel to Disney's "Honey, I 
Shrunk the Kids" is a foregone conclusion. Not so definite: the direction in 
which it'll be headed.

<P>
To cover its bases, Disney's registered these titles with the MPAA: "Honey, I 
Can't Get the Kids Out of My Head," "Honey, I Turned the Kids Into Animals," 
"Honey, I Turned the Kids Into Giants," "Honey, I Faxed the Kids," "Honey, I

Producer John Davis got a mixed message at a test screening of "Enid is 
Sleeping" last week: The opening scene had some viewers laughing -- and others 
marching out in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The scene in question: A little girl puts her baby sister into an oven and 
turns on the gas, followed by a lingering interior shot of the infant as the 
oven heats up. The black comedy -- which stars Judge Reinhold and Elizabeth 
Perkins -- then reveals that both sisters have survived to adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the scene was included to show "the genesis of the sibling rivalry 
between the two sisters." 
</P>
<P>
"It may or may not end up in the picture," the producer added. "This is a very 
preliminary cut . . . the whole movie could be different in two weeks." 
</P>

Produced last year by now-defunct Vestron Pictures, "Enid" is currently looking 
for a distributor. Stacy Jenel Smith

San Francisco Giants slugger Will (The Thrill) Clark has his own theme song (if 
you call his answering machine, it plays B.B. King's "The Thrill is Gone"). Not 
to be outdone, the Chicago Cubs (the Giants play-off rivals) have a theme of 
their own. Rhino Records is rushing out a 12-inch single called "The Cubbies 
Are Rockin'," a rap celebration of the Cubs' prowess by M.C. Gary and D.J. 
Barry (AKA veteran musician Barry Goldberg). The song's lyrics go in part: 
"Walton and Smith, man, they got the speed, with Sandberg and Grace what more 
do we need, Bielecki and Maddux firing away, Sutcliffe on the mound, what more 
can we say . . . " The flip-side is "The Addison Sheffield Shuffle," a tribute 
to a pair of streets adjacent to Wrigley Field. . . . And on the blues-front: 
National Public Radio's "Bluesstage" debuts Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KPCC-FM, 
featuring a series of live R&amp;B recordings, beginning with a Dr. John show 
from the Village Gate.

EMPEROR ROSKO RULES HIS REALM FROM AFAR; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS DISC JOCKEY REACHES LISTENERS IN 27 COUNTRIES BUT YEARNS TO ADD 
L.A. TO HIS DOMAIN

"I've been the No. 1 DJ in Paris and the No. 1 DJ in London," says Mike 
Pasternak, alias Emperor Rosko. "I'd like to become the No. 1 DJ in L.A., but 
that's no easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak sits in the broadcasting studio in his Thousand Oaks home. Around him 
is all the right equipment -- turntables, CD player, sound effects gadgets. 
Stacked against the wall are newly released records, sent gratis from labels in 
the U.S. and Europe. He even has fan mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Rosko, 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks ago I sended you a letter -- don't you receive it? I think you 
get it shortly. Rosko, you are so manly. I've got your pictures and your voice 
on my tape-recording -- my friends are very jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pasternak won't be meeting Monika, the letter-writer, at a personal 
appearance. He won't be taking dedications from her or any other listeners. 
Emperor Rosko does reign, but only in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Monika lives in Poland and hears him over Radio Luxembourg. Other fans listen 
on the BBC's Radio 1 or on Swiss Romande. Pasternak produces the programs -- 
some of them weekly, some of them specials -- in Thousand Oaks and mails the 
tapes overseas. Many of his contacts were made during stints as a DJ in England 
and France -- successful stints that have failed to translate into a major 
radio career in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak, 46, spent nearly two years in 1966-67 as a disc jockey on the 
original pirate station, Radio Caroline, a ship that broadcast off the coast of 
England. The station had no government licenses and paid no taxes and spawned a 
number of imitators. From 1969 to 1975, he hosted "World Service Countdown," a 
BBC program styled after "American Top 40." The British edition of Billboard 
magazine named him top European DJ of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell a thousand stories about the pirate radio days," he said. "It was 
both very exciting and very boring, because we'd do two weeks on the ship and 
one week off. Sometimes there was absolutely nothing to do. So we'd say on the 
air, 'If you support Radio Caroline, drive to the cliffs tonight and turn on 
your headlamps.' They'd do it, and it was a tremendous thing to see." 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak was introduced to Europe at an early age. The son of movie producer 
Joe Pasternak ("Where the Boys Are," "The Great Caruso"), he was born and 
educated in Los Angeles but also attended boarding schools in Switzerland and 
Paris. He said his years overseas have helped him understand his audience's 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
At various times Emperor Rosko has recrowned himself Kaiser Rosko or Le 
President Rosko. He gives listeners a mix of U.S. and European music, celebrity 
interviews and entertainment news delivered in a zany, manic style. A typical 
set might include some Beatles tunes, more recent oldies by such people as 
Bronski Beat and new music; an interview with Cyndi Lauper, and a contest in 
which listeners identify songs from snippets. 
</P>
<P>
"I read everything from The Times to the National Enquirer to get my material, 
although 80% of it is from the Enquirer end of the scale," Pasternak said. "I 
sell the image of Palm Springs and Malibu. As far as they're concerned, I'm at 
the beach." 
</P>
<P>
To foster that impression, Emperor Rosko mixes the sound of sea gulls and surf 
into some of his broadcasts. Rather than a Thousand Oaks address, he uses a 
post office box on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. And he does not let facts 
hinder the creativity of his reporting. Two days before a jury convicted Zsa 
Zsa Gabor of slapping a Beverly Hills policeman, Emperor Rosko reported the 
guilty verdict on a tape mailed to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I just knew she couldn't get away with it, so I went with my instincts," 
Pasternak said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Luxembourg, with its high-powered transmitter, broadcasts Emperor Rosko 
to 27 countries. Pasternak has gotten mail from as far away as Russia and 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"It does sound you are really enjoying yourself," writes Phil Davson from 
Switzerland in a recent letter. "Yes, it's definitely a happening show on Luxy 
-- probably the only happening show." 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak does the "Luxy" show in English. Programs for France are done in 
French. 
</P>
<P>
He makes liberal use of horns and whistles and often closes with: "Emperor 
Roscoe has enjoyed himself, my subjects. My padded cell awaits me now." 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak has been exporting programs to Europe for 10 years, ever since he 
moved back to California. He said he left Europe to attempt a U.S. radio career 
and also to be near his father, who has been ill. 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak said the shows take two days a week to produce, and he fleshes out 
his living as a mobile disc jockey. He provides music at weddings and other 
parties and performs at personal appearances by Casey Kasem. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey does the first 15 minutes, gets all the attention, and I do the rest," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best DJs around," Kasem said. "I've used him many times at 
dances. He puts together sets so that he gets young and old on their feet and 
keeps them there. He mixes both oldies and new songs." 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak fell under radio's spell while growing up in the 1950s and '60s. He 
borrowed his on-air moniker from a black Los Angeles disc jockey, Bill Mercer, 
who called himself Rosko. He also admired Johnny Hayes, Wolfman Jack and, in 
San Francisco, Bob Mitchell and Tom Donaghue. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfman influence is evident, as Emperor Rosko's voice often takes on a 
raspy sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a show with Wolf on the BBC," Pasternak recalled. "I take him off pretty 
good, so we had a contest to see if anyone could tell us apart. They couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Pasternak is divorced and has no children. He said radio occupies the central 
place in his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always my love," he said. "I could have been an actor. My dad was a 
producer. But I loved the music. I loved rapping along with the rhythm of the 
songs." 
</P>
<P>
He also enjoyed the interplay with audiences, taking calls and dedications. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to have that kind of fun with people is the ultimate trip," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But with an ocean and a continent separating Emperor Rosko and his subjects, 
the immediacy is lost. "L.A. is the toughest town in the world for a DJ," he 
said. "Everybody comes here. Maybe to make it you have to be able to sell 
yourself better than I can. Sometimes I wish I could stick a transmitter on the 
roof of my house and just broadcast from here."

NIGHT MOVES: AT BEOGRAD, ROBUST FOOD, REVELRY TRANSLATE INTO ONE WORD: 
YUGOSLAVIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You might not know Marshall Josip Tito from Archduke Francis Ferdinand. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you've never entertained the notion of pljeskavica or raznjici. 
</P>
<P>
But consider, for a moment, Yugoslavia's robust wines, filo dough, stuffed meat 
pastries and Serbo-Croatian folk songs crooned by the Balkans' answer to Frank 
Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietors of Beograd, a restaurant and nightclub in North Hollywood, have 
given all of these Yugoslavian amenities a great deal of consideration. The 
bland exterior of the restaurant, in a mini-mall near Magnolia and Cahuenga 
boulevards, gives little indication of the Slavic delights that lie within. 
</P>
<P>
The food is tasty, hearty and reasonably priced. The service is friendly 
without being overbearing. And where else in Los Angeles can you and your loved 
ones get serenaded by Zvomko Mitrovic, a pinstripe-suited Yugoslavian who puts 
his big Croatian heart into the songs he belts out to packed crowds each Friday 
and Saturday night? 
</P>
<P>
In the year since Ljijana Javorina and Vojkan Kalnic opened Beograd, the 
nondescript corner has turned into a little slice of Yugoslavia on weekend 
nights, attracting Americans as well as Montenegrans, Serbs, Croats and other 
representatives of Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous provinces who 
come to rekindle memories of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be surprised if some of your fellow diners jump to their feet in the 
midst of their chicken Paprikash, link hands and begin dancing an ethnic 
fast-step that takes them in a half-circle around the room. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beograd opens at 5 p.m, things don't really kick into gear until about 
10:30 p.m. Sometimes the revelry extends late into the night. One recent Sunday 
morning at 1:30, the musicians were still singing to a packed (and rapt) house. 
</P>
<P>
Javorina and Kalnic used to own Yugoslavian Village, a now-closed restaurant on 
Barham Boulevard near Cahuenga. Kalnic, who often plays accordion in the house 
band, is in contact with musician friends he left behind in Belgrade 17 years 
ago. As a result, Beograd is a showcase for visiting Yugoslavian musicians, who 
come to Los Angeles for six-week stints. The revolving door ensures that 
singers know the newest Slavic pop songs in addition to more traditional fare. 
And there's no cover. 
</P>
<P>
One night, an accordion player from Belgrade coaxed unusual, vibrato-like 
sounds from his instrument, and Mitrovic's vocals evoked the quavering 
plaintive singing one associates with Islamic music. The band can switch to 
rousing polkas at the drop of a hat. Drum machines are verboten, and Mitrovic 
works the room like a celebrity entertainer in Las Vegas, maneuvering from 
table to table, trailing a long microphone cord, and trading jokes with the 
crowd in Serbo-Croatian. 
</P>
<P>
Since Yugoslavia was cobbled together after World War I from the republics of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Slovenia and Croatia and two 
autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo, Yugoslavian cuisine, like its 
music, is really a melange of influences. But dieters be warned -- this is not 
low-cal food. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners run from $9.95 to $13.95 for specials and include a tomato-based spicy 
fish soup or salad that comes with "mysterious Yugoslavian dressing," according 
to a waitress. This translated into a salad of crisp romaine with what tasted 
like a Caesar dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken breasts came stuffed with feta cheese, rolled in nutty-tasting bread 
crumbs and fried, accompanied by sauteed peppers, carrots, rice and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
And the pljeskavica? That's a mixture of ground pork, beef, lamb and bell 
peppers served on a bed of onions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the desserts, palacsinka -- stuffed crepe suzettes topped with a 
chocolate sauce -- stands out. 
</P>
<P>
Beograd also offers strong, 12%-alcohol Yugoslavian beer for $3.50, mineral 
water, Turkish coffee and a variety of "Jugoslavian" wines at $11.95 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Javorina, who has worked in restaurants for 25 years and does most of the 
cooking, says she plans to get a Yugoslavian publishing house to start sending 
over some Belgrade newspapers to make her Slavic customers feel at home. 
</P>
<P>
But whether you're a Serb or an Angeleno, "When you come here, you feel like 
you are in Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
Beograd, 10540 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, is open from 5 to 10 p.m. 
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday; from 5 p.m. until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday. 
Visa and MasterCard accepted. (818) 766-8689.

PLAYWRIGHT SEEKS A SECOND CHANCE IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen years ago, Jack Heifner was hot. 
</P>
<P>
His play, "Vanities," was already a huge success Off Broadway, newly mounted at 
the Mark Taper Forum, and on its way to national companies in San Francisco, 
Washington, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I was offered all kinds of TV series and movies," the Texas native recalled in 
his gentle drawl. "Things like the movie of 'Grease,' or a new series Lorimar 
was developing called 'Dallas.' But I turned them all down -- and ran off to 
Europe for six months." 
</P>
<P>
Fame had come fast and hard. "Vanities" was only his second play; its success 
had suddenly taken him into the Big Time. 
</P>
<P>
"In one respect, it was a lack of guidance," Heifner said of his decision to 
pass on the local offers and return to his New York base. "Sure, a lot of 
people were giving me advice then -- too many people. I mean, I was scared. I 
had no idea what to do. And since my background had always been in theater, New 
York seemed the safest place. There was a time, you know, when you could get TV 
work out of New York, pick up a pilot every couple of years. It's not like that 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
So now, at age 43, Heifner is back in town, reintroducing himself to the 
television and movie community. "This is where the money is," he said 
unabashedly. "I'm one of those fortunate people who's really made a living in 
theater; a day doesn't go by that 'Vanities' isn't performed somewhere around 
the country. But I'd rather be here now. I want a house. . . . So last summer, 
I changed agents. And now I've just started making appointments. If I can get 
new work here, I'll move." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Heifner hopes to use as a calling card is a new production of 
"Vanities," opening Wednesday at the Tamarind Theatre in Hollywood. "You know, 
there are a lot of 24- to 27-year-olds in the business who don't remember a 
play from 13 years ago," he said. "Although it's a staple in college theater 
departments and acting classes, it's not a hot new play. So you never know what 
you're walking into in an appointment; sometimes there's no frame of reference. 
I've met people who've never been to a play." 
</P>
<P>
Heifner takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"My career as a playwright came very fast -- and then I had to go back and have 
some plays that weren't successful," he said. "I had to learn a lot after the 
fact." With such credits as "Patio/Porch," "Star Treatment" and the books for 
six musicals (including "Leader of the Pack"), Heifner seems to be on an 
upswing again; in the coming year, he'll have two plays mounted in New York: 
the musical "Beauty Shop Bop" and "Bargains," which had earlier been purchased 
by CBS for development as a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the enormous popularity of "Vanities," Heifner's favorite is his 
"Running on Empty." 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote it in 1980 during the big fuel crisis," he said. "It's been published 
for years and years -- there was a wonderful production in Houston -- but it's 
never really caught on. It's about ambition, greed, conspicuous consumption, 
how we've eaten everything up and used all the fuel, . . . and yet it's like a 
Noel Coward cocktail party going on, with pretend cocktails. It's also about 
love relationships: using up people, using up things. It's the only one I've 
written that's really a political play." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Vanities" initially took flak for not being political enough. "People 
forget that this was a real controversial play," he said. The story takes three 
Southern women in the '60s and '70s through their high school and college years 
to adulthood. "It came out around the time of 'Sticks and Bones,' and the first 
few plays about the Vietnam War. Those were about people who cared desperately 
-- about the protests, the soldiers, the fighting." 
</P>
<P>
He sighed. "I wrote about three people who didn't give a damn, who were 
self-involved, who cared about their own vanities. This was also at the height 
of the feminist movement; women used to come up to me in the lobby and say, 
'How dare you write this play?' There was a feeling I was making fun of them. 
</P>
<P>
"People also didn't trust that you could put three women on stage and be 
interesting. But the universal reason the play works is 'cause the core is 
about friendship. We've all had friends, all grown apart from friends we were 
close to." 
</P>
<P>
Heifner also has a fondness for his first play, "Casserole." 
</P>
<P>
"Being a typical first play, you try to say everything you've ever wanted to 
say in your life," he said cheerfully. "It was such a mess. Actually, it was 
the funniest thing I've probably ever written -- and the most irreverent. It's 
about funerals, how no one gets around to burying the body because the 
neighbors keep bringing food." 
</P>
<P>
On opening night at Playwrights Horizons, Heifner said, "I was terrified . . . 
but when people started laughing, I thought, 'Maybe I can write.' So I went 
home, stayed up all night, and wrote 'Vanities.' " 
</P>
<P>
The path to playwriting had not been without detours. 
</P>
<P>
At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Heifner was a business major -- 
then an art major, then a theater major. In 1969, he landed his first 
post-college job assisting costume designer Theoni Aldredge at the New York 
Shakespeare Festival; when the dresses he'd made came apart at the seams on 
stage, he beat a hasty retreat out the stage door. 
</P>
<P>
He also spent time as a stage manager, market researcher and actor. "I wanted 
to go to New York and be in a Broadway show," he said. "Within a year, I had my 
Equity card. I thought, 'Well, that was easy.' " 
</P>
<P>
When "Vanities" hit, that seemed awfully easy, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you learn about the business, how rotten show business can be," he said 
dryly of the subsequent come-down. "But 'Vanities' had the advantage of running 
for five years in New York. So for five years I was still very visible. And I 
guess I never thought it would close. I always had this play running down the 
street I could drop in on. So that was probably the hardest thing -- when 
suddenly it wasn't there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
One thing he's secure about is how "Vanities" should be done. "About five years 
ago I directed it for a summer theater in Hyde Park, N.Y.," Heifner recalled. 
"We went back to it and said, 'Is there anything we missed?' And because we 
were older, we probably took the play a lot deeper. So when I talk to these 
actresses about it now, I think I might not be of much help to them -- because 
I know the play so well. Still, I don't want to go in and tell them how to do 
it. It's better to let them surprise me."

Typhoon Angela roared through the northern part of the main island of Luzon in 
the Philippines, killing at least 26 people and leaving another 40 missing, 
relief officials said. The storm, with winds over 100 m.p.h., caused heavy 
damage to structures and crops, with about 8,500 people being forced from their 
homes. The 26 who were killed drowned when floodwaters swept through their 
homes in the coastal town of Gonzaga, 270 miles north of Manila. Detailed 
damage and casualty reports from remote areas may take days or weeks to reach 
Manila, the capital, because of ruptured communications.

At least 13 people were arrested in San Rafael when more than 250 protesters on 
both sides of the abortion issue staged an early morning demonstration outside 
a Planned Parenthood clinic, police said. Lt. Ken Homen said those arrested 
were charged with trespassing. The demonstrators were "hollering a lot" but 
otherwise were not unruly, Homen said. Operation Rescue spokeswoman Judy Hockel 
said her group hoped to persuade women not to have abortions. Jessica Braverman 
of the National Organization for Women, said her supporters were there to 
demonstrate against the Operation Rescue group.

Greece's coalition government resigned, having fulfilled its goal of ordering 
former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and five other former Socialist 
ministers to stand trial on corruption charges. Prime Minister Tzannis 
Tzannetakis, who will act as caretaker prime minister until a new government is 
sworn in, said he expects elections Nov. 5. The unprecedented coalition of 
conservatives and Communists was formed in July with the sole aim of lifting 
immunity from prosecution for former Socialist ministers suspected of 
wrongdoing in a series of scandals and sending them to trial on corruption 
charges.

Carlos Pizarro, leader of Colombia's leftist M-19 guerrillas and once its 
most-wanted criminal, is to be the group's presidential candidate in next 
year's elections. Pizarro, 38, was nominated to represent the group in the May 
presidential vote, M-19 said in a statement from its mountain headquarters of 
Santo Domingo, an Andean village in southwestern Colombia. M-19 has agreed to 
lay down its arms and form a political party, two of the steps suggested in a 
peace accord signed with the government. The group has operated underground 
following its failed takeover of Bogota's Palace of Justice in November, 1985, 
in which 95 people, including 11 Supreme Court justices, were killed.

Despite protests from anti-nuclear activists, two nuclear generators were 
hauled under tight security to the shuttle Atlantis' launch pad at the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida, for installation aboard the $1.4-billion Galileo 
Jupiter probe scheduled for blastoff Thursday. Galileo is powered by a pair of 
radioisotope thermoelectric generators -- RTGs -- that convert the heat 
produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium 238 dioxide into about 570 watts 
of electricity. The devices have no moving parts and they are built to survive 
launch accidents intact. Earlier in the day in the nearby town of Cape 
Canaveral, a handful of anti-nuclear activists carrying signs and wearing gas 
masks stood on street corners in silent protest. The presence of nuclear 
generators aboard a space shuttle has generated controversy from groups who 
fear a plutonium release in the event of a launch disaster.

The Food and Drug Administration wants a New York pharmaceutical manufacturer 
to recall an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections because it 
believes the company cheated on product safety tests, an FDA official said. An 
FDA probe found indications that Bolar Pharmaceutical substituted the brand 
name product Macrodantin for its generic version of the drug nitrofurantoin in 
tests to win product approval, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit. "Because of the 
evidence indicating a substitution, it is not possible for the FDA to assure 
whether the Bolar product is therapeutically equivalent to the brand name 
product at this time," Nesbit said. The Washington Post quoted Bolar President 
Robert Shulman as saying the company would decide by early this week whether to 
recall the product. Shulman said there is "no difference" between the drug that 
was tested and Bolar's version now on the market.

Iraq informed Britain that it has detained a British nurse in connection with 
the activities of a British-based journalist arrested last month, the Foreign 
Office said in London. An Iraqi spokesman said Daphne Parish, 45, was arrested 
Sept. 19 while working in a private hospital in Baghdad. Iraqi authorities, who 
have so far refused to grant British consular officials access to Parish, told 
the Foreign Office that her detention is linked to the arrest Sept. 15 of 
Farzat Bazoft. The Observer newspaper said last month that Bazoft covered 
elections in Kurdistan and then went to the Al Iskandria area south of Baghdad 
to investigate reports of a huge explosion.

Thailand will not repatriate two Burmese students who hijacked a plane with 83 
aboard to dramatize their demand for a return to democracy in their homeland, a 
Thai official said. Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai Sirisamphan, who persuaded 
the hijackers to surrender at the U Taphao air base, said, "We will not hurt 
them." Ye Tin, 21, and Ye Thi Ha, 25 -- authorities said their names may be 
pseudonyms -- hijacked a Fokker-28 over Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and 
diverted it to Thailand, where nine hours of negotiations ended in their 
surrender.

SPIRITS FALL WITH THE WATER LEVEL AT LAKE MORENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frankie Read stood on the sandy bottom of Lake Morena last week and surveyed 
the view. All around her, where millions of gallons of water used to be, 
once-hidden rocks stood tall and dusty in the sun. On the far bank, the effect 
of recent draining was plain. About 30 feet below what was once the reservoir's 
edge a new, muddy shoreline has emerged. Nearby, the village boat ramp no 
longer reaches the water. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see, we're walking underwater," Mrs. Read, an organic gardener and 
eight-year resident of Lake Morena Village, said as she kicked silt from her 
boots. Like many of her neighbors in the southeast San Diego County hamlet, she 
usually describes the lake in terms of what used to be. 
</P>
<P>
Before the city of San Diego transferred nearly 2.8 billion gallons from Lake 
Morena into a neighboring reservoir, Barrett Lake, the water was blue. Now, 
it's turquoise, so laden with algae in some areas that visitors smell the odor 
before they reach the shore. Before March, when the three months of draining 
began, parents didn't worry about letting their children swim in the 
1,100-acre, 144-foot lake. Now, parents caution their children not to get stuck 
in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lake Morena is 440 acres and 114 feet deep, and John Lyons-Lake Morena 
Regional Park, once a magnet for fishermen, campers and rare birds alike, is 
drawing fewer visitors. At the Express Quick Mart at the center of town, bait 
and tackle sales have slowed to a trickle. And it's been months since anyone 
has seen the pair of endangered American bald eagles that used to nest on a 
granite bluff overlooking the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"When (the city) took the lake, everyone just thought this area was deadville," 
said Dorothy Tobin, who runs a horse farm near the park's entrance, about 8 
miles from the Mexican border. "The herons are gone, and most of the hawks. And 
the economy has dried up." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the draining, which ended in June, San Diego officials said the 
transfer of water was necessary to reduce Lake Morena's high evaporation rate. 
The lake, part of a three-reservoir system designed to serve San Diego in case 
of emergency, supplies water downstream to Lake Barrett and Otay Reservoir, 
where a filtration plant is situated. Draining the lake, officials said, was 
essential to the greater good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Recreation for San Diegans 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople point out, however, that the shrinking of Lake Morena is more than 
a small-town tragedy. According to county figures, of the 300,000 people who 
camped, boated and fished around the lake last year, 80% were from the city of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has really hurt San Diegans themselves, and the people don't even 
know it," said Richard Leach, the president of the Lake Morena-Campo Chamber of 
Commerce. "It's not just our lake, it's their lake, too." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists worry that the fate of Lake Morena, once one of the 
region's principal stopovers for migratory birds, may establish a dangerous 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"Reservoirs are one of the few things man constructs that have the capability 
to improve the environment," said Bobbie Moran, the Sierra Club's wildlife 
chairman. "The question is, if you create a habitat that attracts endangered 
species, do you have the right to destroy it? In the creation of environmental 
policy, the draining of reservoirs has fallen between the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club maintains that, because reservoirs enhance the environment, 
their drainage should be regulated under the California Environmental Quality 
Act, which requires that state and local agencies complete environmental impact 
studies for projects that may alter the project area. 
</P>
<P>
That view has been seconded by state attorneys who, at the request of 
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista), analyzed whether the environmental act 
pertains to city water management. Their 1988 finding: the state would have 
ample grounds to challenge San Diego's disruption of Lake Morena. As yet, 
however, the state has not undertaken such a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
County officials call the city's drainage policy indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has no water management plan," said Dianne Jacob, chief of staff for 
county Supervisor George Bailey. "It has never made any sense to us why they're 
draining Lake Morena." 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1970 agreement with the county, however, the city of San Diego owns the 
lake's water rights and may drain it to 98.5 feet, about 15 feet lower than its 
current level. The city has maintained that, although an environmental impact 
study is required before filling a reservoir, no such study need be done to 
drain one. So far, that approach has been upheld in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Superior Court Judge William C. Pate ruled that the lake is a 
city-operated reservoir and that draining it is an administrative function that 
does not require state reviews. In March, a lawyer representing the Lake Morena 
residents appealed that decision, but the appeal was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protest Wanes 
</P>
<P>
Another appeal is pending, but Lake Morena Village residents acknowledge that 
the heyday of protest, when local boat owners formed a floating barrier to 
deter city engineers, is probably over. Now that San Diego has taken what it 
came for, there are not many occasions to sing the "Lake Morena vs. S.D. City 
Ditty" that a local housewife wrote to the tune of "Summertime Blues." 
</P>
<P>
"Ya' know the eagles are your symbol and we gotta protect them," the song goes. 
"We can't let them suffer or go to extinction. The mosquitoes and the mud will 
drown them at first. And what about the odor -- our health will be the worst." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mrs. Read said that, as the lake became shallower and its waters 
warmer, mosquitoes have flourished. As the water table has dropped, several 
local residents have had to redrill their wells, and the local water company 
has issued a moratorium on new water meters, which virtually stopped all new 
construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Lake Morena Village, which is part of Campo, are noticing the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mary and Walter Saunders, a computer operator and retired building 
contractor from La Mesa, returned to Lake Morena because they remembered their 
first trip, last year, so fondly. The Saunders' van was well-equipped with 
fishing gear, but they said that, given the condition of the lake, they 
wouldn't be trying to lure the lake's famous bass, crappie, bluegill and 
catfish onto their lines this trip. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get a boat on it, and, if you can't bring your boat, it takes the 
joy out of fishing -- you can't get where you want to go," Walter Saunders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Board Sailors Complain 
</P>
<P>
Gary Elster, the president of the San Diego Boardsailing Assn., said the same 
was true for his sport. Before the draining, he said, Lake Morena's constant 
winds made it the best board-sailing site in the county. But now, he said, the 
low water level has exposed new obstacles, making it treacherous to navigate. 
Because dozens of feet of sediment have settled on the lake bottom, he said, 
the lake is even shallower than the numbers indicate. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not been able to get myself to go back," he said. "It's dangerous, and 
it's ugly to look at." 
</P>
<P>
Leach, a local realtor, said he has lost business because clients are 
frightened to buy near the receding shoreline. His goal now, he said, is to 
keep the lake from disappearing entirely -- for, while the draining flumes have 
been shut, about 300,000 gallons a day continue to seep out of the reservoir 
under the dam, county park officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels kind of funny when you're selling lake-front property and, all of a 
sudden, it's nowhere near the lake," Leach said. "They've gotten the lake down 
to a point now that, unless we get a lot of rain, we're going to lose it 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents, determined to salvage what's left of their main tourist 
attraction are hoping for heavy rains to replenish the reservoir. They are 
encouraged by memories of the late 1970s, when the lake was even lower than 
today -- a "puddle." After a few rainy years, it was full again. And local lore 
says that back in 1916, when the reservoir was 4 years old, the city hired a 
rainmaker who brought so much rain that rivers overran their banks, dams 
overflowed, cattle drowned and Lake Morena was filled to the brim. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if history were to repeat itself, some village residents say, they 
would not be satisfied. They fear that, if the reservoir regains its 
magnificence, the city might come back for more. 
</P>
<P>
All along, locals have exchanged theories about "hidden agendas" behind San 
Diego's drainage policy -- all of them denied by city officials. Some suspect a 
city-county feud sparked by the county's failure to pay the city $300,000 for 
evaporation losses. Others say they believe the city is transferring water to 
fill Lower Otay Reservoir, where an Olympic training center is planned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto a Setback 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lake Morena Village residents suffered a setback when Gov. George 
Deukmejian vetoed a bill that might have helped protect the lake from further 
draining. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), would 
have made water authorities consider the aesthetic and recreational value of a 
reservoir before disturbing it, except in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Without new state legislation on their side, environmentalists continue to push 
for enforcement of old statutes, like California Environmental Quality Act, 
that they believe already apply. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this the law? Is this what can happen anywhere? Until we know for sure, 
we're going to be asking questions," said the Sierra Club's Moran. 
</P>
<P>
People who live near Lake Morena, meanwhile, are still adjusting. The town of 
Campo has a new art gallery and its campgrounds, closed for the summer for 
repairs, have recently reopened. This year's annual children's fishing derby 
was held at a private pond -- the regular site, Lake Morena's jetty, is no 
longer near water. So far, however, no one has renamed the rounded hill at the 
northwest edge of the lake. Surrounded by dry land on all sides, it is still 
Goat Island.

POLICE PUBLISH GUIDE TO FIGHT HATE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE McGARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increase in hate crimes, dramatized by burning crosses and ethnic slurs 
scribbled across churches and synagogues, has prompted the San Diego Police 
Department to publish a pamphlet designed to combat the crimes and record their 
frequency. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet, the first of its kind, is also a result of modified state codes 
more clearly defining hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Police documented 126 hate crimes in San Diego and 147 countywide since 
November, according to John Graham, a Police Department crime prevention 
specialist and co-author of the hate crime pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
The four-page pamphlet, released this week and available at any of the city's 
10 community relations offices, tells how to identify and report a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
A hate crime, as defined by the California attorney general's office, "is any 
act or attempted act to cause physical injury, emotional suffering or property 
damage, which is or appears to be motivated, all or in part, by race, 
ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation." 
</P>
<P>
When reporting a hate crime, the pamphlet says, try to report the crime from 
the scene and get a detailed description of the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Documentation of hate crimes began shortly after the California Penal Code was 
revised early last year to include guidelines on crimes committed on the basis 
of race, ethnicity, religious and sexual orientation of the victim, Graham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the code was updated, Graham said police documented hate crimes under a 
different category, typically vandalism or battery. With a more clear 
definition of hate crimes now on the books, law enforcement agencies expect to 
keep better tabs on their degree and frequency, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, those convicted of hate crimes may face extra charges, said 
Graham, who constructed a scenario to illustrate his point: 
</P>
<P>
"Say one person is swinging a baseball bat and verbally abusing another person 
because of race, ethnicity or sexual orientation -- that used to be (only) 
battery. Now it is a hate crime and can amount to additional charges," Graham 
said. A hate crime carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $5,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Graham cautioned, however, that verbal affronts alone do not constitute a hate 
crime unless they are backed up with the threat of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully with educating the public on what hate crimes are and how to report 
them, we can improve on the percentage of people caught," Graham said, adding 
that most hate-related crimes go unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 147 hate crimes documented since November, only 12 have led to arrests, 
he said.

TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS AND MEASURE A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, at long last we finally know what the Citizens for Sensible Traffic 
Solutions thinks was the alternative, the "better way," to Measure A (last 
year's growth initiative): more taxes. Gee, I never would have guessed. 
</P>
<P>
Let me see if I have this straight: The courts threw out Measure A because they 
concluded that you cannot require developers to pay for traffic improvements 
when they didn't create the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Now they want me to pay for traffic improvements when I've paid gas tax for 20 
years; I'll have to pay to drive on the new toll corridors; and in purchasing a 
new home, I, not the builder, am paying for every single improvement to the 
roadway system through higher home prices. If I build a new home, I will have 
to pay numerous fees for road-building improvement, and they intend to attempt 
to raise the gas tax next year. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't cause the problem, but I'm asked to pay. Wow, what an unexpected and 
farsighted solution! 
</P>
<P>
Boy, it's a good thing the people who opposed Measure A took the burden off the 
responsible parties and put it back on the taxpayer. They admitted they lied to 
the public before, but I'm sure I can trust them now because 
"environmentalists" support it. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, I'll play the sap: I'll fill out their phony Orange County Poll, then 
I'll run right down and vote to pay more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Golly, I wouldn't want the wealthy responsible parties to pay!

COMMUTER TRAIN SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the air quality in Southern California is to improve it will require that a 
mass transit system be developed and successfully operated. Other than a few 
buses and even fewer trains, mass transit in Southern California is 
non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
Since I moved to Southern California over 20 years ago, I have continually 
heard politicians state that mass transit will not work in Southern California 
because of the residents' love of the individual automobile. 
</P>
<P>
One only needs to be at the San Juan Capistrano train station at 6:30 a.m. any 
weekday morning to see this is absolutely false. Literally hundreds of 
commuters board the train for Fullerton or Los Angeles. Perhaps the real reason 
politicians have avoided the development of mass transit in Southern California 
is the financial incentives afforded them by oil companies and automobile 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
I find it interesting that six additional lanes can be added to the San Diego 
Freeway, increasing air pollution, but insufficient funds are available for 
additional trains for commuters. Commuters pay to ride the train, thereby 
reducing any subsidies. I further understand that the San Diegan run from San 
Diego to Los Angeles is running at a profit for Caltrans, which should be an 
indication of individual support for more commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
I have been commuting every day on the San Diegan from San Juan Capistrano to 
Los Angeles since June of this year. I have enjoyed not driving in the severe 
traffic congestion on the freeways. However, I have observed that the system 
could be improved with some effort from Caltrans and Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, the train arrives late into Los Angeles due to the Santa Fe 
freight trains having priority over commuter service. It is imperative that the 
train operate on a strict schedule. 
</P>
<P>
To entice more commuters to ride the train and get off the freeways, there need 
to be some improvements in service. I feel these improvements are not costly 
and significantly less than additional freeway lanes. It is apparent that 
additional commuter trains could be cost-effective. I do understand that the 
funds for additional freeway lanes may be restricted for that purpose, but I 
also realize that with a little bit of negotiating by the appropriate 
administrators or elected officials, these "restrictions" could have been 
modified to include other transportation enhancements. 
</P>
<P>
I recommend: improved advertising of the commuter trains, a monthly pass for 
commuters, improved exit procedures at Union Station, giving commuter trains a 
higher priority than commercial trains to improve "on-time" performance and 
improving tracks, trains, signals and whatever else is needed to speed up train 
runs. It should be possible to have runs from San Juan to Los Angeles take less 
than one hour.

MARLIN TOURNAMENT'S EFFECT ON SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We recently returned from a very successful weekend of marlin fishing with our 
two youngest daughters. During the weekend we caught and released two marlin. 
Our girls were not only able to witness -- but also to participate firsthand -- 
in the thrills, fire drills and satisfaction of catching the greatest fish of 
the sea and then being able to release him -- free to live. It was one of the 
most satisfying times of our lives, only to be ruined by the Catalina Gold Cup 
Marlin Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup does not promote conservation; instead, it encourages participants 
to rape the sea. This is a big-money tournament, with almost $40,000 going to 
the heaviest fish brought to the scales -- that is what is disgusting. They 
killed more than 80 fish. Thank God it is only a two-day tournament. 
</P>
<P>
We understand several fish are donated to charities for food, and they have 
people eager to receive the fresh fish, but let's be realistic -- 80 marlin! 
</P>
<P>
What can we do to get people like this to understand that if they continue to 
rape the seas, there will not be any fish for their children to catch -- and, 
we hope, release? We would like to protest this tournament and end it. If the 
city of Avalon feels it must continue with the Gold Cup, it should be 
restructured as a tag-and-release tournament, similar to the L.A. Billfish 
Tournament. The 1989 L.A. Billfish Tournament caught and released about 50 
marlin. 
</P>
<P>
We are not a couple of Greenpeace fanatics, but we do respect our seas and the 
life they hold. We are avid sportfishermen, fishing every weekend during marlin 
season and several weekends in the spring and fall for other species -- which 
we also release. But we feel that this type of unnecessary slaughter must be 
stopped.

SOUTH COUNTY CLOSURE OF WELFARE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on welfare (For Poor, Closure of South County Welfare Office 
Spells Hardship, Sept. 29) enrages me and my colleagues! We are the 
hard-working stiffs caught in the crunch, losing money, working long hours and 
watching our standard of living decrease. We feel that the welfare population 
of Orange County should move to San Bernardino. We bust our butts to live here, 
and we do not need to hear that the non-working segment of Orange County is 
upset because they have troubles getting their free handouts. If these people 
are going to be so irresponsible as to have children and not be able to support 
them, why should we have to hear of it, and (hear of) material that makes it 
sound like the end of the world? 
</P>
<P>
We would all love to have free money and not have the stress, work long hours 
and plan children because of economics. In my family, we would love to have 
more kids, but I cannot afford it. I drive 100 miles a day to work because I 
cannot afford to live in our county right now. I live in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
We need more articles about the people, such as apartment owners, affected by 
the drug issue, or the high rate of drug use in our welfare system, or the 
effect of the tax laws on the disappearing middle-class, or the sacrifices that 
regular working people make every day just to survive -- and (fewer) articles 
on the blight of the poor. We are all going to be poor if any more gets dumped 
on the workers who are paying for all these social services.

APPROACHING THE HOMELESS PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to express outrage at the county's recent decision to place rocks 
beneath several street overpasses to prevent the homeless from using them for 
shelter. I am reminded of a time when a city on the East Coast covered heating 
grates to prevent the homeless from gathering over them during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
The "solution" of giving the displaced individuals 25 cents for a phone call 
and a list of resources is particularly disturbing. Anyone who has worked on 
any resource hot line in the country knows that it takes numerous phone calls 
to locate a shelter, if any, with an available bed. It was a poor gesture on 
the part of the county to offer such a thinly disguised empty hand. 
</P>
<P>
It again becomes painfully evident that this problem must be addressed at a 
national level.

IRVINE RIGHTS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the only gay person on the 13-member Advisory Board of Irvine Citizens 
United, I would like to respond to some of the charges made against gays and 
lesbians by the religious extremists who wish to exclude us from the Irvine 
Human Rights ordinance. They have attacked the morals, motives and integrity of 
the gay and lesbian community and have attacked me personally. The latest smear 
pamphlet distributed by the Irvine Values Coalition on Sept. 30 is a prime 
example of their fear-mongering tactics. 
</P>
<P>
They have tried to tell Irvine residents what we think, how we feel and what we 
want. They have tried to tell us that we are sick, dysfunctional and in need of 
"reparative therapy." In effect, what they are saying is that because we don't 
think as they think, don't act as they act, don't believe as they believe, we 
don't deserve to be treated as human beings with the same rights as everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
They can believe anything they choose to believe. But they have no right to sit 
in judgment of me or anyone else. In the United States of America, I too have 
the right to my beliefs, my aspirations and my privacy. All that I and my gay 
friends want is the right to be able to put food on our tables, roofs over our 
heads and a little dignity in our lives. Despite the smear campaign, and all 
the untruths and half-truths that the Irvine Values Coalition is spreading, I'm 
heartened at the overwhelming support the Human Rights ordinance has received 
from the vast majority of Irvine citizens. I feel confident they will vote "no" 
on Measure N.

FOSTER-CARE NEEDS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have all read of the critical need for foster-care homes in Orange County. 
Children languish in Orangewood for lack of available foster families to place 
them with, we are told. My husband and I are licensed foster parents in Orange 
County and had a 4-year-old girl living with us in 1987 and '88. After she left 
to live with her grandparents, we took a short break. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, we called county children's services to say we were ready for 
another placement. We waited and waited but no one contacted us. Over the next 
few months, we called again to check on the delay and were told that the social 
workers would be in touch. Last month, eight months after our first call, we 
gave up and decided to relinquish our license. As I explained our decision to 
an official in the licensing department, she was incredulous that this could 
happen. So were we. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I have no ill will regarding this situation. My only purpose in 
writing this letter is to alert those in Orange County Children's Services who 
are involved in formulating procedures for placement of foster children that 
there is a problem. I have no doubt of the real need for foster care, and I 
hate to think that there may be other foster homes not being utilized. Perhaps 
this letter will spark an interest in finding out what went wrong here, so it 
doesn't happen again.

ANAHEIM SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is the best authority on the way things are in the Anaheim Union High 
School District? 
</P>
<P>
Should we believe a beleaguered teacher who is in the classroom every day 
facing more and more students and getting less and less (real income) 
compensation? Edwina Walsh (Letters, Sept. 24) complains that the 
superintendent and school board are snubbing parents and teachers with their 
policies and use of district funds. 
</P>
<P>
Or should we believe one of the district's high-paid bureaucrats who seldom, if 
ever, sees any students but gets paid more than teachers for shuffling papers 
in his private, air-conditioned district office (just down the hall from the 
superintendent's suite)? Jim Cox (Letters, Oct. 1) implies that things are OK 
in the district as he twists a 44% parent satisfaction rating to a 73% 
satisfaction level with his handy calculator. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that this district has been dealing with "budget problems" in 
recent years by axing teaching positions. No administrative positions have been 
cut. The superintendent has been offering measly salary increases (e.g. 1%) to 
district employees while persuading the school board to raise her salary to 
over $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, 84% of the teachers in this district participated in a one-day 
strike. They did it to send a message to the superintendent and school board to 
give a higher priority to teachers and classrooms. The response so far has been 
to get even rather than to get the message.

DAYTIME CAR LIGHTS

Car lights for a daytime drive? You bet! Just visit Scandinavia and see for 
yourself, as this recent tourist can confirm. In Finland and Sweden, it's the 
law to drive with lights on both day and night. In fact, new cars contain a 
device that automatically turns on the lights when the engine starts up.

BID TO HELP POOR MOTHERS MARKS BIRTH OF GOOD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Gynecologic Society has found a relatively simple, yet creative, 
tactic to divide and conquer at least part of a major health problem here. The 
society is asking its members to treat at least one pregnant woman a month who 
has no other means of obtaining care. By dividing up the task, the society's 
167 members could treat about half of the approximately 300 women who deliver 
babies each month in San Diego County with no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
And, if all of the county's 230 gynecologists saw a woman a month, three 
quarters of the women needing care would be able to get it. 
</P>
<P>
That's too optimistic, of course. Some physicians are already taking nonpaying 
patients, and others will not participate. And some women, particularly those 
addicted to drugs, will not avail themselves of the service. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the society decided that it had to take some action. San Diego has 
the state's highest rate of no-care deliveries, and doctors end up delivering 
the babies in hospital emergency rooms under high-risk conditions. So the 
volunteer program will help doctors as well as mothers and babies. What's more, 
it will save money. Studies have found that, on average, every dollar spent in 
prenatal care saves $3 to $4 in later care. 
</P>
<P>
The Gynecologic Society is to be congratulated for its innovative program, 
which initially will be organized through a grant from the Irvine Foundation. 
And it's a program worthy of imitation. The possibilities are intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, what if physicians in other specialties were to adopt similar 
plans? The American Medical Assn. recently recommended that doctors donate 50 
hours a year in care to the poor. In San Diego County, that would amount to 
about 225,000 hours of free care. 
</P>
<P>
If psychologists did likewise, it could take some of the sting out of the 
cutbacks in mental health funds. 
</P>
<P>
What about dentists? Or lawyers? The American Bar Assn. last year passed a 
resolution saying that attorneys should donate 50 hours a year in professional 
services. 
</P>
<P>
All of these professions have members who volunteer selflessly, and some are 
putting more of an emphasis on volunteerism. For instance, the San Diego 
Volunteer Lawyer Program, sponsored by the San Diego County Bar Assn., says 
that the number of attorneys with major law firms who are participating has 
risen from 10% to about 20% in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
But much more is needed. Using Bar Assn. estimates, for instance, the Volunteer 
Lawyer Program calculates that 65,000 to 75,000 San Diegans whose incomes are 
at or below the federal poverty line need legal services each year, and that 
only 20%-25% of that need is being met by existing legal-aid services. 
</P>
<P>
And the county says there are thousands of San Diegans who do without medical 
and mental-health care because they can't afford medical insurance, don't 
qualify for Medi-Cal and are not sick enough for county programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, volunteer programs are not a substitute for insurance or more 
government aid. But they can help close the gaping holes in society's safety 
nets.

UCSD'S BUSINESS ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is written in response to Michael Schrage's column "Entrepreneurial 
Gap at Local Universities," which ran Sept. 14 (Business). In his article, Mr. 
Schrage asserted that Southern California universities have had little impact 
on the new high-technology industries in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The story in San Diego is quite different. Because of its research focus and 
its development in the land-rich northern corner of the city, UC San Diego has 
been instrumental in the continued growth of San Diego's electronics and 
computer industry and a central player in the growth of San Diego as a center 
for biotechnology. In a survey which we conducted last year, San Diego boasted 
70 biotech companies, many of them started by UCSD graduates or faculty. In 
addition, the number of electronics, neural network, software and medical 
instruments companies is increasing. UCSD has maintained close ties to these 
companies through industrial liaison programs and technical education offered 
through University Extension. 
</P>
<P>
To further stimulate the development of high-technology in San Diego, UCSD 
Extension four years ago started CONNECT, an innovative program which links 
high-tech entrepreneurs with the financial, managerial and technical resources 
and skills they need for success. CONNECT offers seminars, lectures and courses 
on topics such as raising capital, marketing technology products and 
intellectual property protection. On an individual basis, CONNECT counsels 
high-tech entrepreneurs on how to write their business plans and introduces 
them to investors. 
</P>
<P>
This year, UCSD is seeking to further enhance technology transfer through an 
office dedicated to this activity exclusively.

KEEPING WATERFRONT VISION CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much progress has been made recently in developing a promising plan for San 
Diego's downtown waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc group, representing 13 organizations, has produced a conceptual plan 
that, if adhered to, should preserve views of San Diego Bay and protect several 
parcels of open space along the water, including a 10-acre park at the foot of 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is a testament to what can be produced through cooperation and 
coordination. Five government entities have jurisdiction over the land from 
Laurel Street to just south of the new Convention Center and inland to Harbor 
Drive: the city, the county, the Centre City Development Corp., the San Diego 
Unified Port District and the Navy. The agencies were able to subordinate some 
of their individual interests to the greater goal of an inviting waterfront. As 
with all conceptual plans, however, the proof will be in the execution. The 
design principles still have to be incorporated into the city's master plan for 
downtown, and the Navy and the Port District, both of which have considerable 
autonomy on development matters, will have to apply the principles to their 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The first test of the cooperative spirit will come in a few weeks when the Port 
District considers a "memorandum of understanding" passed by the City Council, 
which covers several points of the conceptual plan. 
</P>
<P>
At least one port commissioner has questioned some of the building restrictions 
affecting port properties and voiced concern that the city is trying to preempt 
the port's authority. 
</P>
<P>
We hope the commission is able to move beyond such concerns. Turf wars will 
serve no one's interests and could jeopardize a vision for the waterfront that 
would serve everyone's interests and the interests of future generations.

ETHICS REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Common Cause wishes to extend its sincere thanks and appreciation to state 
Assembly members Lucy Killea and Robert Frazee who, together with five of their 
colleagues, played a leadership role in the drafting of a comprehensive package 
of ethics-reform proposals designed to restore public confidence in state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
As members of the bipartisan Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, Killea and 
Frazee had to make unpopular decisions affecting the activities of other 
legislators. Through an extraordinarily open and deliberative process, the 
committee recommended to the full Assembly an exhaustive, thoughtful list of 
reforms: Eliminate honoraria, strictly limit gifts, prohibit the personal use 
of campaign funds -- and much more. Common Cause gives the committee report a 
grade of B for substance. However, the committee's effort deserves nothing less 
than an A+. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the committee's recommendations were not fully implemented in 
either house of the Legislature. This should not lessen our praise for each 
committee member who, faced with tough decisions, made tough choices. Killea 
and Frazee, along with other committee appointees, have served their 
constituents and the state of California well. They have provided for some 
restoration of confidence in the institution they serve and have opened the 
door to a more responsive and effective state Legislature.

RECOUPLING: A CHANCE TO ANSWER 'I DO AGAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AURORA MACKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a publicist's dream, a Hollywood romance with more drama and glamour 
than anyone could have asked for. 
</P>
<P>
He, Miami's main man, and she, the silver screen's newest darling, about to tie 
the knot -- and for the second time, no less. After a brief marriage in 1976, 
now Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith were back together again, with a baby on 
the way. Not since the remarriage of Liz and Dick or R.J. and Natalie had the 
public awareness of star-crossed lovers been so high. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the ensuing magazine articles mused, wasn't their reunion after so 
many years apart a clear sign of fate, proof of the existence of Great Romance, 
indisputable evidence of True Love? 
</P>
<P>
If the answer is yes, then true love, it seems, is in far greater supply these 
days than most people believe. Mental-health professionals say they now 
regularly encounter couples who have divorced, gone their separate ways and 
then want to reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
"They separate because the marriage wasn't working," said Carlfred Broderick, 
director of the marriage and family therapy training program at USC. "Then they 
remarry when they discover that the divorce wasn't working."

Dr. Mark Goulston, a West Los Angeles psychiatrist who, during the last five 
years, has helped 12 couples walk down the aisle together a second time, 
believes the trend he calls "recoupling" is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think about getting back together with their exes. But now, 
more and more people are actually doing it," Goulston said. "So often, couples 
divorce because of the 'grass-is-greener' syndrome: They think they'll find 
someone more exciting, more intelligent, more whatever. Then they get out there 
and discover they were wrong, and that all the things they heard about the 
dating jungle are true." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The External Factors 
</P>
<P>
Although what prompts a person to reconsider an ex-spouse varies, Goulston said 
it often is an external factor -- the engagement of a former spouse, a personal 
crisis such as the death of a parent, or a failed relationship that had 
appeared promising. 
</P>
<P>
"Their kids start having a hard time, the realities of forming a step-family 
sets in, or something happens to make them realize how alone they are. And all 
of a sudden," he said, "the old home and hearth start to look pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the recoupling phenomenon, Broderick says, may be due in large part to 
the sheer number of divorces across the country. Of the 2 million marriages 
each year, he said, half now end in divorce. Of those, he added, "tens of 
thousands of couples end up remarrying each other every year. So the number may 
have increased in recent years, even though the percentage rate of 5 to 10% 
hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
But couples who have gotten back together believe that a lot more has been at 
work in their lives than just statistical odds. Some call it fate, while others 
cite such things as remorse, humility or acceptance -- three emotions not 
normally found in the Divorced Couples Handbook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pain of Loss 
</P>
<P>
Take Kathy Clark and Max Dragovich, for example, who married in 1982. During 
the next three years, Kathy said, the couple experienced several major losses, 
including the death of Kathy's mother and Max's father. Both stopped 
communicating and withdrew. Despite Kathy's belief they could work out their 
problems, Max filed for divorce in 1986 and began seeing other women. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrecked," Kathy, a business development manager, said flatly of the 
emotional aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, she moved to Corona Del Mar from La Crescenta, went back to 
school and eventually put the failed marriage behind her, until Max called a 
year later. "He didn't say he was sorry or acknowledge anything that had 
happened," she said. "He just called to invite me to dinner. But I was happy to 
hear his voice so I said yes." 
</P>
<P>
Max maintains that he had no intention of getting back together with Kathy. He 
was aware she was dating other men but said he wasn't bothered by it. When he 
called her, it was because "I was concerned as a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy thinks there was slightly more to it than that. "He was dating other 
women, but I know he never took them around his family or our friends," she 
said. "Knowing Max the way I do, I think it was his ego that he couldn't admit 
he had make a mistake (to file for divorce)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detached Position 
</P>
<P>
When they did begin dating again, Kathy, gun-shy and more than a little bit 
suspicious of his intentions, maintained an emotional posture of detached 
curiosity. Although she began seeing him more often, she said she occasionally 
acted "testy and sometimes bitchy" with him. She also continued to date other 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she didn't trust me," said Max. 
</P>
<P>
Trust, though, took time. Even today, with their second marriage only a month 
away, Kathy said she still experiences the occasional thought, "If he left me 
once, what's to stop him from doing it again?" But from the experience, she 
said, she also gained a greater acceptance of who Max really is, instead of who 
she wanted him to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept now he doesn't talk much about his feelings, whereas before I always 
thought it meant he didn't love me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amicable Parting 
</P>
<P>
Cindy and Foster Taylor of Houston also learned a few things the second time 
around. First married in 1980, they divorced in 1983 with a 1-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the nightclub business, and I always came home late. She thought that 
environment was kind of fun when we were dating, but not when we were trying to 
raise a family," recalled Foster, now 44. "I didn't want to change my life 
style, and so when she threatened to leave, I just said, 'Fine.' We ended up 
holding hands while the lawyer drew up the papers." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their child, the couple saw each other frequently. But it wasn't 
until the following New Year's Eve, when they dated each other again for the 
first time since the divorce, that both realized they had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say that I had a religious experience, but I had a sudden 
reevaluation of my life," Foster said. "I realized it wasn't nearly so much her 
fault as I had thought, and that I would rather admit I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Element of Time 
</P>
<P>
Time can also play a role. "Often, the chance of success depends on how much 
time has elapsed," said Constance Ahrons, a professor of sociology at USC who 
has counseled several divorced couples and is the author of "Divorced 
Families," a recently published book that examines what happens to family 
members after the breakup. "Couples need enough distance to be able to look at 
the reasons for the divorce, see how they have changed, and recognize how they 
really feel about each other now." 
</P>
<P>
Robert and Penelope Lohr of Columbus, Ohio, didn't see or hear from each for 14 
years after their divorce. He remarried and moved to England. Penelope 
remarried, divorced again and then moved to New York City for 10 years. Then 
one day "out of the blue," Robert telephoned her Manhattan apartment and told 
her he was divorced too. "When I went to pick him up at the airport, we just 
hugged each other and sobbed," she recalled. "We both knew." They were 
remarried in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But merely possessing a desire to reconcile doesn't necessarily guarantee that 
couples will end up hearing themselves say, "I do again." Goulston, who 
estimated that the success rate among divorced couples is about 25%, has seen 
eight couples try to retie the knot and get tangled in the process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Revisited 
</P>
<P>
One 41 year-old woman, who asked not to be identified, divorced her husband 
when he refused to seek help with his alcoholism. After they had been apart for 
nearly a year, the man entered a chemical-dependency program and the couple 
began dating shortly thereafter. Although the woman began to fall in love 
again, all hopes of reconciliation were lost when he began drinking a few 
months later. "I had been through hell with him once," she said, "I knew too 
much by then to go back to it." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the high failure rate among ex-spouses seeking reconciliation, 
some therapists say, is that not all couples are motivated by pure love. In 
some cases, finances may be a driving force, while children may be a 
consideration for other couples. Other times, couples may be involved in a 
"breakup-makeup" pattern of behavior that is based on an inability to let go 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcome the Fears 
</P>
<P>
Often, counselors say, problems such as resentment, anger, wounded pride and a 
fear of being hurt again must be overcome for a successful reconciliation. 
Goulston said most couples must first deal with what he calls the "three R's": 
remorse, restitution and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"Remorse is a genuine request for forgiveness by the person most responsible 
for the breakup," he said. Restitution, he said, involves the willingness of 
that person to understand how the other partner was affected by the breakup. 
"You're acknowledging that you were out there having fun while the other person 
was having a silent breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
And rehabilitation, he said, is the ability to show new skills for dealing with 
conflict. "Both people have to know that things will be different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took David and Gigi Mueller several years to work through the "three R's." 
After 13 years of marriage, Gigi Mueller divorced her minister husband and left 
the three children with him. When she moved back to Wilmington, Del., to try to 
reconcile their relationship three years later, her husband David still had a 
lot of anger. "He had written me off," said Gigi. "He wasn't certain it wasn't 
going to be a bigger mistake trying to make it work again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rough Times Ahead 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that brought the couple together, she believes, is that both 
were willing to look at the way their past behavioral patterns had contributed 
to the breakup. "We don't hold things back any more." 
</P>
<P>
When they decided to remarry, she said, they melted down their original wedding 
rings and made them into a cross she now wears around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
Although children are no more likely to hold the marriage together the second 
time than they were the first, some therapist believe that kids who are having 
post-divorce difficulties are often a compelling reason for couples to give 
their relationship a second try. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening the Wounds 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the impetus, counselors warn that children who are struggling in 
the aftermath of divorce may be hurt even more if they see their parents go out 
together again or wake up to see daddy in the kitchen making breakfast -- only 
to watch their parents break up one more time. 
</P>
<P>
West Los Angeles psychiatrist Mark Goulston recommends couples conceal their 
dating from children until they are "90% certain" they will stay together. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle for couples trying to reconcile can be friends and relatives 
-- especially after they learn that the person they heard dragged through the 
mud is now coming back again. 
</P>
<P>
"I said terrible things about him," Mueller said. "The first thing my mother 
said was, 'Are you crazy?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hurt and Vindictive' 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Clark and Max Dragovich said they have experienced similar responses. 
"I'm my father's only daughter, and he's still pretty protective of me," Kathy 
said. "He still says, 'He hurt you once, he can hurt you again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Recommends Goulston: "With parents and others, what you have to tell them is, 
'I was no angel either. You heard things from me when I was hurt and 
vindictive.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although the road back to the altar isn't always easy, those who have traveled 
it say they know things now that they couldn't have learned in any other way. 
And as a result, they say their marriages are stronger than before. 
</P>
<P>
"We both had to grow in a way that couldn't have taken place if we had stayed 
together," said Abby Dalton, actress on the television show, "Falcon Crest," 
who divorced her husband of nine years in 1969. After three years, during which 
time she said they "both searched diligently for someone else," the couple 
reconciled and remarried in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried it without each other, and the conclusion we reached is that we just 
truly love each other. Now," she said, pausing for a moment, "there is no more 
doubt in our minds."

ON VIEW: FIRST THINGS FIRST: LEADING LADIES' MATINEE FOR DONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles is a fountain of youth with all kinds of new firsts on the social 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's First Chair Society entertained at its 
first Leading Ladies' Matinee on Wednesday morning. Said co-president Jennifer 
Diener: "In Salzburg, they have matinees in the morning. I thought it would be 
different." The morning Matinee, planned by Carol Henry, feted the big donors, 
and among the Ladies were Susie Barker, Peggy Parker, Rosalind Millstone, 
Barbara Reilly, Debbie Tellefsen, Judith Rosen, Kay Duke Ingalls, Dorothy Woods 
and Jane Arnault. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at a sit-down at the Hilton, Jack and Elaine Lerman, Marty and Marjorie 
Roth, Dr. Stan and Jackie Furer, and Hal and Cynthia Gershman decided to form a 
new charitable foundation -- Associates for Breast Cancer Studies. They've 
pledged 75% of all monies raised to the John Wayne Cancer Clinic. The Furers 
have donated their guest house for an office, the Gershmans provided phones and 
office equipment, the Lermans a computer, the Marty Greenbergs a 3-M Copier, 
and the Norman Ripps gave office supplies. They plan a membership affair Dec. 
21 at Jimmy's. 
</P>
<P>
And those spectacular examples of eternal youth -- Bob Hope and Dick Clark -- 
celebrate inauguration of the National Parkinson Foundation California Research 
Laboratories at USC's Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANA: Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee and the 
honoree at the Americana Associates' Americana Ball, couldn't resist. He picked 
up a guitar and sang with Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham's Sweet Baby Blues Band at 
the Regent Beverly Wilshire the other evening. 
</P>
<P>
That's the black-tie affair Lydia Webb chaired to raise funds for Project 
Americana of the Fine Arts Committee at the State Department. In the spotlight 
were former Ambassador to Australia William (Bill)Lane, Ginie and Henry Braun, 
Glen and Gloria Holden, Chuck and Diane Norris, Roy and Pauline Naftzger and 
Lydia's daughter Mary Ann Hunt (one of the Texas Hunts) and her escort, Andrew 
Reisini of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Now Lydia and her husband, Dr. Roscoe C. Webb Jr., will attend Canadian Consul 
Gen. Joan Winser's welcoming reception Wednesday at the Canadian residence for 
Canada's prime minister, the Rt. Hon. Brian Mulroney and Mrs. Mulroney, and 
then they and Mary Beth and Robert Van Dine are off to Washington, invited for 
dinner with President George and Barbara Bush on Thursday and luncheon at the 
home of Vice president Dan and Marilyn Quayle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
ENCORE: The American Horse Show Assn.'s New York tradition -- Champagne at 
Cartier -- was brought to Cartier on Rodeo Drive last year with such success 
that it was a repeat the other evening with Marion Scharffenberger and Mrs. 
Allan M. Cartter co-chairing the reception to raise funds for young rider 
programs of the National Equestrian Federation of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Joining in was honorary chair Stefanie Powers (who had just returned from the 
Polish Arabian national sales). More there to support future Olympic efforts 
were Bettina Bancroft Klink and her daughter Elisabeth Goth Clark, Montgomery 
and Jo Fisher, Robin Parsky, jockey Chris and Judy McCarron, Chris Shoemaker 
and Olympic rider Lisa Jacquin. Flying in for the party were the association 
president, James C. Wofford, and his wife, Gail, of Uppervillle, Va., and Jane 
Forbes Clark of New York. 
</P>
<P>
THE TOPS: Alison and Joseph Winter host an intimate reception for Count and 
Countess Giuseppe Panza di Biumo (foremost private collectors of post-World War 
II American Art) on Oct. 18 at their Pasadena home. . . .

Jenny Rutt and her co-chair, Mary Milner, are raving about the combined glamour 
of Bob Mackie (he just costumed for the San Francis Opera), Neiman Marcus and 
Luminaires Juniors for their extravaganza to benefit Estelle Doheny Eye Clinic 
Nov. 30 at the Beverly Hills Hotel. . . .

TINY BRITISH ISLANDS BOOM AS TAX-FREE UTOPIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. PETER PORT, Guernsey, Channel Islands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, this is no Utopia. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, that there was a five-minute traffic jam just the other 
day as tourists vied with the many residents who customarily go home for lunch. 
And a visitor personally witnessed litter in the form of a discarded hamburger 
container. 
</P>
<P>
People who leave their cars unlocked have lately reported things stolen from 
inside, and there was even a murder last year. Or maybe it was the year before. 
Chief Police Inspector Geoff Denning apologized for his uncertainty. "You know 
how time flies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All those clearly exaggerated reports about what an idyllic place this is stem 
from a Gallup Poll, published late last year, indicating that the world's 
happiest people live on Guernsey. 
</P>
<P>
About 43% of responding residents declared themselves "very happy," and another 
54% said they were "quite happy" -- results topping any that Gallup had 
previously recorded elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Few questioned the results, presumably because they seemed consistent with the 
island's reputation for great wealth, low taxes, comparatively balmy weather 
and leisurely pace of life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surface Satisfaction 
</P>
<P>
A reporter probed deeper, however, and after two, sun-drenched fact-finding 
trips found beneath all this surface satisfaction some serious reservations 
about Gallup's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Residents on the neighboring island of Jersey were not polled, for example. If 
they had been, insisted Brian West, a banker in Jersey's principal town, St. 
Helier, the results would have proved that Guernseymen are only "the second 
happiest people in the world. Because undoubtedly the happiest are on Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Another Jersey resident, asked why he thought the 60,000 inhabitants of 
Guernsey are so happy, replied: "They're thick as two planks, that's why!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life's Downside 
</P>
<P>
While longstanding interisland rivalry might be a factor in such comments, even 
Guernsey residents concede that there is a downside to life on the island. 
Things have gotten so good, they say, that it's almost bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago we lived in a civilized island," resident Jan Dyke wrote to 
the Guernsey Weekly Press the other day. "This is no longer the case. . . . 
Money dominates everything and everyone in this island today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ancient Occupation 
</P>
<P>
Humans have lived here for more than 4,000 years, but it is only in the last 20 
or 30 that the Channel Islands have attracted much international attention. 
That's when they were recognized as potential tax havens -- or, as the 
islanders prefer to call them, offshore financial-services centers. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the English Channel, just a few miles off the northwest coast of 
France, the islands are dependent territories of Britain, but with their own 
legislatures, judiciaries and administration. The two principle islands are 
Jersey, population 82,000, and Guernsey, with much smaller populations also 
inhabiting Alderney, Sark and Herm. 
</P>
<P>
The islands gave their names to two famous breeds of cattle (Jersey and 
Guernsey) and one American state (New Jersey). In England, the islanders were 
perhaps best known as "Britain's truck farmers," the source of about 80% of the 
country's tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
There is still a tomato museum here on Guernsey, but the islands' once-famous 
hothouses have mostly been in decline since after World War II. Now their 
favorable tax structure and popularity as vacation resorts are much more 
important than their "passion fruit," as the tomatoes are known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduced Liability 
</P>
<P>
There are no sales, capital gains or inheritance taxes here, and the top 
income-tax rate, applicable only to residents, is 20%. Guernsey property taxes, 
based on 1948 evaluations, are a tiny fraction of those on the British 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The islands have thus become both an increasingly popular home for British and 
other expatriates anxious to reduce their tax liability, and a haven for 
absentee companies trying to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year there were more than 12,000 companies registered on 
Guernsey alone, double the number a decade earlier. Deposits in the island's 56 
banks totaled more than 10 billion pounds ($16 billion), about 10 times the 
level of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jersey is even a bigger finance center, with about 25 billion pounds on 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jersey has gotten just a little bit too busy," commented Paul Carre, 
20, who works for the Guernsey Tourist Board. "We're trying to prevent that 
happening here," he added, reflecting a rivalry between the islands that goes 
back at least to the 17th Century, when Jersey was Royalist and Guernsey 
"Roundhead" -- pro-Parliament -- in the English Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deliberate State 
</P>
<P>
Guernseymen like to point out that the speed limit here is 35 m.p.h. compared 
to 40 m.p.h. on Jersey. Also symbolic is the official name of the island's 
parliament, the "States of Deliberation." A popular bumper sticker, referring 
to a fictional Jersey detective in a popular British television series, 
asserts: "Bergerac Takes His Holiday in Guernsey." 
</P>
<P>
Still, relatively speaking, Guernsey is booming. And the signs of prosperity 
are everywhere. Even though the entire island covers only 24 square miles, for 
example, automobile ownership is twice as high as in mainland Britain. There's 
a 10-year wait to get into the Royal Guernsey Golf Club, and despite the recent 
opening of a new, 900-slip marina in St. Peter Port, there is still a shortage 
of berths for all the island's private boats. 
</P>
<P>
Island economist John Dickson said that average incomes here are about 10% 
higher than on the British mainland. While the cost of living is also somewhat 
higher because most consumer goods must be shipped in from outside, the 
islanders still have an edge, even before considering their more favorable tax 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand for Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Authority administrator Michael H. De La Mare said only 50 persons 
are currently unemployed on the island, less than 0.2% of the work force. Most 
of those are between jobs, he added, and the daily newspaper advertises several 
times that many openings. 
</P>
<P>
The labor situation is so tight that the island's financial institutions 
recruit youngsters for entry level jobs at age 15 and 16. Hotels and the 
horticulture industry, meanwhile, import staff from Italy, Portugal and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
To try and keep a balance between economic prosperity and the quality of island 
life, local leaders have introduced a number of controls. A two-tier housing 
market reserves 90% of available accommodation for natives, those who have 
lived here for at least 15 years, and a handful of others, such as air-traffic 
controllers and psychiatrists, whose professional services are deemed essential 
to Guernsey's welfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Market Housing 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 1,800 homes are available on an "open" market to anyone who can 
afford them. The average "open" market home now sells for nearly $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The housing control laws are meant to restrain the demand for local property 
in order to keep prices down," said Ben Lovell, a leading Guernsey real-estate 
agent and vice president of the legislature's powerful advisory and finance 
committee. And they do keep "local" property prices at about half the level of 
comparable housing on the "open" market. But still, the cost and limited 
availability of shelter, particularly for young families, is perhaps the 
island's biggest problem, said Lovell. 
</P>
<P>
New construction is limited by strict planning controls, enforced by an Island 
Development Commission. The commission reportedly approves only a small 
fraction of all applications brought before it. A new building or addition 
"mustn't block anyone's view of anything remotely pretty," said one longtime 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uneven Distribution 
</P>
<P>
Some residents claim that Guernsey's is increasingly a two-tier society of 
"haves" and "have-nots." But while there is clearly an uneven distribution of 
wealth on the island, John Guilbert, district secretary for the Transport &amp; 
General Workers Union, said that most of his 4,000 members here "are probably 
better off than their compatriots in the United Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
There's a prehistoric granite statue in front of St. Martin's Church here that 
was found nearby. Note, said Guernsey Tourist Board senior marketing manager 
Michael Paul, that even this ancient stone figure has a slight smile on her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
While the marketing man's suggestion that Guernsey residents were unusually 
happy even 4,000 years ago might get by some, however, others won't be fooled. 
Right there on the plaque it admits that the statue's facial features were only 
added in the Gallo-Roman period, a mere 2,000 years ago.

TRACKING THE UP-DOWN FORTUNES OF FUNICULARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JOHNSTOWN, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Its official name is the Johnstown Inclined Plane, but residents here call it 
the Heavenly Hoist. 
</P>
<P>
The Inclined railway's two cars whiz up and down the steep 896.5-foot, 
72%-grade Yoder Hill 65 times a day, one trip every 15 minutes. It's fast, 
smooth, quiet like an elevator going at a slant. Ninety seconds, and it's all 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Regular commuters living in the hillside residential community of Westmont ride 
the Inclined Plane to work and school every day. Others take the railway to 
Johnstown to shop, eat out, or go to a movie. 
</P>
<P>
At least 30 automobiles ($1.50 each way for the car and $1 for each passenger) 
are carried daily in the 15-foot wide, 34-foot long rail cars that transport as 
many as 50 passengers a trip. The rail cars stand straight out in the air in a 
most peculiar manner above the steep tracks as they go up and down the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1950s buses were also carried on the rail cars, but modern buses are 
too large. So, many commuters transfer from Westmont buses to the Inclined 
Plane and back again to buses at the Lower Station in Johnstown. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen quaint funiculars providing public transportation up 
and down steep slopes in various places in the United States. The Heavenly 
Hoist is one of three Incline railways operating in Pennsylvania -- the other 
two are in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
During the earlier part of the century there were more than 200 Incline 
railways from Maine to California. In Downtown Los Angeles, for example, there 
were two separate Incline railways. The 325-foot-long Angel's Flight operated 
on Bunker Hill from 1901 to 1969, and the 180-foot-long Court Flight from 1904 
to 1942. For the past 20 years, Angel's Flight has sat dismantled and gathering 
dust in storage waiting to be restored and put back into service. 
</P>
<P>
This has been one of the busiest years in recent memory for the Johnstown 
Inclined Plane. By the end of the year more than 500,000 passengers will have 
ridden the electrically powered, counterbalanced cable car system, the vast 
majority attending the centennial events commemorating the Johnstown Flood. 
</P>
<P>
On May 31, 1889, South Fork Dam suddenly gave way, sending a 70-foot avalanche 
of water through the steel mill town. The Johnstown Flood killed more than 
2,200 men, women and children and left an incredible path of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Great Flood, the Cambria Iron Co., which was one of the 
largest steel producers in America, with 7,000 Johnstown men on its payroll, 
erected a model community on 1,000 acres of farm land it owned on top of Yoder 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
It constructed the Incline railway to provide transportation from the new 
hilltop community of Westmont to its Johnstown mines and mills. The Incline 
railway began operating June 1, 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1900 and 1920, the railway ran around the clock seven days a week with 
a trip every five minutes. The fare was a penny a ride. Today the fare is $1. 
In 1919, the peak year, 1,356,293 passengers rode the Incline. When flood 
waters inundated Johnstown again in 1936 and 1977, the railway carried 
thousands of people to higher ground and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Steel companies operated the Incline railway until 1923 when it was sold to the 
borough of Westmont for $1. The municipality ran it until 1982. It was sold 
again for $1, this time to the Cambria County Transit Authority which has run 
it ever since as a vital link in Johnstown's mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnstown Inclined Plane has been in service continuously for 98 years 
except for an 18-month hiatus starting in January, 1983, when $3.5 million of 
federal, state and local funds were used to rehabilitate the roadbed, tracks, 
equipment, rail cars and stations. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh was once America's Incline railway capital. It had 17 of the quaint 
railways, more than any other city in the nation, but only two have survived, 
the Monongahela and the Duquesne (Du-cain.) 
</P>
<P>
The Monongahela Incline, the first passenger Incline railway in America, is 
still in service carrying over 2,000 commuters each day from the top of 
Washington Hill to Downtown Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Incline railways that fell by the wayside were the Mt. Oliver, Penn, 
Troy Hill, Castle Shannon and Nunnery Hill. Knoxville Incline, which operated 
from 1890 to 1960, had an unusual curved track. 
</P>
<P>
The Duquesne was shut down in 1962 and preparations were made to dismantle it 
when residents of Duquesne Heights formed the Society for the Preservation of 
the Duquesne Heights Incline. They conducted a series of fund-raisers to save 
the old railway. 
</P>
<P>
The Duquesne's fare is 75 cents each way for the 793-foot ride along a 58.5% 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
Pennsylvania's three Incline railways -- the Johnstown Inclined Plane, the 
Monongahela Incline and the Duquesne Incline -- are relics of the past which 
provide a service just as important today as when they were originally 
constructed in the 19th Century.

DEATH OF A DRIVE-IN;

<P>
PICKWICK THEATER SHUTS DOWN, ENDING AN ERA FOR BURBANK MOVIEGOERS AND FILM 
MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The closing of the Pickwick Drive-In Theatre not only marks the end of an era 
for Burbank moviegoers, but for movie makers who had used the outdoor theater 
for premieres and as a backdrop for films. 
</P>
<P>
The Pickwick, in the 1100 block of West Alameda Avenue, was a prime location 
for filming because of its proximity to Burbank Studios, which houses Walt 
Disney Co., Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
"It was convenient, just a few blocks away," Ron Chan, field publicist for 
Warner Bros., said. "It was easier to go there than other places." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Pickwick has been used to film scenes for such movies as 
"Blue Thunder," starring Roy Scheider; "Christine," featuring Keith Gordon; and 
"St. Ives," with Charles Bronson and Jacqueline Bisset. More recently, the 
theater was used to film a segment for the television series "The Outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
"I had to hold up demolition for a week so they could come in here and do their 
filming," said A. Terrance Dickens, director of real estate for Pacific 
Theatres Corp., which owns the Pickwick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed Sept. 10 
</P>
<P>
Dickens said the theater, which closed Sept. 10, will be torn down within the 
next few weeks to make way for, among other things, a 55,000-square-foot Vons 
Pavilion shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The 800-car Pickwick, at one time Burbank's only theater, is the second 
drive-in in the Valley to be shut down in the last two months. With the closing 
of the Pickwick and the Sepulveda Drive-In on Aug. 13, only two outdoor 
theaters are left in the Valley and seven in all of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad," Dickens said. But, he added, "things change." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, times have changed. A May 12, 1949, flyer advertised the grand opening 
of the Pickwick: "Clean, healthful entertainment under the stars for the entire 
family," the ad boasted, all for a mere 65 cents. The pictures featured on the 
theater's opening night were the action adventure "Red Stallion in the Rockies" 
and the Dorothy Lamour comedy "The Lucky Stiff." 
</P>
<P>
The theater was charging $4.50 for adults and $2.50 for teen-agers when it 
closed and still was losing money, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had banners, free drinks and popcorn . . . I remember Natalie Wood was on 
hand for the opening," said Frank Diaz, a veteran Pacific employee. Wood was 
only 12 at the time but already a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said the most memorable event at the theater was Warner Bros.' 1974 
premiere of Mel Brooks' western comedy "Blazing Saddles." 
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the theater, about 250 guests -- including the stars of 
the film, Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder -- came on horseback. Drive-in 
speakers were attached to saddle pommels and a "horsepitality bar" was set up 
in front of the huge outdoor screen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a promotion," Diaz said. "People got up on their horses and 
watched the movie. It was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual premiere was the brainchild of the late Warner Bros. publicist 
Marty Weiser. 
</P>
<P>
"It's legend around here," Chan said. "Mel Brooks was so pleased with the 
promotion that he wrote a letter praising Marty" for coming up with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Chan, like others, said he is disappointed with the decision to close the 
Pickwick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Sad' 
</P>
<P>
"It's really sad that Pacific is going to tear it down," Chan said. "I hate to 
see it go because it is a landmark. It's too bad we have to sacrifice 
historical things for the sake of progress." 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the Pickwick's closing, Diaz said, is that single-screen 
theaters are no longer profitable. Successful drive-ins, as well as 
conventional theaters, are multiscreen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pickwick sits on about 9 acres . . . Any single-screen drive-in is pretty 
much limited as an entertainment venue because there is no way to expand," Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Pickwick was the only place in Burbank for big-screen 
entertainment. That changed in 1988 when an AMC 10 Theatre opened near the 
downtown intersection of First Street and Palm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pickwick, Pacific officials said, already had experienced a significant 
decline in business the year before with the opening of the 18-screen Universal 
Cineplex in Universal City, a short drive from Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very successful over the years," Diaz said. "But business dropped off 
in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
The Pickwick hosted its last premiere in 1987. The screening of Alex Cox's 
"Straight to Hell" drew such stars as Dennis Hopper and Emilio Estevez, both of 
whom camped out with friends in a 1960s Ford Falcon. Actors Buck Henry, Shelley 
Duvall and Ed Harris also attended the screening. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said the two remaining Valley drive-ins, the Winnetka Drive-In and the Van 
Nuys Drive-In, owned by Pacific, have survived because they are multiscreen 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the two theaters, there are nine screens," he said. "They are doing 
very well. They are very successful." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some moviegoers insist, there was something special about the Pickwick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw Rolling Hills 
</P>
<P>
"At the Pickwick, you not only saw the screen but the rolling hills all around 
it. Nowhere else in the Valley can you get that kind of view," said Leslie 
Brogan, a former Burbank resident who attended one of the theater's last 
showings. 
</P>
<P>
Brogan, 28, said she had gone to the Pickwick for "as long as I can remember. I 
would go there with my high school friends. Sunday was the popular day to go. 
But we wouldn't watch the movies too much." 
</P>
<P>
Brogan admitted that the old drive-in was not as popular in recent years as it 
once had been. She said "only about 25 cars showed up" at the theater's last 
screening, a double feature of "Turner and Hooch" and "Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," Brogan said. "Who knows, maybe 10 years from now, there won't 
be any drive-ins." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank resident Rachel Smith, 18, said she will miss the Pickwick. 
</P>
<P>
"They're knocking down a piece of history," Smith said. "I didn't go there very 
often, but the times I went it was very groovy."

FLORA OF THE VALLEY: TELEGRAPH WEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the sunflower family, telegraph weed is a tall, hairy herb that 
blooms year-round along roadsides and in other open spaces in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The plant reaches heights of 7 feet and is strongly aromatic. The odor reminds 
one of creosote. 
</P>
<P>
Telegraph weed (Heterotheca grandiflora) does not have spectacular blossoms but 
the flowers, which grow in dense clusters near the tops of erect stems, do add 
splashes of color to otherwise bleak outdoor landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
The flat-topped yellow flowers are small, only about an inch across. They are 
supported by numerous narrow, green bracts. 
</P>
<P>
The flowers of camphor weed, the only other of the species Heterotheca in 
California, are even smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Telegraph weed's leaves grow abundantly on the stout stems. They are grayish 
green, oval-shaped and up to three inches long. The leaves are slightly 
toothed, have short white hairs on both sides and droop at night. 
</P>
<P>
Telegraph weed is a common sight in coastal sage scrub, chaparral and southern 
oak woodland plant communities. It can be found in Southern California 
mountains along hiking trails and along fire breaks but only at lower 
elevations. It also grows in the central part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was given its common name because of the long, straight stems that 
resemble telegraph poles.

ERMA BOMBECK: SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE GIVERS AMONG US 
</P>

By Erma Bombeck, Erma Bombeck is on a book tour. This Best of Bombeck column 
originally ran June 24, 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
I had a dream the other night that every volunteer in this country, 
disillusioned with the lack of compassion, had set sail for another country. 
</P>
<P>
As I stood smiling on the pier, I shouted, "Goodby, creamed chicken. Goodby, 
phone committees. So long, Disease of the Month. No more saving old egg 
cartons. No more getting out the vote. Au revoir, playground duty, bake sales 
and three-hour meetings." 
</P>
<P>
As the boat got smaller and they could no longer hear my shouts, I reflected, 
"Serves them right. A bunch of 'yes' people. All they had to do was to put 
their tongue firmly against the roof of their mouth and make an 'O' sound. 
Nnnooooooo. Nnnnnnooooo. Nnoo. No! No! It would certainly have spared them a 
lot of grief. Oh well, who needs them!" 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was quiet as I passed it. Rooms were void of books, flowers and 
voices. The children's wing held no clowns, no laughter. The reception desk was 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The home for the aged was like a tomb. The blind listened for a voice that 
never came. The infirm were imprisoned by wheels on a chair that never moved. 
Food grew cold on trays that would never reach the mouths of the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
All the social agencies had closed their doors, unable to implement their 
programs for scouting, recreation, drug control, Big Sisters, Big Brothers, 
YWCA, YMCA, the retarded, the crippled, the lonely and the abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The health agencies had a sign in the window: "Cures for cancer, muscular 
dystrophy, birth defects, multiple sclerosis, emphysema, sickle cell anemia, 
kidney disorders, heart diseases, etc. have been canceled due to lack of 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
The schools were strangely quiet, with no field trips, no volunteer aides on 
the playground or in the classroom -- as were the colleges, where scholarships 
and financial support were no more. 
</P>
<P>
The flowers on church altars withered and died. Children in day nurseries 
lifted their arms but there was no one to hold them in love. Alcoholics cried 
out in despair, but no one answered, and the poor had no recourse for health 
care or legal aid. 
</P>
<P>
But the saddest part of the journey was the symphony hall, which was dark and 
would remain that way. So were the museums that had been built and stocked by 
volunteers with the art treasures of our times. 
</P>
<P>
I fought in my sleep to regain a glimpse of the ship of volunteers just one 
more time. It was to be my last glimpse of civilization . . . as we were meant 
to be.

1 DEAD, 11 WOUNDED IN WEEKEND VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gang members in a confrontation with two police officers on a dark rooftop 
highlighted a weekend of gang-related violence, including half a dozen 
shootings that left one man dead and 11 other people wounded, authorities said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested a 17-year-old gang member on suspicion of 
conspiracy to commit murder in the confrontation late Friday, Lt. Ben Gering 
said. Officers Jerry Bautista, 28, and James Simoneschi, 42, both escaped 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to suspected gang activity, the officers had climbed atop a roof on 
South Westlake Avenue to scan the neighborhood west of downtown. The men were 
tailed by at least two gang members who may have been seeking to ambush a rival 
gang, Officer Rich Banister said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently (the gang members) went up there on purpose to get somebody," 
Banister said. After a confrontation with the officers, the 17-year-old, who 
was not identified, was arrested. Another youth, who was armed with a handgun, 
ran away. He is still being sought. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident Friday night, Martin Alberto Muratalla, 18, was shot and 
killed behind a home in Lynwood by rival gang members, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Muratalla and a companion, Pedro Ramos, 21, of Bell, were followed by four 
carloads of rival gang members who chased them into the back yard of a home on 
111th Street and fired at them with a shotgun, deputies said. Muratalla was 
taken to St. Francis Medical Center, where he died. Ramos was reported in 
serious condition at Harbor-UCLA Mecical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In another part of Lynwood, five people, including two teen-age brothers, were 
wounded when a man opened fire on the group in front of Hercules Burgers at 
Fernwood Avenue and Imperial Highway, Deputy Patrick Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman jumped out of nearby bushes, then shot at the group with a 
semiautomatic weapon, the deputy said. Two of the injured, Robert Garcia, 21, 
and Warren Gooden, 26, were reported in fair condition at St. Francis Medical 
Center. The others, who were not identified, were taken to area hospitals, 
where their conditions were described as ranging from serious to critical 
condition, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach early Saturday, gunfire from a speeding car on Santa Fe Avenue 
injured two men, Police Lt. Norman Eriksen said. The victims, whose names were 
not released, were treated for leg wounds at Pacific Hospital, where they were 
listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after the Long Beach shootings, a man nearby was critically 
wounded in what appeared to be a related drive-by shooting, Eriksen said. The 
man, whose name was not released, was shot in the buttocks and abdomen and was 
in critical condition at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, two teen-agers and four men were arrested Saturday as 
suspects in a drive-by shooting that wounded a 16-year-old standing in front of 
a house in Whittier Friday night, said Whittier Police Lt. Harold Sandifer. The 
suspects' names were not released and the victim, who was not identified, was 
reported in critical condition at Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, a 16-year-old Inglewood boy was critically wounded when he was 
shot at the Ladera Heights Shopping Center, Deputy Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Walker was on life-support systems at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 
after being shot as he and two friends walked in the shopping center, Hunter 
said. The attack occurred when Walker and his friends were approached by a 
group of six to eight teen-agers, the deputy said. No suspects have been 
arrested.

SHE DIES IN PARIS AT 81; 
</P>
<P>
LAVISH TRIBUTES POUR IN FOR FILM STAR BETTE DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lavish tributes flowed Saturday in a worldwide eulogy for Bette Davis, the 
tempestuous actress whose fiery talent and celebrated toughness made her one of 
Hollywood's most acclaimed and enduring stars. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, whose career spanned a half-century of American film, died Friday night 
of cancer in a suburban Paris hospital. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Academy Award winner, who began her career on the stage and later 
made the transition from movies to television, was in Europe to receive an 
award when she was admitted to a private hospital on the outskirts of the 
French capital. 
</P>
<P>
The news of Davis' death touched off an avalanche of praise from fellow actors 
and movie fans who called her a legendary figure in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, himself a one-time actor who appeared with 
Davis in the 1939 film "Dark Victory," described her as one of the "true 
greats" of the motion picture business. 
</P>
<P>
"She gave us some of the most memorable moments in the history of film and 
touched us in a way few others have. For Bette, acting was more than a 
profession, it was an art," Reagan said Saturday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"What a loss," echoed actress Olivia de Havilland, who worked with Davis in 
four films, including the 1964 "Hush . . . Hush Sweet Charlotte." 
</P>
<P>
"She was a remarkable person to work with, highly professional, innovative, 
brilliant and quick," said De Havilland, who lives in Paris. "She was very 
well-disciplined. I thought she had some marvelous personal qualities, and I 
was very fond of her." 
</P>
<P>
During her career, the staccato-voiced Davis made 86 movies, won two Academy 
Awards as best actress and was nominated for eight more. Her last movie was the 
1987 "Whales of August," a film she made despite being in failing health after 
suffering two strokes and a bout with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
When Davis arrived in Europe three weeks ago to receive an award at the San 
Sebastian Film Festival in northern Spain, news accounts said the actress gave 
a bravura performance at a news conference. Immaculate in a black dress and 
wide-brimmed hat, Davis even joked about her imminent death. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had waited a little longer," she said of the festival award, "I would 
not have been able to be here to receive it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dies in American Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Before returning home, however, Davis fell ill and was taken to the American 
Hospital in the Paris suburb of Neuilly. Her death was reported Saturday in a 
terse statement. 
</P>
<P>
"During a trip to Western Europe, the health of Miss Davis deteriorated," said 
hospital spokesman Philippe Duprat. "She was admitted at the hospital on Oct. 
3. She died last night as a consequence of her illness." 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Harold Schiff, said in Paris that his client had died of cancer. 
And in France, where her work is adored, Davis' death was front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
In its Saturday afternoon editions, the newspaper Le Monde reported 
breathlessly that the "impossible has happened" and that "the screen bitch with 
the too-big eyes, the ambitious devourer of Hollywood, the she-wolf" was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"One doesn't cry for Bette Davis," the newspaper continued reverently, "one 
salutes her." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Salute 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Davis received what may have been her greatest salute. Still spunky 
and working at 69, she became the first woman to receive the Life Achievement 
Award of the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose . . . they decided, 'Let's give it to a dame,' " she said with 
waspish delight upon receiving the honor. 
</P>
<P>
Some dame. 
</P>
<P>
Davis played them all, from the bitchy Southern belle in "Jezebel," which won 
her a second Oscar in 1938, to the dying heroine of "Dark Victory" a year 
later, to the frumpy Bronx housewife in "The Catered Affair" in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
But for many, she would forever be Margo Channing, the past-her-prime actress 
of the 1950 film, "All About Eve," her 61st movie, with that line that glistens 
in the memory: "Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Always in Control 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the role, Davis was herself always in control, refining emotion with 
intelligence. But the persona was better than the sum of her parts. More than 
beauty, she had style, wit and a fierce, unrelenting independence. 
</P>
<P>
Those penetrating blue eyes, the page-boy hairdo with the sharp slash of bangs, 
the ability to use a cigarette like a weapon or a scepter, and the flinty voice 
-- these became her trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
The breeding invariably showed, whether on screen in throwing aside a mink 
coat, or off, when she fought tigress-like with studio heads and directors, for 
good roles. In an era when studio executives behaved like Big Daddies, she 
achieved her own liberation.. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't dare to be hated," she told Playboy magazine in a lengthy 
interview in 1982, "you're never going to get there. Never!" 
</P>
<P>
For Davis, her reputation was of an intense perfectionist who battled studio 
moguls and movie directors, survived mediocre films and spurned the glamour 
image that Hollywood often demanded of its actresses. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Davis relied on her craft and unflinching confidence to build a career 
playing roles from spirited heroines to tough-talking villains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Role Model' 
</P>
<P>
"She once said to me, 'The thing about us, we're character actresses.' She 
wasn't a great beauty, and she knew that," fellow actress Angela Lansbury said 
Saturday. "She was a tremendous role model for me. She simply encouraged my 
aspirations as also not (being) a great beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Despite four marriages -- and romances with some rather distinguished men in 
between -- Davis owned up in later years to being lonely. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a woman all by yourself is absurd," she said in 1982 when she was 74. "I 
didn't intend to become one of those prim New England women who are afraid of 
sex, didn't want to reach my present age and not have experienced everything . 
. . had a full life. Now I'm a virgin again but I guess I did all right for a 
little Yankee girl." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the toughness there was vulnerability. She felt "All About Eve" saved 
her life, "professionally and personally. When I made it I had been hit by a 
truck, the same truck that hit Margo Channing . . . that I was 40. And I know 
Margo felt every one of those years hitting her." 
</P>
<P>
In her heyday -- from the mid-1930s to the close of World War II -- Davis was 
the highest paid woman in America. She was called "the first lady of the 
screen" and the "fourth Warner brother" and she was a regular on Oscar night. 
She was nominated as best actress in 1939 ("Dark Victory"), 1940 ("The 
Letter"), 1941 ("The Little Foxes"), 1942 ("Now, Voyager"), 1944 ("Mr. 
Skeffington"), as well as in 1950 ("All About Eve"), 1952 ("The Star"), and 
1962 ("Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Some Regrets 
</P>
<P>
Despite numerous triumphs, she had some regrets -- the missed Oscars and roles. 
She had wanted her first Oscar for the part of Mildred, the cruel waitress in 
Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" (1934) but instead won it as a 
consolation the following year for "Dangerous" in which she played a 
not-so-nice actress. 
</P>
<P>
She wanted one for playing Judith Traherne, the dying heroine in "Dark Victory" 
who falls in love with her doctor, but 1939 was the year of "Gone With the 
Wind," and she had won her second Oscar only the year before. Her lifelong 
regret was that she could have been Scarlett O'Hara but refused the role in a 
dispute with her boss, Jack L. Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Davis would have killed, she said, to have gotten the lead in "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" or to have been Anna in "The King and I." 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to Broadway after 22 years in 1952, it was for "Two's 
Company," and then, more notably, "The Night of the Iguana" in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, she turned to television and garnered showcase roles, more than 
holding her own with a newer generation of actresses. She won an Emmy in 1979 
for "Strangers," playing the mother of an estranged daughter (Gena Rowlands) 
who has come home to die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Had Endured 
</P>
<P>
By then everyone knew Davis was more than a mere survivor. She had endured. 
</P>
<P>
In her last years she combined her two personal worlds. She lived in a large 
condominium in West Hollywood which, except for its wide-screen view of Los 
Angeles, could have passed for a cottage in Maine. She was surrounded by 
artifacts of her movie years, as well by pottery, pewter and porcelain. As her 
adopted son Michael W. Merrill once said, her heart really belonged to New 
England, where she began. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Davis was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis on April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Mass. 
She was named for her mother, whom Bette in later years called Ruthie. Her 
daughter would later say that Ruthie was her dominating influence, at least 
through a first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, had been a patent attorney. The parents were 
divorced when Bette was 7. She had a younger sister, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rigidity of a strict New England upbringing, hers was a relatively 
happy and comfortable childhood, and she wrote of "those biting cold white days 
when Bobby and I would slide down the hill behind our house on our backsides 
without our sleds . . . the kitchen shiny and busy and expectant with custards 
and fruit pies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wonderful Cook 
</P>
<P>
In later years her kitchen became her solace, her refuge, and she was 
remembered by her friends as a wonderful cook. 
</P>
<P>
She and her sister were sent off to boarding school while her mother worked as 
a photographer. At 16, Bette entered the prestigious Cushing Academy in 
Ashburnham, Mass., where, after participating in school theatricals, she 
decided to become an actress. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation in 1926, she was taken by her mother to New York where she met 
Eva LaGalliene, then a reigning stage presence. LaGalliene was unimpressed. She 
told the aspiring actress that her attitude toward the theater was "not 
sincere. You are a frivolous little girl." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to negate that judgment, Davis enrolled at a dramatic academy in New 
York and also worked briefly in Rochester in a play called "Broadway." The 
director was George Cukor, soon to become another Hollywood legend. He fired 
her. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cukor company Davis went to the Provincetown Players, an off-Broadway 
company in Greenwich Village. There in 1929 at age 21 she had a starring role 
in "The Earth Between," a drama, improbable for those days, about incest on a 
Nebraska farm. Brooks Atkinson wrote in the New York Times: "Miss Davis, who is 
making her first professional appearance, is an entrancing creature who plays 
in a soft, unassertive role." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coveted Ibsen Role 
</P>
<P>
Next she sought the coveted role of Hedvig in Ibsen's "The Wild Duck." Davis 
failed to get the part and was relegated to the role of usherette. But she 
persisted and during the next two years, she was in more than half a dozen 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, Hollywood beckoned. Universal became her first Hollywood studio. In a 
little over a year she made a half-dozen forgettable movies -- three for 
Universal, three for other studios to which she was loaned out -- but nothing 
really worked for her. The studio moguls decided she had "the sex appeal of a 
string bean." 
</P>
<P>
Davis might have returned to the stage for good had not George Arliss, a 
leading actor of the period, telephoned. He was to be the lead in "The Man Who 
Played God," and he wanted her to co-star. He had seen her on stage and liked 
her work. On the strength of that 1932 movie Warner's signed her to an 11-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two years -- until "Of Human Bondage" -- she did 14 movies but only 
a few gave her the chance to display her talents. It was then that she began 
her fight for good scripts, good parts and a good cast. For, as she later 
wrote, she realized early on that she needed good people to play against. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, she got the "Bondage" role because she persuaded a bright young 
director named Pandro S. Berman, who was working for RKO, to take her on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Into Front Rank 
</P>
<P>
With "Bondage" and "Dangerous," her first Oscar, she moved into the front rank 
of Hollywood actresses, but she was never of them. At first, directors wanted 
to make her over, even to change her name. Bettina Dawes was suggested; Davis 
resisted. "I refuse to be called 'Between the Drawers' all my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At 5 feet, 3 inches and 112 pounds, she was certainly not a long-stemmed blonde 
bombshell beauty, although in the beginning they lightened her hair. Davis had 
a more subtle sexuality. Of the Crawfords and the Shearers and the Dietrichs, 
she wrote: "Part of me envied them. They were so beautiful. I knew it was 
possible, with my ambitions for acting rather than for glamour, that I might 
never equal their popularity. But I was I." 
</P>
<P>
She also noted that over the years she drew more people into movie houses "than 
all the sexpots put together." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was married four times -- to Hamilton O. Nelson, Jr., a prep school 
sweetheart, in 1932; to Arthur Farnsworth, who ran a New England inn, in 1938; 
to William Grant Sherry, a former prize fighter-turned-Laguna Beach artist in 
1945, and to actor Gary Merrill in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
She had three children from those marriages, including a daughter, Barbara 
Davis or B.D., who was born in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' other two children were adopted. Daughter Margot was discovered to be 
severely brain damaged and had to be sent to an Upstate New York institution 
for the mentally retarded. Later, there was a prolonged custody battle with 
Merrill over their adopted son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mother Goddam' 
</P>
<P>
Through it all was her craft. Work was her "steadiest friend." In interviews, 
in her frank 1962 autobiography "The Lonely Life" and in the biography she 
co-authored in 1974 called "Mother Goddam" (a sobriquet for one of her 
characters that she took as her own), that was her theme. 
</P>
<P>
"My passions were all gathered together like fingers that made a fist," she 
wrote in 1962. "Drive is considered aggression today; I knew it then as 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, from the time she received her first Oscar, she fought, 
even scratched for good parts. Consider that "Of Human Bondage" was her 22nd 
role, "Dangerous" her 28th and "Jezebel" her 36th. 
</P>
<P>
After "Dangerous," when she was again being offered what she felt were 
minor-league roles, she accepted an offer from an English film director and 
Warner's smacked her with an injunction. She had "no right to strike" a studio, 
or to be a free agent, as baseball players were to become many years later. 
</P>
<P>
There followed a long legal battle that Davis lost -- "It was Bette against 
Goliath," she opined dramatically. But in a real sense, she won the war because 
Warner's brought her back to better roles. In 1939, all four of her movies were 
critical and box office successes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breaks With Warners 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, she broke with Warners for good. During the next decade, she appeared 
in 10 films but her career appeared to be faltering. Davis, however, revived it 
with a couple of popular horror films including 1962's "Whatever Happened to 
Baby Jane?" where she played a demented one-time child star. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether Davis made nine movies in the 1960s and five in the 1970s, as well 
as starting a new career in television. One of her last TV movies was "Right of 
Way" made for Home Box Office, in which she co-starred with James Stewart -- 
the first time these movie greats had played together. 
</P>
<P>
"She seemed to me to be an ideal motion picture actress," Stewart recalled 
Saturday, calling Davis "this wonderful, wonderful talent." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there was always a touch of the irreverent, the unexpected, about Bette 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
She became the first woman president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences in 1942 and thereafter insisted that she had played a prime role in 
the naming of the little statuette given out each year for film achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"The rear end of it looked like my first husband's, Ham Nelson's, bare behind." 
Nelson's middle name was Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story Is Pure Davis 
</P>
<P>
If the story was apocryphal it was also pure Davis. 
</P>
<P>
She shunned Hollywood parties. She twitted her own movies calling the horror 
film "Baby Jane" "pretty funny." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose the dead birds with mayonnaise were kind of unattractive. And the 
dead rat." 
</P>
<P>
She also chided the male ego which she felt "with few exceptions . . . was 
elephantine to start with. Add to it a movie contract and it soars through 
space into eternal orbit around itself." 
</P>
<P>
But mostly she had the capacity to laugh at herself. One night at a one-woman 
appearance in London someone in the audience rudely called out: "Is that your 
real hair, Miss Davis?" 
</P>
<P>
Without missing a beat, Davis, who was wearing a wig that day, called back: 
"Yes it is. And these are my real eyes, my real teeth and my real tits." 
</P>
<P>
But the icy irreverence could also thaw. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Canteen 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, she helped organize the Hollywood Canteen, which became a refuge for 
servicemen stationed in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
An animal lover, she was founder and president of the Tailwaggers Club, which 
looked after stray dogs. A resident of Laguna in the late 1950s, she 
participated in the Laguna Festival of the Arts. As with other volunteer 
residents, she did the grunt work, sticking numbers on the backs of seats. 
</P>
<P>
But first, as always, she served her talent. Into the so-called retirement 
years she was still perusing scripts, still demanding that her name be placed 
above the title. She did the TV talk show circuit, ever entertainingly blunt. 
</P>
<P>
When she was nearly 75, a TV producer approached her for an appearance on 
something he was preparing called "The Golden Years of Hollywood." Davis, 
probably as representative of those times as anyone, declined. 
</P>
<P>
As she told a close friend over dinner: "There is no such thing as 'the golden 
years.' Why look back?" 
</P>
<P>
The golden years, Bette Davis told her friend, were in the present. And she 
still had work to do. 
</P>

SENATE SCRAPS SURTAX ON ELDERLY, SAVES SOME CATASTROPHIC BENEFITS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate broke with the House Friday and voted to retain some catastrophic 
illness benefits for the elderly while also scrapping the income-based surtax 
that led to howls of protest from senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved a bill by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) that eliminates the 
surtax for wealthier senior citizens as well as caps on doctor fees and 
prescription-drug costs. It retains hospitalization coverage financed by a flat 
monthly fee paid by all of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional negotiators will next have to work out a compromise between the 
House-passed outright repeal and the pared-down program approved by the Senate 
or choose one of the two approaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate cleared the way for consideration of the McCain plan by voting 73 to 
26 against a motion for repeal sponsored by Sens. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) and 
William V. Roth (R-Del.). 
</P>
<P>
The Catastrophic Coverage Act, the largest expansion in Medicare's 24-year 
history, was enacted last year to prevent an extended illness from wiping out a 
senior citizen's savings. At that time, it was hailed as a milestone of 
President Ronald Reagan's second term and as a model for programs that would be 
financed by the people who benefited from them. 
</P>
<P>
But the surtax came under harsh attack from seniors who objected to being 
singled out for a tax increase, and the House voted 360 to 66 Wednesday to 
repeal the greatest expansion of benefits in the 24-year history of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders united early in the debate behind a proposal introduced by Sen. 
Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) that would have reduced the surtax while keeping the 
hospital benefit and the cap on doctor fees. 
</P>
<P>
But after its defeat on a 62-37 vote, those who wanted to preserve some 
catastrophic benefits embraced the McCain proposal, which Republican leader 
Robert Dole of Kansas called "the next-best option." 
</P>
<P>
"The McCain proposal gives us the opportunity to move away from the surtax . . 
. (and) provide protection," said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.). "I think we should 
say no to the income tax and yes to senior citizens, we are going to give you 
some protection." 
</P>
<P>
Danforth argued that a vote for repeal would open the way to consideration of 
new plans for a comprehensive solution to the health problems of the elderly 
and the nation and criticized the McCain approach as incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits Duplicated 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of health insurance is not going to go away. . . . There is only one 
reason to vote against repeal -- you believe the McCain proposal is the way to 
go in catastrophic health insurance," he said. "Why write into law a program 
that we are not sure of?" 
</P>
<P>
Other repeal supporters argued that even with financing changes, the 
catastrophic plan duplicates benefits seniors already have and failed to give 
them the coverage they really want -- such as for custodial nursing home care. 
</P>
<P>
"The plain truth is the American people understand that this program stinks," 
said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of repeal said such an action would make it harder to pass future 
health legislation and argued that it would backfire on millions of the elderly 
-- many already receiving hospital coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Will Die' 
</P>
<P>
"If we repeal this bill, people will die and/or go bankrupt," protested Sen. 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
The original bill included a surtax that would hit 28% with a $1,050 limit for 
the wealthiest senior citizens in 1993. The McCain bill would eliminate the 
surtax. All financing would come from the flat fee, which starts at $4 a month 
this year and rises to $10.20 a month by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would eliminate the $1,370 limit on out-of-pocket doctor fees as 
well as the prescription-drug benefit, which would have covered the bulk of 
costs once a patient had paid $600. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits retained by McCain include 365 days of free hospitalization after 
payment of a deductible of $560 this year, Medicaid benefits preventing spousal 
impoverishment, home health care, respite care, mammography screening, 
intravenous and immunosuppressive drugs and hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan had endorsed the 
Durenberger plan Thursday, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told 
reporters Friday that the Adminstration was not supporting any specific 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a situation yesterday in which there was a misunderstanding between 
the secretary of HHS and the Administration," Fitzwater said. "We have told the 
Senate that we would not take a position on any of those (plans)." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen criticized the White House for 
failing to take a position before the vote, asking on the floor, "Where is the 
leadership from the Administration?" 
</P>
<P>
McCain argued against the Durenberger proposal because it retained the surtax. 
He said the costs of the catastrophic program in that proposal would rise and 
that as long as it had a surtax, it would go up too. 
</P>
<P>
"The object of the anger of the seniors today is the surtax," he said. "Sooner 
or later that surtax will increase."

<P>
When Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs visited Poland recently, he 
found an economy straight out of "Alice in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
Because air travel is heavily subsidized by the government, a 180-mile plane 
ride from Warsaw to Gdansk cost the equivalent of $2.90. A fading post card 
cost a quarter of a cent because the state stationery store had not thought to 
keep prices current. 
</P>
<P>
As an adviser to the new Solidarity-run government, which is trying to move 
Poland back through the Communist looking glass and toward a free-market 
economy, Sachs hardly knows where to begin. 
</P>
<P>
He and most other outsiders prescribe nothing less than the kind of 
off-with-their-heads solution that the Queen of Hearts would have ordered -- 
dismantling Poland's economy and building a new one from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Recraft Industry 
</P>
<P>
The pricing system must be reformed, most economists believe, so that prices 
reflect supply and demand. The agricultural sector must be uprooted so that the 
country can feed itself. Industry must be recrafted without the heavy subsidies 
that have kept inefficient factories alive. The Poles must begin to build such 
basic economic fixtures as a stock market, banks and other credit facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's new government on Friday announced just such a program, designed to 
quickly begin conversion to a market economy by Dec. 31. Warsaw said it hopes 
to win approval of its plan by late November by the 152-country International 
Monetary Fund, in time for Western nations to begin new loans and debt-relief 
programs in early December. 
</P>
<P>
"What we must do is a quick transformation of the present economic system into 
a market system," Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz told a news conference in 
Warsaw. "We have a great and unrepeatable chance" to adopt "a system whose 
effectiveness is proven all over the world. But we have to do it in a very 
difficult economic situation." 
</P>
<P>
During the transition, economists acknowledge, Poland will have to endure 
extraordinary trauma -- hyperinflation, deep recession, conspicuous shortages 
and a serious erosion of living standards -- as it moves in fits and starts 
toward a new economic order. The political pressure will be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to have to suffer, and they have to have faith that 
short-term decreases in living standards will bring longer-term gains," said 
Charles Movit, an economist at PlanEcon, a consulting firm that specializes in 
Eastern Europe. "The question in Poland is, are people going to accept 
Solidarity's word for it?" 
</P>
<P>
Poland is not alone at the brink of the free-market abyss. Other Eastern Bloc 
countries -- including the Soviet Union -- have either started down a similar 
path or at least considered it. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economy, the oldest and most rigid among the Communist states, is in 
many ways the worst off, with extreme inflation in a few already private 
sectors and severe shortages of food and other goods. In the face of strikes 
and ethnic rivalries, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has postponed 
liberalization of prices indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia is not far behind but the system there has been made more 
workable by an easing earlier of some restraints. Hungary, which began its 
shift years ago, is far ahead of other Eastern Bloc states. East Germany has 
yet to begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Blueprint' 
</P>
<P>
"There really is no blueprint," Movit said. "No one has ever done what they are 
trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Poland has settled one issue by forgoing gradualism in favor of what is known 
as the Big Bang approach -- an all-at-once conversion to a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"If you decontrol only some prices, you sometimes make the situation worse, not 
better," explained Brookings Institution economist Robert Z. Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence cites the example of China, which removed controls on agriculture but 
neglected to decontrol consumer goods as well. As a result, when farmers came 
to the cities to buy goods, they cleaned out the stores and drove urban prices 
up. 
</P>
<P>
But a sudden transformation will also would pose difficulties. of its own. For 
one thing, the kinds of steps Poland plans -- must take to make the switch -- 
such as devaluing its currency and cutting back its government subsidies -- are 
almost certain to intensify inflation and worsen the current economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem is how to adjust so that at the same time our domestic 
situation doesn't deteriorate," Balcerowicz said during the recent 
International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists also fear that giving private interests control of industries 
and holding wages down may not be possible for a socialist government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift May Be Impossible 
</P>
<P>
University of Maryland Prof. Bartlomiej Kaminski, writing in the Financial 
Times, said that he fears that industry has become so concentrated that it may 
be impossible to shift to the kind of competition traditionally expected from a 
"private sector." 
</P>
<P>
As an interim step, Kaminski said, he favors "autonomization" -- breaking up 
Poland's huge, state-run sectors into smaller units that can be forced to 
compete with each other. Only then, he argued, can the government successfully 
remove price and currency controls. 
</P>
<P>
For the longer term, Western economists are looking to help Poland and other 
willing Eastern European nations do nothing less than replace 
government-controlled economies with free markets. 
</P>
<P>
Under communism, the government distributes goods from place to place largely 
by rationing -- much like a supply chit in the military. Money is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Free markets, by contrast, allocate goods through prices and wages that are 
based primarily on the available supply and demand for each product or service. 
</P>
<P>
It is a long way from one system to the other. For starters, Western 
economists, concentrating for now on Poland, prescribe these steps: 
</P>
<P>
* First, authorities must establish a system of wages and prices that actually 
reflects reality and is not influenced by subsidies and other government 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
That means unifying Poland's current multi-tiered exchange rate -- the Polish 
zloty trades officially at several different values, depending on what it is 
being used for -- and stabilizing it at a realistic level against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
* Next comes the Polish agricultural system. Although Poland already allows its 
farmers to own land, the rest of the farm sector -- tractors, seed, fertilizer 
and technology -- are rationed by the state and need to be made more widely 
available for crop yields to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Also important is to begin a massive agricultural extension program to teach 
Polish farmers how to farm. Under Poland's state planning, most farmers have 
learned to raise only a single crop and lack the knowledge needed to modernize 
and diversify. 
</P>
<P>
* The Poles then must put as much of their industry as they can into private 
hands -- that is, sell it to private citizens or investors. What cannot be sold 
off must be made to operate at a profit. Currently, money-losing factories are 
financed by the government, bloating the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
That means ending state monopolies and eliminating the massive government 
subsidies that help keep prices artificially low and enable Polish companies to 
continue operating at a loss and making products that prove uncompetitive in 
international markets. 
</P>
<P>
* Poland must also deregulate the economy and eliminate rules, such as 
prohibitions against business deals and advertising, that impede business 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Only then, say U.S. economists, will Poland be able to attract the substantial 
foreign investment that it will need to build its economy. "You have to know 
that if you go into business you won't be at risk," said Harald B. Malmgren, a 
Washington-based trade and economic consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Poland must develop a comprehensive social security and unemployment benefits 
system that can provide a safety net for individuals who are displaced in the 
conversion to a market economy. Otherwise, said Eugenio Lari, the World Bank's 
top Poland expert, the Polish people will lack the needed confidence to gamble 
on new jobs and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," he said, "they are afraid that if they are thrown in the street, 
they won't survive." 
</P>
<P>
Any new economic plan must involve tight money and credit policies, sharp cuts 
in spending and a hold-down on wage increases, all to help temper the 
inevitable burst of inflation that will result when prices are freed up in the 
face of soaring demand and increasing shortages. PlanEcon's Movit estimates 
that Poland's inflation rate has recently soared to about 50% a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glut of Unusable Money 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, where authorities have postponed reforming the pricing 
system, the results have been serious shortages of goods and a glut of unusable 
money. If the Soviet government does not sop up the excess money -- say, by 
allowing people to buy their own houses or selling special new treasury bonds 
-- before allowing market forces to set price levels, most Western economists 
believe that inflation will explode as too much money chases too few goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also will have to clamp down on wage increases, according to 
Western economists, until purchasing power is in line with the Soviets' ability 
to produce. 
</P>
<P>
To many economists, however, the problems posed by the transition are more 
political than economic. Breaking up the traditional central control of the 
economy means stripping the entrenched bureaucracy of its longstanding 
stranglehold over economic decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
And the inevitable bouts of hyperinflation and then unemployment -- combined 
with a sharp reduction in living standards -- portend political turmoil that 
would be difficult under any economic system. 
</P>
<P>
Brookings' Lawrence, who took a firsthand look last year at the Soviet economy, 
is not confident about the future. "I came away totally pessimistic," he said. 
"I guess you're not going to do it without tremendous political cost." 
</P>
<P>
Poland bit the bullet last week. Early in the week it devalued the zloty by 
20%, the first of many such devaluations expected. Market forces should 
ultimately drive the zloty's value far lower than the state-controlled rate and 
that, in turn, should make Polish products cheaper and, therefore, more 
competitive on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Friday, the government outlined a sweeping two-phase program that will 
provide for rapid conversion to a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Phase 1, to be instituted by Dec. 31, will involve loosening state ownership of 
property, breaking up government-owned monopolies, reforming the state budget, 
revamping the banking system, creating new unemployment benefits and 
streamlining state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift to Private Enterprise 
</P>
<P>
In Phase 2, to begin early next year, Poland will launch a major new effort to 
curb inflation by revamping the budget and tax system and ending credit and 
subsidies to government-owned corporations. It also plans to convert many 
state-owned enterprises to private ownership and to create a bond and stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Most important and perhaps most risky, Poland will try to hold wage increases 
down -- even in the face of soaring prices -- by limiting previously automatic 
pay boosts tied to the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
"We must introduce a wage-and-price policy that will stop the inflationary 
process," Balcerowicz said. "Without approval of this point, I can see no 
chance for leading Poland out of its crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The new turn toward capitalism has caught Western nations, particularly the 
United States, divided over whether and how far to help the Eastern Bloc states 
modernize. 
</P>
<P>
Wary of the mistakes of the 1970s, when the West "threw money" at Poland's 
fledgling reform efforts, White House officials and many U.S. allies have urged 
caution. They argue that all aid should be held up until Poland actually begins 
to make specific reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence Is Needed 
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting not to do very much of anything until the basic steps have 
occurred -- until there is evidence of economic restructuring," said Barber B. 
Conable Jr., president of the World Bank, which is considering a $300-million 
loan to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
But congressional Democrats, anxious to outdo President Bush, are pressing for 
a far more ambitious program that ultimately could top $1 billion. As a result, 
the Administration and Congress have launched into a virtual bidding war, with 
the White House announcing last week another $200 million in aid to Poland, in 
part to head off the congressional push. 
</P>
<P>
The money will supplement about $119 million in new U.S. aid that the President 
announced during his visit to Poland in July and another $108 million approved 
after Solidarity took power. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also will help Poland hammer out accords with the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank that could lead to about $800 million in new loans 
from those institutions. European countries and Japan are launching similar 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States is providing a spate of technical assistance, 
not only to Poland but to other East Bloc states. Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan is traveling to Moscow this weekend to advise the 
Soviets on how to reform their economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Mobilize Support 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher recently returned from Poland with a 
plan for mobilizing support from U.S. business. And Washington plans to send 
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter to Warsaw to discuss ways to free up 
Poland's farm sector. 
</P>
<P>
Private experts, too, are heading for the East in droves. Lawrence noted that 
almost a dozen economists from the Brookings Institution here were out of town 
last week on advisory missions to East Bloc countries. The IMF and World Bank 
also are sending teams of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has also offered $250 million in food aid. 
</P>
<P>
Balcerowicz says that Poland hopes to use the first $500 million of the new aid 
to help unify and stabilize its exchange rate. The rest will go to help enable 
Poland to keep buying needed imported goods during the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the latest round of economic changes, PlanEcon's Movit saw reason 
for hope. "If you begin with clear timetables, there can be clear progress as 
well," Movit asserted. "In six months, the entire Polish economy should be 
redone. I have confidence that it won't be rolled back."

ARGENTINA PARDONS 'DIRTY WAR' FIGURES 
</P>

<P>
President Carlos Saul Menem, saying he wanted to heal lingering wounds, 
announced pardons Saturday for 39 military and police commanders charged in the 
killings of thousands of civilians in Argentina's "dirty war" against left-wing 
subversion in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Menem also pardoned 64 guerrillas accused of taking part in violence that led 
to a military coup in 1976 and then years of brutal repression of government 
foes. 
</P>
<P>
However, he excluded from the pardon -- for now -- the only guerrilla now 
serving a jail term and six senior officers charged with, or convicted of, 
human rights crimes, including two imprisoned former military presidents of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, who spent five years in jail during the dictatorship, also absolved 174 
military officers who took part in three uprisings against former President 
Raul Alfonsin's government. Alfonsin took office after the military regime 
stepped down in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, who took office in July, said he hoped the sweeping pardons would end 
the recriminations of recent years and allow Argentines to look to the future, 
concentrating on rebuilding democratic institutions and emerging from the worst 
economic morass in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
"That those who died fighting for their ideals rest in peace; that their memory 
not serve to divide Argentines; that their blood serve to unite us more, to 
create for ourselves, for our children and for our children's children, an 
atmosphere of peace, of progress, of well-being," Menem said in one of the 
decrees granting the pardons. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin, of the Radical Civic Union, had made human rights and the restoration 
of the rule of law a cornerstone of his government, and his government's 
prosecution of former military junta members was a unique event in Latin 
America. At least 9,000 civilians disappeared and were presumed killed during 
the military regime's campaign to crush guerrilla bands and other leftist 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism From Some 
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups and most opposition parties said that the pardons amounted 
to caving in to military pressure for absolution and would serve notice to the 
unrepentant armed forces that they could expect immunity for gross abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure whether it's fear, or a promise he (Menem) made to them (the 
armed forces), or that he seriously believes this will end the uprisings, but 
he is wrong," said Rene de Epelbaum, a leader of the Mothers of the Plaza de 
Mayo whose three children disappeared during the dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"These insurrections now are going to recur each time that these soldiers see 
something that they don't like," she said. "A blackmailer always asks for more. 
After this, the armed forces will want a monument to show they were all heroes, 
brave warriors." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the pardons covered 280 people, including two former military 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
It excluded four former military junta members who were convicted of human 
rights offenses and sentenced to long prison terms, including former President 
Jorge R. Videla. Also excluded were former Buenos Aires police chief Ramon 
Camps, serving a 25-year prison sentence, and Carlos Guillermo Suarez Mason, a 
former 1st Army Corps commander who was extradited from the United States to 
face human rights charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebel Leader Excluded 
</P>
<P>
Menem also omitted Mario Firmenich, leader of the once-feared Montonero 
guerrillas. The Montoneros, whose ranks included many one-time members of 
Menem's Peronist party, carried out some of the fiercest rebel attacks in the 
1970s. Firmenich was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the 1975 kidnapings of 
Juan and Jorge Born, members of a prominent business family that is playing a 
central role in Menem's economic program. 
</P>
<P>
However, the president has said that the convicted former junta members and 
Firmenich will also be pardoned before the end of the year in a second stage of 
his program of "national reconciliation and pacification." 
</P>
<P>
He did include among those pardoned Gen. Albano Harguindegui, who was facing 
charges initiated in a complaint by Menem himself. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate decree, Menem also pardoned former President Leopoldo F. 
Galtieri, air force Lt. Gen. Basilio A. Lami Dozo and Adm. Jorge I. Anaya, who 
were sentenced last October to 12 years in prison for negligence in their 
handling of Argentina's war against Britain in 1982 over the Falkland Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Galtieri benefited twice: He was pardoned both for the Falklands accusation and 
separate, pending human rights charges in the interior Argentine cities of 
Rosario and Parana. 
</P>
<P>
The military rebellions against Alfonsin were motivated primarily by younger 
officers' demands that charges against officers be dropped and that jailed 
former junta members be freed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concessions Made 
</P>
<P>
After each uprising, Alfonsin made concessions limiting the number of 
prosecutions, and the confrontations ended without fighting. It was unclear 
each time whether loyalist troops actually would have opened fire against the 
rebels had they been ordered to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Menem pardoned more than 100 officers who took part in the rebellions, 
including Col. Mohamed Seineldin, leader of last December's uprising, and Lt. 
Col. Aldo Rico, who led the first two revolts in April, 1987, and January, 
1988. The military high command now will decide whether the two officers are to 
be retired or remain on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
All of the lower-ranking officers who took part in the uprisings also were 
pardoned, along with five civilians who helped take over the Buenos Aires 
airport in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church had endorsed Menem's decision to resolve the 
civilian-military conflict once and for all, as had major business 
organizations. But thousands of opponents joined a march against the expected 
pardons last month, and several organizations have vowed to fight the pardons 
in court, saying that the rule of law should prevail if true democracy is to 
endure.

Every day, Stephanie Lynn Marshall takes almost a dozen drugs through a tube 
into her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Clonopin and Tegretol to control her seizures. Codeine, Tylenol and Percodan 
for pain. Atarax, Adapin, Lorazapam and Valium to relieve anxiety. Tussionex to 
clear her lungs. Maalox to settle her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
She is only 12, but she is blind and mute. Her body jerks; her stiffened legs 
are crossed like scissors, and her hipbones are being gradually pulled from 
their sockets. She stopped talking when she was 4 1/2. Tears are her words, and 
crying is a great effort. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie's 4-foot-5-inch frame is wasted by a terminal brain disorder, a 
genetic, degenerative illness known as Batten's Disease. The ordeal she and her 
family are suffering is a case history in the debate over the right to die. It 
also underscores the need for guidelines in dealing with dying children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mourns for Daughter 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Marshall weeps for her only child. "We mourn for what we thought our 
children would be; we mourn for what they are, and we mourn for what they never 
will be," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
She cannot even hold her daughter because moving Stephanie increases the pain 
in her limbs. "The hardest thing I have ever done is to stand with her when she 
is crying and know that I do not have it within my capacity to change that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Marshall did have the capacity to change policies that might have kept her 
daughter hooked to life-sustaining machines when her body finally fails her. 
Because of her mother's efforts, Stephanie, when she dies, will die peacefully 
and without artificial heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Before Marshall lobbied the Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation, dying 
patients within its care were always resuscitated unless doctors certified that 
death would occur within weeks. Now, department guidelines extend this 
conditional authorization to withhold resuscitation to cases like Stephanie's, 
in which the time of death cannot be predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Stephanie will live as long as she chooses and that when she 
dies that will also be her choice," Marshall said. "And when she goes, I won't 
lift a hand to stop her." 
</P>
<P>
Right-to-die cases have prompted ethical and legal debates. The U.S. Supreme 
Court recently agreed to hear its first right-to-die case, a Missouri couple 
who want to remove their brain-damaged daughter from life support. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, debate turned to desperation. An Illinois man held medical workers 
at gunpoint in a Chicago hospital while he disconnected his 15-month-old 
comatose son from life support and cradled him in his arms until he died. 
Fearing prosecution, the hospital had refused to unhook the child despite the 
family's requests. A grand jury refused to indict the father. 
</P>
<P>
No adequate national guidelines exist for the care of terminally ill children, 
said Fenella Rouse, acting director of the Society for the Right to Die in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
At the society's urging, a panel of doctors, nurses, attorneys, ethicists and 
parents will gather Nov. 2-4 in Tarrytown, N.Y., to propose such guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Although many of us feel strongly that parents should be the major decision 
maker for children . . . physicians and hospitals have an obligation to protect 
the interests of children if parents are making bad decisions," said Alan 
Fleischman, a New York pediatrician who will lead the group. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is: How do we determine when parents' decisions are bad? . . . 
And, what safeguards should we have for children? Should there be ethics 
committees? Should there be federally mandated reviews?" 
</P>
<P>
An American Medical Assn. report says physicians should respect the wishes of 
terminally ill patients or their families on whether to apply lifesaving 
measures. When doctors and families agree on treatment for the patient, the 
report says, there is less likelihood of the courts' stepping in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Parents Agree 
</P>
<P>
In Stephanie's case, both parents agree that she should not be resuscitated. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine and James Marshall were divorced almost three years ago, driven apart 
by the stress and anger they felt over Stephanie's illness. 
</P>
<P>
"That anger, even if not directed at the other party, takes a toll on the 
relationship," Marshall said. "The blessing is that Stephanie's father and I 
both love her very much and we can work together on her behalf." 
</P>
<P>
James Marshall, a 38-year-old construction company manager who lives in Mystic, 
Conn., said it would serve "no purpose just to revive her so she can die again. 
To keep her alive at this point with a disease that's incurable is only keeping 
her alive for my wife and myself for our own feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Marshall left her job as an elementary school music teacher in 1981 
to care for Stephanie at home. But as the child grew older and bigger, it 
became difficult for the Marshalls to move her and to deal with the disease's 
growing complications. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, she was moved into Ann's Nursery for Babies in Norfolk, a home 
for handicapped children. The private nursery accepts some patients placed by 
the Department of Mental Retardation and therefore follows its guidelines on 
resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Marshall, 41, now an administrative assistant at Yale University, 
generally visits Stephanie once every other week, driving the 65 miles one way 
from her home in New Haven. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Stef, Mommy's here, I love you," she says at the child's bedside. She 
reads stories and serenades Stephanie, accompanying herself on an electronic 
Autoharp. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Stephanie's eyes are closed most of the time, Marshall is sure that 
her daughter knows when her mother is there.

'THIS IS A PLACE THAT TIME HAS FORGOTTEN'; 
</P>
<P>
'COLONY' MAY THRUST LEPERS INTO BRIGHT LIGHT OF 20TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CARVILLE, La. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cemetery marker identifies those who have died here by number, and 
sometimes by a nickname: "Teddy" or "Mrs. D." or "B.J." 
</P>
<P>
The shame of leprosy has robbed them of their names even on the roster of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
The lepers came here to hide or be hidden. Some came years ago in shackles, 
exiled by law. Others, more recently, came by choice to this institution for 
the treatment of Hansen's disease, or leprosy. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to end the hiding, the director of the facility says. No new patient 
will be allowed to live here. He has proposed that most of the work of the 
federal institution be moved to Baton Rouge, and that patients be treated where 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably the last nation on Earth to still maintain a colony for 
leprosy," said the director, Dr. John C. Duffy. "This is a place that time has 
forgotten. It lives in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, a colony like this is a disgrace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decentralizing Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Duffy calls his plan for the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center a 
"restructuring," not a closing. About 130 resident patients will be allowed to 
stay, under care reduced to about the level of a nursing home. A study to 
determine the cost of moving the other departments 35 miles to Baton Rouge must 
be finished before the plan is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he believes that the end has come to this chapter in the treatment 
of the biblical scourge. The disease has been so feared because of the leper's 
appearance. The slow-moving bacteria attack nerves in the cool extremities of 
the body -- the hands, feet, nose and ears. With the loss of sensation, unfelt 
injuries and eventual bone deterioration, a patient often looks scarred and 
grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
Isolation is not needed now, and never really was, Duffy said. Even untreated 
leprosy is difficult to transmit to others, and within a week of beginning 
medication, progress of the disease is arrested and a patient becomes 
non-contagious. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you see here is an anachronism. It is not today. It's yesterday. It 
does not reflect the current knowledge about Hansen's disease," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Donaldson knows of the yesterdays. Her father brought her here 61 years 
ago, when she was 21. Without a word, he left her on the front steps, her 
disfigured face hidden under the wide brim of a hat. She never saw him again. 
Now she sees no one. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked and pleaded with my brothers when I started to go blind, to let me see 
my father one more time. They wouldn't let me back in the house," she said. "I 
wrote them letters and said 'I'm human, too.' " Her letters were sterilized 
before they were mailed. 
</P>
<P>
When her ailment was diagnosed as Hansen's disease, the law in Louisiana and 
many other states required that she be sent away to the nation's only place for 
lepers. A boyfriend, the same beau who had written her soulful love letters, 
turned her in to the authorities when the red bumps appeared on her face. Her 
family was ordered to send her away. 
</P>
<P>
"My father wanted to take me away from my brothers and sisters," she said. "All 
the people were already scared to come to our house." 
</P>
<P>
She tells this with a sort of bemusement that has grown, like the callouses on 
her body, over the years. Her hands have been crippled by the disease, her face 
disfigured, her feet numbed. She curls up in an oversized chair in her room, 
wearing outrageous sunglasses and an irrepressible spirit. A radio is in her 
lap, tuned for the next game of her passion, the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my home, whether I like it or not," she says of the Carville facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disease Subdued, Not Extinguished 
</P>
<P>
Leprosy still thrives in the world and lingers in the United States. Medicine 
has learned to subdue, but not extinguish it. Treatment begun early enough can 
arrest the disfigurement that has long been its mark. 
</P>
<P>
So effective is modern treatment that most of the estimated 6,000 lepers in the 
United States are under care of their own doctors or clinics near home. Their 
friends and neighbors probably do not know of their disease, and need not know, 
since there is no danger of catching it. 
</P>
<P>
But the fear remains. "I thought, 'Oh my God, why me? I thought my life was 
over,' " a 40-year-old executive said of his reaction to the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
He went to a doctor when he had trouble straightening the fingers of his left 
hand. Buttoning his shirt was hard; picking up a coffee cup was risky. He could 
not feel pain when hot ashes from his cigarette brushed his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"You have read books and seen pictures, 
</P>
<P>
and you think the worst," he said. "My first concern when I found out is 
whether I am going to pass this along to my family, to my colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
He came to the Hansen's Disease Center for evaluation. Surgery will straighten 
his hand and the drugs will arrest the disease. He has a letter from the 
doctors stating that he poses no danger to others, and he is debating whether 
to give it to his superiors at his company. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be honest with them, but I don't know what they will do." He does 
not want to give his name or identify his employer, a Fortune 500 company. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a history of stigma to this disease," said Sister Francis de 
Sales, one of nine Roman Catholic nuns who serves at the center. She handles 
admission records, and "of the last 10 (new patients), three of them wept 
through the entire admitting procedure." 
</P>
<P>
She was 14, a Wisconsin schoolgirl on a prayer retreat, when she decided to be 
a nun and to help lepers, Sister Frances said. When she first came to Carville 
in 1942, she said, "I thought this was the end. I thought God sent me here, and 
I would never be allowed to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Now 73, she has remained here since, except for seven years spent in Paris by 
her choice. "I've been happy ever since. I think this (work) is like falling in 
love, it's something forceful in you." 
</P>
<P>
She walked a path of courage forged by others in her order, the Daughters of 
Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, based in Emmitsburg, Md. Four of its sisters 
traveled to the isolated sugar cane plantation in 1896 to care for lepers who 
were living in slave shacks. 
</P>
<P>
The lepers had been brought two years earlier from a squalid "pest house" in 
New Orleans after the Daily-Picayune newspaper exposed conditions in the city. 
The state leased the plantation under the pretense of starting an ostrich farm 
and brought to it five men and two women in a coal barge. It was meant as 
humane treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements at Carville were slow in coming. Lepers arriving at the Kalaupapa 
colony on the Hawaiian island of Molokai were thrown onto the beach from boats, 
and Carville was populated by sick people transported under guard, sometimes in 
sealed boxcars. The federal Public Health Service took over the facility in 
1921. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treatable Since 1940s 
</P>
<P>
The sulfone drugs that arrest the disease were developed at Carville in 1941, 
but well into the 1960s, many states still had laws requiring that anyone with 
the disease be sent away to Carville. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, the isolation persists. Neighbors here are the back-alley fixtures 
of society: a state prison, some uncomplaining cows and foul-smelling chemical 
factories. An 8-foot-high chain-link fence rings the premises and there is a 
manned guard post at the front. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the more recent patients are immigrants from Third World countries. 
There are an estimated 12 million cases worldwide. No one is certain how the 
disease spreads, but it is prevalent in Asia, central Africa, India and South 
America where poverty rules and medical care is poor. 
</P>
<P>
Of 191 patients at the center now, 98 are Latino and 35 are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Carville has a worldwide reputation, both for its care and its scientific 
research. Duffy's proposal to dismantle the institution has had and explosive 
impact with the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John R. Trautman, who was director at Carville for 18 years and is now 
chief of international programs, said: "It is not my call to make," but " . . . 
closing this would be disastrous. The rest of the world is looking at this 
facility to help rid themselves of this disease." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissent on Moving 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Hastings, who oversees the labyrinth of research labs and the 270 
armadillos used in testing for the disease, said he believes that moving would 
destroy the "unique thing about this place," the proximity of the research work 
to the patients and those who care for them. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who took over 17 months ago at the appointment of U.S. Surgeon General 
C. Everett Koop, was blunt in his rebuttal. "When I came here I found a 
facility in suspended animation, going nowhere, with no sense of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a staff that hasn't had a bright idea in 50 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy believes that research could better be done on a university campus, and 
patients could be treated more easily in a city. "The swamps by the Mississippi 
are not where to do modern research and treatment of a modern disease," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Younger patients -- there are 31 who are under age 50 -- should be required to 
leave the center and be treated as outpatients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough world out there. You have to make a living and take a job," he 
said. "They are owed treatment for their disease (but) I don't think the 
American people think they are owed a complete life-support system." 
</P>
<P>
The older patients were promised they will be allowed to stay at Carville, 
Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 120 or 130 (patients) who have been put here by the federal 
government. We have taken away their personal support systems, robbed them of 
their identities, put them in a total state of dependency," he said. "They will 
be able to stay here until they die."

PROJECT LOVE WELCOMES 'THE KIDS NOBODY WANTS' -- AIDS VICTIMS AND THE ABUSED 
</P>

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marisa Blay was content keeping house as a wife and mother until she had a 
dream that changed her life. As a result, she became guardian of some of the 
youngest and most-abused victims of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"In my dream, I was in heaven and God told me I was going to hell because he 
had given me so much and I had never helped anybody in return," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The dream inspired Proyecto Amor (Project Love), Puerto Rico's first home for 
newborns and toddlers infected with the AIDS virus who have been beaten, 
neglected or abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the kids nobody wants," Blay said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Jorge, who owns a swimming pool construction company, used 
their savings to found a new charity. They bought an $85,000 house on a 
half-acre lot in the San Juan suburb of Rio Piedras. Local businesses, civic 
groups and individuals donated fresh paint, furniture, clothes and toys. 
</P>
<P>
In July, after months of untangling red tape with public health authorities, 
Blay opened the home with an assistant, eight nurses and two cooks. 
</P>
<P>
The house is a cheery bungalow surrounded by palms and broad-leafed tropical 
plants, with swings, a slide and monkey bars in the back yard. The rooms are 
airy and clean and the closets bulge with little dresses and shirts. New cribs 
are arranged in tidy rows in the three bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my bed," 4-year-old Hilario said proudly, hurrying over to the crib 
where he had left his teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
Hilario, Carmen, 3, and Margarita, 11 months, were the first children brought 
to Proyecto Amor. (Their names were changed at Blay's request.) 
</P>
<P>
The home expects to take in 12 others, including a newborn whose drug-addict 
mother walked away from her in the hospital, in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
The house escaped serious damage from Hurricane Hugo, but the children were 
temporarily moved out when the electricity was knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico, with 3.3 million people, has one of the most serious AIDS 
epidemics in the Western world. Since 1982, 2,940 cases of AIDS have been 
reported, and authorities estimate that 10 times that many people may be 
carrying the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Blay met Carmen on a visit with her church group to a shelter for battered 
children. At the age of 4 months, Carmen had been left home alone with her two 
toddler brothers for about five days. 
</P>
<P>
She was undernourished and had pneumonia and a fungus infection. Blood tests 
were HIV-positive, showing that she is a carrier of the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Police picked up Hilario as a 2-year-old wandering the streets of Old San Juan, 
the capital's historic district. His mother was a chronic drug abuser and he 
was found to be an AIDS carrier. 
</P>
<P>
He was brought to the hospital where Carmen was staying. They shared a room 
there for nearly two years, and now they play together around their new home, 
very much as brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been together so long, they have to be together now," Blay said. 
</P>
<P>
Baby Margarita was born to a drug addict with four other children, and she 
nearly died of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't smile. She didn't cry," Blay said. "When they told us about her, 
they told us she needs a lot of caring, she needs to be held a lot. She had 
never been held." 
</P>
<P>
Proyecto Amor is licensed as a shelter for up to 15 children ranging in age 
from newborn to 7. The Puerto Rico Department of Social Services pays $2,000 a 
month for each child, which covers food, medicine and a $5,000 monthly staff 
payroll, Blay said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blays, who have two young children of their own, retain title to the 
Proyecto Amor property and pay its taxes and utility bills, even though they do 
not live there. Blay said they plan to add rooms, if necessary, and do not want 
to give up ownership for fear that it might become too much like an 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it to work as a home, full of love for these kids, as long as they 
last," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hilario, Carmen and Margarita all appear healthy now, but medical statistics 
are stacked against them. Blay said she is trying to prepare herself 
emotionally for their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that they have a sickness that will one day bring their lives to an 
end," she said, "but I have faith they are going to last a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"The little boy and the little girl have told me they're going to run this 
house when they grow up."

VOLUME OF CO2 CAUSED BY FOREST LOSS POSES A PUZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. COWEN, Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists trying to understand Earth's greenhouse warming are struggling with 
a basic frustration. They are convinced that heavy loss of forests is adding 
heat-trapping carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to the atmosphere. But they cannot make 
even a ballpark guess at the amount. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics for Earth's forest cover on which they base their calculations are 
turning out to be seriously in error. There is much less CO2 absorbing biomass 
per square meter on average in a forest than standard references report. This 
throws assessments of the climatic impact of deforestation -- and, conversely, 
of the beneficial climatic effect of reforestation -- into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Research by Daniel Botkin and Lloyd Simpson at UC Santa Barbara and by Sandra 
Brown at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, shows that widely used 
estimates of forest biomass overstate Earth's inventory by 100% to 300%. The 
message, Brown said, is "Forget all those (old biomass) numbers. They're just 
not valid anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Berrien Moore III at the University of New Hampshire's Complex Systems Research 
Center calls this "one of the most frustrating things" for scientists trying to 
understand global climate change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CO2 Produced by Decay 
</P>
<P>
A growing tree takes CO2 out of the air and locks up the carbon in its tissues. 
The tree releases the carbon -- generally as CO2 -- when it dies and decays or 
is burned. This is a key part of Earth's carbon cycle. The burning of fossil 
fuels is the biggest source of new atmospheric CO2. But, with 70,000 to 110,000 
square kilometers of land being deforested and put to other uses each year, 
scientists expect the loss of forest biomass to be a significant secondary CO2 
source, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that even taking account of deforestation along with other known CO2 
sources and allowing for CO2 "sinks" such as removal by the sea, scientists 
have been unable to account fully for atmospheric CO2 concentrations. "It looks 
like we don't understand the carbon cycle," Moore said. The realization that 
scientists have been using the wrong numbers for forest biomass adds to this 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said the numbers result from unwarranted extrapolation of narrowly 
limited surveys to global scales. He and Botkin have studied the northern 
(boreal) forest that stretches from Alaska to Newfoundland. He noted that 
previous estimates of the average biomass of that forest were based on sampling 
done near cities and universities. These are along the southern part of the 
forest where the tree cover is denser so they give an inflated estimate of the 
biomass average. 
</P>
<P>
Botkin and Simpson applied a random-sampling statistical technique developed 
for crop surveys to the entire forest. They came up with a biomass average of 
4.17 kilograms per square kilometer with an uncertainty of 24%. The averages in 
general use are two to three times higher. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has found comparable overestimates for tropical forests. Her latest study 
for southern and Southeast Asia yields a biomass average of about 25 kilograms 
per square kilometer. Standard values are twice as high. "This suggests that 
deforestation is not as significant a source of CO2" as estimates since 1980 
have implied, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that this lays more of the blame for atmospheric CO2 buildup on 
fossil-fuel burning. But it does not justify deforestation. She points out that 
forests are valuable for many things besides their climatic role. These include 
genetic resources, water supply and products other than timber. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Charles Peters of the New York Botanical Garden, Alwyn Gentry of the 
Missouri Botanical Garden and Robert Mendelshon of Yale University published an 
analysis of the value of non-wood forest products last June 29 in Nature. They 
show that, in the Amazon forest, sustained harvest of such products as fruit, 
oils, latex, fibers and medicines can be two to three times more profitable 
than cutting the trees and trying to farm the land. 
</P>
<P>
Botkin and Simpson are extending their research to North American temperate 
forests. Brown is moving ahead with a program to provide estimates of forest 
biomass within each square of a grid of 0.5-degree latitude/longitude squares 
for the entire forested globe. Both scientists emphasize much more research 
will be needed to give climate-change analysts a reliable biomass data base 
with which to work.

<TEXT>
<P>
Just seven years ago, California voters approved a major change in the state's 
criminal law, passing Proposition 8, a broad-ranging anti-crime initiative 
known as the Victims' Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the measure mandated stiffer sentences for repeat 
offenders, allowed a wider use of evidence against criminal defendants and gave 
victims new rights to restitution and to appear at parole and court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, critics of the criminal justice system remain dissatisfied, and 
now they are appealing once again to the electorate -- this time with another 
initiative, the Crime Victims Justice Reform Act, which authorities say could 
result in even more sweeping changes in the legal process. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure are fueled by what they see as unwarranted delay in the 
system that denies swift and sure justice and adds to the burden of victims who 
must testify repeatedly in protracted proceedings. The 18-month preliminary 
hearing in the McMartin preschool child-molestation case and the four-month 
jury selection in the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono are two 
frequently cited examples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widespread Support 
</P>
<P>
At this point, chances appear good the initiative will be approved. Supporters 
said recently that they already have obtained nearly 1 million signatures -- 
almost double the number required for a place on the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, up to now most of the debate on the measure has been focused on a 
provision opponents say would weaken the right to abortion -- an allegation 
staunchly denied by backers. But that controversy has obscured the much wider 
impact the measure could have on California criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, the initiative would require that state courts follow federal 
rulings in determining criminal procedural rights. State judges would be 
allowed to grant defendants no greater protections than the generally 
less-expansive rights mandated by the U.S. Supreme Court under the federal 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the death penalty would be expanded to cover more types of killings, and 
juveniles 16 or 17 who commit murder would be subject to life in prison without 
parole. Pretrial proceedings, including jury selection, would be sharply 
revised in an attempt to speed the process. And several new procedures would be 
adopted to ease the burdens of crime victims, allowing them to appear less 
often in court. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is strong debate over the merits of the measure, there is little 
doubt that it will result in profound change if enacted -- most fundamentally 
in its broad new deference to more-restrictive federal standards on defendants' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the California Supreme Court was at the forefront of a movement 
to expand rights of individuals beyond federal requirements. But under the 
initiative, perhaps a dozen state high court rulings would be overturned or 
substantially limited, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Issue Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Cutting back on the constitutional rights of those accused of crime may or may 
not be a good idea -- but that ought not to be the only issue," said Jesse H. 
Choper, dean of the Boalt Hall law school at UC Berkeley. "We also should be 
looking at the question of whether California should be able to go its own way, 
with an independent state judiciary, or be bound by the rulings that emanate 
from the U.S. Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
Backers say that despite Proposition 8 and a dramatically realigned state high 
court that has upheld dozens of death sentences in recent months, the new 
initiative is needed to finish the job of reforming the system. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, they say, the previous court under Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth 
Bird used the state Constitution to fashion radical and unwarranted protections 
for defendants -- and the Legislature did little about it. Although the new 
court has overturned or limited some of those rulings, its traditional respect 
for judicial precedent has stymied further change, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
"The chief aim of the initiative is to bring California's criminal justice 
system back into the American mainstream," Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels, 
chairman of the Crime Victims' California Justice Committee, said in an 
interview. "We took what we considered were the best aspects of the federal 
system and the law in other states and wrote them into our measure." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, led by defense attorneys, contend that the initiative would prove 
burdensome on the courts, costly to the taxpayers and unfair to criminal 
defendants. The measure, they say, is merely a grab bag of proposals the 
Legislature would not accept. If it is enacted, opponents add, it will be 
subject to widespread constitutional challenges in the courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rothschild of Sacramento, vice president of California Attorneys for 
Criminal Justice and leader of a new group opposing the initiative, calls the 
measure "most repressive" for its elimination of state-guaranteed rights that 
for years have set California apart from the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild believes that oversimplified claims by proponents may mislead voters 
into passing an exceedingly complicated measure they know little about. 
</P>
<P>
"People are basically intelligent but there are some very detailed, very 
complex parts of this initiative that cannot be described in 30-second sound 
bites," said Rothschild. "If the Legislature, which is basically conservative 
and certainly not pro-defendant, has rejected these things for the past five 
years, that ought to tell us something. . . . If this thing passes, I fear for 
the people, as well as the system." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative contains dozens of provisions, but the following emerge as its 
most important in scope. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
This section would limit defendants' rights to those afforded by the federal 
Constitution in a broad field of law. In all, 12 separate rights are involved, 
ranging from equal protection, due process and assistance of counsel to 
guarantees against unreasonable searches and cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a number of state high court rulings establishing more expansive 
rights would be cast aside in favor of federal interpretations of the law. 
Analysts say the way would be clear, for example, for the revival of capital 
charges for "especially heinous" murders, a provision struck down by the state 
high court in 1982 as a violation of the state constitutional due-process 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the measure are seriously concerned over what they see as the 
breathtaking scope of this provision. While the 1982 anti-crime initiative 
eased the state's judicially imposed restrictions on the types of evidence that 
can be used against defendants, this measure broadly redefines defendants' 
rights, they say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Here Called Severe 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wholesale giving up of any independent viability of the procedural 
rights under the state Constitution," said Santa Clara University law dean 
Gerald F. Uelmen. "This goes well beyond Proposition 8." 
</P>
<P>
Backers acknowledge the provision represents an unparalleled effort to recast 
criminal law, one that apparently has not been made in the initiative process 
in any other state in recent times. "Other states don't have as severe a 
problem as we do in California," said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H. 
MacKenzie. "We're basically trying to enact what already exists elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Link Raised 
</P>
<P>
The 12 rights limited by this section of the initiative include a defendant's 
right to privacy -- a provision that in itself has set off a politically 
charged debate over its potential effect on the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 
decision in Roe vs. Wade, which recognized a federal right to privacy in 
obtaining an abortion, it would effectively restrict California's 
constitutional right to privacy -- and, with it, the right to abortion. Thus, 
they say, the way could be opened to prosecutions under currently unenforceable 
abortion laws or statutes enacted in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Backers reply, however, that the initiative is clearly aimed at criminal 
defendants and does not seek to criminalize any conduct not already prohibited 
under valid statutes. The privacy provision is meant to cover cases involving 
the surveillance of criminal defendants and is intended to limit a 1982 Bird 
Court decision recognizing a right of jail inmates to privacy in jailhouse 
conversations, initiative supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidates Get Involved 
</P>
<P>
Although the provision amounts to only two words -- "to privacy" -- among 
thousands in the initiative, it has stirred a lively dispute between two 
candidates for governor in 1990, Democratic state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp and Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp says the provision jeopardizes abortion rights and, although he 
favors the initiative generally, he refuses to support it as long as it 
contains that provision. Wilson, a prime backer of the measure, replies that it 
presents no threat to abortion and that there is no need to revise the 
initiative. Now, Van de Kamp says he will place the initiative, without the 
privacy provision, in a measure he plans to put on the November, 1990, ballot 
that would create a "superfund" to fight the drug problem. Thus, if both 
measures were approved, the Van de Kamp version, as the superseding measure, 
would ultimately become the law of the state. 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
<P>
The measure, overturning several state Supreme Court decisions, would prevent 
trial judges from dismissing a capital charge, known as a "special 
circumstance," that has been found by a jury; would expand the death penalty to 
include intentional murder of a witness to prevent testimony in a juvenile 
proceeding; and would widen capital punishment to cover murder committed during 
a kidnaping, train-wrecking, sodomy, oral copulation or rape by instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, adopting a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, also would 
permit the death penalty for an accomplice who is a "major participant" in a 
felony-murder and acts with "reckless indifference" to human life. Up to now, 
the state high court has barred the death penalty for an aider and abettor 
without proof of intent to kill. 
</P>
<P>
JUVENILE KILLERS 
</P>
<P>
Although not permitting the death penalty in such crimes, the measure would 
allow sentences of life without parole for 16- or 17-year-olds who commit 
murders for which adults could face execution. 
</P>
<P>
TORTURE 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would establish the crime of torture, punishable by life in 
prison. The provision is a response to the controversy over the case of 
Lawrence Singleton, who was paroled after serving only eight years -- the 
maximum sentence for mayhem -- for using an ax to sever the forearms of his 
15-year-old female victim. 
</P>
<P>
PRETRIAL EVIDENCE 
</P>
<P>
The measure would revise a courtroom rule by which the prosecution must reveal 
its evidence to the defense before trial but the defense need reveal little of 
its case. Under the initiative, the prosecution would be able to learn the 
names and addresses of defense witnesses sooner -- enabling prosecutors to 
better investigate alibis -- and to receive written statements made by 
witnesses to defense investigators and physical, scientific and psychiatric 
evidence the defendant intends to offer at trial. 
</P>
<P>
PRETRIAL DEADLINES 
</P>
<P>
Judges would be required to set a trial date within 60 days of a defendant's 
arraignment, unless there were good cause not to do so. In addition, to be 
assigned to a case, public defenders and court-appointed private counsel would 
be required to attest that they would be prepared to proceed on the date set 
for a preliminary hearing or trial. If they failed to be prepared, without good 
cause, they could be removed from the case, found in contempt, fined or denied 
public-funded compensation. In complicated cases, additional time would be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
GRAND JURY INDICTMENTS, PRELIMINARY HEARINGS 
</P>
<P>
The measure would overturn a landmark 1978 decision by the state Supreme Court 
that gave those defendants indicted by a grand jury a new right to a 
post-indictment preliminary hearing. In such hearings, defendants are generally 
much better able to challenge the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also makes major changes in the preliminary-hearing process 
itself -- the process used in the hundreds of thousands of cases in California 
in which defendants are charged directly by prosecutors, rather than through 
grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would eliminate the current requirement that victims and other 
witnesses appear at preliminary hearings where they can be cross-examined by 
defense counsel. Instead of having witnesses themselves testify at preliminary 
hearings, investigating officers would be allowed to present hearsay testimony 
on what they were told by the witnesses. This revised process would greatly 
speed proceedings and ease the burdens on witnesses, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
JURY SELECTION 
</P>
<P>
In another attempt to speed the process by following the federal system, the 
initiative would direct judges to take the lead role in questioning prospective 
jurors -- a task that now is largely in the hands of attorneys and, in some 
instances, has taken weeks or even months. The measure also limits the scope of 
such interrogations and abandons a 1980 state Supreme Court decision requiring 
that jurors in capital cases be questioned separately and apart from others -- 
another time-consuming process. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, there is considerable disagreement over whether the measure 
would help -- or harm -- the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure say that the proposed new procedures not only would 
speed the process but also would ease the burdens on victims and other 
witnesses who spend agonizing months and years awaiting the end of a case. The 
1982 initiative gave victims the right to restitution and to attend parole and 
court hearings, but they still are called upon for repeated appearances on the 
witness stand, forcing them to lose additional time from work and endure other 
personal pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles prosecutor MacKenzie notes, for example, that in a recent complex 
probate fraud case, witnesses were required to testify first before a grand 
jury, then at a preliminary hearing and finally -- four years after the case 
began -- at trial. "In every federal court in the nation and in 47 states, you 
can go first to the grand jury and then right to trial . . . but not in 
California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings Called Mini-Trials 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie cites also the unusual length of some preliminary hearings -- 
proceedings that too often become full-dress "mini-trials." He notes that the 
hearing in one recent insurance fraud case in Los Angeles took eight months. 
"It's absurd," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Rothschild contends that stricter deadlines and other 
limits on pretrial proceedings place unfair pressures on lawyers and 
defendants. Lengthy preliminary hearings, he argues, are actually an exception 
to the rule. "You can always find a horror story like the McMartin case or the 
Hillside Strangler case, but those are a rarity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And in any event, he said, they provide defendants with a rightful opportunity 
to challenge erroneous identifications and other faulty evidence that could 
result in wrongful conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we have a preliminary hearing," he said. "That's what makes us 
different from the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Court Burden Seen 
</P>
<P>
Law dean Uelmen predicts the limits on preliminary hearings actually would 
result in greater burdens on the court system. At present, he notes, defendants 
get a full opportunity to test the prosecution's case at such proceedings -- 
and more than 90% of the time elect to plead guilty without going to trial. By 
contrast, in the federal system, where hearings are limited, only 75% plead 
guilty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen contends that if California alters its system to follow the federal 
system, it will need to conduct five times as many trials -- which in turn 
would require five times as many courtrooms, judges, prosecutors and public 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
In response, prosecutor Jagels said he expects the initiative, if successful, 
to result in more pleas of guilty before trial. With a broadened exchange of 
evidence before trial, the defendant's advantage of surprise would be largely 
eliminated, he said. The prosecution will have greatly enhanced ability to 
challenge the defendant's alibi or other contentions -- and more likely result 
in an admission of guilt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With reciprocal (exchange of evidence), we'll be able to prove or disprove a 
defendant's story before trial," said Jagels. "They'll have to tell us what 
they've got . . . just like we have to tell them what we've got."

Just seven years ago, California voters approved a major change in the state's 
criminal law, passing Proposition 8, a broad-ranging anti-crime initiative 
known as the Victims' Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the measure mandated stiffer sentences for repeat

system that denies swift and sure justice and adds to the burden of victims who 
must testify repeatedly in protracted proceedings. The 18-month preliminary 
hearing in the McMartin preschool child-molestation case and the four-month

Also, the death penalty would be expanded to cover more types of killings, and 
juveniles 16 or 17 who commit murder would be subject to life in prison without 
parole. Pretrial proceedings, including jury selection, would be sharply 
revised in an attempt to speed the process. And several new procedures would be

</P>
<P>
The initiative contains dozens of provisions, but the following emerge as its 
most important in scope. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
This section would limit defendants' rights to those afforded by the federal 
Constitution in a broad field of law. In all, 12 separate rights are involved, 
ranging from equal protection, due process and assistance of counsel to 
guarantees against unreasonable searches and cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a number of state high court rulings establishing more expansive 
rights would be cast aside in favor of federal interpretations of the law. 
Analysts say the way would be clear, for example, for the revival of capital 
charges for "especially heinous" murders, a provision struck down by the state 
high court in 1982 as a violation of the state constitutional due-process 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the measure are seriously concerned over what they see as the 
breathtaking scope of this provision. While the 1982 anti-crime initiative 
eased the state's judicially imposed restrictions on the types of evidence that 
can be used against defendants, this measure broadly redefines defendants' 
rights, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wholesale giving up of any independent viability of the procedural

Gerald F. Uelmen. "This goes well beyond Proposition 8." 
</P>
<P>
Backers acknowledge the provision represents an unparalleled effort to recast 
criminal law, one that apparently has not been made in the initiative process 
in any other state in recent times. "Other states don't have as severe a 
problem as we do in California," said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H. 
MacKenzie. "We're basically trying to enact what already exists elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Link Raised 
</P>
<P>
The 12 rights limited by this section of the initiative include a defendant's 
right to privacy -- a provision that in itself has set off a politically 
charged debate over its potential effect on the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 
decision in Roe vs. Wade, which recognized a federal right to privacy in 
obtaining an abortion, it would effectively restrict California's 
constitutional right to privacy -- and, with it, the right to abortion. Thus, 
they say, the way could be opened to prosecutions under currently unenforceable 
abortion laws or statutes enacted in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Backers reply, however, that the initiative is clearly aimed at criminal 
defendants and does not seek to criminalize any conduct not already prohibited 
under valid statutes. The privacy provision is meant to cover cases involving 
the surveillance of criminal defendants and is intended to limit a 1982 Bird 
Court decision recognizing a right of jail inmates to privacy in jailhouse 
conversations, initiative supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Candidates Get Involved 
</P>
<P>
Although the provision amounts to only two words -- "to privacy" -- among 
thousands in the initiative, it has stirred a lively dispute between two 
candidates for governor in 1990, Democratic state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp and Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp says the provision jeopardizes abortion rights and, although he 
favors the initiative generally, he refuses to support it as long as it 
contains that provision. Wilson, a prime backer of the measure, replies that it 
presents no threat to abortion and that there is no need to revise the 
initiative. Now, Van de Kamp says he will place the initiative, without the 
privacy provision, in a measure he plans to put on the November, 1990, ballot 
that would create a "superfund" to fight the drug problem. Thus, if both 
measures were approved, the Van de Kamp version, as the superseding measure, 
would ultimately become the law of the state. 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
<P>
The measure, overturning several state Supreme Court decisions, would prevent 
trial judges from dismissing a capital charge, known as a "special 
circumstance," that has been found by a jury; would expand the death penalty to 
include intentional murder of a witness to prevent testimony in a juvenile 
proceeding; and would widen capital punishment to cover murder committed during 
a kidnaping, train-wrecking, sodomy, oral copulation or rape by instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, adopting a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, also would 
permit the death penalty for an accomplice who is a "major participant" in a 
felony-murder and acts with "reckless indifference" to human life. Up to now, 
the state high court has barred the death penalty for an aider and abettor 
without proof of intent to kill. 
</P>
<P>
JUVENILE KILLERS 
</P>
<P>
Although not permitting the death penalty in such crimes, the measure would 
allow sentences of life without parole for 16- or 17-year-olds who commit 
murders for which adults could face execution. 
</P>
<P>
TORTURE 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would establish the crime of torture, punishable by life in 
prison. The provision is a response to the controversy over the case of 
Lawrence Singleton, who was paroled after serving only eight years -- the 
maximum sentence for mayhem -- for using an ax to sever the forearms of his 
15-year-old female victim. 
</P>
<P>
PRETRIAL EVIDENCE 
</P>
<P>
The measure would revise a courtroom rule by which the prosecution must reveal 
its evidence to the defense before trial but the defense need reveal little of 
its case. Under the initiative, the prosecution would be able to learn the 
names and addresses of defense witnesses sooner -- enabling prosecutors to 
better investigate alibis -- and to receive written statements made by 
witnesses to defense investigators and physical, scientific and psychiatric 
evidence the defendant intends to offer at trial. 
</P>
<P>
PRETRIAL DEADLINES 
</P>
<P>
Judges would be required to set a trial date within 60 days of a defendant's 
arraignment, unless there were good cause not to do so. In addition, to be 
assigned to a case, public defenders and court-appointed private counsel would 
be required to attest that they would be prepared to proceed on the date set 
for a preliminary hearing or trial. If they failed to be prepared, without good 
cause, they could be removed from the case, found in contempt, fined or denied 
public-funded compensation. In complicated cases, additional time would be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
GRAND JURY INDICTMENTS, PRELIMINARY HEARINGS 
</P>
<P>
The measure would overturn a landmark 1978 decision by the state Supreme Court 
that gave those defendants indicted by a grand jury a new right to a 
post-indictment preliminary hearing. In such hearings, defendants are generally 
much better able to challenge the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also makes major changes in the preliminary-hearing process 
itself -- the process used in the hundreds of thousands of cases in California 
in which defendants are charged directly by prosecutors, rather than through 
grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would eliminate the current requirement that victims and other 
witnesses appear at preliminary hearings where they can be cross-examined by 
defense counsel. Instead of having witnesses themselves testify at preliminary 
hearings, investigating officers would be allowed to present hearsay testimony 
on what they were told by the witnesses. This revised process would greatly 
speed proceedings and ease the burdens on witnesses, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
JURY SELECTION 
</P>
<P>
In another attempt to speed the process by following the federal system, the 
initiative would direct judges to take the lead role in questioning prospective 
jurors -- a task that now is largely in the hands of attorneys and, in some 
instances, has taken weeks or even months. The measure also limits the scope of 
such interrogations and abandons a 1980 state Supreme Court decision requiring 
that jurors in capital cases be questioned separately and apart from others -- 
another time-consuming process. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, there is considerable disagreement over whether the measure 
would help -- or harm -- the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure say that the proposed new procedures not only would 
speed the process but also would ease the burdens on victims and other 
witnesses who spend agonizing months and years awaiting the end of a case. The 
1982 initiative gave victims the right to restitution and to attend parole and 
court hearings, but they still are called upon for repeated appearances on the 
witness stand, forcing them to lose additional time from work and endure other 
personal pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles prosecutor MacKenzie notes, for example, that in a recent complex 
probate fraud case, witnesses were required to testify first before a grand 
jury, then at a preliminary hearing and finally -- four years after the case 
began -- at trial. "In every federal court in the nation and in 47 states, you 
can go first to the grand jury and then right to trial . . . but not in 
California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie cites also the unusual length of some preliminary hearings -- 
proceedings that too often become full-dress "mini-trials." He notes that the 
hearing in one recent insurance fraud case in Los Angeles took eight months. 
"It's absurd," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Rothschild contends that stricter deadlines and other 
limits on pretrial proceedings place unfair pressures on lawyers and 
defendants. Lengthy preliminary hearings, he argues, are actually an exception 
to the rule. "You can always find a horror story like the McMartin case or the 
Hillside Strangler case, but those are a rarity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And in any event, he said, they provide defendants with a rightful opportunity 
to challenge erroneous identifications and other faulty evidence that could 
result in wrongful conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we have a preliminary hearing," he said. "That's what makes us 
different from the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Court Burden Seen 
</P>
<P>
Law dean Uelmen predicts the limits on preliminary hearings actually would 
result in greater burdens on the court system. At present, he notes, defendants 
get a full opportunity to test the prosecution's case at such proceedings -- 
and more than 90% of the time elect to plead guilty without going to trial. By 
contrast, in the federal system, where hearings are limited, only 75% plead 
guilty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen contends that if California alters its system to follow the federal 
system, it will need to conduct five times as many trials -- which in turn 
would require five times as many courtrooms, judges, prosecutors and public 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
In response, prosecutor Jagels said he expects the initiative, if successful, 
to result in more pleas of guilty before trial. With a broadened exchange of 
evidence before trial, the defendant's advantage of surprise would be largely 
eliminated, he said. The prosecution will have greatly enhanced ability to 
challenge the defendant's alibi or other contentions -- and more likely result 
in an admission of guilt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With reciprocal (exchange of evidence), we'll be able to prove or disprove a 
defendant's story before trial," said Jagels. "They'll have to tell us what 
they've got . . . just like we have to tell them what we've got."

CONGRESS OKS CONTENT CURBS ON ARTS FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
BUT MEASURE DOES NOT ENTIRELY BAR MONEY FOR SHOCKING OR SACRILEGIOUS WORKS 
</P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate approved and sent to President Bush on Saturday a bill that for the 
first time imposes content restrictions on federally funded art, but it does 
not completely rule out funding of shocking or sacrilegious works. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which cleared the Senate by a vote of 91 to 6, represented a 
victory for arts community leaders in their long-running struggle with 
conservatives over what criteria the federal government should use in funding 
art, music, literature and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to sign the bill, which also provides funds for the Interior 
Department and contains provisions to protect an endangered owl, restrict 
government lobbyists and limit preliminary oil leasing activity off the coast 
of California. 
</P>

<P>
Helms' Bid Rejected 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 62 to 35, the Senate rejected a last-ditch effort by Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) to set stricter limitations on the prerogatives of the National 
Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund 
lewd or sacrilegious works. It was the third time in a week that the Senate had 
defeated Helms on what has become a hotly debated free speech issue. 
</P>
<P>
And even though Helms acknowledged he had been foiled by the intense lobbying 
of what he disdainfully called "the arts crowd," he and like-minded senators 
did not give up easily. 
</P>
<P>
As senators filed into the chamber to vote, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), a Helms 
ally, positioned himself at the door with some of the federally funded 
black-and-white photographs that provoked the uproar: Andres Serrano's 
depiction of a cross in a bottle of urine and Robert Mapplethorpe's photos of 
homosexual acts and sexual conduct by children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Judgment 
</P>
<P>
The legislation states that no federal funds should be spent "to promote, 
disseminate or produce materials which in the judgment of the National 
Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities may be 
considered obscene, including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism, 
homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in 
sex acts and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, 
artistic, political or scientific value." 
</P>
<P>
While many senators portrayed it as a fair compromise between conservatives and 
the arts community, Helms said the language contains an enormous loophole -- 
"so big you could drive 12 Mack trucks through it" -- that allows endowment 
officials to determine what kind of art violates the statute. He said the 
loophole was unacceptable to him since officials involved in funding Serrano 
and Mapplethorpe refuse to acknowledge making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing More Than a Sop' 
</P>
<P>
"It would prohibit nothing, absolutely nothing," Helms declared. "It was 
nothing more than a sop to fool the American people into thinking that the 
liberal majority in Congress was actively willing to do something to stop 
federal funding of obscene material . . . . Any yo-yo can get himself a glass 
jar and fill it with urine and he can stick a crucifix in it and get $5,000, as 
one did whose name is Andres Serrano." 
</P>
<P>
Helms noted that Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.), who was instrumental in 
weakening proposed restrictions on NEA during negotiations between the House 
and Senate, had recently received a standing ovation at an arts community event 
for his success in defeating Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many arts community leaders embraced the compromise, even though some 
legal experts question whether it is constitutional and gay activists fear it 
might prompt a backlash against all art dealing with homosexual subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, who met last week with incoming NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, said he 
was convinced that the newly appointed endowment chief would not fund anything 
objectionable to Congress. But he said he could not trust that Frohnmayer's 
successors would take the same attitude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wording of Helms' Provision 
</P>
<P>
The substitute provision proposed by Helms and rejected by the Senate would 
have outlawed the expenditure of federal funds "to promote, disseminate or 
produce materials that are obscene or that depict or describe in a patently 
offensive way, sexual or excretory activities or organs, including but not 
limited to obscene depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sexual intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
Helms said his language was based on Supreme Court definitions of what 
constitutes obscenity and thus gave the NEA no discretion in interpreting the 
law. Opponents said it would be impractical to take the decision out of the 
hands of the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has frequently been debated as a First Amendment issue, most 
senators accepted Helms' argument that the refusal of the government to fund 
offensive artworks does nothing to abridge the free expression of artists, who 
still can produce these works with private funds. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the new restrictions represented the 
first step in a campaign by conservative "know-nothings" to abolish federal 
support for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sets Up Panel 
</P>
<P>
The legislation establishes a 12-member commission to review the standards and 
grant-making procedures of the endowments. It also requires the endowments to 
notify Congress before making any grants to the Southeastern Center for 
Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Institute for Contemporary Art 
at the University of Pennsylvania, both of which presented controversial art 
shows last year. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction within the arts community to the Senate vote was cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it is over," said Frohnmayer, the Portland, Ore., lawyer who takes over 
Tuesday as the national endowment's new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Helms abandons his efforts to win legislative approval of more 
restrictive directives, Frohnmayer said the Senate vote does not signal a final 
resolution of the controversy over the content of federally funded art. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously something we're going to have to deal with over the coming 
years," he said. "I also hope, as I have told Sen. Helms, that what this really 
boils down to in the end is judgment of those who are in charge of the NEA. I 
now would hope that they would give me an opportunity to exercise that 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future of Spotted Owl 
</P>
<P>
Although the limitation on arts funding dominated debate over the Interior 
Department funding bill, it was by no means the only important provision in the 
legislation. The measure also affects the future of the endangered spotted owl, 
sets restrictions on lobbyists seeking money from the federal government and 
calls for a presidential task force to look into the environmental concerns 
involved in oil and gas drilling off the coast of California. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) said the bill's provisions governing timberland 
inhabited by the spotted owl reflect a 50-50 compromise that does not fully 
satisfy either environmentalists or timber interests, which claim that court 
orders protecting wildlife habitats are destroying their industry. 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose when the Senate voted to free timber sales in Washington and 
Oregon from court-ordered bans on logging. Under the compromise, Congress 
agreed to reduce the allowable level of timber sales somewhat and require 
environmentalists to chose which of the timber sales now blocked by the courts 
will be allowed to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied to HUD Scandal 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying restrictions were authored originally by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. 
Va.) in response to the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. They will require detailed reports to be filed by lobbyists and 
prohibit recipients of federal grants from using tax dollars to finance their 
lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The provisions governing offshore drilling grew out of an effort by the House 
to place a moratorium on all activity leading up to the leasing of oil and gas 
tracts off the California coast. The compromise stipulates that no draft 
environmental impact statement on the proposed leasing can be issued until five 
months after a presidential task force releases the results of an inquiry into 
what effect drilling would have on the environment.

MOCK TRIBUNAL SEEKS TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON GUATEMALA ABUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a mock tribunal, a staged courtroom drama designed to bring justice to a 
world that has none. 
</P>
<P>
But the tears the witnesses shed were real, as was the litany of horrors 
presented to the 150 people who gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to 
listen to tales of torture, murder and kidnaping that have become part of daily 
life in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
There was Nineth de Garcia, telling of the day in 1984 her husband was kidnaped 
by military police and dragged off to a secret prison. He was a trade union 
activist the government accused of being a communist. He has not been seen 
since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son Arrested 
</P>
<P>
And there was Margarita Garcia, whose son, Raul, was arrested by military 
police seven years ago while attending classes at a university. Like de 
Garcia's husband, he has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, dozens of others victims have been found: shot, stabbed and 
mutilated. The recent upsurge in violence against civilians prompted some of 
Guatemala's leading human rights activists to travel to Los Angeles last week 
to seek support for their efforts to end the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to raise the consciousness of the American people to the pain and 
suffering being felt by the Guatemalan people," de Garcia said during a break 
in the mock tribunal. "We've tried everything else, and nothing has worked." 
</P>
<P>
De Garcia is president of Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo, a human rights group she 
co-founded with four other women she met during the search for her husband. She 
said the women kept running into each other at morgues, prisons, churches and 
hospitals, so they decided to organize to streamline their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the group has about 2,500 members, all of whom have had a relative 
killed, tortured, imprisoned or "disappeared." The group was one of several 
represented at the mock tribunal, one of a series of political and cultural 
events sponsored by the Voices of Justice and Solidarity for Guatemala and the 
Guatemala Information Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We demand a stop to the oppression and a return of our civil and human 
rights," said Marvin Perez, one of several speakers who said they had been 
kidnaped and beaten by the military police. Perez and others condemned 
Guatemala's civilian president, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, for doing little to 
halt the upsurge in violence and blasted the U.S. government for its "attitude 
of indifference" toward the plight of Guatemalans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been harassed and threated for the past five years, ever since they took 
my husband," said de Garcia. "But even though we are worried about what will 
happen to us when we return home, we felt it was necessary to come here and let 
people know what is happening."

JERUSALEM ROAD PROJECT RUNS INTO PAST, TURNS INTO DIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 16 years of haggling, a license was granted for widening a road next to 
the wall of Jerusalem's Old City. But work was halted days later when a 
bulldozer uncovered a Byzantine bathhouse no one knew existed. 
</P>
<P>
It's a typical hazard for developers in Jerusalem, a city that dates back about 
3,500 years and where a shovel put in the ground almost anywhere can turn up 
archeological artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an overload of history here," said Aharon Meir, a city archeologist. 
"That's what makes Jerusalem different. If you don't bother to check, you can 
simply bulldoze important findings away." 
</P>
<P>
Meir supervises the archeological dig launched where construction crews have 
temporarily ceased building a 820-foot stretch of the new Mamilla Road. 
</P>
<P>
The finds so far indicate that contrary to earlier belief, the roughly 
square-mile walled city may have once extended beyond the current walls, Meir 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new road runs near the Old City's Jaffa Gate, built by the Turkish ruler 
Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th Century. Although long considered a 
possible archeological site, the area was never excavated by researchers. 
</P>
<P>
For years, it was off-limits as a battlefield or cease-fire zone between 
Israeli and Arab armies. After Israel captured it and the rest of east 
Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, other sections of the city 
were given priority by archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
One example was "King David's City," near the holy Al Aqsa Mosque, and the 
Wailing Wall remnant of the ancient Jewish temples. 
</P>
<P>
At the Jaffa Gate, excavators have dug more than 2,000 years into the past, 
stopping when they hit bedrock that indicated they had found the earliest 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Two structures so far uncovered -- a bathhouse and a large public building yet 
to be identified -- have been tentatively dated from the Byzantine period of 
the Roman Empire, or about the 4th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Also discovered by Meir, helped by several dozen Palestinian laborers, is an 
intricate web of water cisterns, apparently part of an aqueduct system that 
supplied the ancient city's water. 
</P>
<P>
"These may not look like stupendous finds, but they provide little important 
tidbits of information about what life was like. If we give up these little 
things, we would miss the larger picture," Meir said. 
</P>
<P>
Meir said the planned road will likely be completed eventually, but the section 
adjacent to the dig may have to be diverted or lifted onto an overpass that 
would allow tourists to see the ancient ruins underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Under a city ordinance, contractors must sponsor an archeological survey of any 
building site if historical relics are found during construction. Usually, a 
compromise is worked out so building can continue. 
</P>
<P>
The new road is part of a $250-million project to build a hotel, apartment 
buildings and a shopping plaza in Mamilla, a predominantly Arab quarter before 
Israel's 1948 independence war. 
</P>
<P>
Several plans for developing Mamilla have been shelved since 1973 amid huge 
disputes between planners and environmentalists. Among other complaints, the 
environmentalists expressed fears the new road could increase pollution, 
causing damage to old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the current project, a compromise was struck in which the planned road was 
narrowed from six to three lanes and several old structures were spared being 
leveled. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Karta Company, developers of Mamilla, said they hope the 
latest delay will not last beyond the end of the month so they can meet their 
building schedule. But they take it philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
The latest complication in the Mamilla plan is typical of what most building 
projects in Jerusalem have faced in the last two decades, ranging from housing 
developments in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City to the Hebrew University 
campus on Mt. Scopus. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, preparations for a shopping mall were halted when excavators found 
two prehistoric farming villages from the Bronze Age at the city's southern 
outskirts. A compromise to allow building of the mall is reportedly being 
worked out.

POLES FIND INGENIOUS WAYS TO COMBAT INFLATION

They had to stand in line for four days and then pay out the equivalent of more 
than one year's average wages apiece. In return, they received only the promise 
that sometime in the next four years, each will each have the chance to buy an 
unfinished wooden house for the going price at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Zbigniew Murawski, 22, and fiancee Marlena Zadruska, 24, count 
themselves among the lucky ones in a story that illustrates the economic chaos 
that challenges Poland's Solidarity-led government and the kind of initiative 
that the new leaders hope will help heal the ravages of more than 40 years of 
Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were among almost 4,000 Warsaw residents who responded last month 
when a new Polish firm, Drewbud Bank SA, advertised "an offer like there's 
never been -- a house for you." Scores of police had to be called to control 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, only 300 were able to buy one of the limited number of so-called 
"housing bonds" that Drewbud offered for sale here and in 10 other Polish 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
A Drewbud official said that the firm will spend the proceeds of the bond sale 
to re-equip half a dozen factories, some of which were on the verge of 
bankruptcy. Then it will start to produce its prefabricated homes for assembly 
on the bond-holders' lots. Buyers will also have to supply their own plumbing 
and utility connections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nobody Is Sure' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gamble," conceded Zadruska, who said their bonds used up all of hers 
and Murawski's savings as well as a loan from her parents. "It's the first 
initiative like this. Everybody hopes it will come out OK. But nobody is sure." 
</P>
<P>
The first houses, to be completed next summer, are expected to cost at least 10 
times the price of the bond, and the land could be more expensive still. She 
and her fiance don't know where the rest of the money will come from, said 
Zadruska, a music student, but "this is our only chance to get a house. We 
would have to wait more than 20 years to get a (state) apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Houses aren't the only thing that Poles are scrambling to buy. Almost anything, 
it seems, is more attractive than holding onto their zlotys in the face of 
rapidly accelerating inflation -- even lottery tickets, according to some. 
</P>
<P>
Prices, which increased here by 25% in 1987, leaped 61% last year. They went up 
another 84% in the first seven months of this year and are expected to rise 90% 
more long before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"If this trend continued, we would have inflation amounting to 4,000% a year 
from today, and there is no guarantee that monthly price movements will not 
exceed those we have seen so far," declared Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland's new 
prime minister, in an address to Parliament last month 
</P>
<P>

Licensed Exchange Shops 
</P>
<P>
Dollars and other Western currencies represent a haven for some Poles, since 
their value relative to the zloty generally increases at a rate equal to or 
faster than the rate of inflation. Licensed exchange shops have sprouted like 
mushrooms since earlier this year, when it became legal to trade in foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The realities of spiraling inflation, chronic shortages of domestically 
produced goods, and the distortions that accompany a flourishing foreign 
currency market have combined to turn the most respectable Poles into 
moonlighters, black marketeers, money changers and fast-buck artists. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask where people get their money -- well, this is one of the ways," a 
middle-aged office worker said, gesturing toward a line of at least 150 people 
outside a bookstore that had just received a shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"You get lucky and happen by a store when it has something interesting," the 
man explained. "You stand in line for two hours, but for say, 10,000 zlotys (at 
state-controlled prices) you walk away with something valuable. You take it 
across the river and sell it at the flea market for 30,000. Then you stop into 
the currency exchange on the way home and immediately change it into dollars. 
You've had a good day!" 
</P>
<P>
In a passage of his speech to Parliament that many Poles found particularly 
poignant, Mazowiecki commented, "We want to live in a country with a sound 
economy, where it pays to work and save, and where satisfying basic material 
needs is not associated with torment and humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
Poland has become like a giant Middle Eastern bazaar. Streets and sidewalks 
around the center of the capital are cluttered with people doing business from 
makeshift stands or the backs of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
At the Centrum department store, long lines of customers recently were snapping 
up a shipment of Austrian panty hose. How did the price compare to Polish hose? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen (the latter) for a long time, so I don't remember," replied a 
woman shopper with an embarrassed smile. 
</P>
<P>
One man filled a duffel bag with his purchases, which will no doubt appear soon 
at one of the major flea markets in Warsaw or some other city. 
</P>
<P>
Lines are so common these days that various departments in Centrum and other 
stores have arrows pointing out "the direction of queuing." 
</P>
<P>
An exception is Centrum's top floor, which houses one of a chain of 
state-operated "Pewex" outlets, selling imported goods for Western currency. 
Compared to the frenzied mood in the regular departments below, the atmosphere 
here is uncrowded and almost elegant. Prices are all quoted in dollars, and a 
shopper with dollars can buy everything from groceries and designer clothing to 
swim fins and video recorders. 
</P>
<P>
A popular Polish joke based on this Western ambience tells of the country 
bumpkin who, upon spotting a Pewex, raced inside and demanded political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
At the central office of the PKO bank, scores of Poles milled around the 
foreign exchange counter. But most seemed to be doing business with the 
unlicensed, private money changers who circulated through the crowd, hand-held 
calculators at the ready. The private changers offered much better rates than 
the bank, but the profit they made on the difference between their buying and 
selling prices was more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
How long will it be before the Polish economy is stabilized? 
</P>
<P>
"It could be several months; it could be several years," one money changer said 
with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mazowiecki, Poland doesn't have several years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger of Collapse 
</P>
<P>
"The new government will act under pressure that at any moment the construction 
of democracy in Poland, just started, could collapse in the face of economic 
breakdown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has begun touring Western capitals in hopes of 
enlisting enough aid to speed up the process of stabilization and ease the 
inevitable pain of reform. He is due to visit the United States later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But the new government has also indicated that its economic program will 
include measures to create a real domestic capital market, including approaches 
such as Drewbud's housing bonds, which effectively draws on cash in people's 
hands to finance economic expansion, while reducing the amount of money now 
chasing scarce goods and driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
It is indicative of the government's interest that two of Drewbud's six 
partners are state agencies -- one charged with overseeing structural changes 
in industry and another encouraging technological innovation. The other 
partners are state and private enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Jerzy Rucinski, assistant to Drewbud's chairman, said in a telephone interview 
from company headquarters in Poznan that nationwide, the firm raised 30 billion 
zlotys by selling 15,000 housing bonds at a price of 2 million zlotys each. 
</P>
<P>
That's equal to about $200 for each bond at the prevailing rate of exchange; 
more than $1,500 at the "official" rate charged foreigners at hotels and rental 
car agencies. More importantly, it compares to an average annual salary for a 
factory worker here of about 1.5 million zlotys. 
</P>
<P>
Many consumers bought more than one bond. In Warsaw, one buyer walked off with 
300 of them. He is believed to have represented an enterprise that will offer 
the houses as an incentive for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
Some see the bonds as a good investment, which they'll be able to sell later at 
a profit.

APPALACHIA TOWN HOPES FOR TOURIST LURE IN FAMOUS HATFIELD-MCCOY FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MATEWAN, W. Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hatfields and McCoys don't fight anymore, and many of them would just as 
soon forget their ancestors' feud. But some in the community are trying to find 
a way to commemorate the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of grandsons of Devil Anse (Hatfield) and his brothers around 
here," said Paul McAllister, director of the new Matewan Development Center. 
"Most of them are in their 60s and they're a little bit bitter about the 
reputations they had to grow up with and live with." 
</P>
<P>
The Matewan Development Center, in the only three-story building in the town of 
800, features a photo display on the massacre and other incidents in the town's 
history. It draws a few people a week. McAllister is hoping that the National 
Park Service will help turn Matewan into a tourist attraction. He envisions a 
museum, for instance, within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 100 years had passed since eight Hatfield clan members were 
sentenced to life in prison and a ninth was sentenced to death for slaying five 
McCoys. The sentences ended the bloodshed in which 10 to 20 people died. 
</P>
<P>
But most participants died of old age. The Hatfields' patriarch, William 
Anderson (Devil Anse) Hatfield, got religion and gained community respect 
before he died in 1921 at age 83. His grave at Sarah Ann in Logan County is 
marked by a towering Italian marble sculpture of him. The leader of the McCoys, 
Randolph (Old Ran'l) McCoy, embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 
children, moved to town in Pikeville, Ky., dying in 1910 at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
Buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the heart of 
Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that the Hatfields, living mainly in what is now Mingo County, 
W. Va., and the McCoys, in Pike County, Ky., fought on and off for a dozen 
years in the region's wooded tangle of valleys and ridges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story of Affair 
</P>
<P>
Some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the McCoys and 
ended up in a Hatfield pen. Others say the dispute stemmed from the Civil War, 
in which, this version goes, the Hatfields fought for the Confederacy and the 
McCoys the Union. Others say both families fought for the South. 
</P>
<P>
Romantics say that the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between Johnse 
Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy, and that she eventually bore him a child out of 
wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1988 book "Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in Appalachia, 
1860-1900," author Altina Waller contends that the feud was the result of a 
clash between the traditional culture based on subsistence farming, represented 
by the McCoys, and the emergence of capitalism fueled by coal mining, timber 
cutting and railroad interests in the Hatfields' region. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, open warfare between the families began in 1882 when Devil 
Anse's brother, Ellison Hatfield, was stabbed two dozen times and shot during 
an Election Day brawl in Pike County. The Hatfields seized the three McCoys 
responsible, and when Ellison died they were tied to pawpaw trees and executed. 
</P>
<P>
The feud escalated until New Year's Day, 1888, when the Hatfields attacked the 
McCoy home in Pike County, burning it to the ground and killing two of Old 
Ran'l's children. 
</P>
<P>
Now, McAllister's organization is trying to find a way to commemorate the feud 
and the 1920 Matewan Massacre, a downtown gun battle between United Mine 
Workers sympathizers and coal company guards in which at least nine people 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Robert McCoy, a former Matewan mayor, is among those who had to grow up with 
the stigma attached to the feud, even though his branch of the family had 
economic ties to Devil Anse and never took part in the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
But McCoy also is on the Matewan Development Center's board of directors, whose 
plans call for historic restoration downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the family, I probably get a little tired of it. . . . But as a 
community, I think it's one of our great hopes for economic survival here."

ANCIENT MYTHS AND FEARS PERSIST;

<P>
LEPER LIVES A LIE, TELLS FAMILY IT'S CANCER

She told her family that she has cancer; she would rather they believe the lie. 
She cannot not tell them that she has Hansen's disease -- leprosy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I tell them I have the disease, I don't know how they would act," she said. 
"Suppose they are scared of me? I could not take that. I would be real hurt." 
</P>
<P>
She is 32, a modern example of the ancient myth and fear that persist about 
this disease. Call her Li. Now under treatment, she cannot transmit the disease 
to others. Her only disability is the thick, calloused skin on her face and 
ears. She is awaiting surgery that will lessen the scars. 
</P>
<P>
This rough skin is at once outshone by her lively, dark eyes and a rebounding 
cheer that seems to belie her fear. 
</P>
<P>
Li is Cambodian, and memories of the outcast lepers in her homeland frighten 
her still. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say the word" for the disease in her native Khmer language, 
she explains with a sudden nervousness. She will not say the Khmer word for a 
reporter. "When I say I have this disease, I always talk in English. It scares 
me. I cannot stand the word." 
</P>
<P>
Li's is typical of the approximately 300 cases of Hansen's disease diagnosed 
annually in the United States. Most of the patients are immigrants who may have 
unknowingly harbored the bacteria for as long as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Li twice fled into Thailand before coming to California in 1981. A year later 
she noticed small, itchy bumps on her face. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when the disease started. They sent me to three doctors before 
they found out what it was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried and cried and cried and cried. I could not stop. I thought, 'Oh my 
God, my life is finished.' I didn't want my family to know. I went to the 
doctor myself." 
</P>
<P>
She began drug therapy, but when a reaction to the medication worsened her 
condition, she came to the Hansen's Disease Center. That was seven years ago. 
She remains here, having made a life within the old white buildings and the 
maze of covered corridors that offer shade in the Louisiana heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it in here. In here, it is safe because everyone is the same." Outside, 
she said, "people are staring at you, and ask you all the questions. You don't 
know what to answer. You really feel bad. You make up stories." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to stay here forever. You have no future in here," she 
acknowledged. "But in here, well, it is safe."

ARMY BARS ISRAEL PEACE ACTIVISTS' WEST BANK CONVOY

The army set up a road block of jeeps and barbed wire Saturday to prevent a 
"peace convoy" of more than 1,000 Israelis from entering the West Bank town of 
Tulkarm to hold talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"This obstacle, this roadblock, it is symbolic, and there are many obstacles 
that the Israeli government tries to put up between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians," said Faisal Husseini, a prominent East Jerusalem Palestinian who 
was part of the convoy. 
</P>
<P>
The military had declared Tulkarm a closed military area and erected the 
roadblocks after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the "Peace Day" visit 
to the West Bank town canceled. Peace activists said the military had no 
authority to stop the event because it was not planned as a demonstration but 
as a series of visits to Palestinian homes. 
</P>
<P>
Blocked from entering Tulkarm, the protesters filled the road at the western 
entrance to the town and unfurled banners reading "Peace Now." 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing Knesset members Haim Oron and Dedi Zucker criticized Israel's "Inner 
Cabinet" for rejecting Friday an Egyptian invitation to begin 
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.

PARTY'S HOLD ON STATE THREATENED; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGIOUS WARFARE SPLITS ARIZONA REPUBLICANS

<P>
The mixture of religion and politics has always made for a heady brew. But 
Republicans in Arizona have had so much of that blend this year that they are 
suffering from a statewide hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The state party has been plagued for months by struggles that have more to do 
with the pulpit than the precinct hall. The intra-party squabbles have pitted 
Christians against Jews, Christians against Christians, fundamentalist 
Christians against Mormons and Mormons against Mormons -- while Democrats and 
neutral observers look on in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is sad for us," said Kit Mehrtens, the state's Republican national 
committeewoman. "People who might like to join the Republican Party are turned 
off by its image. I don't feel that the people of Arizona go along with this 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Seen as Weakened 
</P>
<P>
One thing just about every Republican here can agree on is that religious 
wrangling in the name of politics has weakened the party at a time when 
changing demographics had been turning Arizona into a Republican stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of the GOP's internecine struggles, no Republican gubernatorial 
candidate seems to have much of a chance in the 1990 election against Gov. Rose 
Mofford, the moderate Democrat who assumed the job when former Gov. Evan Mecham 
was removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' strongest hope in the governor's race, Rep. Jim Kolbe of 
Tucson, has decided to seek reelection instead. 
</P>
<P>
With the morally charged issue of abortion looming larger than ever, the 
relationship between religion and politics may grow tighter in states around 
the country. Arizona's experience offers insight into the potentially explosive 
results of that combination. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP's church-and-state problem stems from a marriage of convenience between 
two segments of the party's conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of Mecham -- a group, known here as the Evanistas, with many Mormons in 
its ranks -- joined forces with fundamentalist Christians who had worked for 
television evangelist Pat Robertson in his 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
This faction became a highly visible element at party gatherings; some 
delegates prayed in tongues on the floor of the state convention this year. 
Gradually, religious tension increased. One county chairman active in the 
Christian right complained to the news media that Jews have too much control 
over GOP finances, drawing a formal rebuke from the state party's acting 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The Evanista coalition showed its muscle at the convention when it won adoption 
of a resolution in which the Arizona Republican Party formally declared that 
the United States "is a Christian nation . . . a republic based upon the 
absolute laws of the Bible, not a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution grew from a local flap into a national embarrassment when the 
Washington Post reported that Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had 
played a key part in its adoption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter From O'Connor 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, a former GOP activist here, wrote a letter to a leading 
fundamentalist Republican asserting -- incorrectly, as it turned out -- that 
the Supreme Court has issued three rulings "to the effect that this is a 
Christian nation." O'Connor's imprimatur helped assure the adoption of the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The next war of religion started when two Mormon Evanistas expressed outrage at 
an anti-Mecham cartoon in the Arizona Republic, the major daily newspaper in 
Phoenix. They petitioned Mormon headquarters in Salt Lake City, demanding that 
the cartoonist, Steve Benson, be kicked off a Mormon High Council because of 
the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Benson, 35, said he was stunned by that move because he is a devout Mormon and 
a graduate of the church-owned Brigham Young University. He is not just any 
devout Mormon, either; his grandfather is the faith's current prophet, seer and 
revelator, Ezra Taft Benson, 90, who heads the 6-million-member worldwide 
church. 
</P>
<P>
The cheery, talkative Steve Benson's cartoons are tough, razor-edged and 
occasionally offensive to one group or another. On the wall of his impossibly 
cluttered studio here hangs a sign that could serve as a motto for any 
editorial cartoonist: "I don't aim to please -- I just aim." 
</P>
<P>
The Mormon Church removed Benson from his council position, although he still 
is permitted to teach Sunday school at his local ward, or parish. Shortly 
thereafter, 12 prominent leaders of other Christian faiths, representing the 
local Bishops and Executives Round Table, distributed a letter criticizing 
Benson's use of religious symbols in the anti-Mecham cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
That interfaith letter, in turn, sparked counter-criticism from other ministers 
and civic leaders, which served to raise the level of political-religious 
tension one more notch. 
</P>
<P>
The latest development on the church-state front involves the apparent breakup 
of the Mormon-fundamentalist GOP coalition. Soon after Mecham announced plans 
to run again for governor next year, a prominent leader of the Republican 
fundamentalists, Annetta Conant, declared that she could not support him. 
</P>
<P>
"It has only to do with religious philosophy," she said. "Gov. Mecham is a 
Mormon. . . . I find Mormonism a cult and not Christian." 
</P>
<P>
Such contretemps led former Sen. Barry Goldwater, the grand old man of the 
Grand Old Party here, to complain that his party has been taken over by "a 
bunch of kooks." 
</P>
<P>
That complaint did not faze members of the religious right. "When he says 
kook," Conant declared calmly, "we take it to be an abbreviation for 'kindred 
of our King.' "

INSISTS WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN KEPT FULLY INFORMED; 
</P>
<P>
SUNUNU EXPECTS NORIEGA WILL GO

<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu offered "8-to-5" odds Saturday that 
Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega would be out of power within six months. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, interviewed on Cable News Network's Evans and Novak program, made the 
statement after defending the Bush Administration's handling of the U.S. 
response to the attempted coup against Noriega last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would like to see him out. The President has said he wants him 
out, and I can't believe that between the will of the people of Panama, and the 
will of the people of the United States, we can't achieve that," the former New 
Hampshire governor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the business of making predictions," he added, "but if you want 
odds, I'd say 8-to-5 that he probably will be out." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu maintained that the White House had received full information throughout 
the abortive revolt by officers of Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces and that 
he would not shift crisis management from the Pentagon to the White House to 
improve coordination. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional critics have insisted that faulty intelligence and tangled lines 
of authority barred effective U.S. action during the attempted overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu denied reports that he was dissatisfied with the handling of the 
situation, during which U.S. forces blocked some access roads but failed to cut 
off other routes used by loyalist troops to reach the besieged PDF headquarters 
and rescue Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have said a communications gap prevented President Bush from ordering 
U.S. seizure of Noriega while he was briefly in rebel hands. Sununu indicated 
that the assessment was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Bush would have sent in U.S. troops had he known that Noriega -- under 
indictment in a Florida federal court for drug trafficking -- was a captive, 
the chief of staff suggested that a similar situation in the future would meet 
with a different response. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been a high probability earlier that Gen. Noriega was there and a 
communication that would have made it clear that there would not have been 
resistance from those who had taken him in our taking it over, we could have 
started the decision-making process and perhaps moved in that direction," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu also signaled that other Latin American governments should not regard 
the Panama performance as an indication of future action. Asked if the 
Sandinista regime in Nicaragua could now disregard U.S. pressure for a free 
election there next February, Sununu replied: 
</P>
<P>
"If they do make that assumption and not have a fair election, I think they're 
going to be surprised, not only by the U.S. reaction, but the reaction around 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu emphasized that in both Panama and Nicaragua, the Administration sees 
political pressure rather than military action as the primary instrument of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-range interest of this country and of the Western world is that what 
we get is a concerted pressure on Noriega and a concerted pressure on the 
regime in Nicaragua," he said. "That has achieved results. In the Western 
Hemisphere, virtually all countries but those two have democratically elected 
leaders . . . and I think we can continue to achieve that kind of results."

FROM CALIFORNIA THEY CAME, APPEALING TO A NATION TO ADDRESS HOMELESS CRISIS

They call doorways on opposite sides of Santa Ana's Civic Center their home, 
but Pat Ford and Ruben Kronstedt were fighting more than City Hall Saturday as 
they trudged through the streets -- they were challenging a nation. 
</P>
<P>
Clutching sweaters and stroking windblown hair, the middle-aged men watched 
intently, occasional grins obscured by their unshaven faces and tired eyes, as 
impassioned chants rose around them. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, 24-year-old Stacy Brunnage, a kitchen volunteer from West Los Angeles, 
chatted enthusiastically with friends and co-workers about her three-day exodus 
to meet with congressional leaders and aides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Works the Crowd 
</P>
<P>
Only steps away, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) stood perched near a California 
banner that nearly stretched the width of the street. Working the crowd as only 
a politician can, Bates remained distant, chatting amiably. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, Kronstedt, Brunnage and Bates were among tens of thousands of Americans 
from different walks of life and from different parts of the country who 
gathered Saturday to call attention to common concerns: the crisis of 
homelessness and the need for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
It was a journey that many plan to make again. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come here to get off the street," Ford said. "Anyone who thinks that 
coming here and marching will get everyone off the street is just silly. We 
will have to come back and do this again and again and again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A First Step' 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a first step -- a beginning," observed Scott Mather, chairman of the 
California Homeless Commission. The Orange County resident said the "Housing 
Now!" march drew more than 1,000 participants from various activist groups in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this shows we have built a grass-roots group that believes housing -- 
affordable housing -- is a problem in our state," Mather said. 
</P>
<P>
It is a problem, activists contend, that stretches beyond the visibly homeless 
living in cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The stereotypical derelicts and winos are just the tip of the iceberg," said 
Wynn Landowski, who heads the Westside Shelter Coalition in Santa Monica. 
"Hopefully, this will help everyone notice it's not all people on the streets. 
It's working people who can't afford rent, living in garages. It's people 
living in cars who are too proud to admit they don't have a home. . . . It's 
the hidden homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully for them," Landowski continued, "this is the second civil rights 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Sentiments 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't make the connection between the homeless and affordable 
housing," said Ann Reiss Lane, president of the Los Angeles Board of Fire 
Commissioners. "They contend that homelessness is a social problem, and housing 
an economic one. I don't buy that." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Easton, chairwoman of the Irvine Task Force for the Homeless, said the 
federal government has long ignored the growing epidemic of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"For all the talk lately about desecration of the flag being a disgrace . . . 
the real desecration is all these people in the streets," said Easton, who as a 
child experienced the hardships of the Great Depression. "Even in the 
Depression, (homelessness) wasn't this bad. I resent bitterly how there can be 
so much wealth and so much poverty." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. B. O. Everett, the oldest member of an entourage of homeless and 
shelter volunteers from South-Central Los Angeles, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparison to Dog Shelters 
</P>
<P>
"If this nation can build shelters to keep dogs off the street," Everett said, 
"we ought to be able to get humans off the street." 
</P>
<P>
Brunnage, the West Los Angeles kitchen volunteer who is employed as a 
student-teacher, said homeless children are often the rule rather than the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
"We're raising a generation of homeless," she said. "They come to school tired 
and hungry . . . full of shame and embarrassment. Solutions to this are doable, 
but there is that real 'not in my back yard' syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Rally participants pushed their way through the crowded streets to a temporary 
stage constructed near the Capitol. There they heard words of hope and 
encouragement from Hollywood stars and were entertained by the likes of 
Jefferson Airplane, Tracy Chapman, Stevie Wonder and Los Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Now, Little Optimism 
</P>
<P>
But Ford and Kronstedt, who make their home at the Santa Ana Civic Center, were 
not optimistic about quick improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a lot will get done until more homeless get involved with it," 
Kronstedt said. "But right now there's too much apathy and too much fear. That 
will take time." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Ford said. Pointing to the Capitol building, he said: "It will take 
time, but we're going to beat these people."

STATE HURT BY OFF-ROAD ENGINES DEAL IN CLEAN AIR BILL, WILSON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring it "a disaster for California," Sen. Pete Wilson warned Saturday that 
a landmark clean air compromise reached last week in the House of 
Representatives would result in smoggier air throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican lawmaker said that while the compromise reached between two 
longtime foes over ways to strengthen the Clean Air Act would extend 
California's stricter tailpipe emission standards to all 50 states starting in 
1994, it would also strip California of its authority to set tighter standards 
for off-road engines and transfer that power to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect, Wilson said in a telephone interview from Washington, would 
mean more -- not less -- air pollution in California. Wilson said if the 
preemption provision stands, the four-county South Coast Air Basin will fail to 
meet clean air standards as planned by the year 2007. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that by the year 2009 the emissions from off-road engines in the 
Los Angeles basin would be equivalent to 6 million vehicles or 30 large oil 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to throw my body before the train before I ever allow that to get 
out of the Senate. It's a disaster not just for the L.A. basin but for every 
area in the state (that fails to meet clean air standards)," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
When the compromise was reached last week between Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) and Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) it was almost universally hailed as 
the end of a years-long House debate over how to strengthen the federal Clean 
Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has long opposed 
any amendments to the act that would be costly to auto makers, a good 
proportion of which are in his Detroit district. Waxman, chairman of the Health 
and Environment subcommittee, represents part of the nation's smoggiest 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the breakthrough, Waxman and Dingell pledged to accept no 
amendments in the House that would alter the compromise, which is using 
President Bush's clean air proposal as its framework. Waxman said the bill does 
not have every provision sought by environmentalists, "But when it's looked at 
as a whole, I think almost everyone will agree that it's balanced, fair, tough 
and will bring effective and sensible reductions in air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
But mounting opposition in California, along with expectations that the Senate 
will move a stronger bill of its own, left the future of the compromise in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's views were backed by key state and regional officials, state 
Environmental Affairs Secretary Jananne Sharpless, California Energy Commission 
Chairman Charles R. Imbrecht and James M. Lents, executive officer of the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a peril in this. California could really find itself under the 
stick," Bill Sessa, a spokesman for Sharpless, said. 
</P>
<P>
Sessa pointed out that the "off-road engine" category includes more than 
off-road recreational vehicles. "It's literally everything that doesn't have a 
license plate. It includes construction equipment, engines on offshore oil 
rigs, ships and locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
"Were this amendment to stay in the bill it would preclude us from regulating a 
major cause of our pollution problem," Sessa said. Off-road engines account for 
12% of all hydrocarbon emissions in the state and 15% of oxides of nitrogen 
emissions. The two are the chief ingredients of photochemical smog. 
</P>
<P>
Lents, of the AQMD, said in an interview: "It isn't good. It's not a good 
portion of the compromise." 
</P>
<P>
But Lents said it was not clear whether the compromise would result in worse 
air or simply a wash when increased emissions from off-road engines are 
balanced by tougher tailpipe standards on out-of-state motor vehicles, which 
make up 25% of the cars on California roads. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the amendment) doesn't give us as much as we would like. If the EPA 
decides not to regulate these off-road engines . . . then you're getting close 
to a trade-off. The trade-off would be sort of neutral for California," Lents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Saturday he believed it unlikely that the EPA would enforce a 
California standard on off-road engines. "You sure as hell would have no 
guarantee and you'd have people busy lobbying to see that they don't," he said. 
"The expectation would be there would be no stringent standards." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is moving its own clean air legislation and ultimately differences 
between the two will have to be resolved in a joint conference committee.

A federal mining investigator contends that a cinder block barrier was removed 
illegally from inside a coal mine about 15 minutes before an explosion that 
killed 10 people last month. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Finnie, a special investigator for the U.S. Mine Safety and Health 
Administration, said in a sworn statement submitted to a court Friday that 
removing the barrier disrupted air currents in the Pyro Mining Co. mine, 
creating dangerous levels of explosive methane. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Siler, president of Costain Coal Inc., parent to Pyro Mining, said last 
month that a barrier was taken down inside the Western Kentucky mine the 
morning of the explosion Sept. 13, but he said it was removed after the fatal 
blast, not 15 minutes before. 
</P>
<P>
He also contended that removal of the barrier could not have been a factor, 
even if it came before the accident.

PUERTO RICAN'S 50-YEAR GOAL: STATEHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GLASS, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grand old man of Puerto Rico's statehood movement is Luis A. Ferre, a 
millionaire philanthropist and former governor. 
</P>
<P>
At 85, the venerated Don Luis is still going strong, overseeing his charitable 
foundation and chasing an ideal that has eluded him over a political career 
spanning nearly half a century: U.S. statehood for Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that this was going to take time," he said in an interview a few days 
before flying to Washington for Senate hearings on Puerto Rico's future 
relationship with the United States. "It was a question of waiting for the 
thing to evolve to the proper time." 
</P>
<P>
Ferre says that the time has finally come and predicts that a referendum 
planned for 1991 will see a 60% majority in favor of abandoning Puerto Rico's 
status as a U.S. commonwealth and making the Caribbean island the 51st state. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre has played a prominent role in Puerto Rican politics since World War II. 
He was a member of the assembly that produced the 1952 constitution, founded 
the pro-statehood New Progressive Party in 1967 and was governor from 1969 to 
1972. Today, he is chairman of the island's Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
But his most enduring work may be his philanthropy, in particular the Ponce 
Museum of Art, which London's Financial Times called "one of the most 
distinguished private collections in the Western Hemisphere outside the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Ferre opened the museum in Ponce, his birthplace in southern Puerto Rico, in 
1959 with 120 of his own paintings. Today, it houses 500 paintings, including 
several noted Pre-Raphaelites, along with hundreds of sculptures and artifacts, 
with a total estimated value of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre's grandfather was a French engineer who worked on the Panama Canal before 
settling in Cuba. His father, Antonio, moved to Puerto Rico as a young man and 
married Maria Aguayo Casals, a cousin of the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals, who 
lived in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where 
he was captain of the fencing team. 
</P>
<P>
He was trained at the New England Conservatory of Music also. He is an 
accomplished classical pianist, occasionally performing in public, and still 
tries to put in a few hours of practice every day. 
</P>
<P>
It was during his university days, Ferre said, that he developed a passion for 
the "American way of democracy" and eventual statehood for Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
On his return to the island, Ferre got a job as an engineer at the Puerto Rico 
Iron Works. Later, he and a brother, Joseph, founded the Puerto Rico Cement Co. 
in Ponce, the source of the family's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
In his first philanthropic venture, Ferre founded the Ponce Public Library in 
1937. At about the same time, he bought the city's newspaper, El Dia, which was 
in danger of folding. 
</P>
<P>
"My theory was that a city without a newspaper is a city without a soul," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When he became governor, Ferre sold the newspaper to his son, Antonio, who 
moved it to San Juan. It is now the pro-statehood El Nuevo Dia, one of the 
biggest of Puerto Rico's four dailies.

USE OF DRUGS INCREASING AT DESERT MARINE CORPS BASE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>

<P>
Methamphetamine use, a growing practice recently among Marines stationed here, 
is now the base's most widespread illegal drug problem, military officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Ground Combat Center, a training base for about 9,000 Marines, is in 
the high desert about 100 miles east of San Bernardino, an area authorities say 
is a center for illegal methamphetamine labs because of its isolation and 
sparse population. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much of the drug in the area you have to figure it's going to 
eventually impact the base," said 1st Lt. James Western, who heads the base's 
drug and alcohol counseling center. "On East Coast bases, crack is the big 
problem, but out here the problem is 'meth.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last month, 10 Marines tested positive for methamphetamine use on random 
urinalysis tests, base officials said. And, according to the Naval 
Investigative Service, about 20 Marines at Twentynine Palms have been arrested 
in the last two years for distributing the drug. 
</P>
<P>
But Marines on base say those caught represent only a fraction of users. 
</P>
<P>
"You see guys dragging in on Monday, wasted, saying they haven't slept or ate 
the whole weekend," said one Marine, who requested anonymity. "It makes you 
real nervous when you're out on a night fire with guys like that and they're 
shooting off missiles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputies Break Up Ring 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies broke up a 
methamphetamine ring near Twentynine Palms and arrested 35 people who had been 
selling the drug. Although no one from the base was arrested, a number of 
Marines had made purchases from the dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out that some of the dealers were selling regularly to Marines," said 
Larry Bowman, a senior deputy in the sheriff's narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps will not release statistics on the number of Marines who have 
been discharged because of drug use. But base officials have recognized that 
methamphetamine, or speed, use is a major problem and they have "told our 
department to address it," Western said. 
</P>
<P>
Random urinalysis testing is more frequent now, he said, including occasional 
"unit sweeps," where entire battalions are tested. Drug awareness classes are 
mandatory for both officers and noncommissioned officers. And, Western said, 
base leaders have allocated more resources for drug treatment and enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The base offers counseling and an outpatient treatment program. Marines with 
more serious drug problems are sent to the drug-treatment center at the Miramar 
Naval Air Station in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Those who voluntarily seek treatment generally are not prosecuted, Western 
said. But Marines found using drugs "often are discharged or court-martialed," 
he said. "They have to have extraordinary potential . . . to be allowed to stay 
in."

EUPHORIA BEGINS TO FADE FOR JAPAN'S SOCIALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months after voters handed Japan's Socialists the biggest election gains 
they have ever enjoyed, the party that once declared "American imperialism" to 
be the "common enemy of mankind" stands closer to a share in running the 
government than at any time since it headed a coalition in 1947-48. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts in foreign countries pour forth speculation about what a Socialist-led 
coalition would mean to U.S. relations with Japan. The charismatic Socialist 
chairwoman, Takako Doi, finds herself swamped with requests for interviews. And 
Japanese voters, more than ever, say they are fed up with governments that have 
been run solely by the Liberal Democratic Party since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook remains strong for another setback for the Liberal Democrats and 
major gains for the Socialists in a crucial forthcoming election for the lower 
house of Parliament, which elects the prime minister. It must be held by next 
July but could come as early as the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
However, the euphoria that set in at Socialist headquarters after voters handed 
the Liberal Democrats their first-ever defeat in the upper house July 23 is 
beginning to fade. 
</P>
<P>
The party remains woefully short of candidates for the election. Inner-party 
squabbles have re-emerged. Fearing their own demise in the shadows of the 
Socialist upsurge, potential coalition partners in the non-Communist opposition 
have stepped up their criticism of the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
Polls are showing that the beleaguered Liberal Democrats and their new and 
younger "Mr. Clean," Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 58, have recovered some of 
the support they dissipated through an influence-buying scandal and their 
high-handed enactment of a widely opposed 3% consumption task. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, voters in Ibaraki prefecture (state) adjacent to Tokyo handed the 
Socialists a convincing defeat in a by-election for the upper house, the first 
parliamentary ballot since July. 
</P>
<P>
Three major polls found that fewer than 20% of the voters want to see the 
Liberal Democrats emerge from the forthcoming general election with a solid 
majority. But only about the same percentage want a Socialist-led coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the voters said they favor a coalition headed by the Liberal 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Mood 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet for Doi, the voters' mood on the consumption tax that gave the 
Socialists their biggest boost in the July election appears to be changing. 
Polls now show a slight majority supporting Kaifu's pledge to revise inequities 
of the tax instead of Doi's insistence that it be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
With victories for 257 representatives needed to gain a majority in the 
512-seat lower house, the Socialists now hold only 85 seats and have endorsed 
only 135 candidates. Despite the boost that the party got from its so-called 
Madonna strategy of running a host of women candidates in the upper house 
election, only two of the party's lower house hopefuls are women -- Doi herself 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the combined candidates presently endorsed by the Socialists and their 
three potential opposition partners still don't add up to a majority. Yet, a 
decision by Doi to add another 50 candidates to the Socialist slate for the 
lower house election has met resistance both from within the party and from its 
would-be opposition partners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Egoistic Belief' 
</P>
<P>
Masashi Ishibashi, Doi's predecessor, announced he will refrain from running in 
the next lower house election and retire from politics to protest Doi's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We should run about 150 candidates, and then join the other parties in 
co-sponsoring 40 or 50 more," he told the Asahi newspaper. "That strategy would 
firm up trust among the opposition parties as partners. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not share the egoistic belief that the mood that prevailed during the 
upper house election will continue, intact, into the lower house election," 
Ishibashi said. "Our boom was a passing phenomenon. The upper house election 
results are not a reflection of Socialist strength." 
</P>
<P>
Ishibashi's criticism marked the first attack on Doi's leadership by her own 
party since she took over in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the party for not going far enough to make its policies on 
the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and Japan's own armed forces acceptable to 
voters and to its potential coalition allies. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing what was dubbed the "Doi Vision," the party's chairwoman declared 
that a Socialist-led coalition would retain the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty -- 
the abrogation of which the Socialists still advocate in their party platform. 
</P>
<P>
But she added that such a coalition would demand that the United States clarify 
whether its ships and aircraft bear nuclear weapons when they enter or pass 
over Japanese territory. It also would demand that joint military exercises 
with the United States be ended, that U.S. bases in Japan be reduced and 
ultimately eliminated and that there be no increases in financial support for 
U.S. armed forces stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
Duties of Japan's own Self-Defense Forces, moreover, would be limited to 
Japanese territory -- wiping out a promise Japan made to the United States in 
1981 to defend its sea lanes out to a distance of 1,000 miles. Japan also would 
reduce its defense spending "in line with international disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
As a package, the new policy amounted to the Socialists passing the initiative 
for abrogating the treaty from themselves to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the major would-be coalition partners -- the neo-Buddhist Komei (Clean 
Government) Party and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party -- 
condemned the new security policy. 
</P>
<P>
Even Takeshi Kurokawa, chairman of Sohyo, the labor federation that provides 
the Socialists their chief organizational support, urged Doi to clarify whether 
a Socialist-led coalition would retain Japan's position as an ally of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coalition Government 
</P>
<P>
Japan may, indeed, wind up with a coalition government -- whether in name or 
only in substance -- after the lower house election, but it isn't likely to be 
headed by the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
With their defeat in the upper house, the Liberal Democrats already need help 
from the opposition to enact legislation. Only treaties and the national budget 
can be enacted without approval by the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
As the Asahi newspaper, commenting on its opinion poll, put it, "The feeling of 
the people for a change in politics is strong, but they are hesitating to hand 
over power to the opposition in one fell swoop."

BILLIONAIRE TOUTS HONG KONG AS BASE FOR U.N.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Asia's richest men and biggest landlords has an idea to ease tensions 
over Hong Kong when China regains control of the prosperous British colony in 
1997 -- rent it. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-based billionaire Stanley Ho hopes China will agree to lease the 
colony to the United Nations as the world body's Asian headquarters, thus 
avoiding the problems of a Communist government ruling a capitalist outpost. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, which Ho says came to him in a dream after he dozed while listening 
to a recording of Schumann's "Fantaisie," is the latest of several schemes to 
save Hong Kong from expected oppression and economic downturn when China takes 
control in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gathers Support 
</P>
<P>
Although the mainland has promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its capitalist 
system for 50 years after 1997 as a special region, tens of thousands of 
disbelieving residents have already left for other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing depressed 
confidence further and residents have swarmed to the colony's foreign 
consulates, hoping to join the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of China offering to lease Hong Kong to the United Nations might 
appear unrealistic, but unlike plans to move the colony's 5.7 million people to 
a "new Hong Kong" in the Scottish highlands or Australia, the concept has 
garnered supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's entirely feasible," said Cliff Reece, chairman of the Hong Kong 
Foundation 3000, a business lobby group. "Hong Kong is an international city. 
It would be the perfect place for the United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong government officials called the idea foolish. The U.S. consul general 
had no comment, and Chinese officials in the colony said they had no knowledge 
of Ho's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Reece, however, said his foundation has approached "senior mainland officials" 
with the idea and received "very favorable responses." He said he was unable to 
identify the officials involved because none wanted to be publicly linked to 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"China would gain a lot of prestige by having the United Nations on its soil," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ho, the operator of casinos in the nearby Portuguese territory of Macao and 
elsewhere in Asia, as well as interests in construction, transport and 
entertainment industries, said the plan would be in China's best economic 
interest as well as convey great prestige to the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
"As things stand now, China is the big loser," he said. "When they take over 
Hong Kong, all the people will have already left. If they agree to lease Hong 
Kong to the United Nations, confidence will soar, Hong Kong will become the 
Switzerland of Asia and people will keep investing here." 
</P>
<P>
Ho said his plan could be put into action without altering the 1984 
Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, which allows the colony to retain 
its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997, while China rules it as a 
"special administrative region." 
</P>
<P>
"The policy of 'one country, two systems,' would not change," he said. "China 
would still have sovereignty over Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the scheme said persuading key nations to support it would be 
easy. France and the United States should back the idea, they said, because it 
would help assure China's respect for human rights in post-1997 Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese aren't going to assault the United Nations," Reece said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good for Britain 
</P>
<P>
As for Britain, Ho said the colonial master of Hong Kong would jump at a chance 
to support an idea relieving it of moral responsibility for the 3.5 million 
holders of British overseas passports in the colony. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has refused to grant right of abode in the United Kingdom to the 
overseas passport holders, sparking increased anxiety in the colony. 
</P>
<P>
The plan's supporters said the Soviet Union also should back the idea because 
it would put a major U.N. facility in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
If the future goes according to Ho's dream, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would 
announce his plan to lease Hong Kong to the United Nations on Oct. 1 -- the 
40th anniversary of the Communist revolution in China. 
</P>
<P>
But Ho is willing to settle for even less. 
</P>
<P>
"All the old boy has to do is even suggest that he is considering the idea and 
confidence in Hong Kong will be restored overnight," Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong government officials admitted that Ho's analysis probably 
was true, many were more than a little skeptical of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Bradley, Hong Kong deputy political adviser, said pursuing the plan was 
"totally foolish." 
</P>
<P>
"I should think the idea is quite unlikely," he said. "I shall be fascinated to 
hear what the Chinese have to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the New China News Agency, China's official news agency and its 
unofficial diplomatic representative in Hong Kong, not only refuse to comment 
on the idea but say they've never heard of it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consul General Donald Anderson admitted talking to Reece about the idea, 
but he refused to comment on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted by skeptics, the scheme's supporters say they are hiring lobby groups 
in Washington and New York to sell the idea to the U.S. government and the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep trying anything we can," Ho said. "People must continue to 
invest in Hong Kong or it will die."

Maxim's, Beijing's best-known symbol of Western bourgeois elegance, will reopen 
at the end of the month, five months after it closed following the military 
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
French manager Song Huaigui said Saturday the restaurant, a popular spot for 
well-heeled foreigners since it opened in 1983, will resume its dinner service 
but for the time being will remain closed at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is a joint venture of the French and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
The area around Maxim's, about a mile southeast of Tian An Men Square, was 
racked by violence June 3-4 when the military shot its way into the city and 
recaptured the square from students demonstrating for democracy.

SCENIC MILITARY RANGE, ONCE OFF-LIMITS, PUTS OUT WELCOME MAT 
</P>

GILA BEND, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government is putting out the welcome mat at a remote gunnery range 
twice the size of Delaware and often as inhospitable as a Gila monster, even 
when nobody's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, contradictions abound at the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, a 
2.7-million-acre preserve in the southwestern corner of Arizona. Described as 
the Free World's largest target range, it encompasses seven areas where 
fighters strafe and bomb simulated trains, convoys and missile bases and three 
others where pilots practice dogfights. 
</P>
<P>
An information packet, which includes an agreement absolving the military of 
any harm to the visitor, refers to unexploded ordnance dating back to the 1940s 
and warns that "munitions items are designed to maim and kill." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the range is so inhospitable that Spanish explorers named an east-west 
trail El Camino del Diablo -- "The Devil's Road." Historians estimate that 
hundreds have died of fatigue or dehydration in remote parts of the range over 
the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's evidence out there of at least 40 old graves along the route," said 
1st Lt. Michele S. Monroe, chief of a natural resource management unit at Luke 
Air Force Base outside Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But she said the range also is "an irreplaceable national treasure," a trove of 
biological wonders and opportunities for hikers, backpackers, hunters and 
prospectors in a landscape that varies from post-Armageddon flats to a rich 
overlay of plant life on bacon-colored peaks. 
</P>
<P>
A civil engineer, Monroe won the Department of Defense's prestigious Natural 
Resource Conservation Award in 1988 for projects to study the endangered 
Sonoran pronghorn antelope, to build eight water-catchment basins among the 
crags and to repair damage to El Camino del Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to the concrete dams that seal off rock-walled washes to collect 
up to 50,000 gallons each during rainy periods, the range's herds of desert 
bighorn sheep are on the increase, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft avoid the 822,000-acre Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, run by 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and studies indicate that the animals 
closer to bombing areas have adjusted, Monroe says. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told by bighorn hunters who have been out there during a sonic boom 
that the sheep may look up from eating, but they don't bolt and run," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural Wonders 
</P>
<P>
Dick Thomas, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management office in Phoenix, 
says he was surprised by the natural wonders detailed in a new land-use plan 
produced by his agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Phoenix for 35 years, and I thought that was one big flat where 
they'd bombed the hell out of the scenery since 1941," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the live bombs sometimes dropped, the Air Force, which operates on the 
east end, and the Marines in the west, have kept most of the range pristine, 
says Carole K. Hamilton, the BLM's area manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The public image of a bombing range may be misplaced in this case, because 
most of the ground has not been blown up," Hamilton says. "A lot of people 
think this is one of the cleanest areas in terms of not having a lot of brass 
on the ground, target drones and other debris." 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for protection not only of flora and fauna, but of geologic 
formations -- dunes near Yuma -- and historic and prehistoric sites. The plan 
was developed under the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Congress reserved the range and five others for the next 15 years, changed its 
name to honor Goldwater, a senator from Arizona and the 1964 Republican 
presidential nominee, and designated the BLM to manage resources everywhere but 
on the Cabeza Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
The plan notes that the primary mission of the range is to train pilots and 
aerial gunners for the Air Force, and for the Navy through the Marine Corps Air 
Station at Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
But it also calls for limited, on-road recreational use and for creation of 
areas of "critical environmental concern" and special management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entry Registration 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are required to register at one of several entry points, stay on 
established roads and telephone the military when they leave the largely 
unfenced range. The entry checkpoints give visitors an information kit with 
maps clearly marking target areas. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the military never uses the range on Saturdays or Sundays, when 
public use is highest. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Stephen M. Roberts, commander of the 832nd Combat Support Squadron at 
the Gila Bend Auxiliary Field, foresees few problems with greater public use of 
the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have some instruments out there that we don't want moved or molested," 
Roberts says. "Some are calibrated. But our greatest concern about increased 
public use would be illegal or unauthorized off-road vehicle use." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also could wander into a target zone, interrupting the training. And 
those who forget to telephone when leaving could find themselves assessed for 
search expenses or barred from the range for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Wayne St. John, Roberts' operations officer, says the sheer size of the 
range, and the maps and instructions in the visitors' kit, preclude 
unintentional visits to gunnery areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There's plenty of federal property out there that's not used as gunnery 
range," he says. "Three-fourths of it is not." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts says a greater problem has been motorists shooting holes in warning 
signs on the fences along state Route 85. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting the public off from much of the southwestern corner of Arizona has 
produced some quirky reactions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1941, ranchers grazing livestock on what was to become the bombing range 
refused to vacate the land until nearly three weeks after Pearl Harbor, when a 
federal court overrode provisions of a grazing law and authorized the military 
to take possession. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, word got out that money was to be made recycling brass shell 
casings ejected by aircraft on strafing runs. That led to a May, 1974, incident 
in which five young men, hired to collect the casings, died after being 
abandoned on the range without provisions. 
</P>
<P>
There is little likelihood of a repeat tragedy: Most of the guns aboard the 
F-15, F-16 and A-10 aircraft used today spit the valuable casings into 
containers and bring them back.

VISIT TO POLICE OPEN HOUSE PROVES A HAPPY DUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Westchester man stumbled on a mortar shell while housecleaning Saturday, and 
assuming the worst, he loaded the explosive in a car and drove two blocks to 
the nearest Los Angeles police station. 
</P>
<P>
And although the vintage shell was a dud, no one knew for sure until about 
11:15 a.m., when police declared safe the area around the Police Department's 
Southwest Division station on West Martin Luther King Boulevard, Sgt. Tim Tyree 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Nalepa, 35, took his discovery to the station at 9:45 a.m., pulling up to 
the curb at the station's front doors with the 8-inch-long, 60-millimeter shell 
in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
The Westchester man, who said he found the shell in a garage while helping 
relatives clean out a Harvard Boulevard house to ready it for sale, suspected 
his find was an inactive souvenir but vowed not to take chances. "Instead of 
leaving it for the next owner, I figured I'd take it to somebody who could 
dispose of it properly." 
</P>
<P>
Police reacted by closing off a one-block stretch of Martin Luther King 
Boulevard and evacuating people from an auto repair shop and a restaurant 
across the street, Tyree said. Bomb squad officers were then called to examine 
the device and haul it away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inside the station, about 20 officers who were on duty were told to 
go to the back of the building and stay there while the mortar shell was 
investigated. Another 70 or so people, including police and local residents 
attending the station's first open house, were already milling about a parking 
lot in the rear of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"We were real low-key about it," Tyree said, noting the open house was held 
behind the station and away from the commotion. "And they thought it was part 
of our everyday routine."

RESEARCHERS PROBE VIRGINIA CHURCHYARD; 
</P>
<P>
CONFEDERATE SOLDIER'S COFFIN DISCOVERED 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a summer's eve nearly 127 years ago, a small band of Confederate soldiers 
sifted through a battle-scarred Virginia churchyard, determined to give their 
slain comrades a proper burial. 
</P>
<P>
Working by the light of a fire, they quickly dug shallow graves and placed the 
dead in caskets crudely fashioned from eight-foot-long church pews, according 
to a firsthand account of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Recently a team of Smithsonian researchers working at the site near Brandy 
Station in Culpeper County, about 60 miles southwest of Washington, unearthed 
one of the makeshift coffins, which contained a fairly complete skeleton of a 
rebel soldier buried in his boots. 
</P>
<P>
The coffin also held the man's clay pipe, glass shirt buttons and metal buttons 
apparently from a double-breasted jacket. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant Find' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a truly exciting discovery," said Douglas Owsley, the forensic 
anthropologist who led the excavation. "It's probably one of the more 
significant Civil War finds in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
Owsley, who has helped police identify murder victims from skeletal remains, 
estimated that the soldier was at least 30 years old when he died, based on the 
condition of his teeth and other factors. With the help of some historians, he 
said, researchers might be able to determine the man's identity. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier belonged to the Washington Artillery unit from New Orleans, which 
on Aug. 23, 1862, was caught in cross-fire between Union troops and 
Confederates under the command of Gen. James Longstreet. The fighting, a 
prelude to the Second Battle of Manassas, occurred near Beverly Ford on the 
Rappahannock River. 
</P>
<P>
"The discovery is consistent with much folklore about the site," Owsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Owen, a participant in the skirmish, recorded the burial scene in a 
book titled "In Camp and Battle with The Washington Artillery": 
</P>
<P>
"At night a burial detail performed the last sad rites to our dead comrades by 
the flickering light of a blazing fire of logs and rails, having made rude 
coffins of the pews of St. James Church, which, meaning no sacrilege, were 
appropriated for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
The church, built on the Fredericksburg-Winchester road in 1842, was destroyed 
by Union troops later in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Smithsonian researchers were invited to the two-acre site by a descendant 
congregation, Christ Episcopal Church of Brandy Station, which wished to learn 
about its roots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Discovery 
</P>
<P>
Besides the soldier's body and coffin, the team found 55 military and civilian 
graves that remain to be excavated, some bullets, a harness, food-ration cans 
and the ruins of the original church. 
</P>
<P>
The unearthed coffin was buried about three feet underground and had no top or 
bottom, apparently for lack of time and tools, Owsley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing to see the reaction from the members of the church when we 
discovered the grave," Owsley said. "They were ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
The soldier was "one of the last things we found" during the two-week 
expedition, Owsley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to go back to the site for further excavation, but noted 
that by the end of the recent trip most of the 27 members of his team, some of 
them college students, were "so busy scratching from poison ivy they were ready 
to leave." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers plan to recommend that the site be included in the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Owsley said the remains of the Confederate soldier eventually will be returned 
to the church. 
</P>
<P>
Clark B. Hall, director of the Fredericksburg, Va.-based Assn. for Preservation 
of Civil War Sites Inc., said the densely wooded area where Owsley's team 
worked was the site of the largest cavalry fight of the war, the Battle of 
Brandy Station, on June 9, 1863, a month before Gettysburg. 
</P>
<P>
More than 9,000 troops clashed "saber to saber and stirrup to stirrup" at 
Brandy Station, Hall said. "The battle was a watershed event in Civil War 
history in that as a result . . . Union cavalry began their ascendancy over 
their counterparts in gray. . . . At Brandy Station they proved that they could 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,400 Casualties 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 casualties, many of them near St. James Church, were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and other preservationists are in a fight with a developer who plans to 
build a shopping center, office park and houses on about 5,000 acres nearby. 
"We're hoping (the developer) works with us to ensure that the significant 
sites where heavy fighting and heavy casualties occurred can be protected," 
said Hall, who accompanied the team during the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was "thrilled" with the recent discoveries. "It makes someone like 
myself doing historical research extremely excited. It's a very important 
find."

ZOO UP TREE AS SUN BEARS PLAY HOUDINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 73 years, the San Diego Zoo has had a lot to brag about. Its proudest 
moments, however, would not fall under the title "The Great Escape." 
</P>
<P>
There was the rare, 600-pound African antelope that thundered across a golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
There was the jaguar that skittered between a keeper's legs and caromed toward 
the exit, its claws clicking on the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the orangutan that left for a stroll, only to surrender -- to 
everyone's goggle-eyed amazement -- to a keeper's outstretched palm. 
</P>
<P>
Those were one-shot escapades, easily squelched. Now, however, a pair of 
Malaysian sun bears at the zoo appear to be out to break all records, and to 
possess the savvy of Houdini when it comes to escaping. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 3 p.m. on Sept. 23, the 100-pound Ringo climbed over a wall and 
ended up on the patio of Sun Bear Forest. Onlookers apparently thought it was 
part of a show and made an attempt to cozy up to Ringo, who was just trying to 
act naturally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third Sun Bear Escape 
</P>
<P>
Ringo's was the third escape by a sun bear since the animals' new $3.5-million 
exhibit opened in June. 
</P>
<P>
Muffin, Ringo's female playmate, escaped the two other times. 
</P>
<P>
The bears' antics have zoo officials worried, so much so that a guard has been 
posted at the exhibit during visiting hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time these bears get out it's a problem -- and a potential grave hazard 
-- for zoo visitors," zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said with furrowed brow. "We 
can't seem to convince the public that, although small, these animals are not 
Yogi Bear or Winnie the Pooh. Sun bears have the ability to do a lot of damage 
to human beings. 
</P>
<P>
"They have big claws for digging and teeth that could easily deliver a big 
bite. We face the dual hazard of a person or a bear getting hurt, and then the 
very real possibility of incurring a major lawsuit. So, yes, we're worried." 
</P>
<P>
Escapes notwithstanding, the bears have managed to do considerable damage to 
the exhibit, Jouett said, which has the theme of "native habitat." What 
zookeepers hadn't counted on was that the cute little bears would gnaw down 
every tree in sight, along with plants and grassy slopes, and destroy a $25,000 
fiberglass "tree" with an automatic honey dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said the zoo resisted using electrical wiring, but, as it turns out, the 
bears' claws do not conduct electricity, which keepers didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
He said the bears are "intelligent, curious" animals with "a ferocious climbing 
instinct." 
</P>
<P>
They're just more intelligent, more curious and better at climbing than anyone 
at the zoo thought they could be. 
</P>
<P>
Sun bears weigh 60 to 150 pounds, Jouett said, and the eight on exhibit in the 
1 1/2-acre Sun Bear Forest average about 100 pounds. The bears bear a vague 
resemblance to large dogs, especially those of the hound variety, the kind 
former President Lyndon B. Johnson might have picked up by the ears. 
</P>
<P>
So far -- and Jouett said the zoo is "incredibly fortunate" to be noting this 
-- the escapes have not resulted in injuries to the bears or the passers-by who 
find them so irresistibly cuddly and charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 23, however, Ringo had to be felled by a tranquilizer gun, which 
Jouett said poses problems, the likes of which the zoo hopes not to encounter 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know quite what dosage to give the animal because every animal is 
different. An animal gets out, its adrenaline is racing, and that affects the 
dosage you select. The instinct of such an animal would be fight or flight once 
it escapes. Luckily, Ringo chose flight. Otherwise, some people could have been 
hurt -- seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers have installed sheet metal behind a row of bars in the area where 
each escape took place. They're hoping the metal will prevent claws from 
wrapping around the bars to gain traction. The "visitor assistance officer" is 
now on duty during zoo hours to make sure no further escapes occur or to 
minimize damage if any do. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said the conventional way of housing bears is in a "sunken grotto." The 
zoo had hoped to alter that by having onlookers gaze up at the bears, rather 
than down -- "not quite so condescending," he said -- and offering a kind of 
minimum-security setting to such creatures of the wild. 
</P>
<P>
But the strength and boldness of sun bears, particularly those on view in San 
Diego, have baffled and awed the experts. And now, Jouett said, the zoo may be 
inclined to "rethink" the nature of Sun Bear Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if you designed a human exhibit," he said. "You or I wouldn't be 
able to get out -- but (Olympic athlete) Carl Lewis might. He'd probably just 
jump over. Much to our chagrin, that's exactly what Ringo and Muffin keep 
doing."

GRETZKY SCORES TWICE, BUT OILERS COME BACK TO GAIN A 6-5 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky had two of the Kings' goals as they played even-up through two 
periods, but his former teammates, the Edmonton Oilers, typically jumped on 
every opportunity down the stretch to come away with a 6-5 victory before a 
sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a spirited game between teams that played to a standoff in their eight 
Smythe Division games last season and then battled to the end before the Kings 
eliminated the then Stanley Cup defending champions from the playoffs, winning 
an emotional come-from-behind seven-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach John Muckler said: "I thought L.A. played pretty well. It was 
like a playoff game. I don't think L.A. can play any harder." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers played hard, too, paying no special heed to Gretzky or his pursuit 
of the National Hockey League's all-time scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
The emotion of the big trade is starting to fade. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, they're worrying less about me," Gretzky said. "I'm worrying less 
about them, too. Both of us are more and more comfortable. We're just playing 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had trouble scoring a goal against his former teammates last season, 
not getting his first goal against the Oilers until the sixth game the teams 
played, in March. 
</P>
<P>
Not so Saturday night. He got into the spirit of his record chase, those orange 
and blue sweaters giving him no pause. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's two goals against the Oilers were his first two of the season, adding 
two more points to his career total -- which is now 11 from being the all-time 
record in the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has a total of 1,840 points and is closing fast on the total of 1,850 
that Gordie Howe set during 25 years in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille, who had a goal and two assists Saturday night, said the team is 
not distracted by the knowledge that everyone is watching and counting 
Gretzky's points. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be more pressure if it was at the end of the season and he had 92 
goals or if he was trying to keep one of his big scoring streaks alive," 
Robitaille said. "Then you would have to want him to have the goals. But 11 
points? He's going to get those points. The only question is when." 
</P>
<P>
Robitialle assisted on Gretzky's first goal, making the pass for the shot that 
scooted under the stick of Oiler goalie Bill Ranford, who has replaced Grant 
Fuhr since his emergency appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
That first goal, midway through the first period, gave the Kings a brief lead. 
</P>
<P>
Only 31 seconds later, Kevin McClelland stole the puck from Marty McSorley and 
carried the puck back toward the Kings' goal. Kelly Hrudey came out to meet 
him, but McClelland fired the puck right past him to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored his second goal 1 minute 7 seconds into the second period, 
taking advantage of the power play with Oiler defenseman Kevin Lowe still in 
the penalty box for a holding penalty at the end of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were about to clear the puck out of their zone when Bob Kudelski 
dived to the ice as if he were trying to cover a fumbled football. His body 
deflected the puck out to John Tonelli, who sent it across the ice to where 
Gretzky was waiting near the left post. Gretzky stopped the pass on his 
backhand side, turned, took aim and put a forehand shot past Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
Craig MacTavish tied it for the Oilers again at 4:33 of the second, racing up 
the left side, passing across to Jari Kurri and then getting the puck back from 
Kurri for the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls put the Kings back on top, 3-2, with his first goal of the 
season, scoring on a power play off a centering pass from Robitaille, who 
waited until the split second before he crossed the goal line to make the pass, 
letting Ranford think he was going around behind the net before making the 
perfect pass back to Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, momentum took a turn toward Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen seconds before the Kings could get out of the second period with the 
lead, Mark Messier beat Hrudey to the puck and poked it into the net. Hrudey 
had gone to his knees to stop a long shot by Lowe. The puck was sitting in a 
dangerous spot on the rebound, so Hrudey was scrambling to push it away when 
Messier pounced on it to tie the score at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's linemate in his Oiler days, Kurri, got the goal that put the Oilers 
up, 4-3, early in the third period, scoring only nine seconds into a two-man 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Then a flurry of three goals in less than a minute left the Kings trailing by 
two. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bad stretch for the Kings, starting with a bad decision by Ken 
Baumgartner. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:29, Baumgartner decided to pull up near center ice to check MacTavish into 
the boards. He took MacTavish out of the play, but he also took himself out, 
leaving McSorley facing a two-on-one against Esa Tikkanen and Kurri that ended 
with Tikkanen's goal. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:50, Nicholls' second goal of the game, a strong shot from the right 
circle, put the Kings within one. 
</P>
<P>
But at 10:20, Glenn Anderson flipped the puck past Hrudey as Anderson was 
falling to the ice with defenseman Larry Robinson on top of him. Both Anderson 
and Robinson piled into Hrudey, and they all followed the puck into the net. 
</P>
<P>
With 51 seconds left, Robitaille scored his second goal of the night on a power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
After missing all exhibition games and the first two games of the regular 
season with a pinched nerve in his neck, Dave Taylor plans to play tonight 
against Detroit. . . . King center Hubie McDonough was not at the game Saturday 
night. He had returned to New Haven, Conn., where his wife, Amy, was soon to 
give birth to their first child. . . . Saturday night's game was delayed on 
account of snow. Between the second and third periods malfunctioning 
ice-resurfacing machines dumped three snowbanks on the ice, causing the fans to 
boo and cheer as two machines appeared and disappeared, taking turns trying to 
get the ice cleaned. Finally, one of the machines came to life to clean the 
ice. The game was delayed about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS 
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's all-time regular-season scoring record (points and assists) is 
1,850. Through Saturday night's game, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky is 11 points 
away from breaking that record.

UCLA WEARS OUT ARIZONA STATE; 
</P>
<P>
VELASCO KICKS 4 FIELD GOALS, BRUINS PULL AWAY, 33-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
And then there were two. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA fought off a determined effort by Arizona State Saturday night to beat the 
Sun Devils, 33-14, and join USC as the only Pacific 10 teams still unbeaten in 
the race to the Rose Bowl five weeks into the season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a nice place to be," said UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, who moved ahead of 
Washington's Don James and into first place on the all-time list with the 72nd 
conference victory of his 14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona State's conference opener, the Bruins improved to 3-2 overall and 
2-0 in the Pac-10 as four field goals by Alfredo Velasco and a 48-yard 
interception return for a touchdown by linebacker Stacy Argo provided the 
difference before a crowd of 53,188 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Bret Johnson passed for a pair of touchdowns in the second 
quarter, and UCLA, which will take to the road for three of its next four 
games, never trailed while dropping ASU to 3-2 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who completed 16 of 30 passes for 165 yards, has thrown nine touchdown 
passes since winning a tight preseason competiton with Jim Bonds to replace 
Troy Aikman as the Bruins' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore tailback Shawn Wills, making his first start, gained 79 yards in 23 
carries as the UCLA running attack produced almost four yards a carry, a yard 
more than the average it attained in the team's first four games. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems we weren't third and long as much as we had been in the first four 
games," said Johnson, whose well-timed scrambles provided 23 yards in six 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA ended the game with 182 yards rushing against a defense that had given up 
an average of only 80.3 a game to rank eighth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State actually wound up with an advantage in total yards, 359 to 347, 
but quarterback Paul Justin, who completed 27 of 48 passes for 272 yards, had 
two passes intercepted, and the Sun Devils also lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
None of ASU's running plays gained more than eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got good field position, we were able to take advantage of it, for the 
most part," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils were not able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State dominated the first quarter, accumulating 108 total yards while 
limiting the Bruins to 20, but all that got the Sun Devils was a scoreless tie 
because kicker Alan Zendejas, continuing a slump that started last season, 
missed two field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"How did it affect us?" Arizona State Coach Larry Marmie asked. "We certainly 
didn't have a good feeling on the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
Zendejas, a senior from Chino who has made only nine of 20 attempts since 
hitting 15 of 19 as a sophomore, missed from 37 yards after ASU took the 
opening kickoff and drove to UCLA's 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The drive stalled after Justin underthrew flanker Lynn James inside the 
five-yard line and then had a pass intended for wide-open Jeff Simoneau 
deflected by linebacker Meech Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
After cornerback Eddie Stokes intercepted a pass from Johnson on UCLA's first 
play and ASU was able to move only seven yards in three plays from UCLA's 
14-yard line, Zendejas missed a 25-yard attempt. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the quarter, UCLA started a 91-yard touchdown drive in which 
Johnson completed five of six passes for 45 yards, including an eight-yard 
touchdown play to Scott Miller, and scrambled twice for 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's first run, on third-and-five from the ASU 14, produced seven yards 
after he ducked under a tackle and kept the drive alive. 
</P>
<P>
On the touchdown pass, Miller found a hole in Arizona State's zone and, with 
neither strong safety Floyd Fields nor free safety Nathan LaDuke within five 
yards of him, made a diving catch at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State's next possession ended after only three plays when Justin's 
third-down pass was tipped into the air by James and intercepted by strong 
safety Mark McGill, a senior making his first start for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
McGill, who started in place of injured sophomore Matt Darby, made a 21-yard 
return and might have scored if he hadn't been tripped up by Justin at the 
Arizona State eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Johnson completed a three-yard touchdown pass to tight end 
Randy Austin, also making his first start. Austin, filling in for Corwin 
Anthony, made a diving catch in the right side of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA led, 14-0, with 6 minutes 26 seconds left in the half after scoring twice 
in less than three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Justin drove ASU right back the other way, moving the Sun Devils 85 yards in 12 
plays while completing seven of seven passes for 75 yards, including a 
three-yard touchdown pass to tight end Scott Veach. 
</P>
<P>
On third-and-goal from the three-yard line, Justin found Veach in the middle of 
the end zone between cornerback Dion Lambert and free safety Eric Turner, and 
the Sun Devils trailed, 14-7, with 1:08 left after freshman Mike Richey was 
brought on to kick the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Brown returned the ensuing kickoff 23 yards, Kevin Williams ran 11 yards on a 
first-down draw play, and UCLA was on the move again. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's nine-yard pass to tight end Charles Arbuckle moved the Bruins into 
Arizona State territory, and a 23-yard pass to Arbuckle, who flattened LaDuke 
after making the catch, brought UCLA to the ASU 13 with 18 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson twice threw incomplete, and the Bruins had to settle for a 31-yard 
field goal by Alfredo Velasco for a 17-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
A similar fate awaited the Bruins after they took the second-half kickoff and 
drove 64 yards in 12 plays to Arizona State's four-yard line before tailback 
Shawn Wills was stopped after a one-yard gain on third-and-two. 
</P>
<P>
To the obvious displeasure of the crowd, which wanted the Bruins to make an 
attempt for a first down on fourth-and-one, Velasco came on to kick a 21-yard 
field goal, increasing UCLA's lead to 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State's first possession of the second half went three plays and out, 
but after the Sun Devils forced the Bruins to punt, freshman Kevin Miniefield 
partially blocked Kirk Maggio's kick, which rolled dead at UCLA's 42-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-yard pass from Justin to tailback David Winsley would have left the Sun 
Devils with third-and-eight at the UCLA 27, but Lambert was called for a 
personal foul away from the play, giving the Sun Devils a first down at the 13. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Simoneau scored on a two-yard run, cutting Arizona State's 
deficit to 20-14 with 2:32 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like there was a little momentum change," Marmie said. "But 
offensively, we made too many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
On the last play of the quarter, Justin completed a short pass to tight end 
Ryan McReynolds on third-and-five at the UCLA 40, but as McReynolds struggled 
to make a first down, Turner spun him around, and the ball popped loose. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA tackle Mike Lodish grabbed it out of the air, ending another Arizona State 
threat with what was officially called an intercepted fumble. 
</P>
<P>
It was on to the fourth quarter with UCLA holding a six-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
About five minutes into the quarter, Johnson completed a 26-yard pass to 
Austin, and UCLA drove to the Arizona State 16, but the drive stalled, and with 
8:19 left, Velasco kicked a 33-yard field goal to make it 23-14. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco added a 42-yard field goal with 1:14 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
With only 26 seconds left, Argo picked off a deflected pass by Justin and 
carried it 48 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will play three of its next four games on the road -- at Arizona next 
Saturday, at Oregon State Oct. 21 and at Stanford Nov. 4. The Bruins will play 
Washington in their homecoming game Oct. 28 at the Rose Bowl. . . . The 
starting time for Saturday's game at Tucson will be announced today. . . .

JIM MURRAY: HE MIGHT BE ON WRONG END OF SHELL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1940, as the German armies poured across France, the French general, Maxime 
Weygand, who had just been made commander-in-chief over the deposed General 
Maurice Gamelin, flew over the battlefield, then held his head in his hands. 
"Mon Dieu!" he gasped. "They have handed me a disaster!" 
</P>
<P>
It is my notion Art Shell should know exactly how he felt. Art should get the 
croix de guerre, kissed on both cheeks, and enrolled in the Legion d'Honneur. 
</P>
<P>
He has just been made commander- in-chief of a disaster -- the Raiders. They 
are in full retreat, they are confused, surrounded, their best hope would seem 
to be to sue for peace. They don't need a general, they need a priest. 
</P>
<P>
There is an Irish proverb, "Anyone will give you a burning building." Art Shell 
must feel like the guy who's standing outside a bank when a bunch of masked men 
come running along and suddenly thrust a bag of money in his hands and say, 
"Here, hold this!" just as they hear the cops coming. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln used to tell the story of the fellow who was being tarred and feathered 
and ridden out of town on a rail and someone wanted to know how he felt. "If it 
weren't for the honor of the thing, I'd rather walk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Art Shell has become a historic American figure. He joins, if not exactly 
Washington and Lincoln, at least Fulton, Edison, the Wright brothers -- the 
guys who did something first, the guys who made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
He certainly joins Jack Johnson, Jackie Robinson, Kenny Washington, Frank 
Robinson, Bill Russell. Guys who made America live up to its promises. Guys who 
made America be what America is supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't happen to a nicer guy. 
</P>
<P>
But you get the feeling Art was just standing there when the old coach came 
flying through the door with his suitcase sailing after him. He was either in 
the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time. Time 
will tell. But he was not groomed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
When Branch Rickey broke the color line in baseball, it was a deliberate, 
calculated, long-plotted maneuver. He scouted Jackie Robinson for the part. He 
didn't just need a second baseman, he needed a talisman, an icon, a symbol, a 
man for the ages. Jackie didn't happen to be just standing there. 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis just fired the coach he had picked with tender, loving care. There is 
no evidence Art Shell was even a candidate. In fact, when a reporter wondered 
at the press conference announcing the new (white) coach, Mike Shanahan, 
whether owner Davis was leaving himself open to criticism, Davis bridled and 
noted that his record on race was above reproach. Al Davis is colorblind, and 
if you don't think so, check his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
Still, has he handed his new general a disaster? A beaten army? Are the Raiders 
in headlong retreat? Could even Vince Lombardi stop this bleeding? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, historically, have not needed a coach in the mold of Lombardi or 
Rockne. Their coaches were commonly perceived to be just kind of straw bosses. 
Shop stewards. The real orders came down from above. Some people thought the 
running of the team was just a kind of complicated ventriloquism. Al tried not 
to move his lips but the words -- and the plays -- were his. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence seemed to bear the theory out. The Raiders went to four Super 
Bowls under three different coaches in little over a decade -- John Rauch, John 
Madden and Tom Flores. The one constant was the man on the phone upstairs -- Al 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The burden of the evidence is not so much that Coach Mike Shanahan disagreed 
with the advice from above as he ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
You can do a lot of things with Al Davis. Ignoring him is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Will Art Shell get the message? Better yet, will he deliver it? Will he be just 
the answer to a trivia question someday -- or a coaching legend? 
</P>
<P>
The chemistry that goes into the making of a successful coach is at least as 
complicated as the formula for heavy water. Rockne did it with wit and sarcasm 
and a reliance on the putative wishes of long-dead teammates. Lombardi did it 
with the all-out bullying emotion of an Italian opera basso. Tom Landry was 
cerebral, stoic. So was Paul Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Art Shell was a great football player. He almost single-handedly gave 
Minnesota's Purple People Eaters indigestion in the Super Bowl. He's not 
emotional. He's not excitable. He's probably never had to be afraid of anything 
in his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
The X's and O's are not really a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no secrets in this game," the late Buck Shaw used to say. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to convince those kids in the silver and black they are being well 
led, that they are not going to wake up some morning like the French army and 
find themselves surrounded and their Maginot Line the world's biggest flower 
pot. 
</P>
<P>
Every right-thinking person in America wishes Art Shell well. Unfortunately, 
they can't block and tackle for him. 
</P>
<P>
What Coach Shell has to do is put the long pass back in the game plan -- and 
put "Yes, sir, Mr. Davis!" right back in the inter-office intercom. Owners are 
never interim.

RICKEY HENDERSON STEALS THUNDER, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Canseco can hit a home run that nearly kisses the roof, Rick Honeycutt can 
take the Oakland Athletics on another late-inning white-knuckler, and the 
Toronto Blue Jays can unearth yet more hidden character, but Game 4 of these 
American League playoffs, as with the other three, will always be remembered 
for Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to a postseason portfolio that already rivals those of Reggie Jackson, 
Roberto Clemente and George Brett, Henderson hit two two-run home runs Saturday 
-- one a fairway drive, the other a one-iron shot -- to pace the A's to victory 
over the Blue Jays again, this time by a 6-5 score. 
</P>
<P>
The Rickey Series stands at Oakland 3, Toronto 1, with the A's standing on the 
brink of their second consecutive World Series and their ace, Dave Stewart, 
scheduled to start Game 5 today. 
</P>
<P>
To get the A's to this point, all Henderson has done is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reach base 12 times in 19 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hit .417 (five for 12). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steal seven bases in seven attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Score seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruffle more than a few Blue Jay feathers with his 
tip-toe-through-the-brick-dust act in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And now, become the eighth man in the history of the American League 
Championship Series to hit two home runs in one game. 
</P>
<P>
The first broke a scoreless tie in the third inning and landed on the black 
tarpaulin beyond the center-field fence, 440 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The second was a line drive that tucked barely inside the left-field foul pole 
and nestled in the netting behind the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The second homer gave the A's a 5-1 lead that eventually became 6-5 before 
Dennis Eckersley rescued Honeycutt in the eighth inning for his second save of 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the greatest times I've ever had in baseball," said Henderson, 
who will be glad to remind you that he's had many great times in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"As a ballplayer, you always dream of being in this position. I'd always looked 
at great players in the postseason and seen how some of them wouldn't do what 
they're capable of, what they wanted to do. And I always thought, 'When I get 
there, I want to do my best.' 
</P>
<P>
"So far, that's coming true." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Henderson's best was enough to upstage one of the longest home runs 
ever hit in a postseason game -- a third-inning blast by Canseco that was 
estimated at 480 feet, was probably closer to 510 and definitely landed in the 
fifth deck of SkyDome's bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
That deck, which straddles the facility's roof, is officially known as the 
SkyDeck, and before Canseco, nobody had ever hit a SkyBall into the SkyDeck. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland first baseman Mark McGwire came close earlier this season, pinging one 
off the cement facing above the fourth deck that is now covered with red, white 
and blue bunting. 
</P>
<P>
"I had cement stop mine," McGwire said. "Mine was going to China. His was only 
going to Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco said he got a kick out of how his homer instantly muted a SkyDome crowd 
of 50,076 -- "I heard their jaws hit the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he had to be helped off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell off the bench," Henderson said, laughing. "It put mine to shame. I'm 
sitting there thinking that I hit mine a long ways and then he hits one about 
600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It blew my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco hit his homer one out after Henderson's. With two pitches, Toronto 
starter Mike Flanagan had given up three runs on nearly 1,000 feet in home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Flanagan, the real damage was done later by the shortest of 
the lot -- Henderson's fifth-inning line drive down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
"I can live with Jose's home run," Flanagan said. "I can live with Rickey's 
first home run. What I can't live with is Rickey's home run into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"We had come back to make it 3-1 and then I go out and make it 5-1. That's 
tough to accept." 
</P>
<P>
It would prove to be a critical home run, too, because Oakland Manager Tony La 
Russa continues to think it shrewd baseball strategy to bring Honeycutt into 
pressurized playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Bob Welch, a nervous type who hasn't dealt well with these things since 
his storied strikeout of Reggie Jackson in the 1978 World Series, muddled 
through five innings of jams, threats and budding rallies -- somehow escaping 
with only one Blue Jay run and seven runners left on base. 
</P>
<P>
But asking Welch to complete a sixth inning was apparently asking too much. He 
left with two out in the sixth and another Toronto run in, coming on a single 
by Kelly Gruber and a double by Junior Felix. 
</P>
<P>
A relief pitcher, clearly, was needed. Not so clear, however, was La Russa's 
eventual selection, Honeycutt, who faced a total of six batters in Games 2 and 
3 and hadn't retired one. 
</P>
<P>
A man without an ERA -- having given up three runs without recording an out, 
Honeycutt's earned-run average, technically, was "infinity" -- the Oakland 
left-hander walked the first batter he faced, Lloyd Moseby, before finally 
retiring Mookie Wilson on an inning-ending force play. 
</P>
<P>
But that was simply a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, Honeycutt gave up two more hits and another run. Tony 
Fernandez doubled to center and pinch-hitter Pat Borders singled him home. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth inning, Honeycutt failed to field Manny Lee's single and walked 
Moseby to set up a two-run inning for Toronto, an inning that ended only with 
the assistence of Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, despite the heroics of Canseco and Henderson, Oakland led by only 6-5 
with the ninth inning still to play. 
</P>
<P>
Why had La Russa so stubbornly stayed with a relief pitcher who so obviously 
continues to struggle? 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the matchups and I liked them," La Russa said. "I liked Honeycutt 
in the eighth inning against Lee, I liked Felix (a switch-hitter) better 
batting from the right side and I liked him against Moseby (a left-hander), 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real encouraged by Rick Honeycutt. He got us four or five big outs. I'm 
looking at the way he's throwing and he was looking more like himself today. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't be here today without Rick and we wouldn't have won the game 
without him today." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa could talk that way because of the way Eckersley handled the ninth 
inning. Two quick outs, a single to Gruber and then a confrontation with 
pinch-hitter Lee Mazzilli. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley and Mazzilli played chess until the count was full. Eckersley 
check-mated him with a fastball, which jammed Mazzilli and prompted a pop fly 
that A's third baseman Tony Phillips squeezed for the last out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to think about being up, 3-1, right now," La Russa said. "Right now, 
we're exhausted. It was a real hard game. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Cito (Gaston, Toronto's rookie manager) outside if he's sure he wants 
to do this for a living. . . . It was a hard game to win. Both clubs gave 
everything they had." 
</P>
<P>
And because the A's had Rickey Henderson, the American League pennant, for the 
second time in as many years, is today theirs for the taking.

JOCKEY CLUB GOLD CUP AT BELMONT;

Shug McGaughey, the trainer of Easy Goer, wanted more than just a victory in 
Saturday's Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park. He wanted an easy victory -- 
and that's what he got. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Pat this morning, if we can, I want it to be one of those typical Pat 
Day rides," McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
Day is noted for not using a horse more than he has to. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, I don't want you to get to the bottom of him,"' McGaughey said. 
"We have one more stop." 
</P>
<P>
That stop will be a showdown with Triple Crown rival Sunday Silence in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer will go into that race with a five-race winning streak, including 
Saturday's four-length triumph over Cryptoclearance in the $1,099,000 Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he ran fantastic," McGaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
He certainly ran easily, third at the half mile in a leisurely 48 3/5 and in 
front after a mile in 1:39 2/5. He reached the 1 1/4-mile mark in 2:05 and, at 
the time, was being seriously challenged by Cryptoclearance. 
</P>
<P>
About a sixteenth of a mile later, that challenge faded, and Easy Goer romped 
home in 2:29 1/5 for the 1 1/2 miles without ever feeling Day's whip. 
</P>
<P>
The $659,400 first-place money boosted Easy Goer's career earnings to 
$3,859,650. 
</P>
<P>
Cryptoclearance finished 19 1/2 lengths in front of third-place Forever Silver, 
who was three-quarters of a length in front of Prized, who upset Sunday Silence 
in the Swaps at Hollywood Park in July. That came one race after Easy Goer 
began his winning streak by beating Sunday Silence in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Day had Easy Goer fourth entering the backstretch with a mile to go. At that 
point, Impersonator, ridden by Richard Migliore, had a daylight lead, and he 
led until almost the half-mile pole when Day moved Easy Goer past him. 
</P>
<P>
As the horses entered the turn, Jose Santos made his move with Cryptoclearance. 
The 5-year-old moved into second behind Easy Goer with about a quarter-mile 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Momentarily, it looked like Easy Goer might have all he could handle, but he 
quickly dispelled that notion. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer, owned by Ogden Phipps, paid $2.20, $2.20 and $2.10. Cryptoclearance 
paid $3.40 and $2.10, and Forever Silver paid $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer and Prized, the only 3-year-olds in the field, carried 121 pounds, 
while the other five each toted 126 under the weight-for-age format. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the order of finish were Its Acedemic, Jack of Clubs and 
Impersonator, who was eased through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer's record now is eight wins and two seconds in 10 starts this year, 
and 12 wins and four seconds in 16 lifetime starts as he points toward the $3 
million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park, where he can clinch or lose 
both the 3-year-old and Horse of the Year titles.

FALCONS GET ANOTHER DOSE OF RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
THINGS POINT TO A LONG DAY FOR ATLANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To rate the Rams' Super Bowl chances this season, we've called in our panel of 
experts on the subject, the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
No team knows better the strength of Jim Everett's arm, the power of Greg 
Bell's legs or the speed of Henry Ellard's feet. 
</P>
<P>
And who is more qualified than a Falcon to rate Kevin Greene's pass-rush 
technique off the left corner? Greene had three sacks in one game against the 
Falcons last year. 
</P>
<P>
Like the national debt, the numbers keep running up in this series. Pretty soon 
they'll need decimal points to keep track. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four meetings, the Rams have outscored Atlanta, 119-28. In the last 
three games, Bell is averaging 116 yards rushing and 5.3 yards a carry. Ellard 
has caught 18 passes for 325 yards. Pete Holohan has chipped in with 16 catches 
for 254 yards. You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
On their way to 4-0, the Rams have already beaten the Falcons once, 31-21, 
despite Deion Sanders' arm-waving, 68-yard punt return in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
So let's hear it, Atlanta, are the Rams for real? 
</P>
<P>
"I always said if they got there, it wouldn't surprise me," Coach Marion 
Campbell said. "I'm not trying to jinx them or anything like that. That's the 
way I feel about that football team. I'm not trying to make someone say they 
are and will be and all that, I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me if they 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
More bad news for Falcon followers: Atlanta has beaten the Rams once on the 
West Coast in the last 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Is there hope? 
</P>
<P>
Sanders should at least see more playing time today than last time, when he 
basically stepped off the plane and played against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie from Florida State has already proven a whiz as a kick returner -- 
he has taken back one punt for a score and had a 96-yard kickoff return called 
back last week -- but he hasn't been happy about his slow integration into the 
pass defense where, up to now, Sanders has been used only as a prevent safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I never sat on the bench for anyone in my whole life," Sanders complained. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Sanders came as close to pouting as a grown man could on a 
conference call. He even suggested that the Falcons switch him to offense. 
</P>
<P>
Really, Deion, where is your future in this league? 
</P>
<P>
"If I played, I'd say it was at cornerback," Sanders droned. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Neon Deion will get his wish against the Rams. The Falcons have 
finally worked him into their starting nickel unit and although he won't start 
ahead of Bobby Butler at the left corner, he will play some there, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, meanwhile, are trying to quiet the talk that comes with 4-0 starts 
and focus on the Falcons, though admittedly it's a wide scope. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said he isn't into pep talks anymore, suggesting that good 
teams don't have to be at emotional peaks every week to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I no longer deal with being up," Robinson said. "I think the championship 
teams have a way of not worrying about these things." 
</P>
<P>
So let this game between the Rams and Things begin. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Irv Pankey of the Rams is questionable for the game with a 
lower back problem. . . . The Falcons are also a bit scrambled on the offensive 
line. Veteran Mike Kenn is getting beat a lot at left tackle, which greatly 
concerns quarterback Chris Miller. Houston Hoover is starting at right tackle, 
despite a recent arrest for driving under the influence just north of Atlanta. 
Hoover was clocked at 104 m.p.h. in a 55 zone at 3:30 a.m. Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Miller will start today's game after missing last week's loss to Green Bay with 
bruised ribs. Former Ram Hugh Millen started in Miller's place and fared well, 
completing 20 of 28 passes for 294 yards in his debut as an NFL starter. . . . 
Greg Bell is the only back to have rushed for more than 100 yards against the 
Falcon defense this season. Three players who didn't are Herschel Walker, Eric 
Dickerson and Brent Fullwood. . . . Ram linebacker Frank Stams reported that 
his bruised thigh is feeling better. He is expected to play today. . . . So 
what, exactly, is Rams' fever? The game fell more than 18,000 tickets shy of 
selling out by 1 p.m. Thursday, meaning another local blackout.

WITH BO BACK, ALLEN DOESN'T WANT TO BE FULLBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson is expected to join the Raiders next week, meaning we'll see the 
famed twin-Heisman backfield with Marcus Allen at fullback, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Allen says he won't do it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of playing fullback," Allen has said. "I'll discuss it 
with the coaches if they have other ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Allen held out this summer and missed the entire exhibition season. When owner 
Al Davis refused to negotiate, Allen gave up and came into camp the week before 
the opener, but not happily. He is the leading Raider rusher, averaging 4.2 
yards a carry, and is second in receptions with 14. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two seasons, he has moved graciously to become a 205-pound fullback 
when Jackson arrived, even playing the position last season with a cast on his 
broken left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is tired of being beaten up but says it's more than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way," Allen said, "I'm not ready to be a role player yet. 
</P>
<P>
"My problem is, I've been such a nice guy. I've been trying to make everybody 
happy and I've been making myself miserable." 
</P>
<P>
And if new Coach Art Shell implores him to make the switch? 
</P>
<P>
"Art's my buddy," said Allen, laughing. "I don't know. Maybe we can talk." MARK 
HEISLER

THE OTHER GAMES

<P>
GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants (4-0) at Philadelphia (2-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's up to Buddy Ryan's Eagles to prevent an early runaway by the Giants, 
already ahead by two games in the NFC East. Philadelphia seemed to be the NFL's 
next dominant team and Randall Cunningham the next dominant quarterback until 
the Eagles suffered consecutive losses to San Francisco and Chicago. Phil Simms 
will try to find the holes others have exploited in the Philadelphia defense, 
which ranks last in the NFL. The Giants, trying to go 5-0 for the first time in 
48 years, beat the Eagles six consecutive games until Philadelphia won, 24-13 
and 23-17, last season. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo (3-1) at Indianapolis (2-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Colt defense has not given up a touchdown in the last two games, but was 
strafed by Jim Everett and Joe Montana earlier and could be overmatched against 
Jim Kelly, who has thrown eight touchdown passes in his last two games. These 
teams have split their AFC East series every season since 1984, Buffalo winning 
only once in five tries at the Hoosier Dome. Jack Trudeau replaced injured 
quarterback Chris Chandler and last week led the Colts past the New York Jets. 
Buffalo's defense isn't the same without injured linebacker Shane Conlan. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (3-1) at Pittsburgh (2-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals have beaten Pittsburgh three consecutive times, including a 41-10 
rout three weeks ago at Riverfront Stadium, but the Steelers don't figure to be 
such a pushover at home after two consecutive victories. Bubby Brister and 
Louis Lipps have gotten Pittsburgh rolling after scoring only 10 points in the 
first two games. Cincinnati quarterbacks Boomer Esiason and Turk Schonert both 
have leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (3-1) at Miami (1-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Kosar was the toast of Miami during his college days, but it's Dan 
Marino's town these days. The Browns can't run the ball -- Kosar was their 
leading rusher last week with 33 yards -- but they had enough firepower to hand 
Denver its first defeat on Matt Bahr's three field goals. Marino had the worst 
game of his career last week, passing for only 103 yards in a 39-7 loss to 
Houston. He led the Dolphins to a 38-31 victory over Cleveland last season, 
passing for 404 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (2-2) at Denver (3-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos could have taken total control of the AFC West had they held on to 
beat Cleveland last week. John Elway hasn't been himself yet but Bobby 
Humphrey's running has picked up the Broncos' offense. Jim McMahon has led the 
Chargers past Kansas City and Phoenix, but Denver's defense -- No. 1 against 
the run at 81 yards a game -- is awfully good. Denver has won five of six from 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (2-2) at New England (1-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Flutie wasn't the answer last week at Buffalo, but he is 10-0 at Sullivan 
Stadium -- 5-0 for Boston College, 5-0 for the Patriots -- so he may get the 
nod again over Tony Eason. The Oilers got their running game going last week 
with 197 yards -- 97 by Lorenzo White -- against Miami and rolled up 448 total 
yards. It may be easier against a New England defense weakened by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City (1-3) at Seattle (2-2), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
After two consecutive road victories, the Seahawks return to the Kingdome, 
where they have beaten the Chiefs six in a row. Kansas City is 1-14-1 on the 
road in the last two years. Dave Krieg riddled the Raider secondary on key 
plays last week, but Kansas City's pass defense is No. 2 in the NFL. The Chiefs 
have yet to given up 300 yards in a game and rookie linebacker Derrick Thomas 
has the look of a star. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Chicago (4-0) at Tampa Bay (2-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak just gets better and the Bear defense is playing the way it did in 
1985, despite giving up 401 yards passing to Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham 
-- 246 in a desperation fourth quarter. Chicago has beaten the Buccaneers 12 
consecutive times. Vinny Testaverde led Tampa Bay to only a field goal against 
Minnesota last week and it doesn't figure to be easier this week with Richard 
Dent in top sacking form. Tampa Bay's defense, the only unit in the NFL that 
hasn't given up more than 21 points in any game, could keep it close. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco (3-1) at New Orleans (1-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are back on the road, where they are 3-0 this season and 50-20-1 in 
the 1980s -- best in the NFL. San Francisco also is 15-2-1 after losses in 
recent seasons. Joe Montana finally got Roger Craig into the offense last week 
when the Rams held Jerry Rice to two catches, but the Saints' defense offers 
another challenge, especially with linebacker Rickey Jackson back. Dalton 
Hilliard has scored a touchdown in five consecutive games for the Saints. The 
49ers have won 13 of the last 17 from the Saints, including both last season. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (0-4) at Green Bay (2-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers, after rallying behind Don Majkowski from big deficits in the 
second half in the last four weeks, are as close to being 4-0 as they are to 
0-4. All four games have been decided by three points or fewer. The Cowboys, 
with rookie Steve Walsh replacing injured rookie Troy Aikman at quarterback, 
should find the going easier against a Green Bay defense, which has given up 
quarterbacks a 71% completion percentage. The Packers lead the NFL in passing 
and total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (0-4) at Minnesota (2-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions haven't won in eight games this season, including exhibitions, and it 
doesn't figure to happen this week. Rodney Peete was respectable in his first 
start at quarterback last week, but he could have used a healthy Barry Sanders, 
who has a hip injury and gained one yard in five carries. The Vikings will go 
with Tommy Kramer at quarterback. He led them to last week's victory over Tampa 
Bay after Wade Wilson suffered a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix (2-2) at Washington (2-2), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the Giants threatening an early breakaway in the NFC East, these teams are 
just battling to stay in the race. The Cardinals have lost two in a row after a 
surprising 2-0 start, but Gary Hogeboom hopes to find Roy Green and J. T. Smith 
running free in the Washington secondary, which ranks 23rd against the pass. 
The Redskins are relying on Gerald Riggs and the rushing game with young 
quarterback Mark Rypien still tentative at times. Washington has beaten the 
Cardinals 10 consecutive times in RFK Stadium.

It was just another one of those crazy Washington State-Oregon football games. 
</P>
<P>
In a series known for its high scores, another memorable chapter was written 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 21st-ranked Cougars beat the No. 23 Ducks, 51-38, in a Pacific 10 game that 
featured 905 yards total offense, a blocked punt for a touchdown, an 89-yard 
kickoff return and a line-drive kickoff that bounced off a stunned Washington 
State defensive lineman and was recovered by Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams averaged 67 points in their five previous meetings. Last year, 
Oregon won, 43-28. That was a defensive struggle compared with Saturday's 
contest, the second-highest scoring game in Autzen Stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
The highest was in 1984, when WSU's Rueben Mayes rushed for an NCAA-record 357 
yards in a 50-41 Cougar victory. That was the last time Washington State had 
beaten the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Broussard did a pretty good Mayes impersonation Saturday, rushing for a 
career-high 205 yards in 41 carries and scoring three touchdowns as the Cougars 
amassed 503 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars scored early on a blocked punt and jumped to a 20-6 halftime lead, 
then withstood a second-half rally and added 24 fourth-quarter points to 
improve their record to 5-1 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Ricard intercepted two passes by Bill Musgrave in the fourth quarter, 
returning one of them 74 yards for a score, to thwart the Ducks' comeback 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in front of 44,963, the second-largest crowd in Autzen's 22-year 
history, Musgrave completed 29 of 49 passes for a career-high 347 yards and two 
touchdowns. His passing yardage total was the fourth-best ever at Oregon. Only 
Dan Fouts and Chris Miller have done better. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the first time Oregon (3-2 and 2-2) has lost at home when 
Musgrave gone all the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars lost star receiver Tim Stallworth in the second quarter because of 
torn knee ligaments.

<P>
Top-ranked Notre Dame, playing away from home for the sixth time in its last 
seven games, found itself in even stranger territory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the third quarter, the Irish and Stanford were tied, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
But then Raghib (Rocket) Ismail went 66 yards on a kickoff return to set up the 
touchdown that sent Notre Dame on its way to its 17th consecutive victory, 
27-17. 
</P>
<P>
"When they tied it up and the stadium got involved, our team responded," Irish 
Coach Lou Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Especially Ismail, whose big return on the ensuing kickoff gave the Cardinal 
possession at the 16-yard line and quieted the crowd of 86,019. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford attempted to kick high and short of Ismail, but he raced up to handle 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I take it up the middle, I look for a crease," Ismail said. "Someone made 
a good block and I was able to cut to the right side." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford drove from the 16 to the one, from where Anthony Johnson went in to 
break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green said: "Any time you have a momentum swing, it 
changes the game." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, which outgained the Irish, 316 to 296, had pulled into the 14-14 tie 
when Steve Smith, who threw a school-record 68 passes and completed 39 of them 
for 282 yards, passed two yards to Ed McCaffrey for a touchdown and Tom Vardell 
ran for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said: "We came in wanting to win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Holtz: "These guys did what they had to do, and each week it gets tougher. 
But this was not one of our better performances, to be honest." 
</P>
<P>
Ismail had gone two weeks without handling a kickoff, since returning two for 
touchdowns against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
He got to handle one in the second quarter Saturday, but he was stopped by an 
unusual penalty against return mate Rodney Culver. 
</P>
<P>
Culver had signaled for a fair catch, so even though Ismail caught the ball, 
the officials blew a whistle when he started upfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish (5-0) had only one first down in the first quarter and were behind, 
6-0, against a team that allowed 40 points to San Jose State a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's embarrassed offense finally came to life in the second quarter, 
putting together a 64-yard drive that featured a 29-yard pass from Tony Rice to 
Ismail, and a 38-yard run by Rice. Johnson capped the drive with a seven-yard 
run. Notre Dame scored later in the second period on a two-yard run by Culver. 
</P>
<P>
It was 21-14 after Johnson's third-quarter score, and Notre Dame increased its 
lead to 24-14 on Craig Hentrich's 20-yard field goal early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (1-4) was behind only 24-17 when a pass by Smith was intercepted by 
safety Pat Terrell, whose return set up an 18-yard field goal.

PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP;

<P>
GOAL-LINE FUMBLE SAVES CAL, 26-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A goal-line fumble by San Jose State tailback Sheldon Canley in the fourth 
quarter preserved California's 26-21 victory Saturday in a nonconference game 
at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans had driven to Cal's one-yard-line on a fourth-quarter drive given 
renewed life in a fourth-down situation when punter Jim Hughes faked the kick 
and threw a 31-yard first-down pass. 
</P>
<P>
But with San Jose State poised to take the lead, Cal linebacker David Ortega 
stripped the ball from Canley as he was crossing into the end zone and 
cornerback Doug Parrish recovered the fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The victory margin came courtesy of a 50-yard Robbie Keen field goal and a 
safety -- Cal's first in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
The safety was a result of three consecutive sacks in the waning minutes of the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Danny Slevin sacked San Jose State's Matt Veatch for a loss of nine 
yards, pushing the Spartans back to their 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, linebacker Cornell Collier got Veatch for six more yards, and 
on the play in which Cal got the safety, it was Collier again, catching Veatch 
in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears are 2-3. San Jose State, which beat Stanford a week earlier, is 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal defense gave up 406 yards of total offense. But the Spartans lost three 
fumbles and had five penalties, including an offensive pass interference call 
that negated a 48-yard play in the game's final minute and ended San Jose 
State's final threat. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State 35, Oregon State 18 -- Sophomore quarterback Mark Barsotti ran for 
two touchdowns and passed for another to lead the undefeated Bulldogs of the 
Big West Conference past the Beavers at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Barsotti scored on a one-yard run in the first quarter and then completed an 
88-yard touchdown pass to Dwight Pickens early in the second quarter as Fresno 
pulled ahead, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno (5-0) scored again on a two-yard run by Myron Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (2-3) cut the margin to 21-6 at halftime on field goals of 43 and 
21 yards by Troy Bussanich. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Chaffey's one-yard scoring run early in the third quarter got Oregon State 
within nine points, but Fresno State sealed the victory with a pair of 
time-consuming drives. 
</P>
<P>
Jones scored on a one-yard run to cap off a 75-yard drive, and Barsotti had a 
one-yard touchdown run to finish an 84-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
"The two main possessions we had in the second half were awesome drives," 
Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State has won 12 consecutive games since a 21-10 loss to Oregon State 
last year at Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Booher had to replace Oregon State starting quarter Nick Schichtle, who 
bruised his shoulder on the Beavers' second offensive play. Booher had 85 yards 
rushing and 136 passing.

<TEXT>
<P>
Alex Van Pelt threw for 181 yards and three touchdowns, and eighth-ranked 
Pittsburgh took advantage of six Temple turnovers for a 27-3 victory Saturday 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt threw touchdown passes to Henry Tuten and Reggie Williams in a shaky 
first half. Pitt (4-0-1) had three interceptions, two by Robert Bradley, and 
three fumble recoveries to spoil Temple's homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt also threw a fourth-down, one-yard touchdown pass to Tom Huebner with 
5:27 to play after Huebner recovered a fumbled punt on the Temple 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Temple (0-6) took a 3-0 lead when Bob Wright kicked a 24-yard field goal with 
8:05 left in the first quarter. But mistakes ended key opportunities for the 
Owls, who have not scored a touchdown in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley intercepted a pass by Victor Lay and returned it to the Temple 44 to 
set up Pittsburgh's first score. Tuten made a diving catch of Van Pelt's pass 
in the end zone for a 7-3 lead with 2:22 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Van Pelt threw a 38-yard pass to Williams to give the Panthers a 14-3 lead with 
10:27 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-yard pass from Van Pelt to Tuten set up a 30-yard field goal by Frazier 
and a 17-3 halftime lead as time ran out. Frazier kicked a 32-yarder in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force 35, Navy 7 -- Quarterback Dee Dowis threw two touchdown passes to 
Steve Senn as the Falcons won their seventh in a row against the Midshipmen at

Falcons improved to 6-0 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State 17, Rutgers 0 -- The Nittany Lions shut down the Scarlet Knights' 
offense at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the fourth in a row for Penn State (4-1). It's the Lions' longest 
winning streak since 1987 and the shutout also was the first since a 41-0 
victory over Cincinnati the same year. Rutgers dropped to 2-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Penn 24, Columbia 21 -- Bryan Keys' scored two touchdowns, including a one-yard

GADDIS' 274 YARDS, 3 SCORES LEAD SOONERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Gaddis ran for 274 yards and three touchdowns, leading No. 16 Oklahoma to 
a 37-15 victory over Oklahoma State Saturday at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Gaddis, who had 213 yards against Oklahoma State last season as a freshman, 
carried 29 times and scored on runs of 24, 80 and four yards. It was the 
third-best rushing day in school history, 20 yards fewer than Greg Pruitt's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The game was a matchup of teams on National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
probation. The NCAA put Oklahoma on three years' probation in December, and 
handed Oklahoma State a four-year probation a month later. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners improved to 4-1 overall, 2-0 in the Big Eight. Oklahoma State is 
1-4 and 0-1 after losing to Oklahoma for the 13th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-yard touchdown run by Gaddis late in the third quarter gave the Sooners 
a 20-15 lead. His score came two plays after Cary Blanchard had kicked his 
third field goal of the quarter, a 52-yarder that pulled the Cowboys to 23-15. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners recovered a fumble by Mike Gundy at the Oklahoma State 22-yard line 
in the fourth quarter to set up Gaddis' final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy became the Big Eight's career passing leader by throwing for 160 yards, 
although he completed only 13 of 32. He has thrown for 6,490 yards, surpassing 
the record of 6,410 by Frank Seuer of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado 49, Missouri 3 -- Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan ran for three 
touchdowns and accounted for 262 yards of total offense before leaving the game 
late in the first half, leading the third-ranked Buffaloes to the victory at 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan, a former standout at Locke High School, scored on runs of nine, two and 
eight yards before the game was 10 minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes (5-0) rolled to a 35-0 lead at halftime, generating 401 total 
yards to just 53 for Missouri (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
Hagan's initial score came on the game's second play from scrimmage. On the 
first, Hagan hit Jeff Campbell on a 58-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
On their next possession, the Buffaloes went 90 yards in 11 plays. Hagan ran 22 
yards to start the drive and capped it with a two-yard sprint. His third score 
was an eight-yard run with 5:07 to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska 58, Kansas State 7 -- Ken Clark, Bryan Carpenter and Jon Bostick each 
scored two touchdowns as the fourth-ranked Cornhuskers rolled in their 
conference opener at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskers (5-0) had touchdown passes from three quarterbacks and totaled 723 
yards offense. The yardage total was Nebraska's fifth best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska had 444 yards in total offense by halftime, rolling to a 35-0 lead. 
Clark had 116 yards rushing and a two-yard touchdown run by halftime and 
finished with 166 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Clark moved into fourth place on the Nebraska list, ahead of Rick Berns and 
Roger Craig. Clark, with 2,464 total yards, trails Heisman Trophy winner Mike 
Rozier (4,780), I.M. Hipp (2,814) and Keith Jones (2,488). 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State is 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa St. 24, Kansas 20 -- Blaise Bryant, the nation's second-leading rusher, 
ran for 126 yards and cornerback Marcus Robertson delivered two key plays as 
the Cyclones won their conference opener at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant scored on a 30-yard touchdown run, giving Iowa State (3-2) a 17-14 lead 
late in the second quarter. Kansas dropped to 2-4.

</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara (3-2) took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter when Armstrong 
threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Brian Fleming and a nine-yard score to Khaleb 
Shahbo.

CS LONG BEACH FINALLY STOPS NEW MEXICO ST., GOES ON TO WIN, 55-48 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it seemed neither team would stop the other, Cal State Long Beach got 
some defense and escaped with a 55-48 Big West Conference victory over winless 
New Mexico State Saturday at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It took a late touchdown on an interception by Pepper Jenkins for the 49ers to 
stave off the Aggies, who rolled up 634 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The wild game at Veterans Stadium may have had more yards than fans. There were 
1,100 yards in total offense. There was a crowd estimated at 1,000, although 
Long Beach officials said the attendance was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, 3-3 overall and 1-2 in the Big West, had to overcome a 21-0 lead to 
avoid losing to a team that hasn't won a conference game in three years. New 
Mexico State (0-5, 0-2) has lost 11 consecutive games over two seasons and 22 
in a row in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a group work so hard to be rewarded so little," Aggie Coach 
Mike Knoll said. "They know success is right around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies trailed, 48-45, and were driving late in the fourth quarter when 
Jenkins intercepted Phil Vinson's pass, which was tipped by defensive end 
Richard Hensley, and ran 51 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Before that the 49ers had little success against Vinson, who completed 25 
passes for 405 yards and three touchdowns, or fullback Anthony Singleton, who 
rushed for 137 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept coming to the sidelines, saying, 'It's gonna change, it's gonna 
change,' " Jenkins said. "That interception changed it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were unstoppable in the third quarter. New Mexico State drove 80 
yards to build a 35-21 lead. Long Beach drove 90 yards for a touchdown. The 
Aggies then drove 85 for another touchdown. The 49ers answered by going 62 
yards in a little more than a minute, scoring on a 50-yard pass play from Paul 
Oates to Sean Foster. 
</P>
<P>
After forcing the Aggies to punt, the 49ers tied the game, 42-42, on a 10-yard 
run by Freddie Leslie. Only 15 seconds later, after an interception by Marc 
Tourville, Foster made a leaping catch in the end zone of Oates' 27-yard pass 
to put the 49ers ahead, 48-42. 
</P>
<P>
The 41 points in the third quarter were one fewer than what the teams combined 
for in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Oates passed for 270 yards and four touchdowns, Foster caught seven passes for 
130 yards and tailback Jeff Fassett ran for 133 yards, including one of 57 in 
the second quarter that gave the 49ers their first touchdown.

State racing steward C.L. Webb said a blood test after the race showed 9.3

The Union of European Football Associations announced sanctions against more 
than 50 European soccer clubs and players for misconduct in recent European 
Club matches. 
</P>
<P>
The stiffest of $135,800 in fines was given Partizan Belgrade -- $21,600, for 
incidents during its Cup of Cupwinners match against visiting Celtic Glasgow 
Sept. 12. Fines of $15,430 each were levied on Feyenoord Rotterdam (UEFA Cup 
game against VFB Stuttgart Sept. 13), Olympiakos Pireus (UEFA Cup game against 
Rad Belgrade Sept. 28) and SSC Naples (UEFA Cup game against Sporting Portugal

The Lakers replaced their retired captain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with three 
players after an informal polling of veterans Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, Michael Cooper and James Worthy will share the honor this 
season, meaning they will rotate tasks of arguing with officials, enforcing 
internal team policy and arguing with officials some more. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody just wanted it individually," Johnson said after the Lakers' morning 
practice at the University of Hawaii. "Everybody wanted somebody else. I voted 
for them (Cooper and Worthy), but then everybody said, 'No, you've got to be 
it.' So, we all just sort of decided to do it this way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to make a difference to me. I'm still the leader. I have been. 
I've been arguing with the refs for years. But Coop deserves a piece of (the 
job), and so does James." 
</P>

FUTURE OF SENIOR TOUR BRIGHT, SAYS CASPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Billy Casper looks at it, when Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino join the 
senior tour in a few months and others such as Raymond Floyd, Dave Stockton and 
Tom Weiskopf when they turn 50 in a couple of years, the regular PGA Tour may 
become a steppingstone to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to call (the regular tour) the minor leagues," Casper said, 
jokingly, "but it'll be where we get our new talent, sort of the way pro 
football does from the colleges." 
</P>
<P>
And, asks the two-time United States Open and one-time U.S. Senior Open 
champion, who would the public rather see: Nicklaus, Trevino, Arnold Palmer, 
Gary Player and Chi Chi Rodriguez, or Payne Stewart, Tom Kite, Mark 
Calcavecchia, Steve Jones and Paul Azinger, the top five U.S. money winners 
this season? 
</P>
<P>
Casper, 58, has been on the senior tour since its second season and has seen it 
grow from two tournaments with a $250,000 payout to 41 tournaments with $19 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"With Jack and Lee coming in, it can't help but get better, and better and 
better," he said. "We've already seen some results. Cadillac has signed up as 
sponsor of 14 of our tournaments next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee says he expects to play in about 30 tournaments a year, and we feel if 
Jack plays in 10, it will be a tremendous asset to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, who will be 50 on Jan. 21, will make his debut Jan. 27-28 in the 
Senior Skins Game at Mauna Lani Resort in Hawaii. He will play with Trevino, 
Palmer and Player. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised to see Nicklaus play even more, once he gets with us 
and sees how much fun we have," Casper said. "It's a totally different 
atmosphere from the regular tour, which is so businesslike. I'm having the time 
of my life. Everywhere we go, we're treated like royalty, like we're kings of 
the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Casper is in town to participate in his 15th annual charity tournament Monday 
at Anaheim Hills Golf Club for the Brigham Young University athletic fund and 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints missionary fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the golf pros who do charity events are paid a gratuity, but Billy has 
never taken a dime in the 15 years," said Lupi Saldana, the tournament founder 
and co-chairman this year with Dean Alger. "And he's come back every year, no 
matter what he's been doing on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
The tournament will be a best-ball scrambles for $125, which includes a clinic 
by Casper and an awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I may enter my own team this year," Casper said. "It'll be four of my sons, 
Billy, 33; Bobby, 29; Byron, 21, and Charles, 19." 
</P>
<P>
Casper also does a similar event in Silver City, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
"Silver City is where I learned to play golf, on my grandfather's farm, so I go 
back there for Billy Casper Day and give a clinic and take part in a charity 
for the local hospitals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Casper, who still has seven children living at home with him and his wife 
Shirley, recently moved to his old neighborhood in Bonita, in San Diego County, 
after spending more than 20 years in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that if I continue to play while growing older, I needed to be in the 
sunlight more," he said. "In Utah, there are a lot of months where you don't 
get to play. But the way the senior tour is going, I need to keep warm all year 
long so I'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Casper won the U.S. Open in 1959, when he was 28, and again in 1966. He won the 
Senior Open in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm often asked how I compare them and I'm not kidding when I say it was just 
as satisfying to win the Senior Open as it was the U.S. Open, maybe more so," 
he said. "Each tournament I win, now that I'm approaching 60, I realize I don't 
have that many more wins in me. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in your 20s and you win, you think you'll keep on winning forever, 
so I think you appreciate winning more when you're in your 50s." 
</P>
<P>
Casper didn't waste time jumping into the senior pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned 50 on a Wednesday (June 24, 1981) and played in the pro-am Thursday 
and teed it up as a card-carrying senior on Friday. I think most of the fellows 
have that same attitude, especially now that the tour has grown beyond anyone's 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino will turn 50 on Dec. 1, which means he will miss playing in the GTE 
tournament at Ojai Valley by one day. That tournament starts Nov. 30. Trevino 
is expected to shoot for his first senior paycheck Dec. 5-9 in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Casper says that most of the sponsors and pro-am partners are about the same 
age as the senior players, so it is easier to closely associate with them than 
with the mass of younger, lesser known performers. And that, he adds, is 
largely responsible for the success of the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
"When the seniors started, many people were skeptical of the playing ability of 
men 50 years old and older, but I think in the nine years we've been playing 
that we have shown we can still play very good golf," he said. "That is not 
true in most sports where the age factor is easily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have the super seniors for fellows 60 and older, like Sam (Snead) and 
Charlie Sifford and Jerry Barber. In two years I'll be eligible for the supers 
and I'm already looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing more tournaments than I did when I was in my 20s and 30s, and I'm 
having the time of my life. What more can I ask?" 
</P>
<P>

With most of a $100,000 purse to be awarded today, the NEC World Cycling 
Invitational looks like a three-team race between the United States, the Soviet 
Union and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, behind Viacheslav Ekimov, took over first place among the eight 
teams with 56 points. The United States, behind Janie Eickhoff, moved into 
second with 53 points, and Italy won Saturday's last event to stay close with 
52. 
</P>
<P>
Ekimov, the three-time world pursuit champion, treated the crowd at the Olympic 
Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills to the day's most impressive victory. 
Going against Pascal Potie of France in a 12-lap (4,000-kilometer) race, Ekimov 
lapped his opponent on their 10th circuit and posted a time of 4 minutes 36.51 
seconds, almost 19 seconds ahead of the next-best time. 
</P>
<P>
Eickhoff, 19, of Los Alamitos, who attends Cal State Dominguez Hills, kept the 
United States in contention, winning both the tempo and elimination races and 
posting her best time in the 3,000-meter pursuit (3:59.22). 
</P>
<P>
America's veteran sprinter, Connie Paraskevin-Young, was eliminated in the 
women's sprint semifinals by France's Isabelle Gautheron after two 
down-to-the-wire heats. When they last met a year ago at Seoul, Young edged 
Gautheron for the Olympic bronze medal. The Soviets' Erika Salumayae also 
advanced to today's sprint final in straight heats. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's match sprints, Ken Carpenter of the United States defeated Italy's 
Fedrico Paris to reach today's semifinals with Canada's Curt Harnett, who had a 
surprisingly easy time against Nikolai Kovsch of the Soviet Union, Gary Neiwand 
of Australia and Frederick Magne of France. 
</P>
<P>
Today's final session begins at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not ride, Saturday's star was Tour de France winner Greg 
LeMond. Of his new-found celebrity, he said, "When I went to the White House 
the first time I won (the Tour de France) in 1986, I was rushed in, they took 
pictures, and I was rushed out. This year, all the Secret Service men were 
cyclists."

HAMMOND BEATS DARKNESS TO LEAD

Donnie Hammond, battling darkness and a couple of erratic Ryder Cup stars, shot 
a five-under-par 65 Saturday and took a two-stroke lead in the rain-delayed 
third round of the $600,000 Texas Open golf tournament at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, who last won in the 1986 Bob Hope Classic, parred the final hole for a 
54-hole total of 16-under-par 194 on the short Oak Hills Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond and Ryder Cup competitor Paul Azinger, playing in the final twosome, 
defied all odds by completing the round, which was delayed nearly three hours 
by an early-morning downpour. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond fashioned a two-shot advantage over Azinger, veteran Bob Lohr and 
former UCLA star Duffy Waldorf. Azinger matched par-70 while Waldorf and Lohr 
carded 66s. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, a winner at Hartford this year, started the third round with a 
three-shot lead, squandered it with a 38 going out, then bounced back with an 
eagle-3 at the par-5 10th hole and a birdie at the 11th before finishing with 
seven straight pars. 
</P>
<P>
Lanny Wadkins, Azinger's Ryder Cup teammate, was equally as erratic, slipping 
in and out of the lead several times before a double bogey at the 15th dropped 
him to 13-under and torpedoed his round. 
</P>

A bogey at the 18th added insult to Wadkins' injury and a 68 left him tied with 
Tom Sieckmann at 198. Sieckmann had a 67.

Rives McBee capped a wild finish with a chip-in birdie to take a one-stroke 
lead over Gary Player after two rounds of the $1.5-million RJR Championship for 
seniors at Clemmons, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
McBee, a rookie on the Seniors PGA Tour, managed a three-under-par 67 despite a 
double bogey on the 17th hole and completed two trips over the revamped 
Tanglewood Park course in 135. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't deserve the double bogey on he 17th, but I didn't deserve the birdie 
on the 18th either," McBee said. "I'm tickled to death to be where I am." 
</P>
<P>
Player, a two-stroke leader when the day's play started, shot a 71 including 
bogeys on the final two holes. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dalziel, who had a 69, was the only other man in the field able to break 
par for two trips over the 18 new putting surfaces that frustrated and 
infuriated the 72-man field. 
</P>
<P>
Dalziel was at 139, one under. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hill, who finished second and third in the last two years when this 
tournament was known as the Vantage Championship, matched par for the second 
day in a row and was at 140.

<P>
He shot 70 for a 10-under-par total of 206, two strokes ahead of defending 
champion Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain, who shot a 69, and tournament 
co-promoter Bernhard Langer, who had a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Second-round leader Nick Faldo of Britain shot 40 on the front nine and 
finished with a 74 and a share of fourth place at 209 with Australian Rodger 
Davis, 72.

ENCOURAGED INVESTORS PUTTING STOCK BACK INTO COSTLY PRODUCTIONS

For 10 years, says Tommy Tune, he had a recurring dream. He was standing in a 
ballroom with a shiny floor, a chandelier and lots of gold chairs with red 
velvet cushions. If it had been a musical, it would be just the place for a 
song and dance. But then he would wake up. 
</P>
<P>
Then one Christmas he received a copy of "Grand Hotel," Vicki Baum's 1929 novel 
about Germany in the late '20s. He liked it so much that he rented the 
Oscar-winning 1932 film, which he didn't like as much. But his interest was 
piqued enough that he decided to meet with Robert Wright and George Forrest, 
who worked together on "Kismet," about their musical based on Baum's book. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Hotel" opens on Broadway on Nov. 12 and will be virtually a dream come 
true for Tune, who has directed and choreographed the production. The lavishly 
mounted show will have a ballroom with a shiny floor, a chandelier and plenty 
of plush chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hotel," which finished its pre-Broadway run last night in Boston, is just one 
of several new, American-mounted musicals hoping to wrest the dominance of the 
musical theater back from the British. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Andrew Lloyd Webber's newest hit musical, "Aspects of Love," 
playing in London, will land on Broadway next April. Or that it will certainly 
be followed by "Miss Saigon," another new musical from the team that wrote "Les 
Miserables," and which just opened in London to raves -- and an $8 million 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
Make way for the return of the home-grown musical. "This is truly the great 
American art form," insists "Grand Hotel" producer Martin Richards. "I'm a 
little bored with Englishmen taking all the Tonys away. Maybe this season we'll 
show them we're all here." 
</P>
<P>
Rehearsal halls are jumping, costume shops are swamped and theaters are booked 
far into the season. More musicals are set to open between now and year-end 
than opened during the entire 88-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
Musicals, explains Shubert Organization president Bernard Jacobs, "are popular, 
productive of better earnings and producers like to do them." So, in addition 
to presenting stars like Dustin Hoffman in Shakespeare and Vanessa Redgrave in 
Tennessee Williams, this season's producers are back to risking millions on 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"Last season was terrible," says producer Nick Vanoff, a backer of the Cy 
Coleman/Larry Gelbart musical comedy thriller "City of Angels" now in rehearsal 
here. "We thought we'd have one of the few musicals this season. But now 
there's a real theater jam." 
</P>
<P>
Sting's highly publicized Broadway debut in "Three Penny Opera" is set for Nov. 
5, and a new production of "Gypsy" starring Tyne Daly opens Nov. 16. The late 
Hugh Wheeler's take on "Meet Me in St. Louis," based on both the 1943 MGM film 
and a series of New Yorker articles, opens Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Graciela Daniele's dance drama "Dangerous Games" opens Oct. 19, and a musical 
based on Evan Rhodes' best-selling novel, "The Prince of Central Park," is 
scheduled for Oct. 30. The recently opened chamber version of Stephen Sondheim 
and Wheeler's "Sweeney Todd" is already getting excellent notices at the small 
Circle in the Square. 
</P>
<P>
"Things go in cycles," says Jules Fisher, lighting designer on "Grand Hotel" 
and a producer of "Dangerous Games." "Money was much harder to raise because a 
number of investors lost a lot of money. There was the stock market crash of 
'87 and new tax laws. And inflation made it extremely expensive to do a 
musical." 
</P>
<P>
So what changed? At Jujamcyn Theaters, which will house "City of Angels," 
"Grand Hotel" and "Gypsy," president Rocco Landesman indirectly thanks British 
mega-producer Cameron Mackintosh. " 'Les Miserables' and 'Phantom of the Opera' 
have been a big boost to the whole industry," says Landesman. "People now 
perceive that it's not a hopeless proposition and that if you have a big hit, 
you can make a lot of money. That's encouraged investors. No doubt about it. 
And the economy is pretty good. That always helps." 
</P>
<P>
As Tune's "Grand Hotel" experience indicates, ideas for musicals come from 
everywhere -- and often take a while to materialize on Broadway. "At the 
Grand," a very different project from the same writers and composers, 
originally debuted at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera back in 1958, but never 
made it to Broadway. Author Rhodes, finally in rehearsal on "Prince of Central 
Park," says it took nearly eight years before the right Broadway production 
team finally came along. 
</P>
<P>
"These people never stopped working or thinking or collaborating," says 
Richards. "It isn't exactly done like a Xerox machine or a computer. It takes a 
while." Shrugs composer Coleman, who worked with Gelbart for years on "City of 
Angels": "They happen when they happen." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows which, if any, of this year's musicals will survive the critics, 
much less become another "A Chorus Line" or "Phantom." "We hope and pray 
they'll all be huge smash hits because we want our people to work," says John 
Glasel, president of the American Federation of Musicians Local 802. "We want 
boffo box office." 
</P>
<P>
So do producers. With musicals averaging $4 million apiece -- and shows like 
"Phantom" and "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" running double that amount -- plenty's 
at stake. Last season, for instance, producers lost "every penny" of "Carrie's" 
$7-million cost "and then some," says Landesman. "It was like when a car gets 
totaled -- that's what happened to 'Carrie.' " 
</P>
<P>
As a result, producers hedge their bets in several ways. Revivals abound in 
musicals as well as plays, and aside from "City of Angels," all of the musicals 
opening the next few months have had another life before Broadway. And if there 
aren't stars like Daly or Sting onstage, there are such big names backstage as 
choreographer Tune, playwright Gelbart and composer Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Producers are holding down costs -- and, presumably, risks -- however they can. 
Daly and "Gypsy" will have played 14 cities, including Los Angeles last July, 
by the time the production hits New York. "Prince of Central Park" originated 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous Games" was both begun and developed in assorted non-profit theaters 
around the country -- including the La Jolla Playhouse. Producer Fisher thinks 
that's how it should be. "Nowadays, shows can open any way possible, and we 
should have that creative freedom to try venues. With so much money at stake, 
you have to have another opportunity before you plunk it down on Broadway and a 
very few critics determine its fate." 
</P>
<P>
Other shows have more traditional pre-Broadway tryouts. "Grand Hotel" ended its 
Boston run last night en route to New York, and "Three Penny Opera" ends its 
Washington tryout today. Says observer Paul Libin, producing director at Circle 
in the Square: "If you go to New York cold, you sit here with all the wise guys 
telling you what's wrong. You want to shake down a new show." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the early '70s, when producer Barry Brown was rounding up cash to 
produce "Gypsy" in London with Angela Lansbury, "people were still investing in 
the theater as much for glamour and excitement as for making money. If you were 
investing $500 or $1,000, it wasn't the end of the earth if you lost it. With 
the smallest investment today $60,000 to $100,000, the day of the small 
investor is over. Nobody is going to invest in a (Broadway musical) for the 
glamour anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Those jumbo price tags also make institutional money very attractive. Besides 
individuals and corporations -- both domestic and foreign -- it's also rare 
today that producer credits don't carry a theater owner's name like Shubert, 
Nederlander or Jujamcyn above the title. 
</P>
<P>
When James Nederlander brought in $2.5 million on "La Cage aux Folles," says 
Brown, he immediately got producer billing. "Billing is the cheapest thing to 
give away because it isn't going to cost me anything. If somebody says, 'I want 
producer billing and I'll give you half a million,' I say, 'Welcome to the 
family.' " 
</P>
<P>
Producers also make money once the shows leave Broadway. The Stephen 
Sondheim/James Lapine hit musical "Into the Woods," for instance, recently 
closed on Broadway after 23 months with one U.S. tour under way and a second 
planned for dozens of one-night markets. Productions are being discussed for 
Australia, Japan and London, and so is its "movie manifestation." "One has to 
look at New York as the beginning of the process, not the end," says Michael 
David at the show's general manager, Dodger Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Complemented by such off-Broadway fare as George Abbott's "Frankie," a musical 
about Frankenstein also expected before year-end, Broadway's musical beat goes 
on. Ads are appearing for "Annie 2," Lincoln Center Theatre may bring back 
"Guys and Dolls" and they're talking musicals of films from "Arthur" to "Sheila 
Levine is Dead and Living in New York." Producers are putting together Broadway 
musicals based on the lives of everyone from Hoagy Carmichael and Will Rogers 
to the Rev. Martin Luther King and Jimmy Durante. 
</P>
<P>
Already, in fact, there's a holding pattern for productions waiting to land on 
Broadway. "Durante," a $4-million musical about the comedian that began in 
Toronto, opens Nov. 1 at the Shubert in Los Angeles for "a minimum of three 
weeks" as part of its pre-Broadway run. "All the musical houses are either 
occupied by long-term hits or have been committed to other new projects," says 
the production's general manager Frank Scardino. "If a theater opened up 
between now and Nov. 1, there's every possibility we could go to New York 
directly from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, when you're waiting for a show to come in, you're in fact 
waiting for somebody else to close. You don't wish that, but the historical 
fact is that not every show makes it," says Scardino. "The likelihood of a 
musical house becoming available by the first of the year, or maybe before, is 
probable given past seasons." 
</P>
<P>
But at this point, says Jujamcyn's Landesman, "everyone's very hopeful. It's a 
little like the baseball teams going into spring training. Every team thinks it 
has a great chance to win the pennant. Just ask again around July 4."Tommy Tune

BACKSTAGE AT FIVE NEW SHOWS;

HOW A STING ALBUM LED HELLMAN TO REVIVAL OF 'THREE PENNY OPERA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Hellman, the Academy Award-winning producer of such films as "Coming 
Home" and "Midnight Cowboy," traces his new venture as theater producer back to 
an evening when he and his wife, photographer Nancy Ellison, were listening to 
Sting's album ". . . Nothing Like the Sun." They started talking about what a 
terrific Mack the Knife the rock star would make in "Three Penny Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Hellman, 60, had seen the Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill classic a few times in the 
'50s and was intrigued enough to pick up the original cast album. "It wasn't a 
great recording, but it was enough to get me interested." 
</P>
<P>
He then set about getting the rights, which took several months, and making 
sure that his friend and Malibu neighbor Sting would do it. "If Sting said, 
'No,' I might have looked elsewhere, but he didn't. He said, 'If you can put it 
together, I'm interested.' " 
</P>
<P>
What enticed Sting to do it? "I think Sting made an intelligent assessment of 
his own career. He's maturing and I don't think he wants to play to screaming 
teen-agers as he gets into his 40s. He's an artist with serious intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Early on, says Hellman, they considered larger venues than a Broadway house, 
"but it didn't feel right. And I felt one of the biggest dangers would be to 
overproduce it, to turn it into something it shouldn't be. It demands a 
closeness with the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Feingold, who adapted "Happy End," "wanted a shot at this, did lyrics 
on four numbers and sent them to me on spec. I felt he had a point of view on 
the period and passed them on to Sting who liked them. (The show's director) 
John Dexter said fine." 
</P>
<P>
Hellman declines revealing the exact size of his show's capitalization. He 
carried it himself during the initial stages, he says, then brought in Japanese 
publisher and film producer Haruki Kadokawa and theater owner James 
Nederlander. "I had my choice of theaters and managements. My terms were clear. 
I retained absolute and full control so the director and I could work as I do 
on films -- one shared vision without which you're lost." 
</P>
<P>
The next step was its Broadway tryout in Washington, D.C., which ends today. 
"Three Penny" opened on Sept. 14 there, and the reviews were terrible. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Post critic David Richards called the production "slow and turgid 
stuff . . . The very qualities that made the Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill piece 
such a sensation in 1928 -- its bristling humor, its accusatory anger, its 
sullen impudence -- remain pretty much locked up inside this lumbering 
production." 
</P>
<P>
What was Hellman's reaction? "They were any sane person's reaction -- concern 
and 
</P>
<P>
back to work with a vengeance," he said by phone from Washington. "The show 
that was reviewed was the sixth time it was performed for an audience and the 
sixth time Sting had appeared on any venue in this kind of format. It's the 
equivalent of taking your rough cut and having a world premiere of it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was and is a work in progress," continues Hellman. "The jolt of the reviews 
made it easier for all of us to become appropriately critical and bear down. 
I'm not suggesting that bad reviews feel as good as good reviews, but sometimes 
they serve a constructive purpose and this was one of those times." 
</P>
<P>
 "Three Penny Opera" opens at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, 205 W. 46th St., on 
Sunday, Nov. 5. Previews begin Oct. 19. Tickets for Tuesday through Saturday 
evenings and weekend matinees are $42.50, $50 and $55. Wednesday matinee 
tickets are $35, $42.50 and $47.50. 
</P>
<P>
Tyne Daly Sings and One Producer Is Inspired to Bring Back 'Gypsy' 
</P>
<P>
Barry Brown was nestled in his living room overlooking Central Park, idly 
switching TV channels, when he came upon Tyne Daly singing on Dolly Parton's 
variety show, "Dolly." "I was mesmerized," says producer Brown. "I knew what an 
incredible actress she was, but I didn't know she could sing. I turned to a 
friend and said, 'I think I just got an idea.' " 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Brown had called Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for the 
musical "Gypsy." What did Laurents think about putting the Emmy-winning actress 
onstage as Mama Rose in a 30th anniversary production of the show? 
</P>
<P>
Laurents suggested that he bring her to New York for an audition so he, "Gypsy" 
composer Jule Styne and lyricist Stephen Sondheim could hear her sing. Brown 
called Daly's agent to see if the actress was even interested. She was. 
Everybody got together several weeks later at the Imperial Theatre, where Daly 
sang several of Rose's songs from the show. When she asked if they wanted to 
hear another, "Steve turned to Arthur and Jule and asked, 'Do we need to hear 
more?' They both said 'No' and Steve said, "Let's get started." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the show "the King Lear of musicals," Brown says director Laurents 
insisted that the lead had to play for a lengthy time on the road. Further 
encouraged by Daly's star status, Brown and his co-producers preceded the 
show's Broadway opening with a six-month, 14-city national tour. The tour, 
which included a stop at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in July, sent back 
reviews loaded with words like "fabulous," "magnificent" and "astonishing." 
</P>
<P>
The national tour was also quite lucrative and Brown says the production is 
already "well on the way to recoupment. If we play to 80% of capacity, we could 
pay off in 30 to 35 weeks on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
When Brown and his late partner Fritz Holt produced "Gypsy" with Angela 
Lansbury in London in 1973, says Brown, it cost $275,000 -- including all 
airfare and per diems. This production will cost $3 million to mount, he says. 
The number is low for Broadway, he says, given that both Laurents and producers 
kept costs down. Costumes, he says, could have cost $500,000 to $700,000, but 
came in for under $300,000, and sets could have come in for $1 million and came 
in for half that. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also has big plans for both Daly and "Gypsy." He hopes the longtime TV 
cop will stay with the show through summer 1990, take some time off, then open 
that fall in London "where 'Cagney &amp; Lacey' is a big show and she's a 
star." 
</P>
<P>
Back at home, Brown wants to do unto "Gypsy" what producer David Merrick did 
unto "Hello, Dolly," succeeding Carol Channing with several other stars. Names 
that he says have been discussed include, "in alphabetical order," Carol 
Burnett, Bette Midler, Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters. "All would be good 
and each would be very different, not only from each other but from Tyne." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gypsy" opens at the St. James Theatre, 246 W. 44th St., on Nov. 16. Previews 
begin Oct. 27. Tickets for Tuesday through Saturday evenings and weekend 
matinees are $25, $45, $50. Wednesday matinee tickets are $20, $40 and $45. 
</P>
<P>
It Takes a Lot of Money Just to Open a 'Grand Hotel' 
</P>
<P>
The run-through of Tommy Tune's "Grand Hotel," sans set and costumes, had just 
ended when producer Martin Richards leaned over to point out assorted investors 
in the small, invited audience. "I never had this luxury with any other 
director," he whispers to a reporter. "It's like introducing your child without 
having it properly clothed." 
</P>
<P>
The fact the child's there at all is an "incredible feat," Richards adds. "Two 
months ago, we decided to do a workshop as a test. After two weeks, Tommy 
decided he wanted to do it. No SEC papers had been filed, nothing, but Tommy 
felt let's do it -- the energy and excitement had been built up." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1929 novel by Vicki Baum, "Grand Hotel" features music by Robert 
Wright, lyrics by George Forrest and book by Luther Davis, the same 
Tony-winning creative team who brought us "Kismet." Their very different 
earlier version, called "At the Grand," starring Paul Muni, played the Los 
Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1958, but did not go on to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Hotel" has a completely new look and sound. Richards read the script and 
heard several songs from the show last December, and when Tune got involved a 
month later, "that was the clincher. I said, 'I loved the material but it 
depended on the director -- it had to be done in a contemporary way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Producer Circle put up $300,000 in seed money, financed a workshop at the 
Diplomat Hotel last April, and given Tune's enthusiasm, started shopping the 
show to theater owners. Richards says they got $1 million from the Jujamcyn 
theater chain, owners of the Martin Beck Theatre, where the show opens Nov. 12, 
and further commitments from other producers totaling $4,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Richards still doesn't know how he put the financing together so fast, 
especially since everybody was trying to raise money from the same people. 
"It's the same group of crazies that really love the theater -- maybe 40, maybe 
more," says Richards, a former singer and casting director. "You have to be 
very brave to do it. I make movies and have never lost a nickel. I've lost 
money in the theater, but I keep doing it because of the live energy." 
</P>
<P>
Richards and his wife, Mary Lea Johnson, have already produced or co-produced 
16 other Broadway shows, including Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Crimes 
of the Heart" and Tony-winner "La Cage aux Folles." Many of their shows have 
been directed by Harold Prince, including such hits as "Sweeney Todd" and "On 
the Twentieth Century" and such financial failures as "Grind" and "Rosa." 
</P>
<P>
Richards clearly enjoys working with directors like Prince and Tune, but says 
at one point that "the business side stinks. . . . At one time, every show was 
seen. Now the superhit makes money and a hit breaks even and the rest go down 
the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Hope is running high on "Grand Hotel." Paramount Pictures came in as a producer 
during the Boston run and Richards says the film company has a first refusal on 
any future film. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 "Grand Hotel," which finished its pre-Broadway run last night in 
Boston, shares just one song with the 1958 production. This time out, Liliane 
Montevecchi plays the Greta Garbo role from the Oscar-winning 1932 film, and 
the cast also includes Karen Akers, Timothy Jerome and Jane Krakowski. 
</P>
<P>
But there's still work to do. The Boston Globe's reviewer, Kevin Kelly, called 
the show a "sophisticated entertainment with real potential," qualifying his 
review with the remark the show needed work before going to Broadway. Tune and 
company are indeed "working like crazy," Richards said a few days later by 
phone from Boston. "It's been getting better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 "Grand Hotel" opens at the Martin Beck Theatre, 302 W. 45th St. on Nov. 12. 
Previews begin Oct. 17. Tickets are $45, $50 and $55 Monday through Saturday 
evenings and Saturday matinee. Wednesday matinee tickets are $37.50, $42.50 and 
$47.50. 
</P>
<P>
Three Old Friends Decide to Put on a Show: 'City of Angels' 
</P>
<P>
Nick Vanoff is a stage and television producer. He is also a patient man. For 
years, he talked with Cy Coleman and Larry Gelbart about one day working 
together on a show. He'd known composer Coleman for 35 years and playwright 
Gelbart nearly as long. 
</P>
<P>
When Coleman and Gelbart finally finished their new musical comedy thriller 
"City of Angels," says Vanoff, "they sent me the book, and I liked it. They 
came over to my house (in Los Angeles) and played (the music) for me and my 
wife. We both loved what we heard, and I then naively went about doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Vanoff then called Roger Berlind, whose latest musical was "Jerome Robbins' 
Broadway," and asked him to get involved. Sitting with Vanoff at a restaurant 
near the show's rehearsal hall, Berlind nods in agreement: "I read the book, 
heard the score and had the same exact reaction." 
</P>
<P>
It was a go. 
</P>
<P>
With a cost of $4.2 million, the show has a list of producers that also 
includes both Jujamcyn Theaters, owner of the 1,250-seat Virginia Theatre where 
the show opens Dec. 7, and the Shubert Organization, which Vanoff says is "very 
high on the property." Also part of the producing team is Suntory 
International, a Japanese firm that co-produced "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
The show's unusual staging features an amalgam of film and stage techniques. As 
Vanoff and Coleman explain it, "City of Angels" is set in the late '40s and 
portrays a novelist's trials and tribulations writing a screenplay based on his 
detective novel. "One set is the movie he sees in his head as he writes it," 
says Vanoff. "Those scenes are in black and white. The action, which is real 
life, takes place in color, as life is."

Gelbart, whose play "Mastergate" opens on Broadway this month, earlier wrote "A 
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "Sly Fox." Tony winner 
Coleman wrote the scores for such shows as "Sweet Charity" and "On the 
Twentieth Century." Lyrics are by newcomer David Zippel. Director Michael 
Blakemore directed "Noises Off," among other shows. 
</P>
<P>
"City of Angels" opens directly on Broadway. "We feel the book is in very good 
shape and we like what we have," says Emmy-winning TV producer Vanoff, who also 
produced Jackie Mason's smash hit, "The World According to Me!" "Usually, 
you're out of town seeing the book, and we think the book is strong enough. It 
is a fairly complicated show to do scenically. So instead of going out of town, 
we added extended rehearsals and previews." 
</P>
<P>
Listen to composer Coleman, interviewed later that day after an audition for 
his next musical, a show based on the life of Will Rogers. "We're doing 
something that's not only a musical, but flashy, new and I hope very welcome on 
the Broadway scene," says Coleman of "City of Angels." "It's one of the first 
book musicals to come along in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "City of Angels" opens at the Virginia Theatre, 245 W. 52nd St., on Dec. 7. 
Previews begin Nov. 14. Ticket prices are $40, $45 and $50 Tuesday through 
Saturday evenings and weekend matinees. Wednesday matinee tickets are $35, $40 
and $45.

Off-Broadway Hit Revival Moves to Not-for-Profit Broadway House 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway season's first hit musical is being produced at Circle in the 
Square Theatre, one of Broadway's two not-for-profit houses. 
</P>
<P>
The show is a revival of the Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical, "Sweeney 
Todd." Director Susan H. Schulman's chamber version of "Sweeney," which packed 
the tiny York Theatre off-off-Broadway, was picked up by Circle. The audience 
size jumped from 99 to 600 but critics have generally agreed the show didn't 
suffer with expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The productions at both the York and Circle are scaled down considerably from 
the 1979 Tony-winning version at the 1,900-seat Gershwin (then called the Uris) 
Theatre. These simpler productions also take a different perspective on 
"Sweeney Todd's" dark tale of a vengeance-seeking barber whose murder victims 
are the key ingredient in his downstairs neighbor's best-selling meat pies. 
</P>
<P>
The original production, directed by Harold Prince, had a massive steel set 
that used pieces hauled in from a closed New England foundry and created the 
dark mood of workers crushed by the Industrial Revolution. The show centered 
less on Len Cariou's "demon barber of Fleet Street" than on Angela Lansbury's 
pie maker. 
</P>
<P>
In Schulman's vision, the story is more the personal tragedy of a man who 
avenges the loss of his wife and child and less the impact of the Industrial 
age. Beth Fowler's pie-maker is softer, more sympathetic, and so is Bob 
Gunton's Sweeney Todd. "The focus is Sweeney," says Circle in the Square's 
producing director Paul Libin, "where it should be. A little part of you is 
cheering for Sweeney." 
</P>
<P>
While many regional theaters around the country have regularly featured 
crowd-pleasing musicals, Libin says this is just Circle's third musical since 
1972. "We've always wanted to do musicals," says Libin, "but one of the reasons 
we haven't is that musicals are expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Circle's costs run higher than other not-for-profit theaters, says Libin, 
because of its Broadway environment, yet its costs are still considerably below 
its larger Broadway neighbors. "Sweeney Todd" is running under $600,000 to 
produce at Circle, says Libin. But if the show moved to a commercial Broadway 
house, he says "you couldn't do it for less than $5 million." (It cost $1.2 
million in 1979.) 
</P>
<P>
While Circle in the Square has 12,000 subscribers, they are apparently a pretty 
patient group of people. Ever since George C. Scott suggested in 1982 that they 
simply extend his popular run in Noel Coward's "Present Laughter" rather than 
move the show to a bigger house, Circle has run shows at this theater without 
fixed closing dates. (They also present shows at Circle Downtown and 
occasionally elsewhere.) Tina Howe's play, "Coastal Disturbances," played there 
just under a year, Libin says. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have to close down successes and keep failures running," says 
Libin. "Our subscribers commit to three plays, and history has proven that 
subscribers are happy to wait with their and our success. I pray they'll feel 
the same way about 'Sweeney Todd.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweeney Todd" is playing at Circle in the Square Theatre, 235 W. 50th. 
Tickets for Friday and Saturday evening performances are $40. Other evening 
performances and weekend matinees are $37.50.

VYING FOR THE WORLD'S TOP CONDUCTING POST; 
</P>
<P>
MEMBERS OF BERLIN PHILHARMONIC BEGIN VOTING TODAY TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR TO THE 
LATE HERBERT VON KARAJAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sometime today, the 120 members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will 
gather in their meeting room in the Philharmonie, Berlin's largest concert 
hall, to begin the final selection of a replacement for music director Herbert 
von Karajan, who resigned his lifetime position in April, three months before 
his death at the age of 81. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation on who will be chosen by the Berlin's colleagues, as they refer to 
one another, has been intense. Last spring, the musicians were besieged after a 
rumor spread that they were meeting to select Karajan's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an army of TV people, cameras, lights," said Fergus McWilliam, a 
Canadian who is one of the orchestra's horn players. "You couldn't even get 
through them and the more you'd protest, the more they'd disbelieve you." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, meanwhile, have offered lists of possible candidates. Lorin Maazel 
was described as a leading candidate by the New York Times. A Wall Street 
Journal article said Maazel "heads the short list, which also includes Bernard 
Haitink and Riccardo Muti." 
</P>
<P>
All of which has not been lost on the musicians, an organized and powerful 
group. "One local paper wrote a cogent article that the orchestra shouldn't 
feel pressure from the international press," McWilliam said. "We're used to 
pressure and being in the limelight and have a pretty good success rate at 
keeping our traps shut." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the speculation, it is the musicians who will select the Berlin 
Philharmonic's next music director, which many -- certainly the Berliners -- 
see as the world's top conducting job. The Berlin Cultural Senate has a 
theoretical veto, but there is small chance that it might object to the 
orchestra's selection. 
</P>
<P>
Although having orchestra members choose their conductor is unheard of in the 
United States, it has a long German tradition. In America, a music director is 
usually chosen by a search committee, which consists of the orchestra's 
management, several board members and perhaps a musician selected as the 
orchestra's representative. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Maazel would not have been chosen as music director of the Cleveland 
Orchestra in 1971 had it been up to the musicians, who awarded him only two 
votes in an informal poll In contrast, most German orchestras have the right to 
select not only the music director, but the other musicians as well. 
</P>
<P>
The colleagues form two orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which 
receives a $10-million annual subsidy from the Berlin Cultural Senate and plays 
110 concerts in Berlin, and the Berlin Philharmonic, which plays tours, makes 
recordings and broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition is the central concern. In fact, the players call the Berlin 
Philharmonic Orchestra a living tradition, with only Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm 
Furtwangler and Karajan as its music directors in this century. Musicians speak 
proudly of playing in the Berlin style, not only of sound, but of tempo and 
expression. Most conductors -- although not all -- would rather work with the 
orchestra than face a battle they will probably lose over trying to make 
radical changes in the Berlin style. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very set in our ways," said Robert Platt, a trumpet player who is one of 
two Americans in the orchestra. "Our repertoire is repeated over and over. So 
when a conductor comes in, we know the piece and are set in our ways. There's 
not too much he can change." 
</P>
<P>
Selecting a conductor -- although certainly among their most important acts -- 
is not the only choice that the colleagues make. The entire orchestra is 
required to attend the auditions of prospective members, who perform in full 
view of the orchestra, unlike their U.S. counterparts, who usually play their 
audition behind a screen. 
</P>
<P>
After a probationary period that may last up to two years, the orchestra votes 
on whether to accept the musician -- for life. While colleagues may 
theoretically be fired, it is more likely that they will be moved to a less 
demanding post. 
</P>
<P>
"Life with the orchestra doesn't get dull," said Stefan Jezierski, an American 
in the orchestra's horn section. "It's one urgent meeting after another, like 
trying to put 120 individualists together and having them form an orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the orchestra's authority grants certain provisions. Karajan had the 
right to veto the selection of a player he deemed unsuitable and the colleagues 
have the same right, which they exercised in the widely publicized case of 
clarinetist Sabine Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
Karajan wanted to accept Meyer, and several players, though acknowledging her 
technical ability, said the orchestra rejected her because her tone did not fit 
with the Berlin sound, not because she was a woman, despite news accounts to 
the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has three women players and in fact, McWilliam said, at the time 
of the Meyer incident the orchestra had already accepted its first female 
colleague, Madeleine Carruzzo, a violinist who joined several years before. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the result was a bitter, divisive conflict which, along with a 
dispute between Karajan and the orchestra's management, finally resulted in the 
ailing conductor's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake about it, this is a powerful orchestra. When a performance of 
Mahler's Ninth Symphony with Claudio Abbado was scheduled in London this summer 
a few days before the beginning of the orchestra's traditional vacation, the 
colleagues refused, saying: "This is ridiculous," Jezierski said. 
</P>
<P>
The selection process also reflects the musicians' viewpoint: In June, they 
were told to compile a "wish list," in which every player submitted the names 
of three prospective candidates -- any three candidates. For example, just 
because Muti has signed a lifetime contract with the Philadelphia Orchestra and 
told a press conference in May that he didn't want the Berlin job doesn't mean 
he isn't in the running. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no constraints -- anyone," Jezierski said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the colleagues have made their choice, they plan to simply ask him if he 
wants to be their conductor, secure in the knowledge that they will be nearly 
impossible to turn down. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all of this, one shouldn't imagine that the process is ticking away 
with well-oiled efficiency. For if the musicians have the right to select a 
conductor, it's something they haven't done often. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really doing it for the first time," said McWilliam, who began playing 
full time with the orchestra in 1985. "The 1955 election was pretty black and 
white. The orchestra's choice was a confirmation, asking all those who were 
against Karajan, who was the obvious candidate." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the "wish list" included some candidates who had only a 
theoretical presence. Conductors at this level have long careers and often make 
guest appearances; all of the candidates are well known to the orchestra. As 
McWilliam said, the colleagues might not wish to offend someone they will have 
to work with by excluding him even though they feel he would not be 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the arguments by those who wanted an early decision was that we know 
them all," McWilliam said. "But others are more inclined to say, like climbing 
a mountain, that you reach a resting spot before you begin the next leg of the 
journey." 
</P>
<P>
In general terms, the list was to be narrowed to eight "favorites" and 
ultimately to two or three candidates from which the final selection would be 
made. But this is not necessarily being done, depending on the source. 
</P>
<P>
"How it is going to work is very hard to say," said Platt. "The plan has 
already changed two or three times." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is an emphasis on keeping the orchestra mostly German as far as 
players' nationalities are concerned, the conductor's nationality is not so 
important. Karajan was Austrian and only one possible candidate, Carlos 
Kleiber, is German. At least one candidate, Muti, does not speak German, but 
although this poses some difficulties, it is manageable. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't really matter what they're saying if the message is clear," 
McWilliam said. "Some work in Italian, some in French; it can be a mishmash of 
four languages in one sentence. It's not a big issue." 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly no unanimity as to the first choice among the players. 
Although no one was willing to name the eight favorites directly, Jezierski, 
saying "Anything is really guessing," listed the those who might have received 
the most votes -- in no special order -- as Kleiber, James Levine, Muti, 
Haitink, Zubin Mehta, Maazel, Abbado, Leonard Bernstein and Daniel Barenboim. 
"It could be any combination of those," he said, "Maybe Seiji Ozawa." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the Berlin philosophy, Jezierski offered insights on some of 
the candidates, but in positive terms: 
</P>
<P>
* "Maazel has a lot of support. He's a genius, but I don't know if he's willing 
to make the commitment. It would be hard to find someone better. But he doesn't 
have the position at this time." 
</P>
<P>
* "Muti and Levine have done some good concerts. Muti might prefer to be king 
in Philadelphia because the music director in the United States calls the 
shots. But no one knows if he wants to come to Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
* "Bernstein hasn't expressed an interest, but if he'd want to make a 
commitment it would be very interesting. A lot of people in the orchestra would 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
* "Mehta is also a possibility. He might get some votes." 
</P>
<P>
* "Ozawa will probably also get some votes. Everyone respects him a lot, but 
it's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
The musicians are expecting another media onslaught once the choice has been 
made. "All the details will be under strict secrecy," McWilliam said. "There's 
an image of being in a locked room with no phones, unable to talk to our wives. 
We'll probably face that army of TV people again." 
</P>
<P>
And whomever the colleagues choose, it will be someone who wants to work with 
the orchestra as it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Tradition is vital to the orchestra's identity, to it's self-image," McWilliam 
said. "It's a responsibility handed down to us, a heritage we must preserve. We 
must find an appropriate guardian for tradition and also someone who can chart 
new paths, take the orchestra into the next century without a terrible break 
with the past." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It's a breathtaking opportunity to be there when the choice is 
made."

<P>
Esther Edwards remembers the old days when the Temptations used to work out 
their dance steps on the front porch of an aging two-story stucco house in 
inner-city Detroit. She says she can still see the Supremes sitting outside on 
the grass, playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
"You never realize you're making history at the moment you're making it," 
Edwards says, standing inside that same old house on West Grand Boulevard -- 
the building where Berry Gordy launched Motown Records in 1959. "In the old 
days, I don't think anyone in the company ever considered the extent of what 
Motown's music might mean around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a yellow blouse, white heels and a matching green linen skirt and 
jacket, Edwards was parceling out nostalgic tidbits to a group of tourists -- 
part of about 16,000 fans a year who pay $3 each to see the place where Stevie 
Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye and little Michael Jackson all got their 
start. Once a vice president of Motown, she now volunteers her days as an 
administrator at the Motown Museum. 
</P>
<P>
For many Motown fans around the world, the small house -- boldly declared 
"Hitsville USA" by the young Gordy -- stands today as a musical shrine. It not 
only houses Gordy's old office, but the original Motown recording studio. The 
landmark currently serves as the headquarters for the Motown Museum Historical 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization created by Gordy's sister, Esther Edwards. 
Because of her efforts, Hitsville USA was designated an official State of 
Michigan Historical site in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During her tours, Edwards tells visitors not just the musical history of the 
old Motown days but the social history as well. "Few forces have cut across 
ethnic lines like Motown did. What happened in this building is truly an 
American phenomenon," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards stands beneath a poster of the Supremes and brandishes a stack of guest 
books filled with thousands of signatures from travelers from countries as far 
away as Kenya, Norway, France, Japan and Brazil. Among the Americans who have 
paid visits: Jesse Jackson, Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis Jr. and Motown 
discoveries Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we owed it to the fans," Edwards says. "If the music of Motown means so 
much to people that they are willing to hop on a plane and cross the ocean just 
to get a glimpse of the grounds, then we ought to have something here for them 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
Until 1967, when Motown moved its business headquarters to a high-rise on 
Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit, Gordy's house served as the company's sole 
recording studio and office. After Motown abandoned Detroit for Los Angeles in 
1972, Gordy pulled the plug on the West Grand Boulevard recording studio and 
turned the building into a Midwest public relations and promotions office. 
</P>
<P>
Still, for 13 years the old house continued to attract a steady stream of 
visitors from around the world. Indeed, so many fans showed up unannounced at 
Hitsville USA's door that in 1985 Edwards decided to convert the defunct 
Detroit headquarters into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Detroiters realize that the company moved to Los Angeles in 1972," 
Edwards says. "But everyone else in the world thinks Motown is still in 
Detroit." At the request of his sister, Berry Gordy donated the house and all 
the 1960s memorabilia he owned. With the help of volunteers and a $125,000 
contribution from ex-Motowner Michael Jackson in 1988, Edwards has initiated 
cosmetic improvements and upgraded the museum's air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, in the beginning, I never thought it was all that important," Gordy 
says, speaking by phone from his Hollywood office. "Esther's the pack rat of 
the family, the one who keeps everything. I suppose I was too busy moving 
forward with commercial thoughts and creativity and new ideas and all. I 
thought all the stuff from the old days there was junk. 
</P>
<P>
"But, you know, whenever artists like Smokey (Robinson) or Michael (Jackson) 
would stop by the museum, they would just call me up in tears, saying, 'Oh, I'm 
here and I feel this and I feel that.' And it moved me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Gordy decided to go back and see what his sister had created. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how sometimes you have these deja vu feelings?" he says, his voice 
softening. "Well, that's how it was the first time I visited the museum. 
Looking at the walls, at the sheet music, at the linoleum in the control booth, 
all worn out where we used to sit and pat our feet during recordings. Because, 
even as everything else has moved and grown, Hitsville has always remained a 
constant -- the spiritual grounds for the entire Motown thing." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Hitsville USA is a bare-bones operation -- a simple museum in 
which Edwards has transformed her brother's former living quarters into a 
gallery of memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Hallways are covered with silk-screened concert posters and cardboard cut-outs 
of Motown acts. The walls are lined with rare press releases, gold records and 
sheet music. Motown artifacts like Michael Jackson's glove, Diana Ross' old 
bank receipts (with a $2 balance in her bank account), and a bounced check from 
Smokey Robinson's lean years are displayed in glass cases. Out-of-print 
Langston Hughes and Stokely Carmichael album covers compete with European 
road-show broadsides for wall space. 
</P>
<P>
Golden oldies by the Miracles, the Temptations and the Four Tops provide an 
uninterrupted sound track for visitors as they peruse cabinets of 8x10 
glossies, newspaper clippings and historic documents. Gordy's kitchen functions 
as a souvenir shop. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the historic exhibits in the West Grand Boulevard house, Studio A is 
certainly the most significant. It has been said that the sound produced by 
this room was valued so highly by Motown that executives considered dismantling 
the entire studio and reassembling it in Los Angeles when the company moved in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
With its hardwood floors and acoustically tiled walls and ceilings, the entire 
room is not much bigger than a tiny Midwestern basement. "The unit we recorded 
on back then was certainly a lot different than the ones people record on now," 
Gordy explains. "But it was fun because it was all so pure and honest. Artists 
had to be able to sing and perform to make it in those days. All of us had a 
lot of fun together making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Because that's what really happened there -- Hitsville was a beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, Gordy -- who had co-written hits for Jackie Wilson ("Lonely 
Teardrops," "Reet Petite") -- decided to create his own label. Just 29, he 
borrowed $800 from a family trust, bought a used two-track tape recorder from a 
local deejay and purchased the house on West Grand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, Gordy's company was pumping out pop hits like a Ford assembly 
line. Outside of the Beatles, few hit-makers could match the consecutive 
chart-topping strength of the Motown sound. In the decade between the Miracles' 
1961 "Shop Around" and the Temptations' 1971 "Just My Imagination," Hitsville 
USA produced more than 100 Top 10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Motown's company motto, "The Sound of Young America," was no mere public 
relations ploy. At its peak, Gordy's payroll on West Grand Boulevard supported 
450 non-artist staff members, with an average age of 23. For many Detroit 
teen-agers, Hitsville USA came to symbolize their ticket out of the ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor kids from broken homes would rush here after school and hang out all 
night. Between 1959 and 1972, this little house was like home for a lot of 
kids," Edwards says. "Without Motown, most of the talent discovered in this 
building would have been overlooked by society." 
</P>
<P>
Another one of Motown's major accomplishments was its ability to consistently 
sell black music to mainstream audiences. "Race was never an issue with us, 
because we were always thinking about creativity, about trying to create great 
commercial music," Gordy says. "In terms of opposing the business 
Establishment, I did take a stand as far as an independent company versus the 
major record companies. It just so happened that all the majors were white and 
we were black. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, the only thing we were really concerned about was the honesty 
of the music. We never thought about black or white or anything," Gordy says. 
"We had no idea that Motown would go as far and as wide as it did, that people 
from all over the world would end up having such an intimate relationship with 
the house and the music that came from there."

CANSECO'S HOT LINE IS ANYTHING BUT

When you're on the road and you're lonely, you call a friend, right? But what 
if you get bored talking to your friend, because he's not rich and famous and a 
big baseball star with a lot of neat sports cars you might someday get to ride 
in? 
</P>
<P>
Easy. You call Jose Canseco. He's got his own phone line that dispenses 
recorded information about the superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the jet lag or the three-hour time change, but for some reason, I 
woke up Tuesday morning before Game 1 of the American League playoffs with an 
overwhelming desire to talk to Jose. Probably because we have so much in 
common. Brown hair. Brown eyes. Speak a little Spanish. Have played baseball. 
Get our picture in the paper. Plus hundreds of other intimate details there 
isn't room to go into here. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Jose, I've never been arrested, but hey, if the cops clamored for my 
autograph like they do his, I might get arrested on purpose, just to make their 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Wanna make Jose's? Give him a call. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, I'm Jose Canseco and thank you for calling my hotline." 
</P>
<P>
Voice: "Press 1 on your touch-tone phone to hear Jose talk about yesterday's 
game, and about his personal life. To hear Jose discuss the topics of steroids, 
his ownership of guns or about speeding, press 2. If you'd like to leave a 
message or a question for Jose Canseco, which may be answered right here on the 
hotline at a later date, press 7. If you don't have a touch-tone phone, stay on 
the line and you will hear a specially prepared program, just for you. Make 
your selection now." 
</P>
<P>
I pressed 1. For seven minutes, Jose talked about what his Monday had been 
like. It made me feel better about mine. 
</P>
<P>
Jose said there had been no game. He said the A's were getting ready to play 
the uh, (long pause) Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Jose said that the A's had had a 3 o'clock or 3:30 p.m. workout. He said that 
he got there at 2:30 or 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Just hanging around the ballpark, talked to the guys. We decided how we were 
going to divide the shares (postseason money). We had to get that out of the 
way. Everyone made out pretty good. Everything (at practice) was normal, except 
there were 60 or 70 people from the media. It was like a circus attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Jose said he went out to shag fly balls. When he loosened up, his legs didn't 
feel as sore as usual. 
</P>
<P>
At batting practice, Jose said, he hit in the last group, with Dave Parker, and 
organized a home-run hitting contest. Jose hit first, but he hit only two of 10 
pitches out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to use some psychology (on Parker), always telling him, 'Oh, you 
couldn't hit two out.' Try to make him nervous. And I won the contest, because 
he hit only one home run. Between pitches, as the ball was in flight, I'd 
scream at him, try to throw his concentration off." 
</P>
<P>
Jose said that the A's met to discuss Dave Stieb, the Blue Jays' Game 1 
starting pitcher, then met the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them will ask some strange questions. Some will ask interesting 
questions. These are things you have to go through. In a ballplayer's life, you 
have to give the media the time." 
</P>
<P>
Jose's hotline is Canseco's attempt to get equal time. Canseco says he and his 
agents -- he has four -- came up with the hotline idea to balance what they 
feel is negative reporting about the 25-year-old superstar, who has been pulled 
over by police seven times in the last 15 months and was arrested last year for 
carrying an unregistered handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Hot, Jose's hotline isn't. Canseco records a new message every night, but the 
messages are rambling, amateurish and, to tell the truth, boring. If your other 
friends sounded this interesting on the phone, you'd get it disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't game time yet and I wanted to hear what else Jose had to say. Knowing 
I could put the charges on my expense account, I called Jose back and pressed 2 
to hear him discuss steroids, speeding and handguns. 
</P>
<P>
For six minutes, he rambled. His stories weren't nearly as spicy as stories 
involving steroids, speeding and handguns should be. 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe it? Reach out and touch someone. Call Jose. 
</P>
<P>
But don't call collect.

FRED MERKLE'S BONEHEAD PLAY FORCED GIANT-CUB PLAYOFF IN 1908 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cubs and Giants in the playoffs. It's happened before. In New York, 1908, a 
time when the motto was "it's great to be young and a Giant." Fred Merkle was 
both. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen years old, he was only a minor player on a team led by Manager John 
McGraw and pitcher Christy Mathewson, a backup first baseman who batted just 41 
times that season. 
</P>
<P>
But a lack of concentration, a failure to touch base, so to speak, ensured that 
this lifetime .273 hitter would be remembered as long as any future Hall of 
Famer of that time. 
</P>
<P>
"Merkle's Boner" it's called, a mindless blunder that ended 1 hour and 30 
minutes of timeless baseball. A baserunning mistake which cost the Giants a 
pennant and set off a chain of events that reduce modern-day incidents like 
George Brett's pinetar bat and Jay Howell's scuffed baseballs to playground 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs and Giants. The most powerful teams of the 1900s. Mathewson. McGraw. 
Three Finger Brown. Tinker to Evers to Chance. Stars of the deadball era's 
greatest rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"Friendly competition" would have been unimaginable. No diplomacy was necessary 
then; those teams hated each other, cursing and fighting right on the field. 
Mathewson, a Bucknell graduate and accomplished chess player, was the 
exception. McGraw and the Cubs' Johnny Evers were more like it: fierce, dirty 
competitors who ruthlessly seized on any opportunity for victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs, defending World Champions and winners of 223 games over the two 
previous seasons, were heavily favored to repeat in 1908. Pittsburgh, led by 
the great Honus Wagner at short, player-manager Fred Clarke and a deep pitching 
staff, seemed a good bet for second. 
</P>
<P>
But the Giants had McGraw, widely acknowledged as the shrewdest manager of his 
time, and Mathewson, the graceful artist of the "fadeaway," an early version of 
the screwball that made him a perennial 30-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
Helped along by hard-hitting outfielder "Turkey" Mike Donlin, slick shortstop 
Al Bridwell and first baseman Larry Doyle, the Giants overcame numerous 
injuries, moving into first Aug. 24 by sweeping a doubleheader from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
In late September, with the Cubs coming to town, the Giants led Chicago by 
three and 16 of their remaining 19 games were scheduled for the Polo Grounds, 
which now had about 6,000 additional seats to accomodate New York's devoted 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
But a doubleheader sweep by Chicago on Sept. 22 reduced the lead to one and set 
the stage for the most astonishing tie in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
The pitchers were Mathewson and Jack Pfiester, whose efficiency in beating New 
York gave him the nickname, "Jack the Giant Killer." With first baseman Fred 
Tenney bothered by sore legs, Merkle filled in. 
</P>
<P>
The first eight innings were like hundreds of other deadball games, a 1-1 
deadlock with Mathewson tagged for an inside-the-park homer by nemesis Joe 
Tinker in the fifth and Donlin singling home a run the following inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mathewson, winner of 37 games that year, settled down after Tinker's hit and 
breezed past the Cubs in the ninth, even fanning the hated Evers. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom half of the inning, after Pfiester retired Cy Seymour on a 
grounder to Evers, Art Devlin lined a single to center. Moose McCormick forced 
Devlin with another grounder to second, but Merkle singled to right and the 
Giants had runners on first and third with two out. 
</P>
<P>
The next batter, Bridwell, later described what followed: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the first pitch came in to me -- a fastball, waist high, right over the 
center of the plate -- and I promptly drilled a line drive past Johnny Evers 
and out into right center field. Bob Emslie was the umpire that day and he fell 
on his can to avoid being hit by the ball . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I ran to first base and McCormick raced home . . . But Merkle 
didn't go all the way to second base. Instead, he went halfway down and then 
cut off and started running for the clubhouse, which was out in right center . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
Just imagine seeing this on national television: Thousand of delirious fans 
have poured onto the field; Evers is screaming for center fielder Solly Hofman 
to give him the ball so he can tag second for the force; Joe McGinnity, once a 
30-game winner, but now a coach for the Giants, grabs the ball and throws it 
into the left-field bleachers amidst thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Evers retrieves the ball, perhaps not THE ball, yet still, a 
regulation, major league baseball. He pushes through the crowd, steps on second 
and awaits the call. But from whom? The umpires, Emslie and Hank O'Day, hadn't 
seen the play. 
</P>
<P>
It should have ended then. Evers had actually tried the same manuever 19 days 
earlier against Pittsburgh, and the same umpire, O'Day, ruled against him. But 
with the Cubs demanding action, O'Day, from his hotel room, decided that since 
Merkle had not touched the base and McGinnity had interfered, the run was 
nullified and the game would be recorded a 1-1 tie due to darkness. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't good enough for the Cubs, however. The way Chicago president 
Charles Murphy saw it, since the Giants failed to clear the fans off the field, 
his team should be awarded the game by forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
Player-manager Frank Chance had his own ideas. The following afternoon he had 
the Cubs on the field at 1:30, 2 1/2 hours before gametime, and said that 
because the Giants failed to show up for the completion of yesterday's contest, 
Chicago should be awarded the victory. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work, of course, neither did McGraw's appeals to the National League 
president and the National Commission for an overruling. When the Giants beat 
Chicago 5-4 in the series' finale, with an exhausted Mathewson coming on in the 
seventh to preserve the win, they led by two with little over a week remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Merkle would enjoy a fine career, even starring for the pennant-winning Cubs 10 
years later, but this almost finished him. Denounced by The New York Times for 
"censurable stupidity" and The Sporting News for "thorough ignorance," Merkle 
was miserable, unable to eat or sleep, wishing "that a large, roomy and 
comfortable hole would open up and swallow me" 
</P>
<P>
His teammates could have bailed him out by holding onto to the lead, but Harry 
Coveleski, a 22-year-old left-hander for Philadelphia, became the second 
pitcher to earn the nickname "Giant Killer" by beating New York three times in 
the next five days. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and Cubs finished the season with identical 98-55 records and the 
National League board of directors scheduled a one-game playoff for Oct. 8 at 
the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
It almost never came off. A furious McGraw, still insisting New York had 
already won, told his players they didn't even have to show up and left it to a 
vote. With several Giants favoring a boycott, Mathewson and four others met 
with team president John T. Brush, who assured the players that a $10,000 bonus 
would be distributed whether they won or lost. 
</P>
<P>
When the Cubs arrived at the ballpark for the deciding game, they were met, to 
their horror, by thousands of fans and had to be escorted by police to get 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard anybody or any set of men called as many foul names as the 
Giants fans called us that day from the time we showed up till it was over," 
Brown remembered. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants tried everything. McGinnity, hoping to pick a fight with Chance and 
get him ejected, interrupted the Cubs' fielding practice after 15 minutes by 
ringing a bell from the bench and ordering them to get off. 
</P>
<P>
Chance didn't throw any punches, but faced off with the coach at home plate 
while Evers and McGraw swore at each other from a distance. Then, Dr. Joseph M. 
Creamer, McGraw's handpicked team physician, approached the umpires, showed 
them an envelope containing $5,000, and said, according to crew chief Bill 
Klem, "You know who is behind me and you needn't add anything." (Creamer was 
banned from major league parks the following year). 
</P>
<P>
But McGraw was out of luck and Mathewson out of steam. With New York leading 
1-0 and Tinker leading off the third, the pitcher motioned his outfielders to 
move back. Donlin in right obeyed, so did left fielder McCormick, but Seymour 
stayed where he was and Tinker tripled over the center fielder's head. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Johnny Kling followed with an RBI single, Evers walked two outs later 
and doubles by Frank "Wildfire" Schulte and Chance made it 4-1. Winning, a 4-2 
final, was the easy part. Getting off the field was harder. In fact, it was 
downright dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"A lunatic asylum" was Brown's memory. Outraged fans assaulted the Cubs, one 
breaking a cartilage in Chance's neck, another pulling a knife on Pfiester. 
When Brown approached the walkway to catch the "L" train at 155th street, he 
told the police to get away because they might attract attention, and strolled 
untouched onto the subway car. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw never forgave the league officials for taking away a pennant, but 
fiercely defended Merkle, taunted for years with shouts of "bonehead," and even 
gave the first baseman a $300 raise for his 1909 contract. 
</P>
<P>
And was Merkle the only "bonehead" on the 1908 Giants? In the first inning of 
the playoff game, Tenney was hit by Pfiester and Buck Herzog walked. 
</P>
<P>
When Roger Breshnahan struck out, the ball fell out of Kling's glove and landed 
right by the catcher's feet. Responding to shouts of "Go on!" "Go on!", Herzog 
broke for second, realized his mistake and was easily thrown out to kill the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
The runner should have listened more carefully, he would have recognized the 
voice of Evers urging him to advance.

CUBS' GRACE AND GIANTS' WILLIAMS SHOWING TALENT IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are young, wonderfully talented players other than Will Clark in the 
National League Championship Series. What's there not to like about San 
Francisco Giants third baseman Matt Williams, who has a home run, double and 
four RBI in the first two games? Or the Cubs' Mark Grace, who is 6-for-8 with 
six RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Let's start with Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to hit as many home runs as Kevin did this season. He almost did 
this year," Giants Manager Roger Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison, of course, was with Kevin Mitchell, who hit 47. Williams, 
splitting his time between the Giants and Phoenix of the Pacific Coast League, 
wound up with 44, 18 of them in 292 big-league at-bats. He added another 
Thursday night, with a runner on in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has two problems: He hit .202 for the Giants in '89, and he's a 
23-year-old who, unless you get up close, looks 38. 
</P>
<P>
The batting average figures to get better. Evidence of that was his .320 
average with Phoenix. He is 3-for-8 in this series, and impressed teammate 
Brett Butler in Game 1 when he went with a breaking ball to right field for a 
two-run double. "He has struggled with that this year," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
As for appearing far older than he is, that situation isn't likely to improve. 
Blocky despite standing 6-2, he hardly presents the streamlined look of youth. 
Then there's his hair, or what's left of it. 
</P>
<P>
"College did it to me," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
He did more than worry, though, at UNLV. He developed a pair of hands that 
bring to mind Brooks Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"My coaches helped me there," Williams said. "They had this drill where you 
would take a Ping-Pong paddle and cut off the handle. You put five strands of 
plastic on one side, insert your fingers and go play defense. It's real tough 
to catch the ball with that as your glove. It makes you try to be fluid with 
both hands because the paddle alone isn't going to glove the ball. You create 
soft hands." 
</P>
<P>
Hands that envelop and absorb. Williams displayed them marvelously in Game 1, 
along with quick reactions. Those of us who haven't seen much of the Giants may 
have been surprised. Cubs manager and former Giants coach Don Zimmer wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, that he can play it is no revelation to me," Zimmer said. "I coached 
there in '87. We used him about 80 games at shortstop even though he wasn't 
ready to hit in the big leagues. That's how good he can pick it." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Grace. Have you seen any better at-bat than his 12-pitch encounter 
against Scott Garrelts in the first inning of Game 1? Grace fouled off eight 
pitches before going the other way on a full-count fastball and hitting a 
two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
As with Williams, Zimmer isn't surprised when Grace comes through. "He has the 
same intensity Will Clark has," Zimmer said. "Look in their eyes. Those are 
eyes that concentrate, hitters' eyes."

PLAYOFF PRESSURE -- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sleepless nights. A pounding in the pit of the stomach. Pressure that builds 
until it grabs hold of a team and shakes it to the core. This is what it's like 
to play in baseball's League Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
The playoffs are almost a cruel practical joke engineered for prime-time 
entertainment. Only baseball plays a marathon, 162-game season, and then 
determines its champion with a sprint -- a best-of-seven playoff leading to the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to prepare for fall baseball," said Davey Lopes, who made five 
playoff appearances with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs. "You're so 
focused on the games. You have tunnel vision. You don't sleep. Everything is 
magnified. So many people are watching for one little mistake. You're under a 
microscope, and the whole world is focused on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
The players and managers will tell you the World Series is easy, but the 
playoffs are frightening. They can bring a glorious season to a bitter end. 
That's why divisional titles are just one stop for this year's survivors -- the 
Toronto Blue Jays, Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. 
Their seasons ultimately will be judged successful only if they reach the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you win your division, if you lose in the playoffs, people forget you 
won it in a few years," said Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson. "That's why you 
have to get to the Series." 
</P>
<P>
Fear of failure is the worst part of the playoff experience. Every play is 
dissected. Each pitch has the potential to change a game and a career. It can 
take months, even years, for players to get over the disappointment after a 
playoff loss. Some don't. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Moore committed suicide this summer, and some of his former California 
Angels teammates say he was haunted by his performance in the 1986 American 
League playoffs. The Angels were one out away from winning the series in five 
games, but Moore allowed a two-run homer to the Boston Red Sox's Dave Henderson 
in the ninth and gave up the winning run on Henderson's sacrifice fly in the 
11th. 
</P>
<P>
But most players are able to deal rationally with losing. Just keep them away 
from a television set. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lose in the playoffs, you have to go home and watch other teams play," 
said Joe Morgan, the future Hall of Fame second baseman who played in seven 
League Championship Series with the Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros and 
Philadelphia Phillies. "If you get to the World Series and you lose, even 
though you're not the champion, you've gone a long way and you've played in the 
last game of the season." 
</P>
<P>
It used to be worse. The playoffs began with a best-of-five format in 1969 and 
weren't extended to seven games until 1985. Under the old setup, a team such as 
the 1973 New York Mets could finish the regular season three games over .500 
and then use its marvelous pitching staff to take apart the Cincinnati Reds in 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was a crap shoot," Morgan said. "In five games, a team with 
less talent could win. But in seven games, it evens out. Better teams win 
longer series." 
</P>
<P>
But even superior teams can lose in a short series. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is more intense," said Mookie Wilson, the Toronto outfielder who 
appeared in two playoffs with the New York Mets. "The atmosphere is more 
electrified. No matter who is playing in football, no one cares. No one even 
cares what the president of the United States is doing. Everyone is focused on 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is difficult to maintain that focus every day, especially in the World 
Series. Teams often play at their peak in the playoffs. The 1986 Mets played 
sensationally to beat the Houston Astros in a six-game playoff that culminated 
with a dramatic, 16-inning contest. The World Series against the Red Sox was a 
letdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Series couldn't have gotten any better," Wilson said. "But it did -- 
for one game." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets scored three runs with two out in the bottom of the 10th to beat the 
Red Sox, 6-5, in Game 6 of the World Series. Wilson was at the plate when a 
wild pitch brought in the tying run, and he slapped a ball between Bill 
Buckner's legs to bring in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm remembered for hitting a ball 22 miles per hour," Wilson said. "But that 
happens. Everyone was watching." 
</P>
<P>
The media also play a role in the postseason. Reporters swarm the players 
before and after games. The onslaught can be overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much hype," Boston's Wade Boggs said. "There are so many 
questions. It's a circus. Everyone wants a scoop. Some guy writing for the 
Alaska Chronicle, another for the Japan Sentinel. You're asked so many 
questions that the game becomes secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes rookies take the entire postseason for granted. It goes by in a 
flash, and they never absorb the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to carry the team," said Dave Righetti, who was a rookie when 
the New York Yankees played in the 1981 World Series. "I remember being fairly 
loose. Just the normal nervousness. Maybe I didn't realize what it all meant. 
It took a while for everything to set in. The year of playing and winning in 
the playoffs helped me in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Eckersley, Oakland's top relief pitcher, said the best playoff approach 
is to remain loose and calm, soaking up the sometimes absurd elements of 
ridiculous questions, brutal travel and pressure baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that, in the back of your mind, if you don't win, your season is a 
failure," he said. "The prize makes you nervous. You're only human."

DAMEWORTH PACES AGOURA TO TITLE IN STAUB INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High shattered an 11-year-old meet record and helped 
the Charger boys' team edge a highly regarded Canyon squad for the Division I 
title at the Kenny Staub cross-country invitational Saturday at Crescenta 
Valley Park. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, the two-time defending state Division I champion, timed 14 minutes, 
50.1 seconds over the three-mile course to better the previous mark of 15:05.1, 
set by Burbank's Jeff Nelson in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Charger senior, who is undefeated in four races this season, just 
missed the course record of 14:49 that Nelson set in the 1978 Foothill League 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it, but, man, it hurt," Dameworth said. "I slowed down quite 
substantially." 
</P>
<P>
And it showed. Dameworth held a 25-meter lead at a mile (4:48) and fell off the 
pace, running the second mile in 5:09 (9:57 at two miles). He managed, though, 
to extend his advantage to 90 meters during the second mile. With a course 
record in mind, Dameworth steamed to a 4:53 in the final mile. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth's victory boosted the Agoura boys, top-ranked in the Southern Section 
2-A Division, to the Division I title, 64-69, over Canyon, the No. 2 team in 
the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Dave Hartman (15:29) and Dan Berkeland (15:36) finished third and 
fourth, but Agoura placed five runners among the top 23 finishers to turn back 
the Cowboys, whose fifth man, junior Wes Hinson, finished 28th. 
</P>
<P>
Quentin Bauer, a junior transfer from Westlake, placed sixth in 15:55 and 
junior Mike Cherman (16:29), sophomore Justin Koppel (16:44) and junior Ryan 
Golds (16:59) finished 14th, 15th and 19th, respectively, to round out Agoura's 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover's Eliazar Herrera, who had won his respective races at the Woodbridge 
and Bell-Jeff invitationals, finished second in 15:18. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Deena Drossin clocked 18:31 to win the girls' Division I race and carry 
Agoura (28 points) to the team title over Alta Loma (92) and Westlake (96). 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, plagued by shin splints, had pushed to an 80-meter lead at the 
two-mile mark (12:16), but she was unsure about the activity of the other 
runners, particularly Jeannie Rothman of Westlake, who finished second in 
18:43. 
</P>
<P>
"Until I crossed the finish line, I wasn't sure I would win," Drossin said. "I 
knew Jeannie was right in back of me because I could hear people screaming for 
her. . . . I had to stay strong." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura placed five runners among the top 10 finishers to win its second 
consecutive invitational this season.

A CLOSE CALL ON THE PENINSULA; 
</P>
<P>
ANY OF THE 4 GIRLS' TENNIS TEAMS COULD EMERGE AS A CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The CIF Southern Section ranks girls high school tennis in four divisions, from 
1-A through 4-A. Perhaps they should add a fifth: the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
division. 
</P>
<P>
All four high schools on the Hill -- Palos Verdes, Miraleste, Chadwick and 
Rolling Hills -- are ranked in the top 10 of their respective divisions and are 
located within a 10-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A division, Miraleste is No. 2, Palos Verdes is No. 3 and Rolling 
Hills is No. 6. Chadwick is ranked third in the 1-A, but just beat No. 1 
Mayfield on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins' victory over Mayfield "should shoot us up to No. 1," Coach 
Carolyn Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chadwick netters, now 5-0 in the Prep League and 7-0 overall, are a mix of 
all classes and could be the best team at the school since Leach resurrected 
the program in 1978. Last year Chadwick lost in the CIF semifinals to Corona, 
but this year the Dolphins may win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Andrea Ummel is the team's No. 1 singles player, followed by freshman 
Joanna Felton, and sophomore Patty Cho. The top doubles team is Yvette Green 
and Ivy Mollenkamp. Partners Brett Harman and Roxanne Davidovitz, Wendy Ridder 
and Sarah Ummel (Andrea's sister) round out the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more depth this year than ever before," Leach said. "Usually we have 
one or two outstanding players, (such as individual CIF champs Melissa Gurney 
and sister Cinda, but this is my best overall team." 
</P>
<P>
While Chadwick fights to become the 1-A champ, they will not face 4-A partners 
Palos Verdes, Miraleste and Rolling Hills. Palos Verdes beat Bay League foe 
Rolling Hills 14-4 Wednesday but will face stiffer competition Thursday when 
they face powerful Miraleste. The winner of that match could not only become 
Queen of the Hill, but also the CIF champion. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the series has gone to Coach Jim Hanson and his Marauders. Miraleste 
has beaten Palos Verdes six matches in a row. Palos Verdes Coach Kathy Ross has 
never beaten Miraleste. "They are sort of my nemesis," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders are sort of everybody's nemesis. They have appeared in the CIF 
finals each of the last eight years, winning it four times, most recently in 
1987. They played Corona Del Mar to a 9-9 tie in sets in last year's final but 
lost the title by five games. Corona Del Mar is currently the No. 1-ranked team 
in the 4-A. In 1982 '84, and '86, Miraleste beat Palos Verdes in the CIF 
championship. Palos Verdes returned the favor in '85, beating Miraleste for its 
last CIF championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky to have so many kids from a tennis background. Most of them belong 
to clubs and have been playing for a while," Hanson said. His current team is 
6-0, "but hasn't been tested." Miraleste beat No. 5-ranked Estancia 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
Like Chadwick, Miraleste has no superstars but is deep. The top singles player 
is senior Erica Hansen. Other returning starters are Erica's sister Christa and 
Laura Bak-Boychuk, both juniors. Kristin Keller and team captain Andrea Ballard 
form the top doubles team, while sophomores Darcy Sepko and Sonia Lee "have 
improved immensely." 
</P>
<P>
Although Miraleste has breezed through its early schedule, Palos Verdes 
stumbled in its very first match against Corona Del Mar. It was a battle of Sea 
Kings as the Corona Del Marversion beat Palos Verdes. "My kids were a complete 
mess," Ross said. "They were so nervous and Corona Del Mar had already played 
six or seven matches." 
</P>
<P>
Ross hasn't let the loss affect her team. She didn't change the lineup or have 
her team play against each other in challenge matches. "I set the lineup, I 
think they should get mad at me and not at each other," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings won the CIF championship in 1983 and '85, but have not appeared 
in the finals since 1986, when they lost to Miraleste. In '88, Palos Verdes 
lost to Corona Del Mar in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday's match against Miraleste may portend Palos Verdes' outcome this 
year. If the Sea Kings win, and Miraleste goes on to beat No. 1 Corona Del Mar 
in an Oct. 25 match, they will have a realistic chance at the title. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said she will wait until the playoffs to rank anybody. "The rankings are 
based on last year, they really don't mean anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross says she has no No. 1 player, but top players include senior Sheila Moore 
and juniors Melanie Fountain, Paully Hackathorn and Lorren Fotesta. 
</P>
<P>
Most teams with 6-3 records and a No. 6 ranking would consider themselves doing 
very well, but at Rolling Hills, Coach Tom Cox says his team "is hanging 
tough." All three losses have been to ranked opponents: Palos Verdes, Edison, 
and San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't get easier for the Titans either. They must play Palos Verdes again, 
Miraleste twice and Corona Del Mar. They have already beaten Top 10-ranked 
Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I scheduled some horrendous opponents," Cox said, meaning extremely 
competitive teams. "But so far I've been pleasantly surprised. You never know 
what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
If the Titans have it tough this year, the future is promising. Rolling Hills 
starts four freshmen at times, and has only two seniors on the team, Saki Homma 
and captain Shay Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 player is freshman Stephanie Lansdorf, followed by junior Mia Ho and 
freshman Michelle Tojiri. Sophomore doubles partners Cindy Siu and Jenny Lynn 
took two out of three sets against Palos Verdes. Freshman Laura Chodzko and 
sophomore Jeannette Virtue are the No. 2 doubles team, and sophomore Yuri 
Miyata and freshman Robin Feuer are No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
With a month to go in the regular season and then the playoffs, Cox said what 
the other three coaches on the Hill could say, decribing the rest of their 
seasons: "I'm excited, we control our own destiny."

EL CAMINO EASILY POWERS ITS WAY PAST GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's little doubt after Saturday's Mission Conference win over Golden West 
College that El Camino College will dominate the rest of its opponents this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Warriors (4-0, 3-0) seemed capable of anything in their 38-14 
victory over Golden West (2-2, 2-1), a team they tied last year. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino was so dominant that Coach John Featherstone put in his second-string 
quarterback and defense in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? with 14:50 left to play, the Warriors already had a 31-point lead. 
Might as well give sophomore quarterback Frank Dolce a rest. He had already 
completed 22 of 28 yards for 300 yards and 4 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
With 8:20 left in the third quarter, El Camino scored on a five-play, 93-yard 
drive. Running back Alfred Lowe scored on a two-yard touchdown run and Dolce 
threw to Khevin Pratt for the two-point conversion to give the Warriors a 31-7 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino scored on its last touchdown early in the fourth quarter when Dolce 
passed to David Blakes for a 29-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West scored on its second touchdown with less than a minute left to play 
when third-string quarterback Ron Ramirez hit Robert Bedford for a nine-yard 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our running game is what kept them off balance," Featherstone said. 
"We ran so we could get our big plays through the air." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors were on a roll from the start. They scored on their first 
possession, which came after Anthony Anetema intercepted a Rip Flippo pass down 
the middle. Golden West drove 30 yards in four plays before turning the ball 
over to the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino capped a five-play, 61-yard drive with a 16-yard screen pass from 
Dolce to Al Savea for the first score of the game. Louis Perez' point-after 
kick put the Warriors up 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Perez made a 27-yard field goal on the Warriors' next possession to make it 
10-0. The Warriors got the ball when Ed Togia recovered Corey Dickson's fumble 
during a punt return. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors marched 32 yards, including a three-yard touchdown run by Dolce 
that was called back on a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino scored a touchdown on its next possession, though. The Warriors drove 
52 yards in eight plays and Perez' point-after kick made it 17-0. Dolce threw a 
16-yard touchdown pass to Shannon Thompson for that score. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West finally scored with 11:20 left in the half, thanks to an El Camino 
fumble by Alfred Lowe on the Golden West 15-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Rustler defensive lineman Robert Erena recovered the ball and Flippo hit Patric 
Reilly for a 15-yard touchdown pass on third-and-ten. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino answered with another touchdown. It came after a nine-play, 78-yard 
drive that was capped by Dolce's 25-yard pass to David Blakes. That gave the 
Warriors a comfortable 23-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors take their Mission Conference show to Chula Vista next week where 
they face unranked Southwestern, a 28-0 loser to Rancho Santiago.

MIRALESTE BREAKS 20-YEAR DRY SPELL WITH VICTORY IN WATER POLO TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miraleste High School repulsed a late Santa Monica rally Saturday night to win 
its first El Segundo South Bay Water Polo Tournament at Urho Saari Swim 
Stadium. It was the first time Miraleste has won the tournament in the event's 
20-year history. 
</P>
<P>
With the Vikings down 10-9 and 53 seconds to go in the game, Santa Monica 
goalie Martin Wagmeister blocked an Andy Foster shot to give the Vikings the 
ball. But Santa Monica's bid to put the game into overtime ended when the 
Miraleste defense forced a 25-foot shot, easily blocked by sophomore goalie 
Fritz Mahron. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to play and we didn't," Viking Coach Niall Skehan said. "They 
out-matured us. We had a chance to win the game and one guy decided he was 
going to play by himself." 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, ranked seventh in the Southern Section 2A poll, improved its record 
to 10-3. Santa Monica fell to 12-4. Kyle Hildebrand of Miraleste was named the 
tournament's most valuable player for his outstanding play in the two-meter 
position and on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lapse defensively in the second half, our players were depending to 
much on Kyle," Miraleste Coach Chick McIlroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste was leading 8-4 with 2:31 to go in the third period, but then gave up 
three consecutive goals to the Vikings, including a 65-foot shot by goalie 
Martin Wagmeister to end the third quarter. Santa Monica trailed 8-7 with 5:05 
left in the contest, but could not tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Youngrens, who led all players with five goals, scored two goals in the 
last three minutes of play to give the Marauders the winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's Reza Izad scored the first goal of the game to give the Vikings 
the only lead it would have. The teams traded goals until Youngrens drilled a 
10-foot shot past Wagmeister with 17 seconds to go in the second quarter to 
give Miraleste a lead it would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
In the third place game: 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa 8, Loyola 6 -- Mira Costa goalie Joe Boyle blocked seven Loyola 
shots in the fourth quarter to lead the Mustangs to a surprising third-place 
finish in the 16-team field. Earlier in the tournament Mira Costa held 
Miraleste to 5 goals in a 5-2 semifinal loss. The five goals were the lowest 
point total scored by Miraleste in tournament action. Miraleste reached the 
final by beating Chadwick 14-9, Glendale 12-8, and Mira Costa.

NOTRE DAME TAILBACK NURSES FOOTBALL WITH ONLY A MINOR MISCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Farmer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Setefano Malieitulua is not quite ready for that after-school job at the 
nursery, but he is improving. 
</P>
<P>
You see, to the Notre Dame High junior, carrying the football is tantamount to 
toting a tyke. Both are precious. Dropping either could have dire consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drop the ball, people are going to start looking down on you," he said. 
"Like if you drop a baby, people think you don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Malieitulua, normally a fullback, obviously cared Friday when he filled in for 
injured tailback Errol Small. Although he fumbled the ball away once, 
Malieitulua gained 144 yards in 20 carries, caught three passes for 44, and 
scored twice in a 33-6 win over St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt kind of nervous because I have more responsibility, a lot to remember 
and I'm getting the ball twice as much," he said. "After the first series I 
felt comfortable, and all I was worried about was holding onto the ball, 
following my blocks and running as hard as I can." 
</P>
<P>
And running as hard as Small. 
</P>
<P>
"During school, most of the coaches told me I had to squeeze the ball," 
Malieitulua said. "They all told me this is my time. I had to show them that I 
am also from Notre Dame, that there isn't just one person to look for." 
</P>
<P>
Wish you were here: Four of the Valley's top running backs were sidelined 
because of injuries Friday. Michael Jones of Montclair Prep was out with a 
bruised knee and Notre Dame's Small with a deep thigh bruise. Ontiwaun Carter 
of Kennedy played for one quarter but also left with a thigh bruise. Mike 
Lindsay of Thousand Oaks had swelling in his knee. All are expected to return 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, Small, and Carter represent a combined 1,874 yards and 23 touchdowns 
this season. Lindsay, who gained 1,046 yards last year, has gained 111 yards in 
22 carries in two games this season after undergoing knee surgery in the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Irresistible force: Defensive players looking to separate Sylmar running back 
Jerome Casey from his faculties had better think twice. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Jerome, who says that he has yet to wince from a big hit. And the 
T-shirt he earned for bench-pressing 425 pounds serves as a reminder that he 
can handle the surliest of smart-talking defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Reasoned Casey: "Why worry about what he says? I know what I can do to him . . 
. They say, 'Take that,' and 'You ain't anything,' and all that crap. But I 
don't let that stuff get to me. I just laugh it off and come back and punish 
him. Leave him something to think about next time. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can stop me." 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham defenders certainly couldn't Friday. Casey (6 feet, 185 pounds) 
rushed for 218 yards in 17 carries, caught two passes for 75 yards, and scored 
twice in Sylmar's 27-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a body of a 24-year-old guy," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said. "It's 
etched. He's a cut above, a phenomenal person. He's a man." 
</P>
<P>
Braves Coach Chick Epstein was more impressed with Casey's mobility than with 
his muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"Get him outside and he's gone," he said. "We don't have any speed to even come 
near that." 
</P>
<P>
Split personality: After each of his magnificent runs -- and there were many 
Friday against St. Genevieve -- Derek Sparks was greeted with congratulatory 
helmet slaps and a chant of "USC! USC!" from teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, normally the fullback, played tailback because of Jones' injury. He 
carried the ball just 11 times against the Valiants but gained 215 yards and 
scored six touchdowns in the 55-14 win. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks, a junior, says that he would relish a chance to play for the Trojans. 
Still, he diplomatically sidesteps the question of where his loyalty lies. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like USC," he said. "But I like the Bruins, too. Hey, UCLA -- that's 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Nice juke, Derek. 
</P>
<P>
Think big: Having the entire Montclair Prep defensive unit run through an 
interception drill in pregame warm-ups is somewhat like practicing an 
acceptance speech before an award is given. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties did perform the not-too-confidential exercise in confidence before 
playing St. Genevieve, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's being cocky. I think when you come out and know that this 
is going to happen, it makes it that much better," said Sparks, who was lofted 
a pass in the drill and returned it behind a wedge of teammates for a would-be 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks was right. The Mounties picked off four St. Genevieve passes and had 
returns totaling 80 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday morning referee: Canyon quarterback Tim Beidle attempted to throw 
downfield with 30 seconds to play in the first half Friday night but the ball 
was deflected back to him without touching the ground by a Mission Viejo 
defender. Beidle then threw a second pass to a streaking Clint Beauer who 
caught the ball for a 50-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a touchdown or an illegal forward pass? You make the call. 
</P>
<P>
Although throwing two forward passes on one play is illegal in college and 
professional football, it is legal in a high school game, according to National 
Federation rules. The play was correctly ruled a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, because of a new rule, a defender could not have been called for 
pass interference against Beauer on the second pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all just sort of amazed," Beauer said of the play. "I just shot deep 
and he got the ball there. It was a weird thing. (Mission Viejo was) mad and I 
just looked at them and said, 'Hey, that stuff happens.' I was laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Sticky fingers: On his first reception of the game, Beauer broke Canyon's 
all-time reception yardage record set by Chad Zeigler (1,486 yards) in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Beauer, who caught five passes for 83 yards against Mission Viejo, has 98 
receptions for 1,575 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that you always think about when you're a little kid," Beauer 
said of the record. "As soon as I caught the (first pass) I pretty much knew. 
Then, I heard the loudspeaker. It went in one ear and out the other, and from

LINCOLN GETS THE MESSAGE, WINS 'WAR' WITH MORSE

<P>
Vic Player, Lincoln football coach, called them bonehead mistakes. Of course he 
was talking about fumbles, interceptions -- turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the first half of Saturday night's Lincoln-Morse war -- and it was a 
war -- was filled with turnovers, the halftime score was only 6-3, Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But then something happened in the Lincoln dressing room and the Hornets came 
out sure of themselves and, better yet, sure-handed. They parlayed three 
third-quarter touchdowns into an eventual victory, 26-10. 
</P>
<P>
Just what was said at halftime? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a professional secret," Player insisted. "And besides, if I told you 
I'd probably get fired." 
</P>
<P>
But, really, what was said.? 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty much the same thing I always say at halftime," Player relented. "And I 
told them to stop making those bonehead mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
One player in particular heeded Player's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
That would be wide receiver Dwayne McAfee, who caught the only touchdown pass 
of the first half, then came back and caught another late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McAfee's first touchdown came on a 60-yard pass play from Mike Temple, but the 
ball actually traveled only 25 yards in the air, McAfee's leg work brought it 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
McAfee, a 5-foot-7, 150-pound senior flanker, caught the pass at the Morse 35 
on the left sideline, but quickly changed directions and headed for the right 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"Morse plays very aggressive defense," McAfee said of his decision to head 
toward the opposite sideline. "They pursue very quickly and I knew if I caught 
the ball and cut, they might over pursue in the other direction." 
</P>
<P>
The Tiger defense did just that as McAfee ran into the right corner of the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
McAfee's second TD came with 3:31 left in the third quarter on a one-yard 
timing pass from Temple that again caught the Morse defense unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
"With three great backs, Charlie Brown, Doug Boyd and Terrell Davis, defenses 
try to key on them too much -- and that's when the passing game gets clicking," 
McAfee said. 
</P>
<P>
Clicking indeed. It was Lincoln's third touchdown in five minutes, the second 
on a short pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Davis scored the first of the three from one yard out. Just two and a half 
minutes later, and after Brown and Davis chipped away 29 yards on four 
consecutive running plays on a drive that began after Morse fumbled the ball to 
Lincoln on the 30, Victor Dean grabbed a one-yard pass for the second TD. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of touchdowns effectively knocked Morse (2-3 and ranked third in the 
section) out of the game. The Tigers did not get into the end zone until five 
minutes had elapsed in the fourth quarter. Glen Steele scored that one by 
recovering a Jessie Campbell fumble behind the goal line to make it 26-10. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was costly for Lincoln (4-1, ranked fourth) as four starters were 
lost to injuries. Davis sustained a dislocated shoulder, Boyd reinjured an 
ankle, and Donald Anderson (cornerback/punter) and Thomas Baker 
(linebacker/tight end) went down with back injuries. Player said all are 
doubtful for next week's City Central opener against Crawford.

USD DRUBS POMONA PITZER TO GO 5-0

He probably waited until no one was around. He might have even locked himself 
in a closet somewhere to insure his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But at some point after the University of San Diego's 31-6 drubbing of Pomona 
Pitzer Saturday afternoon, you get the feeling USD Coach Brian Fogarty let out 
a whoop and a holler and maybe even danced around in circles, clenching his 
fists while pumping his arms up and down. 
</P>
<P>
Normally subdued, Fogarty probably lost control for a moment or two -- like a 
golfer who just drained a 63-foot chip shot on the 18th hole to win The 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a huge victory for USD. It was not handsome. Whopping numbers do 
not come jumping off the stat sheet. Few players, if any, dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a victory, USD's fifth in as many games. And for Fogarty, it 
represented a breaking even. In seven years at USD, Fogarty is now 31-31-2. 
</P>
<P>
His team is ranked No. 4 in the NCAA Division III West Region and has a shot at 
the playoffs for the first time since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a team," a reserved Fogarty said. "We've come through in every phase 
of the game. I don't think it's the most talented team we've had, but as a team 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
Tim Oder, the defensive line coach, said, "The whole team's playing well. Some 
of the kids that are playing, if you'd have told me six months ago they'd be 
out there, I'd have quit. (They are) pretty run-of-the-mill type kids who are 
playing their butts off." 
</P>
<P>
And winning. 
</P>
<P>
USD is averaging 25.4 points per game and allowing only 8.4. Against Pomona 
(1-2), USD built a 31-0 lead midway through the third quarter before 
substituting freely to the delight of a Parent's Day crowd of 1,840 at Torero 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, USD only attempted two passes in the second half. Saturday, the 
Toreros threw once in the final 30 minutes, a 20-yard scoring pass from backup 
quarterback Doug Piper to reserve Brad Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Jackson rushed for 116 yards in the first half. (He carried once for one 
yard in the second half). His two touchdowns, on runs of one and 29 yards, and 
Ty Barksdale's eight-yard scoring run gave USD a 21-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard's touchdown and a 38-yard field goal by Dave Bergmann made it 31-0. 
Bergmann has made 10 of 13 attempts this season; his next will equal the school 
record set by Robert Lozzi in 1981 and '82. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bradley, Lenny Territo and Mark Crisci each had an interception. 
Bradley's, after a 17-yard return, gave USD a first and goal at the five and 
set up its first touchdown. Territo's, at Pomona's 21, set up its final 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Not always the case in the past, Fogarty pointed out, "The defense knows now 
that if they get the ball back, the offense is going to put it into the end 
zone."

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE PAYOFF IN MAKING SOVIETS OUR CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid reports of economic and political turmoil, prominent Americans are 
streaming to the Soviet Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board goes this weekend to advise Soviet leaders on reforms for their sclerotic 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Then next week, 142 U.S. companies will open a giant commercial exhibition in 
Moscow, to run Oct. 17-25. Organizations as varied as Monsanto chemicals, Estee 
Lauder cosmetics and the California almond growers will seek new business -- or 
look to expand their already considerable, but little noticed, business in the 
Soviet market. 
</P>
<P>
That may seem like bad timing. The explosions of freedom have come so fast to 
Eastern Europe that the fear now is of tanks rolling to keep East Germans from 
fleeing to the West, or Poles from governing themselves or even to overthrow 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and put an end to his economic reforms. However, 
things are not always what they seem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Logic Favors Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
Logic says the tanks won't roll and that Gorbachev won't be overthrown either. 
Think about it. If the tanks roll, the Soviet Union would have to increase 
support for its East European satellites -- even the best of which, East 
Germany, is kept afloat today only by billions of dollars slipped in from West 
Germany. The Soviet Union doesn't have enough these days to help itself, not to 
mention Poland. 
</P>
<P>
And logic also favors Gorbachev because he's the guy who stands for change, and 
young Soviets in all parts of the economy, including the military, want change. 
The immediate problem is that after decades of paying people whether they 
worked or not, the economy doesn't produce enough goods for people to buy, and 
rubles are piling up. Money that can't buy anything loses its value -- which is 
why the ruble is now worth less than 6 cents on the black market, compared to 
$1.62 officially. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the Soviet Union can't turn back the clock, because economically 
there is nothing to turn back to. Therefore it must modernize and move into the 
world economy. And one way Gorbachev proposes to do that is to bring in foreign 
expertise and capital. There will be a great welcome in Moscow for the U.S. 
companies next week. 
</P>
<P>
And the companies are eager to be there, because the Soviet Union is already 
good business. By the estimate of a U.S. business expert, 300 American 
companies do from $20 million to $200 million each in annual sales in the 
Soviet Union. That means total business might be $30 billion a year and more -- 
almost equal to U.S. exports to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Why haven't you heard about that? Because the official trade figures show only 
the $2 billion or so of Russian grain purchases. The real story, though, is 
that trade figures no longer reflect the global economy. The goods and services 
that the Soviets buy are not exported from the United States but are supplied 
by foreign divisions of U.S. global companies. The Soviets pay with hard 
currency earned by selling lumber or oil or other raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Ventures 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, however, the lack of convertible currency limits the business. 
That's why U.S. firms are interested in joint ventures: By helping Soviet 
customers upgrade their economy, they may enlarge the market. 
</P>
<P>
Some ventures are already working. Combustion Engineering, of Stamford, Conn., 
is helping chemical plants in western Siberia increase their output by 
supplying instrumentation and software. It gets paid a percentage of the 
increased production. Honeywell Inc.'s Austrian subsidiary is supplying process 
controls for ammonia fertilizer plants. 
</P>
<P>
In a venture dating to 1972, Pepsi Cola now sells 35 million cases of Pepsi in 
the Soviet Union. It gets paid in Stolichnaya vodka, which it sells at a 
premium price in U.S. liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
A newer wrinkle, still, is Monsanto's laboratory where Soviet scientists do 
biotechnology research in joint operation with Monsanto. The venture represents 
a $500,000 research expenditure for the St. Louis-based company, and helps 
cement a relationship that brings in roughly $100 million in annual sales of 
other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Ventures in biotechnology indicate the reach of Gorbachev's ambitions. He wants 
an advanced economy, skilled in computers and information sciences, that in 10 
years will be able to stand on its own feet as a global competitor -- instead 
of the cripple that it is today. Note: In no sense is he stepping back from a 
long-term rivalry with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Should U.S. companies and the government help today's cripple? Our 
response, says Sen. Bill Bradley, (D-N.J.), should be that of a rational 
capitalist, calculating what is in our interest. 
</P>
<P>
And on balance, Soviet economic progress is the lesser of two evils. The Soviet 
economy today, says Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, "is near chaos -- and we've 
never had a chaotic superpower. The gross unpredictability of such a country 
would be a grave danger." So, better a competitor that is playing by our rules. 
With peristroika, in other words, we may not lose an adversary, but we could 
gain a customer.

THE TAX CUT DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
SOME LAW MAKERS FAVOR LIBERALIZING IRAS. OTHERS WOULD TRIM CAPITAL GAINS 
LEVIES. WHICH IS BETTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE PICKETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress is considering two approaches to cutting taxes. One plan, pushed by 
the Bush Administration and passed late last month by the House, would cut 
taxes on capital gains for two years to encourage long-term investment. A 
counterproposal offered by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) would broaden tax 
benefits for people putting money into individual retirement accounts. Which 
approach would do the most good for the most people and for the overall 
economy? Times researcher Melanie Pickett interviewed experts on the topic. 
Excerpts of their comments follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Reich, professor of political economy at Harvard University's John 
F. Kennedy School of Government: 
</P>
<P>
There's absolutely no evidence that (the capital gains tax cut proposal) will 
stimulate productivity or net new investment, simply because it applies to 
investments already made. The primary beneficiaries unquestionably are people 
with incomes over $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another important aspect of this new reality, should the Republican plan be 
enacted, is that lower- and middle-income taxpayers would be shouldering a much 
greater burden. Not only because they'd be paying more in order to make up for 
what high-income taxpayers are not paying, but also because their Social 
Security payments, even now, are being applied to budget deficit reduction. And 
the Social Security payments, of course, are very regressive. They apply to the 
first $43,000 from dollar No. 1 of earnings. Mike Milken last year fulfilled 
his Social Security obligations at 18 minutes past midnight on Jan. 1, to give 
you some example on how regressive this entire system is. If you put the 
Republican tax reduction on capital gains together with what's happening in 
Social Security, you come up with a tax system that is the most regressive we 
have had in the last 75 years and the most regressive tax system of any 
industrialized nation. 
</P>
<P>
As to the Democrats' plan, it's not that much better. IRA deductions are 
already available to families (with incomes) lower than $50,000, so all this 
does is extend IRA deductions to families with incomes greater than $50,000. 
And although in Los Angeles that may feel like middle class, that's actually 
upper-middle class in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of stimulating savings, the jury is out on the Democrats' plan. The 
evidence we have as to whether IRAs actually stimulate new savings is 
ambiguous. And different studies tend to show different things. 
</P>
<P>
The average middle-class taxpayer loses by the Republican plan and doesn't gain 
anything by the Democrat plan. The upper-middle-income taxpayer gains a bit 
from the Democratic plan because IRAs can be deducted. He gains very little 
from the Republican plan. The 600,000 wealthiest individuals in the country 
stand to gain a great deal from the Republican plan because this enables them 
to shelter more of their income and to sell their assets at windfall rates. 
</P>
<P>
David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union: 
</P>
<P>
Either proposal can help the economy, again as long as they're not paid for by 
raising marginal tax rates or by making some other harmful change. But it's 
equally important that Congress control the spending so the deficit doesn't 
balloon. It's not commonly known, but the government is still getting a huge 
amount of new revenue each year from economic growth and some tax increases 
that have already been built into the system. So even with changes such as the 
capital gains tax rate reduction or even an extended IRA deduction, in the 
grand scheme of things, the government is still going to be getting a big 
increase in revenue from year to year. Even with these so-called tax cuts. But 
whatever changes are made by either plan, the changes in the economy will be 
fairly minor. Simply because the cuts themselves are fairly small when you 
compare them to the size of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
If you just look at the tax due at the bottom of the 1040 form, it's possible 
more people might claim an expanded IRA deduction than would benefit from a 
capital gains deduction. But I haven't seen the numbers on that and I don't 
know how they would compare. I wouldn't be surprised if they were pretty close 
to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Alice M. Rivlin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and currently a 
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution: 
</P>
<P>
I think both are pretty dubious propositions. The tax reform of 1986, which 
gave us a much more equitable income tax, was a good thing. And eroding it by 
making additional special provisions, whether for capital gains or for IRAs or 
whatever, is unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit is a long-run problem. We need to be worrying about how to bring 
the federal deficit down. It doesn't make sense to take short-run revenue 
increases (as more investors sell assets to take advantage of lower capital 
gains taxes) at the expense of long-run losses. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence A. Krause, San Francisco financial planner and author: 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that people are tax motivated. When they took away the tax 
incentives from IRAs, the sales went down substantially. The change in 1982, 
(expanding tax deductions for IRAs), showed that people who swore that they 
could never put money aside indeed could, given the right incentives. And it 
made investors out of people who previously were just savers. 
</P>
<P>
Is that good for the economy? In the long run, of course. In the short run, 
maybe it was negative as far as taxes go, maybe it didn't bring in the revenue. 
But you can't tell me that by teaching people to save and invest, that's bad in 
the long run. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing holds true with regard to capital gains. By taking away capital 
gains incentives, you're taking away motivation. 
</P>
<P>
The little guy, if he's motivated to save money in the first place, for example 
through the IRA, then maybe he can take advantage of capital gains, too, down 
the road. But he has to have the incentives to do that. 
</P>
<P>
What boggles my imagination is that you'll talk about something that will add 
to the deficit or bring in less revenue by -- pick a number -- $3-, $4- or 
$5-billion on one side of the coin, and on the other side of the coin you talk 
about a savings and loan debacle of $160 or $200 billion -- and that's waved 
over like a wand. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schuyler, an economist with the Institute for Research on the Economics of 
Taxation: 
</P>
<P>
It's desirable for the economy to lower the capital gains tax rate. It's also 
desirable to return to the broader IRAs we had before the 1986 tax act. So in 
contrast to what some people are saying on Capitol Hill, I do not regard the 
IRA proposal as in any way a substitute for a lower capital gains rate nor do I 
think that expanded IRAs on their own merits are a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
What I really would like to see would be a reduction in the real capital gains 
tax rate and, to prevent inflation from covertly taking back some of the 
reduction, I would also like to see capital gains indexed for inflation. If I 
had my druthers, I think I would prefer that the capital gains tax be 
abolished. But short of that, a lower rate and inflation indexing so inflation 
does not produce fat gains which people have to pay real taxes on. 
</P>
<P>
The Bentsen IRA proposal is not as good as the old law because the 
deductibility would be only 50% for people who are single and have incomes over 
$35,000 or (for joint filers who earn) over $50,000. They would have to fill 
out informational forms every year they paid this partially 
deductible/partially non-deductible IRA. Based on the information forms that 
presently have to be filled out for the non-deductible IRAs, which many people 
are saying are complicated, it would be a burdensome thing for taxpayers. Also, 
taxpayers have the problem that when they have a mixture of deductible and 
non-deductible contributions, they have to keep records until they begin to 
make withdrawals, which could be a generation from now. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's proposal to allow people greater ability to make withdrawals is 
desirable in the sense you want to encourage people to save for their own 
retirements -- to exercise more responsibility. And actually I think people 
left to themselves tend to do that very well. One of the problems we've had is 
the tax system creates a strong bias for people to consume immediately and 
short-change the future.

TOUGHER LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL MEAN BIGGER PROFITS FOR DRUG DEALERS, NOT 
DECREASED USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan is to be congratulated for the courage and good sense shown in 
his Sept. 3 column ("Drive Down the Profits in This Business"). Unfortunately, 
no one is listening. As a professional economist, I liken the illegal drug 
trade to a business. 
</P>
<P>
There is not one shred of evidence that the current drug policy is working or 
that more of the same will work. The obvious evidence is what has happened to 
the street price of drugs. Prices, particularly for cocaine, have dropped. 
Hardly the result expected if our efforts had actually restricted the supply of 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to see the problem is to assume for a minute that our 
efforts actually do reduce the supply of illegal drugs. What are the most 
likely effects? First, the street price would go up. This means that addicts 
will feel compelled to steal more from the rest of us to maintain their habits. 
Second, the profits of those with drugs to sell will increase. Potential drug 
dealers are nothing if not sensitive to the profit motive. Accordingly, the 
increased price ought to attract new sellers. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever shut down a market by making it more profitable, yet that is 
exactly what is being proposed! 
</P>
<P>
Complete legalization is not the answer. This is as simplistic and as silly as 
the current policy of complete prohibition. All drugs are not the same. We can 
probably live with the problems caused by the widespread use of marijuana. PCP 
and other such drugs are quite another matter. Selective decriminalization and 
differential taxation, however, may be part of a viable effective drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
We do have experience with legalization. Before the first decade of this 
century, most drugs, including opiates, were legal and cheap. We apparently did 
have a significant proportion of the population addicted. This was a tragedy 
for the addict and his family but not for society. Criminals did not usually 
fight over and get rich on the drug trade. Many addicts were able to live 
productive lives in spite of their addiction. We should be so lucky today.

<TEXT>
<P>
James Flanigan made an excellent analysis of cash flow and profit structure of 
the illegal cocaine business. He should have left it at that, rather than 
wandering into those vague generalities regarding results if legalization were 
to take place. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it: William Bennett and President Bush (perhaps less flamboyantly) 
are Rambos in business suits. Earmarking billions of dollars for materiel and 
"advisers" for Colombia and more cops and jails at home gets their adrenaline 
going; using those billions for inner-city education, economic improvement and 
treatment for addicts would be so boring. 
</P>
<P>
I guess it's easier to utilize the existing defense resources than to set up a 
complex, legal import-licensing-distribution organization. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mr. Flanigan's opinion that "this time the users wouldn't be adult 
drinkers but kids," what on earth makes him think a legally controlled system 
would permit sales to minors?

HUD LOAN IN LAGUNA SCRUTINIZED; 
</P>
<P>
WEINBERGER, FRIEND MAY HAVE PUSHED FOR VISTA ALISO FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the urging of then-Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, former Housing 
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. overruled his staff to 
approve a $4-million housing project for the elderly in Laguna Beach, according 
to the Newsday newspaper in Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Newsday reported that the 71-unit project -- called Vista Aliso -- was ranked a 
low priority by Department of Housing and Urban Development staff and was not 
in line for program funding, according to a handwritten memo by Pierce 
assistant Silvio deBartolomeis dated Sept. 1, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But the aide, noting that Weinberger had written to Pierce endorsing the 
project, recommended that Pierce skirt the low ranking by using his 
discretionary fund for the project, according to HUD records. The records 
included another handwritten memo to Pierce from his top aide, Lance Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rocked by Scandal 
</P>
<P>
For several months, HUD has been rocked by a scandal that includes charges of 
influence peddling and has raised the question of whether Pierce has approved 
projects because of politics, not merits. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce gave the Visa Aliso elderly housing project -- which opened in April, 
1988 -- an initial loan of $2.9 million, which later swelled to about $4 
million, according to Reed Flory, the consultant who won HUD's backing for the 
project. Flory is president of Shelter Ventures in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the application process, Flory told The Times, the sponsor of the 
project -- St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Laguna Beach -- was required to 
obtain reference letters from as many prominent officials as possible. In 
addition to Weinberger's letter, he said, the church's application included 
letters from both of California's U.S senators as well as former Rep. Robert E. 
Badham (R-Newport Beach) and Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Flory said he believed that Robert Morse, a member of the church, knew 
Weinberger and when the project was proposed, asked that he write a letter in 
support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Morse, who lives in Laguna Niguel, declined to comment to The Times on 
Saturday. "He is my friend, and I have no comment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberger, who worked in Ronald Reagan's gubernatorial administration in 
California in 1968 and 1969, is a former treasurer of the state's Episcopalian 
Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Flory told The Times that he has no knowledge of Weinberger's letter making any 
difference in the church obtaining funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Flory credited Weinberger's helping hand with getting the project unstuck. 
"It was going nowhere when we first proposed it in 1981," he told Newsday. "So 
I instructed every person involved to get support wherever they could. It 
turned out one of the members of St. Mary's Episcopal Church either worked or 
went to school with Cap (Weinberger), wrote to him, said this was a good 
project, and Cap responded." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Pierce have used their Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination in refusing to answer all questions put to them in recent 
weeks by the House panel investigating the scandal at HUD, where fraud, waste 
and influence-peddling to win HUD money allegedly ran rampant during the Reagan 
Administration. Neither Pierce nor Wilson could be reached for comment on the 
Laguna Beach project, which came to light in documents from the files of Pierce 
assistant Deborah Gore Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, refused to comment "specifically on actions 
that the secretary (Weinberger) may or may not have taken." 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's was listed as a project sponsor, according to HUD documents, but a 
church spokeswoman said that only the former rector, who could not be reached, 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Among the HUD reforms being considered is the abolition of the secretary of 
housing's discretionary fund, from which grants or loans can be made without 
having to run the normal gantlet of review.

The Garden Grove City Council will hold a special public meeting Tuesday on the 
banning of so-called safe-and-sane fireworks within city limits. The council 
will consider recommendations from the fire department and other organizations 
that the possession and sale of such fireworks be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove is one of the six Orange County cities that still allow the sale 
of such fireworks. The other cities are Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, 
Orange and Santa Ana. The Westminster City Council approved a ban in September, 
but the Fullerton City Council last week rejected banning the fireworks on a 
3-2 vote.

POSSIBLE MOVE OF SALCIDO TO UCI IS QUESTIONED

<P>
SANTA ROSA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor has raised security concerns over the proposed temporary transfer 
to UC Irvine of Ramon Salcido, charged in the wine country slayings of seven 
people. Salcido's attorney wants the transfer so a brain scan can be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Sonoma County Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Bumerts filed a motion in Superior Court 
alleging that the experimental brain scan, called Positron Emission Tomography, 
has not been accepted as a court standard. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to make sure that for such a security risk there is a real reason 
for this to occur," Bumerts said. A hearing has been set for Tuesday before 
Judge R. Bryan Jamar. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Marteen Miller said such a test is "critically important in 
saving (Salcido's) life." 
</P>
<P>
Salcido, 28, could face the death penalty if convicted of the April 14 killing 
rampage, which resulted in the deaths of his wife, two of his three daughters, 
other relatives and a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary brain test has indicated that Salcido has a right temple lobe 
disturbance, Miller said, although he did not elaborate on that condition.

Valley Christian 26, Orange Lutheran 6 -- Orange Lutheran was held scoreless 
until 28 seconds remained. 
</P>
<P>
With time running out, Orange Lutheran quarterback Lenny Gavin threw a pass 
intended for junior wide receiver Phil Matheson. Valley Christian defensive 
back Todd Harrison tipped the ball, but Matheson came away with it en route to 
a 62-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first touchdown Valley Christian has yielded in three weeks, said 
Coach Mike Wunderly. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Christian opened the scoring at the start of the second quarter on a 
one-yard run by Mark Kortenhoeven. The senior running back carried the ball 20 
times for 130 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Chris Miller ran five yards for the second touchdown with 46 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Miller then connected with senior Sam Sybesma on a nine-yard touchdown pass 
with 8:55 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Orange Lutheran's record to 2-3 overall, 0-2 in the Olympic 
League. Valley Christian is now 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 21, Orange 0 -- Estancia High School's defense posted its fourth 
shutout in five games at Fred Kelly Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia tailback Josh Wojtkiewicz gained 143 yards in 25 carries, and scored 
on a 10-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia took a 7-0 lead in the third quarter. Quarterback Danny Ucker passed 
to Mike Aulet for 31 yards, and three plays later, Ucker scored on a seven-yard 
keeper with 4:25 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Burrows ran for a 28-yard score on the next series. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (5-0) has allowed only one touchdown this season, that coming in the 
second game of the season against Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Estancia defense was led by interceptions by Ty Hilbert and Oliver Wright, 
and sacks by Jeremie Chapin and Kevin Thomas. 
</P>
<P>

CURTAIN RISING ON FINAL ACT IN STRUGGLE TO SAVE WHITTIER THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future appears bleak for the crumbled, old Whittier Theater, a 
once-beautiful Depression-era film palace and centerpiece of the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Tom Mauk said he is prepared to ask the City Council to go ahead 
with plans to finish demolition of the historic theater, a shambles since it 
was damaged in the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake and then was partially demolished 
by a wrecking ball. It would be too costly for the city to repair the movie 
house, at the corner of Whittier Boulevard and Hadley Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mauk said an environmental impact report released last week supports the 
arguments of city officials who want to raze the theater. 
</P>
<P>
But local preservationists claim that the report, prepared by a Los Angeles 
consulting firm, is "junk," and city officials have no appreciation for the 
community's historic resources. 
</P>
<P>
The final act to save the theater is scheduled to be played out in City Hall 
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., when the council takes public testimony on the issue. The 
battle will be the biggest yet for the Whittier Conservancy, a powerful 
citizens group that for two years has fought with legal might to rehabilitate 
the Spanish-style theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take this thing to the max," said Helen Rahder, spokeswoman for 
the conservancy, formed after the 1987 earthquake. "Demolition should be the 
last option. The city has a responsibility to protect its historic resources." 
</P>
<P>
The theater would cost about $2.6 million for a developer to acquire and 
repair, according to the Environmental Impact Report, which the city was forced 
to prepare under a Superior Court order obtained by the Conservancy. According 
to the report, the city should be prepared to contribute at least $500,000 to 
make the deal appealing to an investor, an expenditure that Mauk said he 
adamantly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gene Chandler said he will not vote to save the theater if it means 
the city must "go out on a limb" financially. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a great lover of that theater anyway," Chandler said. "I don't know 
who in the world would want to come up with the money to restore it." 
</P>
<P>
Mauk said that so far no developer has expressed an interest in rehabilitating 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It would cost half a million dollars just to clean up the asbestos in the 
building" if rehabilitation is pursued, Mauk said, adding that he doubts anyone 
would want to invest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater is a blight, it's a disgraceful blight," Mauk said. "The silent 
majority is not so silent anymore. The support is there to eliminate the 
blight." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the future of the theater has been emotionally charged since 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the temblor, city building inspectors ordered the demolition of 
the theater because they said it was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
A wrecking crew worked on the theater for about 45 minutes before lawyers for 
the Whittier Conservancy arrived with a restaining order to stop the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David Dickerson had successfully argued in court that the city had to 
obtain an environmental impact report before razing the theater. According to 
the California Environmental Quality Act, an environmental impact survey must 
be conducted before a historic building can be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The city fenced off the theater and its fate has been in limbo since. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is owned by Peter Doerken, a developer who bought it in June, 1987, 
for $1.1 million. He initially planned to convert it to a performing arts 
center. But shortly before the earthquake, he asked the council to allow him to 
demolish the theater and and put a $14-million shopping center on the site. 
Doerken has said he would not rehabilitate the movie house, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the demolition after listening to public testimony, 
Mauk said, the city attorney will return to court and request that the 
restraining order be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Once the order is lifted, the theater will be razed, probably within the next 
few months, Mauk predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rahder said the conservancy is looking for loopholes to keep the 
city from demolishing the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"The historic resources of this community have dwindled horrendously," Rahder 
said. "Yes the theater is a blight. . . . But when renovated it will stand out 
like a jewel."

WELL-DRILLING FIRM CLARIFIES ITS DISPUTED LETTER OVER OIL REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A company that wants to sink up to 30 oil wells in Hermosa Beach has clarified 
a letter that opponents charge gives misleading figures about how much revenue 
the city of Redondo Beach has received from wells there in the last 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson Oil Co., based in Santa Monica, has a prospective contract with the 
city to sink wells at the city maintenance yard at Valley Drive and 6th Street. 
Its plan has come under attack before the Planning Commission, which is holding 
hearings on a draft environmental impact report for the project and a 
conditional-use permit for it. 
</P>
<P>
Company President Don Macpherson Jr., in the disputed letter that was sent to 
residents in late August, stated that "in the 33 years of production, Redondo 
Beach has generated over $70 million in oil revenue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memo to Council 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson clarified the letter in a memo to City Council members last week. He 
wrote that his letter "did not state, nor was it intended to imply, that the 
city of Redondo Beach has generated over $70 million in oil revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the letter meant to give Macpherson's estimate of the total value of 
the oil retrieved from the field under Redondo Beach. Macpherson said his 
company arrived at the dollar amount by multiplying the average per-barrel 
price of oil each year since 1956 by the production for that year, then added 
the annual revenues. Records show that 8.8 million barrels of oil have been 
recovered from Redondo Beach since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheila Schoettger, Redondo Beach's harbor director, the city has 
received about $14 million as its share of oil revenues over the 33 years. The 
city's contract calls for it to receive 18% of the tidelands and 2% of the 
upland oil revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Extrapolating from the Redondo Beach experience, Macpherson said that because 
oil costs more today, Hermosa Beach in the next 35 years stands to make an even 
greater royalty than Redondo Beach has. Macpherson said based on a city 
consultant's figure for the amount of oil underground, he estimates that the 
city would receive $22.8 million in 1989 dollars. The consultant, Richard 
Hester of Glendale, estimated that there are 9.4 million barrels of oil under 
Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson's own consultants, however, estimate the reserves at three times 
that. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the city awarded Macpherson a 35-year lease to drill for the oil. 
Under the present contract, the city would receive 18 2/3% of the revenue from 
the sale of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson's clarification letter was prompted by comments of two drilling 
opponents who had challenged the figures at a recent hearing before the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's not just misleading, it's false," George Sacks said. "Any 
clarification like that doesn't correct it, it just proves it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Production Has Fallen Off' 
</P>
<P>
Brent Harris, a financial analyst and opponent of the project, said that how 
much Redondo Beach received is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether (the revenues) are $70 million or not, it is clear that (Redondo 
Beach's) production has fallen off dramatically" and this has significance for 
Hermosa Beach because Redondo Beach is draining oil reserves from under Hermosa 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the State Lands Commission, in a letter to then-Hermosa Beach City 
Manager Gregory Meyer, concluded that wells in Redondo Beach were drawing oil 
and gas from deposits under Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Oil production in Redondo Beach has dropped to about 45,000 barrels a year, 
down from a peak of 705,000 in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
But Macpherson said that Redondo Beach only could have drained oil from the 
border lands between Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach and that the bulk of the 
deposits remain untapped. 
</P>
<P>
The current arguments are the latest in a dispute over whether the city should 
go ahead with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, in a letter to the City Council, estimated that the city could lose 
money on it. He said Macpherson's estimates of oil prices are overly 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burdened by Costs 
</P>
<P>
Harris also said the city would be burdened by the costs of buying and cleaning 
up the South School, as well as relocating the city maintenance yard. Under the 
current plans, the city would move maintenance work elsewhere to make way for 
the drilling rig, while a portion of the South School site would be used by 
Macpherson for an oil separation facility. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson said Harris' estimates are "riddled with errors, omissions and false 
assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
In a response to Harris' estimates, he said that if the project is 
unsuccessful, the city would not suffer a loss because it is not investing the 
money for the project. He also said that the city's purchase of the South 
School site would have no effect on the revenue it would receive from the 
project and that the project could go forward without the site. He also said 
the maintenance yard could continue at its present location unless it needs to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach City Manager Kevin Northcraft said the city is planning to 
purchase the South School site regardless of the oil project. They are 
negotiating the purchase with the Hermosa Beach City School District.

NO BILLING AND COOING FOR SECRETARIATS WITH WINGS; 
</P>
<P>
OWNERS CONSIDER RACING PIGEONS TOP ATHLETES BUT TO MANY NEIGHBORS, THEY'RE JUST 
DIRTY 'FLYING RATS' 
</P>

<P>
Quietly, before the neighbors awaken each day, dozens of South Bay residents go 
out to their dew-laden back yards to enjoy a sport that has been getting some 
of them in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Whistling and clucking softly to their athletes, they round up a practice team 
and send them winging away. After a few darting circles, the team disappears 
into the morning sky. 
</P>
<P>
Pigeon racing, often regarded as a barnyard sport, has been a little-noticed 
part of city living for decades. Enthusiasts say more than 90% percent of all 
American pigeon racing takes place from lofts tucked away in city and suburban 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
As cities have grown and people have moved closer together, however, pigeon 
racers have begun to ruffle their neighbors' feathers. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, the feud between racer and neighbor has blossomed into a 
full-scale pigeon war. 
</P>
<P>
Two pigeon racers in the last three months have faced City Council hearings on 
whether they should be allowed to keep their birds. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Paul Woehlcke, won a narrow victory but has decided to move from the 
South Bay, in part because neighbors remain angry at his 75 birds. 
</P>
<P>
Council members reached a six-month compromise on the second racer, Roger 
Mortvedt, that requires him to reduce his flock from 100 pigeons to 60 and 
limits how often they may fly. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, Vince Orefice, testified to the City Council on behalf of his 
racing colleagues and now fears for the future of his own birds because he has 
been ordered to apply for a city pigeon-keeping permit. 
</P>
<P>
Without the permit, Orefice would be allowed to keep only four pigeons, far 
fewer than the 50 or 60 birds South Bay racers say they need to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
If any neighbors complain, Orefice could face city hearings on his flock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a New Battle 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the South Bay's roughly 70 pigeon racers is not new. 
</P>
<P>
A similar fight flared in Manhattan Beach four years ago when a pigeon racer's 
birds were accused of messing up neighbors' yards. In Torrance, pigeon fanciers 
were banned in 1965 from keeping more than four birds after a man who trapped 
and bred wild pigeons in Hollywood Riviera allowed his flock to sit -- and drop 
-- on a neighboring Superior Court judge's house. 
</P>
<P>
The law remained unchanged until February of this year, when Mortvedt and 
Woehlcke, threatened with losing their flocks, persuaded the City Council to 
approve a special permit allowing the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Many South Bay cities have laws banning large flocks of domestic pigeons, but 
the fanciers who race the birds in those cities either aren't aware of the laws 
or believe that they won't be enforced if owners keep a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Several anti-pigeon Torrance residents, still smarting from their two council 
defeats, have founded a new community group they call RAP -- Residents Against 
Pigeons -- to make sure the issue remains high-profile. 
</P>
<P>
In a newsletter that sports a logo of a chirping bird with a black line through 
it, the group insists that pigeon breeding should be banned from densely 
populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Citing health studies that say pigeon guano can carry a number of dangerous 
airborne diseases, RAP argues that each pigeon racer endangers scores of his 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Form of Poultry Raising 
</P>
<P>
"It's a form of poultry raising. We have only 6,000-square-foot lots, so we're 
living on top of each other here," said David Brent, one of the group's 
founders. "This belongs on a farm. Pigeon breeding in a congested area like 
ours is not appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Mortvedt's outraged neighbors agree. A parade of them appeared before the 
Torrance City Council last month to complain about droppings in their yards, on 
their cars and in their pools. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like a prisoner in our own home," said John Perparas, who lives two 
houses away from Mortvedt. "They do defecate in flight. I have seen them." 
</P>
<P>
Perparas complained that when it comes time to sell his house, he will be 
forced to disclose information about Mortvedt's pigeons to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Which house would you buy?" he asked the Torrance City Council during debate 
over the pigeons. "The one with 100 pigeons next door or the one without?" 
</P>
<P>
Racers, however, say their birds are the victims of mistaken identity by 
observers who assume that wild pigeons seen roosting around the neighborhood 
are actually a domestic flock. 
</P>
<P>
"To most people, a pigeon is a pigeon is a pigeon," said Joe Arrigo, the 
Manhattan Beach racer who in 1985 won a city permit to keep his flock. "The 
public attention is drawn to all these birds that are nuisances, like the ones 
in parking lots and on public buildings that are not controlled. They do make a 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
Domestic racing pigeons are about as similar to the average wild "flying rat" 
pigeon, fanciers insist, as a plow nag is to Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Bred Athletes 
</P>
<P>
"They're highly bred athletes, born for racing," Mortvedt said. "They don't 
hang out on fences and wires messing up the neighborhood because they're 
trained not to do that. You can win or lose a race by seconds, so you don't 
want them to get in the habit of hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
Racing pigeons released for exercise flights and races have not eaten in 
several hours, breeders say, leaving nothing for them to drop when they take to 
the skies. 
</P>
<P>
"When any bird flies, it's to his advantage to be as light as possible because 
when his weight is heavy it requires a lot of energy," said Cornell University 
pigeon researcher Irene Brown. "Consequently, when birds take off, they usually 
relieve themselves of their droppings before they even leave the premises." 
</P>
<P>
RAP members aren't convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not supernatural birds that are so well-controlled that they can hold 
it back forever," Brent said. "When you've got to go, you've got to go, and 
they circle the neighborhood and they do it." 
</P>
<P>
It is the perception that their birds are the scourge of their neighborhoods 
that has made pigeon racers throughout the South Bay a wary group. 
</P>
<P>
During the racing season, which runs from September to November for young birds 
and from April to June for the older pigeons, racers from throughout the South 
Bay gather on weekends at their Hawthorne clubhouse -- a borrowed room in the 
American Youth Soccer Organization's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Many racers interviewed during the preparations for a recent race from Fresno 
to Southern California told a reporter that they didn't want their names used 
because it might attract attention to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my birds for 15 years and some of my neighbors still don't know 
they're there," one racer said. "Why would I want to create a problem where 
there isn't one?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Each Bird Is Special 
</P>
<P>
For many of the men -- only three or four of the South Bay's roughly 70 racers 
are women -- pigeons are an essential part of their lives. Although racers 
usually only name a handful of their flock, each bird, they say, is special to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of them as humans. Each one has a personality all its own," said Danny 
Hinds, 62, a retired Sun Valley bread truck driver who now makes his living 
taking truckloads of racing pigeons from the South Bay and Orange County 
hundreds of miles to distant release points. 
</P>
<P>
"One I named Mongoose, because he was a sneaky little devil. I've got one I 
call Bull Durham. He's a mean bird," Hinds said. "They just fascinate me, all 
of them. I mean, they only weigh 16 ounces, and they've got the heart of a 
lion." 
</P>
<P>
After several practice releases at increasing distances from their home loft, 
birds enter their first 100-mile race when they are only a few months old. The 
racing distance is increased roughly 50 miles each weekend of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The night before a race, competitors take 15 or 20 of their birds to the 
clubhouse, where $500 racing clocks are synchronized and each pigeon is fitted 
with a numbered elastic leg band before being placed in spring-loaded holding 
crates. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty or so birds are placed in each crate, with males separated from females 
to prevent any "hanky-panky" during the long trip to the release site, one 
racer explained. The crates are then fitted onto special trucks equipped to 
open all the doors at once at the start of a race. 
</P>
<P>
During the preparation hours for a race, enthusiasts trade tips and enjoy some 
good-natured banter. Occasionally, the fastest birds trade hands for as much as 
$1,000 to become breeding stock in a new loft. Such sales are rare, racers 
insist, because young birds are often given away to help a new racer get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do this for the money," Mortvedt said. "If I was going to be paid by 
the hour for what I put into these birds, I'd be a rich man. The greatest thing 
for me is to win and be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whir of Beating Wings 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, trucks from several clubhouses meet at the assigned 
release point, which can be as far away as Oregon. After a short countdown, the 
crate doors spring open and a confusion of competing birds, sometimes as many 
as 15,000, thunder out in a whir of beating wings. 
</P>
<P>
Looking like a swarm of bees searching for a hive, the pigeons circle the 
release point several times, climbing higher and slowly getting their bearings. 
Eventually they dart off, racing at speeds up to 60 m.p.h. toward their distant 
lofts. 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists have discovered that homing pigeons can detect many things 
humans cannot -- infrasound that is inaudible to the human ear, ultraviolet 
light that is invisible to thehuman eye and magnetic fields that are not 
detectable by the human body -- they still are not sure how pigeons pull all 
this information together to find their home loft. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem is, how do pigeons know where they are relative to home?" 
Cornell researcher Brown said. "It's one thing to get the compass headings down 
and know which way is north and south and all that, but how do they know which 
way is home? We've never found a pigeon carrying a little map showing where the 
release point is relative to home." 
</P>
<P>
As the birds filter down toward Southern California, owners who live closer to 
the release point call their more distant colleagues to report that the birds 
are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious South Bay owners, warned by San Fernando Valley racers that the birds 
are coming in, stand in their yards ready to urge the arriving pigeons quickly 
into their home loft. 
</P>
<P>
Catching each bird as it arrives, the owner slides off the pigeon's elastic leg 
band and pops it into a chamber in his racing clock, where the time is recorded 
and sealed until a club official reads the results. 
</P>
<P>
The pigeon that covers the greatest distance in the least time, measured as 
yards per second, is declared the winner. It's not uncommon for some birds to 
travel more than 60 m.p.h. for an entire day to reach their loft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bird Was Too Fast 
</P>
<P>
In a recent race from Fresno, one of Roger Mortvedt's pigeons came home so fast 
that he wasn't ready for her. The 6-month-old bird had been in the loft nearly 
a minute, he said, before he sealed her leg band in his clock. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the delay, the unnamed pigeon won second place -- out of 12,000 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
After 31 years of pigeon racing, such results are not uncommon for Mortvedt, 
president of a three-club coalition called the Southern California Racing 
Pigeon Combine, which covers Los Angeles County from west Los Angeles through 
the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Mortvedt achieved the pinnacle of American pigeon racing: a national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Only four or five such champions are selected each year in several age and 
competition categories, based on their record of victories and their speed 
during races. Mortvedt's champion -- which, like most of his other birds, is 
nameless -- is now kept locked away as part of his breeding stock. 
</P>
<P>
Mortvedt's success also makes it even harder to think that he might have to 
give up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
During his fight with the city, he had to send his birds to other lofts for a 
few weeks. Mortvedt cannot discuss that experience without tears welling up in 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Anne, and their seven children have agreed that the family will move 
from Torrance if the council turns down a permanent permit six months from now. 
But one son desperately wants to finish high school here. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put the pigeons ahead of my son . . . and yet you're so torn," 
he said. "They are an important part of my life." 
</P>

several times as they climb and slowly get their bearings for their flights 
home. ; Photo, Roger and Anne Mortvedt check on some of their prized racing

ONE-DELI TOWN;

WHILE PASTRAMI WARS RAGE ELSEWHERE, A LONELY OUTLET STRUGGLES 
</P>

When New York's Carnegie Deli opened a spot in Beverly Hills this summer, the 
kitchen ran out of food the first day. At Juniors Deli in Westwood, there is 
standing room only. They say an elderly man once fainted in the packed lobby of 
Nate 'n' Al's in Beverly Hills, and when they revived him, he wanted to know if 
he'd lost his place in line. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much business out there it's ridiculous," Juniors' owner Marvin 
Saul said. 
</P>
<P>
Except in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deli Wars Raging Countywide 
</P>
<P>
The deli wars are raging all over Los Angeles County, but in Long Beach, they 
haven't even fired a shot. 
</P>
<P>
There are still people in Long Beach who have never tasted a bagel. ("I've 
heard bagels are just like rocks.") People in Long Beach who fear bagels. ("Do 
I have to have my sandwich on a bagel?") 
</P>
<P>
There are Italian delis and Chinese delis and submarine-sandwich shops that 
call themselves delis. But when it comes to a New York-style, Jewish deli where 
you can find a decent knish, Long Beach is a one-deli town. And the one deli in 
Long Beach is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Long Beach are marvelous. You would not believe the number of 
Gentiles who come in to wish me a happy New Year," said Bert Markovitz, owner 
of the Bagel Bistro, the only traditional Jewish deli in the city limits. "It's 
a shame I have to make a living. Otherwise, I would enjoy this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can It Be Truly Cosmopolitan? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Long Beach has the World Trade Center. Sure it claims to be "The most on 
the coast." But if a city does not cry out for a restaurant where the smell of 
pastrami and hot dogs hits you in the face, where the waitresses ignore you and 
make your life miserable, can it ever be truly cosmopolitan? 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach is virgin territory, you'll forgive the expression," Saul said. 
"The San Fernando Valley didn't exist until it got a half-dozen delis. It's 
part of being cosmopolitan. It's part of being avant-garde. You can't be 
anywhere unless you've got a decent deli." 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the fact that a sizable number of Jews migrated from Long Beach 
to Orange County years ago. Deli mavens say their customers include "yuppies, 
yippies, blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Italians -- you name it, we've got it." As 
the late Leo Steiner, who made New York's Carnegie Deli famous, put it: "Who 
doesn't know chopped liver?" 
</P>
<P>
"A nice Jewish lady explained it to me," said Belle Markovitz, Bert's business 
partner and wife. "Long Beach was settled by a bunch of people from Iowa and 
they didn't know delis from nothin.' But I don't believe it. Long Beach is a 
beautiful city. It's so centrally located. It just isn't ethnic." 
</P>
<P>
The Markovitzes had been running delis for 35 years, from Manhattan to the 
Bronx to Encino, when they moved to Long Beach a couple of years ago with every 
intention of getting out of the deli business. It was a virtual act of mercy 
when they opened the Bagel Bistro at 45th and Atlantic in Bixby Knolls, a 
storefront operation with a case full of knockwurst and a room full of red 
tables, most of them empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early-Morning Start 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around and said, 'Where you gonna get a dozen bagels when you're 
having people over?' " said Belle, a friendly woman with a red apron who gets 
up at 4 every morning to start baking bagels. She knows her customers not by 
their first names but by what they like to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell your sister I said hello," Belle said, handing $6.52 worth of creamed 
herring and rye bread to a stooped lady in her 80s who was admiring the olives. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my sister," the lady said, the cuffs of her pants rolled up around her 
blue sneakers. "She fractured her hip and that was bad, and then the next thing 
she did she fractured her vertebra and I had to call 911 to get her up." 
</P>
<P>
"Well my dear, you have a happy and healthy New Year," Belle said 
sympathetically. 
</P>
<P>
It was 4 on a Tuesday afternoon, three days after Rosh Hashanah and six days 
before Yom Kippur, and the counter girl was already sweeping up. At the same 
time in New York, the customers would have been lining up for an early dinner 
or a couple of pounds of corned beef to take home, Belle said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Years Without One 
</P>
<P>
For 39 years, Cohen's Deli thrived on East Anaheim Street in Long Beach, but 
business was dwindling when it closed in 1985. Two years passed before the 
Bagel Bistro opened and for two years Long Beach did just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Harmatz, who founded Cohen's and has since retired to Lakewood, said he got 
too old to eat deli food and he thinks the rest of Long Beach did, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Older people can't eat that stuff," Harmatz said. "Everything is pickled, 
smoked and cured. When you pass the 50 or 60 mark, you gotta watch yourself." 
</P>
<P>
But many people insist there is a demand for good deli food in this town and 
that, in fact, some Long Beach residents drive as far away as Beverly Hills for 
brisket. Others just suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss a good juicy corned beef sandwich. I love pastrami. I love tongue," 
said Long Beach City Councilman Evan Braude. "I can't tell you how many times 
I've thought of opening a deli myself. But I'm too busy doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
Bert and Belle Markovitz would stack their pastrami against anything you buy in 
Los Angeles. The trouble is, a lot of people in Long Beach, including Braude, 
do not know his place exists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sprouts and Decor 
</P>
<P>
Storefront delis like his might make it in New York, Juniors' Marvin Saul said. 
But in L.A., people want sprouts and decor. "You have to give them a little 
schmaltz," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach still has some growing up to do, its civic leaders admit, and a 
Midwestern image to shake. But it won't be a chicken pot pie city forever. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Saul declared. "I love Long Beach. I was there last Spring. When I retire 
and give Juniors to my sons, I'm going to open another restaurant and Long 
Beach will be the place. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes half a million people to support one big deli. Long Beach has what, 
400,000? In another 10 years, Long Beach will be ready for one big Juniors." 
</P>

COUNCIL EXPANDS AIRPORT TAKEOFF LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance residents who live under the flight pattern of the city's municipal 
airport have successfully lobbied the City Council to extend the hours of the 
airport's takeoff curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted unanimously to ban takeoffs after 10 p.m. and before 7 
a.m. on weekdays and before 8 a.m. on weekends and holidays. Previously, the 
city had banned departures between 11 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. on any day. Landings 
may take place at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes just one loud noise over your home to wake you up," Mayor Katy 
Geissert said. There are "far more people . . . are affected by that" than 
there are those pilots and members of the airport community who will be 
affected by the curfew change, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots who fly certain quieter aircraft may apply for special permits that 
allow takeoffs during the curfew in "life or death" emergencies and for 
pressing business needs. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision came despite an Airport Commission recommendation against 
any change and recommendations by the Transportation Department and Building 
and Safety Department for more lenient action. 
</P>
<P>
Airport commissioners voted 4 to 2 in June not to change the curfew. The city's 
Transportation Department had recommended extending the morning curfew from 
6:30 a.m. to 7 a.m., whereas Building and Safety officials recommended the 11 
p.m. to 10 p.m. change. The two departments later compromised to recommend a 7 
a.m. weekday and 8 a.m. weekend curfew, leaving the night curfew time 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots and business owners at the airport complained that the tighter rules 
would sap the vitality of an already weak airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it doesn't seem like much for the airport people to give up, it 
really is. The airport already is on the skids," said Ted Stinis, spokesman for 
the Torrance Area Pilots Assn. "We are in a precarious situation. Don't push us 
over the edge of viability." 
</P>
<P>
After listening to a number of residents complain about the disruptions caused 
by late night and early morning plane flights, council members agreed that 
stricter measures were needed to protect the neighborhoods surrounding the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
The council noted that the new rules will bring Torrance Municipal Airport's 
curfew rules in line with those in use at other airports in the area, including 
Santa Monica, Van Nuys and John Wayne airports.
