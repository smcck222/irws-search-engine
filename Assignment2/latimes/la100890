SKINHEADS, PUNKS PUSH ANTI-RACISM MESSAGE TO PEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jason has been a skinhead since he was a teen-ager, dressing the part and 
advocating the strong working-class ethic that has been at the heart of the 
movement since it began in England back in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Jason, 22, grew up in Ocean Beach and works as a tool grinder for the company 
where his father works and where his uncle worked before him. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has stopped shaving his head, the tattoos etched on Jason's arms -- 
one reads "skin," the other "head" -- make his allegiance clear, if often 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got people at work who won't talk to me because they classify me as a 
skin and that I'm racist," said Jason, who asked that his last name not be 
used. "I'm a skinhead, but I'm not racist." 
</P>
<P>
Jason and his 22-year-old wife, Dawn, a self-proclaimed skinhead since the 10th 
grade, are members of the new San Diego chapter of Anti-Racist Action, a 
national anti-racist organization of skinheads and punks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the group has been here only for the past six months, members are 
plastering pockets of San Diego with "Smash Racism" posters and scattering 
flyers at music shops to explain what they're all about, give directions to 
their twice-monthly Sunday meetings and invite people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 people -- including blacks, whites, Latinos, Cubans and Jews -- have 
been attending the meetings, held wherever room can be found, members said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope a Nov. 10 self-promotion concert to be held near the San Diego 
State University campus will also attract people. 
</P>
<P>
Although Anti-Racist Action is new to San Diego, the group has chapters 
scattered all over the country, including New York, Chicago and other cities on 
the West Coast, said Leonard Zeskind, research director for the Center for 
Democratic Renewal in Kansas City, which monitors extremist groups that espouse 
racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
"The ARA is a legitimate anti-racist youth group," Zeskind said. "Any 
anti-racist strategy that is serious has to talk to them (skinheads) in terms 
that are their own language and by their own peers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to spreading the word that punk and skinhead groups were 
anti-racist from their beginnings, this loosely knit core of people wants to 
clean up the local punk music scene, where concerts and shows have been 
littered by racial incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to a show and the dance floor -- as it is lightly called -- is 
dominated by two or three people who like to wear swastika T-shirts and are 
built like football halfbacks, and they decide to dominate a show, it affects 
me and other people," said ARA's San Diego founder, 38-year-old George Matiasz, 
who is not a skinhead but has been part of the punk scene since 1979. The 
group's aim is "to educate people that racism isn't cool and to take control of 
your own scene." 
</P>
<P>
What the group hopes to eventually accomplish doesn't stop there, however. Once 
it has more members and is more organized, Matiasz said, it plans to hold shows 
with music, poetry readings and other entertainment to raise money for 
community groups or political causes that are anti-racist in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Matiasz, a longtime activist in political movements and what he calls 
anti-authoritarian issues, said he felt it was time somebody tackled the racism 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to deal with the issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the basic thing of doing by example. It's not good enough to have the 
truth but to make an example of your life and your scene." 
</P>
<P>
The skinhead movement began in the late '60s as a clique of working-class kids, 
both white and black, who, through their dress code of work boots, shaved heads 
and jeans, promoted the tough working-class image they wanted to be affiliated 
with, said Eric Anderson, a professor at Yakima Valley Community College in 
Washington state, who wrote his master's thesis on skinheads in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The skinheads were also a reaction to the hippies who came out of the middle 
class about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The racist stigma traditionally attached to skinheads came about during the 
1970s, when the economic situation in England worsened and the working class 
with which the skinheads had always identified became a class without work, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Some skinheads turned their resentment toward black and immigrant workers 
because they believed they were taking jobs away from them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
People familiar with Anti-Racist Action say it can work to keep young people 
from joining racist skinhead groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of people in the scene who aren't full-blown racists but throw 
around racist slurs," said another group member, a 24-year-old who calls 
himself Stinky Panch. "It would help to tell people not everybody likes to hear 
those words and maybe keep people from becoming Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
Racist skinheads are often neo-Nazis who condemn homosexuals, communists, 
minorities and others they fear are contaminating America and threatening the 
American way of life, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although they haven't had any problems yet, Matiasz and others in the San Diego 
ARA said they fear they might one day have a run-in with some of the white 
supremacists who follow men such as Fallbrook's Tom Metzger, national leader of 
the White Aryan Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you do good work, you hurt someone, and we're going to try to hurt 
racists," Matiasz said. "And these people are not known for their genteel 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said he has merely befriended racist skinheads and is not their leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Metzger is not the guru of the skins, never was and never claimed to be," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, group members say, they want to start doing more than just talking 
about fighting racism. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope to grow and get anything done possible," said Stinky Panch. 
"Anything is progress."

With the ever increasing problems that plague Los Angeles, such as the 
homeless, gangs, the drug traffic that runs rampant on our streets and schools, 
the insufficient police allocations, the insufferable housing conditions for 
the poor, the jammed freeways and the pathetic treatment of the aged, it is 
superfluous to even attempt to justify Tom Bradley's excessive travel under the 
pretense of stimulating foreign trade and enticement of foreign travel to Los 
Angeles.

I have noted your articles on Tom Bradley's travel. Without that travel, we 
would not have had the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, and without his 
travel, our tourism and trade figures in Los Angeles would not be as good as 
they are.

The tobacco industry obviously hasn't gotten the word yet that the Cold War is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
They're still bent on killing the so-called "red commies" in the Soviet Union. 
Their weapons are disguised in bright alluring packages and they are sending 
millions of these time bombs, known as cigarettes, over to the Soviet Union, 
(Part A, Sept. 14). 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco companies will make a lot of money from this gesture of greed. Is 
this American capitalism at its best?

CRISTIANI'S PLEA FOR CONTINUED MILITARY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a shock to see the commentary by President Cristiani. The numbers killed 
by the military totally ignored, no recognition of the concrete changes vitally 
needed, no mention of the tremendous support of the population for an end to 
military impunity and petitions for meaningful negotiations, no statement of 
wages frozen since 1980, no comment about the bombing of crops and civilian 
communities in rural areas when combat with guerrillas are miles away, no plans 
for education, no program for medical care regardless of political perspective, 
no realization of land issues, no plan for freedom to move within the country 
or of association.

The president of El Salvador is seeing his situation through rose-colored 
glasses. He should come to Los Angeles and live incognito and learn from his 
fellow Salvadorans just how "so-called" the democracy is in that country. He 
can try to "red herring" us by pointing out actions of FMLN or actions by his 
forces done to discredit FMLN, but he cannot conceal the overwhelming use of 
killing and torture done by forces under his direction.

THURMOND AND 'LOVELY LADIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ellen Goodman's column ("Insult, Thinly Cloaked in 'Chivalry'," Commentary, 
Sept. 28) deserves a response. The intent, rather than the perception, of Sen. 
Strom Thurmond's greeting to the not-so- "lovely ladies" who appeared before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee prompted Sen. Alan Simpson's desire to clarify 
his colleague's statement. 
</P>
<P>
The panelists included leaders and spokespersons for women's rights and 
feminist organizations -- women, in fact, who have little in common with, nor 
represent, the overwhelming majority of American females. 
</P>
<P>
Our country was built and grew to greatness on a family value system. I believe 
in that system and I ask those panelists: "Are we (women) really better off now 
(since the liberation movement)?" 
</P>
<P>
How many of their children, their neighbor's children, or children across town 
are illiterate because many of our traditional values regarding family and 
child rearing have been cast aside in favor of contemporary life styles? For 
every woman who takes motherhood casually, there are at least 10 others who 
work and struggle to keep their family together. 
</P>
<P>
Women and men are not equals. We are different. Our bodies do not look alike 
nor do they function alike. Achieving equality in government, the business and 
professional worlds, academia or before the courts does not mean that we should 
cast off the unique characteristics that distinguish our sex.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cristiani praises himself for participating in U.N.-mediated negotiations with 
the FMLN, and for signing a human-rights agreement. However, he fails to 
mention that he unilaterally declared the military a non-negotiable item. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that the military, not the FMLN, has committed a countless 
number of human-rights violations during the past 10 years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
He criticizes the FMLN for demanding the expulsion of 200 military personnel. 
He never says that the reason the FMLN wants these officers expelled from the 
military is that they are all accused of committing gross human-rights 
violations against the people of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani also fails to mention the fact that everyone in El Salvador from 
students, to campesinos, to businessmen, and other political parties supports 
the FMLN's demands.

CRISTIANI'S PLEA FOR CONTINUED MILITARY AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your very timely and accurate editorial on continued military aid 
for El Salvador ("Congress: Don't Fall for It," Sept. 25). Unfortunately, 
neither you nor Congress has taken a strong enough position. 
</P>
<P>
The war is not only, as you say, "ugly and unwinnable" -- but totally immoral. 
You condemn the military as having "too much political clout" when, in fact, it 
has total control of the politics of the country. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one way to force the military to negotiate honestly with the FMLN 
and to respect the human rights of the Salvadoran people, and that is to 
discontinue all, not just half, of the proposed $85 million in aid. 
</P>
<P>
Until Congress stops supporting the Salvadoran military, congressional hands 
will be stained with the blood of the Salvadoran people.

PITTSBURGH GETS FAT WHEN CHARGERS GO FLAT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: STEELER OFFENSE FINALLY REACHES END ZONE -- FOUR TIMES -- IN 
36-14 VICTORY. CHARGERS FALL TO 1-4.

<TEXT>
<P>
There were tears in Joe Walton's eyes, and you can understand why. The Chargers 
were leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, the Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive coordinator, had been under fire for 
directing a go-nowhere offense that had not produced a touchdown in the first 
month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But after playing the Chargers in Three Rivers Stadium in front of 53,486 fans 
Sunday, the Steelers had a 36-14 victory, and Walton was honored with a game 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious the Steelers have offense," Coach Dan Henning said, "or we're not 
as good on defense as we think we are." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (2-3) scored its first touchdown of the year eight seconds into the 
second quarter on Bubby Brister's eight-yard pass to rookie tight end Eric 
Green. Once they understood there was nothing to it, the Steelers went on to 
score three more. 
</P>
<P>
The team's 36 points, which also included a safety and a pair of Gary Anderson 
field goals, was more than it had scored in its previous four games -- 32. It 
was also the most points scored against the Chargers (1-4) since last year's 
season opener, when the Raiders posted 40. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as flat as I have ever seen this team," linebacker Gary Plummer said. 
"And it's an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
Flat or flattened? 
</P>
<P>
"We just got our butts kicked," safety Martin Bayless said. "It was almost as 
if we weren't even on the field. It's bad, real bad, and it has to change real 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
While rebuilding under new General Manager Bobby Beathard this season, the 
Chargers were to buy time with a defense that ranked sixth at the end of last 
year. But in the past two weeks, opposing offenses have rung up 54 first downs 
and 797 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose a football game, it's one thing," Henning said, "but we had a 
similar type of performance last week; they just didn't score points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned by it (defense) all week. I think our players and our coaches 
need to be concerned about it. That's an area of our football team that we 
thought is strong, and we've been leaning on it. It needs to reach down and 
find out what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, who entered the game 28th in the NFL in offense, had the ball 18 
minutes and 14 seconds longer than the Chargers and went 12 for 16 in 
third-down conversions. 
</P>
<P>
Brister, who was playing with a painful rib injury, completed 11 of 14 passes 
for 132 yards and a pair of touchdown passes to Green. And he was not sacked. 
</P>
<P>
Brister left the field for examination before halftime, and second-year 
quarterback Rick Strom played the rest of the game and was seven of 11 for 68 
yards. Together, they were 18 of 25 without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't play the way we're playing," defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said. "We 
can't give ourselves an opportunity to win if we can't get people to even punt 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't conceive or foresee that it could get any worse than this." 
</P>
<P>
As several of the Chargers suggested Sunday, this is a team in disarray. It 
lacks enthusiasm. It has no consistency on offense and suddenly too many 
deficiencies on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not very good right now," Henning said. "We have to go back and find out 
what kind of heart, what kind of character, what kind of fortitude that we 
have. We have to go back to work and dig that out, and those that have it will 
shine. It may be a great test for us and chance for us to find out what kind of 
people we do have on this team." 
</P>
<P>
There will be no up-close-and-personal look at quarterback Mark Vlasic, 
however. He remains a backup, Henning said. And no, he said, he never 
considered replacing Billy Joe Tolliver with Vlasic Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If he could have played linebacker or defensive back, maybe he would have been 
a help," Henning said. "If he could have taken guard Courtney Hall's place, or 
if he could have caught the ball . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If I thought Vlasic would solve our problems on this football team right now, 
we would put him in there," he said. "I don't think he will." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, while victimized by a number of dropped passes, completed 11 of 29 
for 121 yards, including a two-yard scoring flip to linebacker Gary Plummer, 
who had lined up in the backfield as a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
But Tolliver also threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same song, different verse," Tolliver said. "I just don't know what 
to say." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver led the Chargers on a 64-yard opening drive in reply to Anderson's 
45-yard field goal, and they took a 7-3 lead on third and goal from the two 
with his rollout pass to Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
After Brister ignited a second-quarter celebration with his touchdown pass to 
Green, he did it again on the next series with a one-yard shot to the same man. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers lost cornerback Rod Woodson in the first half with a thigh bruise, 
safety Thomas Everett with a back sprain and then Everett's replacement, Larry 
Griffin, with a hamstring pull.

<P>
Dwayne Woodruff stepped into Pittsburgh's makeshift secondary and intercepted a 
Tolliver pass intended for Anthony Miller at the Charger 38 on the third play 
of the third quarter, then returned it to the 15. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Warren Williams ran left four plays later for a two-yard touchdown 
to build Pittsburgh's lead to 24-7. Williams had replaced Tim Worley, who also 
left in the first half with an ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' final score came when defensive lineman Les Miller fell on a 
Williams' fumble in the end zone with 3:52 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
But Pittsburgh was not finished. Former Charger linebacker Tyronne Stowe 
blocked a John Kidd punt for a safety 3:13 into the fourth quarter, Anderson 
hit again from 45 yards with 7:02 to play, and with 1:06 left, running back 
Barry Foster ran in from the two. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, there's no enthusiasm out there," Plummer said. "If 
you don't have enthusiasm, that's a reflection on how confident you feel going 
into the ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go out there with the attitude that you just have to show up, and 
things will take care of themselves. We're paid to win, not to play. I don't 
know if everyone has that attitude."

SAN DIEGO STATE: COACH STILL SEARCHING FOR IMPROVEMENT AFTER DEFENSE'S LATEST 
DEBACLE. HE'S HOPING HIS PLAYERS BENEFIT FROM WRITTEN EVALUATIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
After a record-setting performance at Wyoming Saturday, maybe the San Diego 
State defense should leave a few apples on Coach Al Luginbill's desk this week. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill has tried educating and coaching, motivating and cajoling. Now, after 
a 52-51 loss at Wyoming, he will hand out written grades and evaluations to the 
Aztec defense after each practice. 
</P>
<P>
You figure a victory should be guaranteed when you score 51 points, but not 
with this bunch. SDSU (2-3, 1-2 in the Western Athletic Conference) is now 
owner of the NCAA Division I record for most points scored in a loss -- not 
something you really want to brag about. The Aztecs eclipsed the efforts of New 
Mexico (1985) and Washington (1973), who scored 49 points each in losses. 
</P>
<P>
So Luginbill and his staff will prepare these written evaluations. The coaches 
always grade players after games but previously gave just given verbal 
evaluations during and after practices. Now, the defenders will be able to read 
about it all in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
"So the individual understands clearly the basics of what he's doing," 
Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
He knows it will take the coaching staff loads of extra time. And he knows they 
have enough else to do putting together game plans, planning practices, running 
practices, recruiting and everything else a coach does during the season. 
</P>
<P>
But when you have exhausted just about all other options, and your defense 
continues to exhibit a propensity to go into the tank faster and deeper than 
Shamu, what else are you going to do? 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming shredded the Aztecs for 648 yards. Quarterback Tom Corontzos had the 
best day of his career, passing for 421 yards, and Wyoming averaged 10 yards 
per play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys scored seven touchdowns, five in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably as shocked, or more shocked, than I ever have been in my 
coaching career at what happened in the last quarter-and-a-half," Luginbill 
said. "I've never, ever experienced anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Starting about midway through the third quarter and continuing the rest of the 
way, the SDSU defense moved up and down the field faster than the SDSU offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs hate when that happens. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we have an inability to make plays at crucial times," Luginbill 
said. "It is a disease in the program. It's cropped its head up too many times 
for us to say it will go away. It won't happen overnight, but if we whittle it 
down a little each week . . . " 
</P>
<P>
SDSU has plenty of work to do this week before Saturday's game at UCLA (2-3, 
2-1 in the Pacific 10). Per game, the Aztecs are allowing: 39 points, 333 yards 
passing, 508 total yards, seven yards per play. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in a few mistakes by SDSU's special teams, and it adds up to a slow 
start. 
</P>
<P>
It all should be enough to make the offense -- averaging 38 points and 495 
yards per game -- sick. 
</P>
<P>
"It is frustrating," quarterback Dan McGwire said after Saturday's game. 
"Special teams has had some hard times. The bottom line in these types of games 
is that the offense has to take it into our own hands. It's disheartening, but 
we've got to keep our heads up." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it's even enough to make opponents sick. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst game I've ever been in," Wyoming defensive end Mitch Donahue 
told the Rocky Mountain News. "I don't even feel like we won. I am 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs ran 88 offensive plays to Wyoming's 64 and held the ball for 35:04 
-- and still lost. In a 62-34 loss to Brigham Young three weeks ago, they did 
the same thing: ran more plays than BYU (101-62) and held the ball longer 
(38:48). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything makes less sense in the sport of football," Luginbill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So pack a lunch and move those desks into rows. It's back to school. 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget to bring an apple. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Luginbill said the Aztecs will redshirt freshman linebacker Jamal 
Duff. Duff -- SDSU's prize freshman recruit last winter -- suffered a deep 
thigh bruise in the season opener at Oregon and hasn't played since. . . . Free 
safety Johnny Walker sprained an ankle against Wyoming and is questionable for 
this week's game at UCLA. Running back Tommy Booker is expected back from his 
ankle sprain. . . . Any personnel changes expected on defense this week? "We 
haven't gotten that far yet," Luginbill said Sunday. "To be honest, we're 
forgetting this one (the Wyoming game). The worst thing you can do in my mind 
is go and jump the defense and move 9,000 guys around. I think everything would 
go up in flames." . . . Quarterback Dan McGwire now has attempted 133 
consecutive passes without an interception. For the season, he has thrown just 
one interception in 194 attempts. In the past three games, he has completed 78 
of 130 passes (60%) for 1,120 yards (373.3 per game) and 11 touchdowns. . . . 
Receiver Dennis Arey leads the nation in receiving yards per game at 115.20. He 
is sixth in the nation -- and fourth in the WAC -- with 6.2 receptions per 
game. . . . UCLA has scored in a record 221 consecutive games. The last time 
the Bruins were shut out was at Michigan in the third game of the 1971 season. 
. . . SDSU is 0-8 at the Rose Bowl against UCLA.

was a little more than a month ago that Eric Green picked up the morning 
newspaper and read that Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll told him it was a 
waste of everyone's time for him to even show up this season. 
</P>
<P>
Green, the No. 1 draft pick who held out of the entire camp during of contract 
negotiations, read that it was too late for him to help the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't going to do anyone any good by signing now. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember all that," Green said Sunday in the aftermath of the Steelers' 
36-14 victory over the Chargers. "I wonder what he's thinking now." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe Walton, the Steeler offensive coordinator: "I can tell you exactly 
what Chuck's thinking, because we both know that we have a very good player on 
our hands. Eric's got the ability to make big plays, as you saw today, and he's 
going to give teams a whole lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Green, who played in his first game a week ago after signing Sept. 10, had his 
first three receptions of the season, and two happened to be for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to enjoy this one as much as I can," said Green, only the fourth 
player to be drafted out of Liberty College. "This is everything I've always 
hoped it would be. I walked up to Burt Grossman (the Charger defensive lineman 
from Pitt) after the game and just said, 'Liberty, baby, Liberty.' 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me funny and just laughed, saying, 'Nice game.' "

the week. BOB NIGHTENGALE

STEELERS FINALLY ABLE TO MAKE THEIR POINTS

<P>
The fans at Three Rivers Stadium screamed in ecstasy. Players were hugging each 
other. A woman wearing a black-and-gold outfit was seen crying. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Steelers, at 1:37 p.m. local time, finally scored a touchdown 
with their offense, their first since Christmas Eve, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Historians will note that it was rookie tight end Eric Green who took the 
eight-yard pass from Bubby Brister with 14 minutes 2 seconds left in the second 
quarter. Green, realizing the historic value of all this, kept the football, 
running into the locker room after the game with it tucked under his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget this one," said Green, echoing the thoughts of the entire 
city. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Steelers had gone 279 days without an offensive touchdown. They 
had played 4 hours 31 minutes 3 seconds of game time without a touchdown. They 
had run 232 offensive plays this season without a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you what," said cornerback Rod Woodson, "if we hadn't scored today, the 
definition of bad would have been the Steelers. They would have had to make up 
new dictionaries so they could have a picture of the Steelers under "bad." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tunch Ilkin, offensive right tackle: "I'm really glad we scored, because 
now I can leave my house again. It was getting so bad that I couldn't even walk 
around town. I didn't want to keep answering questions about our offense." 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, suddenly feeling smug, then went out and did something crazy. 
They scored another touchdown. And another. And another. 
</P>
<P>
By the time game ended, and the crowd of 53,486 stood dazed in disbelief. The 
Steelers had scored four offensive touchdowns in a 36-14 victory over the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
It as the Steelers' biggest offensive bonanza since they scored 39 points on 
Oct. 23, 1988, against the Denver Broncos, and they celebrated by presenting 
the game ball to Joe Walton, the beleaguered offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say," he said, "but considering the way we've been 
struggling, I know I'll sleep a lot better tonight." 
</P>
<P>
It was a week ago at this time when the crowd at Three Rivers began chanting, 
"Joe Must Go." The talk shows were filled with fans rallying to donate money to 
send him on the next plane out. A local newspaper even ran a contest for 
readers to predict what week the Steelers would score their first offensive 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the Steelers' inept offense also provided plenty of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Do you know why Bubby Brister has been sleeping at Three Rivers 
Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: His front door is painted like an end zone, and he can't get in." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been so frustrating," Brister said, "I can't even begin to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the Steelers, who entered the game Sunday averaging eight 
points and 175.3 yards a game, is that they have yet to grasp Walton's new 
offensive system. It also hasn't helped, of course, that they aren't real eager 
to bother learning it. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps coming to the realization that they, not Walton, were embarrassing 
themselves on the field each Sunday, they had a players-only team meeting 
Tuesday. The kind, running back Tim Worley said, "when everyone takes a hard 
look at themselves." 
</P>
<P>
And just like that, the Steelers gain 376 yards, with 25 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we play like this every week," Brister said, "we can beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Can you play like this every week under the new offensive system? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to answer that one," Brister said. 
</P>
<P>
Brister still has difficulty adapting to the offensive scheme, even though it 
was greatly simplified against the Chargers. There was so much confusion after 
just the third play of the game that Brister had to call a timeout. And then 
they couldn't get a play off in time and were penalized for delay of game. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest obstacle, Brister maintains, is that Walton continues to use a 
shuttle system of players bringing the play to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time it gets to the third party, which is me," Brister said, "I'm not 
even sure it's the right play. It's like how rumors are started. By the time it 
gets around, its damned near a lie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we ran a play today, 'Two split right, tight Z, short motion, short 
sprint-left, 49 on 2.' 
</P>
<P>
"You try repeating that. I'm no brain surgeon. But I am the same quarterback I 
was last year, I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
It's quite likely the Steelers' woes won't quickly vanish considering their 
next two games: at Denver and at San Francisco.

RECESSION: AMERICAN FIRMS APPEAR MORE VULNERABLE THAN FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS TO A 
DOWNTURN. BUT SOME WOULD FEEL THE EFFECT MORE THAN OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the U.S. economy on the verge of slipping into its first downturn in eight 
years, there are growing fears that a recession could seriously damage the 
nation's ability to compete with its overseas rivals in high technology. 
</P>
<P>
A recession would work to the benefit of companies that have good positions in 
growing markets, plenty of cash and a willingness to play for the long term. 
Most Japanese companies -- as well as some European and Korean firms -- fit 
that description. Many American companies do not. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability to maintain investment in new technologies is likely to be much 
more seriously injured here than in Japan," said Stephen Cohen, co-director of 
the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. "There's a long record of 
the Japanese moving in during a recession." 
</P>
<P>
If an economic slump forces American companies to cut back, they could lose 
even more ground in key technologies such as computer chips, where major 
portions are now Japanese-controlled, in part because of gains the country made 
in earlier recessions. The United States' tenuous grip on world leadership in 
computer systems and telecommunications equipment could be further weakened, 
and small American technology firms that are often in the forefront of 
innovation might find it hard to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, recessions have been very damaging to American technological 
competitiveness as U.S. firms have eliminated or drastically cut research and 
development programs," said Robert M. White, undersecretary of Commerce for 
technology. "Our international competitors have a much longer-range outlook and 
have accordingly maintained their level of investment in times of business 
downturns." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of a slump in the electronics business are appearing. Growth in many 
segments of the business has almost ground to a halt, and there's no product on 
the horizon that's poised to ride to the rescue, as the personal computer did 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
And for a number of reasons, Japanese electronics companies in general are well 
positioned to forge ahead even in bad times. They are larger than all but a few 
of their U.S. counterparts, face less pressure from shareholders for short-term 
profits and are not burdened by the debt that hobbles many American companies. 
Their critics say they also benefit from a protected home market and 
government-led strategies for selling abroad that often involve illegal 
"dumping" of products at below-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese will have some problems of their own, but they have more staying 
power and more resilience than we do," says Charles Ferguson, a research 
associate with the Center for Technology Policy and Industrial Development at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Ominously, it was during and after the 1981-82 recession that Japanese 
companies became the leaders in worldwide production of semiconductor chips, 
the tiny but highly complex units that control computers. The ability to 
compete in semiconductors -- which Americans invented -- is considered a 
bellwether of technological competitiveness, and it requires huge investments 
in research and development and production equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, U.S. firms had 57% of the world semiconductor market, versus 33% for 
the Japanese. Michael Borrus, deputy director of the Berkeley Roundtable, 
calculates that although spending by U.S. semiconductor companies on 
chip-making gear did not grow between 1981 and 1983, Japanese firms nearly 
doubled their investments, to $1.45 billion by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
By 1983, Japan surpassed the United States in total absolute investment in 
semiconductor technology. Japanese firms continued to spend more through a 1985 
slump in semiconductor demand, during which they were formally accused by the 
U.S. government of dumping chips in the American market. By 1986, the Japanese 
had taken over the lead in worldwide semiconductor sales. Today, Japanese 
companies dominate many portions of the business, including the critical 
memory-chip sector. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of industries, failure to invest through a recession has been a 
turning point," Borrus says. A recession now, he warns, "could turn out to be a 
very significant episode." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, says a 
recession will also hit U.S. industry in an area where it has traditionally 
been very strong: the nurturing of small companies that are developing 
innovative technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"Recessions are risky times, and capital stops flowing to the riskier 
companies," Murphy said. He added that some successful small companies are 
already short of money because current market conditions make it difficult to 
sell stock. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said depressed stock prices and a general lack of investment funds in the 
United States would lead to "a continuation of Japanese acquisitions of small 
technology companies. Over 100 have already been bought." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts caution that the ultimate impact of a recession on the balance of 
power in technology will depend on many factors, not the least of which is 
whether the recession is worldwide. If the Japanese economy -- heavily 
dependent on Middle East oil -- were to weaken dramatically, Japanese firms 
would be less able to exploit opportunities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many U.S. computer firms now gain more than half their sales overseas 
and more than one-third in Europe. If Europe avoids a recession, that could 
help the U.S. electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Exchange rates are also a critical factor in regulating the electronics trade, 
and the dollar has been falling fast in recent months. Claude Barfield, trade 
policy specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think 
tank, noted that a weak dollar works to the advantage of U.S. manufacturers by 
making their exports cheap and discouraging imports. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a recession gives the Japanese any more opportunities," Barfield 
said. "The Japanese economy is going into a difficult period, and if the U.S. 
is in a recession, that hurts the Japanese companies as well." 
</P>
<P>
John Mitchell, vice chairman of Motorola, also said there was no correlation 
between recession and competitiveness. "There is no fundamental reason (the 
Japanese) should be better off," he said. Motorola has played a key role in 
maintaining U.S. competence in semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
And some industry executives are not at all persuaded that a recession is 
imminent. They suggest that the eagerness of corporate customers to move from 
huge centralized computer systems to networks of desktop computers will keep 
demand strong. 
</P>
<P>
"What recession?" asks Scott McNealy, president of Sun Microsystems, a vendor 
of high-powered desktop computers known as workstations. "To me, a recession is 
when bookings are down. We look at the Sun economy, not the national economy." 
</P>
<P>
But industry sales trends are not encouraging. The Gartner Group, a Stamford, 
Conn.-based research firm, recently reported that total information-industry 
sales grew by just 6.6% in 1989, an all-time low and less than half the 1988 
growth rate of 16.5%. For the second quarter ended June 30, 1990, growth 
slipped to 6%, down from 7.7% in the first quarter, according to Gartner Group. 
</P>
<P>
"This recession is going to hurt," says Murphy. "Personal computer sales are 
slowing, without anything to replace them, and the defense business is going 
away. The only parts of the business that will do well are those that are in 
their own new-product cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, few U.S. industry executives seem concerned about the possible 
impact of a recession on American competitiveness. And that could make the 
ultimate result even worse. 
</P>
<P>
"If they think a recession is going to leave them untouched, they're living in 
a fantasy world," said Kenneth Flamm, a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution, a Washington think tank. "If the market weeds out the smaller 
players, it's mostly U.S. firms that will be weeded out."

ALLIED-SIGNAL HOLDS DELIVERIES, FEARING FAKED VENDOR TESTS 
</P>

Allied-Signal Aerospace was forced to stop shipments of control systems for 
commercial and military aircraft after it discovered discrepancies in test 
reports submitted by a parts supplier two weeks ago, company officials 
disclosed. The firm has since resumed some but not all shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents, meanwhile, are conducting an investigation into allegations 
that Supreme Steel Treating, an El Monte-based heat treating shop, provided 
false certifications indicating that it had conducted inspection tests on the 
Allied-Signal parts, according to a government source and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Steel owners Neal Begerow and Bobby Abert could not be reached, and a 
company office manager said the firm was declining to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being conducted by the Defense Criminal Investigative 
Service, a Pentagon agency that specializes in defense fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
Allied-Signal's AiResearch Los Angeles division, based in Torrance, uncovered 
the discrepancies in the test reports during a routine audit of vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors found that certification documents for heat-treated parts submitted 
since the beginning of 1989 were actually photocopies of earlier certification 
documents but with dates altered, said the AiResearch division president, John 
Boppert. 
</P>
<P>
After making the discovery, AiResearch officials notified Defense Department 
officials and its major commercial customers. The firm is the world's leading 
supplier of aircraft pressurization and heating and cooling equipment. It also 
makes actuators, the devices that operate control surfaces on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every U.S. aircraft, including those produced by McDonnell Douglas, 
Boeing, Northrop and Lockheed, and most foreign aircraft contain the firm's 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that happened here are an example of how the system ought to work," 
Boppert said, referring to AiResearch's discovery of the discrepancies during a 
routine audit and its effort to locate the suspect parts. "Our part of the 
industry is more meticulous than is generally known by the public." 
</P>
<P>
Falsification of tests, nonetheless, is a growing problem in the aerospace 
industry. Dozens of federal felony cases have been brought across the country 
for falsification of tests of castings, forgings, electronic parts, welds and a 
variety of other products, Pentagon officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are mounting in Congress to reform the system by either creating a 
requirement for independent testing of aircraft parts or at least establishing 
national standards for the training of inspectors who conduct the tests. 
Meanwhile, prime contractors such as Boeing are increasing their surveillance 
of parts vendors and have created special internal investigative units to cope 
with fraud problems. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Steel, a small heat-treating operation that employs about two dozen 
workers, was on AiResearch's approved vendor list. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited 
the firm for a series of employee safety hazards and imposed penalties of 
$12,700. Among other citations, the firm failed to train employees in the 
handling of toxic chemicals, OSHA alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Boppert said the cost to AiResearch of the delay in shipments, retesting of 
suspect parts and man-hours devoted to locating parts will be in the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars. Boppert estimated that the cost of properly conducting 
the tests on the heat-treated parts would have amounted to a small percentage 
of total costs. 
</P>
<P>
AiResearch was able to resume making shipments after it determined that the 
suspect parts were not used in all its products, Boppert said. 
</P>
<P>
AiResearch is still attempting to determine which categories of parts may have 
been treated at Supreme Steel, a difficult task since AiResearch carries 
inventories of more than 40,000 types of parts, Boppert said. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Steel was not a direct subcontractor to AiResearch, but provided 
heat-treating service to parts manufacturers under subcontract to AiResearch, 
Boppert said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 26, after auditors discovered the discrepancies in the test records, 
the firm notified its computer programming staff to stay through the night and 
develop special computer programs that would scan company records for types of 
parts that would require heat treating, Boppert said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, calls were placed to hundreds of supplier firms, asking them 
to determine whether they had hired Supreme Steel for heat-treating services, 
Boppert said. 
</P>
<P>
After several days, AiResearch narrowed the list of suspect parts to about 300 
and began searching its warehouses for those parts for retesting. By this week, 
the firm hopes to pare the list of suspect part types to 20, which in some 
cases will have to be retrieved from aircraft in current operation. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect parts are not known to have caused safety problems and their 
failure would be unlikely to cause a serious incident, Boppert said. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, however, the parts in question were found to have not been 
heat-treated properly. In other cases, the parts appeared to have been 
heat-treated to some extent, but simply lacked proper certification. 
</P>
<P>
Heat treating is a process in which a metal part is heated and then cooled at a 
controlled rate, either slowly or very quickly by quenching it. The process 
increases the strength of the metal, but also makes it more brittle. Thus, heat 
treating must have the correct balance between strength and hardness.

BANKS PULL OUT, BUT UNIONS VOW A NEW UAL BID; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE OFFER IS LIKELY TO BE MUCH LOWER THAN THE $201 A SHARE THAT THE 
COMPANY'S BOARD APPROVED IN APRIL. IT MAY SET UP A UNION-BOARD SHOWDOWN.

United Airlines' unions said Sunday that they will make a new offer for parent 
UAL Corp. on Tuesday that does not involve bank loans, following the withdrawal 
from the buyout of four major banks, including Los Angeles-based Security 
Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer would be financed without bank loans because it would use less 
cash. Gerald Greenwald, chairman of the United Employee Acquisition Corp., said 
shareholders would receive cash and a package of three securities worth in 
excess of $150 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said the new offer had the support of UAL's largest shareholder, the 
Coniston Partners investment firm. It wasn't clear, however, that UAL's board 
would approve it. 
</P>
<P>
The unions -- including pilots, mechanics and flight attendants -- expect to 
finance the new offer with money contributed by aircraft manufacturers, the 
pilots' retirement account and UAL's own treasury. They would also get money 
from the sale-leaseback of aircraft -- under which a company sells airplanes 
and leases them back. Greenwald declined to say how much money was involved. 
</P>
<P>
The new offer sets the stage for a showdown at UAL's board meeting Tuesday. The 
proposed offer will almost certainly be worth less than the $201-a-share union 
offer that was accepted by the UAL board in April. At the time, the board 
indicated that it would not accept a lower bid. 
</P>
<P>
The board does not face an easy decision. The unions have already said they 
would strike, if necessary, to obtain wage increases if their buyout fails. The 
pilot union further signaled its dissatisfaction Sunday when it rejected a 
company proposal regarding payment for special military flights to the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the board could open itself up to shareholder attack if it 
accepts a bid that is much lower than the $201-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the union offer, the board is expected to receive a counterproposal 
from UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf that calls for distributing cash to 
shareholders from funds raised through the sale-leaseback of aircraft. Such a 
move could satisfy UAL shareholders, many of whom have lost millions on the 
stock since the first $300-a-share offer collapsed last October. 
</P>
<P>
A recapitalization wouldn't do much for labor relations at United, and might 
actually hurt, because the unions could argue that shareholders were getting 
money that belongs in their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald would not speculate on how UAL directors would view the union offer. 
"I am just going to concentrate on making a strong offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said the unions decided not to team up with Los Angeles billionaire 
Marvin Davis on the new bid because they wanted majority ownership. Davis last 
week proposed to buy the company with the unions under a plan that would give 
the unions a 20% stake and the option to buy the rest in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The unions said any hope of financing the $201-a-share offer was dashed after 
fuel prices soared in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The doubling of oil prices since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the 
extraordinarily tight credit market conditions which have existed since then 
have made it impossible to syndicate the proposed bank loan," the employee 
group said in a statement released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said on Sunday that continued economic uncertainty caused the banks 
to turn their backs on an even lower offer of $175 to $180 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that it wasn't a good transaction," he said. "They (the banks) were 
just scared." 
</P>
<P>
Five banks were prepared to lend $1.75 billion but couldn't come up with the 
remaining $250 million that was required and could not find other banks to 
participate in the financing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Security Pacific, the other banks that withdrew include Manufacturers 
Hanover, Bankers Trust and First Chicago. A Dutch bank, NMB Postbank Groep 
N.V., had also agreed to join the lead-bank group. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said the new offer would include notes, preferred stock and a 
certificate that appreciates in value as UAL's earnings rise. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwald said participation from aircraft manufacturers would come when UAL 
placed an order for widebody aircraft. He said no decision has been made on 
whether to buy aircraft from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas or Airbus Industrie.

Gas Prices Rise 6 Cents Per Gallon: Pump prices rose an average of 6 cents a 
gallon in the past two weeks to $1.44.20, including taxes, according to the 
Lundberg Survey taken Friday at 13,500 stations nationwide. At self-serve 
pumps, the average price of regular leaded gasoline, including taxes, was 
$1.30.59 per gallon; for unleaded, $1.33.56 per gallon; and for premium 
unleaded, $1.49.95 per gallon. Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 
the average price of gasoline has climbed 26 1/2 cents a gallon.

AUTO WORKERS, FORD AGREE ON TENTATIVE PACT 
</P>

<P>
Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers reached a tentative contract Sunday 
that is similar to an agreement that General Motors Corp. forged with the union 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Once Ford workers ratify the contract, a process expected to be completed Oct. 
21, the union will head to Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The most contentious issue in the Ford-UAW talks was a provision calling for 
penalties of up to $5 an hour for scheduling excessive overtime. Ford makes 
more liberal use of overtime than does GM or Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
The overtime penalty, which increases as the number of scheduled overtime hours 
increases, doesn't appear to be a problem in the near future since car and 
truck sales are down and any economic recovery doesn't seem to be close at 
hand, Ford Chairman Harold Poling said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the overtime premium, the agreement provides for income 
guarantees for laid-off workers. GM has promised to spend up to $4 billion to 
compensate idled workers. At Ford, with a much smaller work force, the 
commitment would be around $1.5 billion, UAW President Owen Bieber said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract covers about 100,000 Ford employees. GM has about 300,000 UAW 
workers and Chrysler Corp. about 63,000. 
</P>
<P>
At Chrysler, the union and the company are at loggerheads over whether the 
financially struggling firm will be allowed to deviate greatly from the pattern 
agreement. Company officials insist that Chrysler needs relief from soaring 
health-care costs.

Mobil CEO to Testify in Civil Suit: Allen E. Murray has been ordered to testify 
this week in a lawsuit by former Mobil Oil Corp. environmental officer Valcar 
Bowman, who says he was fired for refusing to help cover up environmental 
problems at its Bakersfield plant after the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office raided the company's Torrance facility. Murray is expected to 
be questioned about an order to transfer documents from the Bakersfield plant 
to the company's outside counsel and about his response to a memo that Bowman 
sent about company environmental practices.

GEFFEN, OTHERS MAY FACE BIG TAXES IF MCA SOLD; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE AMERICAN FIRM WANT A MATSUSHITA BUYOUT 
DEAL THAT WOULD MINIMIZE WHAT THEY OWE UNCLE SAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Music mogul David Geffen, who rejected an all-cash bid for his company and sold 
it at a lower price to MCA Inc. in March in a deal that enabled him to avoid a 
huge tax bill, may have a tough time avoiding taxes if Matsushita Industrial 
Electric Co. consummates an offer for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen's predicament -- and that of other large MCA shareholders -- has touched 
off an intriguing debate among accountants and investment bankers about how a 
Matsushita buyout of MCA might be structured to avoid an immediate tax burden 
on large MCA shareholders, some of whom might realize profits of hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
MCA -- whose holdings include Universal Studios, record companies, a film 
library, theme parks and a New York-area TV station -- saw its stock fall 75 
cents a share Thursday and another $1.75 the next day to close the week at $61 
a share. This was after a spokesman for Japan's largest consumer electronics 
company said Matsushita officials hadn't begun talks with MCA but will travel 
to the United States to begin them soon. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say sparing MCA shareholders the prospects of immediately paying taxes 
on any stock profit would be complicated by Matsushita's status: As a foreign 
company whose shares do not trade directly in the United States, it cannot 
easily issue its stock to MCA shareholders as a way of avoiding an immediately 
taxable transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear that you could get a tax-free transaction with Matsushita," 
said Ilan Kaufthal, managing director of the New York investment banking firm 
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. He said he didn't know of an instance of a major 
foreign company attempting such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with speculation that Matsushita might offer as much as $90 a share 
for MCA, only weeks after the stock was trading around $35, some shareholders 
say they aren't worried about having to give as much as one-third of their 
profits to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the cash" from Matsushita, said GRP Records President Larry Rosen, 
who received 759,140 shares of MCA stock when he sold his record company to the 
entertainment giant in February. 
</P>
<P>
Investors in a company being purchased by another firm sometime prefer stock in 
lieu of cash to avoid paying taxes immediately on profits from the sale. Taking 
stock gives investors the flexibility to realize a capital gain later, when 
they are in a lower tax bracket or have losses to offset profits. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen said tax considerations were the main reason that he spurned a 
$700-million cash offer from the British media conglomerate Thorn EMI and sold 
his Geffen Record company in March for MCA stock then worth about $545 million. 
Geffen had called MCA stock "undervalued" when it rose $3 a share a few weeks 
after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Geffen, who estimates MCA's breakup value at more than $100 a 
share, has said that he will "support any decision" that MCA officials make 
regarding a sale of the company and that he has no intentions of independently 
selling his MCA stock. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in his peculiar position as holder of a specially issued MCA stock, Geffen 
is said to be extremely concerned about the impact an agreement might have on 
his ability to cash out at maximum value to the Japanese giant Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be a billionaire," one MCA source said. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen holds 621,684 shares of MCA common stock and an additional 921,914 
shares of MCA participating convertible preferred stock, which he received when 
he sold his record company to the entertainment giant. Each of Geffen's 
preferred shares can be converted into 10 shares of MCA common stock. At 
Friday's closing price, Geffen's holdings would be worth about $598 million. 
But under a four-year agreement with MCA, Geffen cannot sell his stock at one 
time or to a single buyer unless MCA is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the price paid for MCA, however, Geffen may not be better off 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
Factoring in the taxes that would become due in any cash purchase of MCA, 
Kaufthal of the Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. investment firm calculates that MCA 
would have to be sold for at least $71 a share for Geffen to improve on the 
paper profit he realized in March when he sold his company to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Holthouse, a partner at the Los Angeles accounting firm Parks, Palmer, 
Turner &amp; Yemenidjian, said one way to achieve a tax-free transaction might 
be for Matsushita to acquire MCA using its American depositary receipts -- 
which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. ADRs are special securities 
that allow American investors to purchase equity in a foreign company whose 
stock does not trade on U.S. exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1965 decision, the IRS held that "a holder of an American depositary 
receipt will be treated . . . as if he held the underlying shares of (the 
company's) stock directly" for purposes of claiming a foreign tax credit and 
certain other benefits. And two years ago, in a private letter ruling, the IRS 
indicated that the transfer of a foreign company's stock for the assets of a 
U.S. corporation may not result in an immediately taxable gain. 
</P>
<P>
Holthouse believes that the IRS rulings "mean you probably could do a tax-free 
reorganization using those (ADRs), if it's structured correctly." 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently both (MCA Chairman Lew R.) Wasserman and Geffen will have a pretty 
low basis in their stock so they would have a tremendous" tax obligation. (The 
tax basis of an investment is, effectively, its purchase price.) 
</P>
<P>
"But if it ends up being a taxable purchase," Holthouse said, "it will 
certainly help solve the federal budget deficit."

In 1978, the Glendale native pitched the Mormon faith in Japan, learning that 
nation's language and culture through door-to-door encounters in southern 
Honshu and on Shikoku island. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he joined the Tokyo office of advertising giant Ogilvy &amp; Mather 
and persuaded the Japanese to eat more Sunkist oranges, use more Exxon oil and 
wear Lee jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Then he began pitching the American viewpoint to the Japanese, gaining status 
as a celebrity gaijin, or foreigner. He made more than 300 TV appearances, 
during which he was interviewed on questions ranging from East-West relations 
to "Do you like Japanese women?" He even became a regular panelist on a TV quiz 
show, "Those Amazing Foreigners: They Get It Right Every Time!" 
</P>
<P>
Now Goddard is back in Southern California, this time selling the merits of 
what he calls the future of transpacific marketing: video brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard, 31, is president of the Video Agency in Hollywood. It produces, 
distributes and markets videos in 40 languages that are used to sell products, 
project corporate images and attract overseas investors. Goddard says video 
marketing combines the best of three media: It has the visual appeal of 
television. It can target consumers as precisely as direct mail. And it can 
convey the details of print brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Video brochures also save the cost and time of sales trips, overcome language 
barriers and allow the potential buyer to see the product directly, Goddard 
says. A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of 
Business found that video brochures increase information retention by 50% and 
speed up buying decisions by 72%. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of advertising isn't broadcasting with traditional mediums," says 
Goddard, a natural pitchman who punctuates his speech with excited waves of his 
arms. The future, he said, is target marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Douglas and Coldwell Banker are using Goddard's videos to sell 
million-dollar properties to wealthy Japanese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong 
residents. Baskin-Robbins is using them to find joint-venture partners for its 
31 flavors in Indonesia and South Korea. Sony has used them to make video 
magazines about its products. For such large companies, Goddard's agency can 
make elaborate videos whose costs run into the six figures. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency can also produce videos for as low as $5,000 for small 
businesses. When Newport Beach couple Steve and Barbara Kent wanted to 
franchise their baked potato business, Posh Potato, they went to Goddard. He 
produced a video about their business for less than $10,000 and introduced them 
to a potential joint-venture partner in Japan. The couple took their video to 
Japan -- and came back with a deal and a $650,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Richardson, vice president of a San Clemente auto-painting business, said 
the 25-minute video produced by the Video Agency has helped sell 89 franchises 
in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. His firm, Color Nouveau, 
made back its $8,000 investment in the video in one month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
First the video depicts the problem: runaway shopping carts nicking cars, 
careless passengers throwing open their door and dinging the sides of parked 
cars. Then it shows how Color Nouveau's paint restoration system can eliminate 
the scratches more quickly and cheaply than typical body repair shops. Although 
brochures are also sent to prospective customers, Richardson said not one sale 
has closed without the video aid. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'OK, here's a brochure, and I'm already bored with reading.' But the 
video takes them in, captures their interest, creates a desire, convinces them. 
And they call. And boom. The final sales close," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Video Agency also helps develop a firm's overall ad campaign. When Morinaga 
Nutritional Foods Inc. wanted to break into the U.S. tofu market a few years 
ago, it faced a formidable problem. Surveys indicated that Americans regarded 
tofu as a strange cultural product that ranked with lima beans, liver and 
Brussels sprouts as one of their least-liked foods. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard's firm developed a 30-minute cooking video showing how tofu could be 
used in such familiar recipes as strawberry cheesecake and lasagna. The agency 
also produced two cable-TV shows on the health merits of tofu and a five-minute 
sales video for buyers. The videos were part of Morinaga's ad campaign, "Tofu 
Magic," that included a cookbook by Julia Weinberg, a free sample and an 800 
telephone number for questions. 
</P>
<P>
After the campaign was launched, sales increased 130% in 1988 and have 
continued to grow about 30% since, said Morinaga's marketing consultant, Tom 
McReynolds. He said Goddard's work, as well as the other ad promotions, helped 
reposition tofu as a versatile, healthful ingredient for such mainstream 
recipes as pies. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has met smashing success. Carl's Jr. ordered a video to help it 
break into the Japanese market. But its Japanese partners said it was not 
adequately translated and they would have preferred a few different words and 
concepts, said Steve Kishi, vice president -- international. In hindsight, he 
said, the video should have been jointly developed by the U.S. and Japanese 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did not do properly was have our Japanese people listen to it first," 
Kishi said. "As far as promoting business, anything visual is good but, in our 
own experience, (the video) wasn't a home run." 
</P>
<P>
Kishi said the U.S. side sent half a dozen videos to Japan, and no more have 
been requested. To promote business in the future, Kishi plans to use more 
sales presentations instead. "In Japan, especially, it does mean a lot when you 
do it yourself. When you're talking face to face and eye to eye, it shows how 
much commitment you have." 
</P>
<P>
To develop a video, Goddard works with a client to come up with an overall 
theme. For production, he relies on a vast network of writers, directors and 
camera people, as well as distributors. Their names are plucked from several 
giant-sized Rolodex files in his black, high-tech office on Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
All production is done under contract with Advanced Teleproduction Services in 
Hollywood. The $20-million studio, frequented by the likes of Ron Howard and 
Steven Spielberg, boasts state-of-the-art equipment such as the "waveFront" 
animation that made the Batmobile's computer-graphic shields look real in the 
"Batman" film. 
</P>
<P>
Such sophisticated production, as well as the professional editing, 
distinguishes Goddard's work from other marketing videos, said Maureen 
McConnell, manager of international marketing for Baskin-Robbins International 
Co. Goddard developed videos introducing Baskin-Robbins to potential overseas 
partners. The ice cream company, which operates in 44 countries, sends out 
brochures for casual requests for information but uses videos for serious 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"Videos bring everything to the moment . . . a much more exciting presentation 
than brochures," McConnell said. "The bad news is that you have to have a TV 
set to plug it in." 
</P>
<P>
Goddard combines his knowledge of Japan with a family background in film. His 
father, John, is a producer of adventure films and documentaries. His mother 
and sister are actresses. Goddard and his Japanese wife, Kaoru, have two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
From the time Goddard started his business out of his Van Nuys home in 1987, 
the Video Agency has grown from grossing a few thousand dollars a year to $5 
million. Goddard used to make three videos a month but now handles 37, 
including promotions for a computerized wallet and how-to videos for home 
improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
And although he initially focused on soliciting business from Japanese firms, 
he is shifting his focus to try to help U.S. firms sell in Japan and other 
Pacific Rim markets. A new project is a video trade magazine, which will offer 
U.S. products in overseas markets.

THE PLAYERS: HOW THEY MIGHT FARE IN A DOWNTURN 
</P>

<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impact of an economic slump on the electronics industry will be very 
uneven, analysts say, with some sectors and companies continuing to prosper 
while others suffer severely. 
</P>
<P>
Vulnerable companies include the mostly American firms that sell minicomputers, 
large machines that are being squeezed between powerful desktop systems on the 
low end and high-performance mainframes and supercomputers on the high end. Not 
only have Data General, Wang Laboratories and Prime Computer been suffering 
large losses, but even Digital Equipment is encountering serious problems after 
years of rapid growth and big profits. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, by contrast, should be able to avoid the 
worst, despite its traditional reliance on large computers. The firm will get a 
boost next year from its new generation of mainframe computers and has been 
rapidly increasing its revenue from software. And because it is present in 
virtually all sectors of the business, including personal computers, it is not 
too vulnerable to weakness in one area. 
</P>
<P>
* In personal computers, growth in the $25-billion U.S. market has slowed to 
5%, according to many analysts, down from just over 10% last year. IBM and 
Compaq Computer have profited from the transition to more powerful machines 
based on the latest microprocessors from Intel, and Compaq's strong market 
position and management should allow it to cope well with a downturn, although 
its rapid growth may slow. 
</P>
<P>
The future of Apple Computer, which will unveil three low-priced versions of 
its Macintosh next week, is a subject of debate. Bob Puette, president of 
Apple's U.S. operations, believes that there will be an economic slump but that 
Apple can benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a great period to gain market share," he said. "We have a 
stream of great new products coming, and when you have that in a soft market, 
you can gain market share." He noted that Apple had been able to manage the 
drop from 50% annual growth in the mid-1980s to 10% growth last year, while 
maintaining its profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think Apple is in a weak position, but they have created their own 
product cycle," said Stewart Alsop, publisher of the PC Letter. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Ferguson, a research associate at MIT and technology adviser to the 
Boston investment bank Tucker Anthony, contends that the Macintosh product line 
has been pushed about as far as it can go, and that it will be severely hurt by 
Microsoft's Windows, a software program that gives IBM-compatible PCs many of 
the graphics features that made the Macintosh popular. And a recession is not 
necessarily the best time to shift to a low-price, high-volume sales strategy, 
as Apple is doing. 
</P>
<P>
* Whatever its effect on Apple, Windows should help Redmond, Wash.-based 
Microsoft glide through a recession. In general, analysts expect software, 
which is necessary to get the most out of equipment that has already been 
purchased, to fare better than hardware during an economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
For similar reasons, vendors of local-area networks such as Novell Inc. should 
do well. Networks linking computers within an office help customers get better 
productivity from computer investments, and the market for such systems is 
growing 30% annually. 
</P>
<P>
In personal computers, software and networking, Japanese firms are not nearly 
as strong vis-a-vis their U.S. rivals as they are in semiconductors. But they 
have a very strong position in small portable computers -- the fastest-growing 
piece of the business -- and they supply important parts such as screens, disk 
drives and power supplies for PCs made by American firms. Ferguson and others 
believe that they will use these strengths as a wedge to enter the PC 
mainstream at the first opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
* In the notoriously volatile chip business, Intel and Motorola are clearly the 
best-positioned of the U.S. firms. Intel has established its x86 line of 
microprocessors as the standard for PCs and cannot keep up with demand for its 
hot-selling 386 and 486 chips. 
</P>
<P>
Intel will spend $600 million this year -- and more next year -- on new capital 
equipment, and Executive Vice President Craig R. Barret said the general 
economic outlook would not affect its capital spending budget. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, with a similarly strong position in microprocessors and a large 
communications equipment business, is also in good shape. Smaller chip 
companies that concentrate on small markets -- and chip-design firms that 
contract out their manufacturing -- should be able to avoid the worst, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
But several large, old-line semiconductor companies, including National 
Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices, could be in deep trouble. Charles 
Sporck, president of National Semi, said his company had cut its capital 
spending plans for this fiscal year by 40% as a result of the weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies that have heavy fixed overhead are going to be under pressure," said 
Mel Phelps, semiconductor analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But Japanese semiconductor giants such as NEC, Toshiba, Fujitsu and Hitachi, 
which make a broad range of electronics and thus are their own best customers 
for chips, should be better positioned to ride out the storm.

Garagiola Returns: After five weeks off for elective surgery and recuperation, 
Joe Garagiola is scheduled to return this morning to NBC's "Today" show and on 
Tuesday report on the baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Garagiola, 64, has declined to say what kind of surgery was performed. A former 
"Today" co-anchor, he returned to the show last June on a three-day-a-week 
basis as part of NBC's effort to revive the show's ratings. The once-dominant 
program suffered a ratings slump after the replacement in January of Jane 
Pauley by Deborah Norville. CLAUDIA PUIG

SOME WINNERS, SOME LOSERS IN RADIO RATINGS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arbitron ratings released last week for the summer quarter brought local 
radio stations the usual grab bag of good news and bad news, glaring signs and 
mixed signals. There were few bombshells, but the ratings provided plenty of 
fodder for industry professionals to seriously discuss over their morning 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Popular topics of conversation included: 
</P>
<P>
* The KFMB-FM (B100) morning team of Jeff Elliott and Jerry St. James may not 
have come up with an original routine since David Letterman went on the air -- 
and they certainly don't make anybody laugh as much as they make themselves 
laugh -- but they are undoubtedly dominating morning radio. Backed by a series 
of television commercials, "Jeff and Jer" posted a 9.5 rating share among 
listeners 12 and over and an impressive 11.8 share in the key 25-54 age group. 
</P>
<P>
The book also makes it clear that Mike Berger and Jeff Prescott, who made a 
much trumpeted "defection" from KGB-FM (101.5) to XTRA-FM (91X) last year, are 
having little impact at their new station. Berger and Prescott posted a 3.9 
share, ranking them eighth in the 12-plus category. 
</P>
<P>
The much ballyhooed husband-wife team of Ron Stevens and Joy Grdnic has had 
similar uninspiring results at KKYY-FM (Y95). The duo was unable to muster 
anything better than a 3.0 share in the 25-54 category. 
</P>
<P>
* Overall, KKLQ (Q106) continued its remarkable string of ratings victories 
with its incessantly perky Top 40 dance music. In a business where consistency 
is a rarity, Q106 won the 12-plus category for the 12th consecutive rating 
period with a 9.1 share. 
</P>
<P>
However, XHTZ-FM (Z90), which switched its format last year with an eye toward 
competing against Q106, showed signs that it is moving toward the realm of 
respectability with a 2.9 share in the 12-plus category, up from a 1.9 in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
B100 had a strong book overall, placing second in 12-plus category with a 6.6 
share, and first among listeners age 25-54 with an 8.5 share. 
</P>
<P>
The country format of KSON, simulcast on AM (1240) and FM (97.3), is clearly 
more than a ratings fluke. Although it slipped slightly from its strong spring 
showing, KSON still placed third in the 12-plus category with a 6.5 share, and 
second in age 25-54 with an 8.4. It will be interesting to see whether KSON can 
maintain its momentum now that morning personality Jack Diamond has left. 
</P>
<P>
* A year ago, KJQY-FM (Sunny 103) "repositioned" its music programming to 
directly compete against KYXY-FM (96.5) for the "easy listening" audience. The 
summer book shows KJQY making steady improvement, increasing from a 4.4 in the 
spring to a 5.2 rating share among listeners 12 and over, while KYXY slipped 
from a 3.7 to a 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 15 round fight and I've been in a whole lot of 15 round fights," said 
KYXY General Manager Jim Price. "They won round one, but I've always been 
standing there in the 15th." 
</P>
<P>
Sunny 103 was heavily promoted on television during the ratings period. KYXY 
has counterattacked with its own television ad campaign, which didn't begin 
until the end of the ratings period. 
</P>
<P>
* For the second consecutive summer, KGB-FM (101.5) took a ratings dive. KGB's 
album-oriented rock managed only a 4.9 among listeners 12 and over, down from a 
7.1 in the spring. KGB's main competition, 91X and KSDO-FM (Classic 103), 
didn't make large gains, so it's not like another station is stealing KGB's 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why it happens in the summer," program director Ted Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards emphasized that the Birch survey, which uses different methodology than 
Arbitron, showed KGB in second, behind Q106. But there is little doubt that 
once-powerful KGB has lost something of its ratings supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, KGB has been reacting to the new competition of Classic 103 
by "reemphasizing" classic rock 'n' roll. Speculation in the industry suggests 
that the emphasis on classic rock may have hurt KGB's overall ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"If that were true, then the Birch (rating) would have fallen too," Edwards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Television is an inexact medium. Words and phrases flippantly tossed about as 
part of the conversational approach can be extremely damaging. Last week 
Charger linebacker Billy Ray Smith confronted Channel 10 sports guy Larry 
Sacknoff during a weekly on-air segment over the use of one word. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was upset that Sacknoff refered to Charger lineman Joe Phillip's 
companion the night he was attacked as his "girlfriend." Smith demanded an 
apology. Sacknoff refused. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the titillating aspects of the argument -- oh, my, how will this affect 
Sacknoff's relationship with Smith's wife, Channel 10 co-anchor Kimberly Hunt? 
-- there is the very real issue of Channel 10 labeling the married Phillips as 
a philanderer. 
</P>
<P>
Sacknoff says the term "girlfriend" was used in the copy given him, which is 
the proverbial passing of the buck. He and Channel 10 executives say they stick 
to the accuracy of the word, but they changed to "female companion" in later 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly didn't set out to hurt Joe Phillips or his wife," Sacknoff said. 
"Our sources said she was a girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he is paid to appear on Channel 10 on a weekly basis, Smith was 
certainly justified in complaining, since he is paid to represent the Chargers' 
viewpoint. It's too bad Sacknoff was not better prepared to answer his charges 
and to discuss the very real issues involved. Television doesn't have the same 
mechanism to correct errors as newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we made a mistake, and I told this to Larry, it was that we didn't 
attribute (the term girlfriend) to sources," news director Paul Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old monthly San Diego Executive magazine is out with a new design 
and expanded form, the result of a $500,000 influx of capital from Alfred 
Gooding, the industrialist brother of editor Margaret Gooding. 
</P>
<P>
The mag claims a "controlled circulation" of 23,000, which basically means the 
magazine is free, but only to the right type of reader -- in this case 
"business owners who make more than $300,000 in annual sales," according to 
publisher Mary Ann Czerwinski. 
</P>
<P>
The new and improved magazine also includes a new "editorial advisory board," 
which includes such San Diego business promoters as Dan Pegg of the San Diego 
Economic Development Corp. and Dal Watkins of the Convention &amp; Visitor's 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Though some may look at the new board and wonder if the magazine is going to 
become a cheerleader for the local business community, Czerwinski said the 
group will only advise the magazine, and keep it focused on the "people, trends 
and issues" in San Diego.

First Lady Makes Pitch on Soap: First Lady Barbara Bush will appear as herself 
in the Oct. 18 installment of ABC's daytime soap opera "All My Children." Mrs. 
Bush will not be shown with other inhabitants of the show's fictional Pine 
Valley, but rather appears at the program's end in a public service 
announcement benefiting the National Bone Marrow Registry. The first lady's 
brief spot complements a current story line in which the survival of a child 
stricken with leukemia depends on receiving a bone marrow transplant. Mrs. Bush 
outlines the simple, painless test for bone marrow compatibility and encourages 
viewers to contact the National Bone Marrow Registry. CLAUDIA PUIG

Mapplethorpe Foundation Donates to AIDS Group: A foundation established by the 
late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe has pledged a $3-million donation to the 
American Foundation for AIDS research to be used over a three-year period. The 
money will come primarily from the sale of his photographs, some of which were 
put on trial in Cincinnati in the unusual obscenity case that ended in 
acquittals Friday for the art gallery and its director. The artist died of AIDS 
last year. CLAUDIA PUIG

FASTER PUSSYCAT FALLS BACK ON ITS BACK-ALLEY ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE BAND MAY HAVE A GOLD ALBUM NOW, BUT IT STILL PLAYS WITH AN 
ATTITUDE.

<P>
Now that Faster Pussycat's "Wake Me When It's Over" album has gone gold, the 
question at the Palladium on Friday night was whether the Sunset Strip's prime 
purveyors of sleaze rock had gone soft. 
</P>
<P>
As the group's five members hit the stage, it seemed as if the venue wasn't the 
only thing that had sold out. 
</P>
<P>
At least two Pussycats were wearing faintly crushed-velvet duds, a far cry from 
the no-fuss jeans and leather gear they once favored. And slinky lead singer 
Taime Downe had dyed his signature platinum-blond tresses a respectable shade 
of brown. 
</P>
<P>
But fears of a tamed Pussycat disappeared as guitarist Greg Steele struck the 
snarling opening chords of "Where There's a Whip There's a Way." The 
grunge-guitar, glam-metal band then slammed home one gutter rocker after 
another with an attitude born of Hollywood's back alleys. 
</P>
<P>
The mood turned somber only for "House of Pain," the power ballad that Downe 
dedicated to the late blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan. Ratt's Stephen Pearcy 
and Rebecca Bramlett, daughter of Bonnie, joined the group for far more 
typically spirited encores, including David Bowie's "Suffragette City." 
</P>
<P>
While Faster Pussycat is very much a product of the '80s, second-billed Little 
Caesar could just as easily have been sharing a stage with Bad Company circa 
1975. The group's no-nuances stance renders the music refreshingly timeless. 
Get-dancing tunes and frontman Ron Young's redoubtable vocals combined for a 
solid base of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever talent Maggie's Dream has was rendered moot Friday night by the 
metal-funk outfit's utter inability to project it live. The Palladium crowd 
stood unmoved as Maggie's Dream sputtered through songs from its far more 
impressive self-titled debut album. JEAN ROSENBLUTH

PRICE OPENS UCLA RECITAL SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE CELEBRATED DIVA DELIVERS A MASTERLY RECITAL NEARLY SIX YEARS AFTER 
HER OPERATIC RETIREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly six years after her retirement from the operatic stage, Leontyne Price 
continues to tour as a recitalist and soloist with orchestra. Thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>
But goodness may have not a lot to do with it. Solid technique, a gift for 
communication and her status as a beloved American soprano, an icon, if you 
will, are three of the strong reasons the celebrated singer from Mississippi 
still delights and touches her audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Musical integrity is another important element in Price's arsenal of artistic 
resources. At her return to UCLA, Saturday night in Royce Hall, the 63-year-old 
soprano -- looking radiant, svelte and youthful in matching gowns, sherbet 
green before intermission, True Blue after -- Price gave another object lesson 
in constructing and executing a masterly recital. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the composers with whom she has been associated -- Handel, Mozart and 
Verdi in arias at crucial junctures of the program, Richard Strauss, Joseph 
Marx and Lee Hoiby in song groups, Gershwin and Puccini in encores -- surfaced, 
of course. Yet the program, despite a few familiar points, was a new one, and 
performed with freshness and zest. As always. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, and as at her Orange County appearance two years ago, Price now 
occasionally shows signs of being past her prime, vocally: less available 
breath for longer lines; a decrease in ease of production; some unclear 
enunciation; momentary loss of sound-control, resulting in tones that can 
become raw, hollow or strident. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, these remain on the outskirts of artistic achievement. Beautiful, 
communicative singing is what we have long expected, and received, from this 
singer. And that is what she produced on Saturday with the solid and admirable 
support of pianist David Garvey, her musical associate for these 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
For connoisseurs, perhaps most memorable was the emotional impact in two songs 
by Marx, Strauss and Hoiby, in particular Hoiby's thrilling "Wild Nights," 
"Goodby, Goodby World" and "There Came a Wind Like a Bugle."

TAKE 6 PREACHES A CAPPELLA GOSPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look at the a cappella gospel group's list of credits, and Take 6 takes on the 
appearance of a sextet of expert show-biz schmoozers -- what with TV theme 
songs, TV talk shows, jazz festivals, movies with Spike Lee, an endless list of 
recordings with hotshots. Impossibly friendly and grossly talented, they're the 
utter darlings of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
All of which makes it at least a slight surprise when Take 6 comes to their 
biggest local headlining gig to date -- a sold-out performance at the Wiltern 
Theatre on Saturday -- and is found to be still preaching it -- as in "if you 
don't know whether or not you're on your way, it's time for you to decide." 
Even those who don't share Take 6's evangelical Christian beliefs might have to 
admire their ability to not water down what they do. Industry darlings and pop 
mavericks too. 
</P>
<P>
Few among the Wiltern crowd seemed to be hard-core a cappella fans; the 
broad-based crowd looked an even blend of black and white, of those born again 
and born once. All factions were in equally strong voice in "Spread Love," the 
rare audience participation segment that is also a genuinely musical highlight. 
</P>
<P>
Though these Nashvilleans are adept at creating instrumental sounds vocally -- 
especially Alvin Chea, who for effect plucks his mike cord as if it were bass 
strings -- they're also instrumentalists on their own time, and a brief 
piano-accompanied segment gave teasing preview of how terrific they might sound 
singing non-a cappella R&amp;B and jazz. For now, though, they're sticking to 
their original vocal intent almost as strictly as to the original message.

CLATWORTHY OVERCOMES AT ATLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Benn Clatworthy, the Los Angeles-based tenor saxophonist from London who has 
been earning good airplay with his recent album, led his quartet Saturday at 
the Atlas Bar &amp; Grill on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Although Clatworthy and pianist Cecilia Coleman are capable composers, the 
presence of substitute bass player Ralph Alessi confined them to standard 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
This did not prevent the leader from exhibiting a soaring, Rollins-inspired 
style and sound on "Falling in Love With Love" and a lyrical ballad mood on 
"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye." 
</P>
<P>
With her crisp accompaniment and fleetly ebullient solo work, Coleman is an 
admirable partner. Alessi proved himself a more than able soloist while Kendall 
Kay, the drummer from South Africa, showed discretion, working mainly with 
brushes. 
</P>
<P>
If the limitations of repertoire were a handicap, this was a piece of cake 
compared to the working conditions. The artists were confined to 20-minute 
sets; Clatworthy was forbidden to speak, even to introduce the tunes or his 
musicians. Between sets the customers, most of whom were clearly there to talk 
or eat rather than listen (there was almost no applause, even at the end of the 
tunes), seemed content to be offered 40 minutes of schlock music piped over the 
P.A. system. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Clatworthy's quartet overcame, at least for those few who paid 
attention. It cannot be too long before he graduates to regular work at places 
where his impassioned, energetic sound can be more fully appreciated. LEONARD

BAROQUE ORCHESTRA PERFORMS HANDEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, led by music director Gregory Maldonado, 
opened its fifth season Friday at the First Presbyterian Church in Santa Monica 
with a typically spirited, occasionally problematic performance. 
</P>
<P>
The period-instrument ensemble devoted its concert (repeated Saturday and 
Sunday in Long Beach and Pasadena) to a single work, Handel's "Water Music," 
or, more precisely, to the three distinct suites that make up the complete 
aquatic oeuvre of the composer. 
</P>
<P>
With Maldonado standing at the concertmaster's position, his bow serving 
double-duty as baton, the orchestra displayed a vigorous approach to rhythm and 
a fine sense of the tunefulness of this music. Clearly, the orchestra's 
strengths outweigh its liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The strings, particularly the violins, exhibited an attractively wheezy sheen 
and ready expressiveness. The horns impressed as well, despite momentary 
burbles, with their hand-stopped technique supplying a wealth of articulation 
and color. 
</P>
<P>
The overall success depended upon which suite, and therefore which grouping of 
instruments, was being played. The Suite in G turned out most enjoyable, with 
its pared-down instrumentation of flute and strings revealing diaphanous 
textures and neat execution. Problems with balances and an occasionally heavy 
gait were apparent in the more thickly scored Suite in F, otherwise performed 
with enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Graver faults surfaced with the Suite in D, the valveless trumpet players -- 
their instruments the most different from their modern counterparts of any in 
the group -- proving severely overtaxed. A little inauthenticity, in the form 
of modern valved trumpets, would have gone a long way here -- anathema, of 
course, to a period-instrument group. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a quibble: using the archlute and theorbo as continuo instruments 
looked nice, but they were seriously outgunned most of the time; a harpsichord 
would have been most welcome. TIMOTHY MANGAN

CREATIVE INTERACTION FROM MCLAUGHLIN TRIO;

JAZZ: THE GUITARIST DEMONSTRATES HOW EASILY THE MUSIC CAN INCORPORATE A

John McLaughlin has had so many achievements in his long career that's its hard 
to imagine him finding another peak to climb. Yet his current trio -- with 
Trilock Gurtu on percussion and Kai Eckhard on bass -- is producing music 
easily in a class with some of his finest past accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach in what was, regretably, 
the group's only recent local appearance, McLaughlin and his associates played 
a set that bristled with creative interaction. 
</P>
<P>
The connections between the players were both intuitive and visual. Gurtu sat 
on the floor, Indian drummer-style, behind a cymbal-rich collection of 
instruments. His movements never seemed to stop, touching, stroking and 
striking his various implements -- a mad scientist of percussion, black hair 
flying, mustache bristling, eyes sparkling. On the opposite side of the stage 
McLaughlin -- cooler-looking, smiling, more laid-back -- worked his acoustic 
guitar, constantly reaching out to make electric eye contact with Gurtu and 
Eckhard. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin mixed rapid-fire, Al DiMeola-like runs with snap-crackle chording 
and soaringly lyrical melody lines. Yet, as abstract as some of his lines were, 
he could, on a piece like "One-Night Stand," abruptly shift gears into a series 
of hard-swinging, body moving, funk/soul-driven choruses. 
</P>
<P>
Gurtu's work verged on the remarkable. Firmly based in the extremely complex 
rhythms of Indian classical music, he demonstrated an equally masterful command 
of Western jazz drumming. Bassist Eckhard devoted himself, for the most part, 
to a supporting role, balancing the other players' solo flights with a solid 
rhythmic foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The net result was an exquisite evening of contemporary jazz. The McLaughlin 
trio demonstrated how easily jazz can incorporate a colorful assemblage of 
styles, influences and attitudes under its mantle of creativity. And that's 
exactly the message McLaughlin has been working on -- with continuing 
effectiveness -- for years. DON HECKMAN

YOAV TALMI BEGINS SAN DIEGO REIGN

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't just another opening -- though it did sound like just another show -- 
for the San Diego Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra was still recovering from nearly fatal financial and artistic 
crises Friday night. Nevertheless, the San Diegans began their 63rd season amid 
self-congratulatory speeches, searchlights, celebratory dindins, Champagne 
receptions and a welcome air of optimism. 
</P>
<P>
At least the chronic real-estate woes had been cured. The renovated movie 
palace previously known as Symphony Hall had become Copley Symphony Hall, in 
recognition of a $2.5-million gift from newspaper publisher Helen K. Copley. 
Four local banks, moreover, had agreed to forgive the remainder of a 
$4.3-million debt on the 2,255-seat hall. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had been a frequent guest in the past, Yoav Talmi assumed the 
official title of music director on this occasion. He is scheduled to lead nine 
more programs during the 24-week season. 
</P>
<P>
The promising Israeli maestro wrote a spiffy antiphonal brass fanfare to 
inaugurate the festivities. Before the concert could begin, the orchestra 
manager asked Talmi's wife and children to stand and take a bow from their 
seats in the balcony, to the apparent delight of the large though non-capacity 
audience. It was that sort of party. 
</P>
<P>
A huge program credit, not incidentally, acknowledged the "generous support of 
Dr. Judson and Rachel Grosvenor for their sponsorship of Music Director Yoav 
Talmi." Conductors now function officially as commercial commodities. To this 
we've come. 
</P>
<P>
The piano soloist for the gala event was to have been Andre Watts. When a 
strained neck muscle reportedly caused his cancellation, Horacio Guttierez was 
engaged as stellar replacement. Unaccustomed to dealing with an artistic boss, 
the hasty management neglected to consult Talmi regarding the substitution. 
Luckily, Guttierez seemed to meet with the maestro's approval. 
</P>
<P>
The maestro, for his part, paid San Diego no compliments as regards his 
perception of subscriber sophistication. He selected a lazy inaugural program 
devoted exclusively to instant potboilers from everybody's Greatest Hits list. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with the overture to Verdi's "La Forza del Destino," in a 
thoughtful but overly manicured performance that ignored the vocal 
characteristics of the operatic quotations. The evening ended with a brisk yet 
deftly balanced, slightly fussy yet ultimately climactic performance of Brahms' 
First Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
The best came in the middle. Guttierez -- who will open the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic season next week with Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto -- 
played the same composer's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini with splendid poise, 
nonchalant brio and staggering power. He sustained crisp yet fluid articulation 
even in the most convoluted passage work. He also demonstrated the virtue of 
tasteful restraint, savoring the lyricism of the 18th ("Story of Three Loves") 
variation without drowning the sentiment in honey. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi and the reconstituted orchestra provided sensitive support. The ensemble 
playing turned out to be somewhat untidy, however, in the Verdi and Brahms. 
Sonic textures were further blemished by harsh brass and scrawny strings. 
</P>
<P>
The brave new music director faces some interesting challenges in Copley Hall.

LAND-USE: HOMEOWNERS SAY ORANGE COUNTY'S REFUSAL TO BUY THEM OUT MAKES IT 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO MOVE ELSEWHERE.

<P>
When Mariann Towersey came to this agricultural strip near Newort Beach 10 
years ago, she and her husband knew there was going to be noise from nearby 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But in those days, Towersey recalls, flights were fewer and farther between, 
and the commotion seemed tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
Things today are different. Last week, as Towersey described half a decade of 
battles that she has waged with the county, flights departed every few minutes, 
forcing her first to shout and then wait silently, burning with anger, until 
planes passed. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you like that?" she yelled, glaring daggers at one offending Alaska 
Airlines jet as it drowned all conversation. "What are we supposed to do about 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Towersey is one of a dozen or so neighbors strung along Birch Street, a 
two-lane road just beyond the end of the airport runway, who want county 
officials to buy them out. So far, however, the county has been unwilling to 
meet their price. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trapped here," said resident Fred Peterson, a business teacher at 
Newport-Mesa Alternative Education Center. "The county's willing to pay me 
$363,000 for this place. I can't buy anything like this in Orange County for 
that amount of money, so I have to sit here." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the county has failed to recognize noise as a problem. After a 
long review of the land-use for the area in the early 1980s, the county 
determined that the area around Birch Street would be more appropriate for 
offices than homes. 
</P>
<P>
The land was rezoned, and the transition took hold. 
</P>
<P>
By most measures, it has been a rousing success. New offices are springing up 
along the street, and construction is booming. County planners envision a 
vibrant office park within a few years, one that works in tandem with the 
expanded airport and its new opportunities for business. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think the economic engine that is driving that area is the airport," 
said Tom Mathews, the county director of planning. "What you see out there is 
really progressive." 
</P>
<P>
But that's not a view that's widely shared on Birch Street. 
</P>
<P>
Like his neighbors, Peterson's options are limited: He can't sell his house to 
another homeowner because the area is zoned for office complexes. But his 
property is too small to hold an entire office building, so he's had trouble 
finding a developer willing to complete a deal for the land. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he's entered into negotiations for the property five times, only 
to have escrow fall through. Several doors up the street, a neighbor living 
near a new construction site echoed those complaints, pointing as he did toward 
the growling heavy machinery a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"You think the airplanes are loud," he said. "Try living next to those." 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors blame the delays and frustrations squarely on County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, saying he pursued the airport expansion with a vengeance and 
ignored the plight he was creating for his constituents living in its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows what we've been through, and he hasn't done a thing," Towersey said, 
as a neighbor nodded in agreement. "We were promised that no one here would 
suffer, and I blame him totally." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said last week that he was sorry to hear of his constituents' complaints 
but added that he's available to help if they want his support. "I think you 
know that my door is always open," he said. "I'd be happy to hear their 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the area residents did get out, having taken advantage of a county 
purchase assurance program years ago. But even they say the process was 
infuriating and left them battered. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredibly frustrating," said Jack Mullan, who once lived just around 
the corner from the Towerseys. "I feel sorry for the people who are left. 
They're getting the shaft." 
</P>
<P>
The Towerseys agree. Their house lies in the area that the county has 
identified for a reconfigured Birch Street, and a new arterial street project 
would run directly across the Towerseys' property, so no developer is likely to 
touch it. 
</P>
<P>
But the county still has not funded the road project, so officials say they are 
not prepared to buy out the Towerseys, at least not yet. That leaves the family 
without any likely buyer, and they remain stuck for the indefinite future. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time . . . no particular date has been established for implementation 
of the (street project) improvements," according to a status report written 
this week on what is known as the Mesa/Birch realignment. The report adds that

SECURITY A NIGHTMARE, POLICE AT STADIUMS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: CONTROLLING FANS AT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL GAMES IS PERHAPS THE TOUGHEST 
JOB THE COLISEUM FORCE FACES.

<P>
Los Angeles Police Lt. Alan B. Kerstein had taken a day off from his usual 
duties at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when the unthinkable happened and 
stadium security completely collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The calamitous event did not occur during a heavy-metal rock concert or an 
international soccer match. It was a Los Angeles Raiders football game. 
</P>
<P>
As the clock ticked down on the Raiders' 1984 AFC championship victory over the 
Seattle Seahawks, police and private security officers "lost" the playing field 
to an onslaught of several thousand celebrating fans. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Raiderette cheerleaders and 275-pound linebackers scrambled for safety 
while police officers launched several unsuccessful baton-wielding sorties 
against the unruly fans. Reinforcements, including 10 officers on horseback -- 
a cavalry charge of sorts -- finally succeeded in restoring order. 
</P>
<P>
For Kerstein, who has policed Coliseum events since 1973, the crowd surge was a 
grim reminder that controlling fans at professional football games is perhaps 
the toughest challenge he and other stadium security officials face. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials who monitor crowd safety at the Coliseum, at Anaheim Stadium 
and at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego agree that keeping the peace at a 
baseball game or even a tractor pull is child's play compared to Sunday 
afternoon pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the opera, it's the NFL," observed Kerstein, who supervises Los 
Angeles police officers at Coliseum events. 'You can't expect people to just 
sit there and politely clap and say 'jolly good, jolly good.' " 
</P>
<P>
How to prevent the most violent incidents at football games has become a 
subject of debate since the beating of a 35-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers' 
supporter during a Raiders game last month. The man was briefly in a coma as 
the result of his injuries, but has since been released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was not the first time a fan had been injured at a Raiders game, 
the severity of the beating led to calls for beefed-up security at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Some have advocated a ban on the sale of beer at the stadium, arguing that 
drunken fans are responsible for the rowdiest behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Coliseum officials announced that they would no longer sell beer in 
20-ounce cups, opting instead for 16-ounce containers. The Coliseum Commission 
is now considering implementing a temporary ban on beer sales at Raiders games 
as part of a plan to reduce stadium violence. 
</P>
<P>
An average of 20,000 cups of beer are sold at Raiders games. 
</P>
<P>
While police officials agree that drunkenness is a major contributor to stadium 
violence during football games, they disagree on whether banning alcohol sales 
would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that our most frequent contacts are with people who have had too 
much to drink," said San Diego Police Lt. Bill Skinner, who is responsible for 
security at Jack Murphy Stadium. "But I can't say the problems are caused by 
people who buy beer inside the stadium. There's tailgate parties in the parking 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Beam, director of operations for the Los Angeles Rams, said, "Football 
has always (appealed) to people who want to transfer their hostilities, and 
alcohol increases that urge and cuts down their inhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
For Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim Flammini, who supervises security at Anaheim 
Stadium, home of the Rams, the problems are linked to the nature of 
professional football itself. 
</P>
<P>
When 80,000 people of various temperaments and income levels pack a stadium to 
watch grown men beat each other into the ground for three hours, he said, a few 
slugfests in the stands are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in an environment that is very high in emotions," Flammini said. 
"Professional football is a rough-and-tumble contact sport. It seems to have a 
way of exciting people. . . . If someone says the wrong thing at the wrong 
time, (other fans) might want to defend their team, either verbally or 
sometimes with their fists." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Flammini said, California Angels' baseball games are relatively 
placid events. 
</P>
<P>
"The baseball behavior has been fantastic," Flammini said. "We've had very few 
incidents as compared to last year." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium manager Greg Smith said to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages 
would require an agreement among the city of Anaheim, the Los Angeles Rams and 
the California Angels because the teams and the city split the revenue. No such 
ban has been considered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For police officials, the best defense against ugly incidents at football games 
is to teach officers basic crowd-control strategies and the elements of mass 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coliseum, Lt. Kerstein commands about 80 to 100 Los Angeles police 
officers for most events, although the number of assigned officers has 
increased significantly for Raiders games after last month's incident. 
</P>
<P>
Kerstein said his officers play close attention to sections 1 through 4 and 26 
through 29 because those seats are sold to fans who do not have season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Season ticket holders tend to be much more focused on the game and less 
aggressive," Kerstein said. "For every one fight I'll have within the confines 
of the season ticket area, I'll have 25 or 50 fights outside of those areas." 
</P>
<P>
Another fundamental rule Kerstein teaches his officers is that they should 
avoid plunging alone into the stands to break up a fight. Instead, he said, 
they should work in teams of six. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, four officers break up the fight itself, separating troublemakers as 
quickly as possible from the rest of the crowd in "commando-like strikes," 
Kerstein said. All the while, two other officers guard the rear to ensure that 
the officers are not hit from behind by fans throwing bottles or other objects. 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the unruly fans are then handcuffed in the relative safety of the 
stadium tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go too far into the crowd alone because it really presents an 
officer-safety issue," Kerstein said. "Sometimes I've had to go in alone 
because of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the near-riot that occured when the Raiders beat the Seahawks and the 
fans converged on the field in 1984, the worst day Kerstein can remember was in 
1988, when the Raiders played host to the Rams, who won the game 22-17. 
</P>
<P>
"If sections 1 through 15 had been all Raiders fans and 15 to 31 had been all 
Rams fans, I could have done the whole thing with five cops -- piece of cake," 
Kerstein said. "Unfortunately, every other seat was a Ram fan and the next one 
was a Raider fan. They started fighting 30 minutes before kickoff and were 
fighting an hour after the game ended. It was our worst game." 
</P>
<P>
The situation was also becoming ugly on Sept. 23, when the Pittsburgh Steelers 
fan was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Kerstein said that just moments before the incident, he had called for officers 
deployed outside the stadium to help reinforce security in the stands. Several 
fights had erupted throughout the stadium -- they were small "spot fires" that 
could have become a full-fledged conflagration if action wasn't taken. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting very agitated," he said. "We had a number of problems and a 
number of ejections. A couple of people threw bottles. That's just deadly. That 
could kill an officer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STADIUMS: ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND ARRESTS The relationship between fan violence 
and alcohol sales at Southern California stadiums has been a subject of debate 
since the Sept. 23 incident in which a Pittsburgh Steelers fan was severely 
beaten while cheering his team at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Following 
are figures comparing alcohol consumption by fans and arrest rates at four 
major Southern California stadiums. Police officials note that different arrest 
policies at each stadium have an impact on the number of arrests.

BARCLAY THEATRE PRAISED FOR ACOUSTICS, SENSE OF INTIMACY 
</P>

If the new Irvine Barclay Theatre is Irvine's soul, as one local official has 
dubbed it, then the hall had its first heartbeat Sunday, and those on hand to 
take its pulse were pleased with what they found. 
</P>
<P>
"Acoustically, it sounded very well," said John Praisler, a Laguna Beach 
builder who attended the theater's inaugural concert, courtesy of South Coast 
Symphony, with his 9-year-old son Jeffrey. He was one of several patrons who 
drew comparisons to the Orange County Performing Arts Center as they assessed 
the new venue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's small and intimate and a lot nicer than the Performing Arts Center," 
Praisler said. "You don't feel like you're in a big barn." 
</P>
<P>
With 756 seats, the $17.6-million facility on the UC Irvine campus is about 
one-quarter the size of the Center's main hall in Costa Mesa. Several people at 
Sunday's matinee performance said they liked its intimate feel and gave high 
marks to the auditorium's acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
"That house sounds wonderful," said Irvine Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan, who 
worked for 15 years to bring the theater to a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Ribbon-cutting ceremonies held a week ago gave the public its first chance to 
inspect the new theater, completed on time and on budget, according to general 
manager Douglas C. Rankin. But the first musical strains were not heard until 
Sunday, when a nearly sellout crowd listened to music of Ralph Vaughan 
Williams, Aram Khachaturian and Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
At intermission, the theater's acoustician, Ronald L. McKay, said the acoustics 
"sounded wonderful." But he added that a true assessment could not be made 
until a full range of presentations had been made, such as drama and musical 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to know if we've achieved our goals in a couple of months after 
all those programs have been done," McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Smith of Garden Grove found the plush velvet seats comfortable, though he 
felt they could have been "a few inches wider." He mentioned that he enjoyed 
being able to order coffee at the theater, a forbidden pleasure at the "more 
formal" Center. 
</P>
<P>
No seat at the new facility is more than 60 feet from the stage, a fact that 
didn't escape Dorothy Sauvageau of Orange, who was also glad that her home 
county now had another theater for live entertainment. Local groups as well as 
nationally known artists and troupes are scheduled to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to drive to the Shubert Theatre (in Century City) and it always 
rained," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
And Doug Park, a UC Irvine sophomore, said the venue would increase the 
university's artistic cachet. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a long time to build this, but it's kind of like there's culture to 
our school now," he said.

2 CANDIDATES DISAGREE ON HOW TO RUN OFFICE

<P>
Michael R. Capizzi and James G. Enright, candidates in the November race for 
district attorney and longtime adversaries within the office, showed voters 
more than just their cool attitudes toward each other in their first pair of 
debates last week. 
</P>
<P>
They also made clear sharply contrasting viewpoints on how they would run the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, chief deputy for 24 years, vowed he would show leadership to the 
deputies within the office by taking on courtroom cases himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be an administrator if you haven't been in that courtroom and are 
current," Enright said. In fact, he said that if budget cuts are required, his 
first priority would be to cut down on administration to keep from losing any 
courtroom deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"I would cut out some of the memo writers," Enright said. "I would cut out some 
of the duplication that we may have in the area of administration." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, who was appointed district attorney by the Board of Supervisors in 
January to replace Cecil Hicks, who was appointed to a judgeship, insisted that 
with a $40-million budget and a total staff of more than 600, what the office 
needs at the top is a sharp, full-time administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"The D.A. cannot immerse himself in a trial and isolate himself from the 
day-to-day operation of the office," said Capizzi, who had been chief assistant 
under Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first one-on-one confrontation between the two since the June 
primary, when Enright garnered enough second-place votes in a four-man race to 
force Capizzi into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The first debate last Monday, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, will air 
on public-access cable stations before the Nov. 6 election. A second debate 
last Wednesday will air on KOCE (Channel 50) on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi generally avoided appearing on the same programs as Enright during the 
primary. His campaign consisted mainly of countywide mailers to selected 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
But Enright's surprisingly strong showing may have been a factor in forcing 
several changes in Capizzi's strategy. He has matched Enright in putting up 
street signs, which he refused to do before the June vote. And he has included 
in his campaign weekend precinct walking by volunteers from within the office. 
For the June primary, he would not permit help from any workers in the office. 
</P>
<P>
The first debates reflected themes that each of the candidates emphasized in 
the June race. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi noted his endorsements: every police chief in the county, the 
association of deputy prosecutors and a handful of law enforcement 
associations. Twice in one debate he brought up that he was Hicks' choice to 
replace him as district attorney. Capizzi is also proud that he was the 
unanimous choice of the Board of Supervisors in January. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, as he did in June, tried to paint Capizzi as "the politicians' 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
"I am a professional prosecutor; I am not a politician," Enright said. "I 
believe the district attorney must be independent from all sources of political 
power within the county." 
</P>
<P>
But their supporters believe the differing views on the district attorney's 
role may be a reflection on their own careers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Enright was chief deputy and Capizzi's boss in the early years, 
Capizzi emerged as the leader in the office in the early 1970s. To everyone in 
the office, he was clearly Hicks' choice as replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Enright ended up attending fewer and fewer administrative meetings. Some of his 
supporters say he did not attend because his opinions were ignored anyway. 
Capizzi supporters say Enright simply lacked interest in the administrative 
details of running the office, which happened to be Capizzi's strongest 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's debates, Enright acknowledged that the district attorney must be 
an administrator. But he stressed what he sees as two other important functions 
of the job: leading in the courtroom and working with community leaders to 
solve narcotics and gang-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's emphasis was on working with budgets, dealing with the Board of 
Supervisors and making sure the office programs work. 
</P>
<P>
"The D.A. must administer that office," he said. "And to say otherwise is to 
suggest that fighter pilots should be operating the ships and dealing with the 
tank battalions." 
</P>
<P>
Enright has no shortage of issues to work with: He has criticized Hicks and 
Capizzi because they chose to continue their work with federal prosecutors in 
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal instead of joining the state 
investigation, where indictments have already been handed down. Enright has 
attacked Capizzi for placing what he calls unfair subtle pressure on deputies 
to work in his precinct-walking campaign. And during the debates, Enright 
questioned why Capizzi needed to wait for federal prosecutors before resolving 
the issue of whether Republican poll guards broke the law in intimidating some 
Latino voters in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
During the debates, he also criticized Capizzi's credentials as a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, you've never prosecuted a narcotics case," Enright said. Not 
true, Capizzi answered. 
</P>
<P>
"You've never done a homicide case," Enright asserted. Again, Capizzi answered 
that the charge simply wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi countered that Enright was full of double talk. For example, he said, 
referring to the issue of deputy support, Enright has Assistant Dist. Atty. 
Edgar Freeman working in his campaign and was seen on television at a political 
news conference with Freeman and Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef. Avdeef finished 
third and Freeman fourth in the June primary and have thrown their support to 
Enright. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue in this race is who is best qualified to administer and lead 
the office into the 21st Century," Capizzi said. 
</P>

in January when former Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks joined the Superior Court bench. 
Capizzi joined the district attorney's office in 1965 and became an assistant 
district attorney in charge of special operations in 1971. He was officially 
appointed chief assistant district attorney by Hicks in 1986 but had been 
functioning in that job for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Political affiliation: Republican 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Capizzi is emphasizing his role in recent years as the top 
administrator in the office. He has also chalked up most of the major 
endorsements, such as from the county police chiefs and the deputy prosecutors 
association. In addition, Hicks recommended that Capizzi replace him as 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi has made few comments critical of opponent James Enright but has warned 
that if Enright slings too much mud during the next few weeks, it could 
backfire on him. "People who live in glass houses should watch out," Capizzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
James G. Enright 
</P>
<P>
Home: Orange 
</P>
<P>
Age: 63 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Chief deputy district attorney. He was appointed chief deputy in 
1966 by Hicks and has remained in that job ever since. However, the role of 
chief deputy has dramatically changed. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Enright 
was second in command. But as Capizzi's power within the office grew, Enright's 
role became that of full-time overseer on courtroom cases, with homicide cases 
his specialty. After the June primary, Capizzi moved Enright out of the 
executive office suite. 
</P>
<P>
Political affiliation: Enright is a lifelong Democrat who switched to the 
Republican Party earlier this year in protest of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr.'s new control over the state's Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Issues: Enright has attacked Capizzi for using deputies and investigators 
within the office to walk precincts for him on weekends. He has also tried to 
show voters that he has more courtroom experience than Capizzi in major cases. 
He has tried to brand Capizzi as the "politician's candidate" because of his 
appointment by the Board of Supervisors as district attorney.

MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH IN CONDO;

CRIME: THE EARLY-MORNING KILLING IN A QUIET, UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD OF RANCHO 
SANTA MARGARITA LEAVES RESIDENTS STUNNED.

RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 911 emergency call came at 6:08 a.m. Sunday. A dying man at 53 Gaviota 
asked for help. 
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes later, county Fire Department paramedics arrived to find a man 
with a gunshot wound slumped against a wall of his small, one-bedroom 
condominium. He died about an hour and a half later at Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said the man was in his 40s or 50s. He said 
investigators could not identify the victim pending further investigation. 
Olson said no motive had been established for the crime, which is being 
investigated as a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor in an adjacent condo said he heard a gunshot about 6 a.m. and saw a 
man fleeing on foot. "I don't think it was a burglary because the man who was 
running away wasn't carrying anything, and he had plenty of time to steal 
something," said the neighbor, who asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor said the suspect fled the area in a car that had been parked 
nearby. "He took off to the cul-de-sac, and I heard the squeal of tires. He 
obviously had someone in the car waiting for him, for even before the car door 
slammed, I heard the squealing of the car taking off. It was too little time 
for that man to have gotten in the car and started it himself," the neighbor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other residents of the upscale condo area said they were shocked and 
fearful. "We moved here because we thought it was quiet and peaceful," said a 
young woman who lives in a condo close to the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Olson agreed that homicide is rare in the new planned community of Rancho Santa 
Margarita: "We just don't get calls like this from out here. This is a really 
nice area." 
</P>
<P>
Gaviota is a small street about 200 yards north of Rancho Santa Margarita 
Parkway. The normally quiet area of white condos with red-tiled roofs was 
jarred on Sunday morning by the influx of investigators and reporters. Yellow 
tape denoting the crime scene blocked off swatches of sidewalk and the victim's 
condominium. The screen from his living room window lay on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the emergency call to paramedics came from the victim, who lived 
alone in the downstairs, 510-square-foot condo. "Sheriff's deputies and 
paramedics were dispatched to the residence," Olson said. "When paramedics 
arrived, they found the front door ajar. The victim was found inside the condo, 
propped against a wall, and it appeared he had been shot." 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the victim had lived at the condo for a short time. He declined to 
comment on how the gunman might have entered the victim's home, where the 
victim was shot or whether he had been shot more than once. 
</P>
<P>
But a neighbor who asked not to be identified told The Times that he watched as 
the victim's body was removed and saw a gunshot wound to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the victim apparently was divorced and had two small sons, about 
5 and 7 years old, who visited him on weekends periodically. 
</P>
<P>
One woman said, "That's the only time I'd see the man outside -- when his 
children were visiting. They called him 'Dad,' and that's how I know he was 
their father and not their grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew the guy's name," said one man. "He'd lived here about six months, 
and he was very much a loner. We'd just say 'hi' in passing."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RED CROSS TRANSFERS BLOOD TESTING TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to cut costs, the Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross 
has consolidated its blood testing operations, transferring nine employees to 
the Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The move should not affect quality or delivery of the 300,000 pints of blood 
distributed annually to 40 hospitals in Orange County, said Arell Shapiro, 
regional medical director of the Red Cross blood services program. 
</P>
<P>
Collections will continue to be processed and blood components produced in the 
Orange County laboratory, she said. "Little will change except where the actual 
test tubes go," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one blood bank director worried that emergency testing would not be 
available during off hours. "They will be providing the service but it will be 
inconvenienced by long distance and delays," said Jose Ocariz of the UCI 
Medical Center blood bank.

<P>
The Ventura City Council today will consider applying for a $50,000 grant from 
the National Endowment of the Arts to place public art at the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The public art grant request would be added to a $3.5-million package put 
together by the city and the state of California to restore the pier, which is 
the largest of its kind in the state but has deteriorated so much that its 
outer portion is closed. 
</P>

A Ventura parks spokeswoman said she is optimistic that the city will get the 
NEA grant if it applies. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

RECYCLING POLICY ADOPTED BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recycling policy for all materials used by the city -- including recycled 
paper, asphalt, machinery and solvents -- has been unanimously approved by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting the policy last week, the city will purchase recycled products as 
long as they meet required standards and the cost is not more than 5% over the 
price of virgin products. 
</P>
<P>
Not all recycled products prove cost-efficient. Although the city can save 
almost 20% in costs for recycled letter pads and envelopes, the price increases 
by 25% for recycled white paper, according to a report by Simone Friend, the 
city purchasing manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to reduce paper use by photocopying on both sides of a 
sheet. It also will avoid purchases of glossy paper and plastic foam containers 
that cannot be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Laurann Cook said that by adopting the policy the city can set an example 
for citizens and other cities to follow. ROSE APODACA

RESTAURANT MANAGER IS BEATEN BY ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The manager of an El Pollo Loco restaurant was struck repeatedly with a 
baseball bat when he was unable to open a safe quickly enough for a band of 
robbers, Irvine police said. 
</P>
<P>
Four men wearing ski masks and gloves and armed with knives and the bat entered 
the restaurant, at 88 Corporate Park, at 12:25 a.m. Sunday through the front 
door, Police Sgt. Tom Little said. 
</P>
<P>
They confronted manager Mariano Perez, 30, of Laguna Niguel and employee Jose 
Rodriguez, 24, of Santa Ana and demanded a key to the safe. 
</P>
<P>
When he was unable to open the safe, one suspect struck Perez several times on 
the head and shoulders and demanded that he open it. But before Perez could 
comply, the suspect struck him several more times on his upper body. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects tied up the two employees with nylon cord, put them in a small 
locker room and fled with between $2,500 and $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 minutes, Perez and Rodriguez were able to free themselves and called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
They were treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to Irvine Medical 
Center. Both men were treated and released.

COUNCIL TO TAKE UP ENCROACHMENT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are expecting a large crowd tonight when the City Council takes 
up the issue of beachfront property owners who have built small patios or walls 
that extend onto public property. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's public hearing on the so-called encroachment issue will be the first 
since a citizens' committee presented its recommendations to the council in 
April. It also represents one of the last opportunities for public input into a 
land-use amendment on easement infringements, which has been on the city agenda 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the 600 houses between the Santa Ana River and the tip of the Balboa 
Peninsula, there are 295 where decks or landscaping extend beyond property 
lines onto a public easement, according to city records. Some walls stretch up 
to 27 feet beyond property lines. 
</P>
<P>
The council will be considering not only the conclusions of the citizens' 
committee -- which recommended that the local coastal plan allow encroachments 
of up to 15 feet for a yearly fee -- but also a second recommendation developed 
in early August by the Planning Commission. The commission has called for a 
limit on encroachments of 10 feet, with a phase-out period of three years. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council may also disregard both options and send the issue back to the 
Planning Commission for further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever action is taken by the council will have to be approved by the 
California Coastal Commission. In July, the Coastal Commission said in a letter 
to the city staff that its main objective was to improve the public's access to 
the beach. One possibility for such improvement would be extension of the 
beachfront sidewalk, which now runs between the Balboa Pier and 36th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents have expressed dismay at previous public hearings on a sidewalk 
extension, arguing that the boardwalk is both noisy and a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has become a political hot potato for council members, four of whom 
face reelection in the Nov. 6 election. At a recent candidates' forum, all four 
declined to discuss the encroachment limitations, arguing that it is 
inappropriate for council members to take a position on an issue before it 
comes up for city review. LAURA MICHAELIS

<P>
COAST HIGHWAY WIDENING BEGINS

<P>
Slower traffic and more congestion will accompany a three-month road-widening 
project now under way on Pacific Coast Highway between Golden West Street and 
Beach Boulevard, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-million project, which began Oct. 1, will widen the highway from two 
to three lanes in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
However, engineering manager Jack Miller said, the project will consume 526 
parking spaces that must be replaced before the new lanes can be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to build a 300-space parking lot on the ocean side of Pacific 
Coast Highway between 11th and Golden West streets. Miller said the city also 
wants to construct a 226-space lot north of the Huntington Beach Municipal 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The road-widening project, paid for with county Unified Transportation Trust 
funds, will also repair the deteriorating asphalt surface on the 2-mile section 
of road. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic engineers said drivers should seek alternative routes through the area 
between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;

<P>
DISTRICT, TEACHERS UNION ON SAME SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Parents who attended back-to-school night last year were more likely to find 
angry teachers carrying picket signs than information about the coming school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, both sides are ushering in what they hope is a new era of 
cooperation, with a joint project by the teachers' union and school district 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The district and the Capistrano Unified Education Assn. split the cost of 
printing more than 15,000 copies of "Parent Power," a pamphlet written under 
the auspices of the National Education Assn., which represents teachers' unions 
on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two weeks, the six-page publication will be distributed at 
back-to-school nights throughout the district, at sites including Dana Hills 
High School, where teachers staged a large demonstration last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The leaflet contains reading, writing and math activities for parents to do at 
home with elementary children and topics to discuss with older students. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet also includes a school calendar, phone numbers for each school in 
the district and the number for union headquarters in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be the first time the teachers' association and the district have ever 
worked together on such a project," said union president Ric Stephenson, whose 
signature appears alongside that of Supt. Jerome Thornsley on the pamphlet's 
cover letter. "The community is used to seeing negative activities between the 
district and the school board, and we hope they see (the pamphlet) as a 
positive gesture." 
</P>
<P>
Thornsley said the publication is a way of showing the public that the two 
bodies can work together. 
</P>
<P>
"During the heat of negotiations, many things are said, but the fact is we 
frequently cooperate, we're just doing it in a more visible way," Thornsley 
said. CHERYLANNE BEALER

6 MORE ACRES OF PARKLAND URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A board member of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an environmental group, is urging the 
City Council not to adopt a long-range development agreement with the 
Huntington Beach Co. unless the pact includes six more acres of donated 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has scheduled a special meeting for tonight at 7 to consider 
the development proposal. If approved, it would grant the Huntington Beach Co., 
the city's biggest landowner, a 15-year agreement to build in the 750-acre 
Holly-Seacliff area northwest of the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The company is proposing to donate up to 41 acres of parkland if the City 
Council accepts the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Lorraine Faber, a board member of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, said Sunday that 
the city should demand six more acres -- specifically the six acres of 
Huntington Beach Co.-owned land adjoining Central Park at the corner of Ellis 
and Edwards streets. 
</P>
<P>
Faber said those six acres are needed to connect Central Park to the county's 
forthcoming Bolsa Chica Regional Linear Park. The linear park design calls for 
connecting Central Park, about 6 miles inland, with the wetlands and oceanfront 
of Bolsa Chica at Pacific Coast Highway. Faber said the Huntington Beach Co. 
owns a key piece of land needed for the new county park. 
</P>
<P>
The key parcel, known as Parcel 19, is at the northeast corner of Edwards and 
Ellis, Faber said. 
</P>
<P>
"This parcel is the linchpin, and if it's not obtained by the city now, with 
this agreement, the Huntington Beach Co. will continually use the land as a 
carrot on a stick to get future concessions from the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Huntington Beach Co. have said the city would benefit from 
the development agreement because the company, in donating 41 acres, would be 
giving more parkland than state law requires. 
</P>
<P>
Faber, however, said that a portion of the 41 acres is undevelopable. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of that land is wetlands or coastal bluff that the (California) Coastal 
Commission would not allow the Huntington Beach Co. to develop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would allow the Huntington Beach Co. to build 3,780 houses in the 
Holly-Seacliff area. It would also allow the company 11 acres of commercial 
development and 54 acres of industrial construction in Holly-Seacliff. BILL

TEEN PLAYING WITH GUN FATALLY SHOOTS SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seconds after a friend's warning not to play with a handgun, a Palmdale 
teen-ager put the revolver he thought was empty to his head and pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Sanders, 16, died instantly Saturday from a single shot to the head from 
a .44 magnum revolver he had been waving playfully at two friends, Los Angeles 
County coroner's investigator Eugene McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the boy and his friends had been drinking before the shooting, 
but it was uncertain whether they were intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Ronald Thomason said Sanders took the gun from the living room 
of his house in the 3100 block of East Avenue Q-13 about 10:30 p.m. The gun 
belonged to his mother's boyfriend, who left it out because he planned to go 
hunting Sunday morning, Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
From the living room, Sanders walked to the front steps of the house and 
pointed the gun in jest at two friends, Shane Patrick Sheahan, 19, of Las Vegas 
and Darrell Timothy Worelds, 21, of Palmdale. Sanders ordered his friends not 
to move before he placed the barrel of the gun against his temple and fired, 
Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, a junior at Desert Winds Continuation School in Lancaster, collapsed 
on the front steps and was covered by a blanket when deputies arrived. He was 
declared dead at 10:40 p.m., but coroner's officials said Sanders died 
instantly from the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Sheahan reportedly had told Sanders not to play with the gun and urged him to 
put it away seconds before the fatal shot was fired, Thomason said.

GALLEGLY'S FLYERS TAKE SOME FLAK; 
</P>
<P>
FRANKING: THE DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER SAYS MAILERS ARE A WASTE OF MONEY. A 
SPOKESMAN REPLIES THAT THE INCUMBENT HAS SUPPORTED REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Democrat challenging Rep. Elton Gallegly accused the incumbent of using 
taxpayer-supported mailers to strengthen his 1990 reelection campaign and of 
being among the biggest spenders in the House of Representatives on newsletters 
to constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) spent $185,179 on mass mailings in 1989, which ranked 
him fifth among California's 44 House members in 1989, a new study by a 
national taxpayers group says. 
</P>
<P>
Richard D. Freiman, an Agoura attorney and TV writer opposing Gallegly in the 
November election, said the incumbent's reported spending on five mass mailings 
in 1989 was a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
"These are puff pieces for Gallegly," he said. "Most people throw them out 
because they don't have any information that is important or necessary in 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy surrounding the franking privilege, under which Congress spent more 
than $100 million last year on mailings, led to extensive reform in the U.S. 
Senate in 1989 and to less extensive restrictions in the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the congressman said Gallegly supported those reforms, voting 
to reduce the number of mass mailings by House members from six to three a year 
beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly also voted to limit the mail privilege -- a popular congressional 
benefit since 1793 -- even though he remains convinced that the newsletters are 
useful tools in communicating with constituents, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman believes it's an important way of keeping in touch with the 
district," said John Frith, Gallegly's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Frith said surveys have shown repeatedly that district residents like the 
newsletters and want them to continue. He said, however, that only about 10% to 
15% of households in the district respond to such surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly's 21st Congressional District includes parts of western and northern 
Los Angeles County and southern and central Ventura County. The cost of his 
mass mailings was reported late last month by the National Taxpayers Union, a 
200,000-member nonprofit group that lobbies for reduced government spending. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Pierce, spokesman for the group, said the study shows that the average 
expense by a congressman on newsletters in 1989 was 31 cents per household. By 
comparison, Gallegly spent 71 cents for each household in his district, Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said the figures in his group's study are not precise because the exact 
spending of House members on mass mailings are confidential. But most, 
including Gallegly, confirmed the number of mailings from their offices. A 
minimum figure was derived from that.

SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER CRASHES CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of drunk driving crashed into another car on the Santa Ana 
Freeway early Sunday, injuring himself and several others. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol spokesman said that Jose Luis Saavedra, 25, of 
Santa Ana, suspected of being intoxicated, was driving north on the Santa Ana 
Freeway at a "high rate of speed" about 1 a.m. Sunday when he rear-ended 
another car north of the Main Street off-ramp in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The car, driven by Jay Shaver, 47, of Whittier, went out of control, hit a 
signpost and overturned down an embankment. Shaver was uninjured but an 
unidentified passenger sustained serious injuries and was taken to Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Saavedra was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange. His three passengers 
suffered minor injures.

CLOSURES OF SCHOOLS DOMINATE FOUR RACES; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: ELEVEN CANDIDATES SEEK FOUR SEATS ON THE OCEAN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT 
BOARD OF TRUSTEES. A LACK OF REVENUES HAS STIRRED THE MOST INTEREST. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two incumbents stepping down and a group of political hopefuls demanding 
change, the Ocean View School District Board of Trustees race is likely to be 
among the county's liveliest contests in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven candidates are seeking four seats on a school board that has experienced 
one of its stormiest years in recent memory, including protests by angry 
parents over proposed school closures and demonstrations by teachers over 
stalled contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
Two incumbents are seeking reelection: board President Charles Osterlund, who 
is seeking another four-year term, and Trustee Carolyn Hunt, who is seeking an 
unexpired, two-year term. Board members Elizabeth A. Spurlock and Janet Garrick 
decided to step down, largely out of frustration, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine challengers in the race have criticized the board as being stagnant, 
disjointed and fiscally irresponsible. They offer a diverse range of ideas on 
what should be done to quell labor unrest among teachers and how harmony can be 
restored to the often-divided board. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing issue, however, is whether schools should be closed to help 
balance the district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The district is operating at a budget deficit exceeding $1 million, even after 
cutting $1.4 million in spending from last year's plan. That crisis compelled 
the board in June to consider closing three schools with low enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
An outcry by hundreds of parents persuaded board members Garrick, Hunt and 
Marcus to delay closures for at least a year. However, the financial problem 
persists, and the new board this spring will again have to wrestle with the 
question of whether to close schools in the face of public protest. 
</P>
<P>
Osterlund, who voted against the majority in June, said he will continue to 
push for school closures unless other budget alternatives arise. He charged 
that the board shirked its responsibility by refusing to close schools last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nine candidates for the four-year seats, Osterlund is joined by 
former high school administrator Flint Morrison and bilingual-education 
activist Tracy Pellman in favoring school closures to help trim the budget. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Ball, former chairman of the district's budget committee, contends 
that financial woes can be remedied without closing any schools. 
</P>
<P>
The other five candidates for the three seats said they would close schools 
only under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Randall J. Clifford, another budget committee member, said school closures 
should be considered only to reduce class size or if the money saved by 
closures "wouldn't be squandered." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Engquist, district personnel commissioner, said school closures would be 
"painful" but added that "my mind is not closed to the possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Lottie Hobbs, who helped lead the parents' drive to keep open Golden View 
School, one of the three that had been targeted for closure, is opposed to 
closing any schools unless the aim is to improve educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Kanode, who is leading the effort to establish a Huntington Beach 
shelter for runaway teen-agers, argues that the board should consider 
reconfiguring its combination of K-6 and K-8 schools before closing any sites. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Vanderhook, an organizer in youth sports groups, said he would consider 
closing schools "only as a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the two-year seat, Steve Buhrig, who served on the board's 
advisory committee to consider the school closures, agrees with Osterlund that 
school closures may be inevitable to bail the district out of its budget 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, Buhrig's opponent for the unexpired term, said she would continue to 
explore all means of raising revenue and cutting spending to avoid school 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who has served on the board for nine years, said she is seeking 
reelection to the unexpired term, rather than a full, four-year term, because 
she wants to retire from the board soon. She said she would have stepped down 
this year but was afraid that three incumbents leaving the board at one time 
might have created massive upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue facing the district is improvement of bilingual education. Last 
year, Ocean View came under scrutiny by the state for being Orange County's 
last district to submit an acceptable plan for increasing its number of 
bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
That process is now moving forward, but the district is working to desegregate 
heavily Latino Oak View School to prevent a clampdown by the state Department 
of Education, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, candidates will have to address teachers' labor unrest, which 
reached new heights during 1989-90. During contract talks, which were stalled 
for more than a year, teachers picketed and boycotted extracurricular 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year contract was finally reached in June, but it expires in June, 1991, 
so talks between the union and administration will probably heat up again early 
next year. The teachers' union has promised to take an active role in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OCEAN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
These are the candidates running for the Ocean View School District Board of 
Trustees in the Nov. 6 election. There are three four-year terms to be filed 
plus a two-year opening that will be left when Elizabeth A. Spurlock leaves the 
board in November. Incumbent Janet Garrick is not seeking re-election while 
incumbent Carolyn Hunt is vying for the two-year seat.

MIKE PENNER: FOR RAMS, ONLY RACE LEFT IS ONE FOR WILD CARD SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
First came the bye, then came the goodby. Refreshed, relaxed, rejuvenated and 
replenished by a week off from their bone-crushing business, the Rams returned 
from retreat Sunday afternoon and immediately retired from the NFC West race. 
</P>
<P>
Four games down and three games out. Earlier in the week, Coach John Robinson 
had called the scenario "unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
But then Cincinnati field goal man Jim Breech split the uprights in overtime, 
culminating an excruciating 34-31 Ram defeat, and Robinson was left to think 
long and hard. 
</P>
<P>
"This loss was very heartbreaking, obviously," said Robinson, looking down, 
apparently scouting out a soft place to land. "One and three is difficult. 
Obviously, many of you are going to predict our doom, but it doesn't have to be 
that way. We've had bad situations before and have come back and we will 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson spoke with all the conviction of a Victor Kiam apology. His Rams are 
1-3, with a trip to Chicago next on the ledger. The 49ers are 4-0. If the Rams 
were getting sick and tired of wild-card duty, they'd better start cozying up 
to the idea again, because one month into a new season that's all there is. 
</P>
<P>
"It (stinks). It really (stinks)," fullback Robert Delpino said. "That's the 
best (way) I can put it. I haven't seen us in this tough (of a situation) in 
three years. And the most depressing part is what the 49ers are doing." 
</P>
<P>
What the 49ers are doing is not losing, which is what they usually do. The Rams 
don't normally do much losing either, at least not until the playoffs, so they 
were wearing their January game faces a lot earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was devastating," quarterback Jim Everett said. "Definitely. I think the 
expectations for the L.A. Rams was never to be 1-3. We have to look at it. 
Hopefully, we can learn from it." 
</P>
<P>
And learn what? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams already know how to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they can learn from the Bengals, who had absolutely nothing going for 
them at time of kickoff. They were coming off a Monday night loss to Seattle. 
The Rams had them outrested, 13 days to six. Eddie Brown, their best receiver, 
was out with a knee injury. And Sam Wyche, their coach, was out $30,000 after 
barring a woman reporter from his locker room, incurring the wrath of 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and turning the Bengals' postgame interview routine 
into an NFL test case. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Wyche opened his locker room to all reporters -- men, women, even a man 
dressed as a woman (the joke was a drag) -- but erected a curtain to keep all 
of them away from the heinous sight of his players removing their pads. 
</P>
<P>
They said the Bengals couldn't win under such a big tent, but sometimes, 
distractions speak louder than words. "As a team, we were thrown into a 
situation that brought us together," Breech said. 
</P>
<P>
And as an opponent, the Rams brought the best out of the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati managed all of 230 yards Monday night against Seattle. Twenty 
minutes into Sunday's game at Anaheim Stadium -- after 24 plays from scrimmage 
-- the Bengals had 232 yards and a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Rams began to do some things right. First, they handed the ball 
to Cleveland Gary, who illustrated what Robinson should have known all along: 
He's no Curt Warner or Gaston Green. Gary rushed for 92 yards, scored two 
touchdowns and actually ran over and around defenders -- a first for a Ram 
tailback this season. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, and consequently, the Rams came back. The slightest threat of a Gary 
gain gave Everett an extra second to scan from the pocket. With a little time, 
Everett was able to pass for 372 yards and a pair of scores. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came down to winning time, long into the afternoon, the Rams turned 
conservative, a strategy that works better for Orange County politicians than 
Orange County football teams. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 31-28, with less than two minutes left in regulation, the Rams were 
faced with third and nine on the Cincinnati 26. Everett was shredding the 
Bengal defense, but Robinson and offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese chose 
ground transportation instead and ran Delpino up the middle on a draw play. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino was stopped after a three-yard gain. Mike Lansford was called on to 
kick a field goal, he delivered and the game was headed for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insisted he wasn't playing for the tie. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not at all," he claimed. "We anticipated a big play. We thought they'd 
spread out their defense and we'd spring him for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did Robinson's plan in overtime to punt on fourth and one from 
midfield, hoping to pin the Bengals far from the winning points. Robinson 
pinned the Bengals back all right -- Cincinnati took over at its own 11 -- but 
two passes from Boomer Esiason to Harold Green put the ball on the Ram 40 and 
from there, it was only a matter of time before Esiason moved it further into 
the reach of Breech. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought about going for it on fourth down," Robinson said, "but we felt the 
best decision was to punt deep. If you don't make it and give up the ball at 
the 50, two plays and they're in field goal range. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to give our defense a 20-yard field. A 20-yard field puts you 
out of the game in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Everett was less than enthralled with either decision. "I get the plays called 
for me and try to run them the best I can," he said tersely. Gary literally 
walked away from the question, shaking his head and saying, "I ain't going to 
comment on that." 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of talk typical of a team having fallen hard on its 
aspirations. Super Bowl or bust, the Rams busted a day before Columbus Day. At 
1-3, they look at their chase of the 49ers and see the same thing the Bengals 
saw in their locker room Sunday.

FINALLY GETTING CHANCE TO PLAY, RAMS' PIEL MAKES THE MOST OF IT

<P>
For a guy who didn't expect to get much playing time Sunday, Ram nose tackle 
Mike Piel had no problems getting ready for the fourth quarter of the Rams' 
34-31 overtime loss to the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Piel, a reserve, slowed two Bengal drives in the fourth quarter, allowing the 
Rams to tie the score, 31-31, and force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
He sacked Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason for a seven-yard loss and later 
stopped running back Harold Green for a two-yard loss on a third-and-one 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great chance for me to get some work," said Piel, who played two 
seasons at Saddleback College before moving on to Illinois. "I was just happy 
to get in there." 
</P>
<P>
Piel's playing time was limited last season when he dislocated his left elbow 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm feels great and I feel confident again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Jim Breech, who kicked a 44-yard field goal in overtime to win the 
game, said the controversy surrounding Bengal Coach Sam Wyche and women 
reporters in the locker room didn't overshadow the Bengals' victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big win for us and everything else is insignificant," said Breech, 
who also kicked a 40-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. "All I'm going to 
look at (today) is the boxscore and see 'Field goal, Breech, 44.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wyche, who was fined a record $30,000 for barring a woman reporter from the 
Cincinnati locker room last Monday night, had a little plea for the mass of 
media members grouped around him after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little pot in there on the right and when you go in (the locker 
room), if you would just drop in a dollar or a half-dollar, anything you can 
do. I guess we need a bigger crowd than this to make up the money I'm out, but 
it might be worth the cost if we can operate the way the rest of the world 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Turnbull, a sports reporter with KVEN radio station in Ventura, arrived 
at Wyche's postgame press conference wearing a gold-tassled wig and a brown 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
"I particularly like your hair," Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull, who normally doesn't wear dresses to Ram games, said he wore it as a 
gag. He paid $3.98 for the size extra-large dress at a thrift store. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to lighten up what was a deadly issue," Turnbull said. "I hoped 
some people would see the humor in it. This isn't the Middle East we're talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' no-huddle offense caught the Rams napping early in the first 
quarter. As the Rams tried to run in their nickel defense, Cincinnati snapped 
the ball with at least 15 Rams on the field. Unfortunately for the Rams, none 
of those 15 were covering James Brooks, who caught a 26-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals declined the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche said his team "stunk up the house" during last Monday's 31-16 loss to 
Seattle, but Cincinnati came out of the first half Sunday smelling like roses. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals had 230 yards of total offense against the Seahawks. Against the 
Rams, they had 234 yards with 9:31 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Say What? The Bengals' Natu Tuatagaloa was called for an unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalty on a punt return in the second quarter, but Steve Lopez, the 
press box public address announcer, had another complaint to register. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen-yard penalty on Tuatagaloa," Lopez announced, " . . . for having a 
name that's too hard to pronounce." 
</P>
<P>

Receivers might have better chance of joining circus and catching bullets in

These guys aren't exactly bringing home the groceries, but then if they tried, 
they'd probably drop them, too. Stop Anthony Miller, and that's that.

Eric Floyd's no longer a starter and you thought there was no good news Sunday. 
In-jured Courtney Hall plays on because alternative is Mike Zandofsky.

Pass rushers do the unimaginable: They make Brister-Strom look impressive. Les

Gary Plummer has now scored as many TDs as Les Miller and one more than Walter

Like Boston's bullpen, if it comes down to these guys, there goes the old

Blame the blocked punt on Fuad Reveiz. That's what Jack Clark would do, and the 
more you see 'em, don't they remind you of a certain baseball team?

TUSTIN PARTNERS TRAVEL WORLD FOR NEW IDEAS TO AMUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Woodyard, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James E. Harmon, David H. Schmitt and Stephen J. Clark travel the world 
dreaming up new theme parks and other entertainment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Partners in the firm of Management Resources in Tustin, the three have worked 
on projects as diverse as Lusolandia, a theme park in Portugal that would 
re-create the Middle Ages, to Steeplechase Park, which would renovate New 
York's Coney Island to return it to its glory days as an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 The company provides consulting services for the leisure industry, 
particularly theme parks and expositions. Though Management Resources has drawn 
up elaborate sketches for some clients, financing for major projects has been 
so tight that few new ones are being built. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also planning a floral and garden show in Columbus, Ohio, 
marking the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing in America, and 
the conceptual design of a major casino resort in Lorain, Ohio. It is also 
helping to plan the 1992 World Exposition in Seville, Spain, and the 1995 
World's Fair to be held in Budapest and Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners all learned the amusement business trade during careers at the 
Walt Disney Co. They left in 1980 to establish Management Resources, drawing on 
their collective experience. Today, they operate from modest offices in Tustin 
and have a branch office in Florida. But with projects all over the world, they 
often spend more time in airplanes than in their offices, where the walls are 
adorned with artists' renderings of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times staff writer Chris Woodyard, Harmon and 
Schmitt discussed trends in the leisure industry. Clark was traveling on the 
day of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the state of the theme park? Can we expect new ones? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: As far as theme parks, our sense is that you are not going to see 
too many more, if any, (in the U.S.) because of the massive capital investment 
that is required. What we're excited about is the application of show and 
entertainment products that would be typically seen in (theme parks) being 
applied to other locations. We're doing a lot of work with shopping center 
owners and developers in incorporating show product and entertainment product 
in regional and super-regional malls, which is a growing trend for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt: The growth of the theme park industry will be in Asia and Europe. 
We're working on one park in Portugal. In the Asian countries, I would venture 
to say there's probably six to 10 in the planning or development stage. This 
market is saturated with $100-million-plus products. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So the international market is untapped territory? 
</P>
<P>
ASchmitt: That's fair to say. I think a lot of entrepreneurs and developers 
have come over here, used Disney as their primary example, have seen what Tokyo 
Disneyland has done and view it as a great business opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you expect an international shakeout of theme parks in a few years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: This business is like any other. It requires good management, good 
conceptual development in the planning stage and good implementation. So, there 
is going to be a shakeout of the successes and failures of the business, and 
that is good. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon: We have thought a lot about that. If you look at Europe or Asia and 
compare them to North America, you could say the market is 10 to 20 years ahead 
in this country. When some new operators develop parks in these less mature 
markets, sometimes they do not pay enough attention to proper planning and 
operation. They think that all you have to do is open the doors and people will 
flock to it. It's not that way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the mature American theme park? What are the challenges for older 
parks such as Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm? How do they keep these parks 
fresh and attractive to visitors? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: Keeping the product fresh . . . is the key to any mature business in 
that you have to go through the reinvestment strategy. And then good service, 
good management, fair value for your dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How can theme parks get employees to treat visitors with courtesy and keep 
up a high level of service? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: I think it's a combination of things. Oftentimes, (theme park) 
owners and operators will say, "Young people today don't have the work ethic or 
the values to look at a job with the same intensity as they did 10 years ago." 
We don't necessarily believe that. It's a different ballgame today. I think 
Disney has demonstrated year after year that if the organization is committed 
to a philosophy of good service and backs that up with internal programs and 
funding then you can retain a high level of service. Disney has created such 
high expectations among the consumer. They have the best bricks and mortar in 
the industry. But they put equal emphasis on the human factor in their 
organization, and I think that's what makes them successful. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon: We have to look at why people go to theme parks. At our company, we 
view service as an absolute key ingredient to success. You can have the 
greatest attractions in the world, but if the guests don't have a good time, 
they won't come back. We believe service . . . is very, very important. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you keep a park fresh without massive capital investment? 
</P>
<P>
AHarmon: In our business, we talk about that kind of reinvestment as "soft 
costs." We view them as special events, the use of entertainment in which you 
are creating reasons for people to come back that don't necessarily relate to a 
hard attraction. That has always been a strategic marketing tool as the cost of 
building new attractions rises. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are those "soft costs" you talk about more important than ever as the 
economy slows down and businesses reduce their spending? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: I think they are. Special anniversaries, special events, they will 
be the marketing attraction for that next year. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon: It's becoming increasingly difficult for an owner or operator to 
justify putting $20 million to $40 million into a new attraction and make it 
economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are the capital reinvestment costs of amusement parks so high because of the 
popularity of high-priced thrill rides? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: There are two ways to look at it. Disney takes a thrill ride like a 
Big Thunder, Space Mountain or the Matterhorn. The ride system itself -- the 
sleds and track -- is just one element. The facade, backdrop and the "preshow" 
of that whole experience is just incredible. In some other parks -- those we 
call "iron ride parks" -- the operators go to major manufacturers, primarily in 
Europe, and buy attractions and rides like major roller coasters. On those, you 
see the entire ride and all the supporting structure. Disney doesn't do it that 
way. Disney tries to maintain the theme and ambience of the environment even 
though it costs tens and tens of millions of dollars more. It pays well in 
excess of the cost of the specific ride itself. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon: The theme park is becoming a bigger reinvestment because you do a 
bigger, more sophisticated roller coaster. You are trying to outdo yourself 
every year and it is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the "iron rides" will continue to be king of the parks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: I think in certain markets, the thrill ride has been very 
successful. If you look at the Six Flags Corp. organization; they have done a 
very good job of utilizing the iron-park mentality. Part of that question has 
to be answered with: "What is the ambience that management is trying to 
create?" They are all very sensitive to where the market is going, age- and 
demographic-wise, and so it's a difficult question to answer. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon: It is a question of what segment of the market a park wants to go 
after. Back to your question of whether they will add more rides every year, 
that thinking is more pronounced here in Southern California because you have 
such a competitive environment. You've got everything from Magic Mountain to 
Knott's Berry Farm to Disney. Other attractions vie for leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Consequently, are theme parks having to aim more at attracting different 
groups of patrons. Is there a lot more segmentation of the market than there 
used to be? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: In the broadest sense, I think they all are geared towards the 
traditional family market, and I don't know how you define family today as 
opposed to 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that has been talked about a lot in the last five or six years in 
this industry has been the participatory kinds of experiences, where you have a 
different experience every time. There is a resurgence of miniature golf. There 
are more activities that are hands-on, where you can create your own 
experience. You are not buckled in and you don't do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where does this experiential trend come from? Is it left over from the video 
game craze? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: I think that's part of it. I think that people truly like as much 
realism in an experience as they can get, feeling like they are actually flying 
a plane or are in a spaceship. I think you will see more parks putting in heavy 
capital dollars to build a facility and put a show into it. But that show will 
have the ability to change the experience or change the show without having to 
construct a new building. 
</P>
<P>
You'll see more of what we call motion-based simulators. Disney introduced the 
Star Tours attraction several years ago, which created a sensation of space 
travel through film and the actual movement of your chair. What this allows 
Disney to do is create an experience that will run for a year or two or 
whatever. Then, by changing the program in the film, you can have a brand-new 
show without heavy capital infusion. The filmmakers and manufacturers of the 
simulators are teaming up and looking at new applications. I think you'll see a 
lot more of that, not only here, but overseas as well. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much of a role have computers played in rides, particularly with these 
motion simulators? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: The use of computerization has been around a long time with a 
number of these attractions. 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: In fact, the initial technology came from military and airline 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Where do you think the continued application of this technology will lead 
over the next few years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: Actually flying to the moon (laughs). We spend a lot of time in our 
industry visiting people who design and build audio-animatronic figures and who 
produce film for simulators. It is unbelievable how much research and 
development money is being spent in our industry to develop new products. It's 
not always a totally new product, but a new application of existing technology. 
And where that leads to when we go to a park in the future, I don't know. But 
there are going to continue to be some exciting things out there. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt: I think our industry is begging for the next generation of new product 
and, as Jim said, there is a lot of research going on. It's an area we're 
concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides motion simulators, what other trends will we see in the rides of the 
future? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: I think you will see more and more attempts to create an experience 
for the guest in which they experience something that appeals to all their 
senses -- sight, sound, movement, smell, touch. There was a product that was 
previewed at Expo '86 (in Vancouver, Canada). They used everything from film to 
slides, etc. They even released various scents in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see some technologies on the wane? Is there a loss of interest in 
some other types of things? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: I think there is a decline in the simple use of audio-animatronics. 
I don't think the market is going in that direction any more. 
Audio-animatronics, which Disney created I don't know how many years ago, was 
really unique when it came out. It was really something to watch Mr. Lincoln 
stand up and talk. It's still neat, but the uniqueness is on the wane. It's a 
product that everyone has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon: Static exhibits force you as the guest to read a lot or work at being 
entertained. It's easier for you to be entertained by sitting down in a seat 
and letting it happen; that is where people are gravitating. Museums and other 
institutions are trying to change their presentations. They are trying not to 
erode the learning while also trying to make it more entertaining. The museums 
are competing with theme parks, attractions, water parks or whatever for 
leisure-time dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Q. It's been said that places such as Las Vegas thrive in a troubled economy 
because people go there to forget their troubles. Is the same true of theme 
parks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: I think it depends on what region of the country you are talking 
about. If you look at parks that are located in regions where the vast majority 
of their attendance is local -- in Southern California, that's definitely true 
-- they'll probably be less affected by a recession. Attractions or theme parks 
that are more dependent on tourists, as opposed to local business, will be much 
harder hit. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about new markets? Aren't amusements in enclosed shopping malls a 
relatively new phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: It began with the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta. It's an enclosed 
theme park in a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the concept spreading? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: Versions of it are. I think it is very difficult, depending on the 
market, to justify an investment of that magnitude and expect a decent return. 
Developers are creating family entertainment areas that distinguish their malls 
from the competition, generate more traffic and increase the length of time 
people spend at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
One client of ours is opening such a mall in Clarksville, Ind., in late 
October. We think it is going to do extremely well. One that opened about two 
years ago in Cincinnati has done extremely well. We don't think that part of 
the business has reached its potential. As developers get more comfortable with 
the financial results of these centers, they will be willing to stretch a 
little further. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the product you see today in malls is pretty conventional stuff. You 
have a carousel, miniature golf, kiddie rides. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will this concept spread to the West, even though the weather is better here 
and people like to be outside? 
</P>
<P>
A. Harmon: Yeah, I think it will pretty much be a national phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Schmitt: I think it has application all over the company. It may be more 
enticing to developers to introduce that product in eastern or northeastern 
markets where you have more severe weather during the winter. But I think you 
will see it in the Southeast and on the West Coast as well. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does this represent the evolution of the mall into a destination resort? 
</P>
<P>
A. Schmitt: Many of the larger retail centers today are becoming the modern 
town squares. You look at malls today, and they are a place to go for 
entertainment. We've seen the emergence of food courts. It's a natural 
extension to take economically sized entertainment products and mix them into 
these larger regional centers because they really add to the experience of an 
afternoon at the mall. Mall developers are getting into it because they want 
their center to be unique. Theirs is a maturing business as well. There are a 
lot of malls out there now. Years ago, there were ice rinks and roller rinks. 
This is the next step: the mini-mini theme park.

In the News: The man who played Lou Grant on the TV drama of the same name said 
a book on media bias reminds him of the pressures his program faced. "Corporate 
pressure" and "the powers that be" in Washington can influence content of 
television news and dramas, Ed Asner said at a reception late last week in 
Washington, D.C., for "Unreliable Sources: A Guide to Detecting Bias in the 
News Media" by Martin Lee and Norman Solomon. "Lou Grant" dramatized public 
pressures on journalists.

Full Circle: Ronald Reagan will dedicate a sculpture made from parts of the 
Berlin Wall at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., on Nov. 9, the first 
anniversary of the day the wall was breached. The work is by Edwina Sandys, one 
of Winston Churchill's granddaughters. It was at that college 44 years ago that 
her grandfather spoke of an "iron curtain" descending across Europe. The Berlin 
Wall was erected in 1961. 
</P>

Gala Goof: Princess Diana, garbed in fuchsia silk, was guest of honor last week 
at a charity gala in Washington, D.C., boycotted by some prominent people. The 
high price of tickets was the ostensible reason for the absence of some of the 
event's organizers, including television personality Barbara Walters and 
Georgette Mosbacher, wife of the secretary of commerce. Tickets to the benefit 
cost $2,500, or, for those who wanted to shake Diana's hand at a reception, 
$3,500. Only 260 tickets were sold, and the hall was well short of full. 
</P>
<P>
Booked Up: The world's largest private collection of books on Rome sold for 
about $4 million during a three-day sale last week in London, Christie's 
auctioneers said. Top price for the sale was $240,000 paid anonymously for a 
14-volume set of 18th-Century architectural etchings. The books had belonged to 
Franklin H. Kissner, an American who died in 1988.

ALEXANDRA, WHO WILL VISIT ORANGE COUNTY THIS WEEK, IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST 
POPULAR AND ACCESSIBLE ROYALS

<TEXT>
<P>
When she was a child, she liked to turn cartwheels and be called Sandra, and 
her ambition was to be a circus bareback rider. 
</P>
<P>
She did become an accomplished horsewoman, but these days you don't call her 
anything but "your Royal Highness." Because Alexandra Helen Olga Christabel, 
Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, Hon. Lady Ogilvy, GCVO, has a richer 
royal pedigree than the Queen of England. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra arrives in Southern California this week to lend the 
British Royal Family's presence to the Festival of Britain in Orange County, 
residents will get a look at not only the Queen's first -- and favorite -- 
first cousin, but a descendant of King George V, King Edward VII, Queen 
Victoria, King George I of Greece, King Christian IX of Denmark and Czar 
Alexander II of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Though she is unknown to most Americans, Princess Alexandra is considered in 
Britain to be one of the most popular and accessible of the royals. She is just 
outside the orbit of the queen's immediate family, but throughout her adult 
life she has taken on the role of what has come to be known as "professional 
princess," representing Britain and the Royal Family at official engagements at 
home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
She wears the royal mantle lightly, however. 
</P>
<P>
She is "easily one of the most popular of the royals, a woman of unstuffy charm 
and classic beauty, regal in presence but highly accessible," author Ralph G. 
Martin wrote in his book "Charles and Diana." 
</P>
<P>
"When she was Diana's age," Martin wrote, "she was also known as a marvelous 
dancer, a gay conversationalist who loved to laugh, adored children, had a 
craving for sweets and was a ballet addict. Her favorite jazz piece was 'Ain't 
Misbehavin'.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, in her professional role, "she's got an enormous interest in whatever 
she's doing," said Sir Eldon Griffiths, a member of Parliament who lives part 
time in Orange County, lectures at UC Irvine and is the president of the county 
office of the World Affairs Council. "That's the main thing that comes across. 
She does her homework and she's very well briefed. She, in fact, goes at it 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's Festival of Britain visit will be the first time she has traveled 
to the county, but her brother, the Duke of Kent, and his wife were made 
honorary citizens during a 1985 visit to dedicate a Laguna Hills housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The princess visited Los Angeles in 1971 in a promotion of British men's wear 
and will return there briefly Oct. 15 and 16 briefly after her Orange County 
visit. Among other things, she will meet with Mayor Tom Bradley, visit Union 
Avenue Elementary School and observe a program for mothers of children born 
with a crack addiction at County Harbor/UCLA Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Mitchell, the princess' private secretary, said from London that Alexandra 
was "delighted" by her last visit to Southern California and "thoroughly enjoys 
travel," although her schedule while on tour is always tightly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of schedule has become meat and potatoes for most members of the 
Royal Family, said John Houlton, a British vice consul based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They take their profession quite seriously," he said. "We think the princess 
in a sense serves in an ambassadorial role. She's a figurehead that people are 
interested in meeting." 
</P>
<P>
And it is interesting that in a country of people whose ancestors absolutely 
hated King George III, modern British royals are often received with the sort 
of adulation usually reserved for rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
"In California," Griffiths said, "royalty is a rarity, and its scarcity value 
gives it a much higher profile. There's a curiosity that is much more acute 
here than in Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Mere curiosity, however, does not fully explain the liquid looks that members 
of the British Royal family see turned on them when they come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it intriguing too, I have to say, that people in the U.S. -- and in 
France too, which is also a republic -- are so intrigued," Houlton said. "I 
think that part of it is that the Royal Family are very much a national symbol 
of something that has endured for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It has an air of majesty and romance to it. They're a symbol of permanence in 
a rather impermanent world these days. I think that's appealing even to 
countries that have no wish to have a monarchy of their own." 
</P>
<P>
Princess Alexandra has felt the glare of celebrity almost all her life. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Christmas Day, 1936 (her fourth name commemorates her birthday), 
Alexandra is one of three children, and the only daughter, of Prince George and 
Princess Marina, Duke and Duchess of Kent. Her birth, said her grandmother, 
Queen Mary, was "the only nice thing to have happened this year" -- the year of 
the abdication of Edward VIII. 
</P>
<P>
She can trace her paternal lineage to Queen Victoria and, on her mother's side, 
to Czar Alexander II of Russia (Queen Elizabeth is descended from royalty only 
on her father's side). 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's father, the son of King George V and Queen Mary, died in 1942 in a 
plane crash on his way to tour Royal Air Force bases in Iceland during World 
War II. The princess was raised at Coppins, her family's country home in the 
Buckinghamshire village of Iver, by her mother, who was a daughter of Prince 
Nicholas of Greece and his wife, the former Grand Duchess Helen of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alexandra's mother was known as one of the most stylish and glamorous 
royals of her day, she enrolled her daughter as a student at Heathfield, an 
exclusive English girls' boarding school -- making Alexandra the first British 
princess to attend a regular school. 
</P>
<P>
She continued her formal education in the winter of 1953-54, when she attended 
a finishing school in Paris. When she returned to England, she took a nursing 
course at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, where 
she was known simply as Nurse Kent. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1950s, Alexandra had begun to take on more official royal duties, 
but she had also come to be known as an eligible young princess and began to be 
seen more in London social circles. 
</P>
<P>
Confrey Phillips, a English-born pianist who performs regularly at the Westin 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and once played in London hotels and 
nightclubs, remembered that during that time Alexandra was "a very likable 
lady. At that time she was first sort of stepping out. She liked to be with 
friends and have a nice social evening somewhere privately. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had my nightclub in Mayfair (The Colony on Berkeley Square) she'd come 
along with her friends and a couple of times with her husband-to-be, although 
that hadn't been announced at the time. She liked dancing and loved music." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently loved Phillips' music, because Phillips said he and his trio 
were hired to play at Buckingham Palace for the princess' 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 200 people there," Phillips said, "and it was a great 
success, a great party. There was continuous dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing kept up, Phillips said, even when his band took a break. A group of 
Princess Alexandra's friends who were amateur musicians acted as a relief band. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not at all aloof," he said. "She's very relaxed and always has a lovely 
smile and a wonderful soft disposition about her. She's not wet and frumpish, 
like some of these aristocrats can be. She's the least forbidding person you 
could meet." 
</P>
<P>
During the time she knew Phillips, Alexandra also became acquainted with a 
young commoner named Angus Ogilvy. Born in 1928, Ogilvy was the younger son of 
the Earl of Airlie and grandson of Mabell, Countess of Airlie, who was a close 
friend and lady-in-waiting to Alexandra's grandmother, Queen Mary. After an 
eight-year friendship, the princess and Ogilvy were married in Westminster 
Abbey on April 24, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, by his choice, was not catapulted into the aristocratic stratosphere by 
his marriage. When the Queen offered him an earldom (a common practice when a 
princess marries someone of lesser rank), Ogilvy refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should get a peerage just because I married a princess," he 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Queen did confer a knighthood on Ogilvy in 1989, making him a 
Knight Commander in the Royal Victorian Order. 
</P>
<P>
A businessman who is on the boards of directors of several British companies, 
Ogilvy accompanies the princess on many of her trips abroad (he will come with 
her to Orange County) and is properly addressed as Sir Angus. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogilvys have two children, James Robert Bruce, born in 1964 and married to 
Julia Rawlinson, and Marina Victoria Alexandra, born in 1966 and married to 
Paul Mowatt. Neither are titled and are not considered to be royal. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy once underscored the somewhat hybrid nature of his immediate family by 
referring to its members as "mini-royals." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's many tours, duties and appearances entitle her to receive money 
from the Civil List, which is an allowance given to members of the Royal Family 
by Parliament to help pay for staff and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the public wrongly assumes that all royals are rich," Martin wrote. 
"Princess Alexandra . . . had no money of her own. Neither did Angus Ogilvy, 
since his older brother inherited both the family title and the family 
fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths said he believes that the Princess was the first member of the Royal 
Family to drive herself routinely and to ride the Underground rather than be 
chauffeured. (In fact, in 1962, she crashed her Austin Mini into a truck on 
London's Kensington High Street. She later admitted that she had been driving a 
bit too fast.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra does have an extensive collection of jewels that have come to her 
through her royal relatives. But the woman wearing the gems, so firmly rooted 
in royal tradition, apparently has little use for any pretense that might be 
attached to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the sometimes-stifling pomp associated with royal appearances, 
she has shown a sense of good-humored proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget," she said of the Royal Family in the 1960s, "that nowadays we 
have to compete with Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles."

The Orange County Airport Commission has recommended that the curator of John 
Wayne Airport's first exhibit, Community Arts Inc. of San Francisco, be hired 
for another three months at up to $30,000 to organize a second exhibit, an 
airport official says. The commission has also asked the Airport Arts 
Commission to report back within 45 days on the possibility of hiring local 
firms and artists to put together the art program's two remaining exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
It additionally requested information on ways to reduce the program's $125,000 
first-year budget. The art commission had recommended that Community Arts 
Inc.'s contract be extended for the remainder of the fiscal year for $98,500, 
but some local artists complained that Orange County professionals were being 
overlooked. The Orange County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the 
contract extension Tuesday.

'PURSUIT OF MARVELOUS' EXPLORES MIND OF SURREALIST 
</P>

A flavorful blend of mysticism, physics, psychology and social commentary 
surrounds "Pursuit of the Marvelous" at the Laguna Art Museum. The exhibit 
offers a sampling of paintings and prints by three surrealists from foreign 
parts who all touched down for long or short spells in California during the 
1940s: American expatriate Charles Howard and Englishmen Stanley William Hayter 
and Gordon Onslow Ford. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was a temporary base for Howard, a summertime hangout for Hayter, 
and an adopted home for Onslow Ford. As lecturers, exhibitors and colleagues of 
local artists, the trio apparently helped to invigorate an art scene that was 
in the process of throwing off its allegiance to realist painting and beginning 
a brief love affair with abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
But, oddly enough -- except for some preliminary remarks in the catalogue by 
associate curator Susan Anderson -- the California context remains shadowy. The 
show, which includes work from the 1930s, '40s and early '50s, does not dwell 
on the question of whether the change of scene made any impact on the three 
artists' work, and it includes no examples of their legacy in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the exhibit offers a glimpse of the output of three 
mystically inclined individualists, at least two of whom -- Howard and Onslow 
Ford -- still have significant claims on our attention. 
</P>
<P>
Howard was born in 1899 in New Jersey to a family of artists and architects who 
resettled in Berkeley when he was an infant. In his early 30s he married a 
British painter and moved to London, where the tense pre-war climate gave his 
work a new sense of foreboding. He spent the war years in the Bay Area, putting 
in a stint as a muralist for the Works Progress Administration, exhibiting 
widely and lecturing at the California School of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
A buddy of mobile artist Alexander Calder, Howard was also intrigued by making 
abstract forms move in space; a critic once called his work "dynamic 
architecture." But his mature paintings, dating from his years in London, also 
reflect unresolved tensions between chaos and order, between the mystical 
energy of natural forces and the limpid clarity of intellectual theory. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's delicate compositions consist primarily of flat and subtly modeled 
curving forms jiggered into pinpoint balances. His "architectural" finesse 
lends an air of tension and mutability -- an urgency -- to shapes that might 
look whimsical in another context. 
</P>
<P>
In "Generation" (1940), crisp orange, brown and white shapes simultaneously 
suggest natural imagery, organic matter viewed under the microscope and the 
tools of a chemistry lab. "The First Hypothesis" (1946) has more Orwellian 
overtones, with its web of fine, nervous line, its contrasts of blood red with 
buttoned-up gray and white, and the two huge leaf or blade forms that almost 
touch, enclosed within a vaguely mechanical, pulleylike framework. 
</P>
<P>
Onslow Ford left England for the artist's life in Paris in 1936, when he was in 
his early 20s, and became a member of the official surrealist group. Under his 
and Chilean artist Matta's influence, a new wave of surrealists rejected the 
type of "dream" imagery associated with Salvador Dali's figurative work in 
favor of abstract explorations of the cosmic unknown. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, after he had resigned from the group and sojourned in New York and 
Mexico, Onslow Ford settled in San Francisco. There, his interests came to 
embrace Zen Buddhism, Japanese calligraphy and the notion of art as a way of 
meditation. In 1951, he and fellow painters Lee Mullican and Wolfgang Paalen 
formed the Dynaton group, dedicated to locating rhythms and forms suggestive of 
the great cosmic beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Floating through the luminous spaces of his pre-San Francisco paintings was an 
eccentric but orderly landscape of concentric circles, angular floating planes, 
grid lines, light beams and blobs of protoplasm -- in his view, an image of 
"the secrets contained in the universe of the human mind." 
</P>
<P>
In some paintings, rhythmic patterns of dots aerate the canvas in a visionary 
way. "Migrators with Birds" (1944) is somewhat reminiscent of Australian 
aboriginal art: Overlapping flat shapes of pale color are laced with tightly 
marshaled patterns of daubs, dots and wavy lines, as if to demarcate paths 
taken through sacred territories. 
</P>
<P>
Onslow Ford's California paintings in the exhibit are markedly bigger and 
baggier, with imagery veiled behind irregular "vertical blinds" of broken 
color. The artist believed such works actively promoted a meditative experience 
for the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
Serious-minded as it was, this effort is harder to appreciate. In the next 
decade, the "light and space" artists would figure out how to evoke meditative 
states without interposing the static of specific imagery. 
</P>
<P>
Hayter, who was born in 1901 to a family of artists, studied chemistry and 
geology before concentrating wholeheartedly on art. Printmaking was his passion 
and challenge. In Paris in the 1920s he founded a print workshop where he 
developed several innovative processes and became intrigued by the subconscious 
investigations of the surrealists. San Francisco lured him only briefly, in 
1940 and 1948, for teaching gigs. 
</P>
<P>
Hayter's big goal was to merge "the unconscious element from which inspiration 
comes, and extremely rational control of the methods of execution." Using 
clashing, acid-toned colors (considered bizarre at the time), deliberately 
ambiguous superimposed images, and intricate webs of line, Hayter aimed to fuse 
the concepts of space and time. Viewers who entered the energized fabric of his 
prints were to find themselves peering into their "own internal reality." 
</P>
<P>
Although his evident fascination with women in extremis might give rise to pop 
psych queries about his relations with the opposite sex, most of Hayter's works 
in the exhibit seem ingrown and precious, too fussily concerned with technique 
to register on an emotional plane. The major exception is his painting, 
"Ophelia," from 1948, in which fiercely ricocheting thick black line and 
radiating bursts of red and yellow create a terrifying mask of a face twisted 
by madness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pursuit of the Marvelous: Stanley William Hayter, Charles Howard, Gordon 
Onslow Ford" (part of the Festival of Britain, an arts festival and retail 
promotion) remains through Jan. 13 at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive, 
Laguna Beach. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.

Tropical Storm Klaus weakened into a depression and moved further into the open 
Atlantic after unleashing wind and rain that left at least six dead and 1,500 
homeless in the northeastern Caribbean. Klaus briefly reached hurricane status 
Friday, but was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday and then dropped to 
depression-level winds of 35 m.p.h. Sunday evening, forecasters in Miami said.

Charles Littler's dream of starting an experimental community based on 
cooperation and centered around art began coming true one Sunday in 1968. He 
spotted a newspaper ad for a rundown dude ranch on 80 scorpion-infested acres 
outside this community. Price: $67,500. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw this place I knew I had to do it or it was all just talk," says 
Littler, then a University of Arizona art professor who had been searching for 
a location for five years. 
</P>
<P>
He found 10 families, mostly other art professors and graduate students, 
willing to plunk down $1,000 apiece for a down payment and moved into the site, 
35 miles north of Tucson. Today, Rancho Linda Vista is thriving, one of the few 
experimental communities founded in the '60s still operating. 
</P>
<P>
Littler can hardly believe that the community he envisioned has lasted so long. 
"The first years were chaotic and difficult," says the 62-year-old Littler, who 
sports a ponytail and a blue stone dot earring. "Everyone had a different idea 
of what this place should be. I wasn't sure we'd survive." 
</P>
<P>
Like other so-called hippie communities that popped up at the time, Linda Vista 
was a commune, complete with a ranch grocery store that ran on the honor system 
and talk of pooling incomes. But all that collapsed as bigger problems arose. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of wanderers drifted in. A bus carrying the Universal Church of Music 
broke down in Oracle, depositing 30 people, some infested with head lice, on 
the ranch's doorstep. Some stayed for several months before they were invited 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"People came from all over thinking this was a place to squat and do drugs," 
says Artis Hernbrode, an early resident. "Some came with a critical attitude 
because we worked and were trying to pay the mortgage. I remember one guy 
saying, 'You probably even use deodorant.' " 
</P>
<P>
But ranch residents weren't exactly old-fashioned. Nude swimming in the ranch 
pool was common. So was smoking marijuana, dabbling in psychedelic drugs and 
free sex. Oracle, which at the time had 2,500 people and 14 churches, couldn't 
figure out these long-hairs. Relations soured when artist Andy Warhol came to 
Linda Vista to film scenes for "Lonesome Cowboys," a movie he was making. 
</P>
<P>
Some Oracle residents and their children came to watch, not realizing that 
Warhol was shooting a rape scene that day. As the scene unfolded, pandemonium 
ensued. Picnickers grabbed their kids and scattered. The sheriff thought things 
were weird enough to call the FBI. The next day the hills around Linda Vista 
were dotted with dark-suited G-men peering down through binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Woodin, a writer and 20-year resident, says: "People thought that's what it 
would be like out here -- one long rape scene." 
</P>
<P>
But the unusual had been usual at the property well before 1968. In its dude 
ranch days, Linda Vista was a playground for Hollywood big names such as Rita 
Hayworth and Gary Cooper. Illustrator Andy Rush says that history made it 
easier for the people of Oracle to accept their hippie neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't long before we were treated like home boys," says Rush, a former 
Marxist art professor, now chairman of the Oracle Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Over 22 years, Linda Vista has settled into comfortable middle age. The 
mortgage was paid off two years ago. For its 20th anniversary, children who 
were raised there returned to celebrate, some with their children. Residents 
are now talking of starting a graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
Although squabbles are common, ranch life continues to be close-knit. The 
property is communally owned and bills are paid in common. Big decisions, such 
as putting in gas piping in all of the white adobe homes that dot the desert 
hills, require the consensus of the 35 residents. And the once-untamed 
lifestyle reflects the maturity of the community, with many residents shunning 
alcohol, tobacco and even caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
"Art has kept us together," says resident painter Margo Burwell, who designed a 
56-page brochure for the 20th anniversary party. "Everything derives from that. 
It's the common purpose." 
</P>
<P>
The ranch maintains a regular schedule of shows in the art barn, a centrally 
located building that also houses 12 studios, sponsors a modest scholarship 
program and holds frequent poetry readings and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Founding father Littler, a small, intense man who bristles with ideas, has 
retired from teaching and is now organizing what he calls art camp-outs, in 
which up to 100 artists will gather in Western wilderness areas to make and 
show art that promotes ecological awareness and respect for the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Littler and his wife, Pat Dolan, recently won a commission to design sculptures 
along the nearby Canyon del Oro River. But whatever future projects he 
undertakes, Littler says he will never leave Linda Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of this place as a real life art project," he says. "Mondrian (the 
noted abstract artist) was a proponent of the idea of art disappearing and 
becoming part of everyday life. I look at this community as an expression of 
that idea."

WAR PLANS: The Bush Administration, growing more and more pessimistic about 
prospects for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East, has stepped up its 
efforts to lay the groundwork for using force against Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III aggressively buttonholes diplomats to ask 
how their governments would vote on a possible United Nations resolution 
authorizing the start of military action if the current economic sanctions 
don't produce results soon. Also on his mind: Would they come to the defense of 
Israel if that country were attacked in any Mideast flare-up? 
</P>
<P>
So far, the reactions generally have been positive, and the Administration is 
busily preparing for its next step -- pushing through a resolution in the 
United Nations Security Council that would authorize multinational military 
action if Saddam Hussein doesn't get out of Kuwait soon. 
</P>
<P>
Still, planners here caution that the White House isn't rushing into war. 
President Bush reportedly wants to allow all would-be peacemakers reasonable 
time to try friendly persuasion -- and for the United States to get its forces 
into place -- before deciding whether to unleash allied bombers and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE RACE: Part of the split in Congress during last week's House debate on 
the bipartisan budget accord stemmed from politics of a different sort -- the 
jockeying over who will be the next House Republican leader in 1992 after 
current Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (D-Ill.) retires. 
</P>
<P>
Partly to help stake out a clear philosophical position, each of the three 
major candidates -- Reps. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) and 
Jerry Lewis (R-Highland) -- took a different position on the budget accord: 
Lewis supported President Bush, Gingrich bolted from the Administration and 
Hyde straddled the fence. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress-watchers say the outcome was inconclusive. Gingrich won the day on 
the floor, where lawmakers defeated the budget resolution, but he lost a friend 
at the White House, where Bush reportedly is incensed over the Georgia 
lawmaker's audacity. The White House is expected to try to undermine Gingrich's 
bid in any way it can. 
</P>
<P>
POINTING FINGERS: Tempers bristle between the State Department and the White 
House National Security Council over who is to blame for not having made it 
clear enough to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein earlier this year that the 
United States would react strongly if his forces invaded Kuwait. Baker's 
supporters plead that the secretary of state was too busy worrying about 
Eastern Europe even to take notice of Hussein's early blustering. State 
Department loyalists argue that NSC should have been more alert itself. The two 
often have clashed historically. 
</P>
<P>
FISCAL CASUALTIES?: Last week's failure of the bipartisan budget agreement has 
raised speculation that President Bush may dump one of its major architects -- 
possibly Budget Director Richard G. Darman or Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. 
Brady. Darman and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu triggered a 
backlash in Congress, where members apparently resented their ruthless tactics. 
Brady is increasingly being blamed for mishandling of the savings and loan 
debacle. But insiders say that any change -- if it comes -- wouldn't occur 
until after the elections.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the big movie screen at the town hall auditorium here Sunday, a grim-faced, 
bearded soldier explained how to jab an anti-nerve-gas syringe into the thigh, 
while in the audience, teen-age youngsters hooted and hollered as if they were 
at a showing of Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the jumbled mood in Israel as the government began to hand out gas 
masks and anti-chemical-war agents to the entire population of 4.7 million 
citizens. The distribution is the biggest anyone can recall since Britain was 
under air attack from Nazi Germany in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
On a practical level, the Israeli project has aroused some controversy. How 
effective is the equipment, anyway? Will people have time to fasten the masks 
as missiles rain in? What if someone is on the street or at work and his mask 
is at home? 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has threatened to strike at Israel with an arsenal 
of chemical weapons if United States and allied forces in the Persian Gulf 
invade or if a United Nations-sanctioned trade ban chokes his country. Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir defends the distribution of gas masks "because we take 
his threats seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Comments by Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of Israel's central region, 
suggested that the dispensing of masks is meant as a morale builder for the 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of reserve soldiers who, on a moment's notice, might have to be 
mobilized for war, he remarked: "It's best that they have the feeling the masks 
are in their homes and can go to the army feeling (their families) are 
protected." 
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's comments dovetailed with one theory that Iraq would use chemical 
weapons to try to disrupt Israeli mobilization of its land and air forces. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, on the emotional level, the effect on civilians appears to vary 
widely. On one hand, delivering gas masks to men, women and children is meant 
to soothe fears over the threat of chemical death from Iraq. On the other, the 
very fact of handing out the masks and other paraphernalia is an incitement to 
nervousness, emphasizing that there is danger on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, someone hurled a tear-gas grenade at an apartment building in 
Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, setting off a minor panic. Residents believed that 
war was under way and flooded first-aid stations with telephone calls, the 
Jerusalem Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We were watching television. Suddenly, I felt I could not breathe and my 
throat ached," the paper quoted a resident as saying. "My first thought was 
about my kids being suffocated by nerve gas. Stupidly, we ran and opened the 
windows, which only increased the effect of the gas." 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics treated "anxiety attacks," the Post reported. Newspapers here have 
been less than reassuring. The biggest-selling newspapers ran bold headlines 
Sunday declaring that American officials consider an Iraqi attack on Israel "a 
real possibility." 
</P>
<P>
In Kfar Yona, several recipients of the masks expressed belief that Iraq would 
not attack Israel with chemical weapons because of fear of massive retaliation. 
"Iraq would be crazy to attack Israel. Maybe someone here would be killed, but 
the response would destroy Iraq," said Sassi Elia, 25, a student and father of 
a 2-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
Kfar Yona, a bedroom community of 5,000 residents in central Israel, was one of 
three towns selected to receive gas masks during the next three days. The 
distribution at Kfar Yona, Ofaqim in the south and Yokneam in the north is 
meant to test the delivery system before the national program gets under way 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at the town hall here was orderly, considering the numerous 
families with energetic small children who approached to receive the gas masks. 
The residents were notified by mail and were scheduled to pick up the material 
by alphabetical order. 
</P>
<P>
Once they register, the families pick up the equipment from a storeroom and 
then are given a demonstration by a soldier. The lesson is repeated in a movie 
being shown, if not heard above the teen-age din, as well as in a book of 
instructions on sale for $5. 
</P>
<P>
There are masks sized for adults and children, plastic hoods equipped with 
filters for toddlers and incubator-like tents for infants. Some children 
laughed when fitted with masks or special hoods, others wailed in tears. "Today 
my family and I are going to the distribution point to get our masks . . . and 
hope very, very much we will never need them," an Ofaqim resident named Shalom 
told Israeli Army Radio. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-chemical kits also contain syringes of an anti-nerve-gas agent and 
powder to absorb liquid chemicals. Full bodysuits like those used by U.S. 
troops stationed in Saudi Arabia are not available. 
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 masks specially designed to fit over beards were being ordered 
from Germany by a Jerusalem Orthodox Jewish group to accommodate pious Jewish 
men who refuse to cut their beards to conform with the narrower masks made in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, war fever in Israel has swung 
between peaks of high anxiety and low expectations. Early war talk has been 
replaced by the serenity of a series of Jewish holidays and traditional family 
gatherings. News of government scandals and the adventures of a 
motorcycle-riding bank robber have competed with reports from the Persian Gulf 
in Israeli papers. 
</P>
<P>
The metaphorical horror of Jews being the target of poison gas -- a grim if 
indirect parallel of the fate of millions of Jews at the hands of German Nazis 
in World War II -- has received little attention. "There is not a real 
preoccupation," said philosopher David Hartman. "Israelis feel they can defend 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement last week that gas masks would be distributed dried up the 
little tourism from abroad still headed Israel's way since the gulf crisis 
began. Charter flights from Scandinavia to the Red Sea resort of Eilat were 
canceled, and several hotels in Jerusalem have reduced their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
There was some confusion over exactly when gas masks would be provided to the 
1.7 million Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Concern has been voiced that Palestinians would not keep the masks for an 
emergency but would use them instead to defend themselves against tear gas 
during stone-throwing melees characteristic of the Arab uprising in the 
occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Mordechai, who is in charge of military operations in the West Bank, 
said that Palestinians would not get masks unless a conflict with Iraq breaks 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said that the Palestinians in the territories would be 
charged $20 for the masks because the taxes they pay do not cover the costs of 
the devices. Arab citizens of Israel receive the masks free of charge.

POLICY: TWELVE FOREIGN MINISTERS VOW TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE. THEY DIFFER ON 
CREATING A SECURITY ARM WITHIN THEIR ALLIANCE.

<P>
The foreign ministers of the European Community agreed Sunday that there could 
be "no compromise" with Iraq over the U.N. resolutions on the issue of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Asolo, Italy, the senior diplomats of the 12 EC nations 
declared that the pressure must be kept up on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
withdraw his forces from Kuwait, which he invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after the two-day informal meeting 
that pressure must be applied through the continued threat of military force, 
diplomatic isolation and far-reaching economic sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
While the foreign ministers expressed unanimity on maintaining a solid West 
European front against Iraq's aggression, there was a differing view on seeking 
a security component within the EC. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni De Michelis, the foreign minister of Italy, which currently has the EC 
presidency, has called for a new Treaty of Rome, the founding document, which 
might incorporate the growing move toward closer political union. 
</P>
<P>
A December conference has been scheduled to look into ways that a closer 
political union can be established. 
</P>
<P>
De Michelis has also proposed that the EC establish a mechanism that can 
provide a defense structure within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, France and Germany have suggested new concepts under which 
foreign and security policy would be decided by a majority vote, rather than 
the usual "consensus" that governs such major decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, whose decision to add the pound to the exchange rate mechanism of the 
European Monetary System was warmly applauded, threw some cold water on the 
grander plans for an EC joint defense arm. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Hurd said that while the community should take steps to strengthen 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's so-called European pillar, no moves 
should be made that would weaken transatlantic solidarity with the United 
States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"For us," said Hurd, "NATO will remain the prime forum for collective security 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas urged the EC to look at ways in which it 
could strengthen its collective security within the community, declaring that 
it should agree to have a common policy in areas where it had common values and 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas said the current Persian Gulf crisis is an example of an area where the 
EC should have common foreign and defense policies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Britain, France, Italy and Germany, the other EC members are 
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Spain.

Rwandan troops fought with guns and bombs for an eighth day to neutralize rebel 
invaders in the north of their tiny East African country, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Kigali, the capital, said they understand the Rwandan army 
is still meeting stiff opposition from the 2,000-strong rebel army, which 
stormed the country Sept. 30. In Kigali, government forces have arrested 
hundreds of suspected rebel sympathizers, officials said. The invaders, most of 
them from the Tutsi tribe, seek to oust the government, dominated by the rival 
Hutu tribe.

Serbia's ruling Communists suspended talks with the federal government on 
resolving ethnic tensions in Kosovo province, angered that two members of a 
federal delegation had met leaders of the ethnic Albanian majority. "The visit 
of the federal government delegation to Kosovo has been completed as far as I 
and the government of Serbia are concerned," said Serbian Vice President 
Momcilo Trajkovic, who has been overseeing Kosovo since the government of 
Yugoslavia's largest republic assumed direct control of the province on July.

About 500 people protested outside the Soviet Defense Ministry in Moscow 
demanding a volunteer army and alternative military service. Many applauded as 
speakers from the fledgling Radical Party, one of dozens of political 
organizations that have sprouted under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
glasnost (openness) reforms, criticized the United States and the Soviet Union 
for the arms buildups and said the draft is now unnecessary.

BUDGET FIGHT TESTS SPEAKER'S METTLE; 
</P>

POLITICS: THOMAS S. FOLEY HAS BEEN THE ARCHITECT OF CONSENSUS IN THE HOUSE. 
NOW, SOME COLLEAGUES WONDER IF HE IS TOUGH ENOUGH TO HANDLE THE DEFICIT CRISIS.

<P>
He stands out among the 435 members of the House of Representatives -- a 
brainy, undeniably decent man who is liked by almost everyone, Republicans and 
Democrats alike. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rep. Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), after 16 months as Speaker of the House, is 
facing the most serious political test of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning defeat of the bipartisan accord on budget deficit reduction last 
week has placed Foley on the firing line and raised a new question in the 
capital: Can this man really lead? 
</P>
<P>
Foley showed a rare flash of aggressiveness Sunday when he criticized President 
Bush for shutting down federal government services in the face of the budget 
crisis. Still, characteristically, he did not question the President's motives. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was any criticism of the Speaker, it is that he ought to be tougher 
toward the President," liberal Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) said as he emerged 
Sunday from the House Democratic Caucus, where the outlines of a new budget 
proposal were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tom has done an excellent job," Rep. W. G. (Bill) Hefner (D-N.C.), a 
conservative, said as he left the caucus. "I'd just like to see him meaner, but 
that's not his nature. I'd like to see him be more vicious. . . . But that's 
why he's Speaker and I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Foley is clearly under pressure now. It was he who put together -- and 
shepherded for 4 1/2 months -- the negotiations between the White House and 
Congress that produced the plan that his fellow House members rejected last 
week -- in part, they said later, because they believed they had been shut out 
of the process. 
</P>
<P>
In the battle between Congress and the Bush Administration over the weekend, it 
was Foley who spoke for the lawmakers on the TV interview shows. Now it is he 
who must patch things up -- first among Democrats, then between Congress and 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a judge who himself had judicial ambitions early on, 61-year-old 
Thomas Stephen Foley has been a consensus-builder for much of his 26 years in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Foley's passion for consensus and compromise -- and his absence of the 
instinct to go for the jugular -- were cited as just the qualities needed to 
rescue the House from the partisan wrangling into which it had plunged under 
his predecessor, former Rep. Jim Wright (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
Foley, a lawyer, was assistant attorney general of the state of Washington 
before he came to the nation's capital in 1961 as an aide to the late Sen. 
Henry M. (Scoop) Jackson (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, helped by the landslide election of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Foley 
narrowly beat an 11-term Republican congressman to win the right to represent 
his conservative district in eastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He later honored the man he had defeated, Rep. Walt Horan, at a reception. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, Foley reluctantly accepted the nomination of his fellow 
Democrats to replace Rep. W. R. Poage (D-Tex.) as chairman of the House 
Agriculture Committee -- at the time part of a move to limit the authority of 
conservatives who had dominated House committees. 
</P>
<P>
Foley immediately named Poage vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Former Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) brought Foley into the 
House leadership in 1980 by naming him to the third-ranking post of whip. "Tom 
Foley sees three sides to everything," O'Neill said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
When Foley was elected Speaker, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), current 
chairman of the House Budget Committee, hailed the choice as the perfect one to 
help reunify the House. "If there's one man who can repair the damage, it's Tom 
Foley," he said when Foley took the job. 
</P>
<P>
But critics fret that the same traits that have made Foley so effective could 
prove to be liabilities when it comes to resuscitating the budget package. Will 
he now be able to take off the kid gloves and take a more bare-knuckle 
approach? 
</P>
<P>
Still, on Sunday, there was some evidence that Foley may be about to change -- 
to move "left with the (budget) deal," as Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) put it, 
in order to bring more Democrats on board. 
</P>
<P>
How Republicans, who balked at the tax proposals in the first package, might be 
persuaded to go along with a more liberal version remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Foley has made it clear that he has little hope of turning around Rep. Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), the minority whip, who led the opposition to the budget 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that we will get Mr. Gingrich's support for any plan," Foley said 
on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. "I certainly would not make an 
assertion that any plan, any reasonable plan, would have to have Mr. Gingrich's 
support."

SHEIK RASHID; RULER OF DUBAI SINCE 1958

DUBAI, Reuter 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruler of Dubai, Sheik Rashid ibn Said al Maktum, vice president and Prime 
Minister of the United Arab Emirates, has died, Dubai television said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid, born in 1914, became ruler in 1958 and vice president and prime 
minister of the federation when Dubai merged with the six other members of 
the-then Trucial States to form the United Arab Emirates in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
His eldest son and heir, Crown Prince Sheik Maktoum ibn Rashid Maktoum, is one 
of the UAE's two deputy prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Dubai is the UAE's second largest oil producer after Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Rashid assumed effective control of Dubai under British rule long before 
his father, Sheik Said al-Maktoum, died in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
He played a key role in establishing the UAE in 1971 but spent the last nine 
years of his life secluded in his palace, incapacitated by a series of strokes. 
Friends said he was still alert and in touch with the affairs of the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Sheika Latifa, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Sheik Rashid will be buried today, Dubai television said.

About 250 shouting, whistle-blowing protesters marched down the city's main 
street to protest a proposed 86% cut in an AIDS emergency relief bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It means essentially no new money for AIDS programs at all, and it's going to 
affect people's lives," Robert Lowe, a member of ACT UP, told the crowd. 
Carrying banners and signs reading "Silence Death" and "Treatment Life," the 
crowd marched from U.N. Plaza near City Hall up Market Street to the Castro 
District. Demonstrators rallied at Market and Castro streets. Some protesters 
spray-painted slogans and outlines of bodies on the pavement. The protest was 
one of several throughout the country.

A 10-year veteran Monterey County prosecutor, who was involved in a murder 
investigation that may have led to a witness's death, has apparently committed 
suicide, police said. Collier Vale, 39, was found dead in his apartment from a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Vale, recently promoted to assistant district attorney, was the subject of 
media reports stemming from a year-old mix-up that exposed a murder witness to 
retaliation. Sonjii Johnson, 23, of Seaside, was shot to death in the driveway 
of her parents' home in August, 1989. Bradley Hardison, 25, is accused of 
slaying Johnson to silence her so she could not testify against him in another 
case. Before her death, Vale and a police officer inadvertently called another 
woman named "Sonya" Johnson, who spread the word in the Seaside community that 
Sonjii Johnson was the "snitch."

THE KEY TOPICS: WHERE THE CANDIDATES DIFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are excerpts from key topics covered in Sunday night's 
gubernatorial debate in Burbank between Democrat former San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
CHANGE 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: "I think people are disillusioned because government hasn't been 
working. We have to engage in prevention of a kind that is much more cost 
effective and infinitely more humane than the kind of remedial actions that we 
have undertaken in the past. I would much rather prevent drug use than try to 
rehabilitate it. I would much rather prevent crime than punish it." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "I think the question before the electorate is who is best apt to 
provide this change. Is it someone who has been part of the policies . . . or 
someone who is going to chart a new future. You have to get out there and lead. 
I think there's a need for someone who comes in that's fresh, that's new, 
that's a little bit different." 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE TERM LIMITS 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: "I've come to the conclusion I'm going to endorse Proposition 140, the 
term limits, because it may be the only way that we can make basic change in 
Sacramento. This California Legislature had deteriorated markedly. The two 
Democratic leaders . . . have been up there a combined total of over 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "You don't have term limits on lobbyists, you don't have term limits 
on bureaucrats. I agree with President Reagan. I don't think term limits make 
sense. Senator, if you really feel you can't handle (Assembly Speaker) Willie 
Brown and (Senate President Pro Tem) David Roberti, stay in Washington. I'll 
handle them." 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "I favor a cap on spending, absolutely. Sen. Wilson talks about 
special interests and yet Sen. Wilson is the largest recipient of Savings and 
Loan contributions in the United States Congress. He's the second largest in 
contributions from the chemical industry. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: "You can't say we're going to break the grip of special interests and 
not take fat special interest checks and then do so. As far as your CHP 
contribution, Dianne, I am truly shocked that you would be so blind to such a 
gross conflict of interest that you would take $150,000 from a state public 
employee association when you, or as governor, if you were elected, would be in 
a position where you would have to set or approve their salaries." 
</P>
<P>
ATTENDANCE 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: "I have had an excellent attendance record. The votes I have missed, 30 
of them had to do with the appendectomy that I suffered . . . I have been 
involved in those budget negotiations as much as anybody else who is not one of 
the five who sits there in the negotiations. But I think it would be a real 
insult to the people of California to be absent during the debate. Mrs. 
Feinstein would be delighted to have me in Washington. I don't blame her. Then 
she would have the stage to herself." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "I think absenteeism is an important indication of performance . . . 
the senator has the third worst attendance record in the Congress. He hasn't 
returned to Washington since the Senate reconvened . . . I think it's a mistake 
to be here the day before yesterday measuring podiums when the federal 
government has come to a complete halt." 
</P>
<P>
TAXES 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: "I released all of my tax returns . . . I think it's the only way the 
people can have a fair understanding of whether a candidate or an officeholder 
has some personal economic interest that is in conflict with his or her public 
duty. Will you join me as tomorrow I send to you and the press 10 years worth 
of tax returns?" 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "Pete, my husband and I have made available 17 years of tax returns. 
The press has had an opportunity to come in and examine them. I could throw a 
challenge to you as well. No one said anything to you about your spouse's 
property. It's in a blind trust. I think you ought to make those investments 
available." 
</P>
<P>
LOTTERY 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein: "Would you support early childhood education for every youngster in 
the state of California funded by a change in the lottery, to increase the 
share that goes to education from 34% to 50%, just two points over what the 
state of New York's lottery provides to education?" 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: ". . . a part of my program did include exactly the kind of preschool 
education you're taking about. You want to decrease the amount that goes to 
prizes and increase the percentage that goes to education. I would be all for 
that if it worked. (New York) and other states which run lotteries have found 
that if they do not guarantee a certain prize level . . . they do not generate 
greater revenues at all, not for education or anything else."

Trottier made the score 4-4 at 13:08 with a goal from behind the net that went 
in off defenseman Bruce Driver and eluded goalie Chris Terreri. 
</P>
<P>
Jagr, the Penguins' top pick in last summer's draft, got his first NHL goal at 
14:10 when he put in a rebound from close range. Cullen converted Mark Recchi's 
back-hand pass at 14:23 and Trottier finished the scoring burst at 15:35 when 
he knocked in Joey Mullen's pass from behind the net.

Philadelphia 7, Detroit 2 -- Norm Lacombe, Tony Horacek and Craig Berube scored 
in a three-minute span in the second period at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Lacombe tied the game, 2-2, when he deflected Martin Hostak's shot past 
goaltender Tim Cheveldae at 1:28 of the second period. Horacek put Philadelphia 
ahead 27 seconds later when he scored from the slot on a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Berube made the score 4-2 when he flipped a shot past Cheveldae's glove side. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings have surrendered 16 goals in three games. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 4, Chicago 2 -- Pat LaFontaine had a goal and two assists 
and rookie goalie Jeff Hackett stopped 44 shots at Chicago to lead the 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Crossman, LaFontaine and David Volek scored on power plays and Hubie 
McDonough got a short-handed goal. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 3, Toronto 2 -- Joe Murphy scored two power-play goals for the 
defending Stanley Cup-champion Oilers at Edmonton, keeping the Maple Leafs 
winless in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Quebec 2 -- Defenseman Glen Wesley scored one goal and set up two 
others -- including the go-ahead goal by Randy Burridge in the third period -- 
as the Bruins spoiled the Nordiques' home opener.

Who would have thought Stanford had a prayer against Notre Dame Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
After his team's 36-31 upset victory, Green told Bob Burns of the Sacramento 
Bee that as the team's three buses were being escorted to the stadium by a 
police motorcade, he got a hunch. 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "Nothing against the West Coast, but the Midwest cares about 
football. I could smell football in the air. When the sirens were going and we 
were approaching the stadium, I felt like, 'Move over, here comes the Stanford 
damn Cardinal.' I felt like we were important." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the youngest player to win a PGA Seniors Championship? 
</P>
<P>
A banner day: The Asian Games ended Sunday, but not before a gesture of 
solidarity with the Kuwait national team. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Tatal Mansoor of Qatar won his country's first gold medal at the Games 
in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he ran his victory lap around the stadium waving the flag of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Add Asian Games: Samir Said, goalkeeper of the Kuwaiti team, told Lena Sun of 
the Washington Post: "After the (Iraqui) invasion, it was difficult for us to 
know where we are going or what we are doing. . . . We have proved to all the 
world that we are against what is happening in Kuwait. When they raised our 
country's flag in the Asian Games Village, that was the moment we were looking 
for. We put our flag high. That was worth more than 1,000 gold medals." 
</P>
<P>
Do as I say: Baltimore rookie third baseman Leo Gomez, called up in September, 
made three errors in his first 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But Ron Kittle, the Orioles' veteran, offered him consolation and advice. He 
told Gomez: "You know my what my theory is: Drive in more than you let in." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar (Gamble): In the current issue of Inside Sports, the fun-loving "Good 
Doctor" answers a question from "J.W." of Covedale, Ohio. "J.W." asks: "If 
Chris Berman hosted the Academy Awards, how would he introduce the presenters?" 
</P>
<P>
A partial list from the "Doctor": "Al (Cap) Pacino, Raquel (Bob) Welch, Danny 
(Gold) Glover, Sean (Bull) Penn, Sally (Length of the) Field, Dennis (Oil Can) 
Quaid, Tom (Monica) Selleck, Oliver (Hands of) Stone and Martin (Grounder to) 
Short." 
</P>
<P>
Call them "the Chiefs": When it comes to leadership, no team in the National 
Hockey League is better equipped than the Quebec Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, they named Steven Finn captain on the road, Joe Sakic captain at 
home, Mike Hough alternate captain on the road, Guy Lafleur alternate captain 
at home, and Paul Gillis and Michel Petit the alternates for the alternates. 
</P>
<P>
Good neighbor policy: They unveiled a statue of the late Art Rooney, the 
Pittsburgh Steelers' founder, Sunday at Three Rivers Stadium. Some 7,000 
contributors, including a number of Steeler players, gave $371,000 to fund the 
seven-foot statue. But not all of it was used for the Rooney memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The former Steeler owner, known for his generosity and community spirit, surely 
would have approved of an announcement made Sunday: that some of the money 
would be used to clean and landscape the nearby statue of Honus Wagner, the 
Pirates' charter member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
That was quite a show Sunday at Anaheim Stadium, but something was missing. 
Defense. It's questionable whether the Cincinnati Bengals have enough to reach 
the Super Bowl or the Rams enough to make the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Really, it's not too early to start doubting the Rams' playoff chances. They're 
1-3, have given up an average of nearly 28 points and will be on the road two 
of the next three weeks against the formidable Chicago Bears and the 
touchdown-happy Pittsburgh Steelers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' defensive personnel is so lackluster that even Fritz Shurmur, one of 
the best defensive coordinators in the NFL, might not be able to do much with 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams would have been better off Sunday if both teams had heeded referee Jim 
Tunney's announcement after he called a penalty on Cincinnati on the final play 
of regulation time: "The game is over." . . . 
</P>
<P>
If a team ever was due for a breakdown, it was the previously unbeaten and 
nearly mistake-free Raiders in the fourth quarter in Buffalo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That new CBS soap opera "Dark Shadows" continues today with Game 3 of the 
Pittsburgh-Cincinnati series, which starts at 3:18 p.m. EDT at Three Rivers 
Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Boston Manager Joe Morgan is wasting Roger Clemens when he matches him against 
Dave Stewart. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This could be the year that three of the four major pro sports championships 
are won by repeaters -- San Francisco in the NFL, Detroit in the NBA and 
probably Oakland in baseball. . . . Look-alikes: Walt Weiss and Tom Hayden. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox, Coach Terry Donahue and Chancellor Charles Young 
looked foolish arguing the call on the last play of the game against Arizona. 
ABC commentator Dick Vermeil quickly pointed out that Maddox was over the 
scrimmage line when he threw what would have been a touchdown pass -- and the 
videotape replay clearly showed the same thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maddox makes the same mistakes as most redshirt freshman quarterbacks -- and 
does most things a lot better. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'll never understand why coaches call dangerous passes to the flat near the 
end of close games. One of them gave Arizona a game-winning interception 
Saturday and another nearly cost USC its victory over Penn State when a Nittany 
Lion dropped what might have been a TD interception. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A tailback controversy at USC? Just kidding, Larry Smith. But sophomore Mazio 
Royster has all the moves and is bigger than Ricky Ervins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Trojans' greatest accomplishment against Washington State was 
blocking two field goal attempts by Jason Hanson, who is considered the best in 
the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Least useful pieces of equipment at the Coliseum Saturday night were the 
air-conditioning units behind the Washington State bench. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Getting the most out of the least: Stanford tailback Tommy Vardell ran four 
yards for 24 points against Notre Dame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Both Notre Dame and Wisconsin would be better off if Barry Alvarez were still 
the Irish's defensive coordinator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Do you dare make a team with one loss No. 1 this early in the season? I would. 
Michigan seems to be playing the best football. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Florida State, which was ranked second in the nation last week, might be only 
the third-best college football team in the state. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bonehead of the week award goes to Missouri Coach Bob Stull, who should have 
run onto the field and stopped play before Colorado got a chance to run off its 
fifth down. Mizzou would have been awarded the ball -- and the worst Stull 
would have gotten would have been a halfway-to-the goal line penalty from the 
one-yard line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Worst rule in college football is that allowing the defensive team to score 
points on a conversion attempt. LSU did it against Florida, returning a blocked 
kick for two points. Thus, Florida netted four points on its touchdown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who was voted defensive player of the Wyoming-San Diego State game? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maine, a 44-3 loser to Hawaii, should have stayed on the Maine-land. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is the only unbeaten team in the Big Ten. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Allen's Cal State Long Beach 49ers have a longest winning streak of any 
Division I-A school in Southern California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Upset of the weekend: A Dodger employee, publicity director Mike Williams, 
leaving to take a job with the Clippers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: New Laker Coach Mike Dunleavy says A.C. Green will start ahead of 
Sam Perkins at forward. Reaction: The more important question is, who will 
finish the games at forward? . . . Contender Evander Holyfield has bought 
$100,000 worth of tickets for the Oct. 25 heavyweight title fight at the Mirage 
hotel in Las Vegas. Champion Buster Douglas has bought $10,000 worth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'm not all that crazy about the Kings' new mascot. Better, they should have 
gotten a defenseman.

Southwest Conference presidents Sunday enacted the stiffest academic 
requirements for athletes in the league's 76-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, set to take effect next fall pending review by conference lawyers, 
goes beyond the NCAA's standards. It requires recruits and walk-ons to score at 
least 700 on the SAT or 18 on the ACT college entrance exams and to have at 
least a 2.0 high school grade-point average in core classes. Failure to meet 
those requirements upon enrollment would disqualify athletes from competing 
during any remaining years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Current policy requires student-athletes who do not meet both benchmarks to sit 
out for the first year, but allows students three years of athletic eligibility 
if grades improve.

OILER TIMEOUT MAY HAVE SAVED 49ERS; 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE: ONE PLAY AFTER A FUMBLE IS NULLIFIED, MONTANA THROWS THE

24-21.

<P>
An untimely timeout did in the Houston Oilers and helped the unbeaten San 
Francisco 49ers record their NFL-record 12th consecutive road victory. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling the entire game to catch the fast-starting Oilers, Joe Montana 
got the break he needed and threw his third touchdown pass on a 46-yard play to 
John Taylor, giving the 49ers a 24-21 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers improved to 4-0. Houston is 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Montana teamed with Taylor for the winning touchdown on the first play after 
backup quarterback Steve Young came into the game and fumbled. The Oilers' Ray 
Childress recovered, but it was nullified because Houston called time out 
before the play started. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, shaken up on the previous play, returned and threw a short pass to 
Taylor, who broke away from cornerback Cris Dishman at the Oilers' 43-yard line 
and scored with 6:51 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Oiler Coach Jack Pardee said time was called to set up Houston's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"With Young coming in, we weren't sure who else was in the game," Pardee said. 
"We were expecting Young to bootleg for the first down, and we weren't sure of 
our own personnel. It was such a key play we wanted to set it up to get him 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert said the 49ers also considered a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation, it's confusing," Seifert said. "We were going to call a 
time, but we decided to just go ahead and run the play." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's two earlier touchdown passes included one to Taylor on a play that 
covered 78 yards. He also threw six yards to Jerry Rice for a score. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' Roger Craig set an NFL record for receptions in a career by a 
running back with his 494th. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been playing well, and they gave us the opportunity to get 
back in the game," Montana said. "They took up the slack for us. We were 
running plays designed to clear out the middle and get man-to-man coverage. We 
started calling more crossing routes to get the man-to-man matchups." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moon, who scored on a quarterback sneak in the the quarter, completed 
touchdown pass plays of 30 yards to Drew Hill and 18 yards to Haywood Jeffires 
to give the Oilers a 21-14 lead going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been very successful before," Moon said. "Then we didn't execute when 
we had to. The what-ifs and might-have-beens may haunt me for a couple of days, 
but then I have to get ready for Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers narrowed the gap to 21-17 on a 23-yard field goal by Mike Cofer with 
11:36 to play. The kick was set up by Montana passes of 32 and 22 yards to 
Brent Jones. Jones' 22-yarder gave San Francisco a first down at the Oiler 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so close and yet so far," Pardee said. "This was the kind of day we 
expected. We jumped up and got some turnovers, and the offense got the ball 
right away. Usually, 5-6 plays make the difference, and it was probably fewer 
than that today." 
</P>
<P>
Montana quickly erased a 14-7 halftime deficit in the third quarter with the 
78-yard pass-play touchdown to Taylor, who had beaten cornerback Dishman when 
he caught the ball at the 50 and raced down the sideline for the score. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers got the lead back, 21-14, on Moon's pass to Jeffires, who dropped a 
pass at the 49ers' 15 earlier in the drive. Jeffires beat Eric Davis to the end 
zone to atone for his drop. 
</P>
<P>
Montana finished with 318 yards, completing 20 of 28 passes. Taylor caught four 
passes for 132 yards and Rice had six receptions for 78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Moon performed like the star of a highlight film in the first half. His 
one-yard sneak and his 30-yard touchdown pass to Hill, one play after an 
interception, gave the Oilers a 14-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Montana rallied the 49ers with the six-yard, second-quarter touchdown pass to 
Rice in a drive that benefited from instant replay. Montana's 15-yard 
completion to Rice at the nine was ruled incomplete on the field, but reversed 
after a replay showed Rice got both feet inbounds. 
</P>
<P>
Craig caught a five-yard pass from Montana during the drive that gave him the 
NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
Montana's first touchdown pass to Taylor, five minutes into the third quarter, 
tied the score at 14-14.

LIONS' GAGLIANO STARS IN WIN OVER VIKINGS

<P>
It may be hard to believe that Bob Gagliano is a hero, but it's even harder to 
believe that the Minnesota Vikings are 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought Gagliano was the guy they should be going with," Viking Coach 
Jerry Burns said after Gagliano completed 16 of 31 passes for 299 yards and 
three touchdowns as the Detroit Lions beat Minnesota, 34-27, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the guy that put it all together at the end of last year. He can throw 
the ball very well. He took some pretty good hits in there and kept coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Gagliano led the Lions to victories in their final five games of 
1989, Coach Wayne Fontes considers him the team's third-best all-around 
quarterback behind second-year man Rodney Peete and rookie Andre Ware. The only 
reason Gagliano started Sunday was that Peete was injured last week and Fontes 
believes Ware isn't quite ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney has better skills," Fontes said. "The guy with the best touch (Ware) is 
waiting his turn on the bench. (Gagliano) made the plays when he had to." 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano played at Glendale Hoover High, Glendale College and one year at U.S. 
International before transferring to Utah State after USIU dropped football. At 
Utah State in 1980, he passed for 2,365 yards and 20 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano was a 12th-round draft choice in 1981 who was released eight times by 
five different NFL teams. He also bounced around the USFL for two years before 
it folded. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he was a star, as the Lions, in the first half anyway, mysteriously 
made little use of Barry Sanders. He touched the ball only five times -- 
including once on a spectacular 22-yard touchdown catch-and-run that saw him 
fake out three defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (2-3) cut the Vikings' lead to 20-17 in the third quarter on a 
five-yard touchdown pass from Gagliano to Richard Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
After Steve Jordan's fumble was recovered by Detroit's Toby Caston at 
Minnesota's 34-yard line, Eddie Murray -- who missed four field goals in last 
week's 24-21 loss at Green Bay -- made a 23-yarder on the first play of the 
fourth quarter to tie it, 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-yard scoring pass from Gagliano to Terry Greer and a one-yard scoring run 
by Sanders with 4:46 left gave Detroit a 34-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings' Herschel Walker had a two-yard touchdown run with 2:16 left to 
round out the scoring.

SEAHAWKS ADD TO PATRIOTS' TROUBLES, 33-20; 
</P>

Beset by problems on and off the field, the New England Patriots were on the 
verge of earning a temporary respite from their troubles Sunday against the 
Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Seahawks, behind veteran quarterback Dave Krieg and second-year running 
back Derrick Fenner scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns in a span of 24 
seconds to give the Seahawks a 33-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (1-4) had erased a 19-3 deficit and took their only lead in three 
games when Jason Staurovsky kicked a 48-yard field goal with 12:53 left to make 
the score 20-19. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (2-3) won the game when Krieg, an 11-year veteran, and Fenner, who 
leads the NFL with eight touchdowns, transformed Patriot turnovers into 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
An interception by Dwayne Harper at Seattle's 18-yard line set up a 45-yard 
touchdown pass play from Krieg to Jeff Chadwick with 2:37 left. 
</P>
<P>
A fumble recovery by Melvin Jenkins at the New England 21 led to a five-yard 
touchdown run by Fenner 24 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just so frustrating," said New England quarterback Marc Wilson, who has 
not won in seven starts with the Patriots. "We were right there and then 
something happens." 
</P>
<P>
Krieg completed 17 of 25 passes for 254 yards and two touchdowns. Fenner, who 
had three touchdowns in each of his two previous games, led the Seahawks with 
77 yards in 19 carries and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick's touchdown followed Harper's interception that gave Seattle the ball 
with 5:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
One play after Chris Singleton sacked Krieg for an 11-yard loss, Chadwick 
outran backup cornerback Rod McSwain down the left sideline and caught the ball 
at the front corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive game, New England was inept in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle scored on its first four possessions and led, 19-10, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
In the Patriots' previous two games, both routs, Cincinnati scored on its first 
four series and the New York Jets scored on four of their first five. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mental preparation is killing us," Patriot linebacker Chris Singleton 
said. "We're all hustling. We're all running. It's just the mental stuff and 
the mental breakdowns, the missed assignments." 
</P>
<P>
But the Patriots rallied from a 19-3 deficit on Brent Williams' 45-yard fumble 
return for a touchdown 22 seconds before halftime and a 35-yard scoring pass 
from Wilson to Hart Lee Dykes on their first series of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
On the Patriots' first offensive play, John Stephens fumbled and Eugene 
Robinson recovered at the New England 20-yard line. Three plays later, Fenner 
scored on a five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Krieg connected with Tommy Kane on a 20-yard touchdown pass play with 8:51 left 
in the first quarter to give the Seahawks a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Staurovsky then kicked a 53-yard field goal that tied Gino Cappelletti's 1965 
kick for the longest in team history. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Johnson kicked field goals of 19 and 31 yards to give the Seahawks their 
19-3 halftime lead.

DOING THE SALARY-CAP DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At first glance, it was your basic "Oh wow, what another great move by Magic." 
That's the kind of reaction Los Angeles Lakers guard Magic Johnson provokes, 
particularly when he asks if he can give back $100,000 of his salary as he did 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
It allowed the Lakers to maneuver the salary cap enough to acquire Terry Teagle 
and his $600,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it because I want to win," Johnson said. "Of course, that's the most 
important thing." 
</P>
<P>
It is for all the NBA teams. But the move evokes concern that the rich will get 
richer. Michael Jordan deferred $250,000 of his salary and the Chicago Bulls 
just signed Cliff Levingston with money they wouldn't have had otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about two teams capable of winning the championship with two 
players to whom six-figure money is no big deal. In other words, having wealthy 
players allows them to circumvent the cap. Obviously, teams such as the Miami 
Heat and Sacramento Kings don't have players who make the kind of money to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
NBA general counsel and senior vice president Gary Bettman begs to differ, 
emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not getting richer and they're not circumventing the salary cap," 
Bettman said. "This is one player giving up a small portion of his salary to 
help acquire another player. It takes a special team chemistry and a special 
player to do that. (Johnson) loves basketball and he loves to win, that's why 
he did this." 
</P>
<P>
Sure he loves to win. And it's no great sacrifice to give up such a small 
percentage of a nearly $3 million contract for either Johnson or Jordan. 
Endorsements alone double their salary. So what if they defer some money? 
</P>
<P>
But, why should they have that advantage? 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have a problem with that," Sonics president Bob Whitsitt said. 
"The league watches closely so they don't get that money in another way. That's 
what they have to be careful of. If you can do that, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. If it doesn't bother Whitsitt and nobody else has complained, then it 
shouldn't matter. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Of course it should. If the NBA is serious about the cap, it must hold teams to 
it and not allow them to manipulate it to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it will be unfortunate but true that all teams are not created 
equal. 
</P>
<P>
Born to run: Those wild and crazy Denver Nuggets, with Paul Westhead as their 
new coach, are raising a lot of eyebrows. His fullcourt-pressure-for-48-minutes 
philosophy is producing all sorts of reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Even former NBA coach Alex Hannum has a comment on this team that is bent on 
scoring 200 points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the solid pro teams will meet the challenge of this crap-a-doodle with 
ease," Hannum said. "If I had Detroit's personnel and faced Westhead's system, 
I'd screw it up so bad his players wouldn't know which way to turn." 
</P>
<P>
More important, how will the players deal with fullcourt sprinting for 48 
minutes and 82 games? 
</P>
<P>
"Can NBA players survive while playing that style? That is the question," 
Pistons coach Chuck Daly said. "I know I don't have the coaching ability to try 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Meet the press: And speaking of the Pistons, point guard Isiah Thomas already 
has had an altercation with the media. Presumably, it occurred because of his 
alleged involvement with a gambling ring after the 1990 NBA Championship 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
WJBK, the CBS affiliate in Detroit that first reported the story, sent reporter 
Virg Jacques to practice this week. Although Jacques wasn't the reporter who 
broke the story, he said Thomas, who was cleared of any involvement, took it 
out on him. 
</P>
<P>
"First, after practice, he said, 'I want to talk to you,"' Jacques said. "Then 
he said, 'Ah, never mind.' But as he kept walking toward his car, he kept 
staring at me. So I asked him what the problem was and he started choking me. 
Then he threatened to run me over with his car if I didn't get away from him." 
</P>
<P>
Assault and battery charges were filed, but dropped Friday after Thomas 
apologized to the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the champs are shaking and baking. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ralph: Look for the Sacramento Kings to release center Ralph Sampson 
some time in the next week. His knees are shaky and his attitude even more so. 
No longer is he going to tell the Kings when he can practice and when he can't. 
They've had enough of him. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the possibility we're going to play hardball with Ralph," Kings vice 
president Jerry Reynolds said. "It's not going to be a situation like it was in 
the past when the ballplayers are going to dictate to the employer when they 
are going to work." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson, 30, played in just 26 games last season, averaged just 44.5 games over 
the past four years and makes $2.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings have good news regarding the condition of another player. Antoine 
Carr has dropped from 280 pounds to 260 on his 6-foot-9 frame. Kings coach Dick 
Motta is claiming Carr looks like another Karl Malone. He now squats 735 pounds 
and leg presses 925. 
</P>
<P>
"He's undergone the most amazing transformation I've ever seen as a coach," 
Motta said. "If he has it up here (in his head), it will be great." 
</P>
<P>
One more try: Sidney Moncrief, who retired before last season with knee 
problems after a brilliant 10-year career with the Milwaukee Bucks, stunned a 
lot of people when he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks last week. The 
fifth selection of the 1979 draft from Arkansas, Moncrief, 33, was upset when 
the Bucks didn't sign him last season. Now he is willing to give it one more 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not something I've contemplated for a long time," Moncrief said. 
"I've been playing ball steady for two or three weeks. I feel good. I came to 
realize I missed basketball. I retired feeling I could still contribute. I need 
to know for sure if I can play in the NBA again. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's from the heart. My knees will always be a problem. But I think I 
can play through the pain and perform at a high level. I feel confident. I 
guess I'll know in a few weeks if I am kidding myself." 
</P>
<P>
More old folks: Moncrief isn't the only aging star with an uncertain future. 
The Boston Celtics have released Dennis Johnson, 36, and don't want him to 
retire so they can use his entire $1.15 million contract for room under the 
salary cap. If he retires, they only can use half that amount. The Pistons have 
expressed interest. ... And Detroit still hasn't signed Vinnie Johnson, 34, who 
wants a three-year, $3.9 million guaranteed contract. The Pistons will only 
guarantee two of those years. 
</P>
<P>
And some young folks: You won't find a younger starting team in professional 
sports than what the Miami Heat now considers its first five -- Glen Rice, 23; 
Alec Kessler, 23; Rony Seikaly, 25; Willie Burton, 22; and Sherman Douglas, 24. 
And the first three players off the bench are Bimbo Coles, 22; Kevin Edwards, 
25; and Billy Thompson, the old man at 26. ... And if you think 21-year-old 
Chris Jackson was crazy when he turned down $2.5 million a year from the Denver 
Nuggets because 15 percent of it was deferred, listen to the wise words of 
Sonics forward Shawn Kemp, all of 20. "I talked to Chris about that. The next 
contract I get, I don't want anything deferred either. With this economy, 
you're much better off with the cash up front." Who can argue with that logic? 
</P>
<P>
Barking about Bol: The new version of the odd couple is in Philadelphia these 
days, starring Charles Barkley and Manute Bol. Barkley, for one, is not sold on 
the 7-foot-7 Bol's effectiveness on the floor. He is afraid it will cripple the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury is still out," Barkley said. "I'm double-teamed almost every time 
now. But if I get the pass inside to Rick (Mahorn), he can get us two. And if I 
get it outside to Hawk (Hersey Hawkins), he can get us two. But if I throw it 
to Manute, who knows what is going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
But Sixers management knows better than to take Barkley seriously. They think 
trading their 1991 first-round draft choice for Bol was a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"On odd days, Charles doesn't like him," Sixers owner Harold Katz said. "But on 
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he likes him. We do not go to Charles Barkley 
and ask him about a trade. That would be lunacy." 
</P>
<P>
New coach standing Pat: Mike Dunleavy already has gone out on a limb and said 
Vlade Divac will start at center for the Los Angeles Lakers, along with A.C. 
Green, James Worthy, Magic Johnson and Byron Scott. Free agent Sam Perkins will 
come off the bench. But what most people still want to talk about is how 
Dunleavy is dealing with all the questions about replacing Pat Riley as the 
Lakers coach. "There's no adversarial relationship between me and Pat," 
Dunleavy said. "But from everyone there is a feeling that there should be. 
That's the one thing that keeps coming up and I find myself continually 
defending the situation. I tell people how it is and they said, 'Yeah, sure, 
now give me the real story.' "

IT'S A SPECIAL NIGHT FOR THE BILLS' TASKER, WHO GETS GAME BALL; 
</P>
<P>
BUFFALO: HE FORCES A FUMBLE AND LATER HIS BLOCKED PUNT IS RETURNED FOR GO-AHEAD 
TOUCHDOWN.

<P>
After making the Pro Bowl as the AFC's top special teams player in 1987, wide 
receiver Steve Tasker of the Buffalo Bills may be doomed to being a special 
teams specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Bills picked me up off the waiver wire from Houston in 1986 they 
said, 'Listen, we're having some problems on our special teams, can you help us 
out?' And they liked what they saw," Tasker said. 
</P>
<P>
Tasker showed why he's regarded as one of the best special teams players in the 
NFL by setting up two touchdowns, one by forcing a fumble on a punt return, the 
other by blocking a punt as the Bills overcame a 10-point deficit to hand the 
Raiders their first loss of the season, 38-24, Sunday night at Rich Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's special teams captain, Tasker was voted the game ball. Unlike his 
teammates who have thrown balls into the stands after catching touchdown 
passes, Tasker plans to keep his. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first game ball I've ever received and it's going up on my mantle," 
Tasker said. 
</P>
<P>
Tasker set up what turned out to be the winning touchdown when he blocked a 
Jeff Gossett punt, which cornerback J.D. Williams recovered and returned for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bills trailing, 24-21, after James Lofton's 42-yard touchdown 
reception, Buffalo's defense forced the Raiders to punt. Tasker raced through 
to block the kick and Williams scooped it up and went 38 yards for a touchdown 
to give the Bills a 28-24 lead with 6:52 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to block a punt because punt protection is usually the first thing 
you work on in training camp," Tasker said. "Gossett is such a great punter 
that sometimes they could let everyone run free and and he'd still get it off. 
</P>
<P>
"But I took a gamble and cut the corner to get a jump and I came through 
untouched. Had (Gossett) not stepped toward me instead of away from me there's 
no way I would have gotten there." 
</P>
<P>
Gossett, who had never had a punt blocked since joining the Raiders in 1988, 
didn't see Tasker coming around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"The snap was real good and I got it off as fast as I could," Gossett said. "I 
talked to Tasker afterward and he said he took a gamble and cut the corner as 
much as he could and he came through pretty clean. I take pride in being one of 
the fastest guys in the league getting off punts. 
</P>
<P>
"Tasker's probably the best punt-blocker in the league, but we knew that coming 
in and we worked on it all week. He just beat us today." 
</P>
<P>
After blocking four punts in the past five seasons, Tasker has turned 
kick-blocking into an art form. Although the stereotype of a special teams 
player is someone who plays like a kamikaze, Tasker take a scientific approach, 
as befits a Northwestern graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a technique to it," Tasker said. "You see guys jumping up with their 
hands in the air and they'll never block kicks. The key is to take it right off 
the guy's foot because it rises so quickly off a punter's foot that you have to 
be 10 feet tall to jump up and block it." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce DeHaven, Buffalo's special teams coach, said Tasker is the best kick 
blocker in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Albert Lewis (the Kansas City Chiefs' kick-blocking specialist) is pretty 
good, but Steve has had four blocked punts since he's been in the league and 
four blocks doesn't happen by accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to get a block on Jeff Gossett, that's why Steve's 
accomplishment is even greater because nobody has come close to blocking a Jeff 
Gossett punt." 
</P>
<P>
Does Tasker have to sacrifice his body to block kicks? 
</P>
<P>
"That one didn't hurt," Tasker said. "I've had blocks where it leaves a tattoo 
on you for a week. But I caught that one on the tape on my wrist so it 
deflected the bruise." 
</P>
<P>
Tasker also set up the Bills' first touchdown when he forced a fumble by Raider 
punt returner Tim Brown at the Raider 15. Quarterback Jim Kelly, who had been 
unable to move the offense in the first quarter, threw a 13-yard touchdown pass 
to wide receiver Andre Reed just two plays later to tie the score at 7-7 with 
4:09 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I lucked out on that because the punt was over to my side," Tasker said. "If 
the punt had been in the middle of the field I wouldn't have been there. I was 
right in (Brown's) face when he caught it, but I never knew he fumbled it until 
I heard the reaction of the players around me. It was lucky for me that I was 
on that side and unlucky for Tim Brown that I was able to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "I just got hit. At the time the ball got there he got there and I 
didn't have time to put it away." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-string wide receiver on the Bills, who feature extraordinary 
receivers such as Lofton and Reed, Tasker is small (5 feet 9) and slow and 
rarely plays except on special teams. But he accepts his role. 
</P>
<P>
"They shudder to put me in at wide receiver," Tasker said. "I guess I'm doomed 
to playing special teams instead of receiver for the rest of my career here. 
But I like the role. It beats sitting on the bench."

AS USUAL, A'S STEWART IS UNUSUALLY SUPERB; 
</P>
<P>
A'S: OAKLAND PITCHER DOMINATES THE RED SOX AND INVITES ANYBODY TO FIND SOMEONE 
WHO HAS DONE BETTER RECENTLY.

<P>
The facts speak for themselves. If they don't, Dave Stewart spoke with even 
greater clarity. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need Roger Clemens in or out of the game to have a chance to win when 
I'm pitching," Stewart said Saturday night after he and his Oakland Athletics 
proved it again. 
</P>
<P>
The A's routed the Boston Red Sox, 9-1, in Game 1 of the American League 
playoffs as Stewart outlasted the tiring Clemens and gave up only four hits in 
a characteristic eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
The A's ace is 7-1 in confrontations with Clemens, 4-0 for his career in 
playoff competition and 23-11 overall in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristic, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Stew was good tonight, but he's good a high percentage of the time," A's 
pitching coach Dave Duncan said. "It was a Dave Stewart-type game. I mean, if 
he was better in any one area than he normally is I guess it would be that he 
had exceptional control. He was able to go to either side of the plate whenever 
he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stewart, the first pitcher since Jim Palmer (1975-78) to win 20 or more 
games in four consecutive seasons: "This is the way I've pitched the last four 
years. I had everything working. Good fastball. Hard slider. I was able to 
establish the inside part of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, people talk about my playoff record, but I was 5-0 in September before 
losing my last start, 2-0. I've pitched well for a month. I've pitched well for 
four years. You look around at the pitchers in the league, and who else has 
done what I did? Nobody but me. The thing that made this year better than the 
other three is that I had to work so much harder because the opposition was 
more geared to what I was throwing." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but the Red Sox are 0-4 against Stewart this year and 5-12 for his 
career. He gave up a fourth-inning homer by Wade Boggs, struck out three and 
walked one. He retired nine of the last 10 batters he faced before Dennis 
Eckersley pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, making only his second start after going 25 days between appearances 
because of biceps tendinitis, worked six shutout innings. He gave up four hits 
before the relievers turned the game into another Boston massacre, as they 
almost did last Saturday when he returned from his long layoff to pitch six 
shutout innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Red Sox hanging on then for 
a 7-5 win. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has talked about a tension when he and Clemens are in proximity, but 
Saturday night he said: "Each time I pitch against him I have more respect for 
him. I mean, for what he came into the game with tonight, I thought he was 
superb. I don't think he's still 100%. A healthy Clemens goes hard from the 
first inning to the ninth, but I still don't think he would have beaten us, 
1-0. It may not have been 9-1, but I don't think it would have been 1-0." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens was hurt Sept. 4 while pitching against Stewart. Some of the Red Sox 
believe he was overthrowing that day, obsessed with the goal of finally beating 
his nemesis. The Red Sox themselves seemed obsessed with winning Game 1 behind 
their ace. They viewed it as a win they had to have if they are going avoid a 
repeat of the 1988 sweep by Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't put as much emphasis on it as the Red Sox seemed to," Stewart said. 
"I read where they said they had to beat me to win the series. It didn't put 
any pressure on me, but I thought it put too much pressure on Clemens. It was 
as if they were saying, 'We might not be worth a darn in the next three games 
if Roger doesn't beat Stewart.' Heck, I was just trying to keep us in the game, 
pitch my normal game. I mean, I wasn't facing Roger Clemens, I was facing the 
Boston Red Sox hitters." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, disposing of them as he does just about all hitters.

ECKERSLEY HAS GAME 2'S LAST WORD; 
</P>
<P>
ATHLETICS: BULLPEN CLOSER STIRS EMOTIONS WHEN HE STRIKES OUT OLD FRIEND DWIGHT 
EVANS WITH THREE CONSECUTIVE FASTBALLS.

<P>
It was a meeting of friends and former teammates, but when it was over there 
would be a measure of bad blood -- at least on the part of Dwight Evans. 
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth inning of Game 2 of the American League playoffs between the 
Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox. It would become a 4-1 Oakland victory, 
but the lead was only 2-1 when Dennis Eckersley was summoned to face Evans with 
two on for the Red Sox and two out. 
</P>
<P>
"Dewey and I were once so close that he was a member of my wedding party," 
Eckersley would say later. "We're not as close as we once were, but I still 
consider him a friend." 
</P>
<P>
A friend who, at that moment, Eckersley added, represented a pivotal out. "I 
mean, this is our livelihood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The encounter was brief. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley threw three high fastballs -- "high gas," he called it -- and Evans 
swung and missed each, after which, with his adrenaline pumping, Eckersley 
hopped off the mound and pumped his fist, as is his custom. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted it to come down to that, to that situation, and he beat me," 
Evans said with a trace of rancor, "but I don't appreciate being shown up, and 
I can't wait to face him again." 
</P>
<P>
Shown up? The pumping of his fist? 
</P>
<P>
"I meant no offense," Eckersley said. "I was psyched. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't show emotion in the playoffs, when can you? If he hits a home run 
(off me), he can jump up and down all he wants." 
</P>
<P>
Evans did hit a home run off Eckersley last year, a grand slam in Oakland, and 
Eckersley said he couldn't sleep that night. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson hit one of the most memorable home runs in World Series history off 
him in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 1988 Series, and Eckersley didn't 
sleep much that night either. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen closer lives in a do-or-die world of fluctuating emotions. 
Eckersley, his career revived in the bullpen, has been doing it for three years 
but still can't just walk off. Not in the heat of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"It still kills me," he said of the assignment. "Not like it used to, but it 
still eats me up. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Dewey got upset with me last year, too, when I pumped my fist, but 
it's just my emotions exploding. I used to do a lot of silly things, but that's 
over. I'm not purposely showing anyone up." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he would have a right to. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old right-hander has saved 126 of 143 chances since becoming the 
A's closer in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This year, while the lamentable Boston bullpen was saving 44 games, Eckersley 
was saving 48 in 50 chances. It was his best year, one of the best by any 
relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up 41 hits, walked four and allowed five earned runs in 73 1/3 innings 
for an 0.61 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was my best year, but I had a lot more easier saves than I did in 
'88 (when he saved 45 games), so maybe that's why it just looked better," he 
said. "I haven't had many situations like I did in the eighth, so when we got 
the two (runs) in the ninth it really helped." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley worked a flawless home half and has registered eight saves in 11 
playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
He is, of course, one of the significant differences in a playoff that has seen 
the Boston bullpen compile an earned-run average of 15.63, and, as the lastest 
incineration transpired, Eckersley said he sat comfortably in the Boston 
bullpen, gearing up, trying to forget that he still lives in Boston and still 
considers Fenway Park a special place. 
</P>
<P>
"All of that just makes it tougher," he said. "I was trying to stay calm, but I 
knew I'd be facing Dewey and I was pretty pumped up. I just tried to throw as 
hard as I could, and when I do that I usually throw high." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he regarded Evans as the enemy in that situation, Eckersley shook his 
head, saying no, but did say: "I thought he looked nervous up there. I saw he 
was choked up (on the bat). He seemed a little different. Of course, I can say 
that since I struck him out." 
</P>
<P>
Evans shook his head as well when he heard the comments of his friend. "I was 
different at the plate," he said rhetorically. "That's good, real good. Like I 
said before, I can't wait to face him again." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a meeting to stir emotions, something to shake a fist about.

THIN RED SOX BULLPEN PARED AGAIN BY INJURY

Boston's bullpen, already thin, was further weakened when right-hander Dennis 
Lamp suffered a back injury and became unavailable Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lamp was charged with four runs in one-third of an inning Saturday, when Red 
Sox relievers gave up nine runs in the last three innings after Roger Clemens 
had pitched six shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
Injured players can't be replaced on a team's roster during the playoffs, but 
replacements can be made during the World Series. The Red Sox dropped reliever 
Wes Gardner before formulating their 25-man playoff roster, but as Manager Joe 
Morgan said, "How could I know Lamp was going to get hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Hopefully, (Dana) Kiecker will go out and give us six innings. Or 
seven. Or nine." 
</P>
<P>
Kiecker lasted 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said he wasn't not sure whether Clemens will be healthy enough to start 
Game 4 in Oakland Wednesday. "I have to talk to Roger," he said. "If we're down 
0-3, I might wait another day for Roger. You have to get it started, but I 
wouldn't want to start him unless I was sure he's 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland pitching coach Dave Duncan has no qualms about sending Dave Stewart, 
Saturday's winner, out again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made quite a few starts on three days' rest. Any opportunity for him to 
pitch on three days' rest, he wants to," Duncan said. "He just feels like he 
has a better feel for the baseball, better command, on three days' rest. He 
personally feels more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
But that's not true of Bob Welch. "We've used him on three days' rest four 
times, I think," Duncan said. "I think he prefers four, but has responded well 
on three. It's a tribute to the pitchers themselves. We don't have any 
reservations about starting any of our top four starters on three days' rest, 
Dave Stewart, Bob Welch, Mike Moore or Scott Sanderson. Physically, they're all 
capable of it." 
</P>
<P>
But Duncan wasn't sure whether Welch is capable of starting Game 5 on 
Wednesday, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait until (Sunday's) game is over and see what kind of game he 
has," Duncan said. "If he has to throw the kind of game Stew did, a close game 
where he makes 120, 125 pitches, we'll have to see. On top of that, we'll have 
to look where we're at by then." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rigney, the A's senior adviser, on Stewart: "The remarkable thing about 
him is that he wins every big game he pitches. Some guys win some, some win 
one, but he wins them all, and every time it seems like he's pitching against a 
Clemens or (Chuck) Finley or (Dave) Stieb, and he he still finds a way to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will hold workouts at the Oakland Coliseum today, the Red Sox at 2 
p.m. and the A's at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A's Manager Tony La Russa doesn't plan to take attendance today. "Everybody's 
different. Some guys might feel they're going good and want to keep the ball or 
bat in their hands," said La Russa, who said he would probably appear at the 
workout. "Some guys want a day's rest. I don't care. I just want them to be 
ready for Tuesday."

LAID-OFF LOCKHEED WORKERS ARE FORCED TO FACE THE 'REAL WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Lockheed's decision this year to dramatically curtail operations in Burbank is 
bringing an end to a prosperous age for thousands of aerospace workers who 
earned a good living bolting together masterpieces of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Former workers in the secret Lockheed division that built the radar-eluding 
Stealth Fighter are having to learn to look for jobs in what they sardonically 
call "the real world," where stenographers aren't paid $31,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
That realization was evident in the faces of displaced workers recently filing 
into the federally sponsored Verdugo Job Center, which is helping the aerospace 
workers find new careers. The center is located in the once-bustling Machinists 
Union hall on Victory Boulevard in Burbank, where layoffs have shrunk the 11 
union locals to just two, leaving plenty of room for counselors trying to help 
people such as Ted Moss. 
</P>
<P>
Balding and quiet, Moss, 38, carried a plastic bag full of awards, mementos 
from a job well done but no guarantee of a future that will allow him even to 
buy a decent used car for a daughter headed off to college. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dong had a decade of experience in the secret Skunk Works that built the 
Stealth Fighter but needed help deciding what to put on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Ford, 59, fidgeted during her counseling session. Having narrowly 
survived two previous layoffs, she was expecting to be bumped from her 
stenographer's job any day. She summed up the fears about the future that many 
of the workers felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they're trying to give me a heart attack," she said of the 
company's management, laughing nervously. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations in the bars and half-filled luncheonettes near the Lockheed plant 
reflected a growing sense that a special era, when Southern California reigned 
supreme in the aerospace industry, had reached a turning point. "Burbank is 
drying up," said one former employee. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Lockheed Corp.'s restructuring is complete, last year's work force 
of 13,000 will be reduced to as few as 2,000, company spokesman James Ragsdale 
said. A thousand jobs are going to Marietta, Ga., the new headquarters of 
Lockheed's aeronautical systems division, while an unspecified number are being 
transferred to the Palmdale plant, where advanced weapons will be built. Half a 
dozen buildings, housing the administrative offices of the advanced division, 
will be all that is left of Lockheed's 320-acre Burbank plant. 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale blamed the cutbacks on several factors. The company has completed work 
on four major contracts, including the Stealth fighter and the P3 sub-chaser 
that the Navy had been ordering since 1962. At the same time, the defense 
industry as a whole has slowed down dramatically. He said he had heard that 
industrywide, Southern California may lose 20,000 aerospace jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company decided to close the Burbank plant, which had been in 
operation since 1928 and was its oldest. But while the jobs are leaving, most 
of the workers are staying, too old or too settled to pack up and move across 
country. Many were not even offered the chance to move to take new jobs with 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
So those left behind are learning to change their lifestyles and cut back on 
expenses, scrimping and saving on restaurant meals and putting off large 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, of Los Angeles, who made parts for airplanes and missiles for 20 years, 
was laid off Feb. 2. He tried to get a job with competing Northrop Corp. in 
Pico Rivera, but met a job freeze. So for now, he makes do with a $190-a-week 
unemployment check, which doesn't go very far compared to the $617 a week he 
used to make. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to tighten up," he said. "As far as recreation goes, I don't do too 
much of anything. I go to the park because it doesn't cost much, except gas 
money." 
</P>
<P>
He's not a homeowner, so he isn't facing a big monthly mortgage. However, his 
daughter is going off to college to become a lawyer and needs a car. He would 
like to buy one for her but can't do it now. "I told her I want to help her 
out. But I've got to go back to work." 
</P>
<P>
So he went to the Verdugo Job Center looking for tips. 
</P>
<P>
New arrivals at the center, sponsored by the Verdugo Private Industry Council, 
attend a one-day group workshop on modern job-hunting skills that have 
surprisingly little to do with scanning the want ads. "Most people find jobs 
through networking," says George Enoch, manager of the jobs center. The next 
visit is for private counseling and advice on constructing a compelling resume. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was still on the job as a stenographer and she dropped in during a break, 
her ID badge still clipped to her sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be helping you focus on your job wants and develop ways to sell 
yourself convincingly," said her counselor, Bill White. "We're going to video 
you, and at the next session we will develop a reference list." 
</P>
<P>
That taken care of, he wanted to know how she was holding up. "How do you feel? 
Depressed? If you're angry or depressed you can't go out and find a job." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fearful," she said. "I'm not 25 years old anymore. Yet I have to work." 
</P>
<P>
He nods, asks her salary. "I make $14.28 an hour," she replied, sheepishly. "I 
would like to make the same but I'm not convinced I will." 
</P>
<P>
It was a familiar refrain, but White counseled against self-defeating 
attitudes. "What is the magic sentence?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to consider it?" she said hesitantly. 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. "Right. Then you come back here and we'll teach you to negotiate" to 
get more money. 
</P>
<P>
White said later that Ford, who felt her layoff was imminent, was typical of 
displaced workers. "They go through the whole grief cycle. Anger and shock, 
denial, depression, then acceptance." The counselors watch for any worker that 
is too upset and, if so, steer him or her to a therapist. 
</P>
<P>
While union activists say they are still trying to persuade the company to 
stay, Braxton Berkley, one of those on the International Assn. of Machinists 
Committee to Save Jobs, is one of many Lockheed workers who have taken 
lower-paying jobs with Continental Air Lines. "A lot of people from Lockheed 
are out there now. The problem there is, you can't go to work for $9 an hour 
once you made $14," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If there are stages in the healing process, Darlene New, 43, is still in the 
anger phase. She is angry at Lockheed and at her supervisors for letting her 
go. And for the way it was done. On June 29, she was publicly called into the 
manager's office and informed that she would be leaving her $39,000-a-year job 
in Advanced Development Projects, she said. She burst into tears of 
humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been laid off from any job," she said. "You feel, 'Oh, God, didn't 
I do the job well?' " 
</P>
<P>
It was especially devastating because she was not at all prepared for it. 
Having had a top-secret clearance, she was sure she would survive any layoffs. 
"I thought I would be at Lockheed for the rest of my life. It is like part of 
you is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Though her husband also works at Lockheed, the family needed her paycheck to 
help pay the mortgage on their 2 1/2-acre ranch in quiet Leona Valley near 
Palmdale. So instead of filing for unemployment, she went right out and found a 
job selling BMWs in Lancaster. It wasn't a good time, or place, to sell 
high-priced, sporty cars. In a month, she sold only two cars and quit. 
</P>
<P>
The family has withdrawn money from savings to pay bills and the money her two 
sons earned by selling their 4-H animals at the Antelope Valley Fair was used 
to buy school clothes. New recently found a second job that pays 40% less than 
what she made at Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
She was disappointed by the lower wage but realized that she had had it pretty 
good for a long time. "We were all overpaid, I feel. Out in what we now call 
the real world, people don't make that kind of money."

CONTROLLING RUDE, ROWDY FOOTBALL FANS; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A SECURITY NIGHTMARE, SAY POLICE OFFICERS AT STADIUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Lt. Alan B. Kerstein had taken a day off from his usual 
duties at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when the unthinkable happened and 
stadium security completely collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The calamitous event did not occur during a heavy-metal rock concert or an 
international soccer match. It was a Los Angeles Raiders football game. 
</P>
<P>
As the clock ticked down on the Raiders' 1984 AFC championship victory over the 
Seattle Seahawks, police and private security officers "lost" the playing field 
to an onslaught of several thousand celebrating fans. 
</P>
<P>
Petite Raiderette cheerleaders and 275-pound linemen scrambled for safety while 
police officers launched several unsuccessful baton-wielding sorties against 
the unruly fans. Reinforcements, including 10 officers on horseback -- a 
cavalry charge of sorts -- finally succeeded in restoring order. 
</P>
<P>
For Kerstein, who has policed Coliseum events since 1973, the crowd surge was a 
grim reminder that controlling fans at professional football games is perhaps 
the toughest challenge he and other stadium security officials face. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials who monitor crowd safety at the Coliseum, at Anaheim Stadium 
and at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego agree that keeping the peace at a 
baseball game or even a tractor pull is child's play compared to Sunday 
afternoon pro football. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the opera, it's the NFL," observed Kerstein, who supervises Los 
Angeles police officers at Coliseum events. "You can't expect people to just 
sit there and politely clap and say 'jolly good, jolly good.' " 
</P>
<P>
How to prevent the most violent incidents at football games has become a 
subject of debate since the beating of a 35-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers 
supporter during a Raiders game last month. The man was briefly in a coma as 
the result of his injuries, but has since been released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was not the first time a fan had been injured at a Raiders game, 
the severity of the beating led to calls for beefed-up security at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Some have advocated a ban on the sale of beer at the stadium, arguing that 
drunken fans are responsible for the rowdiest behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Coliseum officials announced they would no longer sell beer in 
20-ounce cups, opting instead for 16-ounce containers. The Coliseum Commission 
is now considering implementing a temporary ban on beer sales at Raiders games 
as part of a plan to reduce stadium violence. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 16,000 to 26,000 cups of beer are sold at Raiders games. 
</P>
<P>
While police officials agree that drunkenness is a major contributor to stadium 
violence during football games, they disagree on whether banning alcohol sales 
would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that our most frequent contacts are with people who have had too 
much to drink," said San Diego Police Lt. Bill Skinner, who is responsible for 
security at Jack Murphy Stadium. "But I can't say the problems are caused by 
people who buy beer inside the stadium. There's tailgate parties in the parking 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
For Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim Flammini, who supervises security at Anaheim 
Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Rams, the problems are linked to the nature of 
professional football itself. 
</P>
<P>
When 80,000 people of various temperaments and income levels pack a stadium to 
watch grown men beat each other into the ground for three hours, he said, a few 
slugfests in the stands are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in an environment that is very high in emotions," Flammini said. 
"Professional football is a rough-and-tumble contact sport. It seems to have a 
way of exciting people. . . . If someone says the wrong thing at the wrong 
time, (other fans) might want to defend their team, either verbally or 
sometimes with their fists." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Flammini said, California Angels baseball games are relatively 
placid events. 
</P>
<P>
"The baseball behavior has been fantastic," Flammini said. "We've had very few 
incidents as compared to last year." 
</P>
<P>
For police officials, the best defense against ugly incidents at football games 
is to teach officers basic crowd-control strategies and the elements of mass 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coliseum, Lt. Kerstein commands about 80 to 100 Los Angeles police 
officers for most events, although the number of assigned officers has 
increased significantly for Raiders games after last month's incident. 
</P>
<P>
Kerstein said his officers play close attention to sections 1 through 4 and 26 
through 29 because those seats are sold to fans who do not have season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Season ticket holders tend to be much more focused on the game and less 
aggressive," Kerstein said. "For every one fight I'll have within the confines 
of the season ticket area, I'll have 25 or 50 fights outside of those areas." 
</P>
<P>
Another fundamental rule Kerstein teaches his officers is that they should 
avoid plunging alone into the stands to break up a fight. Instead, he said, 
they should work in teams of six. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, four officers break up the fight itself, separating troublemakers as 
quickly as possible from the rest of the crowd in "commando-like strikes," 
Kerstein said. All the while, two other officers guard the rear to ensure the 
officers are not hit from behind by fans throwing bottles or other objects. 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the unruly fans are then handcuffed in the relative safety of the 
stadium tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go too far into the crowd alone because it really presents an 
officer-safety issue," Kerstein said. "Sometimes I've had to go in alone 
because of the situation. . . . There's been times I've been knocked on my 
butt. It comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the near-riot that occured when the Raiders beat the Seahawks and the 
fans converged on the field in 1984, the worst day Kerstein can remember was in 
1988, when the Raiders played host to the Rams, who won the game 22-17. 
</P>
<P>
"If sections 1 through 15 had been all Raiders fans and 15 to 31 had been all 
Rams fans, I could have done the whole thing with five cops -- piece of cake," 
Kerstein said. "Unfortunately, every other seat was a Ram fan and the next one 
was a Raider fan. They started fighting 30 minutes before kickoff and were 
fighting an hour after the game ended. It was our worst game." 
</P>
<P>
The situation was also becoming ugly on Sept. 23, when the Pittsburgh Steelers 
fan was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Kerstein said that just moments before the incident, he had called for officers 
deployed outside the stadium to help reinforce security in the stands. Several 
fights had erupted throughout the stadium -- they were small "spot fires" that 
could have become a full-fledged conflagration if action wasn't taken. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting very agitated," he said. "We had a number of problems and a 
number of ejections. A couple of people threw bottles. That's just deadly. That 
could kill an officer." 
</P>
<P>
Officers who work in the Coliseum said flying bottles are only one of the 
problems they face patrolling the stands during Raiders games. 
</P>
<P>
They complain of fans who make them the butt of derisive jokes and who openly 
insult them when they break up fights. When their backs are turned, fans pelt 
them with cups, paper airplanes and other items. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels I'm like a walking target for every half-empty glass of beer," said 
one youngish-looking officer who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
His partner, a 10-year veteran, added: "It's like letting all the animals loose 
inside a cage and walking in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STADIUMS: ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND ARRESTS 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between fan violence and alcohol sales at Southern California 
stadiums has been a subject of debate since the Sept. 23 incident in which a 
Pittsburgh Steelers fan was severely beaten while cheering his team at the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Following are figures comparing alcohol consumption 
by fans and arrest rates at four major Southern California stadiums. Police 
officials note that different arrest policies at each stadium have an impact on 
the number of arrests.

12 KILLED -- 6 IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS -- ON WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 12 people were killed in weekend violence in the Los Angeles area, six 
in unrelated drive-by shootings, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, four pedestrians were struck by bullets fired indiscriminately 
from a passing car about six blocks from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. David Young said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men, a 22-year-old whose name was not released pending notification 
of relatives, died at 1 a.m. Sunday. The three other men were in stable 
condition at area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"As best as we can tell (the gunman) just started opening fire . . . shooting 
at anyone who was there," Young said of the shooting near 39th Street and 
Normandie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As with the other drive-by shootings, there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of other weekend violence was a 16-year-old Palmdale boy who 
died Saturday after he held a gun to his head and pulled the trigger, thinking 
it was unloaded, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Sanders died instantly from a single shot to the head from the .44-magnum 
revolver, the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said the boy took the gun, which belongs 
to his mother's boyfriend, from his house about 10:30 p.m. He pointed it 
playfully at two friends and ordered them not to move before placing the barrel 
to his temple and firing, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend left the gun out because he planned to go hunting Sunday morning, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a sheriff's deputy shot at -- but missed -- a man who 
allegedly was firing his semiautomatic pistol into homes in his Florence-area 
neighborhood early Sunday. The suspect, Ballentine Gonzalez, 26, was arrested 
after a short struggle and was being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old boy was stabbed and found bleeding to death in a driveway in the 
11200 block of El Rey Drive in Whittier, police said Sunday. The boy was 
believed to have been stabbed in a fight about two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
In the other drive-by killings reported by authorities: 
</P>
<P>
* An unidentified 19-year-old was slain in front of a taco stand in East Los 
Angeles about 2 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* Jose Rodriguez, a 20-year-old suspected gang member, was struck and killed as 
he partied about 12:15 a.m. Sunday in the street in the Cypress Park area east 
of downtown. Party-goers, including gang members, were "very uncooperative 
witnesses," and did not provide a description of the gunman's car, Detective 
Ron Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
* Edward Jaquez, 25, of San Pedro was killed as he stepped into the street in 
the 1000 block of South Center Street about 11:35 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
* Also Saturday night, two men were hit by gunfire in South Los Angeles as they 
stood in front of a coin laundry at 7601 S. Vermont Ave. Delbert Bain, 29, who 
was shot in the back, died at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, while the 
second victim was in serious condition with a jaw wound. 
</P>
<P>
* Danny Hurtado, 17, of Pomona, was killed late Friday when a passing gunman 
fired three shotgun volleys at him as he walked on East Grand Avenue in that 
city.

LEFT-HANDEDNESS SEED IN WOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times Wire and Staff Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of thumb-sucking among fetuses shows the tendency to be left-handed may 
start in the womb, Irish researchers reported last week in the British journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the adult population is left-handed, and scientists have long 
debated whether that preference stems from genetic factors or is caused by some 
kind of injury, perhaps occurring during birth. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the researchers said they have found evidence some fetuses display a 
preference for sucking their left thumbs as early as 15 weeks after conception. 
</P>
<P>
Using ultrasound to examine the fetuses of 224 women who had normal 
pregnancies, the researchers found 12 of the 224 fetuses -- or about 5.4% -- 
favored their left thumb. The positions of the fetus in the womb had no effect 
on thumb preference. 
</P>
<P>
Follow-up observations of 17 fetuses indicated "preference for a particular 
thumb is maintained during pregnancy," the researchers said. The discovery, 
they said, "demonstrates for the first time the existence of behavioral 
asymmetries before birth" and "supports genetic explanations of handedness."

A NEW TWIST ON ECO-BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Tukel and Joshua Horwitz, environmental publishers, weren't upset when 
they saw the unprecedented deluge of eco-books pouring off the nation's presses 
last spring for Earth Day '90. They weren't worried about the competition, even 
though their own books were still waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling was the more books the better," Tukel said. "We're doing something 
different. We're in it for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
They've just caught up with the parade, having launched Living Planet Press 
with two action-oriented paperbacks for fall: "The Animal Rights Handbook: 
Everyday Ways to Save Animal Lives" and "The Rainforest Book: How You Can Save 
the World's Rainforests." 
</P>
<P>
Does the world need more green books? 
</P>
<P>
Tukel and Horwitz think so. Working out of an airy, multilevel loft complex in 
Venice, the two longtime friends are channeling their social consciousness into 
a new publishing niche, and collaborating with major environmental groups who 
will mass-market books to their members. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an alternative pipeline," explains Tukel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Animal Rights Handbook" will be given as a gift to renewing members by the 
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), which bought 
50,000 copies to help celebrate its 125th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rainforest Book" was published in collaboration with the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, which bought 50,000 copies to sell to members, plus 70,000 
more copies of a pocket-sized version to be distributed free to build support 
for their rain forest rescue campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Tukel and Horwitz maintained creative control over the books. 
</P>
<P>
"Our books are ideas," said Horwitz. "We're producing them, not just publishing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Their work "symbolizes a new populist era in environmental books, which 
traditionally have been rather lofty," said Charlie Winton, president of 
Publishers Group West, the country's leading distributor for independent 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
"Their books are very solid editorially, they look sharp, their price is 
accessible and they tell people, 'You can make a difference.' Ultimately, they 
show there are a lot of people out there who care." 
</P>
<P>
Living Planet Press entered the book world in September with an initial press 
run of 250,000 copies of its two books, of which 100,000 copies were already 
sold. As a result, Tukel and Horwitz, who self-financed the business on a 
shoestring, are already in the black. 
</P>
<P>
But they don't talk like businessmen. They see themselves as turning 
environmental concerns into action; they want their readers to do the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get into this business for the purpose of selling books in 
bookstores," said Tukel. "Our commitment is not just to publish books but to 
see that they are widely distributed and widely read. Our hope is that these 
books are going to spur people to take action on issues which might have 
intimidated them before." 
</P>
<P>
Said Horwitz: "We want to empower people with information. These books combine 
the latest in scientific knowledge with aggressive public education." 
</P>
<P>
That there aren't many alternative presses in Los Angeles doesn't bother them 
because they think of themselves of breaking the rules. "I think we are able to 
do things that most publishers can't," Tukel said. 
</P>
<P>
Working with an administrative staff of five and a handful of computers in a 
Venice neighborhood, they boast of moving a project from idea to bookstore in 
six to seven months. 
</P>
<P>
The books are collaborations. "We tend to initiate the project," Tukel said. 
"We want enough editorial control to shape the first draft, do the cover. We 
come up with the ideas, come up with the issues, match it with a major group 
that can promote it, and farm out the work to writers and artists." 
</P>
<P>
Both 35, they are relative newcomers to the West Coast, having moved their 
environmental consulting partnership from New York to San Francisco three years 
ago when Horwitz's wife, Ericka Markman, an educational media distributor, 
entered Stanford business school. They incorporated Living Planet Press in 
January and moved to Los Angeles in June, attracted by the environmental 
urgency here. 
</P>
<P>
"I like extreme situations and I think Los Angeles is an exciting place to be," 
Tukel said. "It's compelling, because there is no escape and I think everyone 
is aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
He sees the city as providing a prototype for the future of Western industrial 
culture. The scenario is like a movie script, he said: "Let's take 10 million 
people and put them in this desert basin and add 10 million cars that burn gas 
and, for fun, let's cut off their water supply and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
The outcome is still to be written, he thinks: "Either people will grapple with 
the situation or the city will die. I think 100 years from now, people will 
look back and see the '90s as the last chance to get off these 
resource-consumptive highways we've been traveling on." 
</P>
<P>
Tukel, a graduate of Haverford College in Pennsylvania, was an early recruit to 
environmental causes. Having gone West in 1978 to study economics at the 
University of Wisconsin, he dropped out of graduate school to join the 
environmental battle in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where Union Carbide's 
plans to mine uranium were fought by the Sioux nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a formative experience for me," said Tukel, who spent the next year as 
a community organizer. "There is probably no more frightening reality than 
uranium mining in your back yard, and the Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux 
religion. The lines were drawn. In war terms, it was a full-scale assault on 
the Black Hills without the consent of the people who had lived there for 
thousands of years. It really harkens to the present and the situation in rain 
forests." 
</P>
<P>
Tukel spent the '80s doing direct-mail marketing for public interest groups, 
including the Native American Rights Fund, the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, Human Rights Watch and others. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, he and Horwitz (who met as teen-agers picking peaches on 
a trip to an Israeli kibbutz) have worked together as writers and consultants 
for nonprofit groups, creating direct-mail marketing packages. 
</P>
<P>
Horwitz, a writer, grew up in Washington, D.C., and attended a Quaker high 
school, then Princeton, then New York University film school. Although he has 
published five children's books and written screenplays, his writing career was 
"not particularly successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the environmental world via direct mail, but gradually grew 
interested in the issues he was writing about: "You have to be an expert to 
reduce a complex issue to a four-page newsletter. . . . I learned about 
everything from air and water issues to land use." 
</P>
<P>
The marketplace was equally intriguing to a struggling writer whose publisher 
talked in terms of 5,000 books. Horwitz would write a direct-mail piece on 
"Pesticides on Children's Food" or on "Saving Elephants" and the NRDC would 
mail 500,000 copies. Even with the throwaway factor, he learned, that meant at 
least 50,000 readers. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the potential marketing power posed by environmental groups' 
membership lists, Tukel and Horwitz saw a way to convert their direct-mail 
experience to mass market books. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving the environmental groups something to put in people's hands," 
Horwitz said. "People might throw away junk mail, but they don't throw away 
books." 
</P>
<P>
For their first project, they drafted the "Animal Rights Handbook" and took the 
idea to the ASPCA, which was gearing up for its 125th anniversary. "We think 
there is a huge mainstream market for animal rights," said Horwitz. "This is a 
great example of a movement that has been branded as extreme and shrill-toned, 
and we thought the time was right to take it to the masses." 
</P>
<P>
The ASPCA, was receptive. "They met a need for us," said Steve Zawistowski, 
vice president and science adviser. "We had 25 or 30 different flyers on 
various subjects and when people called in with questions we would pluck a 
bunch out of the rack and mail them, but it still didn't give a context." 
</P>
<P>
The "Animal Rights Handbook" offers a step-by-step entry into animal rights' 
concerns, Zawistowski said. It takes basic information about fur ranching, 
product testing, factory farming and other animal-rights issues and ties them 
together with the philosophy of animal rights. 
</P>
<P>
The ASPCA is giving the book a big national push, he said: "It's designed so 
anyone can pick it up and read it and see how their lives can adapt to animal 
rights. And it gave us the opportunity to take on the task that we might not 
otherwise. The whole fearsome process of trying to find a printer and a 
publisher when you're dealing with 800 things. We'd probably just put it on the 
back burner." 
</P>
<P>
"The Rainforest Book," written by Scott Lewis, is getting equally high marks 
from its partners at the Natural Resources Defense Council. They like its 
fact-packed overview chapters and emphasis on personal action. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to reach as many people as possible" said Linda Lopez, NRDC 
director of public education. "People have heard about the rain forest, they 
know there is a problem, but they don't have any idea what to do about it. . . 
. This is a chance to really educate people." 
</P>
<P>
NRDC, with a staff of more than 80 scientists, lawyers and environmentalists, 
has led successful fights to reduce lead in gasoline and eliminate 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in aerosols and Alar in apples. For 20 years, they 
have worked mostly slowly and quietly through legal channels, Lopez said, but 
when they published the 1989 book "For Our Kid's Sake: How to Protect Your 
Child Against Pesticides in Food," it helped galvanize parents to get the 
pesticide Alar taken off the market in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"The book was effective, but we could have sold more," she said. "We didn't 
know how to market it. We didn't know how to advertise it, we didn't have any 
distribution system." 
</P>
<P>
Living Planet will distribute the package, which includes books, a coloring 
book, audiotape and T-shirts to bookstores, museums and zoos, and "we don't 
have to do any of that, and the book gets across the message," Lopez said. "We 
are thrilled and we didn't have to hire any other staff." 
</P>
<P>
That's the sort of partnership Tukel and Horwitz envision. Living Planet Press 
is now working up a spring list of six titles, including "Saving Our Ancient 
Forests" with the Wilderness Society, and "Safe Food" with NRDC. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see these books become fixtures in the public debate," Tukel 
said. "We have hitched our wagon to the environmental movement."

YOU CALL THIS ARCHITECTURE?; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S A CRYING NEED FOR NEW THINKING AND NAME FOR LATEST TREND: TRY 
HOKEYTECTURE

<P>
C'mon, now, is this a joke? people are asking. 
</P>
<P>
Are reputable architects serious when they design a corporate headquarters in 
Burbank with a roof supported by the Seven Dwarfs? 
</P>
<P>
Are designers laughing up their sleeves when they create an instant, 
mock-European street, "Via Rodeo," complete with cobblestones and 
fake-historical facades in the middle of Beverly Hills? 
</P>
<P>
Has fakery become the latest architectural fad nationwide, and especially in 
Southern California? Is the laugh on us? And seriously, how do we evaluate -- 
by the usual standards by which architecture is judged -- whether buildings are 
good or bad? 
</P>
<P>
"When image replaces substance, when design is reduced to decoration, 
architecture becomes a stage set," says Arthur Golding, a USC architecture 
professor. "Only the image matters in the current marketing of retail shops, 
hotels and restaurants as theater. It has led from theme interiors to theme 
buildings and theme districts." 
</P>
<P>
But Golding has it wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake he makes is to apply the appellation architecture to such Seven 
Dwarfed-creations as Disney's new Burbank building. 
</P>
<P>
We need a new classification, a term that acknowledges the motivation and 
intention of such designs. 
</P>
<P>
Call it hokey-tecture. 
</P>
<P>
Hokey is used here, as defined by the Random House dictionary as "obviously 
contrived, especially to win popular appeal or support," rather than in the 
derogatory sense of outright phoniness. 
</P>
<P>
Hokeytecture -- let's drop the hyphen, too, shall we? -- has its own criteria: 
</P>
<P>
* Like Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty's Castle, it always has a theme, an obvious 
visual narrative or "script" that dominates the design, overriding any purely 
formal aesthetic concept. 
</P>
<P>
* The images it projects are always secondhand, drawn from movies or television 
or mass-media memories of a nostalgically better or more graceful past. 
</P>
<P>
* Not only are its images secondhand, they are never transformed by the 
designer's imagination -- unlike populist imageries freshly reimagined by 
serious architects such as Frank Gehry, or the often ironic use of historic 
references in the Post Modern style. 
</P>
<P>
* Its construction materials are often cheap imitations of classier finishes it 
can't or won't afford. 
</P>
<P>
* It is never ironic, seldom means to be serious and displays its essential 
hokery upfront. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these criteria are graphically explained by Disney chairman Michael 
Eisner, the Lorenzo de Medici of hokeytecture, who having commissioned some of 
the world's best architects for hokeytecture unrivaled anywhere, is well 
qualified to explain the style's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all an illusion," he said in a recent interview published in Metropolitan 
Home magazine. "My ethic -- and I learned this in the movie business -- is that 
. . . if you're on a Disney ride, and the car stops moving, and the lights come 
on, you see the seams." 
</P>
<P>
Eisner admits that his magic is not seamless: "You use wood where people can 
really see it. Where they can't, you use something that looks like wood, but 
costs less. Michael Graves' hotels at Disney World (in Orlando, Fla.) are done 
with paint." 
</P>
<P>
Graves, a Princeton-based architect, designed Disney World's themed Swan and 
Dolphin hotels, topping each with outsize fiberglass figures of the animals 
after which they are named. He also designed the Seven Dwarfs building in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Eisner has had no trouble recruiting major talents such as Graves, Frank Gehry, 
Robert Stern, Antoine Predock, Arata Isozaki and others to his hokeytecture 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, every architect in America dreamed of building office towers for 
enlightened developers," said New York design critic Suzanne Stephens. "Today 
they want to work for Michael Eisner." 
</P>
<P>
His only problem, Eisner said, is that these architects "say yes to me too 
much. I keep trying to get them to tell me when I'm wrong, when I'm stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Graves claimed that working for Eisner has "made me more lighthearted, less 
pompous. The Disney projects are a lot of fun, and architecture needs fun if it 
isn't to get too portentous." 
</P>
<P>
But some Disney designers have more trouble adapting to the hokeytecture mode. 
</P>
<P>
Predock, an Albuquerque, N.M.-based designer who has created a Santa Fe-style 
motel complete with a phony drive-in for Eisner's giant Euro Disney project 
outside Paris, said that working for Disney is "a kind of guerrilla theater. 
You make hit-and-run forays into the arena to defend architecture, and retreat 
with commands that can crush you." 
</P>
<P>
This comment reveals that Predock is making Prof. Golding's error of 
classification in applying architecture's criteria to hokeytecture. 
</P>
<P>
No such confusion, however, troubles New York architect Robert Stern. Acclaimed 
by Eisner as "almost an Imagineer" (a member of the Disney in-house design team 
that creates the theme park extravaganzas), Stern said in a 1989 symposium at 
UC Irvine that "hokeyness is OK, so long as it says what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Does all this mean that good architects have sold out? That, in Prof. Golding's 
complaint, designers have "abandoned the public realm to scenography?" 
</P>
<P>
No. Architect Charles Moore, one of the subtlest minds on the current design 
scene, has a clear take on the uses of hokeytecture in contemporary culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt Disney gave us the Theme Park, the multilayered parfait of civic 
realities . . ." he wrote in his book, "The City Observed: Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"He replaced the downtowns, civic amenities, public parks . . . with a made-up, 
hoked-up, highly energized and extremely attractive Magic Kingdom . . . and it 
does not stretch credulity very far to see Southern California's rather 
ephemeral public realm as a concentration of Theme Parks," Moore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, theme or "programmatic" architecture has a long history in Los 
Angeles. The city boasts, among other delights: 
</P>
<P>
* A Coca-Cola bottling plant modeled after an ocean liner. 
</P>
<P>
* A former tire factory designed to look like an Assyrian fortress. 
</P>
<P>
* An airport restaurant resembling a sci-fi spider. 
</P>
<P>
* And a hot dog stand shaped like an outsize frankfurter in a bun. 
</P>
<P>
Moore -- who, oddly enough, has not yet been called upon by Eisner -- captures 
the essence of Disneyland's Main Street, and the impulse behind all 
hokeytecture, when he says that, "in the manner of a family album of smiling 
snapshots, Main Street recalls a cheerful and altogether cleaned-up past, one 
that is eternally freshly painted, blooming, tidy and sunny." 
</P>
<P>
In the society of strangers that cities such as Los Angeles have become, where 
a sense of community is disturbingly tenuous, the only shared images are the 
ones from the "family album of smiling snapshots" offered by movies and TV -- 
and skillfully recreated by popular theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
The huge, new residential and commercial development planned for Playa Vista 
beside Marina del Rey, for example, is derived from a hokeytectural notion of 
pre-World War II small-town American life. Based on the ideas of Miami-based 
architects Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, who built the Gulf Coast 
resort town of Seaside (complete with white picket fences, sloping tin roofs 
and clapboard siding), Playa Vista hopes to conjure a lost sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
"What the American city needs is to encode for different social environments," 
Duany said. Streets and buildings must be "derived from existing types we have 
seen work, types which are generic" to popular memory of a suburban serenity 
more imagined than actual. 
</P>
<P>
Playa Vista's designers understand that Americans live in "Happy Days," share 
the comforts of "The Cosby Show," inhabit the upscale Angst of 
"thirtysomething" and delight in the degeneracies of "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
This is the crux of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hokeytecture imagery is our community. And that is its attraction and power. 
</P>
<P>
So long as we understand its intentions, and refrain from confusing it with 
formal architecture, it has a valid place in the urban scenario. 
</P>
<P>
And it can be fun.

ALEXANDRA: THE PRINCESS AND THE PEDIGREE; 
</P>
<P>
ROYALTY: SOUTHLAND WILL GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE MOST POPULAR AND ACCESSIBLE 
MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When she was a child, she liked to turn cartwheels and be called Sandra. Her 
ambition was to be a circus bareback rider. 
</P>
<P>
She did become an accomplished horsewoman, but these days, don't call her 
anything but "your royal highness." Because Alexandra Helen Olga Christabel, 
Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, Hon. Lady Ogilvy, GCVO, has a richer 
royal pedigree than the Queen of England. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra arrives in Southern California this week to lend the 
British Royal Family's presence to the Festival of Britain in Orange County, 
residents will get a look at not only the queen's first -- and favorite -- 
first cousin, but a descendant of King George V, King Edward VII, Queen 
Victoria, King George I of Greece, King Christian IX of Denmark and the 
ill-fated Czar Alexander II of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is unknown to most Americans, in Britain, Alexandra is the most 
popular and accessible of the royals. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her adult life she has taken on the role of what has come to be 
known as the "professional princess," representing Britain and the Royal Family 
at official engagements at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
She wears the royal mantle lightly, however. 
</P>
<P>
She is " . . . a woman of unstuffy charm and classic beauty, regal in presence 
but highly accessible," author Ralph G. Martin wrote in his book, "Charles and 
Diana." "When she was Diana's age, she was also known as a marvelous dancer, a 
gay conversationalist who loved to laugh, adored children, had a craving for 
sweets and was a ballet addict. Her favorite jazz piece was 'Ain't Misbehavin.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But in her professional role, "she's got an enormous interest in whatever she's 
doing. That's the main thing that comes across," said Sir Eldon Griffiths, a 
member of Parliament who lives part time in Orange County, lectures at UCI and 
is the president of the county office of the World Affairs Council. "She does 
her homework and she's very well briefed. She, in fact, goes at it very hard." 
</P>
<P>
The princess visited Los Angeles in 1971, in connection with a promotion of 
British menswear. She will return briefly after her Orange County visit -- next 
Monday and Tuesday -- to, among other things, meet with Mayor Tom Bradley, 
visit Union Avenue Elementary School and observe a program for mothers of 
children born with a crack addiction at County Harbor/UCLA Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Mitchell, the princess' private secretary, said in a telephone interview 
from London that Alexandra was delighted by her last visit to Southern 
California and "thoroughly enjoys travel." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of schedule has become meat and potatoes for most members of the 
Royal Family, said John Houlton, a British vice consul based in Los Angeles. 
"They take their profession quite seriously," he said. "We think the princess 
in a sense serves in an ambassadorial role. She's a figurehead that people are 
interested in meeting." 
</P>
<P>
In a country of people whose ancestors absolutely hated King George III, modern 
British royals often are received with the sort of adulation usually reserved 
for rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
"In California," said Griffiths, "royalty is a rarity and its scarcity value 
gives it a much higher profile. There's a curiosity that is much more acute 
here than in Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Mere curiosity, however, does not fully explain the fawning looks that members 
of the British Royal Family see turned on them when they come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it intriguing, too. I have to say, that people in the U.S. -- and in 
France, too, which is also a republic -- are so intrigued," said Houlton. "I 
think that part of it is that the Royal Family are very much a national symbol 
of something that has endured for centuries. It has an air of majesty and 
romance to it. They're a symbol of permanence in a rather impermanent world 
these days." 
</P>
<P>
Princess Alexandra has felt the glare of celebrity almost all her life. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Christmas Day, 1936, (her fourth name commemorates her birthday), 
Alexandra is one of three children, and the only daughter, of Prince George and 
Princess Marina, Duke and Duchess of Kent. Her birth, said her grandmother, 
Queen Mary, was "the only nice thing to have happened this year" -- the year of 
the abdication of Edward VIII. 
</P>
<P>
She can trace her paternal lineage to Queen Victoria and, on her mother's side, 
to Czar Alexander II of Russia. (Queen Elizabeth is descended from royalty only 
on her father's side.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's father, the son of King George V and Queen Mary, died in 1942 in a 
plane crash on his way to tour RAF bases in Iceland. The princess was raised at 
Coppins, her family's country home in the Buckinghamshire village of Iver, by 
her mother, who was a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and his wife, the 
former Grand Duchess Helen of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Though Alexandra's mother was known as one of the most stylish and glamorous 
royals of her day, she enrolled her daughter as a student at Heathfield, an 
exclusive English girls' boarding school, making Alexandra the first British 
princess to attend a regular school. 
</P>
<P>
She continued her formal education in 1953-54 at a finishing school in Paris, 
staying with the family of the Count of Paris and studying French and music. 
When she returned to England, she took a nursing course at the Great Ormond 
Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, where she was known simply as 
Nurse Kent. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1950s, Alexandra had begun to take on more official royal duties, 
but she had also come to be known as the eligible young princess and began to 
be seen more in London social circles. 
</P>
<P>
Confrey Phillips, a English-born pianist who performs regularly at the Westin 
South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa and once played in London hotels and 
nightclubs, remembered that during that time Alexandra was "a very likable 
lady. At that time she was first sort of stepping out. She liked to be with 
friends and have a nice social evening somewhere privately. When I had my 
nightclub in Mayfair (The Colony on Berkeley Square) she'd come along with her 
friends and a couple of times with her husband-to-be, although that hadn't been 
announced at the time. She liked dancing and loved music." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently loved Phillips' music, because Phillips said he and his trio 
were hired to play at Buckingham Palace for the princess' 21st birthday 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 200 people there," said Phillips, "and it was a great 
success, a great party. There was continuous dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing kept up, said Phillips, even when his band took a break. A group of 
Princess Alexandra's friends who were amateur musicians acted as a relief band. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not at all aloof," said Phillips. "She's very relaxed and always has a 
lovely smile and a wonderful soft disposition about her. She's not wet and 
frumpish like some of these aristocrats can be. She's the least forbidding 
person you could meet." 
</P>
<P>
During the time she knew Phillips, Alexandra also became acquainted with a 
young commoner named Angus Ogilvy. Born in 1928, Ogilvy was the younger son of 
the Earl of Airlie and grandson of Mabell, Countess of Airlie, who was a close 
friend and lady-in-waiting to Alexandra's grandmother Queen Mary. After an 
eight-year friendship, the princess and Ogilvy were married in Westminster 
Abbey on April 24, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, by his own choice, was not catapulted into the aristocratic 
stratosphere by his marriage to Alexandra. When the queen offered him an 
earldom (a common practice when a princess marries someone of lesser rank), 
Ogilvy refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should get a peerage just because I married a princess," he 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But the queen did confer a knighthood on Ogilvy in 1989, making him a Knight 
Commander in the Royal Victorian Order. A businessman who is on the boards of 
directors of several British companies, Ogilvy accompanies the princess on many 
of her trips abroad (he will come with her to Southern California) and is 
properly addressed as Sir Angus. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogilvys have two children, James Robert Bruce, born in 1964 and now married 
to Julia Rawlinson, and Marina Victoria Alexandra, born in 1966 and now married 
to Paul Mowatt. Neither are titled and are not considered to be royal. Ogilvy 
once underscored the somewhat hybrid nature of his immediate family by 
referring to its members as "mini-royals" -- on the fringe of the queen's 
immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's many tours, duties and appearances -- Houlton estimated that she 
has made 90 official foreign tours -- entitle her to receive money from the 
Civil List, which is an allowance given to members of the Royal Family by 
Parliament to help pay for staff and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the public wrongly assumes that all royals are rich," wrote Ralph 
Martin. "Princess Alexandra . . . had no money of her own. Neither did Angus 
Ogilvy, since his older brother inherited both the family title and the family 
fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths said he believes the princess was the first member of the Royal 
Family to routinely drive herself from place to place and ride on the London 
Underground, rather than be chauffeured. (In fact, in 1962, she crashed her 
Austin Mini into a truck on London's Kensington High Street. She later admitted 
she had been driving a bit too fast.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra does, however, have an extensive collection of jewels that have come 
to her through her royal relatives. 
</P>
<P>
But the woman wearing the gems, so firmly rooted in royal tradition, apparently 
has little use for any pretense that might be attached to them. In the midst of 
the sometimes stifling pomp associated with royal appearances, she has shown a 
sense of good-humored proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget," she said of the Royal Family in the 1960s, "that nowadays we 
have to compete with Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles."

COUNTERPUNCH: ARE WE LOSING OUR FREEDOM TO SING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN T. MITCHELL, Mitchell practices law with Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin 
&amp; Kahn, a Washington firm that has represented the National Association of 
Recording Merchandisers on First Amendment issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two hundred and seventy-nine years ago, the colony of Massachusetts enacted a 
law stating that "wicked, profane, impure, filthy, and obscene songs . . . 
corrupt the mind and are incentives to all manner of impieties and 
debaucheries, more especially 
</P>
<P>
when digested, composed or uttered in imitation or in mimicking of preaching." 
</P>
<P>
Even Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III's 1986 Commission on Pornography, by no means a 
source of libertarian views, concedes that we have come a long way since 1711. 
Only visual images would, according to the Meese Report, be sufficiently 
explicit to awaken the wrath of the law by today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
It now appears that even Meese himself failed to predict how far his law 
enforcement colleagues would go to eradicate sinful words from our lips. A 
Florida music retailer now faces a possible year in jail and $1,000 fine for 
selling a song -- actually, an album full of songs by the rap group 2 Live Crew 
-- to a police officer. Similar prosecutions targeting music are cropping up 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to the First Amendment's declaration that the freedom of 
speech shall not be abridged? Through a series of Supreme Court decisions since 
1957, our highest court has determined that the First Amendment does not 
protect "obscene" speech. The Court went on to explain that for speech to be 
obscene it must meet three conditions: Appeal to a "prurient" interest in sex, 
contain descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct which are "patently 
offensive" to "contemporary community standards," and lack serious literacy, 
artistic or scientific value. 
</P>
<P>
The Court seems content with its nice "three-pronged test" for obscenity. There 
is something appealing about such a test. It gives the semblance of objectivity 
and provides fodder for law school students hungry for fast and easy rules of 
law. Most attorneys can give a rough rendition of this three-pronged test for 
obscenity, known as the Miller test, yet no one is capable of telling for 
certain whether something is obscene before a jury renders its decision. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when this test is applied to the controversial 2 Live Crew 
recordings, one would question whether the lyrics from the "As Nasty as They 
Wanna Be" album appeal to any interest in sex, whether prurient or not. 
Moreover, since rap music cannot be said to lack artistic value, one would 
logically conclude, as the Florida retailer did, that the album cannot be 
obscene. Nevertheless, a jury has applied the test and voted to convict the 
retailer. Thus, not even the most careful retailer can know for certain whether 
a particular work is obscene before selling it. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer may not know until the trial date whether the relevant community 
is that of the town, the county or the entire state. Previous cases provide 
little guidance either, since the elusive standard must be contemporary and is, 
therefore, subject to change from day to day. By the time the law finally 
determines that a 2 Live Crew album is obscene, the sale has already been made 
and the "crime" committed. 
</P>
<P>
As long as prosecutors were targeting only "adult" shops in red-light 
districts, it mattered little to the courts or the citizenry that few people 
know what a prurient interest in sex is, or how offensive something must be in 
order to be "patently" offensive to comunity standards. The average citizen's 
insulation from the dangers of obscenity laws came to a dramatic halt this 
year. Prosecutors are now using these laws to charge art museums and mainstream 
record stores with pandering obscenity. We laugh at the old Massachusetts law 
of 1711, but at least it was not enforced. Today, under ostensibly more 
reasonable laws, even popular singers are being handcuffed after their 
concerts. The time has come to rid ourselves of government interference in what 
we choose to watch or listen to. 
</P>
<P>
Let's accept for the moment the notion that some speech is so foul, so 
offensive, and so lacking in any other virtues that it does not merit the 
protection of the First Amendment. It does not follow that government has a 
duty to protect adults from buying it. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the 2 million people who have bought the 2 Live Crew album do not 
want that kind of government "protection." Those who chose not to buy the 
recording obviously do not need the government's protection. The only people 
served by the law are those who are offended at the thought that someone, 
somewhere, sometime, may enjoy reading, looking at or listening to such speech 
-- and it is precisely to protect us from such people that the First Amendment 
was written. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly we should shield children or involuntary adult witnesses from having 
offensive speech thrust upon them. That is a far cry from preventing access by 
willing adults to the "offensive" expression of others. Recent developments 
make it evident that when we abridge the freedom of a few, the rights of all of 
us are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
If our First Amendment means anything at all, it is that government shall make 
no law abridging the freedom of consenting adults to engage in offensive speech 
-- even patently offensive speech with no artistic value.

COUNTERPUNCH: LET'S HOPE CHILDREN'S TV ACT WILL VANQUISH NINJA TURTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE KUNKEL, Kunkel is assistant professor of telecommunications at Indiana 
University. He conducts research on children and television and has testified 
at congressional hearings on the Children's Television Act. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine what a different experience television would be for adults if the only 
programs offered were situation comedies and action-adventure shows. No evening 
news, no "60 Minutes," no music, culture, or drama -- only endless episodes 
built around laugh 
</P>
<P>
tracks and good-versus-evil fantasy themes. In such a world, television would 
no doubt be criticized for a lack of diversity and an overall failure to 
realize its potential. 
</P>
<P>
Now adjust the focus of this picture to programming for children. You can 
forget about the need for imagination. The range of children's programs 
provided by commercial television over the years has been little more than 
sitcoms and action-adventure formats, albeit mostly packaged in a genre better 
known as cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of occasional specials to aid their conscience, most 
stations offer no serious dramatic programs for children, no news or 
information shows, no series to stimulate children's curiosity about nature, 
science or the arts -- in short, no diversity, just "mind candy." 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Television Act just approved by Congress is meant to remedy this 
situation, as well as reverse the increasing commercialization of children's 
TV. But will it work? Can this regulation really accomplish meaningful change? 
</P>
<P>
A principal element of the bill is a requirement that stations serve the 
educational and informational needs of children through their overall 
programming, including content specifically designed for children. 
</P>
<P>
These last few words, specifically designed for children, are the key to the 
legislation's value. Simply requiring stations to serve children's needs 
through their "overall programming" would accomplish nothing new. Every 
broadcaster airing reruns of "The Cosby Show" or "Family Ties" could claim 
these shows have educational value for children, teaching them important social 
and moral lessons, and thus fulfill their obligation under the law. 
</P>
<P>
While such family-oriented programs indeed have merit, they don't address 
children's special needs and interests. Neither are they tailored to be readily 
comprehensible to young viewers, who may miss subtle elements in adult-oriented 
plots. Relying on them to serve the needs of our youth would be like 
constructing a building for a children's library, then filling it with books 
intended for adults. 
</P>
<P>
What new content are we likely to see under the new law, assuming President 
Bush doesn't veto it? I anticipate more reality-based programs, including some 
children's news shows. 
</P>
<P>
Educational game shows are a possibility. Any program premise to facilitate 
visits to distant lands and cultures would be attractive. Perhaps it's wishful 
thinking, but wouldn't it be terrific to see an important historical 
documentary like "The Civil War" translated into a form youngsters could 
understand? 
</P>
<P>
Commercial television's Achilles heel is that it treats all viewers the same, 
while children have special needs and limits in their comprehension abilities. 
Children's Television Workshop, which produces "Sesame Street," carefully 
researches each episode to ensure its appeal and comprehensibility to 
particular age ranges. This technique is expensive but effective and provides 
an excellent model for commercial TV to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
The act leaves the choice of content up to the good-faith judgment of each 
broadcaster. That leaves lots of room for creativity and diversity, as well as 
abuse. Not much will be accomplished if stations claim that "He-Man" or "G.I. 
Joe" are educational. 
</P>
<P>
The act also limits the amount of commercials during children's programs. Basic 
fairness requires that a consumer be able to weigh the fact that advertising 
claims and appeals may be biased and exaggerated. Young children inherently 
lack the reasoning abilities to make these judgments and thus are particularly 
vulnerable to commercial persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
The major oversight of the legislation is that the new limits on advertising 
during children's programming (12 minutes per hour on weekdays, 10.5 on 
weekends) apply solely to traditional forms of advertising: the 15-, 30- or 
60-second spot. 
</P>
<P>
The thorny problem that won't go away is advertising that masquerades as 
programming, or the so-called program-length commercial. 
</P>
<P>
By avoiding the topic of program-length commercials, the Children's Television 
Act creates a strange paradox. The breaks between programs may contain no more 
than 10.5 to 12 minutes of commercials per hour. In contrast, the programs 
themselves are virtually unlimited advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
This concern is hardly an idle one. "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" was taken 
from an existing comic-book series and packaged as part of a mass-merchandising 
campaign from its earliest stages of development. "Super Mario Brothers 3" on 
Saturday morning is obviously a video-game promotion, even including the 
product's most recent version number in the program title to ensure that young 
consumers aren't confused about what to buy. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, about half of all children's programs currently have direct 
product tie-ins. You can almost hear the toy manufacturers laughing behind 
Congress' back. Why worry about limits on 30-second ads when 30-minute versions 
work just fine? 
</P>
<P>
Except for this omission, the Children's Television Act is a very sound 
approach to improving kids' TV. History teaches us that broadcasters simply 
will not air educational programs when they can avoid it. That decision is 
based on simple economics. But even today, broadcasting remains more than a 
business. It is a trusteeship, licensed to serve the public interest. This bill 
should help to better tap TV's potential to benefit the nation's children.

'IMAGINE' ALL THE PEOPLE . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Radio stations in 125 countries will honor what would have been the late John 
Lennon's 50th birthday Tuesday with a simultaneous airing of his recording of 
"Imagine." The 7 a.m. PDT event will be preceded by a one-minute message 
delivered by Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, from the U.N. building in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Elliot Mintz said Ono, who worked out the concept in association with 
Los Angeles-based media consultant Jeff Pollack, hopes the event will spotlight 
attention on Lennon's birthday as opposed to the upcoming anniversary of his 
murder in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, Mintz said, is that on Tuesday, "you may be able to walk down any 
street in any city on the planet and hear 'Imagine' coming from people's cars, 
windows, stores or houses." 
</P>
<P>
Radio outlets from Australia and Thailand to the Soviet Union and newly-united 
Germany are scheduled to carry the program. Even military personnel in the 
Persian Gulf will be able to hear the airing via Armed Forces Radio. The song's 
video will also be aired at that time on MTV in the United States and on MTV 
Europe in 25 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. radio broadcast will be transmitted by the Westwood One network and 
can be heard in Southern California on KLSX-FM, KODJ-FM, KLOS-FM and KQLZ-FM 
(Pirate Radio) in Los Angeles, KCAL-FM in Redlands, KGGI-FM in Riverside, 
KKBB-FM in Bakersfield, and San Diego stations KSDO-FM and KGB-FM. STEVE

LOTTERY WINNER USES MONEY TO BUY CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They once had to worship in rented buildings and living rooms. On Sunday, the 
Simi Valley congregation filed into their own church, complete with a blue neon 
cross outside. 
</P>
<P>
For Lydia Neufeld, it was the fulfillment of a promise -- a promise she made 
during hard times and one that she kept after winning the state lottery last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, at age 20, Lydia Duran Neufeld was a high school dropout, a widow and 
the mother of six children. "I was just 14 when my first baby was born," she 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
She eventually came to work at a tiny church where the Rev. Jorge Gallindo was 
pastor. She recalls seeing Gallindo use his own money to help the church pay 
its bills. The congregation finally had to give up its building because it 
couldn't pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld decided then, she said, that if she ever came into money she would buy 
a church. 
</P>
<P>
After she won $17.1 million in the lottery, she remembered her pledge and 
thought of Gallindo's New Pact of God Church, a mostly Latino congregation that 
had been meeting at a member's home in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know what kind of a wonderful pastor he is and how faithful he is," 
Neufeld said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband of two years, Dave Neufeld, bought the former Temple Ner 
Tamid on Appleton Drive in Simi Valley for about $875,000. They financed the 
purchase through a Simi Valley bank, Neufeld said, and services started Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Avalos of Lake View Terrace, whose mother has provided her living room 
for services, said Sunday that she doesn't mind the 30-mile drive to her 
church's new home. "We believe this is the church God gave us," Avalos said. 
"We were praying for this church." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Torres of Sylmar, who brought her five children to the service Sunday, 
said many churches are closer to her home, but none are like the New Pact of 
God Church. "We thank God and Sister Lydia for this church," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 congregants attended the service Sunday in the well-lit, 
green-carpeted former synagogue. The wooden pews seat about 200 people, and 
Lydia Neufeld said she and Gallindo hope to hire another minister to conduct 
services in English and attract new members. Lydia Neufeld plans to help 
develop an outreach program to help young people, particularly problem 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The Neufelds are working on other good deeds. They are seeking permits from the 
city of Simi Valley to develop low-cost housing for senior citizens, the couple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They also have splurged a little, buying themselves two new luxury cars, 
purchasing a home for her parents and giving each of their children some cash, 
Lydia Neufeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to start traveling a little -- maybe next year," she said. "But we 
wanted to get this done first." 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Neufeld said that, 22 years ago, after her first husband was shot in 
neighborhood violence in the Venice area of Los Angeles, she never dreamed that 
she would not only be wealthy but able to help so many people. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel richly blessed," she said. "I feel overwhelmed and grateful that I have 
my family unity. Now, we want to do outreach for others." 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld said she chose the blue neon cross erected outside the church. "I just 
wanted a light to shine from there," she said.

SUPPORT GROWS FOR A TAX TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: AS TALKS WEAR ON, HOUSE REPUBLICANS ENDORSE A POSSIBLE COMPROMISE THAT 
WOULD RAISE RATES FOR RICH IN EXCHANGE FOR CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With much of the government shut down for lack of funds, congressional leaders 
struggled through the day Sunday to win bipartisan support for a new deficit 
reduction package to replace the $500-billion plan that was rejected by the 
House on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a development that could break the budget logjam and reopen government 
offices, House Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed suggestions for a compromise 
that would raise income taxes on the very rich in exchange for a reduction in 
capital gains tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
The straw vote -- which came in a closed caucus called to explore GOP sentiment 
for striking a new budget deal with the Democrats -- marked a stunning reversal 
of the hard-line approach that GOP leaders had taken at the negotiations that 
produced the earlier budget pact. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear, however, how quickly any such compromise could be 
put together. Democratic leaders said consideration of such a tax trade-off 
would have to wait until congressional committees take up details of any new 
package later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Democrats pushed a new plan of their own aimed at 
softening proposed Medicare cuts and shifting tax increases more toward the 
wealthy. But they said their own proposal would contain few specifics, leaving 
details for congressional committees to work out. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic plan also would reduce the extra share of Medicare costs that 
the program's beneficiaries would have to pay to only $12 billion over five 
years instead of $30 billion -- a move designed to gain crucial support of the 
elderly, who had protested the earlier plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had been especially leery about angering 
senior citizens, who constitute a potent bloc of voters in congressional 
elections, now less than a month away. Last week's plan sparked a barrage of 
phone calls and telegrams from the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) expressed hope that a new budget 
outline would be ready for action by the House late Sunday, in time to go to 
the Senate for a vote today. 
</P>
<P>
If a new package is adopted, the leaders then will seek to pass a separate 
stopgap funding measure, needed to reopen government agencies before Tuesday, 
when workers end a long Columbus Day weekend. Without such a resolution, most 
federal workers would be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush successfully vetoed a similar stopgap measure on Saturday and 
selectively closed down a number of government operations, saying that he 
wanted to keep the heat on Congress to approve a new deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
His action ignited partisan warfare on Capitol Hill, as the House failed by six 
votes to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, who pleaded with Bush not to force a confrontation that might destroy 
chances for a new bipartisan budget, vented uncharacteristic fury over the veto 
Sunday, even as he sought to reach a new compromise with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Bush of "creating a crisis that is totally artificial," charging 
that "We're injuring innocent people" affected by the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like saying we ought to rebuild the fiscal house of this country and he 
sets the House on fire for awhile to get our attention," Foley complained. 
</P>
<P>
Foley also sought to assuage rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers, who had been 
angered by the fact that they were left out of the 4 1/2-month-long 
negotiations between congressional leaders and top Bush Administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with reporters in an ornate lobby off the House floor, he pointedly 
noted that the new package was being drafted without any formal negotiations 
with White House officials -- though he conceded that they were being kept up 
to date informally. 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the Democrats' new budget plan is aimed at "appealing to 
members of both parties. It reduces the increased cost in the Medicare program 
and provides a more equitable and fair distribution of taxes." 
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would contain aggregate figures for reducing spending and 
increasing taxes but details would be left up to committees -- mainly the House 
Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a dime's worth of tax increases -- not 10 cents' worth of cuts in 
the budget resolution," he said. "It allows the committees to consider these 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
But that is just the thing that appears to concern Republicans the most. Many 
minority party members voiced fears Sunday that if the details of the plan are 
left to Democratic-controlled committees, the final package will not curb 
spending enough to keep tax increases to the bare minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got reservations about referring details to my committee," said Rep. Bill 
Archer (R-Tex.), top-ranking Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means 
panel. "We're out-numbered, 23 to 12." 
</P>
<P>
Added Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.): "We may get a bone out of the Democrats but 
certainly not a five-course meal." 
</P>
<P>
As behind-the-scenes negotiations wore on Sunday night without any sign of 
agreement, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) pressed for a stopgap spending 
bill that would impose $40.1 billion in across-the-board cuts until Congress 
can produce a permanent budget. 
</P>
<P>
Normally mild-mannered, Foley erupted in fury at Gingrich's suggestion that 
Congress was blocking a deal that would allow government operations to resume 
by refusing to cooperate with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the people in this House, in this country, that has little claim to 
cooperating with his President, it is the gentleman from Georgia," Foley 
declared to cheers and applause from fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) stormed onto 
the floor to announce that he had been waiting for the last six hours in the 
office of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine with Senate budget 
negotiators from both parties, but that no House Republican had shown up. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that someone would come from your side," Gephardt told GOP members, "so 
that what the President has asked us to do for five months (and) yesterday and 
today -- to get a budget resolution" can be done. 
</P>
<P>
At their own caucus Sunday, Republicans debated whether to continue seeking a 
compromise with the Democrats or instead to adopt a strategy of confrontation, 
seeking to force Congress to enact deep spending cuts by persuading Bush to 
veto appropriations bills deemed excessive. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), one of those favoring a new 
bipartisan accord, asked for a show of hands on a proposal to cut the tax on 
capital gains to 20% -- from 33% now -- in exchange for boosting the ordinary 
income tax rate on the wealthy to 32% from 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said the plan -- which they said would reduce the deficit by 
$13 billion over five years -- drew surprising support. 
</P>
<P>
"There was at least a two-thirds majority for it," Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) told 
reporters later. "I think the leadership was stunned." 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, even conservative Republicans such as Gingrich, who originally 
opposed income tax hikes, have shown a willingness to consider such a tax swap 
in hopes that lower capital gains rates would help stimulate the ailing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
However, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said Sunday that the 
Administration still opposes raising the top income tax rate. "We think we 
ought to draw the line on tax rates and not raise the rates," he said on CNN's 
"Newsmaker Sunday" program. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, obviously rankled that Gingrich had led a House GOP rebellion that 
helped sink the original budget compromise, noted that it was Gingrich and 
other Republicans who had insisted earlier on holding fast against any change 
in income tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of flipping at this point on some of the specific markers that were 
laid down is kind of surprising," Sununu said.

U.S. GULF ARSENAL APPEARS FAR FROM FAIL-SAFE IN WAR 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April, 1980, eight U.S. helicopters took off from the aircraft carrier 
Nimitz in the Arabian Sea on a mission to rescue 52 American hostages in Iran. 
The mission, planned and rehearsed in excruciating detail, seemed fail-safe. 
</P>
<P>
But reality was unkind to the U.S. rescue team. Although the choppers worked 
well enough in the United States, they couldn't handle conditions in the 
desert. Two of the helicopters never reached the remote staging area 200 miles 
from Tehran. A third developed hydraulic problems and couldn't continue the 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort was called off because there weren't enough remaining 
choppers to do the job. The mission, code-named Desert One, ended in disaster 
when a helicopter and a C-130 transport crashed as the commandos fled the 
landing zone, killing eight servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the failure of Desert One stands as testament that the best-laid battle 
plans of policy-makers and generals often can go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That lesson looms today in the U.S. troop deployment in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. 
contingent includes nearly 200,000 troops and an impressive array of weapons 
systems: M1-A1 tanks and multiple rocket launchers, cruise missiles and 
laser-guided bombs, Stealth fighters and radar-seeking rockets. 
</P>
<P>
But in the remorseless arithmetic of the battlefield, there are serious 
questions whether U.S. forces have enough of what they need -- and whether 
their equipment actually will do what it is assigned to do. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, while U.S. weapons are technologically advanced, analysts fret 
that commanders may not always have enough reliable weapons to counter Iraq's 
estimated 5,500 battle-tested heavy tanks, thousands of artillery tubes and 
scores of ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the U.S. combat force in the desert lacks experience in war. And 
armies in combat learn quickly that campaigns seldom go as planned, weapons 
seldom work as advertised and men rarely perform as trained. 
</P>
<P>
Plans go out the window when the first shot is fired, Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted in describing the first hours of 
the Panama operation last winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in tested armies, things go wrong when combat commences," said Arizona's 
Sen. John McCain, a former Navy pilot shot down over North Vietnam in 1967. 
"With an untested army, you can count on it." 
</P>
<P>
There are these anomalies: 
</P>
<P>
* If shooting starts in Saudi Arabia, the Army will rely heavily on the 
tank-killing capabilities of the Apache helicopter, the newest and most lethal 
chopper in the U.S. inventory. But the Apache has proven to be a highly 
temperamental bird, failing many of the Army's own standards for reliability. 
</P>
<P>
The Army expects to fly the complex helicopter four hours a day in combat. But 
under the far less rigorous conditions of peacetime training, Apaches break 
down and require major maintenance every 2 1/2 hours, according to a 
congressional report released last week. At any given time, only half of the 
Army's Apache fleet is capable of carrying out its job, far below the Army's 
70% "mission-capable" goal, Congress' General Accounting Office found. 
</P>
<P>
In what could stand as a stark warning to U.S. commanders in Saudi Arabia, the 
GAO wrote: "Given that the Apache has not been able to attain availability 
goals in peacetime despite favorable conditions, it is questionable whether it 
can meet the far more strenuous demands of high-intensity combat." 
</P>
<P>
* Even in a relatively benign training environment, some of America's most 
advanced weapons -- including the M1-A1 tank and the Apache -- fail with 
alarming frequency. The M1-A1 tank, flagship of U.S. armor and a mainstay of 
the desert deployment, breaks down during exercises after an average of only 
152 miles. The tank experiences some system failure -- electronic or mechanical 
-- every 21 minutes. The Army's standards are 320 miles and 101 minutes between 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
* High-technology systems such as the Navy's Aegis-class guided-missile cruiser 
and the F-117 Stealth fighter have sometimes proven too complex for their human 
operators in the real world of combat. The crew of the cruiser Vincennes shot 
down an Iranian jetliner in 1988 because of chaos in the computerized combat 
information center. A Stealth fighter missed its target in Panama last December 
by 160 yards after pilots became confused over their orders and the wind 
changed direction. 
</P>
<P>
These errors were caused not by inherent mechanical flaws in the systems, which 
the Pentagon and the weapons-makers staunchly defend, but because of human 
error compounded by the stress of battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The F-117's performance in Panama left it open to question," says Bill Arkin, 
a military critic at the environmental group Greenpeace. He noted that a system 
as complicated as a state-of-the-art jet fighter or a computerized missile 
cruiser can overwhelm its human operators, regardless of the machine's 
theoretical capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"While it may work well in computer simulations, in the lab, in conditions at 
training at Nellis (Air Force Base in Nevada) on a sunny day when the guy's had 
a good night's sleep, the people factor in a real war is very different," Arkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes incident also dramatized the problems of discriminating between 
civilian and military targets and between friendly and hostile forces. With 
more than two dozen allied armies contemplating joint action against Iraq, and 
with many of the same weapons in use by both sides, the potential for 
catastrophic error on the battlefield is magnified, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
* The Pentagon has also deployed a variety of weapons that have never been 
tested in combat, including a raft of electronic warfare systems and the Army's 
most advanced antiaircraft and antimissile weapon, the Patriot surface-to-air 
interceptor. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the Patriot works as well in Saudi Arabia as it does at the White 
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, so few have been deployed that commanders 
worry about their ability to defend critical installations, including oil 
fields, air bases and troop encampments. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th-Century Prussian general and writer on military strategy, Karl von 
Clausewitz, called the snafu phenomenon "friction" -- the tendency in combat 
for everything possible to go awry. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary military strategist Edward N. Luttwak noted, "The chief reason why 
armies experience problems -- sometimes severe problems, occasionally crippling 
problems -- at the outset of a war is that in designing their forces, they have 
underestimated or overlooked the effects of friction. Friction is hard to 
estimate. It's not a single obstacle. But in wartime, a thousand little things 
go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, American commanders have a more than ample supply of certitude that 
their men and their machines will prevail against the forces of Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"If he dares, if he dares come across that border and come down here, I'm 
completely confident that we're going to kick his butt," says U.S. Mideast 
commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force generals speculate that the Iraqi air force and air defenses can be 
crushed in a matter of hours. A Marine Corps officer recently promised Iraqi 
forces "the most violent five minutes" they have ever experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of their weapons, the vast majority of U.S. troops in the region have 
never experienced combat. Recent military experiences, from the botched Iran 
hostage rescue mission in 1980 to the successful but less-than-perfect Panama 
invasion last December, ought to provide a sobering reminder to U.S. generals 
that war is inherently an unpredictable enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Superior tactics, training and technology do not always guarantee success, as 
the United States learned to its sorrow in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I have confidence in the ability of our forces to ultimately prevail 
militarily, I don't believe it will be as easy as some envision," said McCain. 
"I worry about what appears to be some commanders' overconfidence, because 
overconfidence leads to error." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. war planners and politicians consistently underestimated 
North Vietnam's capabilities and tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a total misplaced confidence in ability of our tactical air power to 
have impact on the North Vietnamese ability to wage war," McCain said. He 
warned that U.S. military leaders should be wary of underestimating Iraq's 
capacity to withstand the pain of U.S. aerial bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
Clausewitz noted that warfare was not a technical exercise against a static 
entity, but rather an application of will upon "an animate object that reacts." 
And animate objects often react in unpredictable ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We frequently misjudge the enemy -- we misjudged Ho Chi Minh and the North 
Vietnamese," said Fred S. Hoffman, a former senior Pentagon spokesman. "What 
(former Defense Secretary Robert S.) McNamara thought was logical wasn't 
logical to the enemy. We may be doing the same in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
And it's not only the enemy that reacts in unpredictable or illogical ways. 
More battles have been lost to blunder than to superior firepower or strategy, 
military analysts noted. 
</P>
<P>
Military historian Harry G. Summers, a retired Army infantry colonel, cited the 
first battle of the Somme in World War I, when British Gen. Henry Rawlinson 
erred in believing that he could level German positions with a massive 
artillery barrage and not have to fight his way through them. 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. On the day of the attack, the British forces lost 19,240 men in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Rawlinson's miscalculation, Summers noted, was the same error underlying former 
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael J. Dugan's faith that air power alone can 
be decisive against Iraq's huge and well-entrenched army. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Karl von Clausewitz, who was born in 1780 and fought with the Prussian army in 
all of the campaigns against Napoleon in the early 19th Century, is considered 
one of the greatest war strategists. After leaving the army, he devoted much of 
his time to writing about the military. His best-known work is "On War," which 
embodies his theories and doctrines and is often quoted, even by his critics. 
It is a book that has cast an indelible stamp on all subsequent military 
thought. Although Clausewitz believed that he had discovered the fundamental 
laws of war, he insisted that in practice these are always subject to an almost 
infinite number of external influences that often lead to disastrous results on 
the battlefield.

SUPPORT GROWS FOR A TAX TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICIT: AS TALKS WEAR ON, HOUSE REPUBLICANS ENDORSE A POSSIBLE COMPROMISE THAT 
WOULD RAISE RATES FOR RICH IN EXCHANGE FOR CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With much of the government shut down for lack of funds, congressional leaders 
struggled through the day Sunday to win bipartisan support for a new deficit 
reduction package to replace the $500-billion plan that was rejected by the 
House on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a development that could break the budget logjam and reopen government 
offices, House Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed suggestions for a compromise 
that would raise income taxes on the very rich in exchange for a reduction in 
capital gains tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
The straw vote -- which came in a closed caucus called to explore GOP sentiment 
for striking a new budget deal with the Democrats -- marked a stunning reversal 
of the hard-line approach that GOP leaders had taken at the negotiations that 
produced the earlier budget pact. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear, however, how quickly any such compromise could be 
put together. Democratic leaders said consideration of such a tax trade-off 
would have to wait until congressional committees take up details of any new 
package later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Democrats pushed a new plan of their own aimed at 
softening proposed Medicare cuts and shifting tax increases more toward the 
wealthy. But they said their own proposal would contain few specifics, leaving 
details for congressional committees to work out. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic plan also would reduce the extra share of Medicare costs that 
the program's beneficiaries would have to pay to only $12 billion over five 
years instead of $30 billion -- a move designed to gain crucial support of the 
elderly, who had protested the earlier plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had been especially leery about angering 
senior citizens, who constitute a potent bloc of voters in congressional 
elections, now less than a month away. Last week's plan sparked a barrage of 
phone calls and telegrams from the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) expressed hope that a new budget 
outline would be ready for action by the House late Sunday, in time to go to 
the Senate for a vote today. 
</P>
<P>
If a new package is adopted, the leaders then will seek to pass a separate 
stopgap funding measure, needed to reopen government agencies before Tuesday, 
when workers end a long Columbus Day weekend. Without such a resolution, most 
federal workers would be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush successfully vetoed a similar stopgap measure on Saturday and 
selectively closed down a number of government operations, saying that he 
wanted to keep the heat on Congress to approve a new deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
His action ignited partisan warfare on Capitol Hill, as the House failed by six 
votes to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, who pleaded with Bush not to force a confrontation that might destroy 
chances for a new bipartisan budget, vented uncharacteristic fury over the veto 
Sunday, even as he sought to reach a new compromise with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
He accused Bush of "creating a crisis that is totally artificial," charging 
that "We're injuring innocent people" affected by the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like saying we ought to rebuild the fiscal house of this country and he 
sets the House on fire for awhile to get our attention," Foley complained. 
</P>
<P>
Foley also sought to assuage rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers, who had been 
angered by the fact that they were left out of the 4 1/2-month-long 
negotiations between congressional leaders and top Bush Administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with reporters in an ornate lobby off the House floor, he pointedly 
noted that the new package was being drafted without any formal negotiations 
with White House officials -- though he conceded that they were being kept up 
to date informally. 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the Democrats' new budget plan is aimed at "appealing to 
members of both parties. It reduces the increased cost in the Medicare program 
and provides a more equitable and fair distribution of taxes." 
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would contain aggregate figures for reducing spending and 
increasing taxes but details would be left up to committees -- mainly the House 
Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a dime's worth of tax increases -- not 10 cents' worth of cuts in 
the budget resolution," he said. "It allows the committees to consider these 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
But that is just the thing that appears to concern Republicans the most. Many 
minority party members voiced fears Sunday that if the details of the plan are 
left to Democratic-controlled committees, the final package will not curb 
spending enough to keep tax increases to the bare minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got reservations about referring details to my committee," said Rep. Bill 
Archer (R-Tex.), top-ranking Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means 
panel. "We're out-numbered, 23 to 12." 
</P>
<P>
Added Rep. Jack Buechner (R-Mo.): "We may get a bone out of the Democrats but 
certainly not a five-course meal." 
</P>
<P>
As behind-the-scenes negotiations wore on Sunday night without any sign of 
agreement, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) pressed for a stopgap spending 
bill that would impose $40.1 billion in across-the-board cuts until Congress 
can produce a permanent budget. 
</P>
<P>
Normally mild-mannered, Foley erupted in fury at Gingrich's suggestion that 
Congress was blocking a deal that would allow government operations to resume 
by refusing to cooperate with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the people in this House, in this country, that has little claim to 
cooperating with his President, it is the gentleman from Georgia," Foley 
declared to cheers and applause from fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) stormed onto 
the floor to announce that he had been waiting for the last six hours in the 
office of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine with Senate budget 
negotiators from both parties, but that no House Republican had shown up. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that someone would come from your side," Gephardt told GOP members, "so 
that what the President has asked us to do for five months (and) yesterday and 
today -- to get a budget resolution" can be done. 
</P>
<P>
At their own caucus Sunday, Republicans debated whether to continue seeking a 
compromise with the Democrats or instead to adopt a strategy of confrontation, 
seeking to force Congress to enact deep spending cuts by persuading Bush to 
veto appropriations bills deemed excessive. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), one of those favoring a new 
bipartisan accord, asked for a show of hands on a proposal to cut the tax on 
capital gains to 20% -- from 33% now -- in exchange for boosting the ordinary 
income tax rate on the wealthy to 32% from 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said the plan -- which they said would reduce the deficit by 
$13 billion over five years -- drew surprising support. 
</P>
<P>
"There was at least a two-thirds majority for it," Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) told 
reporters later. "I think the leadership was stunned." 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, even conservative Republicans such as Gingrich, who originally 
opposed income tax hikes, have shown a willingness to consider such a tax swap 
in hopes that lower capital gains rates would help stimulate the ailing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
However, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said Sunday that the 
Administration still opposes raising the top income tax rate. "We think we 
ought to draw the line on tax rates and not raise the rates," he said on CNN's 
"Newsmaker Sunday" program. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu, obviously rankled that Gingrich had led a House GOP rebellion that 
helped sink the original budget compromise, noted that it was Gingrich and 
other Republicans who had insisted earlier on holding fast against any change 
in income tax rates.

FEINSTEIN, WILSON IN BITTER CLASH AT DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HE ATTACKS HER ACCEPTANCE OF LARGE CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. SHE CRITICIZES 
HIS SENATE ATTENDANCE RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gubernatorial candidates Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson clashed Sunday in 
their first debate on Wilson's U.S. Senate attendance record, campaign funding 
and their visions for the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
In a live, televised session, Democrat Feinstein and Republican Wilson both 
claimed to be the candidate of new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a need for someone that's fresh, new and a little bit 
different," said Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that being a Republican would not handcuff him in Sacramento, where 
the Legislature is dominated by Democrats. He also portrayed himself as a 
reformer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running for governor because I want to make changes in California that I 
think need to be made," said Wilson, a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate quickly turned to attacks, some of them personal. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein accused Wilson of having "the worst attendance record in the 
Congress," missing votes on the death penalty, Supreme Court confirmation, 
Middle East resolutions and the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I think absenteeism is an important indication of performance," Feinstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson countered that he has a 93% attendance record overall, 2% better than 
Democratic California U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the offensive, Wilson criticized Feinstein for accepting large campaign 
donations in the wake of a judge's overturning of Proposition 73, which had 
limited individual donations to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
He singled out Feinstein's acceptance of $150,000 from a California Highway 
Patrol organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne, I am truly shocked that you would be so blind to so gross a conflict 
of interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour debate, televised from KNBC-TV's studios in Burbank, marked the 
first time the rivals for governor have met face-to-face in eight months, and 
their first-ever televised showdown. A second and final televised debate is 
scheduled Oct. 18 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was divided into two segments: 30 minutes of questions from a panel 
of political reporters followed by 30 minutes in which Feinstein and Wilson 
questioned each other. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a month to go before the Nov. 6 balloting to succeed retiring 
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, the two televised debates could be decisive 
because Wilson and Feinstein have been virtually tied in every independent poll 
published since winning their party nominations in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
The two most recent polls, both conducted in the final few days of September, 
reported Feinstein ahead by two percentage points and Wilson by one point, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But if the debates are decisive, it won't be because millions of Californians 
watched the full 60-minute confrontations. By contrast, ratings for both were 
expected to be low. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday debate was up against the second game of the American League 
baseball championship series between Oakland and Boston on one network and a 
Los Angeles Raiders-Buffalo Bills NFL football game on cable television and 
local TV.

COUNTY OBSTETRICS PLAN SEEN AS MERE STOPGAP; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: PROPOSAL TO EASE OVERCROWDING IN THE SYSTEM CALLS FOR DIVERTING 
POOR PREGNANT WOMEN TO PRIVATE HOSPITALS WITH EMPTY BEDS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
SOARING BIRTHRATE, EVEN THAT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH. 
</P>

<P>
A plan to relieve overcrowding in the county obstetrical system has received a 
significant financial boost from state health officials as well as encouraging 
response from private hospitals and doctors willing to take greater 
responsibility for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
But a new report issued by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health has 
revealed that the plan -- involving diversion of poor pregnant women from 
overcrowded public hospitals to private hospitals with empty beds -- is little 
more than a stopgap measure. 
</P>
<P>
If all of the private hospitals with maternity service agreed to take indigent 
patients, there still wouldn't be enough obstetrical beds in Los Angeles County 
to cope with the births projected for this year, said Dr. Gary A. Richwald, 
lead author on a study of obstetrical capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Richwald's study, commissioned by the health department a year ago when 
Richwald was on the faculty of UCLA's School of Public Health, projects 209,000 
births in Los Angeles County this year, a 7.8% increase over last year's record 
193,517. That will be 10% more than the combined capacity of every existing 
obstetrical service in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary's study is good and it is accurate and it means that we've got real 
trouble coming at us," said Anthony J. Abbate, a senior vice president of the 
Hospital Council of Southern California. "All we've been doing is identifying 
wiggle room in the system. There isn't the capacity really to make you 
comfortable in the next 12 to 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
The study's conclusions have given health officials a dual mission in their 
negotiations with private hospitals: get them to shoulder part of the load of 
indigent patients as well as convert underutilized sections of their hospital 
to obstetrics. A significant number of hospitals in Los Angeles County have 
empty beds in the medical and surgical specialties, a money-losing occupancy 
problem generally handled by reducing staff and closing down units. 
</P>
<P>
Converting those units to obstetrical use costs money -- in very short supply 
in the health care system. But Audrey Bahr, chief of health resources 
development for the county health department, says the financial hurdle must be 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 24 (private) hospitals with 1,200 delivery slots and I need 2,000 right 
now," Bahr said. "And by the year 2000, I'll need 4,000." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate problem, Bahr said, is the critical need for room for 800 more 
deliveries per month to relieve the patient load on the county's four public 
hospitals with obstetrical units. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is to vote Tuesday on a plan that would allow the 
health department to act as an intermediary between participating hospitals and 
Medi-Cal, cutting much of the red tape and payment delays that have made the 
public insurance program unappealing to the private sector. The proposal also 
would boost the state's daily rate for hospitalization of obstetrical patients 
from $600 to $790, and make it possible for hospitals without Medi-Cal 
contracts to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The state generally has required hospitals receiving Medi-Cal money to provide 
a full range of services to poor patients and not just one, such as obstetrics. 
County health officials have been seeking an exemption from this rule for more 
than two years to deal with the county's soaring birth rate. Last month, 
bolstered by support from the hospital council and the Los Angeles County 
Medical Assn., the county's latest plan won the approval of state Medi-Cal 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ringrose, the state's chief negotiator, said he was persuaded by the 
severity of the problem in Los Angeles County and by the active role the county 
health department pledged to take in supervising the care of patients. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the hospital council and medical association have been 
instrumental in getting the private sector to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
If the supervisors approve the contracting proposal before them, Bahr said, she 
has three private hospitals ready to sign up -- adding 110 obstetrical beds per 
month to the system. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital council has a list of 10 more hospitals that are close to 
agreements, and another 20 that are "very interested," according to David 
Langness, the council's vice president for community affairs. The latter group, 
he said, are still negotiating with their medical staffs and others whose 
cooperation is needed for success. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many players . . . that it takes time to iron out the details," 
Langness said. "But we think they will be ironed out. It just takes time." 
</P>
<P>
Carl A. Williams, the county's administrator for hospitals, said he hopes the 
state's decision to raise the daily hospitalization rate to $790 will attract 
more private hospitals to the program. And as doctors and hospitals get used to 
the program, he would like to see women referred into private care earlier in 
their pregnancies. That would be the best way to reduce the stress on the 
county hospitals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the doctors, 50 have signed contracts to participate in the program, 
according to Dr. David Chernof, the medical association's president, who wrote 
a letter of endorsement accompanying the health department's mailing of 
contracts. Chernof said the response is encouraging, but he is considering a 
follow-up letter to push for more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a little frustrating that you just can't push a button and make this 
work," said Abbate, who has been in the thick of the negotiations. "But it is a 
people system. It is one doctor delivering one baby for one woman. So it 
involves a great many people and that is hard to pull together."

CONVICTED KILLER SAYS LAWYERS' FEUD PREVENTED FAIR TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
APPEAL: HE SAYS HIS COUNSEL AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD A SHORT-LIVED ROMANCE 
AND WERE ENGAGED IN A BITTER PATERNITY DISPUTE.

<P>
Was a murder defendant denied a fair trial because of a short-lived romance and 
a bitter paternity dispute between his lawyer and the district attorney? 
</P>
<P>
That intriguing question is now before a state Court of Appeal here in a novel 
case that might seem better-suited for a television screen were it not for the 
serious ethical issue at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The real-life plot centers on an appeal by Thomas John Marston, a 30-year-old 
Willits millworker convicted in 1985 of killing two men in an abortive 
marijuana deal. Marston is seeking a retrial on grounds he was the unknowing 
victim of a private feud between his trial attorney, Richard J. Petersen, and 
the prosecutor, former Mendocino County Dist. Atty. Vivian L. Rackauckas. 
</P>
<P>
Marston's new lawyer on appeal charges that Rackauckas had a sexual liaison 
with Petersen before Marston's trial, then cited Petersen as father of her 
child, repeatedly threatened during the trial to bring a paternity suit against 
Petersen and even had the child send him "Dear Daddy" greetings at special 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the evidence is a 1988 court order requiring Petersen to pay $765 a 
month in child support to Rackauckas. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was tried in the legal equivalent of a sewer, a cesspool filled with 
the squalor of covert, private conflicts of interest," said Richard L. Huff, a 
Ukiah lawyer now representing Marston. "Unknowingly, (Marston) was caught in a 
cross-fire inimical to our belief in fundamental fairness." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen, in a sworn declaration, said the charges of a sexual liaison and a 
paternity dispute with Rackauckas are true. Rackauckas, now a deputy district 
attorney in Ventura County, submitted an affidavit acknowledging the love 
affair but contending that relationship ended six years before the trial. She 
denied threatening Petersen, and said that during the trial, they both 
conducted themselves with "appropriate professionalism." It was not until after 
the trial, in 1988, that she filed suit for child support, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a further twist, a Ukiah woman has submitted yet another affidavit stating 
that at a 1983 Christmas party, Rackauckas remarked "matter-of-factly" that her 
son's father was Mendocino Superior Court Judge Arthur Broaddus, who later 
served as trial judge in the Marston case. Rackauckas denied having a sexual 
relationship with the judge or making any such statement. Broaddus also denied 
such a relationship ever existed. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Donna B. Chew, representing the prosecution on appeal, 
agreed the case "raises very important factual as well as legal allegations." 
</P>
<P>
But in a brief filed last week, Chew contends Marston has failed to show that 
an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer's performance. 
Even if there was antagonism between the prosecutor and defense attorney, the 
defendant might have benefited from the hostility felt by his lawyer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chew added, however, that if the appeals court believes Marston has raised 
legally plausible claims, it should order a hearing to further weigh the 
conflicting evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Huff's appeal for Marston centers on the right of a defendant to be 
represented by a lawyer free of conflict of interest, and to be prosecuted by a 
district attorney free of emotional involvement in a case. 
</P>
<P>
Ethical guidelines published by the California District Attorneys Assn. require 
prosecutors to withdraw where they have a personal interest in a case that may 
affect their impartiality. 
</P>
<P>
There is little legal precedent for the case. But in a 1985 case, another 
appeals court, citing the potential for conflict of interest, reversed a 
defendant's conviction because a prosecutor and defense attorney had dated 
before and during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses' statements, at the Marston trial Rackauckas and 
Petersen exchanged cutting remarks -- sotto voce but still audible to jurors -- 
and behind the scenes had angry discussions about child support. One associate 
said Rackauckas adopted an office policy of "maximum obstruction and minimum 
cooperation" with Petersen, hindering the routine exchange of evidence before 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
After Marston received a sentence of life in prison without parole, Rackauckas 
was quoted by a witness as having said, "a lifetime of being sodomized in 
prison" would be a suitable alternative to the death penalty, Marston's appeal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also submitted was a statement from Dist. Atty. Susan Massini. In it, Massini 
says files on the Marston case were missing when she assumed office in 1987 
after Rackauckas was defeated for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
In her sworn statement, Rackauckas called the affidavits as a whole 
"misleading, out-of-context or inaccurate." Any personal relationship with 
Petersen ended when her child was conceived in March, 1980, she said. Petersen 
denied in 1981 that he was the father and the matter was not discussed again 
until 1986, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rackauckas rejected the claim she had any "special policy" on cases handled by 
Petersen and said she could not recall discussing "anything about sodomy" in 
the Marston case. 
</P>
<P>
At her request, Rackauckas said, she and Petersen discussed the 1985 appeals 
court ruling on conflict of interest and whether he should represent Marston. 
Neither believed their former relationship created such a conflict, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed that no local attorney would represent Marston as vigorously and as 
well as would Mr. Petersen," Rackauckas said. "Feeling that it was unfair on my 
part to suggest depriving Mr. Marston of the attorney of his choice and 
possibly the most capable attorney in the area, I did nothing further with 
regard to the matter."

Carol and R.T. Flowers took a Greyhound from Meeker, Okla., (pop. 1,140) to San 
Pedro to see how their daughter, Terri, and her two children were doing now 
that Terri's husband was stuck on a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
They found that life, good and bad, is settling down to normal. 
</P>
<P>
Ali, 4, started kindergarten this month at Eshelman Elementary School in 
Lomita. For the first time, a boy tried to kiss her. 
</P>
<P>
Annie, 7, lost another tooth. Last week she won a pass to Knott's Berry Farm 
for her school work. 
</P>
<P>
The girls don't worry as much about their father, Howard Morris, a petty 
officer first class aboard the Antietam, a guided missile cruiser. He had 
shipped out of Long Beach Naval Station June 20 on a routine tour of duty in 
the Indian Ocean. Within a week after Iraq invaded Kuwait, however, his cruiser 
was deployed to the Persian Gulf with two other warships from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"At least he's not going to die," Annie says now. 
</P>
<P>
'The news reports make it seem like all the military families are falling apart 
while our spouses are gone," Terri said, sitting in a lawn chair, shivering as 
the sun went down. "But we are continuing with our lives." Hers includes 
fighting her own battle with multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Most folks back in Meeker -- most noted as the birthplace of New York Giants 
pitcher Carl Hubbell -- don't pay much attention to the crisis in the Gulf, 
said Carol and R.T., keeping an eye on the girls, who were playing with other 
children from the complex of Navy housing. 
</P>
<P>
In Meeker they grumble about the price of gas for their tractors and cars at 
the filling station, but the invasion rarely comes up during talk over coffee 
and doughnuts at the cafe. It is just too far away from their farming 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand what the purpose is to start with," said R.T., a quiet man, 
staring at his feet. "It's oil, it's greed. That's what it boils down to. 
Greed." He nodded his head. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was different. Plenty of local boys went over, including Terri's older 
brother, Lynn, in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"He came home," Carol said. One local boy didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Meeker News is full of reports about county fairs and school sports, 
recipes, and birth and death announcements. The front-page editorials, called 
Jelly Sez after Jelly Clark, the 95-year-old former town mayor who writes them, 
have dealt with memories of the town's old streetcars and Labor Day parades. 
Terri mails the paper to Howard. "The guys on the ship get a big kick out of 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Howard, a former star football player for Meeker High School, sends 
the former Lincoln County, Okla., Dairy Princess Pageant's Miss Congeniality 
love poems: 
</P>
<P>
 There are rhymes and a word for every emotion ... I love you, even from the 
middle of this damned ocean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A few houses up the street, Betty Taylor says she has been so busy she 
sometimes almost forgets that her husband is away on the Prairie. Terry Taylor 
is a petty officer first class aboard the repair and supply vessel, which is on 
standby in the West Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Betty is helping to coordinate the ship's homecoming in December. The navy 
spouses are making a 110-foot-long lei for when the ship returns. She has to 
get scores of sawhorses for the ship's pier, and 10 crates of mistletoe shipped 
from Texas to decorate the sawhorses. Plus she needs doughnuts and drinks on 
hand. And, of course, a good Santa to welcome the ship home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost over with," Betty said. 
</P>
<P>
Her nightmares about her husband being involved in a disaster at sea have 
ended, Betty said. Now she's dreaming about his homecoming -- "But it's not 
fun! I keep dreaming about what details I'm forgetting!" 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, mom," said Melisa Kennedy, 12. She was talking to a tape machine in her 
family's San Pedro living room. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Kennedy family sent a letter on cassette to mom -- also known as 
Dorothy Gale Kennedy, chief petty officer aboard the Prairie. The Prairie is 
now in Japan, where it has been put on standby in case anything flares up in 
the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"How're you doing?" Melisa asked, wiggling her toes in the family cat's fur. 
"So far I've gotten three A's. And, well, the other day we saw a crash on the 
way to Smile Care. I got my bottom wires on my teeth. School is fun. One time, 
we had to do 30 jumping jacks until we got it right." 
</P>
<P>
Their dad, Steve, picked up the machine. He hesitated. "Tell her Calico is 
eating Patrick's foot right now!" Melisa suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Steve clicked off the machine and glared at his son. "How long have you been 
wearing those socks?" he scolded in jest. "No wonder the cats like them, they 
have every smell in the world!" 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy family has adjusted to life without their mother. Steve has become 
adept at the laundry and balancing odd jobs and dinner. The kids are getting 
their chores and schoolwork done. About the worst thing that has happened to 
them this month is that their pet Minnie Mouse died. 
</P>
<P>
Approaching the end of his first month back on active duty, Dr. Jon Greif, 45, 
lives in the Bachelor Officers Quarters at the Charleston Naval Base in what 
could charitably be called a "hotel-style" room. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit spartan," Greif says. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Kate, a CPA in San Diego who remained home when he was called up, is 
trying to pool her income with her husband's Navy paycheck to stay current on 
mortgage payments and keep their 5-year-old son, Ian, in a private school. 
</P>
<P>
It's a task that gets harder every day. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Greif, a general surgeon at Kaiser Permanente since 1986, arrived in South 
Carolina on Aug. 29. His reserve unit had been ordered to staff the San Diego 
Naval Hospital, but Greif -- Cmdr. Greif in the U.S. Navy -- was tapped to fill 
a vacancy in Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
He has found he's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
With him are other physicians -- military regulations prohibit him from saying 
how many -- plucked out of their communities to fill in for Navy doctors 
ordered elsewhere since the U.S. decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We've developed an esprit de corps," Greif said. "We're making the best of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part we are holding up. Our families are holding up well." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife recently celebrated their 15th anniversary, apart. It would 
have cost too much for Greif to fly home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a question of can we afford it. If I can find a good enough fare 
and we can be sure we have enough money to pay all the bills, we will take a 
few days off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the call-ups, the family was talking of moving into a bigger house. Now, 
Greif says, "we'll be very grateful to stay in the one we're in." 
</P>
<P>
Greif says his financial situation is "relatively good" compared to other 
reservist physicians there, but he has lost more than 75% of his monthly income 
with the activation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one big worry we have," he said. "Every night we sit and joke about 
it, but it's not very funny at all." 
</P>
<P>
Back in San Pedro, Howard Morris' mother, Gayle, flew in from Meeker to join 
her in-laws and help Terri. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't write her son many letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done my share," Gayle said, alluding to the correspondence she sent 
Howard's father -- "a loudmouth drill instructor," she calls him -- when he was 
in the Marines. The day Howard started kindergarten, his father was in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
When Howard told her he was going to the Gulf last month, his mother didn't 
have much reaction. "Take care of yourself," she said, and then hung up the 
phone and went back to cooking fried potatoes and eggs for her husband's 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
But when Gayle smoked a cigarette the other night, talking about Howard, her 
hand trembled. "I'd be a nervous wreck if I thought about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have good examples to follow," Terri said. 
</P>
<P>
Terri was also referring to her own mother, who years ago followed R.T. from 
Great Bend, Kan., to West Bend, Wis., as he laid pipe. It was a life a lot like 
in the military, Carol said, full of packing boxes and unfriendly neighbors and 
loneliness. They finally settled on a dairy farm in Meeker. 
</P>
<P>
When Terri was born, R.T. made Carol a promise: "Mammie, she's going to have 
all the pretty clothes she wants." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents said they spoiled Terri so much she often got out of milking the 
cows, and once her grandfather even let her wear her grandmother's girdle to 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Now Carol and R.T. feel helpless. Loving won't cure Terri's illness or solve 
the crisis overseas or bring Howard back. 
</P>
<P>
So they did all they could this month during their visit. They played and read 
with the girls. The women cooked dinners and cleaned the garage. R.T. laid a 
new carpet in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of times at night they sang hymns around the piano. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid $1,000 for that piano and I haven't got 10 cents worth yet," R.T. 
grumbled in jest when Terri said she didn't feel well enough. Sometimes her 
muscle spasms get so bad she can't play. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 26, the Flowers boarded a bus home to Meeker. 
</P>
<P>
Terri and the girls cried a little when they left. But her family will be fine, 
Terri said. They're used to saying goodby.

PURCHASE OF LAGUNA CANYON IS APPROVED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BEACH CITY'S COUNCIL OKS $78 MILLION TO PRESERVE THE SOUTHLAND'S 
LAST UNDEVELOPED COASTAL CANYON. VOTERS MUST PASS A $20-MILLION BOND ISSUE, THE 
KEY TO THE PLAN.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several days of intense negotiations and soul searching, the City Council 
here voted unanimously Sunday to buy 2,150 acres in Laguna Canyon for $78 
million and commit the city to an unprecedented land conservation plan that 
protects Southern California's last undeveloped coastal canyon. 
</P>
<P>
By agreeing to purchase the Laguna Laurel tract from the Irvine Co. over a 
five-year period, the city is effectively ending a proposed 3,200-unit 
development in order to preserve the canyon as open space. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not an easy decision because it represents a serious commitment on the 
part of the people of the city and the people of the county to come up with a 
significant amount of money," Mayor Lida Lenney said. "But the feeling of the 
council is that this property is worth it and we very much appreciate the kind 
of help we had from the Irvine Co. in reaching this kind of agreement, and we 
are ready to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
The anchor for the city's purchase plan is a $20-million bond issue on the Nov. 
6 ballot that will require the approval of two-thirds of Laguna Beach voters. 
Although citizens have previously demonstrated their strong sentiments in favor 
of saving the picturesque canyon from development, city officials were 
hard-pressed to come up with a viable financing plan that would meet voters' 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know of any city that has taken on the responsibility of using its 
good faith and credit to purchase open space," Irvine Co. Senior Vice President 
Gary Hunt said after the final negotiating session Sunday. "There's no question 
in my mind that this is a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Freeman, who was hired by both sides to forge a compromise, said the pact 
is also "a milestone in terms of dispute resolution involving historically 
contentious interests." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists bitterly battled the company for more than a decade to 
protect the pristine landscape of rolling pasture, rugged cliffs and 
increasingly rare coastal sage habitat that is home to many threatened wildlife 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities such as actresses Bette Midler and Julie Harris joined the effort 
to save the canyon and local artists held "paint-ins" to protest planned 
destruction of the scenery. Others volunteered as body blocks to bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
In a show of solidarity last November, more than 7,000 placard-carrying 
protesters -- estimates range as high as 8,500 -- converged on winding Laguna 
Canyon Road to denounce the Irvine Co. and its proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a win-win for everybody," Carolyn Wood, president of the Laguna Canyon 
Conservancy, said after Sunday's final negotiating session. 
</P>
<P>
Although a tentative agreement had been reached last week by the Laguna Laurel 
Advisory Group -- which represents the city, the developer and 
environmentalists -- tempers flared later when the city pressed for more 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said delicate negotiations during the final 48 hours of talks helped 
seal the agreement that was unanimously approved during a special closed-door 
session of the council and immediately ratified by the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
The final pact is similar to the agreement hammered out by the advisory group 
last Tuesday. The $78-million price tag for the land, which was independently 
appraised at $105 million, remained unchanged. The five-year payment schedule 
of $33 million, $3 million, $4 million, $5 million and $33 million -- with the 
first payment due next June -- also remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
However, an added feature gives the city the option of paying up to $40 million 
in the first year in order to purchase all of the Laguna Laurel property on the 
west side of Laguna Canyon Road, or slightly more than 90% of the project site, 
which includes some of the most environmentally sensitive land. 
</P>
<P>
Once the city's payments reach $45 million, it will also acquire the property's 
three lakes -- the only natural lakes in Orange County.

TRAIN DERAILS IN MT. WASHINGTON

<P>
A freight train derailed today and one of the cars plowed into an apartment 
building, but no injuries were reported in the third Southern California train 
derailment in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve cars of the freight train derailed just after 10 a.m. in the Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Washington neighborhood near the Pasadena Freeway, city Fire Department 
spokesman Pat Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the derailment was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"One of those freight cars did hit an apartment building," he said. "There were 
no injuries reported from that apartment building being hit." 
</P>
<P>
One of the cars also carried an unidentified hazardous material, but no leaks 
were found, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The derailment was the third in Southern California in the last month. Fourteen 
runaway railroad cars collided with a locomotive in Pico Rivera on Sept. 9, and 
about two weeks later, a boxcar loaded with Navy munitions jumped the tracks in 
Westminster. No one was injured in either derailment.

2 PRESUMED DROWNED AT CASTAIC

<TEXT>
<P>
A 50-year-old man and boy, 17, both from Pasadena, are presumed drowned in 
Castaic Lake after their rented fishing boat was swamped Sunday afternoon, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said today. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the two were not released pending notification of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men in the boat were saved by county lifeguards, who sped to the 
scene at 4:25 p.m. in boats, arriving less than five minutes after the incident 
was reported, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The four were fishing on upper Castaic Lake, where power boating is popular. 
Deputies would not release the names of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The boat apparently hit a wave and was swamped. The missing are presumed 
drowned in an area of the lake where water is more than 200 feet deep. Divers 
are unable to search in the depths and no search for the bodies was planned 
this morning, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters repeatedly flew over the site and lifeguard boats searched the 
area, but the two missing men were not found. The incident has been ruled an 
accident by sheriff's investigators.

Forbes magazine released its annual list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people 
today, spelling out what some have suspected with glee for months: Donald Trump 
has hit very hard times, and he's not the only high-flier who crashed with the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
While the flashy developer was dropped right off the Forbes 400 list, 
Metromedia founder John Kluge grew even richer. 
</P>
<P>
The rags-to-riches German expanded his fortune by $400 million, to a staggering 
$5.6 billion, enough to retain his crown as the richest of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the top 400 saw their net worth dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the great 1980s credit binge, capital values almost everywhere 
are being marked down. Just as homeowners feel less wealthy than a year ago, so 
do most of the nations' rich," the magazine said. "In 1990 the rich have been 
getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump is the most noteworthy loser," it said. "Once a billionaire, Trump's net 
worth may actually have dropped to zero." 
</P>
<P>
Another loser is Merv Griffin, whose Resorts International, which owns the 
struggling casino next door to Trump's struggling Taj Mahal, went bankrupt.

The men sang "Happy Birthday" to Kaye Akers, wife of astronaut Tom Akers. In

WORK ON TRANSPLANTS NETS 2 AMERICANS A NOBEL

<P>
Two Americans -- one who performed the first successful kidney transplant and 
one who pioneered bone marrow transplants -- won the Nobel Prize in medicine 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Murray, 71, discovered how to master the problem of organ rejection 
and, in 1954, made the first successful organ transplant, a kidney from one 
identical twin to another that functioned for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
The work of E. Donnall Thomas, 70, lessened the severe reaction that bone 
marrow transplants can cause in the recipients. His work led to a cure for 
leukemia in 50% of cases, and in 80% of childhood cases. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's laureates paved the way for transplantation in man," said the 
award citation from the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplants are now used to treat a variety of cancers and 
inherited diseases, and researchers are investigating their potential use in 
AIDS and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The award citation said Murray "pioneered transplantation of kidneys obtained 
from deceased persons. . . . The field was then open for transplantation of 
other organs, such as liver, pancreas and heart." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who is affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, was in 
San Francisco for a medical conference when he heard he had won. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about this that's marvelous is that Don and I both were in Brigham 
Hospital together," said Murray, a native of Milford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a resident in medicine, and I was a resident in surgery. This was after 
World War II. We both started working in transplants together, but from 
different angles. It's marvelous to share it with him." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said this morning from his home in Bellevue, Wash., that he had always 
thought his work was too clinical to win the prize. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 142 medicine prizes since the award was first given in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have dominated the prize, winning or sharing it 69 times.

SOVIETS DETAIN GREENPEACE PROTEST SHIP

The Soviet coast guard fired warning shots at a Greenpeace ship today, detained 
the vessel carrying anti-nuclear activists and accused it of violating the 
Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict occurred after the MV Greenpeace, a 190-foot converted salvage tug 
ship, sailed into Soviet waters in the Barents Sea to protest nuclear testing 
at the Novaya Zemlya archipelago north of the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Four of 28 Greenpeace activists on the vessel left the ship in rubber dinghies 
early today, several hours before it was boarded by coast guard officers, and 
landed on one of the islands near the Soviet nuclear test site, the 
environmental organization's Copenhagen office said. The four activists' fate 
was not known. 
</P>
<P>
A Greenpeace representative in Denmark said that Andrei Zolotkov, a member of 
the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, and six local Soviet politicians and 
journalists were aboard the environmental group's boat when it was detained by 
the coast guard. 
</P>
<P>
Tass news agency quoted the KGB intelligence agency as saying that the 
Greenpeace vessel was detained "for deliberate violation of the state border of 
the U.S.S.R., failure to obey border authorities, landing people at unpermitted 
places and an attempt to enter an area closed to navigation." 
</P>
<P>
The vessel was flying Dutch flags when it was detained off Novaya Zemlya, Tass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to detain the Greenpeace ship, border guards had to fire warning 
shots," the KGB said. "The ship will soon be escorted to the Kola Gulf, where 
an inquiry will take place." 
</P>
<P>
The coast guard on Sept. 21 briefly detained a Norwegian research ship taking 
water samples in the same area, seven miles off the main Novaya Zemlya island, 
which is the Soviet Union's No. 2 nuclear test site and has been inhabited only 
by Soviet military personnel since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace representatives said the protest in Soviet waters was part of the 
group's "Let's Disarm the Sea" campaign.

South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jung challenged the government by 
starting a hunger strike today, a move President Roh Tae Woo said will increase 
political and social instability. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Kim, for three decades South Korea's best known opposition 
politician, began his fast this morning to regain support for his lagging 
political program. 
</P>
<P>
Kim demanded the government hold local elections, overhaul the Defense Security 
Agency and scrap plans to change South Korea's government from a presidential 
to a British-style cabinet system. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts and diplomats said South Koreans had become disenchanted with the 
country's seemingly endless squabbling, while dazzled by government diplomatic 
successes and renewed dialogue with North Korea.

BRITISH POUND SOARS AS IT ENTERS EC'S CURRENCY GRID

The British pound and London's stock market soared today as sterling formally 
entered the European currency float after years of resistance from British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
The pound began trading within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism early in 
London after an agreement was clinched with the rest of the 12-nation European 
Community over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Britain announced Friday it was dropping its longstanding opposition to joining 
the EC's semi-fixed currency grid. The pound surged as a result, with buying 
fever spreading to the stock market today. 
</P>
<P>
Trading volume for the day soared to 1.08 billion shares, an all-time high, 
helped by an estimated 300 million shares at the opening that included leftover 
orders from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A London Stock Exchange spokeswoman said the highest daily volume recorded was 
997.3 million shares on July 9, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember the last time we turned over 500 million shares, let alone 
900 million," one dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 top shares, or "Footsie" as it 
is called, ended 57.7 points higher at 2,201.6. 
</P>
<P>
The pound rose as high as 3.05 German marks in a spectacular rally that brought 
it up 10 pfennigs since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said economic history was made when trading screens flashed the "go" 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
This took the form of an announcement this morning by the Bank of England of 
the rates at which the pound -- once the world's leading currency in Britain's 
imperial heyday -- is aligned to the German mark. It is set at 2.95 marks and 
may fluctuate in a band between 2.7780 and 3.1320. 
</P>
<P>
After rising just above 3.05 marks, the pound eased to around 3.03. That was 
well within its limits, but some analysts thought it might go higher during the 
week.

Extra production by OPEC members in September made up for 3 million of the

Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced an

<P>
In July, the cartel was producing 23.5 million barrels a day.

Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and the world embargo on exports from those 
two major producers, cut 4 million barrels a day from OPEC quota exports.

The Middle East Economic Survey said that in September, the increased 
production came from Saudi Arabia, with an extra 2.1 million barrels a day;

The new united Germany is using every available plane to send home Third World 
workers hired by the east's former Communist leaders, officials said today.

<P>
More than 2,000 unwanted Mozambican and Vietnamese workers are returning home 
every week on charter planes from Berlin's Schoenefeld airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't got enough planes to cope and are looking for more," said 
Manfred Knack, head of charter sales at Interflug, the flag carrier of the 
former East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
About 85,000 workers came to East Germany from socialist Third World countries 
under bilateral accords. Germany, which unified last week, has ended the 
agreements, leaving it up to individual companies how long they want to keep on 
foreign workers. 
</P>
<P>
Germany is offering $2,000 and a flight home to foreign workers, many of whom 
have suffered racial attacks as scapegoats for East Germany's economic 
collapse.

Was any offense lost with the NFL's decision to speed up games? 
</P>
<P>
Not by Sunday's results, when even Pittsburgh scored an offensive touchdown. In 
fact, the Steelers scored four of them, three in a 17-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
After an average of 39 points per game over the first four weeks -- two fewer 
than for the 1989 season -- almost 49 points per game were scored in 11 
contests Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, defense and special teams kicked in, especially in Buffalo, where the 
Bills scored 17 fourth-quarter points with defense and special teams in their 
38-24 victory over the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
But in Anaheim, the Bengals and Rams combined for 1,040 yards as Cincinnati 
won, 34-31, in overtime. (Story, C1.) Boomer Esiason threw for 471 yards and 
Jim Everett had 372, making Chris Miller's career best 366 yards for Atlanta 
only the third-best performance of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Five receivers -- three Bengals and two Rams -- had more than 100 yards 
receiving. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the Falcons beat the Saints, 28-27, in a game in which there were 
just three punts. Atlanta didn't punt until the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the Steelers, who finally scored an offensive touchdown after 
19 quarters, then added three more in a 36-14 victory over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
INCONCLUSIVE: This was the first week in which teams that had a week off 
resumed play. The results were . . . inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the teams played each other, with Atlanta beating New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
But both the Rams and 49ers got off to slow starts, San Francisco falling 
behind before winning, 24-21, in Houston. The Rams fell behind 21-0 against the 
Bengals -- who had lost Monday night and spent the week in Seattle -- before 
rallying to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams lost anyway, 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think the bye was a factor," said Rams quarterback Jim Everett. 
"I still look at it as a positive. We had some guys injured who came back and 
played very well, although we did start out a little slower than we would have 
liked to." 
</P>
<P>
MOTIVATOR GONE: The Bills kept the Raiders from finally fulfilling their wish. 
That is, Art Shell was motivating his team by telling them "people think we're 
the worst 3-0 team in the league," then "people think we're the worst 4-0 team 
in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Had they held their 10-point fourth-quarter lead Sunday night, they would have 
been the worst 5-0 team in the league because they would have been the only one 
-- the 49ers (4-0) were off a week ago and the Giants (4-0) were off Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
HE'S BACK . . . : After becoming the star of the pregame shows with his almost 
flawless performance this season, Kansas City's Steve DeBerg had a game that 
showed why he's floated from Dallas to San Francisco to Denver to Tampa Bay to 
Kansas City since 1977. In the Chiefs' 23-19 loss to the Colts, he threw his 
first three interceptions of the season and was 16 of 36 for 212 yards. 
</P>
<P>
AND HE'S BACK . . . : Seattle's Derrick Fenner was held to two touchdowns as 
the Seahawks beat New England, 33-20. That gives him eight in his last three 
games.

NFL UNION SUGGESTS BAR ON ALL MEDIA

The NFL players union today suggested that all members of the news media, male 
and female, be barred from locker rooms and that separate interview areas be 
set up to assure privacy for the players. 
</P>
<P>
"NFL players should be afforded absolute privacy in their locker rooms," Gene 
Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., said in a statement from 
his union's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"They should not be expected or required to participate in media interviews 
unless fully clothed." 
</P>
<P>
His statement follows two recent incidents involving female sports writers 
covering NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson alleged that on Sept. 17 several Patriot 
players approached her while they were naked in an attempt to embarrass her 
with lewd suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche barred USA Today's Denise Tom from entering 
his team's locker room last Monday. Wyche was fined 1/17th of his salary by the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw acknowledged that women reporters must have the same access to players 
as male reporters. As a possible solution, he suggested a "separate area, 
removed from the locker room, where all players would be available on an equal 
basis to all accredited media, male or female."

GILL'S AGENT ACCUSES HORNET VP OF ABUSE

Kendall Gill's agent has sent a letter to the NBA office, accusing Charlotte 
Hornets Vice President Allan Bristow of physically abusing him last week, a 
Charlotte newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Arn Tellem, the agent, asked the league to fine, suspend or terminate Bristow 
after an incident in Bristow's office, Hornets owner George Shinn said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tellem, of Los Angeles, declined comment and Bristow refused to discuss details 
of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
But Shinn told The Charlotte Observer each man's version of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Tellem) said that Allan forced him up against the wall, choked him," Shinn 
said. "Allan said Arn started yelling at him, and they got in each other's 
faces. (Bristow) said, 'I did push my finger in front of his chest.' That's no 
physical abuse. Geez, Allan drove him to the airport (afterward)." 
</P>
<P>
Tellem was treated by his doctor in Los Angeles for a sprained neck, according 
to a story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Tellem declined comment, saying he does not want to disrupt negotiations that 
are close to getting Gill, the Hornets' first-round pick, signed. Shinn said 
the Hornets have made an offer of $1.8 million per season, plus incentives that 
could raise Gill's salary above $2 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
Due to Tellem's claim, Bristow has removed himself as lead negotiator for the 
Hornets on Gill, a 6-foot-5 guard from Illinois. Hornets Vice President Spencer 
Stolpen has replaced Bristow in that role. 
</P>
<P>
"We both acted unprofessionally," Bristow said.

CHICAGO BEARS PICK WAUKEGAN PARK FOR WINTER TRAINING SITE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Bears have picked a Waukegan office and business park as the site 
of their cold-weather training facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears plan to lease the land at $1 a year and erect an inflatable temporary 
facility, said Patrick Fox, vice president and project manager of Amli 
Development, which owns the site. 
</P>
<P>
It will be 80 yards long, 60 yards wide and about 65 feet high, he said, with 
artificial turf and a constant temperature about 60 degrees. It should be 
available for use by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is for two years, Fox said, with an option for a third. His long-term 
goal is to have the Bears build a permanent practice facility and headquarters 
at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears accelerated their search for a cold-weather facility in August when 
players staged a protest during a rainy pre-season practice at Bear 
headquarters at Lake Forest. In the past, the team has suffered at Lake Forest 
with poor weather and frozen turf as the season wore on.

IBRAHIM'S GLIMPSE PAST APARTHEID; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: JAZZ PIANIST LEADING EXILED MUSICIANS BACK HOME TO PERFORM. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each time Abdullah Ibrahim sits down at the piano to play jazz, his South 
African audience gets a glimpse of life beyond apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The sight -- familiar enough in the clubs of New York -- of the tall, willowy 
figure dressed in flowing white robes has been denied them for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other South African musicians, writers and artists, Ibrahim, better 
known here as Dollar Brand, left the land of his birth to escape the apartheid 
laws that discriminated against him because of the color of his skin. 
</P>
<P>
Now that apartheid is finally crumbling he is back, the first of a flood of 
returning musicians to perform at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed this among the musicians, and everyone agreed it was the right 
time to come," he told a news conference last month, after returning to South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he spoke, another of South Africa's famous sons, jazz trumpeter Hugh 
Masekela, arrived in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Ibrahim, who said he was here to pave the way for a mass concert of exiled 
musicians in November, has upset some anti-apartheid activists with his series 
of sell-out concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite reforms set in motion by President Frederik W. de Klerk, a cultural 
boycott against Pretoria is still in place, and some people felt Ibrahim should 
have waited for the November event. 
</P>
<P>
The ebullient Ibrahim, who has the blessing of the African National Congress, 
dismissed the controversy as a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to be known as Africa's best pianist," said ANC information chief 
Pallo Jordan, himself a former exile and a friend of Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's more modest now," he added with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, 56, admits that going into exile was as much a career move as a 
political one. 
</P>
<P>
"Apartheid made it virtually impossible to function as a creative artist. It 
was a career move. We had to leave the country because of apartheid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His band, the Jazz Epistles, formed with Masekela and saxophonist Kippie 
Moeketsi, had hit the top of the domestic market by the time the trio went 
abroad in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
They sought sanctuary in Switzerland from the turmoil that erupted at home 
after police killed 69 blacks in Sharpeville township in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
They got a crucial break at a concert in Zurich. Duke Ellington was in the 
audience, and he liked them so much that he sponsored their first American 
album -- "Duke Ellington Presents the Dollar Brand Trio." 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim's original name was Adolphus Brand, but he picked up the nickname 
Dollar from the black American seamen who sold him jazz records when they 
docked in his native Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
At Ellington's urging, he went to the United States in 1965. There he involved 
himself with the free, or abstract, jazz scene, playing with musicians such as 
John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he converted to Islam, changing his name to Abdullah 
Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through all of this stuff -- yoga, Buddhism. . . . For me it landed 
with Islam, especially because of its accessibility in the Cape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, he formed a seven-piece ensemble called Ekaya, which means 
home in several southern African languages. The group dedicated its work to the 
people of South Africa living under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim believes he can contribute to a new South Africa by passing on to black 
musicians the marketing skills he has learned abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important skills are networking skills, so that musicians can learn 
to sell their own songs."

</P>
<P>
She said she was not leaving because of any ill feelings.

"It's harder to take the risk and not to stay," she said. "I'm only (leaving) 
because the play has run a long run, and I want to know who else is out there I 
can play." 
</P>
<P>
"It has enhanced this year for me, knowing that this is the last time to play 
Grace," she said. "It made Grace more exciting to me."

Dey said her plans include making two movies through her own production 
company, one of them about children.

NEWBORN ACTOR LIKES BIGGER SOAPBOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panamanian lawyer-turned-musician Ruben Blades, who appears in "Mo' Better 
Blues," "The Two Jakes" and "The Lemon Sisters," swears he's not abandoning 
music, just looking for a platform for social comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard graduate and former Panama City banker is far from a Big Screen 
Adonis of Tom Selleck proportions. He's less than medium height. His black hair 
is receding. But he is bright. He is talented. He is ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
Blades' Afro-Cuban music has led to a dozen record album hits, some going gold, 
but he's now moving into a movie career that already includes roles in "The 
Last Flight," "Fatal Beauty," "Crossover Dreams" and "The Milagro Beanfield 
War." 
</P>
<P>
Blades is not abandoning music, but he has something to say about social 
conditions and racial concepts that he feels movies will enable him to project. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a possibility to develop further in films what I have already started 
in music," he said. "I write my own material, making myself a protagonist of 
other people's stories. 
</P>
<P>
"In films I accept a role as presented by other people and take it elsewhere, a 
step further. (But) I love the beauty, fullness and immediacy of music. I do 
not plan to give it up for acting. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is universal. When I perform in concert audiences are integrated, 
racially and culturally mixed. The response comes from the music regardless of 
the language of the lyrics. It makes the audience react." 
</P>
<P>
Blades is aware the transition from music to acting isn't easy. Sinatra, 
Presley, Streisand, the Beatles, Sting, Dean Martin, Doris Day and others have 
made the changeover with varying degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
And he knows he is further handicapped in Hollywood movies because he is 
foreign-born. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the film industry find it difficult to trust the responsibility of a 
role to someone who isn't an Anglo and at the same time someone they do not 
perceive as an actor but as a musician," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Desi Arnaz was a leading man in TV, a Latino who attracted Anglo support at a 
time when racism was at its worst in the 1950s. Here was a Latino married to a 
beautiful Anglo. Nobody complained that Desi was a foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
"Desi as a Latino wasn't a thief, a dope dealer or a welfare chiseler. Since 
Desi, there hasn't been a Latino figure accepted in TV or films as a leading 
man. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing comedy in films, which is a strong medium for making social 
comment. Chaplin and others have used it." 
</P>
<P>
Blades, who moved from New York to Hollywood four years ago, shuns music in his 
movies. He says roles that include music are usually lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
"I've turned down parts that would require me to sing," he said. "I want to 
create a different image. I hope to play parts with no ethnic implications. A 
man is a man. An actor should be able to play a role without racial 
identification."
