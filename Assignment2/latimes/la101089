Alexander Mauro, 68, a Rockefeller University biophysicist who helped develop 
the radio frequency cardiac pacemaker. The New Haven, Conn., native stayed in 
his hometown to receive a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1942 and 
his doctorate in biophysics in 1950. He joined the faculty of the Yale School 
of Medicine in 1951, starting a collaboration with cardiac surgeon William W. 
L. Glenn. In 1958, their work led to development of the radio frequency cardiac 
pacemaker, which was designed for patients with Stokes-Adams disease -- a 
condition marked by a slow, irregular pulse. A year later Mauro left Yale to 
become a biophysics professor at Rockefeller University, where he specialized 
in work on cell membranes. He wrote or co-authored almost 100 scholarly 
publications in his career. In New York on Friday of cancer.

In an act of uncharacteristic moderation for politicians, the Los Angeles City 
Council voted in February to cut the speaking time of members on issues from 
five minutes to three. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the council will consider a motion by members Zev Yaroslavsky and Mike 
Woo to extend the yapping limit back to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpected re-evaluation? 
</P>
<P>
Not really. After all, the council will soon begin televising its meetings. 
</P>
<P>
You may remember keye/donna/pearlstein as the West Los Angeles firm that 
lampooned the myriad sponsorships of the 1984 Olympics by hanging a banner that 
proclaimed: "Official Advertising Agency of Olympic Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Now the company has a comment on another matter: Outside its headquarters, the 
city has ripped up a small patch of grass and trees so that it can install a 
right-hand turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty upset about it so we asked our people to come up with some 
entries (for the banner)," said Paul Keye, chairman of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestions included: "There Used To Be a Tree Here," "Welcome to Life in 
the Turn Lane," and "Another Urban Uglification Project." 
</P>
<P>
The agency settled on: "Asphalt 1. Trees 0." 
</P>
<P>
Owing to the presence of the ocean a few hundred feet away, jury candidates in 
the assembly room of the Long Beach Courthouse receive some unusual 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not bring your beach wear, jurors," one recent group was told. "Do not wear 
your swimming suits. This is not a beach resort. This is a court. You cannot 
wear shorts. I have had jurors wear shorts and claim they were not shorts. We 
all know what shorts are." 
</P>
<P>
You might feel a few pains in your stomach just from reading this, but Pi Sigma 
Epsilon fraternity of Cal Poly Pomona intends to build the world's largest 
burrito Thursday, a projected 185-footer. That's around 200,000 calories or so 
(assuming you don't use guacamole). 
</P>
<P>
Once the beef and beans and lettuce and tomatoes and salsa monster is put 
together, it will be cut into six-inch slices to raise funds for charitable 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
After the diners have finished, some of them might feel like taking a snooze in 
the world's largest bed, which was recently constructed by the Acme Mattress 
Factory of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Acme just learned that its 25-by-40-foot work of art will be cited in the 1990 
edition of the Bible of crazies, the Guinness Book of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
But the honored piece of furniture isn't on display in the Acme showroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we dismantled it," said co-owner Ellen Boles. "It took up too much space."

THEODORE FOLSOM, OCEANOGRAPHER AT SCRIPPS, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theodore Robert Folsom, 82, an oceanographer and physicist associated with 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography for three decades, died Friday at Parkside 
Special Care Center in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Folsom, a native of San Diego, pioneered the development of methods for 
tracking radioactive contaminants in the ocean. He is the author of many papers 
on that and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
Folsom began his affiliation with Scripps in 1952, when he received his Ph.D. 
from the institution. He remained on the Scripps staff until his retirement in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
Folsom graduated from San Diego High School and received undergraduate and 
master's degrees from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 
Before joining Scripps, he conducted research at Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Murtrie Folsom, was one of the early developers of Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Folsom is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Edith, and his daughter, 
Polly Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be private, and it is requested that, in lieu of flowers, 
donations be made to the Alzheimer's Society of San Diego.

LAWYER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front-page story, "Top Lawyers Get $400 an Hour as Fees, Salaries Rise" by 
Ted Rohrlich (Sept. 18) may leave some readers with the impression that all 
lawyers are commanding fees in the range presented by the story's headline. 
</P>
<P>
While the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. does not object to any of the facts 
cited in Rohrlich's report, the association believes that it is just as 
important to let the public know that most attorneys do not earn these kinds of 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The association believes it is important to note, while reporting on the 
salaries of the highest paid lawyers, that the number of lawyers who earn in 
excess of $100,000 a year constitute a very small minority of those in 
practice. The great majority of lawyers work in offices of 10 or fewer 
attorneys, and a sizable portion work as sole practitioners representing 
individuals with relatively small, but nonetheless real problems. 
</P>
<P>
The association hopes to dissuade readers of The Times story from painting all 
lawyers with the same broad $400-an-hour brush. Those individuals have reached 
a pinnacle of success enjoyed by few, and certainly do not represent the 
majority of lawyers in our country.

CHIROPRACTORS

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Turf Battle Over Sports Physicals," Metro, Oct. 2: 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Los Angeles County Medical Society, Dr. Charles McElwee's 
statements are quite unfortunate. "They are not physicians and they shouldn't 
be practicing medicine. If (a patient) wants a true history and physical exam, 
they cannot get it from a chiropractor." 
</P>
<P>
The "big lie" continues as McElwee attempts to persuade the public that 
inquiry, observation and deduction, the quintessential elements in 
history-taking and examination, are the sole purview of his profession. 
</P>
<P>
Chiropractors do not practice medicine as the public regards it, but they do 
practice fair, rational and objective thinking. Certainly qualified doctors of 
chiropractic are capable of performing athletic exams as are "qualified" 
doctors of medicine.

PROGRESS FOR WORKERS' COMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issues in the 1989 debate over workers' compensation reform were similar to 
the legislative tangle in recent years over the high cost of insurance. The 
Legislature's inability to negotiate a middle ground between the insurance 
companies and lawyers resulted in deadlock that led to competing ballot 
initiatives in the 1988 election. Even with the passage of Proposition 103, the 
insurance dilemma remains unresolved. But in the case of workers' compensation, 
the lawmakers refused to give up, even after it became apparent that all the 
goals of a sound, long-range reform program could not be achieved this year. 
</P>
<P>
Largely due to the tireless efforts of Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles), California no longer will be burdened with what many consider one of 
the nation's worst programs for compensating employees who suffer work-related 
injury or disability. The legislation, recently signed into law by Gov. George 
Deukmejian, falls short of making the $8-billion California system the best, 
but Margolin said the two-bill package at least will put a crumbling, 
disrespected program back on its feet. Efforts to complete the job must 
continue in future legislative sessions. 
</P>
<P>
California has had an extremely costly program, but one that paid a maximum 
benefit of only $224 a week since 1983. For the past seven years, the governor 
has insisted on reforms before increasing benefits. One goal of the 1989 
legislation had been to double the top payment, with the additional outlay to 
be financed by reforms that would cut program costs. The weekly maximum will 
increase by just 50% by 1991. The measures will limit an injured worker's 
ability to shop for a doctor who would certify him for maximum benefits. Claim 
processing will be more efficient. There will be a tougher test to collect 
compensation for alleged stress-related disability and more emphasis on 
vocational rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Like the insurance debate, the workers' compensation issue pitted insurance 
companies against attorneys, but also involved a coalition of business, 
industry and labor on one side and high-stress professions such as law 
enforcement on the other. Further deadlock probably would have led to opposing 
ballot initiatives -- none of which would have provided a balanced reform. 
California is fortunate that Margolin and his colleagues did not give up on 
workers' compensation reform this year, even though no party had a chance to 
get all it wanted. The state will benefit further if the Legislature can 
complete the job in the next year or so.

<TEXT>
<P>
Electro Rent Corp. said its fiscal first-quarter net income fell 22% from a 
year earlier, to $1.7 million from $2.2 million, and its sales dropped to $26.7 
million from $29.4 million.

Van Nuys-based Electro Rent attributed the lower results to a decrease in sales 
of used electronic test equipment.

Producer Ted Hartley and actress Dina Merrill have been flooded with more than 
6,000 entries for a screenwriting competition they have established in the 
Soviet Union. The Hartley/Merrill Prize, which includes $10,000 and the promise 
of Writers Guild of America minimum if the screenplay is produced in this 
country, was created to encourage interchange between Soviet and American 
writers and film makers. The Writers Guild and the U.S.S.R. Screenwriters' 
Guild are co-sponsors of the award. The competition winner will pick up the 
prize at a televised ceremony in Moscow in May. ALEENE MacMINN

Mega-star Michael Jackson will be given a commemorative plaque by his 
sixth-grade teacher, Laura Gerson, on Wednesday during dedication ceremonies 
for the newly refurbished auditorium that will bear his name at Gardner Street 
Elementary School in Hollywood. Jackson attended sixth grade at the school in 
1969-70. Principal Jeff Sweeney says the tribute to Jackson was the brainchild 
of a group of Gardner parents who helped spearhead an extensive, three-year 
renovation project of the school's main building, where the auditorium is 
located. ALEENE MacMINN

Orange County Performing Arts Center subscribers who bought tickets expecting 
to see Sarah Brightman starring in "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber" will now 
get what they paid for. Under the original six-day, eight-performance schedule, 
alternate soloists would have taken the soprano's place at weekend matinees. 
Now, Brightman will sing at 12 performances, including four added 
non-subscription dates, over 12 days, Nov. 7-18. Brightman, who is married to 
Lloyd Webber, premiered the role of Christine in the London and New York 
productions of her husband's "The Phantom of the Opera." She and others will 
sing excerpts from a number of his musicals. ALEENE MacMINN

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa of Poland will visit the United States, Canada 
and Venezuela next month, meeting with trade union and political leaders and 
addressing a joint session of Congress. The Nov. 12-20 trip, Walesa's first to 
North America, will include an outdoor rally at City Hall in Chicago, a city 
with an ethnic Polish population second only to Warsaw. Walesa, 46, will 
address Congress on Nov. 15. He has said he will remind U.S. lawmakers of 
Poland's contributions to American independence since the Revolutionary War and 
plead for U.S. support for his country.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party begins its annual 
conference today with its popularity at an eight-year low, the economy in 
trouble and public rumblings that her free-market revolution has gone too far. 
For the 63-year-old British leader, the four-day meeting in the north England 
resort of Blackpool is shaping up as one of the most difficult since she won 
power a decade ago. New opinion polls show the Conservatives 7 to 11 percentage 
points behind the socialist Labor Party, with many voters apparently opposed to 
several of Thatcher's key programs, including a new property tax.

Police and security officers appeared in force at the Florida Capitol in 
Tallahassee as the city braced itself for a special legislative session on 
abortion and several large demonstrations. The Florida Legislature is scheduled 
to convene this afternoon. Authorities have estimated between 15,000 and 
100,000 protesters on both sides of the abortion issue will turn out for the 
demonstrations. Security was also tight at the Governor's Mansion several 
blocks north of the Capitol, where abortion rights advocates planned to picket 
for an hour every night through Friday, when the special session is scheduled 
to end. The special session has drawn national attention, because it is the 
first to be called on the abortion issue since the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 
ruling on a Missouri law gave states the right to restrict abortion.

The widow of a man who was shot to death Sept. 21 on a Santa Barbara-area beach 
was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport, police said. Diana 
Bogdanoff, 41, was taken into custody for investigation of the shooting death 
of Phillip Bogdanoff, 49, in a secluded cove at El Capitan State Beach, an area 
used by nudists. Diana Bogdanoff's arrest came a day after sheriff's deputies 
arrested her daughter, Stephanie Joy Allen, 18, and the young woman's 
boyfriend, Brian Keith Stafford, 21, in Bakersfield. Authorities said they were 
looking for a second man as a suspect. Initially, the murder of Bogdanoff, who 
was shot twice in the head, was reported as a random act of violence. No motive 
was offered after the arrests.

Oakland police are playing down speculation that a serial killer is stalking 
area prostitutes. But the slayings of six women in little more than two months 
have spread fear on the streets. "We're all a little scared," said Renee 
Jackson, who said she has worked the streets for 11 years, "but not scared 
enough, because we're still out here." Police Capt. Jim Hahn said it was too 
early to talk about a serial killer, pointing out that about 10 prostitutes are 
killed in the city each year. Still, he admits that six deaths in such a short 
time is unusual, and the possibility of a single killer is not being ruled out.

A transformer caught fire at the Shearon Harris nuclear power plant near 
Raleigh, N.C., and was brought under control, officials said. No injuries were 
reported. Officials said that the incident posed no apparent danger to 
residents and that no evacuations were ordered. The fire apparently was started 
by a hydrogen leak in a transformer and did not threaten the plant's nuclear 
operations, said a spokeswoman for Carolina Power and Light Co., which owns the 
facility. The nuclear generator was shut down automatically when the 
transformer fire started. Hydrogen is used to cool the generator.

A real estate investment firm will close and absorb a $675,000 loss rather than 
continue an association with its manager -- a former federal housing official 
linked to recent scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
New York Newsday reported. Eagle Capital Ltd. is shutting down, but Joseph 
Monticciolo, former New York regional administrator for HUD, will go to work at 
other companies of the firm's founder, the newspaper quoted Eagle's lawyer as 
saying. Monticciolo, HUD regional administrator from 1981 to 1988, testified in 
July before a House subcommittee that he earmarked large sums of HUD money for 
developers who later became partners at Eagle Capital.

workers. Kenney and representatives of other unions belonging to the council 
met for several hours with leaders of the International Assn. of Machinists and

EX-AGENT'S WIFE, $3-MILLION BANK ACCOUNT SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bank account containing $3 million belonging to former narcotics agent 
Darnell Garcia of Rancho Palos Verdes, charged with drug trafficking and money 
laundering, has been seized by Luxembourg authorities, a prosecutor in that 
country disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Garcia's wife, Adaline Brigitte Garcia, has been arrested by 
Luxembourg police, according to informed sources. Details of her arrest were 
sketchy. Garcia was arrested in Luxembourg last July. 
</P>
<P>
Both the seizure of the bank account and the arrest of Garcia's wife occurred 
late last week, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A third arrest in Luxembourg of an American woman thought to be a Garcia 
associate also was believed to have occurred last week, according to a U.S. 
government source. But this could not be immediately confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Indicted Last Year 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 42, was indicted late last year in Los Angeles as a result of a federal 
Drug Enforcement Administration corruption investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A 42-count indictment alleged that Garcia and two other ex-DEA agents -- John 
Jackson, 40, of Claremont, and Wayne Countryman, 46, of Walnut -- all of whom 
worked in the agency's Los Angeles office, conspired to traffic in cocaine and 
heroin, and laundered their profits through banks in Switzerland and 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the three former DEA agents, the indictment named two other 
defendants, Jackson's wife, Barbara, 41; and Jackson's former business partner, 
Sherman Lair, 39, of Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, among the financial institutions with which Garcia 
did business was a Swiss Bank Corp. branch in Luxembourg, a tiny European 
nation with many banks. Luxembourg, like Switzerland, has strict bank secrecy 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, the indictment alleges, deposited $320,000 "into his personal account" 
at the Swiss bank branch in Luxembourg in May, 1988. No mention is made in the 
indictment of a $3-million Garcia deposit in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest last summer, at the request of federal prosecutors in Los 
Angeles, officials have been searching for cash Garcia allegedly deposited in 
foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 120 banks in Luxembourg and each one received a written 
government inquiry into whether Garcia had an account, a Luxembourg prosecutor, 
George Heisbourg, said Monday in disclosing the seizure of the account. 
</P>
<P>
Heisbourg would not identify the bank, declaring only that "we found it a week 
ago" in a foreign-based branch. Now, he said, it is up to U.S. officials to 
"bring us very clear proof that the money comes from drug trafficking" so that 
disposition of the account can be decided. 
</P>
<P>
A fugitive for seven months, Garcia was arrested by Luxembourg authorities in 
July after being hunted in several countries by DEA and other government 
officials. He is serving six months in a Luxembourg prison for traveling on a 
false Mexican passport. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American authorities are attempting to extradite Garcia so that he 
can stand trial in federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's wife, who is not a defendant in the indictment, has spent much of her 
time since her husband's arrest living in a Luxembourg hotel so that she could 
visit him in prison and consult with his local attorney. 
</P>
<P>
An informed source said it was not immediately clear whether her arrest was 
connected to the seizure of Garcia's bank account.

KUNG FU EXPERT IS A BLUR OF FISTS AND WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ron Scanlon demonstrates his fighting skills, he keeps up a continuous, 
easy patter, like a magician going through his paces. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, it doesn't matter if you're standing, sitting or lying down," he 
says, relaxed but alert in his wheelchair. "Fighting is the same. You can break 
his wrist. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Smith, tonight's "opponent," slashes at Scanlon's face. Scanlon leans back, 
grabbing Smith's arm and twisting it like a pipe wrench. Smith hits the mat 
like a wet rag. 
</P>
<P>
". . . You can break his arm. . . ." Smith charges again, and Scanlon smashes 
his arm against the wheelchair's armrest. 
</P>
<P>
". . . You can break his thumb. . . ." Another impetuous charge brings another 
twisting maneuver, leaving Smith in a heap on the mat. 
</P>
<P>
Paralyzed from the waist down since he was 9, Smith, now 32, is just getting 
warmed up. He has been laying waste to opponents since he was 17, when he first 
showed up at Bill Lasiter's little martial arts studio on Holt Boulevard in 
Ontario. The chop-and-grunt discipline is a demanding one, he says, with 
grueling physical conditioning and exacting sparring exercises. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years at it, he is a master kung fu practitioner, an eighth-degree 
black belt who teaches self defense to other people with disabilities at the 
Casa Colina Centers for Rehabilitation in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
At the 66-bed rehabilitation hospital, where Scanlon puts patients with brain 
injuries or spinal cord injuries through their paces, he's a rolling role 
model, a supremely confident paraplegic who has never acknowledged that he has 
a "disability." At Lasiter's storefront studio, where Scanlon has worked as an 
instructor, he's the resident phenom. As he maneuvers the wheelchair around the 
mats, the green belts and white belts keep a respectful distance. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, being in a wheelchair was an advantage," insists Scanlon, who was 
paralyzed after breaking his back in an automobile accident. "I think it gave 
me confidence as an individual." 
</P>
<P>
Is he good? "He's the first handicapped person I've ever seen who can teach 
upright people," says Lasiter, Scanlon's teacher for 15 years. "He doesn't have 
the use of his legs but he can teach people how to kick." 
</P>
<P>
A less independent person probably wouldn't have achieved half as much. From 
the start of his life as a paraplegic, Scanlon got a taste of some fusty old 
attitudes toward the disabled, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh out of the hospital, he was relegated to a school for the handicapped in 
his hometown of Upland. School administrators put him on an easygoing academic 
track, where he didn't even have to do his homework, he says. For physical 
education, they gave him meaningless archery practice, positioning him a few 
feet from the target. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't miss," says Scanlon, a brawny man from the waist up, with 
electric blue eyes and a thatch of dun-colored hair. "There was no skill 
building, nothing to build self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
It was a bitter pill for the youngster, who by then was ranging freely in his 
wheelchair, playing sandlot baseball and sometimes brawling with other 
teen-agers. He had developed an adolescent defensiveness about being in a 
chair. "It's the same as if people were always teasing you about wearing 
glasses," he says. "Sooner or later you're going to pop somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Lasiter remembers the day Scanlon first showed up at the martial arts studio. 
"He had wheeled over from Upland, about six or seven miles," he says. "He was 
sitting there watching. I said, 'Why don't you join?' He said, 'Me?' " 
</P>
<P>
"I got bit by it," says Scanlon. "I'd wheel down for the afternoon class, then 
stay on for evening class." 
</P>
<P>
Scanlon, who eventually was admitted to Upland High School and went on to 
Chaffey Junior College, still loves contact sports. He's a member of the Casa 
Colina Condors, national wheelchair basketball champions last year. And he 
plans to play later this month in the annual "Blister Bowl," a scrappy game of 
wheelchair football in a Santa Barbara parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Kung fu san soo, based on centuries-old fighting techniques from China, Japan 
and Okinawa, is a punishing means of self-defense, greeting attackers with 
kicks to the groin, knees to the spine and fingers to the eye. It's 
particularly adaptable to the wheelchair-bound, who can use parts of their 
chairs as weapons, "stomping" with the front wheels or "kneeing" with the 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no particular fighting stance," Scanlon says. "You fight from whatever 
position you're in. If somebody breaks into your house while you're in bed and 
grabs you around the throat, you can't say, 'Wait a minute, let me get into my 
stance.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's also a great way to widen a disabled person's horizons, Scanlon says. He 
tells of a young woman with muscular dystrophy who was wheeling down Hollywood 
Boulevard when a man attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up from behind and tried to pull her top off," he says. "She backed 
him into a wall, forced him around in front of her and started chasing him in 
her wheelchair. She came back to the class with a grin from ear to ear." 
</P>
<P>
When he works with the disabled, Scanlon is gentle and methodical. A young 
quadriplegic with limited movement in his arms, sits in the class, slumped 
motionless in his wheelchair. Scanlon coaxes him forward and soon has him 
blocking jabs from a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the street," he instructs the young man, "things happen and 
little red flags should go up. Not that you should be scared or paranoid. Just 
aware. 
</P>
<P>
"Out on the street," Scanlon says, "you can't afford to be a nice guy about 
it."

BUILDERS TO DONATE HELP ON HOMELESS SHELTER FOR 300 PEOPLE DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The building and development industry announced Monday that it plans to 
volunteer time and materials to design and build a 300-person homeless shelter 
near downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-million shelter -- constituting a singular partnership of private, 
church and public participation -- will be built across the street from the St. 
Vincent de Paul/Joan Kroc Center, which was opened in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter -- to be named after St. Vincent de Paul and the Building Industry 
Assn. of San Diego County, which is coordinating the donation -- will be 
operated as part of an unusual three-part complex that also includes the Kroc 
facility and a residence for homeless single men scheduled to open next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Expected to Begin in July 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 60,000-square-foot, three-story shelter is expected to 
begin in July, with completion wanted by Christmas. The building will house a 
300-person emergency shelter, a medical clinic, social-services offices and a 
county-run public school for homeless children who reside in the Kroc center. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Joe Carroll, a nationally recognized activist for the homeless who 
directs the St. Vincent de Paul operation, said he is "overjoyed" at the 
building industry's decision to volunteer its services. He estimated the price 
of the new facility at $2 million. He is seeking more donations for completion 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Builders and developers have long been among those approached by Father Carroll 
when seeking assistance for the homeless. Those contacts eventually resulted in 
the industry's decision to design and construct the new facility, which was 
originally expected to be built in 1992 -- a schedule that is now being moved 
up by two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a natural affiliation for us to take up and participate in what we 
know best," said Robert Morris, executive vice president of the Building 
Industry Assn. of San Diego. "Our hope is that this is one way that the 
industry can show that we are concerned about the quality of life in San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The City of San Diego is expected to kick in $200,000 for the project. The 
funds have already been budgeted and will be earmarked for the new shelter once 
approved by a city advisory board, said a spokeswoman for Councilman Bob 
Filner, who represents the district in which the facilities are being built. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 5,000 homeless people in the county on a 
given day; a significant number of them -- perhaps 2,000 -- are in downtown San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long accused the industry of contributing to the homeless problem 
by promoting high rents, home prices and the gentrification of poor 
neighborhoods. Morris, the housing industry spokesman, said builders have 
little control over the market that creates exorbitant housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the three-part project will represent "the most comprehensive 
complex for solving the plight of the homeless in any major city in the United 
States," said Carroll, who is known for his indefatigable fund-raising efforts 
on behalf of the homeless. He envisions a time when the center will contain all 
the facilities -- housing, health care, job training, counseling and the like 
-- to help the homeless become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praise From Homeless 
</P>
<P>
The new center will include emergency overnight space for 300 residents, who 
can eventually move into more complete housing elsewhere in the complex. The 
structure will also house the elementary school, now in the Kroc center, as 
well as expanded medical clinic, which will include dental services. Office 
space in the building is to be leased to social-service agencies; the rent is 
to be allocated toward shelter operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The $11.7-million Joan Kroc Center, which has received praise from homeless 
advocates nationwide, was opened in August, 1987. It houses 350 men, women and 
children, and provides services to 750 more daily, Carroll said. Among the 
services available are meals, showers, medical aid, free clothing, job 
counseling and literacy classes. 
</P>
<P>
The $2-million single men's shelter, which is scheduled to be dedicated Nov. 
13, is to have beds for 150 residents. Single men constitute the largest single 
percentage of the homeless.

SOCCER GAMES ON SCHOOL SITE GET OFFICIAL KICKING AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kids playing soccer on the school grounds on a sunny fall afternoon. What's 
wrong with that? Well, in one North County community, it's illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible," said Solana Beach schools Supt. Ray Edman. "But true." 
</P>
<P>
The schoolyard in question is the future Fairbanks Ranch elementary school to 
be built in 1991, or '92 at the latest, depending upon Edman's success at 
solving the bureaucratic maze that the state imposes on school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The schoolyard is home to more than 200 soccer-crazy youngsters. Add to that 
gang their parents, their coaches and their fans, and there's usually quite a 
crowd on the 9-acre site of the future school, at the corner of El Apajo and 
San Dieguito Road. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguars and station wagons line the curb. Sounds of the competition echo from 
behind the shrubs that line the vacant lot. Good clean fun. But illegal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Permit Needed 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County lawyers told the Solana Beach school district in December that 
county zoning laws require the district to obtain a permit before any nonschool 
usage of the Fairbanks field can be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the permit, which probably would be granted, is a bit steep for the 
small elementary school district. Edman estimates that it would cost from 
$3,000 to $12,000, plus six months' of effort, to obtain the required county 
document. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, once the school is built, the grounds will be open to the soccer 
players and any other group that meets the district's criteria because school 
property is exempt from county zoning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
But that's tomorrow, and this is today. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Susan Golding came to the rescue by suggesting a 
middle road -- an amendment to the county's zoning ordinance that would allow 
compatible activities on undeveloped school sites under the same rules that 
apply for schoolyard activities. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the matter recently came before supervisors, San Dieguito Planning 
Group officials mounted a campaign against the proposal and convinced board 
members to send the matter back to the county Planning Commission for another 
look. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been painted as the bad guys," Al Frowiss, planning group chairman, 
said. "But this is a countywide issue," he explained, "and it is not at all 
correct to bastardize the county zoning ordinance" just to allow a bunch of 
children to play ball on a Fairbanks Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
County planners concede that a change that would allow soccer on the Fairbanks 
field would also allow relatively unregulated activities on any other school 
site in unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fee Waiver Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Frowiss suggested that, instead of changing the zoning ordinance, the county 
waive the permit fee for the Solana Beach school district and grant the permit, 
with conditions to assure neighboring residents that the vacant lot won't 
become a neighborhood nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Edman said the school district has rules for use of school properties, and the 
rules will be followed if the county allows the district to supervise the 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Hours of operation, types of activities, adult supervision and other 
requirements will be met, Edman said, if the county will permit the school 
district to take charge of its Fairbanks property. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Edman said, "we could charge fees for the use of the site, which would 
give us funds to keep the property free of litter and in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Paul Marks, a member of the San Dieguito Planning Group, questions 
whether the rules Edman plans to enforce are adequate because they contain no 
requirements for fencing or restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Marks informed the County Planning Department that "the existing soccer field 
on El Apajo in the Fairbanks Ranch area has been the subject of problems for 
neighbors because the children using the soccer fields have used their back 
yards as latrines." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Community Asset 
</P>
<P>
Edman insists that the future school site is a community asset that should be 
used, legally, by area youngsters for such healthy, wholesome sports as soccer. 
Even rich kids need a place to play, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Solana Beach school district is mounting a campaign to overwhelm the 
opposition: letters to county planning commissioners and county supervisors and 
a petition drive to obtain at least 1,000 signatures in favor of using the site 
as a soccer field. A sizable band of supporters is expected to attend the 
county planning commission when the issue is discussed Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
But, while the planning group and school district spar over use of the vacant 
land, the soccer play continues in full swing, as it has for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We must do something about this situation," Edman said. "We can't continue to 
turn our backs against the use of the property. We need the authority to step 
in and control activities there. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, we are going to have to act to shut the soccer field down." 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEST PILOT'S WIDOW WINS $1.4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The widow of Rockwell International test pilot Tommie Douglas Benefield, who 
was killed in the crash of a B-1 bomber prototype five years ago, has been 
awarded a $1.4-million judgement against an engineering company that made 
equipment for the plane. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury determined that part of a mechanism that was 
designed to put a parachute into place above the plane's ejection capsule was 
defective. 
</P>
<P>
That defect caused the capsule to slam into the desert floor at an angle, 
killing Benefield, said attorney Tom Girardi, who represented Suzanne Benefield 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed in 1984 while on a low-speed, low-altitude test run over the 
Mohave Desert, less than a week before Rockwell rolled out the first production 
model of the $200-million bomber. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crash, Air Force officials said the crew failed to shift 
fuel inside the bomber as they moved the wings forward, causing the craft to 
lose its balance. Two others aboard the plane survived. 
</P>
<P>
Denver-based Ordinance Engineering Associates, which manufactured the equipment 
in question, is considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that his death was the fault of OEA," said Philip Johnson, 
attorney for the firm.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN'S BODY FOUND IN CHARRED APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 33-year-old Boyle Heights man who had threatened to kill his mother and "take 
out" his neighbors set fire to the bedroom in his apartment, and then shot 
himself in the head early Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Manning's badly burned body was found at dawn in the charred bedroom, 
which was crammed with old rock 'n' roll records and tapes, paramilitary garb 
and weapons manuals. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a bullet wound in his head and a gun was found near the body," said 
Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigator John Little. 
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors reported being awakened by a powerful blast that rattled 
windows in the area about 2:45 a.m., Little said "there was no indication of a 
bomb or an incendiary device." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Little speculated that the explosion could have been caused by a back 
draft of air that ignited when flames engulfed objects in the room, such as 
furniture and books. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's mother, Brigitta Manning, 65, blamed the apparent suicide on problems 
her son was having finding work. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't get a job," she said. "Nobody wanted him." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, however, described the tall, lanky man as a short-tempered, 
emotionally unstable recluse who occasionally emerged from his room -- dressed 
in combat fatigues, black boots and a beret -- to swear at them or deliver

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN, FAMILY IN HIDING AFTER FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Paramount man was in hiding with his family Monday, one day after he shot and 
killed an alleged gang member who threatened to kill members of the man's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Vasquez, 24, of Lynwood, was shot by the man, who lives on San Marcus 
Street, about 7 p.m. Sunday. Vasquez died a short time later at Charter 
Suburban Hospital, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Al Grant. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about an hour after gang members allegedly took a bicycle 
belonging to the man's son. When the boy recovered the bicycle, Vasquez and a 
companion went to the home, confronted the boy's father and threatened to kill 
members of his family, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez reached for a pistol in his waistband and the father shot him with a 
.38-caliber pistol. Grant said the shooting appeared to have been in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The father, whose name was not released, was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
He left the home with his family late Sunday or early Monday, fearing gang 
retaliation, Grant said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OREGON TO GARNISHEE ECCLESIA PARENTS' PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Children's Services Division of the state of Oregon says it plans to begin 
garnishment of wages of Ecclesia Athletic Assn. parents whose children remain 
in state custody almost a year after the beating death of the group founder's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Wilson, manager of the agency's Clackamas County office, said the state 
had spent more than $545,000 through July 1 to care for the 53 children taken 
into protective custody after Dayna Broussard, 8, daughter of Eldridge 
Broussard Jr., was slain at a group home near Sandy, east of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard founded Ecclesia at the Watts Christian Center in Los Angeles to 
provide what he called religious and athletic training for inner-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
Forty of the 53 children have been placed in foster homes, but all remain in 
state custody. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the state has obtained judgments against 15 Ecclesia parents for 
more than $31,000 in child support. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard has visited his two surviving children twice since they were taken 
into custody after the Oct. 13 death of their sister. 
</P>
<P>
Four adult Ecclesia members later were convicted of first-degree manslaughter 
and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Broussard was not charged in that case, 
but is under federal investigation for possibly violating the civil rights of 
the 53 children. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Dayna Broussard died after she was beaten with plastic pipes, 
rubber hoses and other devices for taking a piece of squash from another 
child's plate.

ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE TO BUILD A NEW ENTRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster have much to be proud of 
these days. The region's only community college celebrated its 60th anniversary 
this fall, enrollment is up to about 8,600 students, and even that figure is 
expected to nearly double by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one prominent part of the campus that no one boasts about. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the main entrance of the campus has been a virtually barren dirt 
lot, a five-acre parcel that has embarrassed college officials and has been 
regarded as an eyesore by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
That is about to change, however. The college's Board of Trustees on Monday 
night voted 5 to 0 to spend $147,000 on an elaborate make-over of part of the 
corner, including two concrete slabs bearing the school's name, a concrete 
plaza and a tree-lined walkway. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of citizens of the Antelope Valley will never set foot on our 
campus. But the picture those people form of the college is what they get when 
they drive by," said college President Allan Kurki, who called the expenditure 
"an outstanding idea." 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last year, this has been the No. 1 topic people in the community have 
asked me about," Board President James Du Pratt Jr. said. "And it's always been 
by the throat." 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said the project symbolizes the future of the college, which he expects 
to grow to 16,000 students and receive as much as $35 million in improvements 
in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
The board vote came after a brief debate, during which board member Donald Ross 
warned that the incised lettering on the concrete blocks would not be readily 
visible. "Uncolored concrete on uncolored concrete is kind of blah on blah," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to improve the main entrance to the 125-acre campus, at the northwest 
corner of 30th Street West and Avenue K, have been under discussion for at 
least the past four years. The final design was selected after half a dozen or 
so others were rejected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for the future, you know. We're looking at a sign that will last 50 
years. It's not just a little sign that's going to come down," said college 
Vice President William Fellers. He added that the job could start within two 
weeks and could be completed before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, about the only thing that distinguished the entrance corner of 
the campus was a small and aged sign on poles that bore the college's name and 
space for notices of campus events. Kurki called it "rinky-dink" and Fellers 
likened it to a sign befitting a junior high school, not a college. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign Removed 
</P>
<P>
That sign was removed in recent weeks to make way for the college's new "Main 
Entrance Monument Plaza." It will include the two concrete slabs set into the 
ground, each about 30 feet wide and 4 feet tall, bearing the college's name in 
foot-high letters. One will face 30th Street West and the other Avenue K. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Fellers said, will be a concrete plaza, which students can use 
while waiting for buses, with half a dozen waist-high concrete light stands at 
the street corner. Behind the plaza, a 350-foot-long sidewalk lined with 24 
trees will lead back to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
To date, no one has complained about the cost of the project, even though the 
$147,000-contract awarded to Samrod Corp. of Lancaster, based on its low bid, 
exceeded the college's original $130,000 estimate. "We feel confident this is a 
good bid for the money," Fellers said.

SIMI SCHOOLS SETTLE SUIT ALLEGING SEX HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley Unified School District has negotiated a tentative settlement 
of a lawsuit that accused a high school principal of sexually harassing a staff 
psychologist for two years until she accepted a demotion to escape him, lawyers 
involved in the case said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the lawsuit refused to disclose the financial terms of the 
agreement, but the psychologist who brought the lawsuit, Sara Kopman-Davis, 
described the amount as "real substantial, especially for a school district." 
</P>
<P>
"Settlement-wise, I'm satisfied, but money isn't what I wanted," said 
Kopman-Davis, who filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "I wanted 
him reprimanded. As far as I know, he has never been reprimanded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations Denied 
</P>
<P>
The chief defendant, Apollo High School Principal Brad Greene, declined to 
comment. His attorney, J. Jane Fox of Ventura, said he denied all the 
allegations and that the pending settlement should not be considered an 
admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Greene was accused in the lawsuit of making sexually explicit remarks to 
Kopman-Davis as part of an effort to seduce her, of touching and grabbing her, 
and of giving her a poor evaluation in the spring of 1987 after she repeatedly 
rejected him -- including rebuffing his advances at a professional conference 
in San Francisco, said her lawyer, Julia Dragojevic. 
</P>
<P>
Fox and the school district's attorney, Donald F. Austin of Oxnard, said the 
settlement agreement still had to be signed by Greene, as well as school 
district officials, to become final, and that those signatures were expected 
"within the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
Austin acknowledged that under the terms of the agreement, three school 
district officials were to be dismissed as defendants -- Supt. John Duncan and 
two assistant superintendents, Allan Jacobs, who is in charge of curriculum, 
and Robert Marcus, who was in charge of personnel and has since retired. 
</P>
<P>
Kopman-Davis and Dragojevic claimed that she took her complaints about Greene 
to the three officials and received no action except for an offer to transfer 
to another school. She said Monday that she finally accepted a transfer in the 
fall of 1987 from Apollo High School, the district's alternative high school 
for problem students, to Royal High School, the district's main high school. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the transfer, Kopman-Davis said she took a demotion from school 
psychologist to guidance counselor, accompanied by a $4,000 cut in salary. 
</P>
<P>
She filed suit in August, 1988, after filing a complaint with the state Fair 
Employment and Housing Board and being told it could take years to resolve, 
according to Dragojevic. The suit named as defendants Greene, the school 
district, the three district officials and the school board, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Administration 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the district administration had investigated Kopman-Davis's claims 
in good faith "but had very little to go on" because she did not provide any 
corroborating evidence. He said she was given the chance to provide names of 
witnesses or other sources during each meeting with the officials and did not, 
leaving the district little choice but to offer her a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know who to believe," said Austin, who described both Greene and 
Kopman-Davis as respected employees. Greene, 48, has been employed by the 
district since 1967, and Kopman-Davis, 32, since 1981, Dragojevic said. 
</P>
<P>
School Board President Lewis Roth said that Greene had never been reprimanded 
for sexual misconduct, and that the board had no plans to discipline him or 
Kopman-Davis. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the litigation, three women gave sworn statements on 
Kopman-Davis's behalf that they also had been sexually harassed by Greene while 
employed as teachers at the school, according to Kopman-Davis and her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the witnesses testified in a deposition that she had had a five-year 
sexual relationship with Greene and that after she ended it, the principal 
threatened to end her teaching career, according to Dragojevic. That woman and 
a second witness have since left teaching, according to Dragojevic, who said 
the third witness still works for Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Fox declined to discuss the allegations against her client. According to 
Austin, the district's attorney, Greene claimed that the allegations were made 
in response to an evaluation he wrote of Kopman-Davis, faulting her work. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said Monday that he is still employed by the district as principal of 
Apollo High School, which serves about 300 students. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Duncan did not return a reporter's phone calls Monday. Board member Diane 
Collins refused to comment.

L.A., PALMDALE SCRAMBLING FOR TRAIN; 
</P>
<P>
2 CITIES CRITICIZE REPORT THAT FAVORS ORANGE COUNTY FOR RAIL LINE TO LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles and Palmdale officials Monday challenged a consultant's finding 
that Anaheim was a better bet than the northern San Fernando Valley for the 
terminus of a proposed "gambler's special" high-speed train linking Las Vegas 
and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they factored in how much traffic would be generated if we got 
that airport going up there in Palmdale," said Los Angeles City Council 
President John Ferraro, referring to the city's long-closed Palmdale Air 
Terminal. Los Angeles wants Palmdale to be an intermediate stop on the rail 
route between Las Vegas and the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We desperately need that airport opened," Ferraro said, "and we'll keep 
pushing for it." 
</P>
<P>
And a top Palmdale official said his Antelope Valley city would soon release 
its own report indicating that routing the train through Palmdale would be less 
costly than through heavily congested San Bernardino and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale report will project continued rapid population growth in both the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys and suggests that future commuter ridership 
between Palmdale and the San Fernando Valley "can be expected to greatly 
increase," said Palmdale Mayor William Knight. 
</P>
<P>
The futuristic $4-billion rail project is the brainchild of Las Vegas gambling 
interests, which view it as a vehicle for boosting the number of gamblers at 
Nevada hotels and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Needed 
</P>
<P>
Technologies under consideration are a still-experimental West German magnetic 
levitation system, the French TGV high-speed train and the Japanese bullet 
train. 
</P>
<P>
The train would be built with private funds, but would require approval of the 
California Legislature because most of its 230 miles of track would be in the 
Interstate 15 right of way. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant's report released Friday was prepared by the California-Nevada 
Super-Speed Ground Transportation Commission, which was created by the two 
states' legislatures to select a route. 
</P>
<P>
Ridership for an Anaheim-to-Las Vegas line was projected to be as high as 5.7 
million round trips annually by the year 2000, and would be 6.5 million if the 
train also stops in Ontario, the consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a line between Las Vegas and the northern San Fernando Valley 
would draw a maximum of 2.3 million round-trip riders a year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The rival routes were much closer in the number of commuters they would draw. 
</P>
<P>
A separate commuter service using the same tracks between Orange and San 
Bernardino counties would draw 433,000 round-trip passengers annually, while a 
similar commuter service between the northern Valley and Palmdale would draw 
418,000 riders, the report predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles plan, strongly supported by Mayor Tom Bradley, envisions the 
high-speed train originating in Mission Hills or Sylmar as a vehicle for 
relieving congestion at Los Angeles International Airport by encouraging 
passengers to use the Palmdale Air Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The air terminal, which has been unused since 1985 for lack of an airline 
willing to offer service, is scheduled to go back into operation in January 
when America West Airlines commences four daily flights to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County leaders say the train would provide transportation for the small 
army of workers who commute daily to Orange County jobs from their homes in San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties, where housing is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourism Boost 
</P>
<P>
In addition, said Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth, an Anaheim terminus 
would boost tourism by encouraging vacationers to combine visits to Orange 
County, which attracts 34 millions tourists annually, with a trip to Las Vegas, 
which has 17 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, a former mayor of Anaheim and chief booster of the Orange County 
proposal, said "it's tourism that will make the Anaheim proposal work, because 
it will provide the ridership. The commuter relief will be an extra benefit, 
although it's an important one." 
</P>
<P>
Roth, a member of the bistate commission, said he is investigating whether an 
Anaheim-Las Vegas train might also ferry passengers to George Air Force Base in 
Victorville, which is slated to be closed within three years and might be 
converted to a civilian airport. 
</P>
<P>
The base, located a few miles west of Interstate 15 and about 30 miles south of 
Barstow, "could be used to relieve John Wayne Airport and increase patronage on 
the train," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's Knight, acknowledging that Anaheim has the ridership edge, said 
proponents of the Palmdale route might have to take their case to the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Which is the greater need for Southern California?" he asked. "I think it's 
commuter relief and relief at Los Angeles County airports." 
</P>
<P>
The bistate commission is scheduled to use its consultant's report as a basis 
for selecting a route, possibly as early as its Oct. 27 meeting in Los Angeles.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S CAPABLE OF SAYING ALMOST ANYTHING ONCE HE GETS COOKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

College football commentator Beano Cook, quoted by Sandra McKee of the 
Baltimore Evening Sun on Air Force quarterback Dee Dowis' chances to win the 
Heisman Trophy: 
</P>
<P>
"If Dowis can get 100 yards on Notre Dame Saturday, it will be a big boost for 
him. To this point, he's gotten a lot of yards against some lesser opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Against Notre Dame, he'll be playing behind a line that couldn't play for 
Notre Dame. Heck, there are probably only five guys on the whole Air Force team 
that could get a tryout with Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
Who will win the Heisman? "You just can't tell," Cook said. "I still think the 
majority of people who vote for this award are like the people in Congress -- 
not very bright. So who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Who's on first?: From Tim Kurkjian of the Baltimore Sun: 
</P>
<P>
"Texas Ranger first baseman Rafael Palmeiro was asked to fill out a ballot for 
best defensive players in the league. When he got to the word assist, he asked, 
'How you do get an assist?' Palmeiro once asked, 'How many teams are there in 
the American League?' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Kurkjian: "The Toronto Blue Jays' Mike Flanagan has a new nickname for 
(Detroit) Tiger reliever Mike Schwabe: Chemo. Get it? Chemo Schwabe." 
</P>
<P>
All in good taste: Vida Blue, former pitcher for the Oakland Athletics and San 
Francisco Giants, got married during the last weekend of the regular season on 
the field at Candlestick Park. The ceremony included an honor guard of Giants 
with raised bats and a carriage ride for the newlyweds around the outfield. 
When a TV crew approached the groom and asked for an interview, Blue declined 
because he "didn't want to turn his wedding into a circus." 
</P>
<P>
Not ready for any time: Speaking of bad taste, how lame was the "Saturday Night 
Live" sketch on the late Bart Giamatti? It began with an ersatz Commissioner 
Fay Vincent, who was a friend of Giamatti, telling baseball's owners that he 
would like all players to wear armbands bearing Giamatti's initials during the 
1990 season. It went straight downhill from there, with the Vincent character 
demanding that baseball terms, stadiums, and, finally, players and owners be 
renamed for Giamatti. The audience didn't think it was funny, either. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Oct. 10, 1981, USC's Marcus Allen rushed for 211 yards, his 
fifth straight 200-plus game, against Arizona. Who won the game? 
</P>
<P>
Thrill is gone: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I don't want to say a Vin Scully broadcast is stereotyped, but I can't 
tell if the NBC headliner is live or Memorex anymore." 
</P>
<P>

The New York Islanders scored four times within five minutes in the third 
period and rallied to beat the Canucks, 5-2, in a National Hockey League game 
Monday at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by David Volek, Doug Crossman, Brent Sutter and Alan Kerr wiped out a 2-1 
Vancouver lead. 
</P>
<P>
Volek, who assisted on two other goals, tied the score when he batted in a 
rebound at 14:06, Crossman and Sutter scored on power plays and Kerr added an 
empty-net goal to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
New York, which had 30 shots on goal, had 19 of those in the third period. 
Vancouver goalie Steve Weeks kept the Canucks in the game until the last five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks had 37 shots on Glen Healy, who made several difficult saves during 
the scoreless opening period, most of them during two Vancouver power plays. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Flatley scored the Islanders' first goal at 5:28 of the second period, 
converting a pass from Volek. The play was started by a sharp pass from 
defenseman Jeff Norton in the neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
Petri Skriko and Paul Reinhart scored Vancouver's goals. Reinhart's goal gave 
the Canucks a 2-1 lead at 5:59 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 2, Montreal 0 -- Cam Neeley and Randy Burridge scored in the first 
period and goalie Reggie Lemelin earned his 10th NHL shutout as the Bruins won 
at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bruins' first regular-season victory over the Canadiens since Feb. 
4, 1988. The Bruins were 0-7-1 against Montreal last season.

ELIGIBLE TO RETURN SUNDAY, TOLLIVER PRACTICING WITH CHARGERS AGAIN

Charger Coach Dan Henning is worried about rookie quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver. Tolliver, who broke his left collarbone against Phoenix in the final 
exhibition game Sept. 1, is worried about Henning. 
</P>
<P>
Henning knows Tolliver is eligible to come off injured reserve after the 
Chargers' home game Sunday against Seattle. But he's concerned about what might 
happen if he brings Tolliver back before the bone completely heals. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy's not a big milk drinker," Henning said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver is concerned Henning may be too protective about his health. 
</P>
<P>
"My time's up, I'm outta jail," Tolliver said after reading defenses and 
throwing to route-running receivers during a light workout Monday. It was the 
first time Tolliver had done so since the injury. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver said team physician Gary Losse inspected the shoulder Monday and told 
him the injury was "playable." Tolliver also said he expected to start 
practicing in pads this week. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I'm not a doctor. I went to school five years and am still 
classified as a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
The latter remark was a concession to conventional medical wisdom and Henning's 
final authority in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait as long as we can," Henning said, when asked how soon Tolliver 
would begin practicing on a regular basis. Asked if it was a certainty that 
Tolliver would be activated after the Seattle game, Henning said: "It's not a 
slam dunk. But it's above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Chargers, Tolliver's return isn't urgent. At least not yet. 
Injury-prone quarterback Jim McMahon is relatively healthy. McMahon's back-up 
at the moment, David Archer, is perfectly fit. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Vlasic, who seriously injured his knee against the Rams last 
year, is eligible to come off the physically-unable-to-perform list next week. 
</P>
<P>
But Henning made it clear before Tolliver's injury that Tolliver is the 
Chargers' No. 2 quarterback. And he has said nothing since to disabuse anybody 
of that notion. 
</P>
<P>
The knee injury sustained by H-back Rod Bernstine in Sunday's 16-10 loss at 
Denver isn't severe. But, Henning said, it will probably keep Bernstine out of 
action against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine was in Bryan, Tex., Monday attending his stepfather's funeral. 
Henning said Bernstine could return for treatment as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine is the Chargers' leading receiver with 21 receptions and he is their 
third leading rusher with 137 yards in 15 carries (9.1 average). His injury is 
strained medial collateral ligaments of the left knee. 
</P>
<P>
That's the same knee Bernstine hurt last December at Cincinnati. He missed the 
final two games of 1988. But Sunday's damage was in a different area of the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Henning reported no other significant injuries from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Two starters, wide receiver Quinn Early and cornerback Sam Seale, didn't play 
against the Broncos because of injuries. Henning said he thought Early (knee) 
would be back this week but he wasn't sure about Seale (shoulder). 
</P>
<P>
Maybe somebody should remind Denver the Broncos are 4-1. It was hard to tell by 
reading the sports pages one day after they beat the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a ways to go to be where we want to be," said Denver Coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get that urgency," said Denver tight end Clarence Kay. "But you 
can't point fingers right now." 
</P>
<P>
"How about a little punch from what is supposed to be one of the most exciting 
offenses in the National Football League," asked columnist Teri Thompson in 
Monday's edition of the Rocky Mountain News. "How about some points? How about 
some big plays?" 
</P>
<P>
How about staying in touch with reality? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the two games in which they have taken the ball away more times than they 
have turned it over, the Chargers have won. In the three games in which they 
haven't, the Chargers have lost. . . . Charger Coach Dan Henning praised the 
75,222 people who showed up at Mile High Stadium Sunday to watch Denver beat 
his team, 16-10. "I thought they were excellent," he said. "That's a large 
stadium and it was a full house, but that was basically a good crowd." Henning 
said he had heard Denver's crowd might be unruly because of the boorish 
behavior of Cleveland's fans in Denver's 16-13 road loss in Week Four. . . . 
Henning credited the blocking of running backs Marion Butts and Tim Spencer and 
the play of left tackle Joel Patten in preventing Simon Fletcher, the Broncos' 
right outside linebacker, from sacking quarterback Jim McMahon Sunday. Fletcher 
entered the game leading the NFL with 6 1/2 sacks.

FORBES RANKS KLUGE AS RICHEST AMERICAN;

WALTON ENDS 4-YEAR REIGN BY DIVIDING FORTUNE AMONG CHILDREN

<P>
Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is worth an estimated $5.2 billion, 
but he had to back into first place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 
richest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart stores discount chain, who 
divvied his $9-billion fortune among himself and his four children and ended a 
four-year reign as Forbes' wealthiest person. 
</P>
<P>
Among other notables on the list, developer Donald J. Trump compounded his 
already considerable fortune and financiers Michael Milken and Carl C. Icahn 
joined the billionaires club. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about $269 billion, up 
nearly $50 billion from the previous year, a 22% increase that substantially 
outpaced last year's 4.4% inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prototypical Member 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the total wealth of the richest would come just short of bailing 
out the nation's failed savings and loans over the next 30 years, the cost of 
which was estimated by Congress at $285 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The list, released Monday, appears in the Oct. 23 edition of Forbes and is 
based on estimated holdings as of Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The prototypical member of Forbes' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old male with 3.1 
children who has been married 1.4 times and had a net worth of $672 million 
last year, more than the gross national product of Lesotho, Forbes stated. 
</P>
<P>
For the richest, the last year has been a very good one. Many of the wealthy 
rebounded nicely from the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum net worth to 
make the list rose to $275 million from $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the pinnacle was Kluge, 75, of Charlottesville, Va., whose holdings rose an 
estimated $2 billion from last year thanks to a tripling in the value of his 
holdings in cellular telephones, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that "klug" in German 
means smart. 
</P>
<P>
For Walton, charity began at home. The 71-year-old from Bentonville, Ark., who 
milked cows during the Depression to support his family, split his Wal-Mart and 
other assets equally with his four children. While the family's total holdings 
increased to $9 billion from $6.7 billion, the individual family members tied 
for 20th on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Moving up to second from 12th place was investor Warren Buffett, 59, of Omaha, 
Neb., the head of Berkshire Hathaway whose stock market-based fortune nearly 
doubled to $4.2 billion. Behind him was Sumner Murray Redstone, head of 
National Amusements Inc. and entertainment giant Viacom, with $2.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Billionaires 
</P>
<P>
America has more billionaires than any other nation -- Japan is second with 41 
-- but the richest of the rich live abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private individual in the world, 
according to Forbes. He is topped by six Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian 
publisher Kenneth Roy Thompson. Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money 
in land, railroads and resorts, is worth about $15 billion, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen new billionaires joined the Forbes American list, including Laurence 
and Robert Tisch of Loews Corp. at $1.36 billion apiece, entertainment mogul 
Kirk Kerkorian at $1.29 billion, indicted junk bond financier Milken at $1.27 
billion and TWA boss Icahn at $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Trump also was among the individual standouts, adding $700 million to his 
empire of hotels, casinos and an airline for a $1.7-billion total. 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight year, the youngest self-made billionaire was 
33-year-old William Henry Gates III at $1.25 billion. Gates dropped out of 
Harvard University to found Microsoft in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis beer and baseball magnate August Anheuser Busch Jr., who died on 
Sept. 29 at age 90, was included on the list with $1.5 billion. Forbes said it 
compiled its profiles before the death. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest on the list is 32-year-old Caroline Marie Getty, daughter of the 
late George Getty, with her $330-million inheritance. The oldest of the wealthy 
remained 94-year-old Mansfield Freeman of Greensboro, Vt., who holds a stake in 
the insurer American International Group, with $360 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among the losers were real estate investor and builder Fred Trammell Crow, 
whose net worth, Forbes estimated, sank to $300 million from $775 million, 
thanks to softness in commercial real estate. Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione 
slipped into something less comfortable and dropped off the list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Address 
</P>
<P>
The list contains 346 men and 54 women; 159 inherited their wealth; no one from 
Maine, North Dakota or Alaska qualified; Yale had 22 of the richest, Harvard 17 
and the University of Pennsylvania 12; the 45 with master's degrees in business 
had an average net worth of $895 million, while the 10 high-school dropouts had 
an average of $854 million. 
</P>
<P>
About 20%, or 82, of those listed live in or near New York City, with Los 
Angeles second in plutocratic residences with 32 and San Francisco third at 19. 
Twenty-one people on the list own at least one-third of a major league sports 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Publisher Malcolm Forbes included his own biographical data and reported 
estimates of his net worth but refused, as usual, to divulge his wealth. 
Forbes' sketch was included in the under-$500 million category. "I'm solvent," 
he said.

PRIVATE SCHOOL EARNS TINY LOCAL COMPANY NATIONAL ATTENTION

Benjamin Hatcher's role at G. T. Water Products Inc. in Moorpark lets him get 
out of company headquarters to see the world quite a bit. The same goes for 
Jennifer Tash and Shannon Gabrilson. 
</P>
<P>
Some days, they're off to the zoo. Other days, it's whale watching or a visit 
to the Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
But when they're at G. T., which makes plumbing equipment, it's always work, 
work, work: not marketing or inventory control but lots of math, social studies 
and science. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound like pretty light fare for executives, but Hatcher, Tash, and 
Gabrilson aren't executives. They're kids -- three of the 12 students in a 
school run exclusively for the children of G. T. employees. 
</P>
<P>
G. T.'s owner, George Tash, wasn't looking to get his company national 
attention two years ago when he decided to open a private school for his 
employees. He was just looking for alternative education for his two children. 
</P>
<P>
But the innovation earned the small company, which makes cleaning devices for 
clogged drains, toilet plungers and water-powered pumps, a spot on Working 
Mother magazine's list of the 60 best companies in the U.S. to work for. The 
New York-based magazine's list in its October issue also included some bigger 
enterprises, such as IBM and AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
G. T.'s school, which is free to employees, costs Tash about $30,000 a year to 
run. It makes for a modest investment for G. T., which has 29 employees and 
does about $3 million a year in sales. Employee turnover is always a worry for 
a small company. But Candice Jameson Bilaver, G. T.'s vice president for 
marketing, says turnover isn't a problem and they want to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"The peace of mind to the mothers who have worked here has been incredible," 
said Bilaver. "They can concentrate on their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The school, which is set up in a room within G. T's offices, is a throwback to 
the days of the one-room schoolhouse. Tash hired Brian Kearsey, who had taught 
at a Montessori school in Thousand Oaks, to run his school for children aged 4 
to 16. The school is run according to the philosophy of Maria Montessori, who 
believed that children should be largely left alone to teach themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The school only has to prove that it has a curriculum and takes attendance to 
be approved by the state. But Kearsey said the students also take yearly 
state-designed tests to show they are progressing apace. 
</P>
<P>
Janette Rose, G. T.'s customer service manager, has two of her three children 
-- Athena, 11, and Arielle, 8 -- attending the school. "I can go home at night 
and I don't feel like I've been away from my kids all day long," said Rose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flexible Hours 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, five of the seven working mothers in G. T.'s office suite have put 
their kids in the school, according to Bilaver. The children of the others, she 
said, are too young or too old. Bilaver said only one working mother in G. T.'s 
factory has enrolled her child. 
</P>
<P>
G. T.'s willingness to deal with working mothers' problems is no accident. 
Women fill three of the four top sales slots at the company. And the 10-person 
office staff has seven working mothers, Bilaver said. Tash also offers flexible 
work hours and maternity leaves for his employees. 
</P>
<P>
The number of women on its staff makes G. T. a small, extreme case of the 
feminization of the workplace that's been progressing nationally over the past 
25 years. In 1980, about 43% of the work force were women -- compared to only 
33% in 1960, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And of the 14.6 
million women who joined the work force between 1960 and 1984, about 8 million 
came from families with children, according to a 1987 study by the Hudson 
Institute in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in two-income couples is due, the Hudson report says, to the fact 
that "slow economic growth has made two earners a necessity for many families 
striving for a middle-class life style." 
</P>
<P>
Milton Moskowitz and Carol Townsend, who wrote "The 60 Best Companies for 
Working Mothers" magazine article, found only one other company besides G. T. 
in the country that has started an on-premise school: In 1987, American Bankers 
Insurance Group in Miami paid construction costs to have the Dade County school 
system start up an elementary school for about 78 kindergartners and first- and 
second-grade students of employees. 
</P>
<P>
G. T. pays its 19 factory workers standard industry wages of $6 to $7.50 an 
hour. Bilaver said that workers who stay with the company can make more. She 
pointed out that the company extends a profit-sharing pension plan -- worth 
about 15% to 20% of a worker's annual salary -- to all its employees. Moreover, 
the school itself is worth money to the parents who use it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help for Working Dads 
</P>
<P>
G. T. gives its factory workers the option of working only four days a week 
with full benefits. The company's bookkeeper, a working mother, works only 
Tuesday through Friday, too. Bilaver said the company also takes pride in 
giving mothers the time off they need for their children's dental appointments 
and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Tash, 48, says the accommodations the company has made for working mothers 
apply equally to working fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Class at G. T.'s school may not much resemble most people's memory of grade 
school. On a recent morning, the 12 students attending classes were squirming 
and whispering as they pleased, while they took themselves through self-guided 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
One young girl sat at a personal computer playing "Math Rabbit," while a group 
of children read together about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster, and yet 
another girl -- George Tash's 12-year-old daughter, Jennifer -- got help in 
algebra from teacher Kearsey. 
</P>
<P>
Tash himself never took much to structured learning, and his kids' own 
experience in school years later left him fed up. "The teachers, they would say 
they were having problems with the kids, so I went to the school to see what 
the problem was," said Tash. "The teachers were dead. They lacked life. They 
just had a job."

HONDA FOUNDER IS FIRST JAPANESE IN AUTO HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who helped devastate Detroit has come to be honored and enshrined by it 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
At a dinner in downtown Detroit, Soichiro Honda, the original Mr. Honda of the 
Honda Motor Co., will become the first Japanese auto executive to be inducted 
into America's Automotive Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
He will thus be immortalized alongside the legends of the U.S. auto industry, 
whose names still ring down through the ages: Henry Ford. Walter P. Chrysler. 
Ransom Olds. Alfred P. Sloan. And now, Soichiro Honda, the last living founder 
of any of the world's major auto companies. 
</P>
<P>
He will be only the first of what Hall of Fame officials say will be many 
Japanese industry pioneers to be inducted. 
</P>
<P>
Honda's election to the hall is, of course, fraught with painful irony. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Honda's company and his cars have brought nothing but headaches to 
Detroit. For nearly two decades, Honda Motor has been in the vanguard of the 
Japanese invasion of the American car market, taking millions of sales and tens 
of thousands of jobs away from the domestic auto makers. Indeed, Honda is now 
vying with Toyota for import sales leadership in the United States and may soon 
sell more cars in this country than Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the car business is an increasingly global industry in which the lines 
between import and domestic are rapidly blurring. General Motors has linked up 
with Toyota, Ford with Mazda and Nissan, Chrysler with Mitsubishi -- and Honda 
now builds hundreds of thousands of its cars in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
So Detroit seems willing to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Significant Individual' 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has become so global that we will be looking for more Japanese to 
include in the future," said Donald Richetti, the president of the Hall of 
Fame, which is based in Midland, Mich. "We want to be an international 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was appropriate that Mr. Honda be the first Japanese," Richetti added. 
"He's a marvelously significant individual who has increased the customer's 
expectations of quality." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the 82-year-old Honda, who founded his company in 1948 amid the rubble of 
postwar Japan, was given a royal welcome when he arrived in the Detroit area 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In this moment of vindication and triumph for a man who never expected to 
challenge the giants of Detroit when he first started making small motorcycles, 
Honda remained effusively gracious -- and very diplomatic -- as he talked to 
reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"My greatest achievement," he said, when asked to look back over his career, 
"was in imitating American cars." 
</P>
<P>
And, when asked how he would compare the quality of American and Japanese cars 
today, he was slightly cryptic. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese and American cars are like humans," Honda said. "Some are good in 
some aspects and some are bad in some aspects." 
</P>
<P>
Honda, who stepped down from active management in 1973, also admitted that he 
still is somewhat awe-struck by the enormous success and global stature that 
his company has enjoyed since he retired. Asked whether he foresees a merger 
between Honda and one of the major auto companies of Detroit, he said, "I know 
in my generation, it would never have happened."

MERCK VENTURE TO BUY PART OF BRITISH DRUG COMPANY

A joint venture of Merck &amp; Co. and health-care products giant Johnson &amp; 
Johnson said they agreed Monday to buy the U.S. non-prescription business of 
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of Great Britain for more than $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition provides the first marketable products for the Johnson &amp; 
Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. joint venture, which was formed in 
March with the intent of establishing a major over-the-counter drug business. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said in March that they would develop the business through 
acquisitions and the development of Merck's prescription medicines, such as the 
ulcer drug Pepcid, for over-the-counter use. 
</P>
<P>
"This automatically makes the joint venture a legitimate business because now 
they have products to sell," said independent pharmaceutical analyst Hemant 
Shah of Warren, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter medicines are an increasingly profitable business for 
pharmaceutical companies because they provide a rich stable cash flow and 
recognizable brand-name products that are not jeopardized by generic "no-name" 
products. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, brand-name pharmaceuticals lose considerable market share to 
low-cost generic competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical giant Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson said they agreed in 
principle to acquire ICI's U.S. over-the-counter drug business, which consists 
mainly of the Mylanta line of antacid products and the Mylicon line of 
anti-flatulence products. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of these products in the United States were about $125 million last year, 
ICI said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, ICI would acquire the U.S. rights to Elavil, which Merck introduced 
in 1961 as a prescription medicine for depression. Last year, Elavil's sales 
were about $25 million, said John Doorley, a Merck spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Base for Growth 
</P>
<P>
The value of the deal is in excess of $450 million, including a substantial 
cash payment to ICI, and is subject to the signing of definitive agreements and 
other considerations, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mylanta and Mylicon lines will give the joint venture a good start and a 
solid base for future growth," said Edward Chase, Johnson &amp; Johnson's 
general manager for the venture. 
</P>
<P>
ICI said in a statement that the agreement follows its decision to pursue 
continued growth in the United States by concentrating on successful 
prescription medicines. It said its over-the-counter business did not fit its 
business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
ICI had worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $2.1 billion and pretax profits of 
$550 million last year. Pharmaceutical sales in the United States last year 
were about $800 million.

Midway to Purchase German Planes: Midway Airlines Inc., a mid-size carrier that 
is expanding rapidly, announced that it has agreed to purchase 33 twin-engine, 
turbo-prop airplanes for $244 million from West German manufacturer Dornier 
Deutsche Aerospace GmbH. Sandra Allen, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Midway, 
said the company has signed a letter of intent to purchase the Dornier 328 
airplanes and holds an option on purchasing an additional 40 of the aircraft, 
which seat 30 people. Allen said the airline will begin accepting delivery of 
the aircraft in April, 1993. The aircraft will replace the Dornier 228, a 
19-seat airplane Midway now uses on its feeder routes into Midway Airport, the 
airline's base of operations on Chicago's Southwest Side.

The Rockefellers want to sell the famed Rockefeller Center; Sears, Roebuck 
&amp; Co. is having trouble selling its Sears Tower. Bloomingdale's, the 
world-renowned retailer, is for sale, along with the real estate on which it 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'hidden values' in real estate have been unhidden, and they're not there," 
says Michael Metz, a market strategist for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate market is suffering from oversupply, but experts say the 
excesses vary widely between second-tier and "trophy" properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a two-tiered market with a vengeance," said David Shulman, a Salomon 
Bros. director in real estate research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Office Building Glut 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about oversupply, Shulman is cautious about the real estate market. 
"There has been a decline in construction, but not anywhere near enough to 
correct the oversupply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While construction will drop further, demand for office space continues to 
fall, he said. Retail space is less in demand because consumers are spending 
less vigorously than they did in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In the avalanche of takeovers and leveraged buyouts in the retail business, 
conventional wisdom held that even if the sales operations were not worth the 
price tag, the stores could always be shuttered and the real estate used for 
more lucrative operations. 
</P>
<P>
But with a glut of office buildings available in the most prestigious areas of 
big cities, these "hidden" values are now looked at more skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
Pension funds and international investors still want real estate. But experts 
say only quality properties need apply. Even for prestige properties, the going 
can get bumpy. Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., the huge Canadian property 
developer, dropped out of talks in Chicago on buying the world's tallest 
building, the Sears Tower, in a deal worth about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
High vacancy rates among office buildings nationwide has made sales of the 
buildings soft as well, since empty buildings are not attractive investments. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has 12% of its office buildings vacant while Miami faces a 21% 
vacancy rate, according to a midyear report by New America Network, a real 
estate group. 
</P>
<P>
What everyone expects to be hit the hardest are the non-trophy, second-tier 
properties. As rents stabilize, such properties lose their cache of low cost. 
In addition, this class has a huge overhang because of the billions of dollars 
in problem real estate assets that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will 
sell under the savings and loan bailout law. 
</P>
<P>
The supply provided by a minimum of $30 billion of these assets going on the 
market will likely depress real estate values, affecting previously unscathed 
real estate markets, analysts at Salomon Bros. concluded recently.

MARKETING: BEER COMPANIES SEND OUT SOBERING MESSAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Lieberman had seen plenty of beer commercials, but not like this one. 
</P>
<P>
The closing scene for the Coors Light beer commercial -- billed as the "Right 
Beer Now" -- shows an apparently drunk man trying to get into his car. 
"Absolutely, positively not now," says a dead serious voice. "No way." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we saw abstinence" advocated in a beer commercial, said 
Lieberman, an associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a 
nonprofit group and a critic of beer marketing practices. "Coors is taking a 
first step by saying that at times not drinking is really the appropriate 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Beer companies are not about to tell consumers to abandon drinking. But the 
brewers are including rather sober messages amid the slick slogans and 
good-looking actors that normally populate industry ads: moderation and 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Public health advocates support such ads, but they say those efforts still fall 
short of what is needed to point out the dangers linked to drinking. And they 
are not so sure that brewers are motivated as much by social responsibility as 
by self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the motivation, some beer makers are spending millions on advertising 
that encourages moderation. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch Co., the nation's largest brewer, spends an estimated $30 
million a year on moderation ads that revolve around its "Know When to Say 
When" campaign. Molson Breweries of Canada said it will spend $16.6 million 
over the next four years on commercials to promote responsible drinking. This 
summer, the rock group the Who appeared in Miller Brewing Co. ads advocating 
responsible drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"There is increased attention to this kind of advertising by beer companies," 
said James Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, a trade group that 
recently began running its own ads touting the industry's moderation campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all increasingly aware of the need for public education," said Sanders. 
"Talking about (alcohol abuse) and instructing people does work. It's paying 
off." 
</P>
<P>
The effort goes beyond advertising. Miller Brewing sponsors bartender training 
programs to teach servers how to identify and deal with patrons who have had 
too much to drink. During a series of parties in Texas, Miller provided free 
coffee to party-goers and free soft drinks to designated drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week, sponsored by Coors 
Brewing Co., will encourage college groups to educate students on alcohol 
abuse. The best programs will receive $1,000 awards. 
</P>
<P>
The campaigns and promotions, however, are not seen by the industry as 
countering their standard ads. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we feel we have to counterbalance something that's bad," said 
Miller spokesman Peter Acly. "We never show people chugging beer. We never show 
underage consumption." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the beer company moderation campaigns, public health advocates point 
out that such advertising amounts to only a tiny portion of the nearly $1 
billion in annual beer advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not be enough," said Clint Hawes, executive director of the National 
Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency. "Maybe it's offset by targeting 
certain groups of people," said Hawes of beer marketing campaigns aimed at 
blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Public health groups and groups representing blacks and Latinos have complained 
that beer companies target minority communities, which already suffer from 
higher-than-average rates of alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't support the idea that the industry is being socially responsible by 
doing that," said Juana Mora, a planner with the Los Angeles County Office of 
Alcohol Programs. "The few moderation messages funded by the industry are not 
going to counteract the stronger message" to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also point out that the commercials often lack useful information and 
may be unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Hawes, citing the "Know When to Say When" campaign, said "the problem is once a 
person starts drinking, the first thing affected is judgment. It's harder to 
know when to say when." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the campaigns also do not mention alcohol-related health problems. 
"We'd really love to see a message that talks about alcohol as a drug, that 
women shouldn't drink during pregnancy, that it causes liver damage," said 
Lieberman, who noted that federal law will require warning labels on alcohol 
beverage containers begining next month. 
</P>
<P>
Lieberman and others claim that there is a surge in such ads when events 
trigger concern about drinking. They said an increase took place this spring 
when former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop criticized beer ads and 
investigators alleged that alcohol abuse was partly to blame in the Alaskan oil 
spill involving the tanker Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has denied such claims and says the ads fall in line with 
society's growing concern about alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing concern, brewers say there is only so much that they can do 
and spend. "It seems like we are maxed out now," said Sanders at the Beer 
Institute. "We are trying to move on every front that we can now to increase 
public education." 
</P>
<P>
"We try not to talk down to people," said Coors spokesman Pat Edson of the 
Coors Light campaign. "It does not say, 'Cut down consumption.' It's just, 
'Here's a situation that's OK to drink and here's one where it's not.' We 
strongly believe it's an individual decision." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College Crowd Fond of Dumpy Guy Teac Ad 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Teac hoped that a new advertising campaign would spur demand for 
its line of stereo sound equipment. But, at least for now, the ads have 
triggered demand for, well, the ads. 
</P>
<P>
College students from UC San Diego to Colgate University in New York have 
called up Teac asking for poster-sized copies of a magazine ad featuring a 
dumpy character and the headline: "Just give me a killer sound system and the 
babes will follow." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really anticipate that this was going to happen," said Scott Waltz, 
an account executive at Hakuhodo Advertising, which created the campaign and is 
in the process of putting out a poster to satisfy requests. 
</P>
<P>
As for sales of Teac equipment, Waltz said the interest in the ads has to help.

 -- The Pillsbury Doughboy Rap 
</P>
<P>
Advertising executives are singing some new tunes to turn on young people, but 
may be running the risk of turning off their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Pillsbury's Doughboy has his own rap song about the joys of crescent rolls 
while a new Burger King radio ad features a song by rapper Tone Loc. 
Tradition-minded Nordstrom used reggae to promote its young men's department. 
SKC Blank Audiotapes uses heavy metal background music on a commercial played 
during MTV's "Headbangers Ball" program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become quite fashionable," said Dain Blair, executive vice president at 
HLC Music, a Los Angeles commercial music house that recently completed a Colt 
45 beer ad featuring rap lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the creative directors at the agencies pick up on these things real 
quick," Blair said. "They want to be whatever the flavor of the month is." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rap or heavy metal music that makes its way into ads is aimed at 
young consumers. A survey of music consumers by Street Pulse Group, a music 
marketing firm, showed that 40% of 18- to 20-year-olds "like" or "strongly 
like" rap and 36% had the same feelings about heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
"SKC Audiotape was trying to reach 12- to 17-year-olds," said Julie Clinard, an 
account supervisor at the Gary Group, a Venice-based entertainment ad agency. 
"And heavy metal is very popular among 12- to 17-year-olds. We needed to go 
with a type of music in our advertising campaign that would appeal to them." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just another method of delivering a message," said Blair, who notes that 
rap music is well suited for delivering commercial messages. "It definitely has 
a way of capturing the audience and delivering a message that can be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
But the popularity of rap and heavy metal drops dramatically with older 
consumers. Only 20% of 25- to 34-year-olds "like" or "strongly like" heavy 
metal, for instance. Rap has even fewer fans among a more mature audience -- 
only 13% in the same age group registered a strong liking for the music. 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments mean that advertisers often have to be very careful about not 
offending consumers with the wrong choice of music. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not in sync with the music played on a radio station, you can make 
listeners mad and that runs counter to what you are trying to accomplish," said 
Miles Turpin, chairman of the Western division of Grey Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to use heavy metal with a product that has already established 
its image," said Clinard, who noted that her audio tape client was an unknown 
brand in the United States when its guitar screeching commercials made their 
debut a year ago. "Heavy metal is too risky for Coca-Cola," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, consumers and advertisers are more willing to accept a wider variety of 
music, said Susan Ball, who handles Pillsbury advertising as account supervisor 
at the ad agency Leo Burnett USA. Opera, for example, has been used to promote 
detergent, said Ball. 
</P>
<P>
Ball said the Doughboy Rap -- "It's pretty cute and has a nice beat to it" -- 
met with ready acceptance with conservative executives at Pillsbury's 
Minneapolis headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an open-minded client," said Ball. "But heavy metal would have 
probably raised their eyebrows in Minneapolis." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Commercials Take to the Silver Screen 
</P>
<P>
If you're the type of movie goer who doesn't mind watching commercials before 
the main feature, you'll love this. The winners of the 1989 Clio Awards -- the 
best television and radio commercials and print ads selected during an annual 
international competition -- will be screened at the Wilshire Ebell Theater on 
Thursday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The single Los Angeles screening is open to the public. For ticket prices and

It isn't the love of money that is the root of all business evils, say a 
growing number of executives and management experts. It is the love of 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Inventory -- supplies for production, work in progress or finished goods ready 
to be shipped -- ties up needed cash, costs money to be stored and hides 
quality and production problems. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, say executives from such large corporations as General Motors 
Corp. to smaller, job-oriented shops such as Cockeysville, Md.-based M. S. 
Willet Inc., is to weed out inventory using "just in time" systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Just in time" technology permits a company to receive materials just in time 
to turn them into products, then finish those products just in time to meet 
customers' deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Toyota in the early 1960s, JIT was adopted by some U.S. companies 
suffering from Japanese competition in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, for example, Harley-Davidson Inc. was struggling in a motorcycle 
market increasingly dominated by Yamaha, Kawasaki and Honda. So the United 
States' last remaining motorcycle maker threw out its bidding system for 
suppliers and gave long-term contracts to a few proven suppliers who promised 
to deliver one day's worth of materials each morning to its York, Pa., final 
assembly plant. 
</P>
<P>
Harley also rearranged the production line to reduce work in progress, cut 
setup time on machines to increase flexibility and dropped lot sizes from 25 
motorcycles to one so that each day's production matched that day's orders from 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Harley spokeswoman Kathyrn Molling said JIT saved the motorcycle maker by 
slashing costs while dramatically improving quality. For example, the company 
was able to sell 44 of its 50 forklifts because of the reduction in material 
handling. At the same time, it reduced defects discovered at final inspection 
by 70%, because JIT slows down some production processes to allow greater 
inspection, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helps Keep Clients 
</P>
<P>
Common now among the nation's biggest manufacturers, JIT is increasingly being 
adopted by smaller companies, said Richard Dickensheets, production manager for 
M. S. Willet. 
</P>
<P>
Dickensheets said many job shops like Willet, a 50-year-old machining company, 
have developed JIT systems in order to keep as clients such JIT boosters as 
Harley-Davidson and Black &amp; Decker Corp. 
</P>
<P>
And Willet is pushing JIT on its suppliers to reduce its own inventory, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to find good vendors all the time," Dickensheets said. 
</P>
<P>
But JIT is no panacea. Because they are not considered important customers, 
some small firms may have difficulty getting suppliers to agree to daily 
deliveries of materials and may have to keep large inventories of materials on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
And companies selling to or supplied by unstable markets should probably not 
risk drastic reduction of inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Also, firms that already have excellent records in quality, worker relations 
and on-time delivery records may not be willing to bear the costs of 
reshuffling inventory and production systems, explained Janice Klein, a Harvard 
Business School professor who specializes in JIT research. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal in JIT production "is to have the company work like a robot," she 
said. But people are not robots. "They each do things a little differently. JIT 
wants to take out the variability so everything is exactly the same. That means 
taking away the workers' freedom to do things differently." 
</P>
<P>
But nearly any firm that has a fairly predictable customer and supply base can 
apply JIT concepts -- such as reducing inventories to ensure that bottlenecks 
and failures are revealed and fixed correctly -- to reduce long-term costs and 
improve quality, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
"JIT is a philosophy. It makes sense no matter where you are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The most important difference between large and small companies' shifts to JIT 
may be where they introduce it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change Takes Time 
</P>
<P>
Big firms often start with the least internally painful and most immediately 
rewarding aspect by forcing suppliers to deliver only what they need when they 
need it. 
</P>
<P>
Starting a JIT purchasing system requires time, scrupulous planning and careful 
negotiations with suppliers, said Tim Lewis, a purchasing expert with the 
Cambridge, Mass.-based JIT consulting firm Rath &amp; Strong. 
</P>
<P>
Paring down a 30-to 60-day supply level to a one-day supply takes years and 
starts with careful analyses of the firm's purchasing patterns and the firm's 
suppliers, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The company must know what its daily or weekly demands are for each part. Once 
its needs are established, the company should evaluate potential suppliers for 
their administrative talent, fiscal strength, inventories, delivery systems, 
quality levels, lead times and prices, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
In each case the most reliable, not necessarily the cheapest, supplier is given 
a long-term contract to supply the part on a schedule determined by the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
These negotiations should turn purchasing -- which has traditionally rested 
upon adversarial relationships with suppliers -- into a partnership with 
vendors, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with your suppliers is quite an advantage," he said. Even though 
competition for each part is reduced, most of his clients see their purchasing 
costs decline by from 6% to 20%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the supplier is converted to JIT, the company must convince its own 
workers that JIT will work. Company insiders are often harder to convince than 
outside suppliers, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"The person in the stockroom says, 'I got in trouble the last time I ran out of 
this, so I have got to order more,' " Lewis said, explaining that internal 
politics can ruin the system. "It can be very territorial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Merely Shifts Costs 
</P>
<P>
A JIT purchasing system alone can cut inventory costs in half, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But often, those savings are often accrued only by pushing costs onto suppliers 
or truckers, said Bruce Kennedy, a vice president for marketing for Preston 
Trucking. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in the mid-1980s, Kennedy saw an increasing number of clients demand 
daily deliveries and attempt to "shift inventory costs onto us and their 
suppliers." 
</P>
<P>
Preston tries to fight the profit squeeze by "striving to show customers what 
is happening to our costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the regional trucking company started offering a higher-priced JIT 
program that uses radio-equipped trucks and guarantees next-day delivery to 
meet burgeoning demand for the quicker, smaller shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Because of supplier opposition, many companies, both large and small, start JIT 
systems inside their own plants and try to reduce inventory of their own work 
in progress and finished goods waiting for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
JIT experts say the best way to ensure the company is finishing the right 
products on the right day is to start at the final operation -- such as 
assembly or packing -- and work backward. 
</P>
<P>
When the workers at the final operation need more of a certain product, they 
should walk back to the preceding operation and "order" whatever is needed. 
Workers should only produce to fill the orders from those ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the traditional "push" or supply-driven system is transformed into a 
"pull" or demand-driven system.

VOTE MAY DECIDE FATE OF EASTERN'S PILOTS; 
</P>
<P>
BALLOTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER UNION CONTINUES STRIKE BENEFITS

A nationwide vote of pilots to be counted today could be the proverbial last 
straw for Eastern Airlines' pilots, who have entered their eighth month of a 
bitter strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn. ballot on continuing strike payments to the Eastern 
pilots, if negative, would withdraw financial support from the beleaguered 
strikers and force them to pull down their picket lines after numerous setbacks 
in their fight against Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an upcoming Senate vote on Eastern could turn into a 
disappointment for the striking pilots, machinists and flight attendants if 
their request for an investigative commission is defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The 40,000 or so ALPA members were balloted last month on whether they wished 
to keep paying about 3% of their wages to their colleagues at Miami-based 
Eastern, which is trying to emerge from bankruptcy protection as a smaller 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits to Eastern pilots 
averaging around $2,400 a month each since the walkout began on March 4. But 
the number of pilots paying those special assessments has decreased as the 
strike has worn on, according to ALPA, which represents pilots at nearly all 
the nation's major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
If the ALPA vote is negative, "It would be in everyone's best interest to go 
about their business and relocate to other airlines," said Louis A. Marckesano, 
an airline analyst at the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Results Due Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
"I think the strike basically is over," he said Monday. "Neither side has won; 
they've just sort of mortally wounded each other." 
</P>
<P>
The mail-in ballots, which had to be postmarked by midnight on Sept. 25, are 
expected to be counted today and the results announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline would have no comment on 
the matter until after the vote had been announced, and ALPA spokesman John 
Mazor in Washington was unavailable because of the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The striking Eastern pilots, whose ranks have dwindled to around 2,400 from 
3,600 when the walkout began, remained defiant. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident," said Skip Copeland, head of the Eastern pilots union. Asked 
what might occur if the majority of ALPA members vote to stop the payments, he 
replied: "It can't happen; I can't even give that any consideration. If Lorenzo 
were able to beat us, there's no telling who's next." 
</P>
<P>
Copeland conceded that the vote likely won't be 100% in favor of sustaining the 
benefits, but he insisted that the majority will opt to do so. If the pilots 
abandoned their Eastern colleagues, ALPA's bargaining position with all the 
carriers would be weakened, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot leader cited strong support, especially from counterparts at United 
Airlines and Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Wreck Morale 
</P>
<P>
Also this week, the Senate could vote on a bill, supported by the pilots, to 
set up a commission that would investigate the Eastern dispute. In a cloture 
vote last week, the Senate decided to cut off debate on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House and the Transportation Department have lobbied heavily 
against the bill, and President Bush is likely to veto it. In that case, if 
Congress couldn't muster the votes to override his veto, the pilots could 
suffer another crushing blow to morale.

Japan's giant trading company and Iran have reached a basic accord to end their 
partnership for a long-stalled multibillion-dollar joint petrochemical project 
in southern Iran, the Japanese partner reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui &amp; Co. said the agreement was contained in a joint communique issued 
Sunday in Tehran by Koichiro Ejiri, president of Mitsui, and Ahmad Rahgozar, 
president of the Iranian National Petrochemical Co. 
</P>
<P>
Ejiri estimated the amount of compensation to be paid by the Mitsui Group at 
between $857 million (120 billion yen) and $929 million (130 billion yen), the 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Ejiri was in Tehran to negotiate with Rahgozar on terms for Mitsui to withdraw 
from the project, which had been stalled by the protracted Iran-Iraq war. A 
cease-fire was negotiated in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement confirmed both sides will dissolve the partnership," a spokesman 
for the Japanese trading company said. "The agreement has yet to be signed 
formally." 
</P>
<P>
The official said the accord calls for the Mitsui Group to pay compensation for 
its withdrawal from the project, but he declined to give any figures.

VALLEY HOUSING RESALE PRICES REACH NEW HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The average resale price of a house in the San Fernando Valley inched up to 
another record of $311,900 in September, less than 1% higher than August's 
previous record of $311,000, the San Fernando Board of Realtors said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figure marked an 18% rise from the $264,000 average resale price set 
in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
September's volume of house sales jumped 11% from August, reaching 1,025, 
compared to 923 in August. But the number of houses sold was still 28% lower 
than the previous September, when 1,413 houses were resold. 
</P>
<P>
The average resale price of a condominium also was up by 1% in September to 
$151,800, from $150,200 in August. That was 14% higher than the September, 
1988, average of $133,200. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales climbed 38% to 408 in September, from 295 in August. About 
7% fewer condominiums were resold last month than during the previous 
September, when there were 440 resales. 
</P>
<P>
The combined number of houses and condominiums available for sale in the Valley 
hit a record high of 11,245 in September. But the total number of houses for 
sale edged up only slightly in the month, rising 1% to 9,397 from 9,276 in 
August. That still marked a 63% increase over September, 1988, when only about 
5,763 houses were on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The realty board said that the combination of rebounding sales and slowly 
rising prices indicated that the housing market in the Valley was finally 
moderating from the record sales pace and price appreciation of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, for instance, the average house price 
has climbed about 11%, compared to a 27% rise for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of houses sold was up 11% from August, the realty board's 
vice president, Jim Link, said, "This is the kind of sales volume we'd expect 
to see in a normal year." 
</P>
<P>
Rates on standard, fixed-rate 30-year mortgages were largely unchanged during 
the month, with most banks and S&amp;Ls in the area offering house loans at 
about 10% to 11%. 
</P>
<P>
The board also suggested the market was becoming more of a buyers' market. 
"Last year, listings were scarce, yet buyers appeared overnight to fight over 
every listing," said Buddy Bernard, the board's president. "This year, listings 
are falling from the sky, while buyers are not nearly so abundant." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and 
condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its 
statistics do not include most new residences, which generally are not sold by 
real estate agents, or sales by homeowners who sell their homes without agents.

TINY BANK SEEKS AN EDGE BY OPENING ON SUNDAYS; 
</P>
<P>
"AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY GOD ENDED HIS WORK . . ." -- THE BOOK OF GENESIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
God might have rested on the seventh day, but Jack D. Seefus thinks Sundays are 
no time for relaxation in the banking business. 
</P>
<P>
Seefus is president of Antelope Valley Bank, a small, Lancaster-based community 
bank. Beginning Nov. 5, he plans to open the bank's six offices for four hours 
each Sunday. The bank already has been open Saturdays, and each weekday of 
course, since its founding in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for the past few years Seefus has operated branch offices in two 
Antelope Valley supermarkets (in Mojave and Rosamond), and plans to add more 
such outlets. Some of Seefus' four other branches -- two in Lancaster and one 
each in Palmdale and Acton -- are furnished with oak antiques and fireplaces to 
make them more inviting. 
</P>
<P>
He's also toying with the idea of placing big-screen televisions near his 
tellers to distract customers from their wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Anything to make the bank stand apart from its competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The world of banking today revolves around marketing," said Seefus, who claims 
that his bank, despite having a relatively small $120 million in assets, is 
still the biggest in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Demographics 
</P>
<P>
Seefus, 54, said his bank will be open Sundays because of the changing 
demographics of the Lancaster-Palmdale area, where thousands have moved in 
recent years mainly because of the region's inexpensive real estate. 
</P>
<P>
He estimates that 25% of the area's residents now commute 50 miles or more to 
work in the San Fernando Valley or other parts of Los Angeles, leaving them no 
time before or after work to go to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The demographics have changed to the point of where we're a bedroom 
community," he said. "Saturday is now the biggest day we have." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday is a popular grocery-store day, Seefus said, and "we want to be where 
the customers are." 
</P>
<P>
But John Stocksdale, manager of First Interstate's Palmdale branch, dismissed 
Seefus' plan to open Sundays as unnecessary and costly. "We feel it's going to 
be just a very expensive proposition for them, with them picking up limited 
additional revenues," Stocksdale said. "They have to do it to try to compete 
with us majors. We have no immediate plans to do anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
A bank open on Sunday was once unthinkable, but selling bank services these 
days is little different than peddling soap or toothpaste. The deregulation of 
the financial industry -- which now enables banks, savings and loans and other 
financial entities to offer similar services at similar prices -- has forced 
banks to keep finding new marketing gimmicks that will attract customers' 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bank Giveaways 
</P>
<P>
Banks and S&amp;Ls have long given away toasters or offered no-fee checking 
accounts, particularly to big depositors or new customers. But lately even big 
banks have tried to persuade the public that they're concerned about service to 
all comers. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for instance, Wells Fargo Bank guaranteed a $5 payment to customers 
each time they had to wait longer than five minutes in line. First Interstate 
Bank of California ($21 billion-plus in assets) shot back by extending the $5 
guarantee to each time the bank makes errors in their statements or their 
automatic-teller-machine (ATM) transactions are fouled up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seefus wasn't the first to think about doing banking business on Sundays. Some 
banks in Georgia already are open Sundays, and Fremont Bank, a community bank 
based in Fremont north of San Jose, also plans to start Sunday hours next 
month. The Sunday hours will apply only at eight new branches that Fremont 
plans to open in supermarkets over the next year, said Robert David, the bank's 
marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
For little banks such as Antelope Valley or Fremont, which has $220 million in 
assets, service is everything. They constantly try to attract business by 
showing that, unlike the local branch of a huge, bureaucracy-laden big bank, 
they respond better to customers' needs. The big banks, of course, dispute that 
the community banks have any advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Antelope Valley and Fremont argue that putting branches in supermarkets 
is a low-cost way of generating revenue. Using only two or three employees per 
outlet, both banks use the supermarket branches to make loans as well as take 
deposits and cash checks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's low overhead and a lot of volume," said Seefus, whose bank employs 170 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Seefus knows banking both big and small. An Omaha, Neb., native, he moved to 
Los Angeles in 1957 to work for Citizens National Bank, which later became 
Crocker Bank, which has since been merged into Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opened Branch 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Seefus opened Crocker's branch office in Lancaster, but in 1981 he 
joined with several other local business people to start Antelope Valley Bank. 
Ironically, his office is in a building that formerly was a Wells Fargo branch. 
Seefus owns less than 5% of Antelope Valley's stock, which is not publicly 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
After earning $756,000 in 1985, Antelope Valley's profits dropped to $459,000 
and $519,000 in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Seefus blamed the skid on a costly 
conversion to a new computer system and some problem loans to small businesses. 
But last year, the bank's earnings climbed back up to $916,000, which gave it a 
strong return on average assets of 0.92%. The return measures how profitably a 
bank manages the assets at its disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, it is questionable how long a small bank such as Antelope Valley 
can remain independent. In 1991, non-California banks will be allowed to 
purchase banks in the state, and in all other areas of the country where 
interstate banking has been allowed, there has been a wave of consolidation. 
The same figures to be true in California as banks from the East use mergers to 
expand in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Possibility 
</P>
<P>
"Informally, we're looking at that as a possibility" for Antelope Valley, 
Seefus said. "But we're not hoping it happens. If it happened, I would probably 
turn around and start another independent community bank." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Seefus will be trying to drum up business on Sundays. Will the 
major banks follow him? Larry Kurmel, executive director of the California 
Bankers Assn., an industry trade group, doubts it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's evidence of a trend there, or even demand" by customers 
for Sunday hours industrywide, Kurmel said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Antelope Valley, at least, Seefus predicted that the banks 
eventually will follow his lead. Noting that Antelope Valley Bank began 
Saturday hours several years before the big banks latched onto the idea last 
spring, he said, "Just give them six years."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: DEBT RATING LOWERED FOR MICROPOLIS CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Micropolis Corp.'s "significantly diminished" cash levels have led Standard 
&amp; Poor's to lower its rating of Micropolis' convertible subordinated 
debentures -- a type of debt security -- to triple-C from single-B-minus. 
</P>
<P>
Micropolis is a Chatsworth-based maker of computer disk drives that has been 
struggling for the past year. The upshot of S&amp;P's action is that, should 
Micropolis borrow money in the future, it likely would have to pay a higher 
interest rate to compensate investors for the perceived increased risk of the 
company's ability to repay its debts. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the rating cut, S&amp;P noted there "are no assets to be sold and 
no operations that could easily be spun off to raise cash," and that its new 
rating assumes "that alternate sources of liquidity will become available 
beginning in 1990."

JOURNALISTS FLEE COLOMBIA FOR U.S. SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The soldiers came to Olga Behar's apartment in late 1985, shortly after she 
published an uncompromising book, now in its 11th edition, on the four decades 
of political violence that had racked her native Colombia. Behar, a television 
and newspaper reporter who has won Colombia's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, 
was away at the time but the search of her home -- purportedly for weapons -- 
crystallized her free-floating suspicion and distrust into rock-hard fear. 
</P>
<P>
For Mauricio Gomez the signs were less concrete but equally disturbing. At 
least twice, the former television anchorman and news director of the national 
TV news program "24 Hours" says he was followed around Bogota, apparently by 
minions of drug dealers he had been covering. Strangers asked questions about 
him at his apartment building. His home phone rang at odd hours. The callers 
never spoke more than a sentence but it was more than enough: "Congratulations, 
you also will be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Behar and Gomez, colleagues who once worked together on "24 Hours," chose to 
leave Colombia, where the homicide rate was seven times greater than that of 
the United States even before the latest round of bombings and shootings in 
that country's cocaine war. They are among an estimated 40 or more Colombian 
journalists who have fled the country in recent years out of fear for their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Behar estimates that about five Colombian journalists have come to this 
country, including Fabio Castillo, author of a book about drug lords called 
"The Cocaine Jockeys," who is in deep hiding in the eastern United States and 
makes only rare public appearances. Other Colombian journalists -- including 
Daniel Samper, brother of a presidential candidate Ernesto Samper -- have fled 
to France, Spain, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Behar and Gomez say they intend to return, they concede that 
moment is two or three years away, at best. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Behar, who is a fellow this year at USC's Center for 
International Journalism, says she tries to live as normally as possible. At 
the moment normality means filing commentaries via her portable computer from 
her Los Angeles apartment to El Mundo, a newspaper in Medellin, the heart of 
Colombian drug dealer country. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't assume the way of living of an exile, always dreaming of going back," 
she explains. "You ask an exile, 'Why don't you buy a television set?' and the 
exile says, 'No, no I'm going home very soon.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immigration Ban Lifted 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Behar, who had been living in Mexico, almost didn't make it to USC 
because her name turned up in the so-called "Lookout Book," a secret list of 
aliens prohibited from U.S. entry. The list is maintained by the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. After vociferous protests from center director 
Murray Fromson and the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights, the 
ban on her was lifted last month but the reasons for Behar's inclusion in the 
book remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
During her reporting career in Colombia, Behar covered the M-19 guerrilla 
organization, one of a half-dozen armed groups active throughout the country. 
She has written two books about her country's political turmoil, "The Wars of 
Peace" and "Night of Smoke," both critical of military conduct and including 
documentation of human rights abuses, she says. Behar suspects that her contact 
with government opponents as well as her writings led to her being put on the 
U.S. list at the request of the Colombian government. She notes also that 
circumstantial evidence indicates she was placed in the "Lookout Book" about 
the time a Colombian government delegation was visiting Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Helton of the lawyers committee says that being listed in the lookout 
book can be dangerous because it can be used by enemies as evidence that the 
person listed is politically suspect, perhaps even subversive. 
</P>
<P>
Helton, who went to bat for Behar, is also representing Patricia Lara, another 
Colombian journalist barred from this country, who remains in Colombia. Lara 
apparently has been kept out of the United States because she too had contacts 
with Colombian guerrilla leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Helton won a court order for an unprecedented look at the the 
list. Although he hasn't seen the list yet, Helton says early indications are 
that it contains at least 327,200 names. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with Behar and Lara, Gomez's problems are straightforward. A former 
news director and anchorman and the son of a former diplomat, Gomez had no 
problem coming to this country early last year. He lives in Atlanta where he 
has been working, off and on, for Cable News Network. "I had plans a month and 
a half ago to get back to Colombia by early next year, but now I know I can't 
go back because, definitely, things have gotten worse," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The synergism of politics and drug crime have made journalism dangerous work in 
Colombia for much of this decade. A recent study by the Committee to Protect 
Journalists, a global organization that monitors threats to press freedom, 
reported that 16 Colombian editors and reporters had been slain since January, 
1984 -- by far the highest toll in Latin America. Just last month a part-time 
reporter was killed when more than 200 pounds of dynamite heavily damaged the 
offices of El Spectador, one of Colombia's most important newspapers. Last 
March El Spectador columnist Hector Giraldo Galvez was shot dead, apparently by 
drug dealers. And last week, El Spectador's president said the paper may be 
forced to close because some smaller advertisers had pulled out and the daily 
had begun losing money. 
</P>
<P>
The current round of violence has become so acute that former Colombian justice 
minister Monica de Greiff is thought to be in hiding in this country. De Greiff 
resigned last month after repeated threats against the lives of herself and her 
family by drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences of Behar and Gomez offer one measure of the pervasiveness of 
violence and intimidation within Colombian society. Both say that they had 
grown accustomed to telephone and other verbal threats and left the country 
only after the threats had escalated into overt actions against them. 
</P>
<P>
Although Colombia's then-President Belisario Betancourt apologized on 
television for the military raid on her apartment, Behar says that she decided 
to leave the country after the president told her in person that he could not 
protect her life. 
</P>
<P>
While Behar has no idea just who her shadowy enemies are, Gomez says that in 
the course of his work he apparently angered one of Colombia's top three drug 
kings, Jorge Luis Ochoa, also known as El Gordo, the Fat One. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left Colombia in February, 1988, Gomez's life began to resemble 
episodes from seemingly far-fetched Latin American novels such as those by 
Nobel Prize-winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez, another former Colombian journalist 
who has long been in exile in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, not long after Gomez left Colombia, his father, a former 
presidential candidate and ambassador to the United States, was kidnaped by the 
M-19 guerrillas and held for two months before being released unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Gomez, who edits a paper called El Siglo, was fortunate, his son 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who are kidnaped you don't hear from the anymore," he says, 
"and if you do, you find them dead."

ART BUCHWALD: JUSTICE'S WHEELS ROLL PAST HUBCAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first victim of violent crime in this country is victimless crime. With all 
the mayhem that is going on in the streets these days, one can't expect the 
police to get too excited about a stolen pair of silver candlesticks or a 
television set. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Andrews discovered this when the hubcaps were stolen off her Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Red-faced and steaming mad she marched down to the 85th precinct and declared, 
"I wish to report a crime." 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant was holding a drug-pusher's head on his desk with one hand while 
he searched the man's pants with the other. Then he pushed him in the direction 
of another officer and said to Vivian, "What kind of crime?" 
</P>
<P>
"Someone stole my hubcaps." 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant looked at her to make sure that she wasn't kidding and said, "We 
don't do hubcaps." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean 'you don't do hubcaps?' " 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped doing them years ago, about the same time that we decided not to do 
anything about stolen television sets, car stereos and silver candlesticks." 
</P>
<P>
"A crime is a crime," Vivian protested. "Those hubcaps mean as much to me as 
stolen cash means to a bank." 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant threw a glass paperweight at a mugger who was being booked and 
shouted, "Tell him to shut up." He then turned to Vivian. "Please don't think 
that the police are cold and heartless about hubcaps. It's just that when it 
comes to serving the community, we can't give hubcaps the same priority we give 
to a drug lord being gunned down in the street. 
</P>
<P>
"In normal times we might even send someone over to fingerprint your car, and 
try to match the prints against every known convict in the city. But these are 
not normal times." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the FBI?" Vivian wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI can only intervene if the hubcaps are transported across state lines. 
They have problems, too. They're using their entire force to guard Felix Bloch, 
and so they decided several months ago to cut back on solving hubcap crimes." 
</P>
<P>
"You people really don't care about petty crime any more. All you're interested 
in is stuff that can put you on the evening news." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true. We're really falling behind these days, and if we rounded up 
every hubcap thief in town, we would never catch the few people who deserve to 
be locked up." With that the sergeant whacked a fly with his night stick. 
</P>
<P>
"So what are you going to do?" Vivian asked again. 
</P>
<P>
"Lady," the sergeant told her, "I am going to make out a report on your hubcaps 
and put it in a file with stolen fur coats, credit cards and punch bowls." 
</P>
<P>
Vivian was impressed. "Here's the form. When can I expect you to catch the 
thief and return my hubcaps?" 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant looked at his calendar. "Let's see, today is Tuesday. I won't be 
able to get the entire precinct on the case until Wednesday. We'll put out an 
all-points bulletin this afternoon, so let's say we'll crack your case by 
Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Vivian said, "That seems more than fair. My friends warned me that with the 
increase in crime you wouldn't be able to solve the theft until next week."

STORIES EXPLORE THE VARIETY OF RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After You've Gone: Stories by Alice Adams (Knopf: $18.95; 220 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
Though these stories are tenuously related by a preoccupation with themes of 
parting, loss and separation, the ways in which Alice Adams' characters cope 
with change, or sometimes with the mere idea of change, lends each one a 
particular distinction. The author is concerned with the varieties of response 
that similar circumstances can elicit, and while her people may seem to 
confront analogous situations, their reactions range from stoicism to despair, 
with stops at every emotional way station in between. 
</P>
<P>
The title story effectively sets the mood. We're listening to a woman attorney 
describing the first few painful months after her poet lover has decamped for 
an Oregon houseboat with his latest young infatuate. The narrator's tone is 
cool and composed, rueful but not self-pitying. She is, after all, a lawyer, 
adept at making the best of unwelcome facts by setting them down and analyzing 
the possibilities. For a while, she tells us, "I managed very well indeed, 
coping with the house and its curious breakages" -- all the major and minor 
appliances, from car to Cuisinart, disintegrating the moment the poet is no 
longer in residence, as if love were the engine that ran them. 
</P>
<P>
There's no logic in this, but the symbolism is inescapable. Their mutual 
friends present another problem, either too eagerly sympathetic, altogether 
indifferent, or noticeably partisan. Nights are bleak, even though she had 
never believed the relationship would last forever, only that the first two 
years were the test. Easily, she admits missing his creative cooking, not 
flinching from the knowledge that "cooking" covers every aspect of domesticity. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she keeps her equilibrium until the letters from the new lady love 
begin to arrive -- requests for advice on how to please the man she's charmed 
away from the storyteller. The letters are pathetic and unsettling, coming just 
as the lawyer is beginning to reassemble her own life. She's played the role of 
deserted woman with dignity -- must she now be her successor's mentor? 
</P>
<P>
"1940: Fall" is a fictional memoir of the year in which a high school girl 
first becomes aware of the anguished world beyond the tranquillity of Madison, 
Wis. Her consciousness is raised by a refugee boy whose anti-Nazi father had 
been one of the earliest casualties of the war. The story briskly moves forward 
to the present, when that Midwestern teen-ager, now a mature and respected 
psychologist, is dining alone in a San Diego restaurant, the common fate of 
woman authors on promotional tours. Of course the man at the next table is Egon 
Heller, the refugee in her high school class. Like her, he's reached 
distinguished late middle age, and with a bit of prompting, he recognizes her, 
but not the crucial role he played in her maturation. 
</P>
<P>
"What to Wear" is a remarkable tour de force, showing what a skilled writer can 
do with the scenario of a woman deciding on an appropriate outfit for a special 
occasion. Make the woman a professor of literature, the occasion her visit to a 
lover in a mental hospital, and you've turned an apparently banal dilemma into 
a psychological drama revealing everything relevant to these two people. 
</P>
<P>
There's a perceptible feminist undertow to these stories, a slight but 
noticeable pull that becomes apparent only when you're standing safely on the 
shore. Adams specializes in admirable women hopelessly involved with unworthy 
men; virtues and flaws taking sophisticated forms and shapes, appearing in 
various degrees. The stories are non-judgmental, but there's no mistaking just 
which party is generally left to cope, grieve and adjust after the defection of 
the other. While Adams never actually disparages her male characters, she lets 
them bare the less agreeable sides of their personalities, while the women glow 
with courage, understanding and resilience -- sometimes only by contrast, but 
that's enough.

YOUR BODY: PERSONAL HEALTH; 
</P>
<P>
INDOOR EXERCISE REGIMEN IS CLIFF-HANGER FOR THE BORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, Doheny is a free-lancer who writes about health and 
behavior for View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are you so bored with your exercise routine that you could climb the wall? Hang 
on. And don't forget your rope. 
</P>
<P>
Indoor rock-climbing walls will be the next attraction at Southern California 
gyms, industry insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
The gigantic fiberglass walls come complete with realistic craters, grooves and 
hand holds. Look for them somewhere between the exercise bikes and the aerobics 
studio within the next six months, says one manufacturer who's closing a deal 
with a local gym. 
</P>
<P>
A natural spinoff from the skyrocketing popularity of outdoor climbing, indoor 
walls are already popular in some Washington and Oregon health clubs. And club 
owners hope the indoor versions will add spice to workouts and draw in 
rainy-day aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
But Southland athletic stores are getting in on the action, too. Go Sport in 
Glendale, for instance, installed a 16-by-16-foot fiberglass climbing wall soon 
after opening late last year. Experienced climbers can test shoes and other 
climbing gear; novices can sign up for lessons, reassured by the cushy floor 
mat below. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have a climbing class, it draws a crowd," says manager Mark Erwin. 
</P>
<P>
How does climbing stack up as exercise? "You can derive definite improvement in 
muscular strength," says John Duncan, associate director of exercise physiology 
at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
That's the upside. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the downside: The amount of time spent in isometric contractions 
required to pull yourself up, Duncan says, "might be long enough to provoke an 
abnormal rise in blood pressure for people with hypertensive problems or heart 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to safety, though, indoor climbers might have a toehold over 
outdoor types. Despite improvement in equipment and increased emphasis on 
proper instructions, climbing injuries have increased along with the sport's 
popularity. Compared with 25 years ago, one climbing club reports three times 
as many injured climbers, and one study found twice the number of 
climbing-related deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
But no one has even been hurt seriously on an indoor wall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sleepy-Time Tape 
</P>
<P>
Widespread debate over the ill-effects of sleeping pills has spurred some 
insomniacs to search for other slumber routes such as self-help tapes that 
teach relaxation skills and the fine art of healthy sleeping. Growing numbers 
of sleep tapes are sold through book stores and mail order. 
</P>
<P>
These self-help tapes can work, concludes an Australian researcher. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 159 otherwise healthy insomniacs ages 23-60, David Morawetz, of 
La Trobe University, compared self-help tapes, therapist-led treatment and a 
control group. His conclusion, published in Behavior Therapy, found the 
self-help tapes work for insomniacs who weren't on sleeping pills. But 
insomniacs on sleeping pills slept better if they supplemented their self-help 
tapes with professional assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stevenson, a sleep disorder specialist in North Valley Sleep Disorder 
Center in Mission Hills and a consultant for a self-help tape for insomniacs, 
agrees. "As insomniacs withdraw from sleeping pills, the insomnia worsens," he 
says. The best self-help tapes teach insomniacs how to relax and how to 
associate the bedroom with pleasant, rather than negative thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out With the Lens 
</P>
<P>
Nearsighted swimmers won't do back flips over this advice: Remove your soft 
contact lenses before hitting the beach or pool. 
</P>
<P>
Though lenses can provide some protection from chlorine irritation, a growing 
number of contact lens specialists worry that swimmers not only risk lens loss 
but increase their chances of infection from floating microorganisms -- even in 
chlorinated pools. 
</P>
<P>
Prescription goggles are the best bet for nearsighted swimmers, says Dr. 
Carolyn Begley, assistant professor of optometry at Indiana University in 
Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
For those stubborn wearers who won't leave their lenses pool side, Begley 
advises: "Put four to six drops of pool water in each eye to make the lenses 
stick." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with Begley's unorthodox advice. Says Dr. Jay Schlanger, a 
Los Angeles optometrist: I wouldn't advise putting pool water in the eyes. 
There's a potential for infection, however small." 
</P>
<P>
But swimmers use Begley's method should disinfect their lenses after swimming, 
but not right away. Wait 20 minutes or so to let the lenses stop sticking, 
Begley advises. Removing them too soon could damage the cornea slightly, 
increasing the risk of infection.

TOKYO STRING QUARTET OPENS COLEMAN SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tokyo String Quartet celebrated its 20th anniversary season on Sunday with 
a concert for the Coleman Chamber Music Assn., whose annual competition, a 
major event in those days, the Tokyo won in 1969, setting the stage for the 
group's dazzling international career. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ensemble's appearance on Sunday in Beckman Auditorium at Caltech 
provided a muted, decidedly non-festive opening for this season's series of 
Coleman Concerts. The group was well below its best form in a drab program that 
began with an expendable, overlong piece of Schubert juvenilia, his Quartet in 
C, D. 32. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, spirits -- the audience's and the players' -- hardly soared on 
the wings of the Quartet in A, the most conventional segment of Beethoven's 
Opus 18. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is hardly the salon trifle these artists made it out to be in their 
orderly, soft-grained presentation. A measure of rhythmic intensity, greater 
variety of tone -- bland sweetness was pervasive -- would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
Ravel, in his Quartet in F, gave performers every opportunity for displays of 
temperament and technical finesse. But the Tokyo members -- violinists Peter 
Oundjian and Kikuei Ikeda, violist Kazuhide Isomura, cellist Sadao Harada -- 
remained stubbornly resistant to its blandishments on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Their underemphatic interpretation was, furthermore, riddled with 
uncharacteristic mechanical lapses. Most damaging were the imbalances that made 
the second violin all but disappear from the opening movement and instances of 
mis-intonation from the first violinist and, more frequently, the violist. 
</P>
<P>
It was simply not the Tokyo String Quartet's day. HERBERT GLASS

Menahem Pressler is perhaps best known as the pianist of the Beaux Arts Trio, 
but he does like getting out on his own once in a while. Sunday afternoon at 
Biola University in La Mirada, the spotlight was focused solely on him in a 
recital of music by Handel, Mozart and Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't lack entirely for company, however. Pressler chose Mozart's Piano 
Concerto No. 14, K. 449, as the centerpiece of his program, and four local 
string players were recruited to provide accompaniment. They are best left 
unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart himself authorized this quintet version of his concerto: the parts for 
oboes and horns are optional, allowing for scaled-down performances. The string 
players on this occasion were sadly inadequate. Poor intonation and meager tone 
were their outstanding qualities. 
</P>
<P>
They were a mismatch for Pressler. His was a reading of warm expression and 
lush tone. Melody lines were lyrically delivered with legato touch and flexible 
tempos. Bass lines were ringing and forthright. Given Pressler's rich 
sonorities, a full orchestra wouldn't have been a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded the concert in an uneven performance of the 24 Preludes, Opus 28, 
by Chopin. In the slower moving Preludes, Pressler could be casually elegant, 
tossing off a beautiful melody with colorful, rhetorical flourishes. At quicker 
tempos, however, this casualness turned to haste. The swirling arpeggios became 
a slapdash blur, and clarity of lines, of shapes, were lost in the rush. 
</P>
<P>
Pressler opened with the Chaconne (with 20 variations) in G by Handel -- an 
oddity on the piano these days, but nevertheless wonderful to hear in 
Pressler's anachronistically lavish account. TIMOTHY MANGAN

HOLLYWOOD TAKES 'SHOT' AT LAUGHING AT ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After his Actors' Studio audition, Shelley Winters told an out-of-work actor to 
"consider an alternative career." No way. He can scratch and writhe and mumble 
pseudo-Mamet dialogue with the best of them. We just saw him do it. His scene 
partner and roommate, Patrick, may be a couple of jumps ahead of the 
auditioning Dern, but that doesn't say much. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of playwright Dan Bell's "The Shot," they're clowns, and he puts 
into their hopeless minds and hapless mouths a delicious blend of Hollywood 
actors' dream balloons and cliches. Their intellectual pratfalls are almost 
Chaplinesque, simultaneously funny and sad. Knock on any door in Hollywood -- 
there are Patrick and Dern, kicking debris out of their way as they slouch 
across the room and fully expecting, in Patrick's case, a three-year contract 
with a top agency and, in Dern's, co-starring status with Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
What they get is an idea: Why not rip off the only negative of David Mamet's 
new film and hold it for ransom? It's a clever gimmick and it's what gives 
shape to "The Shot," at the Olio. But the core of the piece remains the 
characters of Patrick and Dern, played respectively with on-target satire by 
Gill Gayle and the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
It would be to the play's advantage to spend more time with them. Whether 
they're trying to force down trendy food at a trendy restaurant or ripping 
apart the talents of Bruce Willis at a movie matinee, they're a memorable 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
Less memorable is a subplot about Mamet's stealing his own negative for the 
insurance money. "He just wants to make a profit," says Mamet's attorney, 
Rodney Ricks. Played by Lee Kissman, who also directs stylishly, Ricks' best 
moment is a conversation on his car phone with Bruce Willis, trying to bolster 
the actor's ego after he has been dropped from the film version of "Glengarry 
Glen Ross." Sure, Bruce, Demi thinks you have talent, too. 
</P>
<P>
Around the edges, "The Shot" sounds a little like John Steppling, but only a 
little. Steppling never has his tongue this far in his cheek. Bell's kinky 
humor makes the difference, and it works fine when it's played dead serious. 
When it isn't, it just misses. That's what happens to Rick Dean's private 
detective, who secretly writes screenplays in the Mamet mode and sounds oddly 
like John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Fisher is closer to the mark as a female guard at 20th Century Fox, and 
Julie Summer, as Patrick's wiser actress sister, knows exactly what she's doing 
with deadpan delivery of such lines as, "He's gonna do a female version of 
'American Buffalo' if he ever wants to see this film again." 
</P>
<P>
Morley Bartnof's sound, Erik Hanson's costumes and George Stoll's lighting 
frame the satire well. Hollywood and its denizens are easy to rib. Patrick and 
Dern do more than that. They laugh seriously at themselves, and that's what a 
sense of humor is all about. 
</P>
<P>
At 3709 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30 p.m., 
until Nov. 4. Tickets: $10; (213) 667-9556.

LEADER OF FAILED PANAMA COUP IS BURIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The army major who led the unsuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel A. Noriega was 
buried Monday, and opposition leader Guillermo Endara ended a 19-day hunger 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Several reports have said that an enraged Noriega personally shot Maj. Moises 
Giroldi Vega to death minutes after the coup attempt against the Panamanian 
leader ended a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Giroldi, 38, said that he was shot once in the neck and twice in 
the chest. His mother, Eloisa, cried "They murdered him!" and flung herself on 
the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
The major led an uprising Oct. 3 and captured Noriega, who commands the Panama 
Defense Forces and controls the government, but gave up when loyalists 
counterattacked while U.S. troops looked on from a few hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Forces officials said that eight officers and two sergeants were 
killed. They have not explained the circumstances or responded to reports that 
some were slain after surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medical Bulletin 
</P>
<P>
Endara ended his fast and entered a clinic to "normalize my body's system." 
</P>
<P>
A medical bulletin said that his "conscious process was excellent and his 
conversation coherent," but he was suffering "from progressive debilitation." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader has urged Panamanians to delay paying taxes and utility 
bills and to shun the government-operated lottery and casinos, on which the 
regime has depended for much of its revenue during the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has applied economic sanctions and other pressure against 
Panama to try to topple Noriega since federal grand juries in Florida indicted 
him early last year on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega asserts that all efforts to oust him, including those undertaken by his 
local opponents here, are part of a U.S. plot to renege on the 1977 treaties 
that turned the Panama Canal over to this country in 1979. The continuing U.S. 
roles in the operation and defense of the canal are scheduled to end for good 
Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Endara said he felt his hunger strike was a success. He 
said the opposition did not look with approval on Giroldi's attempted coup 
because it represented "Noriega-ism without Noriega," not a movement toward 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Leon Tejada, another rebel, was buried at the same small red stone church 
over the weekend. "He had one bullet wound in the right temple," said Tejada's 
mother, Esther, who was at the church again for Giroldi's burial. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people attended the funeral Mass for Giroldi. 
</P>
<P>
"They were good friends," Esther Tejada said. "My son had just come back from 
(U.N. duty in) Namibia last Saturday. On Tuesday he told his wife he had to go 
to headquarters and would return later to go see his baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not hear anything until Wednesday when they said on television that he 
was dead. We picked up the body." 
</P>
<P>
Giroldi's widow and three children did not attend. They have been under U.S. 
Army protection at Ft. Clayton here since the coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Forces officials say that the rebels surrendered after nearly five 
hours of negotiations with Noriega, who was their hostage at Defense Forces 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helms Blames Noriega 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and several U.S. publications have said Noriega 
personally shot Giroldi in the final moments of the doomed uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Endara, the opposition's presidential candidate in May, took refuge in the 
Vatican's embassy after soldiers beat him and threw him out of his office 
Thursday. Shortly before the assault, Noriega claimed he had evidence that the 
United States planned to install Endara as president. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign observers and the Roman Catholic Church here said that Endara's ticket 
won the May 7 election by a 3-1 margin, but Noriega had the results annulled 
May 10. U.S. officials have said they consider Endara the legitimate president 
of Panama.

SAN FRANCISCO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It came down to 62,084 fans on their feet, three San Francisco Giants on the 
bases, and the Chicago Cubs' premier relief pitcher, Mitch Williams, glaring 
down from the mound. 
</P>
<P>
What separates Will Clark from most is that he saw only the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard nothing, I felt nothing," the Giants' first baseman said. "I didn't 
know what the fans were doing, I didn't know what the pitcher was doing. I 
couldn't have told you what Mitch's eyes looked like. I didn't even know if he 
was wearing a beard. 
</P>
<P>
"What it was, was just me and the ball." 
</P>
<P>
One swing later, as the ball bounced through the thick grass of center field, 
their private meeting became a citywide celebration. Clark's two-run single up 
the middle in the eighth inning Monday helped give the Giants an eventual 3-2 
victory and their first National League pennant since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Their triumph over the Cubs in this National League championship series, four 
games to one, advances them all the way to, well, to the nearest bridge. 
Beginning Saturday in Oakland, they will take on the American League champion 
Athletics in the first World Series-turned-Bay Series. Both teams have been in 
the area since the A's joined the Giants here in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Not that anybody in the Giants' clubhouse Monday would acknowledge that another 
side of the bay exists in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Giants' territory," Giant owner Bob Lurie proclaimed while wearing the 
traditional champagne. "After all, we were here first." 
</P>
<P>
And the memories of their series may last longer, thanks to Monday's finale, 
which featured a fitting end to the best performance by a hitter in the 21-year 
history of the National League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was set up by a collapse of Cub starter Mike Bielecki's arm and 
Cub Manager Don Zimmer's judgment, which accounted for three two-out walks to 
load the bases in a 1-1 tie. Clark, who earlier had tripled and scored the 
Giants' first run, left the on-deck circle feeling good. So good, in fact, that 
he decided to brag about it. 
</P>
<P>
According to on-deck hitter Kevin Mitchell, who spoke to Clark just before he 
stepped to the plate, their conversation went like this: 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell: "You gonna get him?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark: "It's done." 
</P>
<P>
And so it was, although he chose the hard way. Clark took a strike, fouled a 
ball over the backstop, watched a ball, then fouled off two more pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Then came this high, rising fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good pitch, my best pitch," Williams said. "I would not take it back, 
no way." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said, "I just swung. Next thing I know, I'm standing off first base and 
then I hear it. All that screaming and cheering." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't just standing, he was strutting, with his arms raised, and 
black-gloved fists shaking. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, when Chicago's Ryne Sandberg ended a final Cub rally and 
the game by grounding out to second baseman Robby Thompson, Clark strutted 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the Giants' traditional pileup on the mound, he stuck his fists back 
into the air and walked around first base, alone, perhaps befitting for a man 
in a class by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The man did it once, and then once more, and then once again," Cub outfielder 
Marvell Wynne said. "The man is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Wondered Cub Shawon Dunston: "How are you going to stop Mr. Everything?" 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs certainly don't have a clue, since the NL series' most valuable player 
hit .650, collecting three doubles, a triple, two homers and eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
He set championship series records for batting average, slugging percentage, 
1.200; hits, 13; runs, eight; extra-base hits, six, and total bases, 24. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans native also set some sort of mark for high-pitched laughs, such 
as the one he emitted when asked why he thrives on pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah! . . . If guys don't like these situations, they shouldn't be in the game," 
Clark shouted. "If you don't want to come up with the bases loaded, you should 
hang it up. That's what this game is all about. That's what life is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Clark might have noticed that life is also about squirming, which is what the 
Cubs did in that eighth inning, when their hopes for their first World Series 
in 44 years ended. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki started the eighth cruising, having allowed only three hits, including 
Clark's seventh-inning triple that was followed by Mitchell's game-tying 
sacrifice fly. But Bielecki retired the first two Giants in the eighth and 
seemed poised to move the game into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
But then pinch-hitter Candy Maldonado worked Bielecki for 10 pitches, including 
five foul balls, and finally walked. Then, in another full-count battle, Brett 
Butler walked, too. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Bielecki had thrown 127 pitches and was struggling to with his 
curveball. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell he was tired," Mitchell said. "He was putting balls in the dirt 
and everything. I'm surprised they didn't take him out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Butler: "I thought he had lost his composure." 
</P>
<P>
But with Robby Thompson batting, Zimmer trotted out and talked to Bielecki and 
decided he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because he walked a man doesn't mean he was losing something," said 
Zimmer, who made several questionable managerial moves in this series. "I asked 
him how he felt and he said, 'I'm fine,' so I said, 'Let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Four nearly-wild pitches later, Bielecki had walked Thompson to load the bases. 
In came Williams to pitch to Clark . . . and out went the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had enough . . . but I lost it," said a frustrated Bielecki, who 
like many other young Cubs won't soon forget his first postseason experience. 
"One out! I just needed to get one more out. And I couldn't do it. I don't know 
what I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Equal blame for this Cub disaster rests with a man from whom more was expected, 
Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
In his final four at-bats, he stranded nine runners, losing three duels Monday 
with Rick Reuschel, the Giants' starter and winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, with runners on first and third, Dawson struck out. In the sixth, 
with runners on first and third and one out, he flied to right. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in the eighth inning, Dawson burned his name into Cub lore by bouncing 
a ball back to Reuschel with runners on first and second and two out -- after 
Reuschel had walked Mark Grace to pitch to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure it hurts," Dawson said. "I'm supposed to be a leader on the club, but I 
didn't do what I am paid to do." 
</P>
<P>
In one eight-inning stint during which he allowed just one unearned run on 
seven hits, Reuschel may have forever put to rest the belief that this big man 
can't pitch in big games. Before Monday's game, in 20 1/3 postseason innings 
for three teams, Reuschel had allowed 16 earned runs, leading to a 0-3 record 
and a 7.08 ERA.

<P>
A week ago, we all felt great. Now we've got 24 to 30 guys who feel like they 
want to throw up. -- Rick Sutcliffe, Cub 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I didn't give up a hit to Mario Mendoza, you know. I gave up a hit to 
Will Clark. -- Mitch Williams, Cub 
</P>
<P>
 There's not a man among us who blames Andre Dawson or Mitch Williams or myself 
or anybody else for us losing the game. Will Clark won the game. San Francisco 
won the game. We lost the game. The Chicago Cubs. All of us. -- Ryne Sandberg, 
Cub 
</P>
<P>
 I've had ups and I've had downs. This is a major down. -- Andre Dawson, Cub 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think Andre wants anybody to feel sorry for him. -- Mark Grace, Cub 
</P>
<P>
Cub means always having to say you're sorry. 
</P>
<P>
They wear the baby bear on their sleeve; you wear your feelings there. They 
play; you pay. They live, they die; you laugh, you cry. They win; you grin. 
They lose; you bruise. They come from Chicago; you get the wind knocked out of 
you. Either they leave you in stitches or coming apart at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
For 113 years, they have been playing baseball professionally -- well, playing 
professional baseball -- and, to this day, they have never won a postseason 
game west of their city limits. Monday, they concluded a five-game series in 
which they outhit the San Francisco Giants in Games 2, 3, 4 and 5 -- and still 
won only once. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the Chicago Cubs, a team from 
the National League that belongs in the National Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
Their clubhouse was so quiet, you could hear a pennant drop. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it a crummy ending to a wonderful year," said Mark Grace, who may go down 
as the only man in baseball history to bat .647 in a playoff series and still 
be outperformed at his position. The only reason Americans today are not 
talking about the spectacle of Grace under pressure is because of this other 
guy, this Will Clark character, this dangerous man who clubbed the Cubs with 
his stick as cruelly as though they were baby seals. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what would be the most memorable memory of his first National League 
championship series, Grace gave thought for only a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Will Clark," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As your greatest memory? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Grace had to admit, "he kind of made himself tough to forget. You 
know?" 
</P>
<P>
They were the stars of this show, these two first basemen. Together they 
cranked out 24 hits in five games, each man posting staggering slugging 
percentages of 1.100-plus, while fielding flawlessly. Herb Caen, a San 
Francisco columnist of note, summed things up perfectly for posterity, writing: 
"Will played with grace, and Grace played with will." 
</P>
<P>
It finally got to the point where the Giants did everything in their power to 
avoid pitching to Grace, walking him deliberately and daring Andre Dawson to do 
something about it, while the Cubs made the monumental mistake of walking so 
many Giants unintentionally that they had to pitch to Clark, who did do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams was assigned -- forced -- to pitch to Clark. NBC, for its final 
baseball telecast of a golden era, was rewarded with a stare-down between 
Chicago's finest relief pitcher and San Francisco's finest hitter with the 
score 1-1, the bases loaded and two out. How much more color could any peacock 
ask for? 
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, at this very hour on another West Coast television channel, 
Williams' wife was talking to Joan Rivers on a previously taped talk show about 
the hardships and heartbreaks of being married to a ballplayer, of how when her 
husband was traded from Texas to Chicago, she "cried for two weeks." Little did 
Dee Williams know that when it comes to Cubs, you usually end up crying twice, 
coming and going. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams never was so sorry not to have to face Mario Mendoza in his 
life. He got two strikes on Clark but couldn't find a third. Clark's single 
through the box scored two runs, knocked Williams from the box after only one 
batter and left two lefties acquired from Texas, Williams and Steve Wilson, the 
pitching staff's guilty parties of Chicago's final two games. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, don't feel sorry for them. 
</P>
<P>
Feel sorry for Andre. 
</P>
<P>
Don't take Grace's advice. Go right ahead, feel sorry for Andre Dawson. Feel 
sorry for this stand-up guy whose knees ache so badly that he can barely stand 
up. Feel sorry for this 35-year-old Ernie Banks-to-be who has never been to a 
World Series without a ticket. Feel sorry for this handsome, heroic figure who 
once put his signature on a blank contract and left the salary line blank, he 
wanted to play for the Cubs so badly. Feel sorry for him because he played so 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Dawson was gonna burn 'em," Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Dawson stranded 19 baserunners in five games. He hit .105. He struck 
out with the bases loaded for the final out of Game 4. He tapped out to the 
pitcher with two runners on base in the eighth inning of Game 5. He misplayed 
Clark's drive in right field that led to the Giants' game-tying run. Only a Cub 
could be the league's most valuable player (in 1987) when the club finishes in 
last place, then become their least valuable player after the club finishes in 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson folded his arms, took a deep breath, took on all comers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not eating me up inside. It's not tearing me up inside," he said at his 
locker, assessing the damage. "But of course, it hurts. Of course, it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't there when they needed me. I didn't do what I get paid to do. I was 
over-aggressive. A lot of things go through your mind, but all I can do is 
accept it. Maybe this will be the last chance I'll ever have. I'm trying to 
stay on an even keel because, well, what else can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
You live with the Cubs, laugh with the Cubs, love the Cubs, loathe the Cubs, 
laugh at the Cubs. Whatever. You wait for next year. You wait for the year 
after that. You wait and you wait and you wait. What else can you do?

RYPIEN RIGHTS REDSKINS' COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
TWO 4TH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWN PASSES LIFT WASHINGTON 
</P>

<P>
Late in the third quarter Sunday, the Redskins suddenly were a well-foiled 
football machine -- and the formerly faithful at RFK Stadium had had enough. 
The idea of losing to certain NFL birds, the Eagles for instance, is tolerable, 
but not the flock doing all that damage. 
</P>
<P>
The booing began as an irritated ripple, when Mark Rypien's third-down pass was 
batted down, then increased in intensity when Ralf Mojsiejenko's punt wobbled a 
pathetic 29 yards and the Cardinals scored almost immediately, on a 44-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Having limped into this battle, the Cardinals somehow were getting better as 
one after another fine player got sidelined with an injury. Their passing 
actually improved after Roy Green broke his clavicle. 
</P>
<P>
"It still wasn't like we were playing the Little Sisters of the Blind," Rypien 
insisted. And as it developed, all he needed to improve on at game's end was 
his cliches. 
</P>
<P>
When matters became 21-13 ugly, when the crowd started to feel the wooziness of 
a sixth straight home loss coming on, the Redskins just about drew a line near 
midfield and declared: "No more." 
</P>
<P>
It was appropriate that Rypien was mainly responsible for the Redskins' 
comeback victory, with his arm and also his legs, because he'd helped set up 
that predicament a couple of quarters earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Strange team, these Redskins. They know football is a game of inches; they also 
are more likely to gain 900 inches at a time than 36. On third and short, they 
still come up short too often. 
</P>
<P>
First and goal at the Phoenix 4 on the Redskins' first possession became a 
chip-shot field goal by Chip Lohmiller. Next time down the field, Rypien passed 
for a two-yard touchdown. But serious trouble, a probable halftime lead 
crumbling into a one-point deficit, started when Rypien once more couldn't hit 
Donnie Warren from about spitting distance. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last week, Rypien did not overthrow Warren. He was low this time, 
hitting a bloated fencepost named Jim Wahler who had gotten near Warren's path 
on first and 10 at the Cardinals 19. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead by 13-7 a moment before Rypien let loose of a ball better tucked to his 
chest, the Redskins soon were down 14-13 after J.T. Smith made the second and 
third of at least a half-dozen spectacular Cardinals catches. 
</P>
<P>
That may be why Rypien relied on his legs on another critical play, one that 
went the Redskins' way early in the fourth quarter. He was scrambling again, 
though lots of uncluttered field loomed this time. 
</P>
<P>
There was a choice as Rypien came close to the line of scrimmage: flip the ball 
about 32 inches to wide-open Earnest Byner or keep it. Byner was the more 
reliable runner, but Rypien had learned his lesson about passes seemingly 
impossible to miss. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered Byner to block, which he did, flipping linebacker Ken Harvey 
feathers over beak so Rypien could scamper 15 yards to the Phoenix 15. This 
also ended with less than what the Redskins wanted, a field goal instead of a 
touchdown, but Rypien had reestablished a positive presence. 
</P>
<P>
Still in only his 11th start as a pro, he wanted to act as unfazed during this 
rally as the grizzled guys around him in the huddle. Which he did. Down the 
stretch, it was a Zippin' Rypien that riddled the Cards. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of touchdown passes gave the Redskins' defense a lead it couldn't quite 
squander in the final seconds; a 39-yard pass to Art Monk that ended short of 
the end zone might have been Rypien's finest effort. 
</P>
<P>
For ever so long, Rypien has missed on long passes down the right sideline. A 
buddy has been open; the pass has been achingly close at times, though still 
off target. 
</P>
<P>
Monk had run a bit deeper into NFL history earlier, catching the 600th pass of 
his career. This time, gliding along the right sideline, he had a step on 
cornerback Cedric Mack. And Rypien was in his Johnny Unitas mode. 
</P>
<P>
That hummer could not have been thrown better. From close to where Monk finally 
came to earth, Rypien switched programs, this time becoming Mark The Quick. 
</P>
<P>
Near the right sideline from the Cardinals 12, Rypien seemed about to be 
grabbed by 259-pound David Galloway. What Galloway clutched was an armful of 
air, Rypien sidestepping him and firing complete in the end zone to Monk. 
</P>
<P>
As he should have, Rypien praised his blockers and runners and catchers and 
added, honestly: "They (the Cardinals) made a couple more mistakes than we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
If points were given for pluck, the Cardinals would have earned a bundle. With 
a remade offensive line, they still surrendered just one official sack (Charles 
Mann had Gary Hogeboom on the final play, but not before he lateraled the 
ball); Smith's acrobatics will linger in cornerback Brian Davis's mind nearly 
as long as the Giants' Odessa Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming in," Rypien said, "We wanted to protect our own backyard." He called 
letting down fans that yesterday included Vice President Dan Quayle "a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The booing, Rypien said, "doesn't bother me at all. That's what fans are for. 
But we're human." Three-and-two human, sporadic, erratic and dramatic, with a 
chance to join the Giants in the first-place NFC East attic by dusk next 
Sunday.

Natalia Zvereva, the world's 14th-ranked female tennis player and second seeded 
for a Virginia Slims tournament that starts today in Moscow, was told by her 
Soviet national team coach that she must decide whether to become financially 
independent or remain a part of the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, Natalia doesn't know what to do," Soviet coach Olga Morozova

Yet I am the one who arranges her air tickets, hotels and a host of other

USC's Pacific 10 Conference football game against California Saturday at 
Berkeley has been rescheduled to begin at 3:30 p.m., USC school officials 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which will be broadcast live on Prime Ticket cable, was originally 
scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. but was changed last week to a 7:30 p.m. start to 
accommodate a possible ESPN telecast, which failed to materialize.

UCLA SAFETY MCGILL STARS IN FIRST START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ball seemed to hang in the night air like a balloon. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it and said, 'That's me,' " Mark McGill said of the second-quarter pass 
by Arizona State quarterback Paul Justin after it had caromed skyward off 
flanker Lynn James. "I said, 'I'm going to get it.' And I went and got it." 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA safety clutched it and took off down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position coach (Larry Coyer) always talks about catching the ball, tucking 
it away and running like Billy Sims," McGill said. "That's all I was thinking. 
I was trying to score. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, that quarterback -- I don't know how he got my feet. I tried to 
hurdle him, and the next thing I knew, Eric (Turner, a teammate) was on top of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Justin had thrown himself at McGill, tripping him up eight yards short of the 
goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the elated McGill, a fifth-year senior making the first start of his 
UCLA career, had made a major contribution, setting up the touchdown that gave 
the Bruins a 14-0 lead to send them on their way to a 33-14 win Saturday night 
at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I just had to wait for the opportunity to come," said McGill, who has 
played only sparingly at UCLA but started against ASU in relief of injured 
sophomore Matt Darby, sidelined because of a pinched nerve in his neck. "The 
door opened, so I had to go in there and show them what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
McGill, who made nine tackles, is testament to a belief among many that UCLA 
has recruited as well in recent years as any team in college football and that 
Bill Rees, the Bruins' recruiting coordinator, is among the best in the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
A high school All-American five years ago as a quarterback at South High School 
in Bakersfield, McGill was used infrequently in his first three seasons at 
UCLA. Even this season, after Anthony Burnett flunked out of school, McGill was 
thought to be no better than UCLA's third-string strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
With Darby out, he was listed No. 2 last week behind Patrick Bates, a highly 
regarded freshman from Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
But when McGill played so well against ASU, it came as no surprise to Coach 
Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect that," Donahue said. "We tell our players: 'You'd better be ready 
because you're a play away from going (in).' When you're called upon, you've 
got to go. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't the star of the game by any stretch of the imagination, but he did a 
nice job." 
</P>
<P>
McGill said it's to his advantage that he is a former quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, I know what the quarterback is looking for," he said. "Exactly 
what he's looking for, as a matter of fact." 
</P>
<P>
McGill was a prolific passer in a pro-style offense in high school, completing 
54% of his attempts as a senior for 1,719 yards and 22 touchdowns and throwing 
for a school-record 3,082 yards in three years as a varsity starter. 
</P>
<P>
Several schools, including Colorado and California, recruited him as a 
quarterback, he said, but McGill had long dreamed of playing at UCLA, which 
recruited him to be a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"I just liked the ol' powder blue and gold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at South High, McGill had six interceptions, but, he said, "I had 
been (primarily) a quarterback and I didn't grasp, or really have a concept of, 
what it meant to be a safety at a Pac-10 school. 
</P>
<P>
"My second year, I started to learn what a safety is supposed to do. It's 
really an impact position. It's the last line of defense, and you can really 
set the tone of a game." 
</P>
<P>
McGill improved, but in the spring before his sophomore year, he broke a foot 
and fell to the bottom of the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
It has been difficult, he said, to spend so much time on the sideline, waiting 
for a call from the coaches that seldom comes. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, McGill participated in only 26 scrimmage plays, almost half of 
them in a 56-3 rout of Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Was it frustrating? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he said. "You sit around and you contemplate not playing. It's 
very frustrating at times because you know you could be out there doing what 
(the regulars) are doing. You just sit back and say, 'Golly, I just want to get 
in there and do something -- put my time in and show them that I can do 
something.' " 
</P>
<P>
That time came last week. 
</P>
<P>
Coyer, the secondary coach who described the 6-foot, 197-pound McGill as a 
"class guy" and "the type of player who hangs in there until he finally gets a 
chance," said it was a thrill to see him start. 
</P>
<P>
McGill, of course, also was thrilled to be starting. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, "Actually, I wasn't that nervous. I was more nervous when I got 
out there than I was before the game. When I got out there, it was like, 'I'm 
really here. I'm really starting.' 
</P>
<P>
"But it felt so good. I hadn't been out there since high school, and I was just 
so hyper." 
</P>
<P>
He'd like nothing better than a chance to relive the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I've shown them I can play, I hope to be worked into the game a lot 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it doesn't happen, though, he can't say he didn't make the most of his 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my last year, and I had faith that I was going to come through 
sometime," he said. "I just didn't know when. I was waiting." 
</P>
<P>
His wait has ended. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting strong safety Matt Darby is listed as questionable for UCLA's game 
against Arizona Saturday at 12:30 p.m., PDT, in Tucson. . . . Linebacker Craig 
Davis made 19 tackles against Arizona State, enjoying the best game of his 
career, Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Wills, who ran for 79 yards in 23 carries against Arizona State, will 
probably start again at tailback ahead of Brian Brown, but Donahue said: "I 
really haven't finalized it or put it in granite." Brown gained 48 yards in 12 
carries last week. . . . Receiver Mike Farr replaced Wills as the Bruins' punt 
returner, Wills said, because Donahue wanted a more sure-handed player 
returning punts. Wills lost a fumbled punt inside the five-yard line two weeks 
ago against California. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive guard Rick Meyer had the flu last week, lost 11 pounds and played 
only sparingly against ASU, giving way to sophomore Scott Spalding. . . . 
Arizona, which is 3-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, did not 
play last week.

NEWSWIRE: ASSISTANT SAYS HE RECEIVED $18,000 FROM HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynn Amedee, offensive coordinator at the University of Texas, said Monday that 
he received $18,000 last year in a personal-services contract from former 
Florida football Coach Galen Hall, who resigned Sunday amid charges he broke 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules. 
</P>
<P>
The charges included making unreported payments to two Florida assistants, one 
of them Amedee. Amedee said his contract was not reported to Florida officials 
and said he was unaware the arrangement might have violated NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
David Berst, the NCAA's executive director of enforcement, said that neither 
Texas nor Amedee would be subject to sanctions.

DRAVECKY INJURES ARM AGAIN DURING POSTGAME CELEBRATION 
</P>

Dave Dravecky, who battled back from cancer only to break his arm pitching, 
injured his arm again in the Giants' postgame celebration Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky, who was in uniform but not on the Giants' playoff roster, may have 
dislocated his left shoulder, assistant trainer Greg Lynn said. He will be 
examined at the Palo Alto Clinic today by team physician Gordon Campbell, who 
helped Dravecky rehabilitate his arm after cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"He was running out to the mound after the final out, prepared to protect 
himself, and somebody ran into him from behind," Lynn said two hours after the 
game in the Giants' nearly deserted clubhouse. "A lot of guys were saying he 
separated it, but that's not what we heard in the training room. We'll know 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky, 33, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 Saturday, the 
first anniversary of the surgery to remove a cancerous tumor located in the 
deltoid muscle near his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
After months of therapy and a minor league rehabilitation stint, he returned to 
the mound at Candlestick Park on Aug. 10 and pitched eight innings to earn an 
emotional 4-3 victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later in Montreal, Dravecky broke the humerus bone in his left upper 
arm while pitching to Tim Raines. He got the victory to finish the season with 
a 2-0 record and a 3.46 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
A further evaluation showed Dravecky had a spiral oblique fracture -- a 
twisting break, not unlike the stripes on a candy cane -- that didn't affect 
the muscle where the tumor was removed. Doctors said they saw no reason why he 
wouldn't be able to return next season.

NFL REMAINS A HOUSE DIVIDED; 
</P>
<P>
OWNERS MAY VOTE AGAIN TONIGHT, BUT THEY STILL SEEM TO BE SPLIT 
</P>

<P>
The owners of the 28 National Football League clubs will make another run at an 
elusive target here today. 
</P>
<P>
Still divided after six months of in-fighting, they will interview four 
candidates for commissioner and try to vote one into office tonight. Or 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Or Thursday. Or someday. 
</P>
<P>
Their new search committee has turned up only one new candidate in the last 
three months -- J. Patrick Barrett, a Syracuse, N.Y., investor, businessman, 
and politician. 
</P>
<P>
As a businessman, Barrett sold the Avis rental car business to his employees 
two years ago. As a politician, he heads the Republican party's state central 
committee in Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Others still in the running for commissioner were all recommended by the NFL's 
original search committee last July. And the front-runner since then, Jim 
Finks, general manager of the New Orleans Saints, still holds the support of 
most old-line clubs. 
</P>
<P>
So the question today is whether the owners are about to polarize into a 
Barrett faction and a Finks faction. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the Barrett group, presumably, would include some or all of the 11 
dissident owners who, after declining to accept Finks at the NFL's July meeting 
in Chicago, have been calling for a commissioner with a business-firm 
background as a chief executive officer.

It was in Chicago that Finks won 16 of the 19 votes necessary for election. He 
would have had 17 votes if owner Bud Adams of the Houston Oilers had been able 
to get his plane off the ground that day in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"From the start, my two candidates were Finks and (housing secretary) Jack 
Kemp," Adams said. "And Kemp took himself out (of the race)." 
</P>
<P>
A stalemated 17-11 convention could lead to the election of a compromise 
commissioner, possibly one of the two other candidates here for interviews, NFL 
lawyer Paul Tagliabue and NFL Hall of Famer Willie Davis, now a Los Angeles 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rozelle, the present commissioner whose wish to retire -- as expressed 
last March -- precipitated the present fight, was a compromise choice 30 years 
ago, when his election ended 10 days of fruitless balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cleveland Browns' owner Art Modell: "I fear we're pretty well stalemated 
again." 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Chicago 11 faction, Norman Braman, who owns the Philadelphia 
Eagles, has been trying to pull the sides together. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we elect someone (this week)," Braman said. "Speaking for myself, I 
won't abstain again, and I'd hope no one will." 
</P>
<P>
Few, however, have made up their minds. They can't even agree on whether it's 
essential to replace Rozelle now or after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"The league needs to start moving ahead (with a new commissioner) as soon as 
possible," said Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and co-chairman of 
both NFL search committees. "There are too many uncertainties in any business 
when the (top man) is in question." 
</P>
<P>
Taking the other side, Pat Bowlen of the Denver Broncos proposes that a 
committee of owners replace Rozelle temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to get the right man," Bowlen said. "That's more 
important than to choose a new commissioner today just to have one." 
</P>
<P>
The feud that has split the league is between factions of multimillionaires who 
have operated NFL teams for various periods of time: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fifteen owners have been in the league 15 years or more, most of them 20 
years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thirteen have bought their NFL franchises in the last 15 years, many in the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The old guard charges that the newer owners don't understand the sport and are 
just out to maximize their investments. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Turks charge that the old guard is without sympathy for them and 
their problems, which are financial for the most part, stemming from large 
franchise investments. They also accuse the old guard of having failed to 
maximize the NFL's marketing potential. 
</P>
<P>
All candidates for commissioner must stand up and be interviewed here. 
</P>
<P>
One prospect has already withdrawn, rather than subject himself to the process. 
He is Robert Mulcahy, head of the Meadowlands complex in New Jersey, who pulled 
out Saturday night when told of the interview format. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think Jack Kemp would audition for us?" one NFL owner asked. "No 
top-level person would." 
</P>
<P>
With Rozelle as a lame-duck commissioner, the owner added that the league has 
become critically weak. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that NFL football has been so spectacular all season," he said. 
"Our product has never been better, and our organization has never been 
weaker."

RAMS WEREN'T HURT ALL THAT MUCH WHEN GREG BELL WAS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The runners are stacked so deep on the Rams' tailback turf that Sunday's 
game-ending injury to Greg Bell, the league's leading rusher at the time, 
almost warmed a coach's heart. Bell's coach! 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say, 'Oh boy, good, you're hurt,' " John Robinson said of Bell's 
slight hamstring pull. "But I thought to myself, 'Geez, I'm going to get to 
play these other guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
Such are the luxuries of 5-0 coaches with bus loads of talent. 
</P>
<P>
After Bell's injury forced him out of the game in the second quarter, Robinson 
simply opened the refrigerator and grabbed two first-round draft picks, 
Cleveland Gary and Gaston Green, and Robert Delpino, a fifth-round choice who 
plays in a much higher league. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Sunday's 26-14 victory over the Atlanta Falcons provided a 
glimpse of the Rams' future, but until it's here, the young backs better get 
used to role-playing. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino gave a stirring demonstration of that. The second-year man from 
Missouri didn't waste a breath on the field, rushing four times for 48 yards. 
He also had a touchdown reception of seven yards, returned a kickoff 22 yards, 
threw the lead block on Ron Brown's 74-yard return and tackled Deion Sanders 
once as part of the kickoff return team. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said: "Bobby Delpino's effort in the game was a big thing for me, in 
terms of 'There's a man who understands the role that he has to play,' and he 
played it with brilliance." 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Green might want to take note. As long as Bell is running well, their 
chances will be few. But you never know when a guy's hamstrings will tighten. 
Gary, the rookie from Miami, got seven carries against the Falcons for 25 
yards; Green carried nine times for 36 yards. Soak it up while you can. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he isn't worried about having to spread the tailback job around 
right now because, well, Bell is swell and the others aren't quite ready to be 
impact players. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have too many good running backs," Robinson said. "I mean, we have 
some guys that are doing a good job, but most of those kids are just starting. 
Cleveland Gary is just a guy, he doesn't know half our offense, so he's just 
getting started. Gaston Green, out of the last eight games, he's missed four to 
injury, or not being ready. It's a nice collection of young backs, but I see 
them very much as learning people." 
</P>
<P>
The years ahead could be very different. Robinson is considering a change in 
offensive formations to accommodate his fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it forces some adjustments on our part in terms of our style of 
offense," he said. "We might want to see ourselves going back to a two-back -- 
not back, I've never been there -- but to a two-back offense, kind of like the 
(San Francisco) 49ers. Remember (Wendell) Tyler and (Roger) Craig? I think both 
had a thousand yards one year, or close. That's just speculation." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, it's take a number, wait your turn, and don't blow it when it 
comes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be nice if everybody got some action," Robinson said. "Is it 
important? Only if it helps us win." 
</P>
<P>
When you're 5-0, everything seems to break your way, even shoulders. Instead of 
facing quarterback Jim Kelly and the Buffalo Bills next Monday night, the Rams 
will get Frank Reich, who until Sunday's mop-up work hadn't thrown a 
regular-season pass since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, the AFC's top-rated passer, separated his left shoulder in the Bills' 
loss to Indianapolis. Reich put up some good numbers in relief, completing 11 
of 19 passes for 177 yards. Reich has thrown 39 passes in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The league's only unbeaten team is trying to keep its emotions under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're influenced much by the euphoria of what others may say 
about 5-0," Robinson said. "Within our own walls of our team, we're excited as 
hell about our team for our reasons. I think guys are excited that Bobby 
Delpino made that catch, and Ron Brown ran back a kickoff. Those things are 
becoming very exciting to us, but I don't think we are very interested right 
now in other people. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're interested in, 'How good are the (New York) Giants? The 
(Chicago) Bears?' We got a lot of guys who've never been to Chicago, and a 
whole bunch who've never been to Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Fred Strickland took another hit on his right knee Sunday, but a 
magnetic reasonance imaging test Monday proved negative. Strickland had 
arthroscopic surgery on the knee in August but the Rams are calling this injury 
"an irritation to the joint lining." They've listed Strickland as questionable 
for Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell's tight hamstring cost him the chance of returning to Buffalo as the 
National Football League's leading rusher. Bell started Sunday's game six yards 
ahead of Chicago's Neal Anderson but left the Atlanta game in the second 
quarter after gaining 62 yards in 10 carries. Anderson gained 86 yards against 
Tampa Bay and leads the league with 530, 28 more yards than Bell. Bell spent 
more than three seasons in Buffalo before being dealt to the Rams in 1987 as 
part of the Eric Dickerson deal. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the Rams rank third against the run and 27th against the pass. "It 
is the most deceiving statistic in football," John Robinson said of his team's 
pass defense numbers. "And the least important statistic. It does not equate to 
winning much."

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: TESTS DIDN'T LET COPELAND KNOW DANGER HE FACED

This football season in the Southland will be remembered for the deaths of 
three outstanding players. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, Raider safety Stacey Toran, 27, was killed in an automobile 
accident; last month, University of Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, 21, from 
the San Diego Area, died of stomach cancer, and Friday night, Kevin Copeland, 
17, of Dorsey High School died apparently of heart failure during a game 
against San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland's family has a history of heart problems. In 1975, his father, Ron 
Copeland Sr., who played football at UCLA and with the Chicago Bears, died of a 
heart attack at 28 after running a sprint race. Kevin's grandfather, Harold 
Copeland, died of heart disease a week before the death of Ron Sr. 
</P>
<P>
In light of these facts, the question immediately arose: Should Kevin Copeland 
have been playing football? 
</P>
<P>
Millicent Copeland said that she knew her son could be taking a risk by playing 
football. She had even taken him to doctors before he became involved in the 
sport, but nothing was discovered that would indicate he should not play. 
</P>
<P>
The mother hoped that any heart problems had passed over Kevin and his 
brothers, Ron Jr. and Kyle. But Friday night, Kevin Copeland collapsed on the 
sideline at Daniels Field in San Pedro shortly before the end of the first 
quarter. He was pronounced dead at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital at 9:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who came in contact with Kevin Copeland knew that he was special. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to go through life as if he had a secret, because everything came so 
easy for him. He was an outstanding student and athlete who always greeted 
people warmly and had an aura about him that made it seem he was destined for 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland played football because he loved the game. He also had the required 
talent, and that combination made the sport fun to play. For him, there was 
football and then the other sports. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, he competed on the track, where he also excelled. As a junior, 
he was a state meet qualifier in the 100 and 200 meters and a member of 
Dorsey's state champion 400-meter relay team. However, he was quick to point 
out that he was just running to stay in shape for his real sport, football. 
</P>
<P>
Everything he did on the football field appeared smooth and effortless, whether 
he was catching a pass, receiving a kick, avoiding tacklers or intercepting a 
pass. As a scoring threat, he was to Dorsey what Tim Brown was to Notre Dame 
during his Heisman Trophy season. 
</P>
<P>
After being selected to the All-City team last year from a senior-led Dorsey 
team, Copeland figured that this would be his season. Gone from the Dons' 
roster were Beno Bryant, Shawn Miller, Roman Foster and Sharrief Shah. It was 
up to Copeland to provide Dorsey with leadership in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He had begun to assume that role last season, when he became one of the top 
prep receivers in the nation, catching 33 passes for more than 700 yards and 11 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Although seemingly quiet and mild-mannered, Copeland displayed an aggressive 
competitive spirit on the football field, as if every play might be his last. 
He never wanted an opponent to feel that they had an edge over him because he 
did not give his best. 
</P>
<P>
His obvious talents made him a top college prospect and he was being heavily 
recruited by USC, UCLA, Notre Dame, Michigan and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Showboating was not his style; he thought of himself merely as a hard worker 
who usually accomplished what he set out to do. After making an outstanding 
play, he would let those around him celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the aftermath of his death, Kevin Copeland has again left any emotion 
up to others. And for those who knew him, it will be hard to conceal. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be held Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. at the Maranatha 
Community Church, 3800 West Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Donations may be sent 
in the name of Millicent Copeland to Dorsey High School, 3537 Farmdale Ave, Los 
Angeles 90016. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Whittier High upset top-ranked Loyola, 21-14, to win the 
Southern Section 4-A Division football title for the first and only time. With 
the victory, the Cardinals ended the Cubs' 35-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, that championship team was honored during Whittier's 21-17 
win over town-rival California before an estimated crowd of 3,000 at California 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Among the returning Cardinals were tight end George Buehler, who became a 
standout at Stanford and with the Raiders, and Bob Chandler, a star wide 
receiver at USC and with the Buffalo Bills and the Raiders. That season, 
Buehler, who now lives in the Bay Area, was Southern Section player of the 
year; Chandler, master of ceremonies for the reunion, was a reserve 
underclassman on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important Cardinal to return was Gary Styler, now an 
electrician. He came to the rescue Friday night when the game was delayed 30 
minutes because of a power failure at the stadium, getting the lights back on 
so the game could begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CASEY SIEMASZKO IN 'BREAKING IN': NO TIME TO PLAY IT SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When director Bill Forsyth was casting "Breaking In," which opens Friday, he 
was having a tough time picking out an eccentric, likable actor to play Burt 
Reynold's safe-cracking protege in the film. Forsyth had spent so much time 
staring at 8-by-10 photographs of hopeful young actors that their faces were 
turning into one glossy blur. 
</P>
<P>
"They all started to look the same," the Scottish director said. 
</P>
<P>
So he and his casting director drove to the 18-screen Universal City Cinemas, 
bought a pair of tickets and began theater-hopping -- spending five minutes in 
one theater, five minutes in the next -- hoping to find a bright new face to 
star in their film. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite an efficient way to work," Forsyth said. "We sat down and watched a 
few minutes of 'Biloxi Blues,' and one of the soldiers in the barracks was kind 
of waving at me from the background." 
</P>
<P>
The soldier was Casey Siemaszko, a 28-year-old actor with a resume of hefty 
supporting roles -- as a '50s high schooler in "Back to the Future," a teen-age 
gangster in "Stand By Me," a heroic soldier in "Gardens of Stone" and the cocky 
pugilist in "Young Guns." He even had his own starring role, as a nerdy 
underdog in a showdown with a brutish bully in the stylish comedy "Three 
O'Clock High." 
</P>
<P>
Impressed, Forsyth set up an appointment with Siemaszko at the Chateau Marmont, 
where they met for the first time in the hotel's garden. After spending a few 
minutes talking over the script, Forsyth excused himself to take a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came back, Casey had climbed up this wall and was halfway up a tree, 
looking out over traffic," Forsyth said, incredulously. "I never figured out if 
this was just a thing he did, or if he was showing me that he could climb walls 
because he knew the character had to do things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Siemaszko is not sure why he climbed the tree, or if he really did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous, you know," Siemaszko said recently during an interview 
in the garden of the Sunset Marquis, just down the Sunset Strip from the 
Chateau Marmont. "After reading the script, I knew that I wanted the part. Bill 
(Forsyth) left me alone in that garden, and I was like . . . 'This is taking 
too long. I got to do something.' " He paused absently. "Apparently, I climbed 
a tree. I don't even remember. I mean, I think I did." 
</P>
<P>
In "Breaking In," Reynolds plays an aging pro who cracks safes for a living. 
Siemaszko breaks into houses only to read the mail, raid the refrigerator and 
maybe watch some TV. When the two go bump in the night on the same job, 
Reynolds cuts Siemaszko in on half his take, explaining, "I would rather have a 
partner than a witness." 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this role will demonstrate that I'm capable of drawing out of 
myself to create totally different characters," Siemaszko said. "That's what my 
idea of acting is all about. It's the ability to draw out of that little file 
inside of you, beef up certain aspects of yourself that aren't there, and tone 
down certain aspects that come on too strong." 
</P>
<P>
Siemaszko has a working man's sensibility about acting: "Work hard, persevere 
and everything will fall into place." He says that simple work ethic is rooted 
in his Polish upbringing in the Northwest side of Chicago, where as a kid he 
would ride his bike to nearby Wrigley Field, shinny up a drain pipe and watch 
the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a product of the Polish artistic community," said Siemaszko, who speaks 
Polish fluently. "There are a number of professional artists who have been 
displaced from Poland for various political and economic reasons. The natural 
place for them to get rolling was in the Polish community because their 
language and culture was understood there. I grew up surrounded by some of 
Poland's top artists." 
</P>
<P>
Siemaszko, who refined his skills with a college acting degree, made his 
performance debut when he was 5 on stage with The Kosciuszko Dancers, a 
folk-dancing group headed by his father, an instructor in Polish dance and 
culture. Growing up, Siemaszko acted in the Ref-Ren Theatre, a Polish community 
theater, and for a while sang with three girls in a quartet. "That was before 
my voice changed," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"But my first professional job was with the Illinois State Lottery. I promoted 
them on the fair circuit out on the corn and bean fields of Illinois. I 
juggled, played guitar, made balloon animals and said" -- he barked out -- " 
'Lottery! Gotta' get ya' lottery tickets!' I kind of liked saying that." 
</P>
<P>
Siemaszko, who reprises his role as one of Michael J. Fox's buddies in the 
sequel to "Back to the Future," hopes one day to land a role that will allow 
him to use up his whole bag of performing-arts tricks, which includes singing, 
dancing, clowning, juggling, riding a unicycle and playing several musical 
instruments. "I'm a jack of all trades and master of none," he said. "But give 
me enough time and I can get any of them to performance level. I'd love to do 
Jimmy Cagney because he was able to show everything, from romance to street 
smarts." 
</P>
<P>
With "Breaking In," Siemaszko added a new skill to his cache: the art of 
busting safes. One of the film's technical advisers was a gentlemanly ex-safe 
cracker who instructed Reynolds and Siemaszko in the peculiarities of his 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"What is acting to me?" Siemaszko said, echoing the question put to him. 
"Therapy! Therapy!" He laughed and quieted down. 
</P>
<P>
"It satisfies my curiosities. When I'm on the set I'm always asking questions. 
I don't ever want to lose the part of me that is curious, the part of me that 
is a little boy."

EUROPE TV QUOTA DOESN'T RATTLE HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood video and film salesmen who are leaving for the French Riviera this 
week to sell their wares at an annual international TV programming bazaar seem 
to be of two minds on Europe's recent adoption of a non-binding quota on the 
amount of foreign productions that may be shown on European television. Either 
they're diplomatically dubious . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure at this point in time that it's going to have an immediate effect 
on producers or programs that are being produced here in the U.S.," said Phil 
Corvo, executive director of the National Assn. of Television Programming 
Executives International. 
</P>
<P>
. . . or they are openly scoffing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible," said Colin Davis, president of MCA TV International. "They 
simply cannot fill their airwaves without us." 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's a form of censorship and it's not going to work," said Joe 
Levinsohn, senior vice president for international sales for Republic Films. 
"People in Europe want American programs. They're going to write letters 
protesting it and the whole thing is going to backfire." 
</P>
<P>
The non-binding quota, approved on a 10-2 vote of the European Community in 
Luxembourg last week, restricts foreign programming on TV stations in each 
member country to no more than half of its total entertainment programming. 
Since the 12-nation economic and cultural alliance first discussed the 
possibility nearly two years ago, the underlying idea of quotas has been to 
encourage production in its own countries. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality of the rush to the Marche International de Filmes et des 
Programmes Pour La TV, La Video, Le Cable et Le Satellite, which opens Thursday 
in Cannes, seems to fly in the face of the European Community's proclamation. 
The annual fall flea market of old television series, specials and movies has 
more than doubled in size since it began five years ago, said spokeswoman 
Rebecca Segal. 
</P>
<P>
As of the weekend, the gathering had 1,143 pre-registered buyers, and officials 
expected even more to show up, currency in hand, when the five-day sales 
conference officially opens. More than 600 companies will be selling thousands 
of hours of TV shows and motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are as simple as satellites, the explosion of commercial television 
in Western Europe and 320 million potential European couch potatoes. As 
recently as August, Spain joined France, Britain and Italy in granting licenses 
to three new privately owned and operated television operations that will 
compete for a share of the Spanish audience. Private TV operations that put 
their signals up on satellite or link themselves to millions of French, Italian 
and British homes through cable are scrambling for something to put on the air 
between commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"Quotas don't work," Davis said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
"What're they going to do? Put on some el cheapo game show? That was the 
Canadian solution." 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Canada imposed content regulations on TV programming in an 
effort to discourage a flood of American shows across the border. But Canadian 
audiences proved too insatiable for the meager output that Canadian television 
producers were capable of generating, said Davis, and the result was an 
inevitable slide back to American sitcoms and dramas. 
</P>
<P>
"Canada has content regulation and what do they have in prime time? American 
programs, that's what they have," Levinsohn declared. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Marche International de Filmes et des Programmes Pour La TV, La 
Video, Le Cable et Le Satellite's first sales conference in 1984, each of the 
major countries in the European Community has loosened restrictions on 
privately operated TV operations. As a result, audiences -- first in Britain 
and soon, thereafter, in France and Italy -- now have several commercial 
stations to choose from in addition to the traditional state-run operations 
such as the venerable British Broadcasting Corp. The number of channels in 
Western Europe is expected to double over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to video salesmen such as Republic's Levinsohn and MCA's Davis, 
Europe's new hard line on the import of American programming is too little too 
late -- a feeble finger in the dike that cannot hold back an ocean of 40 years' 
worth of American sitcoms, cop shows and family drama whether its quality by 
current U.S. prime-time standards is good, bad or dismal. 
</P>
<P>
Take "Captain Nice," for example. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen it, but I sold 15 episodes to France and Italy," Republic's 
Levinsohn said. "Don't ask me what its about." 
</P>
<P>
The short-lived 1967 sitcom, created by Buck Henry, was a parody of superhero 
shows that were in vogue 20 years ago as a partial result of the success of the 
"Batman" TV series. It is one of several dozen old NBC shows that Republic 
inherited from the network in a Republic purchase from the NBC library, said 
Levinsohn. 
</P>
<P>
"I have it and I sold it!" Levinsohn said. "It's not 'Beauty and the Beast,' 
but it's American programming. It's 'Captain Nice' and it's going off in prime 
time in France and Italy." 
</P>
<P>
"Beauty and the Beast," the CBS romantic series, is one of the newer offerings 
Republic is hawking in Europe. It's even more in demand, all around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sold it in 95 countries so far," said Levinsohn. "The bottom line is that 
American programming is in demand worldwide. They're paying a lot of money for 
it and I'm not the only one selling it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Davis' small army of salesmen at MCA TV International may not be 
selling everything from A to Z, but they have more than 150 half-hour, hour and 
90-minute series running the gamut from A ("Adam-12," "Amen," "Airwolf") to W 
("Whiz Kids," "Wagon Train" "When the Whistle Blows"). 
</P>
<P>
With its recent acquisition of Lorimar and its legendary "Dallas" package so 
reverently embraced by European audiences, Warner Bros. Television Distribution 
would appear to be the biggest player in the high-stakes European TV 
syndication game. But at the moment, any company with any kind of a library of 
American films or video is running a candy store, and Western Europe is jammed 
with hungry kids. 
</P>
<P>
Though they don't feel threatened, several American companies are forming 
co-production operations with European producers just in case the 50% quota 
does go into effect in two years as the new European Community law dictates. 
</P>
<P>
King World TV, producers of "Wheel of Fortune," currently franchises the game 
show to co-producers in France, Scotland and other countries under an agreement 
that allows a European version of the program to be produced and aired in each 
licensed nation, thereby circumventing the quota. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Entertainment has a similar co-production plan with Fremantle 
International/Talbot Television, a British company. Under the Blair/Fremantle 
plan, the syndicated U.S. show "Divorce Court" is re-produced in Europe, using 
American scripts that have been tailored both to the language of the country 
and to local divorce laws. Spain, France, West Germany and Italy have already 
signed production agreements and Blair hopes to sell its proposal to the rest 
of Europe next week.

CANCER DISCOVERY EARNS NOBEL PRIZE FOR 2 AT UC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two UC San Francisco scientists who unearthed "the seeds of cancer" buried deep 
in the genetic makeup of both humans and animals won the Nobel Prize in 
medicine Monday. Their discovery is widely credited with sparking a revolution 
in cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
Drs. J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus received the award for their 
finding in the mid-1970s that certain genes that guide normal growth can be 
converted into cancer-causing genes -- called oncogenes -- that transform 
healthy cells into tumor cells. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I read the thesis, I thought I had misunderstood it," said 
Prof. Gosta Garthon of Sweden's Nobel awarding committee. "Imagine: The likely 
cause of cancer comes from us, and all that the outside factors have to do is 
to push the right button." 
</P>
<P>
Cancer researchers hailed the committee's choice as a powerful acknowledgement 
of the importance of research into oncogenes, about 40 of which have now been 
identified and linked to 20 forms of cancer, including cancers of the lung and 
breast. 
</P>
<P>
"The discovery of oncogenes was a great, seminal discovery that has determined 
the course of cancer research ever since," said Peter Vogt, a prominent USC 
microbiologist who collaborated with Bishop and Varmus. "I think cancer 
research has been completely transformed by this discovery." 
</P>
<P>
However, the announcement was marred Monday when a French researcher who worked 
with Bishop and Varmus complained bitterly that he should have shared in the 
award and that the Nobel committee ignored his contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dominique Stehelin, now at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, told Agence 
France-Presse, "I did all the work by myself, from A to Z." He called his 
exclusion from the award "very unfair and rotten." 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in San Francisco, Bishop described Stehelin as a 
post-doctoral fellow at the time "who carried out the bulk of the experiments." 
Varmus and others said the complex evolution of oncogene research has made it 
difficult to determine how to allocate credit for pioneering work. 
</P>
<P>
"All work that goes on in science was not done in a vacuum," said Dr. Stuart 
Aaronson, chief of the laboratory of cellular and molecular biology at the 
federal National Cancer Institute. "Their work built on critically important 
work done by many." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, 53, and Varmus, 49, both professors of microbiology at UCSF, arrived at 
their discovery through research into so-called retroviruses, a group of 
viruses suspected of being the most prevalent viral cause of tumors. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, the researchers found that a particular virus gene 
responsible for transforming a normal cell into a cancerous cell was actually 
derived from a normal gene present in chromosomes of all animals, including 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
That gene and others like it, called proto-oncogenes, can be converted into 
oncogenes by outside influences such as viral infections or exposure to 
carcinogens, including chemicals and radiation. Once converted, they then 
transform normal cells into cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea (had) been around for a long time that . . . cancer cells happen 
because something goes wrong with the genetic machinery that runs our cells," 
Bishop said Monday. "The idea is that something happens to those genes. They 
get damaged and cause cells to run amok. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of 'Genetic Dowry' 
</P>
<P>
"Our work gave substance to the idea that our cells contain genes that if 
damaged can give rise to cancerous growth," he added. "So, if you will, we have 
the seeds of cancer in our own genetic dowry." 
</P>
<P>
That discovery, published in 1976, opened up two areas for further research. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists began searching for other oncogenes capable of setting in motion 
other forms of cancer and they began examining the role of their precursors, or 
proto-oncogenes, in normal growth and development. 
</P>
<P>
"These genes control normal rates of growth and development of tissues and body 
parts," said Dr. Laurence Kedes, chairman of the department of biochemistry at 
USC School of Medicine. "That's the brilliant insight -- that these cancer 
genes are closely linked to normal cellular division and development." 
</P>
<P>
A gene is the basic unit of heredity. It is contained within the nucleus of a 
cell and influences its workings. Every human cell holds more than 50,000 genes 
which, all together, direct the development and functioning of all organs and 
systems in the body. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the oncogene findings may eventually produce new approaches to 
diagnosing and treating some cancers. The discovery that different cancers are 
caused by different, and very specific, genes suggests the need for a wide 
range of approaches, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question for the Future 
</P>
<P>
"Can we, by knowing what turns on oncogenes, figure out how to turn them off?" 
wondered Dr. John Laszlo, senior vice president for research at the American 
Cancer Society, who said researchers are exploring ways of "putting the brakes 
back on the oncogenes." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo also suggested that understanding which oncogenes trigger which cancers 
might make it possible to screen people for particular susceptibilities, thus 
enabling public health authorities to better target education and prevention 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
It may also be possible to develop products that would counteract the effects 
of oncogenes on normal cells. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize is awarded by the 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska 
Institute in Sweden. Bishop and Varmus were chosen for the 1989 prize in 
medicine from about 250 scientists whose names were submitted by nominating 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon for Nobel Prizes to be awarded for work done many years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop and Varmus received word of the prize, which carries a $460,000 award, 
before dawn Monday. Varmus was awakened by a call from a radio reporter looking 
for a comment; Bishop, whose son woke him, described the experience as 
"surreal." 
</P>
<P>
They celebrated with a champagne press conference at UCSF at 8:30 a.m. -- early 
enough to get out in time to watch the San Francisco Giants play the Chicago 
Cubs at Candlestick Park in game five of the National League Championship 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they had received advice on what to do with the money, Varmus 
said his wife had suggested a built-in dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
Born in York, Pa., Bishop is a graduate of Gettysburg College and Harvard 
Medical School. After two years of post-doctoral training at the federal 
National Institutes of Health, he joined the UCSF faculty in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Varmus was born in Oceanside, N.Y., and holds a bachelor's degree from Amherst 
College, a master's from Harvard and a medical degree from Columbia University. 
He, too, worked briefly at the NIH and went to work at UCSF in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Both men are married with two sons.

SOVIETS OK RIGHT TO STRIKE BUT EXCLUDE KEY INDUSTRIES

<P>
For the first time since the earliest years of the Soviet state, the majority 
of Soviet workers won the right to strike under legislation enacted Monday. But 
the same law prohibits work stoppages in key industries. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, the newly strengthened legislature, emphasized in a day of 
heated debate that the basic thrust of the new law is to make clear the 
workers' right to strike except where such action would endanger lives, health 
or the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet lawmakers, in their first major legislation, outlined the steps -- 
conciliation, mediation and arbitration -- that workers must follow before they 
can legally strike. And they made the courts, not the government's executive 
branch, the referee if disputes arise over the right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
The declared goal of the legislation, adopted by a vote of 373 to 12, with 10 
abstentions, is ensuring workers' collective bargaining power as the Soviet 
economy, now largely state-owned and centrally planned, begins to diversify and 
to respond to market forces. 
</P>
<P>
In immediate practice, however, the law recognizes the power that Soviet 
workers won for themselves in a series of major strikes over the summer -- 
strikes that paralyzed most of the coal-mining industry for nearly a month and 
threatened steel mills and railways -- and everything that depends on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Strikes are now a reality," one prominent deputy, A. N. Kraiko, an aircraft 
engineer and designer, argued. "We viewed this reality for a long time as 
destructive, but world experience proves that strikes can have a constructive 
role (in) regulating the relationship between workers and their employers." 
</P>
<P>
Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet physicist and human rights activist who won the 
Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, said a strike has often been the only way for 
inmates of the country's labor camps to protect their meager rights and to win 
any improvement in their living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The new law prohibits strikes in the transport, communications, power and 
defense industries; at factories in continuous production, such as steel mills, 
and against governmental bodies safeguarding national security and law and 
order. It also bans strikes that "threaten the life or health of the people," 
but it leaves these to the courts to adjudicate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Strikes Banned 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also outlaws most political strikes -- those "motivated by 
demands for the violent overthrow or change of the state or social system or 
demands leading to the violation of ethnic or racial equality." 
</P>
<P>
These limitations as a whole were criticized, however, as undermining the basic 
philosophy of the legislation and devaluing it through too many exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
One radical deputy charged that the prohibitions effectively outlawed 70% of 
strikes. But V. I. Samarin, the chairman of the committee that drafted the 
legislation, said the law actually ensures the right to strike for 65% of the 
country's industrial, commercial and government workers. 
</P>
<P>
Even the prohibitions are not automatic, Samarin said, because workers can 
appeal to the courts, and the burden of proof of the danger posed by the strike 
would be on the employers. 
</P>
<P>
Only the legislatures of the constituent republics or the Supreme Soviet itself 
can intervene to postpone a legal strike, according to the law. 
</P>
<P>
The government had called originally for a complete ban on all strikes until 
1991, arguing that proposed political, economic and social reforms needed at 
least 15 months of enforced tranquillity to take shape and be put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies immediately rebelled, arguing that such a ban was far too sweeping, 
that it extended emergency measures to regions that were quiet and that it 
undermined the process of collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strike Funds OKd 
</P>
<P>
The legislation adopted Monday authorizes the formation of strike committees, 
which so far have proved to be more militant and effective than the official 
trade union movement, and the establishment of strike funds, another first, 
through levies on workers and donations. 
</P>
<P>
When the Supreme Soviet's special commission on labor legislation began its 
discussions last summer, the bill presented by the government did not even 
refer to possible strikes, Samarin recalled, and strike committees were an 
unknown concept. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputies drafted this law themselves," he said, recounting the 
reorientation of the bill and the many debates over its underlying philosophy. 
"It is a first experiment at legislation in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Sergei S. Alexeyev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's powerful committee for 
legislation, said the law is an important step toward political pluralism and a 
system in which differences are examined and a solution found on the basis of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work on this shows the emerging outlines of a mechanism of the Supreme 
Soviet for discussing draft laws," Alexeyev said. "A lawmaking culture is 
starting to take shape."

RANCH OWNER TURNS SPREAD OVER TO SCHOOL

<P>
Al Smith's 3,300-acre ranch runs for more than three miles along the rugged 
Pacific coastline, 15 miles north of Santa Cruz. It is his favorite place on 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
To save it "from the developers and freeways and give young people a place to 
learn by doing," Smith, 68, wants to give it to his alma mater, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
He has given the idea plenty of thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a successful life. Never been married, have no children. The ranch 
has been good to me. It's open, spacious, wild. I don't want it carved into 
pieces. I hope 100 years from now people will say what a nice place this is," 
he explained as he sat in the living room of his hilltop home looking out over 
his lush spread. 
</P>
<P>
So he has decided to give it to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he received a 
bachelor's degree in 1944 in crop science and a master's degree in agriculture 
in 1956. Smith taught high school agriculture classes in Manteca for a year and 
at Campbell for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
He left teaching to launch Orchard Supply Hardware, a farm supply business and 
chain of home improvement hardware stores in Northern California. When he sold 
out 10 years ago to the W. R. Grace Co. there were 11 stores in the chain; now 
there are 32. 
</P>
<P>
Smith signed an agreement in 1986 to lease the ranch to Cal Poly for three 
years at $100 a year. He gave the school $1 million to operate the property and 
make improvements. The school and Smith recently reached an agreement for a 
five-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lease at First 
</P>
<P>
"When I die Cal Poly gets title to the place. But I want to make sure the ranch 
isn't a burden to the school, that's why I'm leasing the property at first to 
be certain Cal Poly really wants it, that it's going to work out for them as a 
working ranch run by students," Smith said. "If it isn't right for Cal Poly I 
can change my will." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is that agriculture students run the ranch as a profit-making 
commercial venture, not a research center as most university farms are. 
Agriculture students come here for a quarter or two, live here, get paid and 
learn by doing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are Ag graduates of Cal Poly who never sat on a tractor, if a cow looked 
at them crosswise they'd jump in a pickup and take off," Smith said. "Here they 
ride horses, herd cattle, run cultivators, hay bailers and tractors, irrigate, 
build fences, the whole shot." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 10 students live in an old red farmhouse on the ranch, get paid $800 
a month with free room plus $5 a day food allowance (they cook for themselves) 
and earn six units a quarter. They work from 7:30 in the morning until 5:30 at 
night, and longer if necessary, and half a day on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
"At Cal Poly I have been taking 12 units a quarter," said Todd Conrado, 20, a 
sophomore who is spending two quarters at the ranch. "Here I get credit for 
only six. I'm sacrificing a little time and will have to spend an extra quarter 
in school but it's well worth it. Here you get away from the textbook and learn 
what it's all about on a daily ranch operation." 
</P>
<P>
Ranch manager Deward Strong, 42, said that students work 150 head of brood 
cows. "They're growing Brussels sprouts, artichokes, sea beans and pumpkins. 
We're trying to keep as close to industry as possible. They are taught to do 
the budget. We're working toward a profit. What money we make we pile back into 
the operation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Land in Parcels 
</P>
<P>
Smith acquired the ranch in bits and pieces over the years. He bought his first 
parcel, 412 acres, from money he received in an injury settlement. He had lost 
his left leg in an accident while working as a trainman for Southern Pacific 
Railroad in 1943 to help pay his way through school. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong rail fan, Smith has 1 1/2 miles of track on his ranch, a rail yard 
and a roundhouse filled with five engines and rolling stock he and his railroad 
buddies restore and ride on as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I love the ranch, and I have great affection for my alma mater, Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo," observed Smith, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"By leaving the ranch to Cal Poly it looks like my dream to preserve this 
beautiful, unspoiled piece of coastal property will come true and the ranch 
will also provide a unique learning experience for farmers and ranchers of 
tomorrow as well."

OFFICIALS DISPUTE ANAHEIM TERMINUS FOR VEGAS TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles and Palmdale officials Monday challenged a consultant's finding 
that Anaheim is a better bet than the northern San Fernando Valley for the 
terminus of a proposed "gambler's special" high-speed train linking Las Vegas 
and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they factored in how much traffic would be generated if we got 
that airport going up there in Palmdale," said Los Angeles City Council 
President John Ferraro, referring to the city's long-closed Palmdale Air 
Terminal. The train route would go through Palmdale and then on to a station in 
the San Fernando Valley . 
</P>
<P>
"We desperately need that airport opened," Ferraro said, "and we'll keep 
pushing for it." 
</P>
<P>
One Palmdale official said that his Antelope Valley city would soon release its 
own report indicating that it would be less costly to route the train through 
Palmdale than through heavily congested San Bernardino and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale report also projects continued rapid population growth in the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys. It also suggests that another source of 
riders for the train -- commuters between Palmdale and the San Fernando Valley 
-- "can be expected to greatly increase," said Palmdale Mayor William Knight. 
</P>
<P>
The futuristic $4-billion train is the brainchild of Las Vegas gambling 
interests, who view it as a vehicle for bringing larger numbers of gamblers to 
Nevada hotels and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Technologies under consideration are a still-experimental West German magnetic 
levitation system, the French TGV high-speed train and the Japanese bullet 
train. 
</P>
<P>
The train would be built with private funds, but would require approval of the 
California Legislature because most of its 230 miles of track would run along 
the Interstate 15 right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant's report released Friday was prepared by the California-Nevada 
Super-Speed Ground Transportation Commission, which was created by the two 
states' legislatures to select a route. 
</P>
<P>
Ridership for an Anaheim-to-Las Vegas line was projected to be as high as 5.7 
million round-trips annually by the year 2000, and would be 6.5 million if the 
train also stops in Ontario, the consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a line between Las Vegas and the northern San Fernando Valley 
would draw a maximum of 2.3 million round-trip riders a year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The rival routes were much closer in the number of commuters they would draw. 
</P>
<P>
A separate commuter service utilizing the same tracks between Orange and San 
Bernardino counties would draw 433,000 round-trip passengers annually, while a 
similar commuter service between the northern San Fernando Valley and Palmdale 
would draw 418,000 riders, the report predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles plan, strongly supported by Mayor Tom Bradley, envisions the 
high-speed train, originating in Mission Hills or Sylmar, as a vehicle for 
relieving congestion at Los Angeles International Airport by encouraging 
passengers to use the Palmdale Air Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The air terminal, which has been unused since 1985 for lack of an airline 
willing to offer service there, is scheduled to go back into operation in 
January, when America West Airlines commences four daily flights to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County leaders, on the other hand, feel that the train would provide 
transportation for the small army of workers who daily commute to Orange County 
jobs from their homes in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, where housing 
is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, said Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth, an Anaheim terminus 
would boost tourism by encouraging vacationers to combine visits to Orange 
County, which attracts 34 millions tourists annually, with a trip to Las Vegas, 
which has 17 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, a former mayor of Anaheim and chief booster of the Orange County 
proposal, said that "it's tourism that will make the Anaheim proposal work, 
because it will provide the ridership. The commuter relief will be an extra 
benefit, although it's an important one." 
</P>
<P>
Roth, a member of the bistate commission, also said that he is investigating 
whether an Anaheim-Las Vegas train might also ferry passengers to George Air 
Force Base in Victorville, which is slated to be closed within three years and 
might be converted to a civilian airport. 
</P>
<P>
The base, located a few miles west of Interstate 15 and about 30 miles south of 
Barstow, "could be used to relieve John Wayne Airport and increase patronage on 
the train," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's Knight, acknowledging that Anaheim has the ridership edge, said 
proponents of the Palmdale route might have to take their case to the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Which is the greater need for Southern California?" he asked. "I think it's 
commuter relief and relief at Los Angeles County airports." 
</P>
<P>
The bistate commission is scheduled to use its consultant's report as a basis 
for selecting a route, possibly as early as its Oct. 27 meeting in Los Angeles.

ON CALIFORNIA: A NEW WAY OF TAKING THE INITIATIVE 
</P>

<P>
Once every few years, a political campaign comes along that serves as a 
harbinger of the future. It does something different, or takes a new risk, and 
the political world is changed. 
</P>
<P>
We may be seeing one of those watershed campaigns developing now. If Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp succeeds in becoming the next governor, many moons will 
pass before another candidate dares run for statewide office without a troika 
of ballot propositions leading the charge. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with many new directions in politics, this was a strategy born 
of trouble. Through the spring of this year Van de Kamp remained dead still in 
the polls, showing little promise of closing the gap between himself and Sen. 
Pete Wilson. So his advisers decided to invest in a new kind of solution. What 
you might call a campaign-by-proxy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of exclusively hawking Van de Kamp, which was not working, the advisers 
decided to create and hawk propositions. If the voters liked the propositions, 
then maybe the good vibes would rub off on the candidate. There is an indirect, 
almost Zen, quality to it. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, politicians have long attached themselves to ongoing initiatives in 
California when they sensed there was mileage to be gained. But rarely have 
candidates taken on the burden of sponsoring the propositions themselves. And 
no one has produced a phalanx of initiatives equal to the Van de Kamp campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly, that phalanx consists of three major efforts: an environmental measure 
dealing with everything from oil spills to the ozone layer; a 
get-tough-on-drugs act, and an ethics initiative to clean up what's usually 
called "the mess in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of this effort is huge. The rule of thumb says that it costs 
$700,000 just to qualify a statewide proposition for the ballot. All three will 
come to $2.1 million. Then you get to organize and pay for the campaigns 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Van de Kamp doing this? There are a couple of reasons, and they tell us 
something about the times in which we live. 
</P>
<P>
The first has to do with a loophole that left initiative campaigns untrammeled 
by the new, harsh limits on political contributions. As per last year's 
Proposition 73, candidates can accept only $1,000 from each contributor. But 
contributions to an initiative are unrestricted. Theoretically, Van de Kamp's 
anti-drug proposition could collect millions for television spots and feature 
Van de Kamp in all of them. None of those costs would be charged against his 
gubernatorial bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been made of the loophole business, but I think the most powerful 
motive for employing the campaign-by-proxy lies elsewhere. Someone -- most 
likely it was Richie Ross, Van de Kamp's chief consultant -- correctly 
perceived that the initiative process maintains a unique and powerful hold on 
the electorate. Rightly or wrongly, it is seen as the voters' own, the sole 
arena where they can vent their rage and frustration at a dysfunctional 
government. Tap into that emotion, associate yourself with it, and you've got 
something. 
</P>
<P>
Take this example: Van de Kamp has long been seen as a Sacramento insider, a 
career candidate. This image was hurting him, so how to change it? If he makes 
a speech denying his insider status, everyone laughs. But throw an initiative 
on the table that attacks the Willie Browns and other insiders, that limits 
their terms and makes them howl, and suddenly Van de Kamp has a new role. He is 
the enemy of the insider. 
</P>
<P>
So together these initiatives create for Van de Kamp an alter ego, an identity 
he previously lacked. Combine all three and you get this picture of the 
prospective governor: a government outsider who's tough on crime and will 
protect our air and water. Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
Because this message is delivered by initiative, it has credibility. But is 
this really Van de Kamp? Or is it a bunch of ballot propositions posing as Van 
de Kamp? Does it make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
You could argue it doesn't. The voter, after all, is getting a chance to 
pre-approve a whole legislative program. A warranty of sorts. In that sense the 
very issue of who serves as governor is somewhat diminished. His program has 
been established before he ever takes office. 
</P>
<P>
But ultimately, of course, it does make a difference. The campaign-by-proxy 
blurs reality and twists our perceptions of the man running for office. It is a 
trick, like so many modern campaign devices. Has Van de Kamp really stopped 
being a government insider because his proposition says so? You answer that. 
And will California voters buy into this latest subterfuge? We'll find out next 
November. Stay tuned.

SENATE NEARING VOTES ON WHETHER TO OUST TWO IMPEACHED U.S. JUDGES

<P>
Walter L. Nixon whiles away the days in a minimum security jail in New Orleans, 
the only federal judge in prison and only the second in history to be convicted 
of a felony while serving on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The Mississippi jurist still draws his $89,500-a-year government salary -- 
totaling more than $300,000 since his 1984 conviction for perjury. Only by 
impeachment can a federal judge be stripped of his lifetime tenure and salary, 
and years can pass while both houses of Congress conduct lengthy 
investigations, hold hearings and finally vote. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on Nixon will come up soon -- not long before he is due to be paroled. 
But, first, Congress will deal with the case of Florida Judge Alcee L. 
Hastings, the other federal judge now undergoing impeachment proceedings, on a 
perjury charge. It has taken six years to reach a final vote on whether to oust 
Hastings, a decision scheduled for the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Exceeds $1 Million 
</P>
<P>
The Hastings and Nixon cases have spurred efforts to find a way to speed up the 
process. Critics point out that, in just the last six months, two dozen 
senators and a parade of lawyers and Senate staff members have given time to 
the two impeachment proceedings. The cost so far, not including the federal 
judges' salaries, has been more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is awkward and doesn't function well as we enter the 1990s and the 
21st Century," said Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.). "It might have worked 
at the beginning of the republic . . . but it doesn't work really well any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Raoul Berger, a retired legal historian at Harvard, said that the impeachment 
process diverts Congress from its legislative work. "The savings and loan 
crisis is much more important than throwing out a judge," he said. "There's got 
to be an easier way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Berger has long advocated removal, after review, for conduct that violates the 
Constitution's dictate that judicial tenure is conditional on "good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Kastenmeier, who participated in the impeachment of U.S. Judge Harry E. 
Claiborne of Nevada three years ago, has introduced a bill to establish a 
commission to recommend ways to streamline the impeachment process. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) is pushing for a constitutional 
amendment that would allow Congress to delegate much of the work of impeachment 
to a panel of judges and lawyers, who would conduct the investigation and 
trial. The system is modeled after one Heflin helped develop for state judges 
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Either approach will face opposition from those who feel that a cumbersome, 
complex removal process is a deliberate safeguard of judicial independence. 
</P>
<P>
Article II of the Constitution stipulates "high crimes and misdemeanors" as 
offenses for which Congress may impeach a President, vice president or federal 
judge, and it requires that the House investigate and impeach (indict), after 
which the Senate must try the case. 
</P>
<P>
During the drafting of the Constitution, James Madison took exception to a 
suggestion that impeachable offenses include "maladministration." He warned 
that the inclusion of that offense would be tantamount to judges' serving at 
the "pleasure of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of considerable gravity to the whole government when one branch 
of government removes another," said David O. Stewart, Judge Nixon's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Tinkering with one part of our governmental structure is very risky business," 
added Stephen Burbank, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it should be easy to impeach a federal judge," said David 
Sellers, a spokesman for the federal court system. Sellers warned that changes 
in the system could create as many problems as they solve and said that 
tampering with lifetime tenure could open the door for political manipulation 
of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
No one denies that the present system, whatever its merit, is time-consuming. 
The Hastings case is a textbook example. 
</P>
<P>
A Florida jury acquitted Hastings in 1983 of charges that he conspired to 
accept a bribe. But evidence suggested that Hastings might have lied under oath 
during the investigation, and an impeachment process was started. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence of Perjury 
</P>
<P>
A panel of fellow judges investigated for more than three years before 
concluding that there was enough evidence to try Hastings for perjury. The 
issue then went before a House panel for investigation, debate and a vote. Then 
it went to the full House, which voted 413 to 3 to try Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, a Senate committee spent four weeks hearing the case. On Oct. 
24, the whole Senate, in closed session, is scheduled to vote on whether 
Hastings will be the sixth federal judge in history to be convicted by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, meanwhile, has been undergoing an identical series of hearings since a 
jury in 1984 convicted him of two counts of perjury when he denied intervening 
in a narcotics case involving the son of a business executive who had given him 
good deals on oil investments. In May, the House voted, 417 to 0, for 
impeachment. A Senate panel heard the case in early September, and the full 
Senate is expected to vote on Nixon's case soon after Hasting's.

It was a close encounter of the Communist kind. 
</P>
<P>
Towering, tiny-headed humanoids from outer space landed in the Soviet city of 
Voronezh and emerged from their spacecraft for a promenade around the park, 
spreading fear among residents. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what the official Tass news agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tass, contributing to a string of weird tales that have crept into the formerly 
stuffy state-controlled media in recent months, said, "Scientists have 
confirmed that an unidentified flying object recently landed in a park in the 
Russian city of Voronezh. They have also identified the landing site and found 
traces of aliens who made a short promenade about the park." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet media, unleashed by the Kremlin's policy of glasnost, feel free now 
to hype incredible stories that seem more at home in the supermarket tabloids 
of the West. Recent examples have included other accounts of UFOs, sightings of 
Abominable Snowman-type creatures and a tale about a young mystic who goes into 
a trance and flies about the cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's Tass report, a large shining ball or disk was seen 
hovering over the park by residents of Voronezh, a city 300 miles southeast of 
Moscow. They saw the UFO land and up to three creatures similar to humans 
emerge, accompanied by a small robot, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
"The aliens were three or even four meters (9 to 12 feet) tall, but with very 
small heads," the news agency quoted witnesses as saying. "They walked near the 
ball or disk and then disappeared inside." 
</P>
<P>
The report, which did not give the date of the purported landing in Voronezh, 
said onlookers were "overwhelmed with a fear that lasted for several days." 
</P>
<P>
Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, told Tass that 
scientists investigating the UFO report found a 20-yard depression with four 
deep dents, as well as two pieces of unidentified rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"At first glance, they looked like sandstone of a deep-red color. However, 
mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance cannot be found on Earth," 
Tass quoted Silanov as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Silanov said the landing site and path taken by the aliens was confirmed using 
the "biolocation" method of tracking. The agency did not explain what that was. 
</P>
<P>
A Tass duty officer, contacted Monday evening by telephone, refused to identify 
the reporter who sent the dispatch from Voronezh but stood by the story. "It is 
not April Fool's today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report resembled a story last summer in the daily newspaper Socialist 
Industry, which carried an alleged "close encounter" between a milkmaid and an 
alien in Central Russia's Perm region. 
</P>
<P>
In that report, Lyubov Medvedev was quoted as saying she encountered an alien 
creature "resembling a man, but taller than average, with short legs." The 
creature, she said, had "only a small knob instead of a head."

HUNGARY'S RULING PARTY OKS REFORMERS; 
</P>
<P>
LIBERALS GIVEN KEY POSTS AS RENAMED SOCIALISTS AVERT A SCHISM

<TEXT>
<P>
Reformers in Hungary's newly reorganized and renamed ruling party pushed 
through a leadership slate dominated by liberals Monday. But it took a serious 
threat to bolt the party -- and the specter of a disastrous three-way party 
split -- in order for the reformers to carry the day. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for control of the party went on primarily in back rooms as the 
reformers argued it out with elder party barons, insisting on the need to forge 
a new public personality for the once-orthodox Communist Party that has 
dominated Hungarian politics for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
In what has been a watershed party congress, the party Saturday dropped its old 
name, the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, and adopted its new one, the 
Hungarian Socialist Party. Founding documents say the party's new goals are a 
free-market economy and a democratically elected Parliament, as well as a 
competitive party with Euro-Communist and social democratic leanings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discards Marxist-Leninist Line 
</P>
<P>
It has also officially discarded its Marxist-Leninist ideological baggage, 
making it the first East Bloc ruling party to part company with a line once 
strictly dictated by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a need to add some more people to the reform line," said Attila Agh, 
one of the reform delegates. "We also needed to give some fuller representation 
to the countryside." 
</P>
<P>
Out of 24 seats on the party's policy-setting Presidium, sources said, the 
reform forces -- led by Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth -- succeeded in winning at 
least 14 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Party liberals said they are encouraged that 13 of the new members of the 
Presidium -- which corresponds to the party's old Politburo -- had never before 
held high positions in the party. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very liberal lineup," said one reform-oriented delegate. "I think it 
is a very good result." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the group are the party's leading liberals -- Imre Pozsgay, now 
minister of state and an announced candidate for the Hungarian presidency; 
Gyula Horn, the foreign minister who precipitated the East German refugee 
crisis by opening Hungary's borders with the West; Rezsoe Nyers, the party 
chairman, whose reform credentials extend back 20 years in Hungarian politics, 
and Nemeth. 
</P>
<P>
But for all its historic shift, the party's leading reformers have a 
well-grounded fear that the change may not be sufficient to overcome years of 
Communist economic, political and cultural domination, and that upcoming 
parliamentary elections -- the first fully free elections here in 40 years -- 
will send them to resounding defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Four by-elections in the last year, in which Communists were resoundingly 
defeated, have given the party a dismal forecast of its fortunes. Most 
well-informed political observers say the party will be lucky to capture 20% of 
the seats in the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of those gloomy predictions, the balance of power in the party has 
swung clearly to the reformers. 
</P>
<P>
But the congress -- notable as a Communist Party congress that actually voted 
itself out of existance -- still has had to deal with old-line party concerns 
for unity and stability, despite its proclamation of change. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians hashing all this out at the congress were faced with a decision 
over whether to go for a wholesale revamping of the party -- including the 
public expulsion of its old-line members and an embarrassingly open washing of 
political dirty linen. 
</P>
<P>
Nyers, whose reformist credentials are somewhat colored by his old-line 
instincts to preserve party unity, attempted to placate party conservatives but 
found himself in a head-to-head contest Monday with Nemeth, who pressed for a 
party leadership that would offer the public a clear image of change. 
</P>
<P>
Party sources said Nemeth and Pozsgay threatened to take their followers out of 
the party if Nyers, who had been tapped as party chairman, refused to accept a 
clear reformist majority in the new Presidium. 
</P>
<P>
Although the negotiations were said to have hung in the balance for several 
tense hours, Nyers relented, and the number of Presidium members was expanded 
to 24 from 21, with the decisive balance going to Nemeth's reformers. 
</P>
<P>
A split would have been disastrous to Pozsgay, whose campaign for the Hungarian 
presidency depends on having a party base for organizational support. If the 
party had split -- a likely three-way cleavage between radical reformers, 
moderates and hard-liners -- its considerable organizational assests would have 
been negated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Problems 
</P>
<P>
However, the long-term fortunes of the party do not seem bright, and some of 
the radical reformers believe their interests may have been better served by a 
noisy severance of party connections. 
</P>
<P>
These elements say that the party cannot avoid a debacle at the polls next year 
and argue that they stand a better chance of forming a truly new and 
competitive party by emphasizing their departure from their Communist 
antecedents. 
</P>
<P>
The party's congress was remarkable, participants said, for its unscripted, 
almost improvisational quality. For the first time in the party's history, they 
noted with some amazement, the proceedings took on some of the unpredictable 
nature of the kind of political convention not seen in this part of the world 
for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
It was also likely, they noted, that it would be the last time the party would 
be able to attract the attention it once naturally assumed as the ruling 
political force in Hungary.

RED CROSS KIDNAPINGS TIED TO ABU NIDAL

SIDON, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said Monday that two Red Cross officials abducted last week are being 
held by radical Palestinian guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Nidal's group has denied taking part in the kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have established that Abu Nidal's men carried out the abduction. We believe 
the hostages are held in a base east of Sidon," said a police spokesman, who 
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
He said the base is "between the villages of Majdaloun and Bkosta," three miles 
east of Sidon, the provincial capital of southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abu Nidal Controls Area 
</P>
<P>
"The area is controlled exclusively by Abu Nidal's group," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Masked gunmen grabbed the two Swiss men, Emmanuel Christen, 32, and Elio 
Erriquez, 23, in Sidon on Friday, bundled them into the trunk of a car and 
drove off toward the Ein el Hilwa Palestinian refugee camp on Sidon's 
southeastern outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the kidnapers drove through Ein el Hilwa to their 
base east of Sidon. The refugee camp is controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestine 
Liberation Organization, which is at odds with Abu Nidal's breakaway faction. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether police would attempt to rescue the hostages, the spokesman said: 
"We don't have the necessary force to do that. We have investigators, but not a 
strike force." 
</P>
<P>
Government and police authority have been severely eroded by 14 years of civil 
war between Christians and Muslims, leaving power largely in the hands of 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Red Cross Noncommittal 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Abu Nidal's reported involvement in the abductions, Roland Sidler, 
chief delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross in southern 
Lebanon, said, "We have no new information about our missing colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council issued a statement in Beirut on 
Saturday condemning the abductions and offering to help free the men, but 
police and the PLO have said they do not take the statement seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Nidal is the nom de guerre of Sabri Banna, who broke away from Arafat's 
mainstream Fatah group in 1973. His faction has been blamed for a score of 
terrorist attacks, including the December, 1985, attacks on the Rome and Vienna 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of students in Lebanon flocked back to classes 
Monday as most schools and colleges reopened for the first time since shelling 
forced them to close in March. 
</P>
<P>
All of Lebanon's state schools, most private schools and the American 
University of Beirut reopened in the biggest sign that peace had returned to 
Lebanon since a cease-fire last month. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has an estimated 600,000 schoolchildren. Official figures on how many 
returned Monday were not available.

HE SPINS HIS WHEEL IN LONGTIME CHASE OF AN ELUSIVE DREAM

<P>
It looks like a Ferris wheel without seats. 
</P>
<P>
It's Charlie Spurlock's "perpetual motion wheel," a towering landmark in this 
small San Joaquin Valley farm center. 
</P>
<P>
Spurlock, 75, has worked on and off for 37 years in his spare time trying to 
get the wheel to spin without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of getting it perfectly counterbalanced. I think I've been 
close, but close doesn't count," sighed Spurlock as he turned the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The retired home builder and lumberyard owner hasn't given up, but he doesn't 
spend much time with his dream now. He has been in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I get out here and tinker with it now and then. Spin it. Check the 
weights. I still think somebody will come up with a perpetual motion device. I 
would like to be that person," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
He's convinced it will happen "because it says so in the Bible. Ezekiel in his 
prophesies said there would appear a perpetual motion wheel on Earth." Although 
many would dispute Spurlock's interpretation of Ezekiel 1:15-23, he has no 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Bewildered 
</P>
<P>
His wife of 51 years, Doris, 71, just shakes her head in bewilderment. "He has 
spent at least $20,000 on it. In the beginning, two men helped him with it. He 
has tried all kinds of different ideas, trying to get it to work. 
</P>
<P>
"He will never take it down. He will never sell this piece of property the 
wheel stands on." 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever get this to work," Spurlock allowed, "people from all over the world 
will come to Planada to see it. Man, I could put motion in cars and everything 
else with no noise, with nothing to drive it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he kept on all these years "because I have faith. I've been laughed at 
but many great inventors were laughed at before they succeeded. I may be a 
fool, but fools can do wonders." 
</P>
<P>
"I have grown up watching Charlie work on that wheel," said Lois Halstead, 
clerk in the Planada Post Office. "I was 4 years old when he first started. He 
is persistent." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Richards, 77, a retired garage owner who sits in his living room and looks 
out at Charlie Spurlock's wheel, said half the people in town have always 
thought it would work and half thought it wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie's a smart guy, a good engineer. He has a lot of confidence," said 
Richards. "He poured a lot of time and money into the wheel. I have always had 
a hunch that maybe he was onto something, that maybe someday it would spin and 
just keep spinning on its own."

SCHOOL BUS HIT ON FREEWAY BY TRUCK; 23 HURT

A tractor-trailer rig struck a school bus on the Santa Ana Freeway on Monday 
afternoon, touching off a chain-reaction that included another school bus and 
two passenger vehicles but causing only minor injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty high school students returning home from school in the San Fernando 
Valley and three drivers of the involved vehicles were taken to hospitals for 
treatment after they complained of various injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the first bus, Connie Huston, 48, was treated for cuts on her 
hands suffered when the bus windshield shattered and folded back onto the 
steering wheel, California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Weddle said. 
</P>
<P>
The others had X-rays and underwent general examinations, said Dr. David 
Wagner, a physician in the emergency room of County-USC Medical Center, where 
nine of the injured were taken. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the students were a little dazed and a little upset. It caught them by 
surprise," Wagner said. "But they are handling it pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the 4:30 p.m. accident on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway near 
Brooklyn Avenue was under investigation, 
</P>
<P>
"There is some indication that there was inattentive driving on the part of the 
operator of the tractor-trailer," Weddle said. "Apparently he had diverted his 
attention momentarily and when he turned back forward, he saw that the bus 
stopped. He tried to brake but there wasn't enough room." 
</P>
<P>
Weddle said the truck driver, Thomas Dalton, 62, of Los Alamos, told officers 
he was traveling about 40 m.p.h. when he saw that traffic in front of him had 
come to a stop. At the time of impact with the first bus, Dalton's rig was 
going at least 30 m.p.h., Weddle said. 
</P>
<P>
"It pushed in the back bumper of the first bus five feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the freeway was backed up for about two miles, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
The buses had picked up students from Taft High School in Woodland Hills and 
were bound for drop-off points near Ascot and Hooper elementary schools in 
South Los Angeles.

After two years without a contract and three without a pay increase, Yolo 
County sheriff's deputies are turning to the voters for a raise. 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks with the county have stalled, and deputies are taking action to 
put a pay-raise initiative on the June or November ballot next year. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies became the lowest-paid law enforcement officers in the county in 
September, when the small farm town of Winters gave its police force a raise. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Yolo County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. voted unanimously to spend 
$5,000 to draft the initiative and prepare petitions, said Deputy Larry Garcia, 
the association's vice president. Deputies need signatures of 10% of the 
county's voters to qualify the measure for the ballot. 
</P>

Deputies presently earn between $1,780 and $2,163 a month.

NON-VITAL 911 CALLERS, DRUNKS TO BE BILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
People who make non-emergency telephone calls to the 911 telephone number and 
drunks taken to the city jail will be billed under a new program adopted 
unanimously Monday night by the Garden Grove City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The program, believed to be unique in Southern California, is designed to 
recover some of the costs associated with taking care of drunks and responding 
to 911 calls that turn out to be non-emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the first time in the United States that these fees would be 
imposed," said Garden Grove Police Chief John R. Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
He said approximately 400 people -- only 39% of whom are residents of the city 
-- are arrested each year in the city for public intoxication. The annual cost 
of making the arrests, processing the suspects and monitoring them for the five 
hours they typically spend in jail is estimated at $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
To help offset that expense, Garden Grove police proposed that those arrested 
be charged $118 for their stay in the municipal jail. 
</P>
<P>
"The Police department does not feel that the ciTizens of the community should 
be responsible for the costs associated with the arrest and custodial 
maintenance of these subjects," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there are no other cities found to be collecting for this service," 
according to a police staff report. 
</P>
<P>
That $118 cost to the person arrested is based on a formula that puts a 
policeman's time at 99 cents a minute and factors in the time spent in 
"baby-sitting the individual through the detoxification period," according to 
Robertson, as well as the periodic checks that must be made on the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
How much money the city will recover is unknown. In the existing "Intoxicated 
Drivers Cost Recovery Program," Garden Grove has recovered monies from 42% of 
the responsible parties, according to a police report, representing 32% of the 
cost of handling traffic accidents connected to drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
"You might think that people arrested for public drunkenness have no resources. 
But we've researched this and found that they match the profile of the drunk 
driver," said Robertson. He added that the city has arranged with a private 
legal firm to help collect the amounts owed. 
</P>
<P>
The cost-recovery program is aimed at raising money without increasing taxes. A 
similar program for fire inspections and reviews was approved by the Garden 
Grove council in September. 
</P>
<P>
People misusing the 911 emergency phone line will also be billed by the city 
for police time. A charge of 99 cents per officer per minute has been 
established as a fee responsible parties must pay when a non-emergency call is 
made on the 911 line. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the department received 1,255 non-emergency calls, including children 
playing with the phone and people accidentally dialing 911 and failing to call 
back and advise police that there was no emergency. The cost of responding to 
these calls was set at $41,659. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who calls the emergency line will be billed, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted that the individual who calls on 911 but does not meet the 
criteria for using the 911 system will be requested to call back on a regular 
business line. This person will not be charged for misuse unless repeated 
misuse has been determined," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A related proposal to increase fees for a variety of police reports, 
establishing fees for bingo license renewal and increasing fees for issuing 
badges to people who administer the games, was referred back to the city staff 
for further study.

IT'S A GOOD YEAR FOR FLEAS, BAD FOR HUMANS AND FIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The house sat vacant for weeks, but that did not bother the fleas. 
</P>
<P>
Although the household pet had moved on, the fleas patiently bided their time, 
reproducing themselves, hatching out of eggs and becoming increasingly ravenous 
while waiting for a warm-blooded animal to wander by to provide a long-awaited 
feast. 
</P>
<P>
"You go in and all of a sudden you've got fleas all over your legs, covering 
you," said Marge Duncan, a real estate associate with Century 21 Realty in 
Mission Viejo. "It can be pretty awful." 
</P>
<P>
For untold numbers of Orange County residents, the annual battle against the 
blood-sucking varmints has been particularly difficult this year, as a warm, 
damp September offered perfect conditions for fleas to go about the things they 
do best: eating, reproducing, and annoying people and pets. Though exact 
figures are hard to come by, several pest control companies report that their 
flea business is up noticeably. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an extremely tough year for fleas," said Brian Olson, general 
manager of The Bugman, a Fullerton pest control company. Tony Alcantar of Vint 
Pest Control in Santa Ana agreed. "They've kept us hopping," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
According to Olson, The Bugman's flea business is up 40% over this time last 
year, and he puts most of the blame on homeowners, whom he and other flea 
experts say often do not know the basics of flea combat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance of Dipping 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of homeowners aren't aware that it's important to have their pets 
dipped, in addition to treating their homes," said Paul Lew, production 
coordinator for Mission Pest Control. Lew said his firm has not had a 
noticeable increase in flea business this year but added that about half the 
company's 300 to 400 calls a day come from customers who have felt the stinging 
bite of a flea. 
</P>
<P>
The pest professionals recommend that flea-afflicted pet owners and others 
thoroughly vacuum their homes, throwing away the vacuum cleaner bag once the 
place is clean. Bedding and anything else that the pet is associated with 
should be washed and machine-dried and the animal flea-dipped by a 
professional. Then the house needs a shroud of chemicals that stay in the 
carpet -- a favorite flea hideaway -- and kills the little pests as they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeowner's part is about 70% of controlling fleas," Alcantar said. 
"Customers need to take the time to educate themselves." 
</P>
<P>
But while home and pet owners can improve the situation, many factors are out 
of their control. There is the weather, for example, which experts say could be 
a chief reason for this year's flourishing flea population. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Humidity Factor 
</P>
<P>
"We've has some pretty good humid weather in September, and that could be a 
factor," said Rudy Geck, a vector ecologist with the Orange County Vector 
Control District, the agency that rides herd on pests. "Those climatic 
conditions contribute to the propagation of fleas." 
</P>
<P>
While cautioning that no hard figures exist to compare this year with previous 
ones, other flea experts agree that the weather has been good for the insects. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have warm temperatures and the relative humidity is high, that's when 
you get most fleas," said Michael Rust, a UC Riverside entomologist who 
specializes in the study of fleas, cockroaches and other urban insects. Rust 
currently is studying fleas, remarkably resolute creatures that can go for 
months without eating and can jump enormous distances on their tiny legs. 
</P>
<P>
Because fleas thrive and reproduce in warm, damp weather, winter usually brings 
a natural decline in their population. And although some pest control employees 
warn that indoor heating can provide the bugs with safe haven for the winter, 
Rust believes that relief is just around the corner for most residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, with the heating on, the air becomes drier," he said. "While the 
temperature is sufficient, the lower humidity is deleterious to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role in Epidemics 
</P>
<P>
Fleas, all 2,237 species of them, have pestered mankind for as long as anyone 
can remember. The bugs, which latch on to all manner of warm-blooded "hosts," 
have been implicated in epidemics no less serious than the 14th-Century's Great 
Plague, and occasional sporadic cases of bubonic plague surface even today. On 
a milder note, some people and pets are allergic to flea bites, and suffer 
swelling and irritation as a result. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, experts agree that fleas are more of an annoyance than a 
genuine health hazard. County vector control, which targets disease-carrying 
pests for monitoring and eradication, all but ignores fleas, leaving them to 
private enterprise to control. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is just the nuisance factor," Geck said. "They're pretty 
exasperating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FACTS ABOUT FLEAS 
</P>
<P>
Fleas are small, wingless insects that live on humans, dogs, cats, rats, birds, 
horses, poultry, rabbits and many wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
They suck blood for food, using their beaks to puncture skin. They usually feed 
once a day. They can, however, survive for several weeks or even months without 
food. 
</P>
<P>
Fleas have flat sides and a head much smaller than the rest of their bodies. 
Strong legs help them move quickly through the hairs (or feathers) of their 
host. And they have great leaping prowess. 
</P>
<P>
When a flea bites, it injects a salivary secretion into the wound. It is this, 
experts suspect, that causes itching. 
</P>
<P>
Human reactions to flea bites can vary greatly -- some people seem to never be 
bitten while others may be allergic to them. To the latter, a single bite can 
cause great swelling and inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
Fleas carry such diseases as plague and murine typhus. 
</P>
<P>
The best protection against fleas is cleanliness (fleas can live for a short 
time in dust and debris) and proper care of pets. Pets that have fleas should 
be treated with a commercial flea powder or spray that contains either rotenone 
or pyrethrum, both of which should kill the fleas.

TUSTIN COUNCIL FIGHT STARTS RECALL TALK; HOTEL PLAN IN DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rancorous battle raging among members of the Tustin City Council may have led 
to the loss of an important hotel project in the city and may result in a 
recall campaign to oust at least one of the two outspoken councilmen who 
opposed the development. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 20 Tustin residents, including homeowner association leaders, met 
Monday night and considered during a closed-door meeting whether to begin a 
campaign to oust council members John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott. Afterward, a 
spokeswoman said the residents decided that they first need to raise public 
awareness about the councilmen's actions. 
</P>
<P>
The move toward a possible recall follows the Marriott Corp.'s backing out of 
the proposed Promenade redevelopment project. That development, planned for a 
site just south of the Santa Ana Freeway at Newport Avenue, would have included 
a 105-room Marriott Hotel, a Carl's Jr. restaurant, plus office and retail 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed hotel, which would have offered moderately priced rooms, was 
expected to have generated about $3 million in revenue for the city over the 
life of the project. 
</P>
<P>
With Marriott pulling out, the entire project is dead, according to City 
Manager William A. Huston. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be some time before you see another project this good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the Promenade plan was the proposal for a $1-million property tax 
rebate to the developer. Kelly and Prescott, who bitterly opposed the city 
subsidy of the Promenade plan, had called the project "a scandal" and a 
"million-dollar raid on the city treasury . . . to line the pockets of rich 
developers." 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of rhetoric, plus a growing dissension among council members, 
that may have led to Marriott's backing out, some city officials speculate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's conjecture because we have nothing formally (from Marriott), but we were 
told verbally that a factor was the controversy (on the council)," Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey, a supporter of the project, said, "I feel 
sad for the city of Tustin that their (Kelly's and Prescott's) shenanigans may 
have been the final straw" in Marriott's decision to drop its plans. Hoesterey 
had joined forces with Mayor Ursula E. Kennedy and Councilman Richard B. Edgar 
in the council clash. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also sad," Hoesterey said, "that this type of embarrassment has been 
brought to our community by the actions of these two individuals. I'm concerned 
about the long-range effect it will have on the overall reputation the city of 
Tustin has in the state. We've always been known as a dignified city. Now 
there's a black eye on the community," 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Prescott said they are proud that their relentless opposition to the 
Promenade project may have led to its death. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled," Kelly said. "We didn't just lie down and take it from the 
council majority. We went out and let a lot of the folks know how upset we are 
and that we saw it as a misuse of public funds." 
</P>
<P>
Hoesterey argued that the Promenade project isn't all that is at stake in the 
matter. He contended that the political climate that may have led to Marriott's 
backing out may also scare away other developers who were interested in doing 
redevelopment projects in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott officials familiar with the proposed Tustin project could not be 
reached for comment. Cody Small, a spokesman for the developer, CMS Co. of 
Costa Mesa, refused to say exactly why Marriott pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real sensitive. I have no comment on it," he said. "Right now we are 
trying to come up with another plan to work with." 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Huston said: "The whole deal was based on a package. With the 
hotel pulling out, the economics from our standpoint aren't there. The 
developer may want to resubmit, but anything less than the proposal talked 
about for 1 1/2 years will not get support of our staff for redevelopment 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Shingleton, the city's director of development, said Marriott 
officials also had other concerns about the project, stated by the developer, 
and a "thin line was holding it (the deal) together. It wasn't their most 
exciting site . . . because of its size and shape," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the market value was too high -- more than what Marriott 
wanted to pay for the land, which may have required the developer to spend more 
money. "The developer was saying it could be a money loser." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason for the loss of the hotel project, a residents group Monday 
night met to discuss whether to begin a recall effort against Kelly and 
Prescott. The newly formed group, Citizens for a Responsible Tustin Council, 
asked for the two councilmen's resignations at the City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely deplore Kelly's attempt at the last meeting to muzzle citizen 
input, and we object to Prescott and his actions," said Marge Kasalek, who 
hosted the meeting in her Peppertree home. "It's a matter of getting this out 
to the public and then, very possibly, recall is a next step." 
</P>
<P>
Kasalek said if the public information campaign does result in a recall effort, 
it will likely be aimed at Prescott, whose term of office expires in 1992. 
Since Kelly is up for reelection in 1990, the group will instead try to find 
candidates to oppose him, she said.

UC IRVINE JOINS HOSPITALS OFFERING PREVENTIVE CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON SAMUELS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine's medical school, in an effort to increase community awareness of 
preventive medicine, announced Monday that it will offer a new executive health 
program to Orange County businesses and residents. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the UCI College of Medicine say the program is designed to 
assess, identify and treat major risk factors leading to chronic or 
catastrophic disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, one change in a person's life style can alter potential problems," 
said Dr. James Lindberg, the program's director. "Just lowering the blood 
pressure of a person can prevent a fatal heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, health-care programs created for the corporate world also bring 
high financial rewards for medical institutions, which reap new patients not 
only for the initial checkup but also for the subsequent treatment of illnesses 
that have been diagnosed. The programs also can boost the public image of the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials at UCI -- which owns financially troubled UCI Medical Center 
in Orange -- said money and image were not their prime motivation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Need ... in Community' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main reasons for this program is because there is a real need for 
preventive information in the community," Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
According to UCI medical officials, the billions of dollars spent each year by 
businesses on employee health care could be reduced by early detection of 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
UCI joins two other Orange County institutions -- United Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana and Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center -- in offering 
executive health programs. 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation offered by UCI is tailored to the individual, depending on age, 
medical history and needs. 
</P>
<P>
During the procedure, a complete analysis of the patient's current state of 
health is determined by screening for diseases and assessing cardiovascular 
fitness. The tests will be given at the new UCI Medical Plaza on the university 
campus. Patients may be referred to the medical center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, a computer analyzes the patient's health habits, such as 
diet, activity levels, stress levels, cancer risks and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
When the evaluation is complete, the information is compiled in a report, which 
a physician from the program reviews with the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes our plan different from other wellness programs is that, following 
the comprehensive medical report reviewing all pertinent areas of health risk, 
our physicians personally review the data with the patient and recommend 
changes," Lindberg said. "Other plans either mail the results or have 
physicians briefly go over them by telephone. We feel that personal counseling 
is essential to individual goals." 
</P>
<P>
The program will cost about $1,000 per person. So far, the hospital has 
obtained one client, Ford Aerospace in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lindberg acknowledged that the increase in privately insured patients will help 
UCI Medical Center's ailing financial status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hospital Will Benefit' 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this hospital will benefit from the new private patients this 
program will attract," Lindberg said, "as it will also allow us to fund various 
other programs the university is interested in and wants to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, UCI Medical Center threatened to drop its Medi-Cal contract 
because of money woes. The medical center, which has 6% of the county's 
hospital beds, treats more than half of the indigent patients, according to 
officials. They say the hospital was being reimbursed for just half of those 
patients' costs. 
</P>
<P>
"'We have no problem with the hospital having programs that bring in more 
funding," said Vicki Mayster, health advocate for a nonprofit organization that 
assists the poor. "We realize the hospital has to have resources to keep many 
of its programs available and also to avoid bankruptcy."

SCHOOL DISTRICT ASKS DISMISSAL OF TEXT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Capistrano Unified School District has asked a federal court in Santa Ana 
to dismiss a $300,000 lawsuit that accuses the district of copying elementary 
school workbooks without paying for them. 
</P>
<P>
Educators Publishing Services Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., alleged in the suit 
filed Sept. 5 that the district had routinely bought single copies of workbooks 
over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Educators sometimes order just one copy of a book to look at it and see whether 
they want to buy it, but Capistrano developed a pattern of buying one copy, 
said Robert Baker, a Los Angeles attorney for the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The company could not show that the district was illegally copying the 
workbooks for classroom use until an individual, who asked to remain anonymous, 
sent copies of workbooks distributed without the author's and publisher's names 
to the publisher, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the district infringed on six copyrights over the last 
year and seeks $300,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The district will ask that the suit be dismissed, based on copyright laws that 
allow some copyrighted materials to be reproduced in an educational setting, 
said attorney Richard Hamilton, whose Sacramento firm of Biddle &amp; Hamilton 
is representing the district. A hearing is scheduled in U.S. District Court in 
Santa Ana on Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he will also argue that the district has immunity under the 11th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits a citizen from suing a state 
where he is not a resident. The district may be considered a state in this 
case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He will also argue that the statute of limitations has expired. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (the publisher) has known about it for 10 years, it may be that his 
cause of action has run out," Hamilton said.

CAB COMPANY REQUESTS 18% FARE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Saying it is faced with rising maintenance, labor and insurance costs, one of 
the largest taxicab companies in Orange County wants to raise fares 18% in the 
12 cities it serves. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast Yellow Cab, which has more than 100 taxis, has proposed increasing 
the charge for the first mile from $3.10 to $3.30, and raising the rate for 
each additional mile from $1.40 to $1.60. The company has also proposed raising 
the hourly waiting fee from $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
By the proposed rates, the cost of taking a cab from the Newporter Inn in 
Newport Beach to John Wayne Airport, for example, would rise from about $8.70 
to $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
"Drivers have had no increase in pay in at least three years, and everything is 
going up on us, such as insurance and maintenance," said Bill Craig, manager of 
taxi operations for Yellow Cab. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast Yellow Cab serves Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, 
Huntington Beach, Irvine, Newport Beach, Orange, Santa Ana, Seal Beach, 
Stanton, Tustin and Westminster. The rate increase must be approved by each 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Without debate Monday night, the Newport Beach City Council voted 7 to 0 to 
approve the increase. It is the first city to take up the proposal. Newport 
Beach approved similar rate increases for the company in 1981 and 1985. The 
change would apply to all cab companies operating in the city -- Diamond Cab, 
California Sunshine Cab and West Coast Cab. 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the company plans to have all the necessary approvals by Dec. 1 and 
to raise all the rates at once.

LAGUNA NIGUEL CITYHOOD FOES UNSWAYED BY ROSY FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

If Laguna Niguel were to become a city, it would enjoy a heathly $3.5-million 
surplus in its first full year of cityhood, according to a financial study 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The study, made for the Laguna Niguel Community Services District, updated a 
cityhood feasibility survey made last year that projected a $1.8-million 
surplus in the first year of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
But rapid growth in both population and commercial development in the Laguna 
Niguel area is expected to nearly double that amount, according to the study 
released Monday. The new projections also assumed the cost of 30 sheriff's 
deputies, compared to the cost of 14 deputies in the initial study. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of cityhood for Laguna Niguel hailed the findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Solved the Question' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've solved the question about are we feasible (for cityhood)," said 
Denny Harris, a member of the executive committee of Citizens for Cityhood, an 
organization spearheading the move for Laguna Niguel to become a city in the 
Nov. 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be more than adequately funded," Harris said at a news 
conference called to discuss the financial projections. 
</P>
<P>
But Debi Larsen, a spokeswoman for an opposition group called Stop Cityhood, 
said she is not swayed by the new report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only a proposed budget," Larsen said. "We still think they are pushing 
cityhood too fast. The courts still haven't decided what will become of the 
coastal strip, and we think that should be settled before we talk about 
cityhood." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen was referring to Laguna Niguel's legal battle to regain Monarch Beach, 
which is now part of the new city of Dana Point. The 4th District Court of 
Appeal in Santa Ana is expected to rule on the issue next year. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and other Citizens for Cityhood supporters contend that incorporation is 
Laguna Niguel's best chance to recover Monarch Beach. "We have to become a city 
so that the court will have a place to put Monarch Beach when they take it away 
from Dana Point," Harris has said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Afford It, Foes Say 
</P>
<P>
Stop Cityhood, with about 25 members, contends the community cannot afford the 
expenses of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
But Harris said the new report, prepared by Christensen &amp; Wallace Inc. of 
Oceanside, shows that Laguna Niguel can easily afford cityhood. "This study is 
very conservative and tells us we are going to make it nicely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said: "If the carry-over balance from the interim year is considered 
as revenue for the operating year, the general fund surplus amounts to 
$3,529,332, or 30.9%, of general fund revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel's population is about 38,000 -- an increase of 11,000 residents 
in a year, according to the study. The community is expected to grow to 67,000 
in the next 10 years. And new commercial construction already under way is 
projected to generate $1.5 million more a year in sales tax revenue than 
originally forecast. 
</P>
<P>
If a majority of those residents voting Nov. 7 favor cityhood, Laguna Niguel 
would become incorporated Dec. 1. The Dec. 1-June 30, 1990, period would be an 
"interim year," the study noted. The city's first full year of operation would 
be from July 1, 1990, to June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, during the news conference, raised the issue of a proposed jail site in 
Laguna Niguel as another plus for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
"As an unincorporated area, Laguna Niguel would not have a lot to say (about a 
jail site), but as a city, we could have a lot to say," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris referred to an updated environmental impact report approved last month 
by the county Board of Supervisors. That report listed the South County Civic 
Center at Alicia Parkway and Crown Valley Parkway as a possible jail site, 
triggering an uproar among some Laguna Niguel residents. County officials, 
however, said the report was a legal document in a pending court case and that 
Laguna Niguel has nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
But Cindy O'Neal, a member of the planning committee for the Laguna Niguel 
Community Council, said she is not reassured by repeated statements from county 
officials that Laguna Niguel has nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
"I most definitely think this is another reason why we should be in favor of 
cityhood," O'Neal said.

RAMS WEREN'T HURT ALL THAT MUCH WHEN GREG BELL WAS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The runners are stacked so deep on the Rams' tailback turf that Sunday's 
game-ending injury to Greg Bell, the league's leading rusher at the time, 
almost warmed a coach's heart. Bell's coach! 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say, 'Oh boy, good, you're hurt,' " John Robinson said of Bell's 
slight hamstring pull. "But I thought to myself, 'Geez, I'm going to get to 
play these other guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
Such are the luxuries of 5-0 coaches with bus loads of talent. 
</P>
<P>
After Bell's injury forced him out of the game in the second quarter, Robinson 
simply opened the refrigerator and grabbed two first-round draft picks, 
Cleveland Gary and Gaston Green, and Robert Delpino, a fifth-round choice who 
plays in a much higher league. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Sunday's 26-14 victory over the Atlanta Falcons provided a 
glimpse of the Rams' future, but until it's here, the young backs better get 
used to role-playing. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino gave a stirring demonstration of that. The second-year man from 
Missouri didn't waste a breath on the field, rushing four times for 48 yards. 
He also had a touchdown reception of seven yards, returned a kickoff 22 yards, 
threw the lead block on Ron Brown's 74-yard return and tackled Deion Sanders 
once as part of the kickoff return team. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said: "Bobby Delpino's effort in the game was a big thing for me, in 
terms of 'There's a man who understands the role that he has to play,' and he 
played it with brilliance." 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Green might want to take note. As long as Bell is running well, their 
chances will be few. But you never know when a guy's hamstrings will tighten. 
Gary, the rookie from Miami, got seven carries against the Falcons for 25 
yards; Green carried nine times for 36 yards. Soak it up while you can. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he isn't worried about having to spread the tailback job around 
right now because, well, Bell is swell and the others aren't quite ready to be 
impact players. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have too many good running backs," Robinson said. "I mean, we have 
some guys that are doing a good job, but most of those kids are just starting. 
Cleveland Gary is just a guy, he doesn't know half our offense, so he's just 
getting started. Gaston Green, out of the last eight games, he's missed four to 
injury, or not being ready. It's a nice collection of young backs, but I see 
them very much as learning people." 
</P>
<P>
The years ahead could be very different. Robinson is considering a change in 
offensive formations to accommodate his fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it forces some adjustments on our part in terms of our style of 
offense," he said. "We might want to see ourselves going back to a two-back -- 
not back, I've never been there -- but to a two-back offense, kind of like the 
(San Francisco) 49ers. Remember (Wendell) Tyler and (Roger) Craig? I think both 
had a thousand yards one year, or close. That's just speculation." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, it's take a number, wait your turn, and don't blow it when it 
comes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be nice if everybody got some action," Robinson said. "Is it 
important? Only if it helps us win." 
</P>
<P>
When you're 5-0, everything seems to break your way, even shoulders. Instead of 
facing quarterback Jim Kelly and the Buffalo Bills next Monday night, the Rams 
will get Frank Reich, who until Sunday's mop-up work hadn't thrown a 
regular-season pass since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, the AFC's top-rated passer, separated his left shoulder in the Bills' 
loss to Indianapolis. Reich put up some good numbers in relief, completing 11 
of 19 passes for 177 yards. Reich has thrown 39 passes in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The league's only unbeaten team is trying to keep its emotions under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're influenced much by the euphoria of what others may say 
about 5-0," Robinson said. "Within our own walls of our team, we're excited as 
hell about our team for our reasons. I think guys are excited that Bobby 
Delpino made that catch, and Ron Brown ran back a kickoff. Those things are 
becoming very exciting to us, but I don't think we are very interested right 
now in other people. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're interested in, 'How good are the (New York) Giants? The 
(Chicago) Bears?' We got a lot of guys who've never been to Chicago, and a 
whole bunch who've never been to Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Fred Strickland took another hit on his right knee Sunday, but a 
magnetic reasonance imaging test Monday proved negative. Strickland had 
arthroscopic surgery on the knee in August but the Rams are calling this injury 
"an irritation to the joint lining." They've listed Strickland as questionable 
for Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell's tight hamstring cost him the chance of returning to Buffalo as the 
National Football League's leading rusher. Bell started Sunday's game six yards 
ahead of Chicago's Neal Anderson but left the Atlanta game in the second 
quarter after gaining 62 yards in 10 carries. Anderson gained 86 yards against 
Tampa Bay and leads the league with 530, 28 more yards than Bell. Bell spent 
more than three seasons in Buffalo before being dealt to the Rams in 1987 as 
part of the Eric Dickerson deal. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the Rams rank third against the run and 27th against the pass. "It 
is the most deceiving statistic in football," John Robinson said of his team's 
pass defense numbers. "And the least important statistic. It does not equate to 
winning much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
HENRY ELLARD 
</P>
<P>
Single coverage by the Atlanta Falcons greeted the Rams wide Receiver and his 
passing partner, quarterback Jim Everett, Sunday, and 20 minutes later, the 
seven-year NFL veteran had 7 catches for 150 yards and his team had a 20-7 
halftime lead. At that point, Everett decided to spread the joy among five 
other receivers with Ellard enjoying a banner year in 1988, making 86 catces 
for 1,414 yards in 16 regular-season games. Yet, he's ahead of that pace so far 
this fall with 35 catches for 636 yards in 5 games.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MAKING MOST OF BEING STUCK IN THE MIDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Michelle Mauney prefers to be on the outside looking in. As it is, she's right 
in the middle of things. 
</P>
<P>
Mauney, a junior, is the middle blocker on the El Toro High School girls' 
volleyball team. But she prefers playing outside hitter, as she has done on 
club teams and in previous seasons at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Because she is 6-foot-2, she will likely play outside hitter at the college 
level. But because she is 6-2, she will likely remain a middle blocker in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be outside," she said. "It's kind of the glory position. But I 
don't mind playing middle blocker, especially if it's against an attacking 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
Mauney, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is not consumed with fame and glory. 
</P>
<P>
She is concerned, however, with getting enough attention from Division I 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
If Mauney continues to put up the numbers she did last week, she should have no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mauney had 18 kills and five blocks to lead El Toro to a 15-5, 
15-17, 15-9, 15-9 victory over Irvine. On Thursday, she had 16 kills and nine 
blocks to lead El Toro past Dana Hills, 15-6, 15-11, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone would have trouble matching those numbers throughout a season. Mauney 
was only averaging 4 1/2 kills per match before last week. 
</P>
<P>
"She might have had even more blocks than that, but (Irvine and Dana Hills) 
were both setting eight to 10 feet back from the net, virtually lobbing the 
ball over her," El Toro Coach Mike Jagd said. "That may just be coincidence, 
but Michelle is an excellent blocker." 
</P>
<P>
Because Mauney is a junior, she can expect her numbers to improve next year. 
Because El Toro has 10 juniors, two sophomores and only two seniors, she also 
can expect the same thing from the rest of her teammates, which should only 
help improve her numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about (this season being a learning one) since we are so young," she 
said, "but we've done so well, we're all focused on this year now." 
</P>
<P>
Mauney has led El Toro to a 7-2 start and a 2-0 record in South Coast League 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not what I would call a verbal leader," Jagd said. "But she definitely 
sets the tone. When she's on, we're on. 
</P>
<P>
"Her forte is blocking. She is a way-above-average athlete, but she is very 
thoughtful -- real analytical on the court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK ; 
</P>
<P>
SPELTZ ON PACE TO PASS RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
SLOW STARTS HAVEN'T SLOWED TITANS' QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Speltz started his first season at Cal State Fullerton with a bunch of 
fumbled snaps in a game played in the rain. He started his second by throwing 
nine interceptions in the first three games. 
</P>
<P>
And now, six games into his second and final season, he is on a pace to become 
the first Titan to pass for 3,000 yards, and to replace Damon Allen as the 
leading passer in Fullerton history. 
</P>
<P>
Speltz threw for a school-record 481 yards against Utah State, which wasn't 
enough for a Fullerton victory. All that yardage, and the Titans managed only 
three touchdowns and a field goal in a 34-23 loss. 
</P>
<P>
But the performance propelled Speltz into the top 10 in National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. statistics. He is fifth among Division I players in total 
offense with 284 yards a game and sixth in passing efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
And with 1,708 yards passing this season, he is on schedule to break Allen's 
season record of 2,469 yards, and his career mark of 4,218 yards. Speltz is 
currently second on the career list with 3,632. 
</P>
<P>
Speltz also seems certain to break the school record for completion percentage 
in a season, set by Ronnie Barber in 1987. Speltz is completing 70% of his 
passes, well above Barber's mark of 56%. 
</P>
<P>
The completion percentage and the yardage marks are both enhanced by the type 
of offense the Titans are running -- Speltz completes a lot of short passes 
that turn into long gains on the run. 
</P>
<P>
But records are records. 
</P>
<P>
More NCAA stats: Despite being held to 35 yards rushing Saturday, Mike Pringle 
still leads the nation in all-purpose running with a 222-yard average. Sheldon 
Canley of San Jose State (212) is second and Houston's Chuck Weatherspoon 
(197), formerly of La Habra High School, is third. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky Palamara, who became Fullerton's career leader in receptions (101) and 
yardage (1,594) Saturday, is third in the nation in receptions per game with an 
average of eight. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays Pacific at Stockton Saturday, facing a team that has discarded 
its wishbone offense under first-year Coach Walt Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy called the Tigers the best Pacific team he has seen in "four, five or 
six years." Pacific is 1-4 overall, 1-3 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
The basketball team will open preseason practice with a midnight madness 
session at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 15, the first minute teams can practice 
according to NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos, an All-Big West Conference forward last season, shooting guard 
Mark Hill and point guard Wayne Williams head the list of returning players 
from last season's 16-13 team that won five of six overtime games, including an 
upset of Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The volleyball team broke a 34-match Big West Conference losing streak last 
week with a victory over 18th-ranked San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Sabrina Dennis, a transfer from Golden West, had three aces, nine blocks and 11 
kills against San Diego State, starting a week in which she would have 33 kills 
in 65 attempts in three matches. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also was a milestone for first-year Coach Jim Huffman, whose team 
is 6-9 overall, 1-5 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays at UC Irvine tonight and travels to fourth-ranked Cal State 
Long Beach Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: OCEAN VIEW'S ROGERS PLAYS ALL OVER FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's rare not to see Sean Rogers on the field during Ocean View High School 
football games. More than a two-way player, Rogers virtually is an all-way 
player for the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Need a field goal? Rogers kicks. Need an interception? Rogers plays cornerback. 
Need a first down? He plays fullback, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate sitting on the sideline not playing," Rogers said. "I like to be out 
there all the time." 
</P>
<P>
To Tustin, it must have seemed as if Rogers was on the field all the time. 
Rogers, the Times' Athlete of the Week, kicked four field goals -- 27, 46, 32 
and 39 yards -- intercepted three passes and blocked an extra-point attempt in 
a 35-9 victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The four field goals were one short of the county single-game record set last 
season by El Modena's Tim Hatcher. Rogers had apparently tied the record with a 
34-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, but it was nullified when the 
Seahawks (3-2) accepted a penalty. Unaware that Rogers was one shy of the 
county record, Ocean View Coach Howard Isom sent in backup kicker Ron Lightner 
to kick a final field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize that until after the game," Isom said. "You're not thinking 
of records at those times. He had done an awful lot that night." 
</P>
<P>
That's nothing new for Rogers, a senior transfer from Douglas High in Box 
Elder, S.D. As a freshman, he played three games a week for Douglas, at three 
different levels. He was a quarterback for the freshman team; he was a 
quarterback and safety for the junior varsity, and he was a receiver for the 
varsity. 
</P>
<P>
South Dakota has no rules prohibiting such practices because schools often are 
wanting for players, Douglas Coach Dave Broadie said. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean View, football didn't start auspiciously for Rogers. First, he missed 
six weeks of football after breaking his hand in a non-football related 
accident in August. In his first full game, he missed four field goals in a 9-7 
loss to Western. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I did wrong," Rogers said. It's like hitting in baseball: If you 
don't watch the ball the whole time, you're not going to hit it." 
</P>
<P>
Even with some extra kicking practice last week, Rogers said he was nervous 
before the game. But his first successful kick changed that. 
</P>
<P>
"After I made the first one, I felt a little more confident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Tino Chavez of Mater Dei caught six passes for 163 yards and a touchdown in a 
19-14 victory over Huntington Beach Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Niednagel of Dana Hills defeated Mike Farrell of San Clemente Thursday 
in a cross-country race between two of the best runners in the county. 
Niednagel finished the three-mile race in 15 minutes 25 seconds, Farrell 
finished in 15:30. San Clemente won the South Coast League dual meet, 20-39. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Sherman of Edison rushed for 308 yards in 31 carries -- the 
seventh-highest rushing total in county history -- as the Chargers defeated St. 
John Bosco of Bellflower, 48-27, Friday. Sherman's total broke the school 
record of 238 yards set in 1979 by Kerwin Bell against Pius X. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Wilson, a Santa Ana defensive tackle, had three quarterback sacks and a 
deflected pass that was intercepted in the Saints' 17-14 victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Windle of Troy set a school single-game passing record with 268 yards in a 
33-21 victory over Savanna Friday. Windle, who completed 14 of 20 passes for 
two touchdowns, broke the record set in 1986 by Mike Pawlawski, who passed for 
230 yards against Sunny Hills.

HAWAIIAN AIR INVESTORS TELL FINANCE PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT GROUP'S STRATEGY INCLUDES SECURED BANK LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach investment group seeking to acquire Hawaiian Airlines plans 
to pay for the deal with a Security Pacific Bank loan secured largely by the 
assets of the airline and its parent, HAL Inc. of Honolulu, HAL Chairman Jack 
Magoon Jr. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although HAL leases most of its aircraft, it has a variety of real estate 
holdings in Hawaii, including a small airport in Maui's popular North Shore 
vacation area. 
</P>
<P>
The investor group, HAL Acquisition Inc., is headed by Newport Beach lawyer and 
longtime airline executive J. Thomas Talbot and former baseball commissioner 
Peter V. Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
The bank gave its tentative approval to the financing arrangement after all 
five of Hawaiian Airlines' unions -- which represent 83% of the carrier's 3,000 
employees -- approved a new five-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The unions agreed to accept a 36-month wage freeze for improved job security 
and a promise of raises in the final two years of the contract. The acquisition 
was contingent on the concessions by the unions. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific said its loan is dependant on changes being made to certain 
conditions of the acquisition deal worked out by HAL and the acquisition group. 
Magoon, who owns 56.9% of HAL Inc., said that the conditions imposed by 
Security Pacific do not appear to be major and that, from his perspective, the 
deal is moving along smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$22 a Share Offered 
</P>
<P>
The Talbot group has offered to pay $22 per share, or a minimum of $21.9 
million for 51% of HAL's common stock, to obtain control of the struggling 
airline. Talbot could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He said Wednesday that 68% of HAL's stock had been tendered to his group. 
Magoon said Monday that the total now is "a lot higher" but was unable to 
provide specific numbers. It would cost the Talbot group about $43 million to 
acquire all 1.9 million shares of HAL common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Magoon said directors were to decide Monday on a date in early November for a 
special shareholder meeting to vote on the airline's sale and on a date several 
days later "to close the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
The shareholder meeting tentatively had been scheduled for Oct. 23, but delays 
in submitting HAL's proxy statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
pushed things back about two weeks, Magoon said.

BRANFORD MARSALIS, THE ORIGINAL, SHOWS HIS STUFF AT THE COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Those of you who want to hear tunes from my last album should go home and play 
it," Branford Marsalis announced at the beginning of his show Saturday at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. "We're not going to play any of them." 
</P>
<P>
The mostly new originals that followed used the famous Miles Davis quintet of 
the mid-'60s as their touchstone, the songs showing the same involved style of 
composition and soloing that Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and 
Herbie Hancock brought to Davis' band on albums like "ESP" and "Miles Smiles." 
But where Miles moved on to electricity and funkified bass lines, Marsalis has 
headed out in an acoustic direction, extending Davis' cool posing with 
emotionally charged solos and heads-up rhythmic interplay. 
</P>
<P>
Though Marsalis' band (Kenny Kirkland, piano; Robert Hurst, bass, and Jeff 
(Tain) Watts on drums) used Miles as a structural reference point, its 
inspiration came from another '60s band: the John Coltrane quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this association is based on the drumming of Watts, whose circling 
onslaught recalled the polyrhythms laid down by Elvin Jones for the Coltrane 
band. Marsalis' deep, dark-roasted sound on tenor was similar to Coltrane's 
large, open tone and some of the late saxophone giant's abundant technique was 
also apparent. But where Coltrane would cut loose with screams, squawks and 
high-end antics to get his point across, Marsalis stuck to the middle register, 
delivering his story lines with all the smart timing of a good stand-up comic. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist announced the set's first three numbers then proceeded to work 
through them without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. J. C." featured a ringing solo from Kirkland while Watts leaned into his 
drum set to get the smoke going. Bassist Hurst used double stops and tight, 
playful pauses to get a rise out of the crowd, who seemed to appreciate his 
silences as much as what he plucked. 
</P>
<P>
After a big Coltrane-like ending with Watts crashing away on his cymbals, the 
group moved into Hurst's "Dark Night," a sultry theme that would make an 
appropriate sound track for a Raymond Chandler novel. Marsalis began at the 
tenor's bottom range, then worked his way up with rippling trills and quick, 
greasy lines before handing off to Kirkland who built his solo on a mountain of 
block chords. 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis' "Wrath of Tain," a vehicle for the group's drummer and the only 
previously recorded composition heard this night, gave Watts a chance to show 
his melodic approach to a drum solo. Much like Max Roach, Watts suggests a 
tune's theme and rhythms while building a solo that is rich with wit and the 
use of dynamics. Switching to soprano for the number, Marsalis showed a 
considered approach that avoided fireworks in favor of introspection. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist's reserved soprano style backfired on Kirkland's "Revelation," 
as his smooth flow seemed to lag at times, lacking direction and excitement. 
Kirkland came to the rescue, plugging the gaps with chordal echoes and 
embellishments that held the piece together. 
</P>
<P>
A Monkish number entitled "Spartacus" found Kirkland and Marsalis, still on 
soprano, stating the quirky theme in unison. The saxophonist seemed more at 
ease with the quicker tempo, dropping in a couple of lines from Monk's 
"Brilliant Corners" before turning the proceedings over to Watts and his 
rolling tom-tom attack. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst picked out a little Michael Jackson riff ("Bad") before the group moved 
into a Coltrane dedication called "Mr. Steepy." Marsalis wisely avoided any 
overt reference to the late saxophonist, which seems to bolster the contention 
that he's now developing his own direction. 
</P>
<P>
The territory he explored at the Coach House guarantees the journey will be an 
exciting one.

THEATER AND FILM / JAN HERMAN: 15-YEAR ODYSSEY BRINGS ACTOR DAREN KELLY FULL 
CIRCLE -- AND BACK TO ORANGE COUNTY ROOTS 
</P>

<P>
When Daren Kelly left Orange County to make a stage career in New York, South 
Coast Repertory co-founder Martin Benson was sorry to see him go. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a young leading man in the classic mold with a lot of talent," said 
Benson, who remembers the tall, dark-haired actor from SCR productions of 
Moliere's "Would-be Gentleman" and Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew." 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly, a Burbank native who grew up in Anaheim, had show-biz stars in his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like any kid's dream," he said last week, now 38 and just back from his 
15-year odyssey. "You take your little cardboard suitcase and you look up at 
the lights and say, 'I'm gonna get you, Broadway.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the time, in the early '70s, SCR was struggling for survival, unable to pay 
even its top actors a professional wage. Kelly, then just out of UC Irvine, was 
fortunate to get gas money. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like the only actors who worked regularly in all of Southern 
California came from out of town," he recalled. "Everybody talked about New 
York. It was the place to go." 
</P>
<P>
So Kelly headed east. In Chicago, he landed work in Molnar's trifle "The Play's 
the Thing," starring Tammy Grimes. "That's how I got my (Actors) Equity card," 
he said -- a card that might have had wings, the way it propelled him his final 
leg to Manhattan's theater district. But it couldn't get him work. 
</P>
<P>
Down to his last $82 as winter approached, he auditioned in every nook and 
cranny and waited for the phone to ring. One day it finally did. The producer 
of a bus-and-truck tour wanted to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into his office with the snow banked on my shoulders," Kelly recounted. 
"He said to me, 'How would you like to go to Florida in 'The Great Sebastian.' 
I said, 'Let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kelly returned to New York soon enough and, still starry-eyed, scored better 
than most. He was cast in Broadway's "Deathtrap" for a year, first opposite 
John Wood and then Stacy Keach and John Cullum. 
</P>
<P>
During eight of those 12 months, Kelly even managed to double as a regular on 
the daytime TV soap "General Hospital," a well-paid job that he kept for 
another two years. 
</P>
<P>
Then he landed on Broadway again at the Palace Theatre in "Woman of the Year," 
which starred Lauren Bacall. Six months later, Bacall left and was replaced by 
Raquel Welch. It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw plenty of people fairly high up in the business who couldn't do 
community theater," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, does he have any thoughts about the old storefront SCR on Newport 
Boulevard in Costa Mesa that he remembers? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, "actors like Don Took and Carl Reggiardo were giving 
world-class performances as good as anything I saw in New York. They just 
decided not to take on the whole planet." 
</P>
<P>
That said, Kelly had to be going. He had an appointment with a Los Angeles 
casting director. He's gonna get you, L.A. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY MONDAY: For a Monday night, customarily a day off in the theater, Eli 
Simon was a busy director. Probably the busiest in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The thin, dapper San Francisco native had to juggle two shows 20 miles apart -- 
one in Costa Mesa and one in Laguna Beach -- and both were premieres of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a staged reading of Anthony Clarvoe's "Pick Up Ax" on the 
Mainstage at SCR, which launched the theater's NewSCRipt series of 
plays-in-progress. The second was a variety show at the Laguna Hotel, 
inaugurating the UC Irvine Cabaret, a project co-directed by Dennis Castellano 
and designed to develop student talent in an off-campus setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got no complaints," said Simon, 31, who joined the UCI faculty last year 
as an assistant professor of theater and made an immediate splash directing a 
student production of Caryl Churchill's "Cloud Nine." 
</P>
<P>
Clarvoe's play takes place in Silicon Valley and focuses on two computer 
whizzes -- self-described "idiot savants" -- who start their own company and, 
when the competition gets tough, hire a business consultant who applies unique 
methods to keep from getting nosed out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has nothing but adoration for the script. "The writing is terrific," he 
said last week. "The dialogue is fantastic. The characters are deep and 
complex. The plot is gripping." 
</P>
<P>
SCR literary manager John Glore, who collaborated as the dramaturgist on "Pick 
Up Ax," agreed in a somewhat lower key: "Of all the plays we've presented in 
NewSCRipts, I'd say this is one of the ones closest to being ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, between the reading and the cabaret, Simon more or less covered as 
wide a theatrical spectrum as could be expected -- or, depending on one's 
enthusiasm, tolerated -- in a single night. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI Cabaret debut featured such acts as Paul Tifford, described by Simon as 
"a sure show-stopper." He is "the fifth-rated Hula-Hoop champion of the world," 
the director said, "straight out of Ed Sullivan." 
</P>
<P>
Other acts included a song-and-dance number by a former cheerleader for the 
Golden State Warriors, singers from a gospel choir and straight musical-theater 
excerpts from "Sophisticated Ladies," "Oklahoma!," "The Wiz" and "Cabaret." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be very eclectic the first time out," said Simon, adding that the 
next cabaret effort a few weeks down the line would be an all-Gershwin evening 
featuring "a very classy quartet."

MCI Communications Corp. filed suit today against American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co., claiming that AT&amp;T was trying to protect its eroding share 
of the long-distance market through maliciously false and deceptive 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court suit charges that beginning in January this year, 
AT&amp;T launched a counterattack against its competitors to regain market 
share and that in July it began targeting MCI's new Primetime cut-rate 
long-distance calling plan. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said AT&amp;T advertising "maliciously attacked MCI's honesty and the 
value of MCI's competing services by falsely and deceptively representing that 
AT&amp;T was superior to its competitors in general.

Lack of cash has shut down one of Los Angeles' three Spanish-language dailies, 
the newspaper's attorney said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper was undercapitalized, and they ran out of money," Jose Mariano 
Castillo said of El Diario de Los Angeles, which halted publication after 
Saturday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said El Diario's owner, Inmobiliaria America Latina Inc., hope to 
revive the newspaper, which was launched in May, 1987. "There is a hope that 
maybe in the future it will reappear," he said. "It's just a question of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
He said the newspaper had been losing approximately $80,000 a month. He said 24 
people lost their jobs when the newspaper ceased publication Saturday. Another 
26 had been laid off in June.

FLORIDA OPENS SESSION ON ABORTION;

SECURITY TIGHT, THOUSANDS RALLY OUTSIDE CAPITOL

Thousands of sign-waving, chanting demonstrators ringed Florida's Capitol today 
as the Legislature convened the nation's first special session on abortion 
since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers gaveled the session to order shortly after 1 p.m. to take up 
anti-abortion legislation pushed by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in the wake of 
a high court ruling giving states greater power to restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Just before lawmakers began the session, thousands of pro-choice activists 
marched through a light fog to the Capitol -- similar to a Monday night march 
by about 8,000 anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion demonstrators lined the route. No trouble was reported, although 
there was jeering and yelling from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, about 100 anti-abortion protesters gathered at a local cemetery to 
pray at a grave site where the remains of 782 aborted fetuses were buried last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Bob Crawford and House Speaker Tom Gustafson, both Democrats, 
said Martinez's proposals would get a full hearing in committees. But they said 
the legislation is unlikely to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe a session called to restrict abortion is a wise expenditure of 
time," Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the session would cost $40,000 a day and that he hopes to adjourn it 
Wednesday or Thursday, even though Martinez called for the session to run 
through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's anti-abortion movement suffered a setback last week when the state 
Supreme Court struck down a 1988 law that required girls under 18 to obtain the 
consent of a parent or a judge before getting an abortion. The court ruled the 
law violated a privacy clause in the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a bill yet that doesn't violate (the Florida Constitution's 
right to) privacy," said Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed officers maintained tight security at the Capitol, patrolling 
corridors and guarding the doors to the Senate and House chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"You are being heard on this issue," Martinez told a cheering crowd of 7,000 
anti-abortion activists in a rally outside the Capitol on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 1,000 babies could be saved by pending legislation, whose voices we 
won't hear, whose cries will not be acknowledged," Martinez said as the crowd 
chanted, "Pro-life! Pro-life!" 
</P>
<P>
Martinez called the session in July in response to the Supreme Court ruling in 
the Missouri case Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. The ruling prompted 
efforts in several states to impose limits on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the governor's proposals are a ban on the use of public money and 
facilities for abortions and expanded regulation of abortion clinics. Measures 
intended to make women think twice about having an abortion would require 
doctors to tell patients about the development of their fetuses and require 
women more than 20 weeks pregnant to be tested to see if the fetus could 
survive outside the womb before an abortion is performed.

Four Mexicans were found dead this morning in a railroad trailer pasted with 
warnings that it was being fumigated, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was not immediately known, but the victims, all men, had 
suffered diarrhea and vomiting, symptoms of poisoning from the fumigant 
commonly used on rail cars, said Sgt. John Burney. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern Pacific car inspector found the victims about 8:50 a.m. after a 
brakeman noticed that the door was open. The bodies were found in the back of a 
trailer riding piggy-back on a flatcar. 
</P>
<P>
A hole had been cut in the top of the trailer, apparently for ventilation, 
Burney said. The car was carrying tortilla flour.

Nathan, a popular broadcaster, was convicted of breaking a 1986 law barring

Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat in Tunis last year.

"They have clipped my wings only for a little while, but they know I'll be back

for the enemy to convince him that only dialogue can overcome the confrontation 
on the battlefield," the Iranian-born Nathan told the crowd.

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills got an early rebuff today when 
South Korea's agriculture minister rejected her demand that Seoul liberalize 
beef imports. 
</P>
<P>
As trade talks began, Kim Sik refused even to consider a full opening of South 
Korea's beef market for fear of its effect on domestic prices, Agriculture 
Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, starting three days of bilateral trade talks, threatened to retaliate in 
mid-November with duties on South Korean goods if the beef dispute is not 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is pressing Seoul to take a wide range of steps to reduce its huge 
trade surplus with the United States, which is trying to cut its massive trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Though disputes simmer in other areas, beef remains the most volatile trade 
issue between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Trade Minister Han Seung Soo, Hills demanded that 
Seoul crack down on illegal copying of textbooks and records as well as 
infringement of semiconductor patents.

layoffs and the closure of 65 dairy plants, did not disclose how much it will 
pay for FIAP. 
</P>
<P>
FIAP's estimated 1989 sales are about $90 million, compared with about $150 
million for Borden's existing European plastic films and packaging units. 
</P>

Borden, the nation's largest dairy company, also is a leading manufacturer of 
plastic food wraps used by institutions and restaurants.

BIG COMPUTER FIRMS GIRD FOR VIRUS ATTACK

Major computer companies said today that they are taking seriously the threat 
of a computer virus attack later this week and are advising employees to take 
precautions to protect their systems. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and International Business Machines have 
both issued internal memos warning staff about the impending virus, called 
Datacrime, which is expected to be activated Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A computer virus is a destructive program in a computer system that can damage 
or destroy data. It is called a virus because it acts like a biological virus 
-- it can travel from an "infected" disk or program and infect other computers. 
</P>
<P>
Computer industry experts say Datacrime is an especially dangerous virus that 
could infect older IBM personal computers and compatibles based on Intel 
Corp.'s 8086 chip. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very rare but very destructive," said Russell Brand, chief 
technical adviser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, 
Calif. Brand said his group has examined Datacrime in an infected computer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Kill Entire Disk 
</P>
<P>
Since networked computer systems are so widely used in major corporations, 
universities and by the government, a virus could disrupt thousands of 
machines. A virus also puts an organization at risk if its computer is 
penetrated by outsiders or exposed to programs of unknown origin. 
</P>
<P>
Brand said Datacrime is unique because it can wipe out a complete hard disk. 
"Most viruses, you can put the data back together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a hard disk drive, there is no way of getting to information on the 
disk, except to re-format that sector -- thus destroying all the files. 
</P>
<P>
At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, employees were warned not to use software from 
unknown sources and to back up data. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, which introduced an antiviral software product last week, said it is 
advising its employees to begin using its new software, and make copies of 
their data. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Already Infected 
</P>
<P>
IBM's product scans IBM compatible computer programs, looking for a change in 
programming patterns that may signify a computer virus. 
</P>
<P>
Datacrime, also dubbed the "Columbus Day" virus because of this week's Columbus 
Day holiday, has already infected a number of corporate systems and government 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
Experts do not know the source of Datacrime, except that it was first discussed 
publicly at a conference for computer hackers in Europe this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Brand and other experts said there are other computer viruses rumored among 
computer hackers -- one estimate is that about 77 different viruses are now in 
circulation.

Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said he doubts serious harm has been done 
to his company's public image since the Alaskan oil spill that has cost nearly 
$1.3 billion in cleanup bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we still have a good image around the world," Rawl said at a meeting 
in San Antonio of the Society of Petroleum Engineers late Monday. "People, 
especially along the Gulf Coast, realize that accidents can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Rawl said the company has spent $880 million of its own funds and $400 million 
from insurance companies on the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it (will cost) us any more, I don't know. I don't think so," Rawl 
said.

ARCTIC GOLF -- THE GREENS ARE WHITE

<P>
The greens are white and the balls are red, but the long winter of Lapland 
cannot stop golf at one of the world's most northerly courses. 
</P>
<P>
For three months a year, members of the Arctic Golf Finland Club brave the 
winter weather to play on a nine-hole course on a frozen river covered with 
three feet of snow. 
</P>
<P>
Snow actually starts falling in October, but Pentti Murtovaara, president of 
the club in the town of Ravaniemi, five miles south of the Arctic Circle, said 
it was too cold to play until February. 
</P>
<P>
"Before February it can be minus 30 degrees centigrade (minus 22 Fahrenheit), 
and if you hit a golf ball, it can crack," Murtovaara said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Kemijoki, Finland's biggest river, freezes with ice a yard thick, the 
150-member club is confined to just three holes and a practice range. 
</P>
<P>
"When it snows, we pack it down with one of those machines they use on downhill 
ski slopes," Murtovaara said. "We try to make the greens, or whites as we call 
them, as nice as possible with no snow lumps." 
</P>
<P>
The rough is just snow, the fairway resembles a flat ski slope while the whites 
are hard-packed snow swept smooth. 
</P>
<P>
The holes on the 1,564-yard, par-31 course are shorter than normal -- the 
longest is just 262 yards -- so players are restricted to using three irons and 
a putter. 
</P>
<P>
Balls lost in the soft snow off the fairway are a problem, and so is the 
bounce. If the ball hits ice, it bounces very high. When it lands on the packed 
snow, it bounces a little and then rolls. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball behaves rather as it would in the summer time," Murtovaara said. 
</P>
<P>
"We use red balls because it would be quite difficult to play with white ones," 
Murtovaara laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Club members dispense with a greenkeeper in the winter months and share the 
chores in keeping the course in shape. The reward of the communal effort is 
seen in the green (or white) fees. Club members pay annual dues of $140 while 
weekend guests are charged $9.50 a round. Midweek play is free. 
</P>
<P>
Murtovaara said Arctic golf was growing in popularity and could take off as a 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
A visitor from the United States brought his clubs earlier this winter. "He 
said it was just like normal golf," Murtovaara said.

HEAD INJURED, PREP FOOTBALL PLAYER WINS $11.2 MILLION

<P>
A former high school football player has been awarded $11.2 million from a jury 
that concluded a defective football helmet caused him to suffer a severe brain 
injury four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably dangerous, leading to 
acute bleeding within the brain of Richard Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County 
Circuit Court jury decided Monday in an 11-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The damage award is the largest in Multnomah County court history and 
apparently marks the first time that an injury case involving a Bike helmet has 
been presented to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors concluded that the Richard Austria,a reserve defensive back, was 2% at 
fault, thus reducing the total award of damages from $11.40 million to $11.19 
million. Bocci said Austria would need $5.2 million to provide for daily care 
the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irreversible Damage 
</P>
<P>
Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical impairments after 
suffering an acute subdural hematoma Oct. 1, 1985. He has been living with his 
parents but requires 24-hour care. 
</P>
<P>
William Mitchell, a Portland lawyer representing Bike, declined to comment on 
the outcome other than to say, "It was an emotional case." He said there is a 
strong chance of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bocci and James M. Pippin, representing the Austria and his parents, 
contended that the Bike Air Power model helmet worn by Austria had not been 
adequately tested before the company marketed it.

The Dallas Cowboys had an open "fire sale" on running back Herschel Walker 
today while NFL owners met several miles away trying to pick a new 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Agents Peter Johnson and Ralph Cindrich were considering a restructuring of 
Walker's $1-million-per-year contract as part of the price for his leaving the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball's in Herschel's court now," a Cowboys source said. "It's up to him to 
make a deal." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL trade deadline is next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Vikings have dangled two No. 1 draft picks, several other high 
picks and two starters as trade bait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to think of the Dallas Cowboys without Herschel Walker, but we 
can't close our eyes and ears to anything that might help the club," Coach 
Jimmy Jones said. "I'll be in touch with his agents today."

It was no ordinary first-round match for Natalia Zvereva. The 18-year-old from 
Minsk carried the hopes and dreams of a tennis-starved nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember being as nervous for a first-round match," Zvereva said today 
after beating compatriot Aida Khalatyan 6-3, 6-0 in the first professional 
tennis tournament in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I badly want to win here. The pressure is intense." 
</P>
<P>
Prolonged applause from a sparse first-day crowd of about 1,000 greeted the 
entrance of Zvereva onto the court at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva said she tried to treat it like any other match, but the occasion was 
too unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been told three years ago that in 1989 a professional tournament 
would be staged here, I'd have been shocked," Zvereva said. "It took me awhile 
to settle down. This was a wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva, last year's French Open finalist and ranked 14th in the world, said 
many of the other top players on the women's tour had expressed a desire to 
play here. 
</P>
<P>
"Martina (Navratilova) and Gabriela (Sabatini) both wished me luck and told me 
how much they would love to come," Zvereva said. "I'm sure this event can get 
even bigger. The public is hungry for tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Zvereva is in a dispute with the Soviet tennis federation over how much prize 
money she can keep. She declined to discuss the issue until the end of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In another first-round match, Jo-Anne Faull, the No. 8 seed from Australia, was 
upset 6-1, 6-4 by Sabine Hack of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere today, Johan Anderson of Australia upset seventh-seeded American 
Richard Matuszewski 6-2, 6-2 in a first-round match of the Australian Indoor 
tennis championships at Sydney.
