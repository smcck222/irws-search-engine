The government is probing an alleged plot by cocaine traffickers to assassinate 
President Jaime Paz Zamora, U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Gelbard and others, the 
head of Bolivia's special anti-drug force said. Retired Gen. Lucio Anez said he 
was also on the alleged death list, along with Interior Minister Guillermo 
Capobianco Ribera and other officials. Officials said the plot was hatched in 
Miami by former Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez, who was extradited to the 
United States on drug-trafficking charges in December.

At least 60 people burned to death when leftist radicals set fire to a train 
car in a protest that went awry near the south Indian city of Hyderabad, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Maoists poured kerosene on the floor of the car after boarding it to 
distribute leaflets supporting government plans to increase jobs reserved for 
lower-caste Hindus. The Maoists told the 120 to 150 passengers in the car to 
get out, set the kerosene on fire, then jumped off. Panic ensued when 
passengers were unable to open five of the six car doors, police quoted 
survivors as saying.

Rampaging youths torched a tobacco shop and a store in the shopping center of a 
low-income suburb of Lyon, France, in the fourth straight night of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The violence was far less severe than on the three previous nights, however, 
when hundreds of stone-throwing youths set fire to 20 buildings and burned two 
dozen cars. The rioting was triggered by the weekend death of Thomas Claudio, 
21, a passenger on a motorcycle that collided with a police patrol car. The 
rioters blame police for the death.

Officials said a fugitive embezzler hijacked a jetliner and caused its crash

</P>
<P>
Canton's aviation bureau and public security bureau identified the hijacker as 
Jiang Xiaofeng, 21, a purchasing agent for a county government office in 
Changsha. It said he was wanted by Chinese police for embezzling $3,600 in 
July. Jiang boarded a Boeing 737 in Xiamen and demanded to be taken to Taiwan, 
the officials said. Low on fuel, the plane landed instead in Canton, striking 
two planes on the ground.

FERRARO OPPOSES FARMERS MARKET PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT SAYS PLANNED 2-MILLION-SQUARE-FOOT SHOPPING 
CENTER ON THE SITE IS TOO LARGE AND SHOULD BE REDUCED TO 700,000 SQUARE FEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Responding to fears about increased traffic and other impacts on the quality of 
life in the Fairfax district, City Councilman John Ferraro called Tuesday for a 
drastic reduction in the size of a 2-million-square-foot shopping center 
proposed for the Los Angeles Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot support the project as presented," he said, revealing his position 
for the first time after years of discussions on the A.F. Gilmore Co.'s 
proposal to build three department stores, a hotel, offices and housing on a 
31-acre site at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a crowded hearing, Ferraro turned the microphone over to his 
planning aide, Rene Weitzer, who said "the proposed project . . . is simply too 
large. The public does not want to be burdened by another ugly closed mall." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Ferraro would agree to a 700,000-square-foot shopping center at the 
site, she said. It would be anchored by two department stores, including a May 
Co. that would move from its current location a few blocks away at Wilshire 
Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The current May Co. site has been proposed as the keystone of an office 
building and hotel project to be built by Forest City Development, which 
operates the nearby Park LaBrea apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Hilty, president of the A.F. Gilmore Co., which has owned the Farmers 
Market land for more than a century, said that it was too early to comment on 
Ferraro's vision for the site. 
</P>
<P>
It would be "a dramatic change from our program," Hilty said. "There's a lot of 
thinking that's got to go on. Real quick." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's plan would add less than 300,000 square feet of new retail space to 
the Fairfax district, Weitzer said, and the traffic effects would be "addressed 
relatively well" by wider streets, computerized signals and other changes to be 
paid for by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's long-awaited recommendations carry considerable weight because his 
district includes the Farmers Market, and because he serves as president of the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents an adjacent residential 
neighborhood, said Ferraro's ideas represented "a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
The project as proposed by the developer was "absurd," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, City Planning Department staff members recommended 
against any proposal for the site, saying that there are already four regional 
shopping centers within five miles of the Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
The project "will not preserve or enhance the residential character of the area 
. . . (which) cannot accommodate the traffic generated," said the report by 
city planning assistant Simon Pastucha. It quoted the results of an 
environmental impact report, which found that even with the installation of $21 
million worth of street improvements, traffic would be worse at seven 
intersections in the chronically congested area. 
</P>
<P>
The project would also be out of scale with the shops, small office buildings 
and single-family homes in the neighborhood, the planning staff said, and it 
would turn its back on the 56-year-old Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
If any project is built, planners said, they would recommend a variation 
including 729,250 square feet of office space and 600 residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzer, however, said that this, too, would "drastically change the character 
of this community." 
</P>
<P>
Hilty also ruled out an office development, saying that the Planning Department 
showed "a curious lack of understanding of our community." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last eight years, he said, as his family-owned firm has struggled to 
shape its proposal for the site, businessmen and residents alike have made it 
clear that offices should go on Wilshire Boulevard, and that housing would best 
be part of Park LaBrea's proposed expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up in the market and I love it," he said, pausing as his voice 
choked with emotion. "But I know it is not the unique attraction it was 20 or 
30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
"While we delight in hearing about people's fond memories of childhood trips to 
the market, many of those same folks are shopping some place else," Hilty said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gilmore Co. could have built "strip malls, fast-food drive-throughs and 
convenience stores" on the site, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was punctuated by frequent applause and some hissing as speakers 
made their points before hearing officers John Parker and Darryl L. Fisher, 
whose rulings on the proposed zone changes and tract map revisions are expected 
before Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farmers Market Development 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, a huge development has been envisioned for the corner of 3rd Street 
and Fairfax Avenue, provoking debate among residents and merchants over whether 
it would bring too muchtraffic.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY AGREES TO USE DEPUTIES IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to a contract under 
which sheriff's deputies will patrol the north end of Long Beach for the next 
nine months to support that city's undermanned Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
State statistics showed that Long Beach had the worst record of any major city 
in California in 1989 for solving serious and violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
City officials point to the department's inability to retain enough officers as 
a major reason for the ranking. The department has been plagued by labor 
turmoil, contributing to the turnover, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract with the county, Long Beach will pay nearly $4 million to 
have 11 sheriff's cars and a total of 46 deputies patrol the city's 5th and 9th 
council districts. A report from Sheriff Sherman Block said that he expects his 
office eventually to be asked to provide police service for the two districts 
into 1993.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN MCDONALD'S STANDOFF ORDERED TO 
TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who police mistakenly thought was holding hostages at a McDonald's in La 
Verne was ordered to stand trial Tuesday on robbery charges stemming from a 
holdup at a clothing store near the fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing, Pomona Municipal Court Judge Tom Peterson ruled 
there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Douglas E. Girard, 32, of San 
Jacinto, on three felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
Girard's arraignment was set for Oct. 23 in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Girard was arrested Sept. 24 after a seven-hour standoff in which police and 
sheriff's SWAT teams surrounded the restaurant in the belief that Girard was 
holding 20 people hostage. But after talking with the McDonald's customers, 
prosecutors decided that Girard never brandished his gun nor made any threats 
and was only trying to blend in with the customers to avoid detection by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they linked Girard to a $200 holdup at a Kids Mart store across the 
street from the McDonald's and an earlier $50 robbery at a Claremont florist 
shop.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER IN LYNWOOD CASE ACCUSES BLOCK OF 
SLANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer who filed a federal class-action lawsuit charging Lynwood deputies 
with racially motivated brutality demanded Tuesday that Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block and one of his captains retract statements about the case 
that he alleges were "bald-faced lies." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney George Denny III filed an administrative claim with the county Board 
of Supervisors against the county, Block and and Sheriff's Capt. Doug McClure 
alleging personal injuries -- slander and defamation of character -- as a 
result of statements the two lawmen allegedly made to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
Denny is the lead attorney in a lawsuit filed in September in which 70 
plaintiffs allege that the Sheriff's Department engaged in a wave of wanton 
shootings, beatings and excessive force while working out of the Lynwood 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Denny alleges that Block said during 
</P>
<P>
a news conference last month that only a single citizen's complaint had been 
filed with the Sheriff's Department. However, Denny said that on April 30 he 
sent the sheriff a six-page letter outlining problems at the Lynwood substation 
and making complaints on behalf of six named and six unnamed people who appear 
as plaintiffs. In a news conference Tuesday, Denny distributed copies of a May 
23 letter from Block acknowledging receipt of the lawyer's correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
Denny is also demanding that similar remarks made by McClure on a radio talk 
show be retracted. He said that if retractions are made, he will drop the 
county administrative claim. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman said the department will issue a statement later this 
week. CAROL McGRAW

REFUGEES CLAIM MISTREATMENT BY INS GUARDS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE REPORTS OF BEATINGS. OFFICIALS WILL TURN OVER 
COMPLAINTS TO AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fifteen Latin American refugees filed claims against the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service on Tuesday, alleging that they were beaten, kicked and 
mistreated by their federal guards. 
</P>
<P>
The claims, filed as a necessary step before a federal lawsuit, seek $15 
million in damages. Most of the alleged abuses occurred at detention centers in 
El Centro and Imperial and involved 10 INS guards. Two minors are among the 
aliens making the claims. 
</P>
<P>
Peter A. Schey, attorney for the 15 alleged victims and executive director of 
Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said his 
clients' testimony reveals a "persistent pattern of brutality and abuse" by INS 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of finding safe haven here, they (the aliens) have been met by a U.S. 
government . . . that violated their physical integrity and mental well-being," 
Schey said at a news conference. "We cannot tolerate government employees 
treating refugee detainees as if they are worse than prisoners of war." 
</P>
<P>
INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said the allegations would be turned over for 
investigation to the Office of the Inspector General, a Justice Department 
agency that is independent of the INS. She declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
In written statements and in interviews, the 15 aliens said they were beaten 
and kicked by INS agents, denied adequate medical care, handcuffed or shackled 
arbitrarily and frequently placed in an isolation cell, known as el hoyo (the 
pit), for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran William Garcia Ramos was 16 when he was picked up by INS agents on 
June 4 after crossing the border illegally into Arizona. He said he had fled 
his home of Sesuntepeque because of fears he would be forced to fight in the 
Salvadoran civil war and because his family was too poor to support him. 
</P>
<P>
Held at the detention facility for minors in Imperial, Garcia said INS agents 
accused him of planning an escape, threw him against a wall several times 
during questioning, and slapped his face. 
</P>
<P>
"I said nothing because I didn't know what they were talking about," Garcia 
said, adding that he was threatened with more severe beatings if he did not 
apologize to his guards. Eventually, he said he was placed in solitary 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
Moris Anibal Gonzalez Centeno, a 20-year-old Salvadoran, was detained in May 
and sent to the INS facility in El Centro, where he claims he was repeatedly 
shoved and hit in the ribs, shoulder and mouth by an INS agent. The alleged 
treatment left his face bloody and his arms immobile, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many like me who are mistreated but they say nothing out of fear" of 
reprisals from guards, Gonzalez Centeno said. 
</P>
<P>
In another claim, Rigoberto Cabezas, a Nicaraguan who is being held at the El 
Centro facility pending deportation, said he was beaten after he spoke to an 
immigrants rights attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The officer that beat him, Cabezas said, locked him in a bathroom and then 
approached him wearing surgical gloves. He accused Cabezas of being a 
"troublemaker" and then punched him several times in the stomach, Cabezas said 
in a written declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"He then threw me against the shower wall," Cabezas stated. "He proceeded to 
punch me again in my right ribs and tried to provoke me with 'Come on . . . hit 
me.' I believed (the officer) was punching me in soft spots so as to not leave 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
"He continued to punch me several times more when I suddenly slipped on some 
water on the floor. He left me on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The government has six months to investigate the claims filed Tuesday. If the 
response is unsatisfactory, Schey said, the 15 aliens will file a lawsuit. Of 
the 15 aliens, one-third are in detention, several have been deported, and the 
others posted bond and have been released to await the outcome of their asylum 
petitions, Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
Activists who work with refugees have been trying for months to build legal 
cases around alleged mistreatment of detained foreigners by the INS. They 
especially are trying to focus on the plight of unaccompanied minors who are 
crossing illegally into the United States in ever-growing numbers and often 
ending up in detention. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials in the past have denied that minors are handcuffed on a regular 
basis and have said that discipline involved being confined to their rooms. 
Robert Mandgie, assistant district director for detention and deportation, said 
in an interview earlier this year that some of the minors do present discipline 
problems.

FAULTY WHEELS SUSPECTED IN DERAILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The derailment of a Los Angeles-bound freight train that crashed into a Mt. 
Washington apartment building may have been caused by faulty wheels on a 
boxcar, state officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined that the derailment occurred when a section of track 
bent under the weight of a passing freight car, said Ed Damrom of the Public 
Utilities Commission's Railroad Operations and Safety Section. 
</P>
<P>
Damrom said investigators were trying to determine why the rail, which was in 
good condition before the accident, bent and triggered the derailment. He said 
the most plausible theory was that the wheels, or "trucks," of one boxcar may 
have been defective and caused the boxcar's load to shift while the car 
negotiated a curve. 
</P>
<P>
Eight families were temporarily left homeless by the Monday morning derailment. 
After Santa Fe Railroad crews removed the demolished boxcars, city officials 
allowed residents to return to all but two units in the 11-unit apartment 
building Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers laid 2,500 feet of new track to replace that damaged in the 
accident. The rail line, which serves freight and passenger traffic, was 
expected to be reopened by early today after several hours of testing, said 
Dave Mansheim, assistant superintendent with the railroad. Residents of the 
damaged apartment building in the 4600 block of North Figueroa Street were not 
pleased to hear news of the rail line's reopening. Some said that the accident 
-- which crushed several cars in the apartment building's parking lot -- had 
left them traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
Rocio Peralta, 20, said that after the accident she spent a restless night 
tossing and turning on a cot at a nearby Red Cross evacuation shelter. Her 
apartment was one of those most seriously damaged by the derailment. 
</P>
<P>
She fell asleep just long enough to have a brief nightmare in which she 
struggled to save her 2 1/2-year-old son, Enrique, from crashing boxcars. 
</P>
<P>
"I could feel the train, I could see the train coming," Peralta said in 
Spanish. "I reached for my son, to save him. And then my husband woke me up." 
</P>
<P>
Enrique, she said, would wave to the passing trains each morning while standing 
on the apartment steps, which were crushed in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the derailment, Peralta said, Enrique slept late because a 
neighbor's party had kept the family awake all night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle that my son wasn't there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators determined Tuesday that the derailment occurred after a rail bent 
and "flipped over" under the weight of a boxcar carrying two metal containers, 
one stacked on top of the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Double stacking" is common on freight cars but, in Monday's accident, the load 
may have become unevenly distributed because of a faulty suspension system in 
the wheelbase, Damrom said. This would have caused the boxcar to bend the rail 
as it negotiated the curve. 
</P>
<P>
After the rail curved, the double-stacked boxcar rode for several hundred feet 
along the inner edge of the track. It was the first car in the 53-car train to 
derail, Damrom said. Eleven other cars also left the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Damrom added that Santa Fe officials inspect the track three times a week. It 
had last been inspected Friday and was in good condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they determined that the train was traveling 18 m.p.h. at 
the time of the accident, below the 25 m.p.h. speed limit established for 
freight trains on the curving track.

SUSPECT IN 'MESSENGER OF THE LORD' RAPES PLEADS NOT GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN DOHERTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old graduate student pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 18 charges of 
sexual assault, robbery and kidnaping in the so-called "Messenger of the Lord" 
attacks on four women in Long Beach and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, however, the attorney for Joseph Brian Socha told reporters that 
the accused rapist had "made a statement admitting his involvement with these 
crimes" to police. 
</P>
<P>
Socha, who is being held without bail at the Los Angeles County Jail hospital, 
should be released on bail, Deputy Public Defender Carl Kandel said during his 
client's arraignment in Long Beach Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kandel complained that Socha has been "chained up to his bed" and unable to 
take a shower. Authorities said he had been under a suicide watch. 
</P>
<P>
Socha is under medication for depression, Kandel said, and his condition has 
been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia. The attorney predicted that Socha's 
mental state will be a key element in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Bradford Andrews ordered that the bail request be reviewed on Oct. 17, 
when Socha will appear for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Socha was arrested last week in a rented room in a Rancho Palos Verdes home in 
connection with a string of sexual attacks that occurred in the last three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Four women were coaxed at dusk into a tan-colored Volvo by a man who then 
sexually assaulted them, police said. In at least two cases, the assailant 
called himself "St. Peter," cut off the victims' hair and carved upside-down 
crosses in their backs. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, Kandel characterized the crosses as only "scratches" and 
insisted that his client meant no harm. "It's the type of thing a person would 
do to carry out a godly plan. 
</P>
<P>
"He was driven by the fact he wants (the women) to stop being prostitutes 
rather than wanting to do them injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said that at least two of Socha's alleged victims were either 
hitchhiking or walking alone because of car problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kandel told reporters that Socha said he had suffered a head injury while 
serving in the U.S. Marine Corps as a drill sergeant in San Diego. The injury, 
according to Kandel, may have led to "mental problems" and the "hearing of 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
According to academic records, Socha graduated in 1987 from San Diego State 
University. The following year, he enrolled in a master's of business 
administration program at Cal State Dominguez Hills. He was scheduled to 
graduate this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Socha also worked as a temporary clerk with an automotive parts supply center 
in Los Angeles and was a member of a San Pedro singles congregation of the 
Church of Latter-day Saints.

<P>
FOR CRENSHAW CENTENARIAN, GOLD LICENSE IS A MILESTONE ON THE ROAD OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many Angelenos, Cornelious Alphonso Murdock considers driving a metaphor 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock's road, however, has been longer than most. At 100 years old, he's 
still driving. 
</P>
<P>
On his birthday Tuesday, friends and officials of the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles gathered at Murdock's Crenshaw district home to wish the retired 
postal worker well as he rounded the century mark. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Murdock -- who wears glasses only for reading and has just recently 
began considering using a hearing aid -- took the written test to renew his 
right to navigate on the state's byways. He scored 95%. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock drives infrequently now, sticking mainly to short jaunts through his 
neighborhood in a 10-year-old sedan. 
</P>
<P>
At the birthday party, the DMV officials promised Murdock a "gold" driver's 
license -- which differs from a regular license only in that it is issued to a 
centenarian. Murdock's is the second to be presented in California. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock said he started driving in Los Angeles when he was 23. He first drove a 
Ford truck on his job as a parcel post delivery man. Then there was an 
eight-cylinder Mitchell, a Hudson, a Buick and some Chryslers. 
</P>
<P>
He also remembers, with particular fondness, a "GM Regal underslung," circa 
1915. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my pleasure car," Murdock said. "The springs were underneath; it made 
the car ride very low. It was pretty popular at the time." 
</P>
<P>
From a motorist's vantage point, Murdock measured the changes in the city, its 
roads and its people. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to go on Sunday drives for the fun of it," he said. "We used to enjoy 
life. Now Los Angeles is a madhouse. People have very little respect for one 
another. Cutting in and out of traffic, everybody seems to be in a hurry. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's not much of a pleasure going out for a drive any more. You use driving 
now as a means of getting from one place to another. And when you get back 
home, you just have to be thankful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Murdock added that, through it all, he has done a good job of avoiding 
life's SigAlerts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been driving since 1913 and I haven't had an accident yet," he said. "I 
don't really have a secret for it. Maybe it's because I have a sense of 
anticipation. I sort of know what the other fellow is going do, and I can avoid 
mixing it up with him." 
</P>
<P>
He has made some compensations for his age. Just last year, for instance, he 
gave up driving on weekends to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I take the bus," Murdock said.

PROPOSITIONS FOR TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In arguing against term limitations, Polsby states that "term limitations throw 
away the benefits of learning from experience." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly! What poor Polsby doesn't seem to understand is that this is the very 
reason we want to limit terms of our elected representatives. And what are the 
major things our representatives learn from experience? How to get reelected by 
getting money from powerful special interests, how to build up their personal 
power bases at public expense, how to use their offices for personal gain, etc.

TAX BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good news. The commentary by Stephen Moore ("A Potential Windfall Waits Outside 
the Golden Door," Sept. 28) relates that almost two-thirds of all immigrants 
are between the ages of 16 and 45 and create a net windfall to the government 
in taxes paid. 
</P>
<P>
Bad news. The other one-third of immigrants may create a bottomless pit in 
their consumption of free health care, welfare, food stamps, public housing, 
social, legal and penal services, education and other subsidized services. 
</P>
<P>
Hold off any more legislation on immigration until the true social cost of the 
10 million legal immigrants and more than 20 million illegal aliens who entered 
the United States in the 1980s is known.

TAX BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sure seems like it's going to be easy to balance the federal budget. If 
Moore's assumptions are correct (which is almost a certainty given his 
pre-eminent position at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution and Hudson 
Institute), we could simply allow say 50 million people to immigrate to the 
United States each year for the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wow, just think what 2.5 billion consumer-taxpayers would contribute to the 
national economy over their lifetime! The thought alone is enough to trigger 
the salivation reflex in the most dispassionate chamber-of-commerce-types among 
us. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so there are going to be some naysayers, illiterate in the ways of 
contemporary economics, who will argue that the addition of so many people to 
our nation over such a short period of time will seriously erode the quality of 
life for the 250 million-plus that are already here. Can you believe the 
temerity of those who would embrace such heresy? Besides, there is no way that 
Moore would have excluded a quality-of-life variable from his brilliantly 
incisive "balance the budget" algorithm. 
</P>
<P>
Or would he? Even if he did, as anyone residing in Southern California somewhat 
continuously for the past decade knows, millions of newcomers can easily be 
assimilated into a relatively small geographical region with minimal impact on 
its social fabric. Indeed, it should be apparent to all living in this area 
that our lives have been immeasurably enriched with better schools, less 
crowded freeways, cleaner air, quieter, less violent neighborhoods and a 
dramatic reduction in sociopathic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope that Moore's vision of America becomes reality. And to hell with 
the spotted owl.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS K. BAKER, Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers 
University, is the author of House and Senate (W.W. Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a recurring temptation in American politics to wreak vengeance on 
one's adversaries by overhauling the political institutions that they dominate. 
What usually results from this ill-considered radical surgery is that the very 
people who scheduled the operations end up in the recovery room. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin D. Roosevelt's plan to expand the Supreme Court in 1937 to dilute the 
votes of conservatives resulted in the creation of an opposing political 
coalition that lived on after the controversy to plague every subsequent 
Democratic President. The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would 
never be another F.D.R., so they pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting 
presidents to two terms. The first President to come under the restriction was 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican who might very well have won a third term. 
</P>
<P>
The latest institutional patients to be wheeled into the shock-trauma unit are 
the state legislatures. The quack therapy being performed on them is the 
imposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve. The 
first cut took place on Sept. 18, when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly 
a ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years' service. 
</P>
<P>
By itself, the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act 
of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar 
measures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Eager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year, some 
journalists have seen in the Oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents, a 
manifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the Democrats, the 
party that holds the largest number of legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma referendum is none of these. It is, rather, the kind of minor 
political tempest that gets highlighted briefly by the media, is copied in a 
few places and then disappears. It is Republicans, naturally enough, who seem 
to be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation, since they have the 
most to gain, at least in the short term, from an indiscriminate clean-out of 
the nation's deliberative bodies. 
</P>
<P>
What makes term limitation such a singularly inappropriate tool is the almost 
total lack of connection between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the 
discipline proposed. The very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that 
have often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of 
lawmakers -- the quality that term-limitation backers now assert as a virtue. 
</P>
<P>
Where state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet 
rarely, they usually come under the sway of full-time governors, 
executive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists. Indeed, the goal of 
legislative reformers for the past 50 years has been more professionalism in 
the state assemblies, not less. 
</P>
<P>
By turning out the legislators every 12 years -- or even worse, every six years 
-- you pretty much guarantee that those who are elected won't have much of a 
stake in their jobs. They will use them as temporary hitching posts on their 
way to other offices without term limitations. Not every state lawmaker has his 
eye on a seat in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives. But it's a safe 
bet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if 
they know that the law will force them out soon. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists, of course, will rejoice. Their influence over these legislative 
birds of passage will grow because they will be guaranteed a perennial crop of 
callow and ignorant lawmakers. One thing that legislators now have going for 
them is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if 
they care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating, along with the lobbyists, will be the legislative staffs whose 
tenure would be unaffected. These unelected officials are permanent and beyond 
the reach of voters, while the very people who are in some measure accountable 
will be hustled out of office. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, what the term limit amounts to is an indictment of citizenship. It 
is an admission that the voters are civic imbeciles who cannot discriminate 
between bad lawmakers and good ones. Where surgical strikes are needed to 
eliminate the incompetent or corrupt, the term limitation uses carpet bombing 
in the hope that in the resulting carnage, some of the guilty will suffer along 
with the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
At the most basic level, term limitation is just flat-out wrongheaded and 
illogical: To throw everybody out when all you want to do is throw out the 
rascals is like burning down your house in order to get rid of the rats.

PRIVATE FACES, PUBLIC PLACES;

<P>
FOR VETERANS WITH AIDS, A WAR TO THE END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cafeteria of the Veterans' Hospital in West Los Angeles is a slow and heavy 
place. Men wait here with neither patience nor impatience, as if waiting were 
itself a state of being. Once, long ago, they had firm muscles and quick 
salutes; they were soldiers of clear outline and precise energy. They were 
military men, the golden gods of time past. 
</P>
<P>
Into this room of bulbous jowls and defeated paunches intrudes a moment of 
electrifying alarm. A wheelchair appears at the door and in it is a skeletal 
man, pushed by another hardly more substantial. Their fiery hollowed faces 
stand out. About them is the incandescent look of those who struggle with 
death, the ultimate unarmed combat. They are vets; they are men with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On the walls of the Immunodeficiency Unit, someone has taken care to hang 
pictures full of sunlight and life: a Monet of lovers dancing or stealing away. 
The paint has been refreshed, the bedside night tables are new -- and no one 
uses this unit as a shortcut. It is a place of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Meheny, head nurse, brisk and clean, looks like Richard Dreyfuss a 
little, or a jovial Lenin. Here is what he hates: people who are afraid of AIDS 
patients, people who complain about aches and pains, banker friends who moan 
about the horrors of their job, doctors who ask for masks and gloves for 
cursory examinations, outsiders who hear the word AIDS and see the specter of 
the grave. 
</P>
<P>
"We laugh a lot in this ward. We make fun of things here, we get our patients 
to laugh. Maybe they're going to die in 24 hours, but maybe they'll last for 10 
years. They come in here damn near dead but we bring them around. There are 
miracles here and I love this job, it's the best job I've ever had. It's done a 
lot of neat things for me." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 nurses and three aides are volunteers. "We're not a fashionable crowd 
here." John, with his clear untroubled face and blue eyes, looks too young to 
be married, to have one child and another on the way. "My wife backed me all 
the way on this. We just try to make life 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, kind and cheerful, has a face that quickens with energy. "One 
gentleman suddenly said, 'Beverly, sit me up in bed, please.' He wanted to 
clean his teeth, then he called his friends to say 'thank you.' And he died." 
</P>
<P>
Generosity has many springs. Brian Meheny's mother had TB once and spent two 
years in a sanitarium. Hers was a cold and tired life: She had six children 
over 37 years of marriage. Her husband was a hard and bitter man who fought 
against his children's dreams of college. "He didn't believe in it." Meheny has 
known more laughter here than in that childhood home in Utica, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The patients gather at times in the common room: Llewellyn, Harley, Mark, one 
half-paralyzed by a disease picked up from his cats, which must now be put to 
sleep, another wracked with infection and with missing friends who have left 
him. They die, they go back into the world. The world, of course, is afraid of 
them, and the irony is that it is they who must fear the world. Every germ, 
every careless moment of sickness brushed up against brings closer the final 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
It seems incongruous to find here a ring commemorating Da Nang, Marine Corps' 
service in Vietnam, to hear military reminiscences. "Oh, it was a romantic 
endeavor going into the Army, playing soldier. The uniform, the beautiful 
uniform, the time the general sat at the lunch table with me and my little 
friends. . . . " They loved the Army. They were boys from small towns in 
America, from homes of tiny dreams, who went out into strange places, running, 
sweating, puffing, being healthy enough to fight and to die. 
</P>
<P>
Some fight here to the end; others give up. Brian Meheny has comforted men in 
the long, dark nights, held them close in their passing: "I'm not afraid to 
die. I want to live longer. But through the years I have watched doctors 
pounding on chests, trying to save people who should have been left alone with 
their family holding their hands. I want to be in a room with friends, candles, 
music -- love me, and let me go." 
</P>
<P>
A soldier's courage takes many forms.

Roman Catholic church leaders announced the "sad decision" to tear down two 
19th-Century churches damaged in the 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake nearly a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop John S. Cummins of the Catholic Diocese of Oakland told a news 
conference that St. Francis de Sales Cathedral and Sacred Heart Church will be 
razed. He said the church cannot afford the $8 million it would cost to fix 
them. St. Francis, near downtown, was built in 1893. Sacred Heart, in north 
Oakland, was built in 1897.

JOB PICTURE STILL UNSETTLED AS FEDERAL WORKERS RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Excuse Sandy Denny, the office supervisor at the Social Security Administration 
office in Huntington Beach, if she yawned at work Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She had stayed up late Monday night to watch a broadcast about the fate of the 
federal budget -- and the fate of her job. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, President Bush and Congress agreed on a temporary funding 
bill early Tuesday to end a three-day federal government shutdown. And people 
like Denny trickled into work a few hours later with a mixture of joy, 
irritation and relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unsettling," Denny said. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not necessarily the end. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary spending measure gives congressional leaders until Oct. 19 to 
complete work on a $500-billion budget package. Another stalemate could develop 
in 10 days. Tense negotiations over specific tax increases and spending cuts 
are expected, with lobbyists clamoring for special treatment by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all frustrated, not knowing day to day if we report to work or not," 
said Larry Boland, district manager of the Social Security offices in Ventura 
and Oxnard, who until the last-minute budget reprieve was planning to report to 
work Tuesday just long enough to dismiss his entire staff. 
</P>
<P>
William V. Evans, an Internal Revenue Service auditor in the Federal Building 
in Los Angeles and vice president of a chapter of the National Treasury 
Employees Union, was more cynical. 
</P>
<P>
"All along I've felt this (threatened shutdown) was just a tactic to try and 
get something done on the budget," said Evans, 56, who has worked for the IRS 
for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
The consternation of federal workers was rooted not only in the machinations of 
Congress but in years of frustration over wages that they believe are too low. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, because of budget cuts, federal salaries have fallen about 
30% behind private-sector pay. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements appeared possible in congressional budget hearings last month. The 
Senate approved an amendment authorizing a $5-billion program to raise federal 
pay by linking most government salaries to comparable jobs in local markets -- 
the first time such regional adjustments had been introduced to the federal pay 
system. 
</P>
<P>
John N. Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American Federation of 
Government Employees, called Tuesday for a rally in front of the White House on 
Thursday to urge Bush and Congress "to build a consensus . . . and ensure that 
this (shutdown) is never repeated." 
</P>
<P>
"We must stop the use of federal workers as pawns in this never-ending game of 
political chess and come up with a compromise package that does not once again 
unfairly place the burden of this country's financial woes on federal workers 
and retirees," Sturdivant said. 
</P>
<P>
Government workers first began to feel anxious in August when various 
departments notified some employees of potential furloughs if the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law took effect. As the new fiscal year 
approached on Oct. 1 without a budget, talk turned to the possibility of a 
complete shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
National parks and federal monuments were closed over the Columbus Day weekend 
after Congress failed to pass a bipartisan budget compromise and Bush vetoed a 
stopgap spending bill, leaving the government without legal authority to spend 
any money. 
</P>
<P>
Most federal workers had been told to report to work as usual on Tuesday, all 
the while aware that "non-essential" workers ranging from IRS auditors to meat 
inspectors would be sent home if no budget compromise had been reached 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's childish to have to go through this every year," said Ed Ramirez, a 
Huntington Beach Social Security claims representative, who said he would have 
been forced to get part-time work if budget cuts had been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Like other federal workers interviewed Tuesday, Ramirez said he is reluctant to 
make plans unless a budget is made final before Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope to God that we're not in the same position on the 19th and we 
don't have to go through this nonsense again, he said." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bonnie Brown, regional director of a small union that represents workers 
at two Navy bases near Oxnard: "The way I look at it, members of Congress are 
the only non-essential workers." 
</P>
<P>
Baker reported from Los Angeles, Efron from Orange County. Kenneth R. Weiss and 
Joanna M. Miller also contributed from Ventura.

JACK SMITH: IT'LL ONLY HAPPEN OVER YOUR DEAD BODY? FINE; SIGN HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A story in the paper the other day by Carol McGraw began as follows: 
</P>
<P>
"A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has given renewed life to a group that 
freezes the dead in hopes they may be revived someday." 
</P>
<P>
An exemplary lead: brief, informative, and with a nice touch of irony. 
</P>
<P>
The story went on to describe the legal situation as it stands; but 
understandably it left the philosophical implications open to individual 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
To recapitulate, the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, of Riverside, had sued to 
force the state Department of Health Services to issue death certificates and 
body disposal permits for those who want their bodies frozen after death. Judge 
Aurelio Munoz ruled that it is illegal for the state to deny such services. The 
state must either appeal or comply. 
</P>
<P>
While the legal contest remains undecided, surely the case will cause much 
speculation on the wisdom of cyronics, as the practice of freezing the dead for 
future resuscitation is called. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem a morbid subject, but on the other hand the prospect of a return to 
life must bring joy, at first glance, to the human heart. Who would not like, 
after death, to be restored to life in a better world of scientific wonders, 
one of which would be the final defeat of disease. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose one dies of cancer. His body is frozen, and 20 or 50 or 100 years 
later, when science has eliminated cancer, one is brought back to healthy life. 
The same would apply to emphysema, AIDS, Parkinson's disease or any other fatal 
ailment. As each was conquered in the laboratory, its victims would be thawed 
out and restored to life. 
</P>
<P>
It does sound far out; but even cyronics critics concede that technology may 
some day be able to accomplish it. But, they say, today's technology cannot 
prepare the bodies for future revival. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the feasibility of cyronics, one must decide whether one wants to give 
it a try. I doubt that bodies could be frozen without their owners' consent. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the advantages are obvious. One would have a second chance in a sound 
body. One could eat, drink and be merry once again. I assume, though, that 
rejuvenation is not part of the package. If one died at 70, one would be 
revived at 70. So, unless the frailties of old age had also been eliminated, 
one's activities and one's future might be limited. 
</P>
<P>
But I foresee more troubling complications. What if a man died at 40, for 
example, leaving a lusty wife behind, and were revived 10 years later, only to 
find her remarried. This idea has often been treated humorously in the movies, 
but the returning husband is usually a ghost, not flesh and blood. I doubt that 
it would be humorous in real life. 
</P>
<P>
Someone like Judge Munoz would undoubtedly be called on to rule whether a woman 
whose husband had been frozen could legally remarry; or whether a frozen 
husband, on being thawed, could demand his wife back. However the court might 
rule, I do not see an amicable solution to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Alcor charges $100,000 to freeze a body, a sum that is usually paid out 
of the deceased's insurance money, which he has previously signed over to the 
cyronics company. To conjure up the lusty wife again, one wonders how she might 
like being deprived of $100,000 in insurance money just so her dead husband can 
be turned into an iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is unfair to refer to the wife as lusty. Any wife, I should think, 
however modest, might resent being prevented from making another marital 
alliance while her husband is frozen -- perhaps for decades. She would doubly 
resent it, I suspect, if he had signed away his insurance money to pay for his 
refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
There is a cheaper way to go, according to McGraw's story. One may elect to 
have only his head frozen. This truncated process costs only $30,000. However, 
the candidate must wait for a technology that could not only restore life but 
also recreate his discarded body. By the time that breakthrough occurs, the 
chap's wife would long since be dead herself -- unless, of course, she had also 
elected to be frozen. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, I suppose, that a man and wife could be thawed out 
simultaneously, assuming that both had died of the same disease. In that case a 
joyous reunion might be expected. 
</P>
<P>
But how would a couple manage if they came back to life 50 or 100 years from 
now? Their heads, once unfrozen, would be filled with the myths and realities 
of 1990. Could they cope with the world of 2040 -- if indeed there is a world 
in 2040? They would be so overwhelmed by new technologies and new political and 
social isms, I'm afraid, that they would have to be institutionalized. Very 
probably marriage itself would be a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
I think I'll just sign my insurance policy over to my wife, with my best 
wishes.

Legal Review: A group of young reporters in Indianapolis scored a journalistic 
coup by interviewing retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., 
who told them he was unsure he could "fully agree" with the choice of his 
successor, David H. Souter. Brennan retired in July under doctor's orders to 
reduce his workload and decline all interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Wendy Potasnik, 17, Lisa Schubert, 10, Kia Woodson, 11, and Rob 
Merrill, 15, peppered Brennan, 84, with questions on children's rights, drug 
testing and the death penalty for minors.

Decent Pay: Ivana Trump's pay for running the Plaza Hotel has been increased 
from $1 per year and all the dresses she can buy to an actual salary, says an 
unidentified source quoted in New York magazine. But the magazine adds: "That 
clearly won't be enough to let her continue to live like a Trump." A prenuptial 
agreement with Donald Trump awards her $20 million if they are divorced.

Native Son: Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said he had to do a lot of cajoling, 
but finally got native son and Nobel Prize-winning author Saul Bellow to attend

late. Bellow's birthday is actually June 10.

Appointments: The Secret Service agent credited with saving former President 
Ronald Reagan's life will head the agency's Chicago office. Timothy J. McCarthy 
was wounded when he put himself between Reagan and gunman John Hinckley Jr. in

former first lady Rosalynn Carter a distinguished fellow in a new program named 
for her which studies women in public policy.

NEW AND USEFUL: ROCKING DEVICE GETS KINKS OUT OF THE CALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ProStretch is a rocking device intended to stretch calf muscles before and 
after exercising to help prevent injury. The plastic, U-shaped rocker was 
designed by a former hockey player and is endorsed by former world-champion 
miler Marty Liquori and several professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
It is used by placing one foot in the heel cup of the device, standing an arm's 
length from a wall or other support and slowly rocking the foot backward until 
you feel a slight tension. Hold the heel in place for 15 seconds. Manufacturers 
advise doing the exercise at least three times for each leg. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Fodero, vice president of the New Jersey-based ProStretch company, said 
the device is used by professional basketball and football team members, 
including players from the Los Angeles Clippers, San Francisco 49ers and 
Seattle Supersonics. Otho Davis, head trainer for the Philadelphia Eagles, said 
he has seen many leg-muscle stretching devices in his 35 years as a trainer and 
"nothing works as effectively as this." 
</P>
<P>
ProStretch is available in selected sporting goods stores nationwide and 
retails for about $30. If you can't find it in your area, contact ProStretch, 
125 Broadway, Long Branch, N.J. 07740; (800) 535-3629.

Dad's Drip Strip Removes Latex Paint 
</P>
<P>
Tired of scraping bits of dried latex paint from the floor or woodwork after 
painting? Consider Dad's Drip Strip, a multipurpose, nonflammable remover that 
removes latex paint and appears to have little or no effect on oil-based 
paints, varnishes, shellacs or lacquers. 
</P>
<P>
To use, apply Drip Strip to a soft cloth or paper towel and blot away spots. 
Then rub lightly. It dries fast and leaves no film or residue. It is a remover, 
not a stripper, said Phil Bradley, president of Sansher Corp. in Ft. Wayne, 
Ind., manufacturer of the product. It can be used on wood, glass, ceramic tile, 
Formica, metal, carpet and other fabrics and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Dad's Drip Strip also can clean up glue, caulking, grease, tar, wax, crayon, 
ink, shoe polish, lipstick marks, and adhesive tape. An 8-ounce can retails for 
about $2.99. It's also available in quart and gallon sizes. The remover can be 
purchased in selected home, hardware, paint and building supply stores 
nationwide. If you can't find it in your area, contact Sansher Corp., 8005 N. 
Clinton St., Ft. Wayne, Ind. 46825; (219) 484-2000.

Theater in London since January, 1988, has resigned after the theater's owner, 
David Mirvish, announced last weekend that the last two productions of the

No New Cheers: The owner of Boston's landmark Bull &amp; Finch Pub announced 
that the bar would not change its name to Cheers, the television comedy it 
inspired, because of objections from loyal patrons. Pub owner Thomas Kershaw 
said the Bull &amp; Finch had been negotiating with Paramount Pictures, 
producer of "Cheers," to make the name change, "but our regulars made a 
compelling case to keep the Bull &amp; Finch tradition alive." Created in 1969 
as a neighborhood bar, the pub became an international tourist draw 1982, when 
"Cheers" producers made it the basis of the NBC television series. CLAUDIA PUIG

'ROUGE': A SUPERNATURAL FABLE FILLED WITH ROMANTIC VISIONS

Stanley Kwan's "Rouge" (Nuart) is an exquisite supernatural fable, an opium 
dream of a movie that re-creates glamorous Hong Kong of the '30s and then plays 
it against the city's teeming, workaday present to illuminate and contrast the 
changing relationships between men and women there. 
</P>
<P>
The story focuses on the ravishing Fleur (Anita Mui), whom we first meet in 
1933 in a luxurious Hong Kong brothel then see again in 1987, inexplicably not 
looking a day older and apparently searching for a long-lost lover. The film 
turns upon the old Chinese belief that a day in the spiritual world is roughly 
equivalent to 50 years on earth. 
</P>
<P>
Kwan and writer Lee Pik Wah have created a story that both laments the loss of 
romance of the old ways, but also respects the easy give-and-take between the 
sexes that exists in Hong Kong today. 
</P>
<P>
The film's key setting is that brothel, a sex palace with balconies lined with 
beautiful young women and decorated with jade screens and the finest Venetian 
mirrors. There, we meet Fleur, who has fallen in love with a weak-willed 12th 
Master (Leslie Cheung), a man more interested in pursuing a career in the opera 
than taking over his family's herbal medicine business. 
</P>
<P>
As Fleur and the Master embrace, in an old-movie style close-up, Kwan pans to 
the glittering skyline of 1987 Hong Kong and in that moment we are whisked more 
than a half-century forward to a scene where the still-youthful Fleur, dressed 
in the traditional cheongsam, enters a newspaper office to place a notice in 
the personals column. 
</P>
<P>
From this point on, Kwan shifts between past and present with ever-increasing 
meaning and poignance -- and with an ironic surprise involving Fleur's mission. 
As Kwan gracefully ranges between locales as colorful as the backstage of a 
Chinese opera to a busy present-day movie set, he protests the folly of women 
who out of ingrained custom sacrifice themselves for men -- especially those 
unworthy of them in the first place.

DISHEVELED DOLLS CENTER OF MIKE KELLEY'S SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
PAINTING: THESE HOMEMADE EFFIGIES, SCAVENGED FROM THRIFT SHOPS, HAVE BEEN THE 
FOCUS OF HIS WORK FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. A NEW SHOW IS A DEFT 
DEMONSTRATION OF HIS SKILL AND TALENT.

<P>
Disheveled dolls made from old socks, twisted yarn and mismatched buttons are 
unlikely subjects for major portraiture. Yet, the centerpiece of Mike Kelley's 
current exhibition is just that -- a devastating group of 15 portraits of tatty 
rag dolls. 
</P>
<P>
These homemade effigies, scavenged from neighborhood thrift shops all over 
town, have been the focus of this protean artist's exceptional work for the 
last several years. Kelley's show, which Saturday inaugurated the capacious new 
location of the Rosamund Felsen Gallery (8525 Santa Monica Blvd., West 
Hollywood, to Nov. 10), is a deft demonstration that he's not letting up. 
</P>
<P>
The doll pictures are larger than life. Beautifully painted in black acrylic on 
white gesso, the tallest is slightly more than 7 feet, the shortest about 2 
feet high. Each tattered figure occupies the available, cozy space of its 
individual panel as if it was the only habitat it could ever convincingly know. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley has been painting with black acrylic on white ground (usually paper) for 
10 years now, typically in a notational style that has cared little for 
conventionally applauded techniques. (The treatment owes a significant debt to 
the blunt graphics of Raymond Pettibon.) Shunting aside usual ideas of 
aesthetic quality was part of the point. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since an extensive, 1988 group of perfectly lovely drawings of heaps 
of garbage, Kelley has been refining his handling of paint. In the new doll 
paintings, the range of tones, textures and atmosphere, achieved solely through 
the variegated handling of a single pigment, is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
For an artist whose past work has ranged from an hommage to the "groovy" 
peace-and-love-abstractions of Sister Corita to the gut-groaning raucousness of 
joke-printed cocktail napkins, such technical facility might seem to risk a 
short-circuit. Yet, such deft refinement parallels and underscores the 
intensely hand-crafted preciousness of the subject: Like the handmade dolls, 
the pictures were clearly lavished with attention and care. And by sharp 
contrast, it vivifies an important counterpoint: Despite the common value 
inherent in hand-work, paintings and rag dolls occupy wholly different 
aesthetic worlds, one culturally exalted, the other lowly. 
</P>
<P>
As always in Kelley's work, "high" meets and mingles with "low." In the show, 
there's an explicit example. A child's white cotton blanket is laid on the 
floor, with unraveled skeins of black yarn strewn across its surface. Baby's 
nascent (or undone) yarn-doll is thereby visually likened to a celebrated 
drip-painting by Jackson Pollock. The complex mythology of Abstract 
Expressionism, long a prominent reference point for Kelley's art, is subtly 
framed as having played a candidly parental role for American culture. Kelley, 
born in 1954 at the height of the Ab Ex heyday, is very much its child. 
</P>
<P>
Children, of course, get toys from parents. Kelley's title for the suite of 
doll paintings -- "Empathy Displacement: Humanoid Morphology (Second and Third 
Remove)" -- is a lavish, faux-Freudian spin on the way toys, not to mention 
works of art, are surrogates into which direct engagement with the world is 
shifted. Made as tokens of caring and affection by "loving hands at home," both 
are ritualistic fetishes, familial links in a tangled chain of emotional debt. 
</P>
<P>
These strange and tender paintings are extravagant essays in cruelty and 
pathos. Kelley coaxes forth a disconcerting reading for exalted portraits of 
trashy dolls. Each may be isolated within the bonds of established cultural 
hierarchy, yet both are containers for sentimentalized, inescapably poignant 
feelings of need and satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley typically works in pseudo-scientific sets of information, as if 
conducting an artistic research project. The "humanoid morphology" of the 
present endeavor seems to go like this: Rag dolls occupy the first remove, 
their portraits are the second. The third remove appears to be on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
There, at the foot of each panel, rests a rectangular black box. Smaller in 
size than the panel it accompanies, its proportions match the painting's. On 
the front near the top, a small door or lid waits to be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you don't have to lift the lid to know exactly what is secreted 
inside each little "coffin." Artists have been laying out corpses beneath 
paintings of mortal loss at least since the Renaissance. This isn't to say you 
don't excitedly lift the lid anyway. And that's the kicker. The sight of the 
actual rag doll's little face, which blindly peers out from the glass-covered 
doorway, generates a shriek: You knew what you were going to see before you 
looked, but you still can't quite believe your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In our fantasy-drenched world, knowledge is no protection. The capacity for 
belief is anesthetized when the enticing fictions of mass-culture are as 
pervasive as nature used to be. A group of "cluster paintings" in the show 
suggest themselves as portraits of a self adrift in such a world: Five 
"satellite" panels -- smaller appendages sporting pictures of trash bags, 
convicts, rag dolls, the severed toes of a foot, and victims of the Tien An Men 
massacre -- orbit around a central body. The body is blank. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicted pitch of Kelley's art (if not its wildly dissimilar subject 
matter) regularly puts me in mind of Goya, another artist for whom a horror at 
human cruelty was infused with paradoxical empathy for the dark fears that fuel 
it. That Goya-esque quality is most powerfully felt in a riveting, multi-panel 
painting called "Carnival Time." 
</P>
<P>
Like the doll paintings, the eight bizarre, black-on-white panels of "Carnival 
Time" stand on the floor. Up against the wall and not quite edge-to-edge, 
they're held together like the slats of a picket fence. To the left, the 
severed heads of five politicians -- including, for the apparent sake of 
bipartisan unity, George Bush and Thomas Foley -- are impaled atop tall posts, 
flies buzzing gaily about their blank-eyed faces. 
</P>
<P>
Next to these "lords of the flies" comes a demonic vision of Sleeping Beauty's 
Disneyland castle: Flanked by guillotines, with bats swooping overhead through 
cathedral-like spires, a Colonial fife-and-drum corps composed of Donald, Goofy 
and Mickey marches proudly forth. This is followed by the rotund profile of a 
huge sow with sagging teats, who sports the pointed, polka-dotted cap of a 
dunce or clown. Finally, at the right, there's an image of a heavy-metal rock 
band in wild performance. 
</P>
<P>
This hellish union of vulgarity, corruption, decadence and insensibility 
circles around being a modern embodiment of "the sleep of reason" -- except for 
the niggling fact that our nightmare is one from which no awakening is in 
sight. Goya's disgust with a corrupt and fanatical Establishment, which he was 
obliged to endorse through his official capacity as painter to the court, found 
expression in an Enlightenment embrace of knowledge, both intellectual and 
emotional. In the Byzantine court of contemporary life, Kelley's swollen 
pig-in-a-party-hat is fair indication that conventional appeals to reason are 
no longer cause for faith.

DIVERSE ACTS CONVERGE AT 'GATHERING OF TRIBES'; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERT: THE ALL-DAY POP SMORGASBORD ATTRACTED A FAIR-SIZED CROWD. THE 14-ACT 
BILL HAD STYLISTS RANGING FROM HARD ROCK TO FOLK TO RAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chalk up one small blow for diversity, if not for overriding musical 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "A Gathering of the Tribes," the all-day pop smorgasbord on Sunday at 
the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa attracted 9,000 to 10,000 people, 
according to promoters -- not bad for a 14-act bill that lacked even a single 
marquee name capable of headlining an amphitheater in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This gathering sprang from English rocker Ian Astbury's idea of creating a 
festival of contrasting stylists ranging from hard rock to folk to rap. While 
at least 95% of the audience was white, listeners' enthusiastic embrace of the 
lineup's two rap acts, and their willingness to sample and enjoy the 10-hour 
day's full range of performers, showed that diversity has a constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Any worries about rap being rejected, or merely tolerated, disappeared the 
moment Queen Latifah burst onto the stage late in the afternoon with hammering 
beats and exuberant personality. 
</P>
<P>
Her raps offered overworked, boastful themes, but what she said mattered less 
than how she said it. The New Jersey rapper's 20-minute set communicated zest, 
humor and friendliness, and a healthy measure of confidence and self-respect. 
She also got Sinead O'Connor to come out and say "hello," but that's all. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup's other rapper, Ice-T, was all profane bluster and attitude: some 
good comments on the racism involved in rap censorship, and some unrepentant 
sexism in his raps. 
</P>
<P>
More rap was expected, but the popular, controversial Public Enemy didn't 
appear as first advertised. Speaking angrily to the crowd at separate 
junctures, Astbury, Latifah and Ice-T said Public Enemy was missing because of 
pressure from local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden denied that his department had 
anything to do with preventing Public Enemy from playing. A Public Enemy 
spokesman was still attempting Tuesday to determine why the band did not 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Shocked, backed by Tower of Power and romping with rocking blues and 
R&amp;B, turned in a satisfying set that also included a stark, eloquent new 
ballad about coping with grief. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some lovely harmonies, the Indigo Girls could have taken some hints 
from Shocked about the advantages of not being too solemn. Iggy Pop was awfully 
restrained considering his well-earned position as one of rock's most 
combustive live performers. The day's least-known acts, Canadian folk-rockers 
Crash Vegas and British '60s revivalists Charlatans U.K., were promising 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest, the London Quireboys regurgitated old Rod Stewart and the 
Faces stuff, sans the warmth, humor and bonhomie. The Cramps played longer -- 
and worse -- than any other band on the bill. Soundgarden packed a rumbling 
wallop, and singer Chris Cornell's emotional howls lifted some numbers out of 
the instrumental murk. 
</P>
<P>
Mission U.K.'s barefoot singer Wayne Hussey was an extremely energetic 
panderer, but still little more than a panderer. Former Sex Pistols guitarist 
Steve Jones makes a decent hard-rock sidekick, but his singing was too weak to 
make him much of a band leader. 
</P>
<P>
Things improved when Astbury took over the vocals for the last three songs, and 
his partner in the Cult, Billy Duffy, arrived to add some guitar riffing. But 
it wasn't enough to fire up a crowd that was tiring near the end of a long day.

THEATRE OF THE DEAF'S SIGNED AND SPOKEN 'SPRING'

PALM DESERT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may seem a bit incongruous for the National Theatre of the Deaf to launch a 
Southland tour of Robert Nathan's "One More Spring" in this manicured desert 
enclave. J Ranelli's adaptation of the 60-year-old Nathan novel about the 
endurance of the spirited through a bitter New York winter during the Great 
Depression certainly finds its echo in the '90s, but not necessarily in this 
wealthy, security-gated community. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the paradox fazed no one last week at the McCallum Theatre of the Bob Hope 
Cultural Center, where a moderate audience vigorously applauded the effort of 
this 25-year-old Connecticut-based bilingual company. 
</P>
<P>
The languages spoken by the NTD are sign language and English. Made up of 
hearing and deaf actors, this ensemble reverses the usual procedure: It 
"speaks" sign language, while a pair of on-stage narrators (Tommy Cheng and 
Kymberli Colbourne) offer a verbal translation on the side. 
</P>
<P>
In "One More Spring," which adapter Ranelli also directs, this well-practiced, 
well-integrated system illustrates the story of two homeless men -- antiquarian 
Jared Otkar (Chuck Baird) and violinist Morris Rosenberg (Adrian Blue) -- who 
set up house in a Central Park tool shed thanks to the generosity of the local 
park sweeper, Mr. Sweeney (Mark Allen Branson). 
</P>
<P>
Otkar has salvaged a bed from his antique shop and Rosenberg his violin and a 
precious coat that doubles as a blanket now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Into this modest abode Otkar invites Elizabeth Cheney (a passionate Camille L. 
Jeter), a spritely prostitute with an indestructible innocence, who wins 
Otkar's heart, Rosenberg's friendship and even the acceptance of the deeply 
shocked and Catholic Mrs. Sweeney (a funny Susan Jackson). 
</P>
<P>
Woven into this tale, is the guilty banker, Mr. Sheridan (Josif Schneiderman), 
who is rescued from the lake and his own terrors by this forgiving band of 
indigents. 
</P>
<P>
"Elizabeth Cheney had not expected to take care of a banker; she had thought it 
would be the other way around," says storyteller Nat Wilson, the sign language 
narrator of the piece, humorously summing up what was on everybody's mind. 
</P>
<P>
A program note appropriately compares this sweet fable to Frank Capra's "It's a 
Wonderful Life" and Kaufman and Hart's "You Can't Take It With You." The period 
and the sensibilities are indeed the same and it was wise of Ranelli not to 
attempt an update. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its uncommon bilingual convention, what distinguishes this NTD 
production is its fluid, non-representational ensemble style, crowned by the 
splendid musical contributions of solo violinist Douglas Ellison and composer 
Max Showalter. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison's exquisite playing of Showalter's music and of numerous other 
classical gems is the transcendent third language spoken here. It is a key 
element, at all times weaving its uncontested magic through the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Ranelli's staging on an overly busy set by NTD artistic director David Hays 
sometimes threatens to run into itself, but collisions are carefully averted. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Greenwood's period costuming serves to anchor us in the '30s, which makes 
it easier to accept the sentimentality of Nathan's fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
Its larger implications for the importance of human generosity remain timeless 
and universal. 
</P>

BERNHARDT FOES GAIN TIME WITH RECALL PETITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: MORE THAN 11,800 SIGNATURES ARE TURNED IN, BUT COUNCILWOMAN'S 
CAMP EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE THAT UP TO HALF WILL BE INVALIDATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moving a step closer to San Diego's first City Council recall election, a group 
seeking to oust Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt turned in more than 11,800 
signatures on recall petitions Tuesday -- a number sufficient to at least give 
Bernhardt's opponents more time to qualify the issue for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Recall Bernhardt Committee concede that they will probably be 
short of the 11,240 valid signatures needed after local election officials 
verify the 11,832 names on their petitions -- a process that typically results 
in 25% or more of the signatures being ruled invalid for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
However, a quirk in local law -- one that could be challenged in court by 
Bernhardt's backers -- will give the recall committee about six more weeks to 
reach the number of signatures required to force an election early next year, 
city administrators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This recall will be on the ballot," Kathy Gaustad, chairman of the 
anti-Bernhardt group, said after the group turned in the petitions to the city 
clerk's office. "With the extra time, there's no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
But Bernhardt defender Jean Andrews predicted that the recall effort ultimately 
will fail to qualify for the ballot, saying she believes that the signature 
verification process will show that as many as 50% of the names turned in 
Tuesday are invalid. With Tuesday's deadline approaching, Andrews charged, 
Gaustad's group knowingly began collecting invalid signatures from voters 
outside Bernhardt's 5th District simply to "buy more time" by surpassing the 
11,240-name figure. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been losing momentum for a couple of weeks," said Andrews, manager of 
a group calling itself Together for Linda Bernhardt. "I don't think they're 
going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Under the procedures governing recall elections, the 11,832 signatures that 
were gathered over the past 39 days will be reviewed by the San Diego County 
registrar of voters to determine their validity. That checking process is 
expected to be completed in about two weeks, according to city elections 
officer Mike Haas. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to reside in the proper district or ineligibility to vote often result 
in many signatures on such petitions being declared invalid. In addition, 
Bernhardt's supporters collected 747 signatures on "rescission" forms -- which 
also must be verified -- in which individuals ask that their names be removed 
from the pro-recall petitions. 
</P>
<P>
If the number of verified signatures is less than the required 11,240 -- which 
equals 15% of the registered voters in Bernhardt's district -- the 
councilwoman's opponents will have an additional 30 days to file so-called 
"supplemental" petitions in an effort to reach that target. 
</P>
<P>
While awaiting the verification of the signatures turned in Tuesday, Gaustad's 
committee plans to immediately begin circulating the supplemental petitions -- 
meaning the group will have roughly six additional weeks to collect more 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Should the group eventually collect sufficient valid signatures, the City 
Council must schedule a recall election -- and a tandem race to determine 
Bernhardt's possible successor -- within 60 to 90 days. That timetable probably 
would produce an election between next February and April. 
</P>
<P>
A simple majority vote would determine Bernhardt's political fate. If she 
received more than 50% of the vote, Bernhardt would retain her post, rendering 
the outcome of the companion election on possible successors moot. However, if 
Bernhardt is ousted, the candidate who draws the most votes in the other race 
would serve the remainder of the four-year term to which she was elected last 
November in a district stretching from Mira Mesa to Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The acrimonious charges and countercharges that have dominated the 
signature-collection campaign could prove to be a harbinger of what by its very 
nature almost certainly would be a bitter recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have accused the other of using strong-arm, illegal tactics to 
either deceive people into signing the recall petitions or to discourage them 
from doing so. Last weekend, an altercation between the two sides resulted in 
police being summoned to a Mira Mesa supermarket, and the anti-Bernhardt forces 
have filed several police reports alleging that they were physically assaulted 
by Bernhardt workers. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Kingsley, who directed the nearly two dozen paid signature collectors who 
supplemented the pro-recall campaign's volunteers, also charged Tuesday that 
petitions with perhaps as many as 4,000 signatures on them "mysteriously 
disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Though she admitted there is "no way (of being) absolutely sure what happened," 
Kingsley claimed that some of her workers said a competing signature-collection 
group working on Bernhardt's behalf offered them more money to "switch sides" 
and to turn over the petitions already circulated. 
</P>
<P>
Denying that charge, Andrews said her workers actually rebuffed some pro-recall 
signature gatherers' offers to turn over their petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's news conference at the city clerk's office, meanwhile, included 
several unintentionally humorous moments. At one point, a pro-recall worker 
attempted to turn in his petitions to a Bernhardt aide standing behind the 
office's counter to observe the proceedings -- leading to jokes about how those 
signatures might be tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the same Bernhardt staffer passed out a press release headlined 
"Bernhardt Announces Recall Failure" -- an analysis that, at best, is 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent that the recall committee failed," Bernhardt said in the 
statement. "I am confident that they did not and cannot collect enough valid 
signatures. . . . The time has come for the divisiveness in this community to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders have cited a number of factors as the impetus behind what would 
be the first recall election since the city charter was approved early this 
century. Prominent among the reasons is their dissatisfaction with Bernhardt's 
approval of a controversial redistricting plan that would shift several 
high-growth neighborhoods from her district into another council district -- an 
issue that political consultant Jack Orr terms "the proverbial straw that broke 
the camel's back." 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents also have complained that, since her election, Bernhardt has 
accepted campaign contributions from developers after pledging not to do so in 
last year's campaign, and also fault her for hiring her roommate as her City 
Hall chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to refer to Linda as the 'Stealth Bulldozer,' " said recall volunteer 
Ken Moser, using a variation of the "Bulldozer Ed" label that Bernhardt hung on 
then-Councilman Ed Struiksma in last fall's council race. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the recall effort "politics at its very worst," Bernhardt defended 
herself at the outset of the petition-circulation period by saying, "I've done 
my job and kept my campaign promises to manage growth, protect the environment 
and respond to neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the number of signatures collected by Gaustad's group ultimately is 
deemed sufficient to mandate a recall election, several thorny legal questions 
could result in a court challenge -- an option that "we're keeping open," 
Andrews emphasized Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt's supporters have questioned the legality of the "supplemental" 
petition period, as well as accused Gaustad's group of exceeding a 300-word 
limit on the pro-recall statement that accompanied their petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this is over, we'll probably be sued by both sides," Assistant City 
Clerk Jack Fishkin said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: COULD WE GET A FEW AIRCRAFT CARRIERS IN THE PARKING LOT?

A San Diego labor union wants you to think of Saddam Hussein before you shop at 
a grocery market in Linda Vista owned by an Iraqi. 
</P>
<P>
The union is asking for a boycott of a store owned by Victor Najor by comparing 
him to the Iraqi dictator. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began more than a year ago when employees at Najor's stores in the 
Linda Vista and Nestor neighborhoods of San Diego voted to be represented by 
the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 135. 
</P>
<P>
But Najor and the union have yet to agree on a contract. Now the union has 
mailed out a flyer complete with a picture of Hussein: 
</P>
<P>
"Worried about the hostages in Iraq? What about the hostage situation in your 
own neighborhood?" 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side: 
</P>
<P>
"Victor Najor, an Iraqi businessman and owner of the Victory Foods store in 
your neighborhood, is holding his employees hostage -- to inferior pay, 
inferior conditions of employment and little or no job security. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States Government has conducted a democratic election of the 
employees of Victory Foods, and they voted to be represented by a union. But 
negotiating a contract with Victor Najor is like negotiating with Saddam 
Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
There's more: 
</P>
<P>
"As a community, let's help Victory Foods' employees fulfill their rights as 
free Americans! Boycott Victory Foods." 
</P>
<P>
Najor, one of 8,000 Chaldeans (Christian Iraqis) who have settled in San Diego 
County in recent years, has had other problems, too. A rowdy stomped on a Saudi 
Arabian flag hanging in one of his stores. 
</P>
<P>
Najor isn't around to discuss the union flyer. He's on his way home from a trip 
to Israel with a church group. 
</P>
<P>
His partner and attorney won't talk. Neither will the labor union. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor who received the flyer says it persuaded her to start shopping at 
Victory Foods: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the flyer is offensive. Whatever the labor dispute, I think it's 
outrageous to mention that Najor is an Iraqi and smear him with a picture of 
Saddam Hussein." 
</P>

A San Diego-based company that handles phone-in reservations for New York state 
campsites is catching flak for long delays and lack of information. 
</P>

"You call the 800 number, get put on hold, and you get a San Diego radio 
station saying, 'It's 70 degrees outside and the surf's up,' " grumbled a

In his campaign literature for Assembly, former San Diego City Councilman Mike 
Gotch says he "led (the) successful opposition" to North City West.

FATALLY STABBED PROFESSOR'S CARE ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UC San Diego professor who died 10 days ago from stab wounds should have been 
transferred to a trauma hospital instead of being treated at a small East San 
Diego hospital, a leading San Diego trauma surgeon said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question he should have been transferred here," said Mercy Hospital 
trauma surgeon Dr. Richard W. Virgilio. "Sure, I'm upset. It could have been 
you. It could have been me." 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Thomas, a UCSD psychology professor lauded as the father of black 
psychology, died during surgery at 1:40 a.m. Sept. 30. That was nearly 2 1/2 
hours after a passer-by took him to Villa View Community Hospital at 5550 
University Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances of how Thomas received the wounds are unknown and police 
investigating the case have made no arrests. The passer-by had found him in his 
car in a bank parking lot, stabbed several times in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Under county trauma system guidelines, these injuries made him a prime 
candidate for transfer to a trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they're dead already, and they have penetrating wounds, they'll go to 
a trauma hospital -- because that's the only place you'd have a chance," 
Virgilio said. "And this guy was far from dead. He had 2, 2 1/2 hours before he 
died." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to reply to Virgilio's concerns, Villa View administrator Jonathan 
Sprecher said the comments were made without enough information about Thomas' 
case. Sprecher said his hospital acted quickly and appropriately, but Thomas 
had lost too much blood before he arrived at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This patient arrived in our facility at 11:10 p.m. He was in full-blown 
(heart) arrest at 11:20. . . . When we had a heartbeat back on him, I had 
surgeons ready and available, and they immediately took him into surgery. That 
is in no way inappropriate medical care," Sprecher said. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we been able to transfer him, had he been stable at all to be transferred, 
we would have gladly transferred him," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In past cases, Villa View has routinely transferred such patients to Mercy 
after they arrived at Villa View's emergency room by private car, both men 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Virgilio said he was out of town when Thomas died, but checked with Villa View 
afterward to ask why the transfer had not occurred. The reply was that the 
emergency room physician on duty at the time was filling in for the regular 
physician, and was not familiar with the country trauma system, Virgilio said. 
</P>
<P>
Sprecher agreed that the emergency physician on duty was new to Villa View, but 
he said it was Thomas' low to "nonexistent" blood pressure that prevented the 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Without a detailed review of a traumatic death, no outside doctor can say 
definitively whether the life would have been saved if the patient had been at 
a trauma hospital, trauma doctors agree. However, numerous studies and 
statistical reports show a drop in preventable deaths when such patients are 
funneled into trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
Consisting of six hospitals stretching from Escondido to San Diego, the San 
Diego County trauma system was set up in 1984. Teams of surgeons and nurses are 
on duty around-the-clock to meet the special needs of trauma patients. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, services such as a fully equipped blood bank have to be available 
24 hours at trauma centers. This is because penetrating wounds or blunt injury 
can cause catastrophic internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
Often this is because of a damaged portal vein that conveys blood from the 
abdominal organs to the liver. It was an injury to this vein that caused 
Thomas' massive blood loss before he reached the hospital, Sprecher said. 
</P>
<P>
Sprecher would not say, however, what time Thomas went into surgery or how much 
blood he was given before and during surgery, citing privacy considerations. 
</P>
<P>
When Thomas arrived at Villa View at 11:10 p.m. Sept. 29, he was still 
conscious and talking, police say. Sprecher said Thomas lost consciousness 
within a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Cooper, chief of emergency services for San Diego County, said at Tuesday 
that her office was concerned about Thomas' death. 
</P>
<P>
"EMS is looking into it," Cooper said. "It appears that the (trauma) system did 
not work for Dr. Thomas." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the inquiry was being hampered because Villa View officials had 
failed to return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted about an hour later, Sprecher said Villa View's chief of staff, Dr. 
James Norton, had called Cooper's office in the intervening hour to talk about 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that there had been any "official communications" from the county. 
"Calling and talking to a staff nurse does not constitute official 
communication," Sprecher said. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's autopsy results on Thomas were not available Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traumatic-injury patients who do not make it into the trauma system are a 
continuing concern among trauma doctors, Virgilio and others say. However, it 
only happens a few times a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
More commonly, hospitals or paramedics "overtriage" patients, referring them to 
trauma centers when their injuries are not severe enough, he said. That 
situation is considered preferable, however, because it prevents unnecessary 
deaths from injuries that are catastrophic but sometimes missed in a basic 
hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomas case is expected to be discussed next week at a meeting of the 
trauma system's medical audit committee, although the panel's detailed 
consideration of the case won't occur for about three months, Cooper said.

FAMILY AWAITS A REBIRTH OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ricky Reed turned 5 on Tuesday. But how many more birthdays he'll live to 
celebrate may depend on whether he can receive a lifesaving bone marrow 
transplant from a brother or sister who is due to be born in five days. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky has suffered from leukemia since he was 22 months old, and his parents, 
with the help of the National Marrow Donor Program, have searched the United 
States and Europe for a donor of bone marrow -- the thick, almost granular 
substance within bone structure that manufactures the blood's red and white 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
In Ricky's case, it's the stuff that could save his life by providing him with 
the raw material necessary to replenish his body with healthy white blood 
cells. But no donors have been found yet who match Ricky's exact blood and 
antigen types. Now his best bet for the future may rest with an unborn sibling 
whose due date is Monday. 
</P>
<P>
While the chances of finding compatible bone marrow donors among unrelated 
people is 1 in 20,000 -- and the reality can be 1 in a million -- the chance of 
a match between siblings is 1 in 4. 
</P>
<P>
But little Ricky isn't watching the odds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more excited about having a baby sister than the fact that the baby may 
save his life," Theresa Reed said Tuesday while her kindergartner son 
celebrated his birthday with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle swords, pajamas and 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Richard -- a Navy hospital corpsman -- live on the 
northern fringe of Camp Pendleton, near San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"Ricky's living as normal a life as possible. He doesn't think about it (the 
leukemia) all the time, but he does know that he can die from it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reeds thought they were getting close to finding a compatible donor when 
the national registry found five people in the United States -- and two more in 
Europe -- who showed on the first screening that they might match. But further 
testing eliminated them. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's other child, 2 1/2-year-old Ruben, didn't match, either. 
</P>
<P>
So, for years, Ricky has received a steady regimen of chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment as he roller-coasters between remissions and relapses. Now 
the leukemia has infected his spinal fluid and entered his brain, and the 
youngster undergoes regular spinal taps to relieve the pressure in his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows something's up when the headaches won't go away. He knows he's got 
cancer, but he doesn't understand why, or why him, or the depth of it," his 
mother said. "He's constantly asking questions, and constantly learning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hiding anything from him. It's not fair for a child to go through so 
much pain without knowing what he's got. We don't want him to be scared, but we 
talk to him about what he has, and that it can be fatal, and we talk about God, 
and how we accept the fact that there's nothing we can do but be there for him 
and support him." 
</P>
<P>
But a wellspring of hope erupted nine months ago -- coincidentally, at a low 
point in the family's life, when Ricky was being treated for another infection 
that required he be taken off chemotherapy. With the lapse of that medication, 
his bone marrow cancer flared up, sending the family into depression. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, the Reeds learned Theresa was pregnant with her third 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a miracle," she said. "It's the best we can hope for. We know the 
baby may not match Ricky -- we've been let down before -- and we won't let our 
hopes go real high. But still. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The baby will be delivered at the Navy Hospital at Camp Pendleton, and the 
newborn will be typed for its human leukocyte antigens -- the six particular 
components of blood that should match identically with the would-be recipient. 
</P>
<P>
There are 210,000 potential donors registered with the National Marrow Donor 
Program -- a number that virtually doubled in the past six months with 
increased awareness. But the critical antigens are somewhat linked to race and 
ethnicity, and only about 1.5% of the donors are Latino, like Ricky. 
</P>
<P>
That's why all the attention is focused, for now, on the new baby. 
</P>
<P>
If the siblings prove compatible, doctors will wait as long as necessary -- 
weeks, or maybe months-for Ricky's leukemia to again go into remission. Then he 
and his new brother or sister will be flown to Seattle's acclaimed Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the largest bone marrow transplant unit in 
the world, for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
While chemotherapy and radiation remain the primary treatments for leukemia, 
bone marrow transplants have grown in popularity in recent years -- thanks 
largely to the growth of the donor list. 
</P>
<P>
The use of children -- even babies -- as donors is increasing as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The youngest donor I'm aware of was a 6-week-old baby, and the marrow 
transplantation was successful," said Dr. Carl Lenarsky, medical director for 
the transplantation program at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I've done transplantations involving a baby 5 or 6 months old, and 
that was successful, too," he said. "It's technically feasible, and can be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Given the time it will take for Ricky to re-enter remission, and for the 
newborn to be tested, the baby will likely be at least 6 weeks old before the 
transplant is done -- assuming the two children match -- he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Kadota, director of bone marrow transplantations at Children's 
Hospital of San Diego, said doctors prefer to wait until a baby is 6 months 
old, if not a year, before undertaking the procedure. "But you don't always 
have the luxury of waiting that long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In such procedures, the donor is put under a general anesthetic, and a needle 
is inserted into the center of the hip -- the body's largest bone. A tablespoon 
of marrow is withdrawn for every kilogram of the recipient's body weight, then 
introduced into the recipient's body by a catheter that leads directly to the 
heart, where it then is carried to the bones and settles. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest risk to the recipient during the recovery time is infection; for 
the donor, it is the anesthesia itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some medical ethicists question the use of babies as donors of bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"The first issue is, is it right to impose risk on a child in order, solely, to 
benefit another person?" said Art Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical 
Ethics at the University of Minnesota, who specializes in the ethics of 
transplantation. 
</P>
<P>
"The second issue is, who can give consent for the baby, since normally we 
presume parents can, but in these kinds of situations -- donations between 
siblings -- there may be a conflict of interest. Should there be a third party 
-- an ethics committee, a guardian, a court or an advocate for the newborn 
child?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologically, he said, the parents have to be braced for the possibility 
that the newborn child's bone marrow won't match the older child's -- and 
consider the baby a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"The hidden issue is the strain on the parents who have a child who is dying, 
and are filled with joy because of the birth of a new child. That's an 
incredible burden," Caplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenarsky agreed that ethicists have debated turning to babies as donors of bone 
marrow -- but says he endorses the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The chance of doing overwhelming good outweighs the very slight risk to the 
baby," he said. "And in situations like this, reasonable people believe a child 
would give his consent, if he could." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Reed, meanwhile, is focusing on other matters. "I got a Ninja Turtle 
poster for my birthday!" he blurted. "And I've got a girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
People interested in donating marrow can call the San Diego Blood Bank at 
296-6393 or the National Marrow Donor Program at 1-800-654-1247.

SCHOOLS TO CHARGE FOR DRIVER TRAINING R

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Unified School District board approved a plan Tuesday to charge 
high school students a fee for driver training classes, which had been 
suspended because of state budget cuts. The district's proposal, passed by a 4 
to 1 vote, transfers financial jurisdiction of driver training from its general 
fund to its adult education program. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of receiving the training for free, a fee will be charged.Board 
President Barbara Myers voted against the proposal. Statewide, schools are 
grappling to find ways to continue offering the program after Gov. George 
Deukmejian vetoed $21.2 million in driver training funds when he signed the 
final budget in July. Other districts, including the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District, have already decided to offer driver training for a fee 
through adult education or community education programs. The Conejo district 
charges students $120 for behind-the-wheel training. The cost for the training 
in Ventura has not yet been determined but may be between $120 and $150, 
depending on the number of students who sign up, Assistant Supt. Richard 
Welcher said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

WATER USAGE FALLS 24% IN SEPTEMBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Water use in the city of Ventura was down 24% last month compared with 
September of last year, city officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Since inception of a mandatory conservation program, water use was down 26% in 
June, 22.1% in July and 18.4% in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not very pleased when we dipped below 20% in our conservation efforts, 
but I am very pleased to see the public responding to what is a real crisis," 
Ventura Mayor Richard Francis said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Water use in September fell after water bills contained penalties for excess 
water use for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of city officials is to reduce water use by 30% over last year, but 
they relaxed the goal during the hot summer months. They are optimistic that 
they can increase conservation during the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
A four-year drought has depleted the city's water reserves, and officials 
estimate a 20% overall water reduction will be needed to make up for the 
shortfall. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

<P>
Staff members of the Ventura Unified School District recommended to the school 
board Tuesday night that the district take the suggestion of Aquatic 
Engineering Inc. and build a new pool, costing between $456,000 and $518,000. 
</P>
<P>
The only other option is to repair cracks in the pool shell, one of which runs 
nearly half the width of the pool, and to repair leaky underground pipes, said 
Eric Fraer, assistant project manager with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Repairing the pool could cost as much as $190,000, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no guarantee how long those repairs would last," Assistant Supt. 
Richard Welcher said. "We could do it and five days later it could crack 
again." 
</P>
<P>
At its next meeting, the board will consider the district staff's 
recommendation to remove the pool and build a new 12-foot-deep diving pool for 
an estimated $518,000. 
</P>
<P>
The major obstacle is that the district lacks funding for a new pool and must 
find a way to pay for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The staff recommended that school officials meet with Ventura city officials to 
discuss construction of a community aquatics center that would be available to 
students for competitive training and would also be open to the public.

TEMPERATURES TO COOL AS SANTA ANA WINDS DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana condition that brought unseasonably warm weather and clear skies 
to the San Diego area is expected to dissipate today, auguring a return to 
cooler temperatures and traditional coastal clouds. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is expected to remain mostly clear through Thursday, except for 
some patchy low clouds and coastal fog early Thursday, according to the 
National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The weakening Santa Ana could also mean worsened air pollution, particularly in 
coastal areas in North San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Santa Ana starts to break down, we can expect unhealthful 
conditions," said Tom Ryan, assistant meteorologist with the county Air 
Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
That is so, Ryan explained, in part because pollutants blown out to sea during 
the Santa Ana period may return above the land mass, particularly along the 
coastal strip. The possible result: a photochemical soup in the coastal sky. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Ryan said, there is a possibility of a Stage 1 smog alert today 
in some North County areas, meaning that persons with respiratory ailments and 
others sensitive to pollution would be urged to remain indoors. It would be the 
first such alert this year, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two days, however, the Santa Ana conditions have brought good air 
quality to the entire San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when the desert-like conditions reached their peak, a high of 90 
degrees was recorded at Lindbergh Field, just short of the record high of 92 
set in 1976. The normal high temperature for the date is 75 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Some area highs Tuesday included 98 in La Mesa, 97 in Santee, 96 in Fallbrook 
and 95 in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's low at Lindbergh Field was 58 degrees, slightly below the date's 
normal of 62. The coolest lows were the 42 degree readings recorded at Santee 
and on Palomar Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs are expected to be 78 to 84 degrees today, cooling to 73 to 78 on 
Thursday. Inland areas, as usual, are expected to be somewhat warmer.

COUNTY TO BUILD PUBLIC HOUSING FOR FARM WORKERS; 
</P>
<P>
SHELTER: A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES WILL BE USED TO CONSTRUCT 38 
THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENTS IN SAN MARCOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County supervisors voted Tuesday to move ahead with plans to build 
and operate a public housing project for farm workers in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Board members voted to authorize the county housing agency to apply for about 
$4 million in state and federal funds for the project. Under the plan, the bulk 
of the funds, more than $3.5 million, would come from the U.S. Farmers Home 
Administration, with $400,000 from state Housing and Community Development 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the county to purchase 7.9 acres of undeveloped land in San 
Marcos for $865,000 from a private owner and build 38 three-bedroom apartments 
for farm worker families. Gabriel Rodriguez, county director of Housing and 
Community Development, said the parcel is located on Firebird Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald, who has been working with various government 
agencies to find a way to build much-needed farm worker housing, said the 
project will cost about $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking a lot about doing something about (farm worker) housing. . 
. . This action is significant because we're finally doing something about it," 
MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Farm worker and migrant housing has evolved as an emotional issue in North 
County over the years. The rapid development of the area has placed newly built 
communities on the doorsteps of migrant camps featuring lean-tos and other 
crudely fashioned shacks. Many migrants work in the agriculture industry or as 
day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez stressed that all of the proposed units would be made available only 
to farm workers. In order to qualify, an applicant would have to earn at least 
51% of his or her income from agriculture, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no lacking for a population group who would qualify," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that in San Marcos alone there are about 600 students who come 
from farm worker families. He added that figures provided by the state 
Employment Development Department suggest there are between 10,000 and 12,000 
people employed in agriculture in North County. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said the planned 38 units of housing are a modest beginning, but he 
called it the start of a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the number of (farm workers) who need housing in North 
County, it looks like a drop in the bucket. But my feeling is if you never 
start, you never finish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no timetable for the project. Qualifying for federal funding remains a 
major hurdle, but MacDonald said he is optimistic that serious planning for the 
project can begin next summer. 
</P>
<P>
State funding for the project will come from funds established for farm worker 
housing resulting from a bill introduced last year by Assemblyman Nolan Frazee 
(R-Carlsbad). 
</P>
<P>
However, the project could also be victimized by another hitch. According to a 
report submitted to the board, the city of San Marcos will have to provide 
almost $730,000 in funds and fee waivers in order for the project to begin. 
About $640,000 in funds would come from the city's redevelopment agency, while 
about $90,000 would come in building fee waivers. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos City Manager Rick Gittings said that the City Council has not made 
any financial commitments to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We've indicated that we are certainly willing to assist them on proposing and 
working on the project," Gittings said. "But the city has made no financial 
commitments at this point. . . . At this point there are more questions than 
answers, but we are willing to work with them on this project." 
</P>
<P>
The board took additional action Tuesday to deal with the issue of farm worker 
housing. Board members approved a proposal to waive building fees for growers 
who want to build housing for their employees and to speed up their 
applications.

TRIAL OPENS FOR WOMAN IN FATAL DRUNK DRIVING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE NEWHALL RESIDENT IS CHARGED WITH VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER IN THE DEATH 
OF A CANADIAN MOTORCYCLIST. SHE HAS BEEN ARRESTED SIX TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Newhall woman with a history of six drunk-driving arrests went on trial 
Tuesday in the death of a Canadian motorcyclist she allegedly ran down while 
driving drunk on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, is charged in San Fernando Superior Court with 
vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk driving in connection with the Oct. 4, 
1989, death of David Jaggs, 24. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs was riding his motorcycle about 8:30 p.m. with his wife, Janine, 21, when 
they were struck from behind by a truck driven by Giunta, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs and his wife were thrown from the motorcycle and run over by the truck, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaggs died later that night. His wife was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been married a month earlier and had moved to the Los Angeles 
area to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Giunta had a blood-alcohol level of 0.29% -- more 
than three times the level at which a person is considered legally drunk -- 
shortly after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was Giunta's fifth for drunk driving since 1974, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
She was arrested a sixth time while free on bail after the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
In all but one case, the drunk-driving charges were either reduced or dismissed 
because she has been able to manipulate the court system, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Her one conviction for drunk driving came in 1983, when Giunta was sentenced by 
a Pasadena judge to three years probation and ordered to perform community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
A judge in West Covina reduced a 1974 drunk-driving charge to a minor traffic 
violation, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey, who is prosecuting 
Giunta in the current case. 
</P>
<P>
Giunta was given probation and ordered to pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
In a March, 1989, case, two breath tests showed Giunta's blood-alcohol level 
was 0.16% and 0.17% after she ran into another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found an open bottle of vodka in Giunta's car, but Giunta said she 
began drinking the liquor after the collision because she was so upset. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors failed to reach a verdict and the charge was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Another drunk-driving charge from Alhambra was dropped in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
And she was acquitted in August of the drunk-driving charge brought while she 
was free on bail in the accident that killed Jaggs. 
</P>
<P>
In both those cases, prosecutors lacked evidence necessary to convict Giunta 
because she refused to submit to blood-alcohol tests, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers cannot force a drunk-driving suspect to submit to 
blood-alcohol tests unless the person is suspected of a felony in which someone 
has been injured or killed, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said California Highway Patrol officers had to hold Giunta down while 
they administered the test after her arrest in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
She is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fernandez, Giunta's attorney in most of her cases, could not be reached 
for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Tuesday, Roland Corado, a witness to the fatal accident, said 
David and Janine Jaggs were thrown from their motorcycle and as they were 
dragged by Giunta's truck, Jaggs "was twisted like a pretzel."

RTD TURNS UP HEAT ON BUSES WITH A NEW SHOW OF FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: HEAVILY ARMED PATROLS RIDE ALONG IN A STEPPED-UP EFFORT TO REDUCE 
GRAFFITI, DRINKING AND UNRULY BEHAVIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Wearing bulletproof vests and belts loaded with pistols, 30 rounds of 
ammunition, nightsticks and Mace, 22 transit police from the RTD's new 
uniformed patrol took to the San Fernando Valley's buses Tuesday to stamp out 
graffiti, boisterous behavior, and eating and drinking on board. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't underestimate people -- you just never know what's going to happen," 
said RTD Officer Frank Higuera, referring to his chest armor and the arsenal of 
weaponry strapped to his waist. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our problems are minor, but you're on a bus, near a lot of people, and 
somebody could stab you, shove you or throw something at you." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the image of battle readiness presented by the officers, transit 
officials at a Sherman Oaks news conference called to publicize the new patrols 
were eager to reassure the 150,000 daily bus riders in the Valley that the 
buses are safe. 
</P>
<P>
The uniformed patrols, part of a countywide program that began downtown in 
August, were extended to the Valley to encourage public confidence, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for peace of mind," said RTD Board President Nikolas Patsaouras, adding 
that riders are generally unaware that the agency has 125 police officers who 
have the same powers as other peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
Some ride the buses in plain clothes, but "the high visibility of uniformed 
officers is to let people know who the transit police are," Patsaouras said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,374 crimes reported to transit officials last year, only about 40 -- 
or 3% -- occurred in the Valley, RTD Police Chief Sharon Papa said. 
</P>
<P>
The most common problems in the Valley -- graffiti, eating and drinking on the 
bus and rowdy schoolchildren who sometimes frighten the elderly -- are minor 
compared to those in such places as South-Central, where fights and robberies 
are far more prevalent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials said they are able to provide uniformed patrols aboard buses 
without reducing the capability of transit police to 
</P>
<P>
respond to emergency calls for help from bus drivers, who are equipped with 
radios and a silent alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD Police Department has doubled in size in recent years because the 
agency hired more police in anticipation of providing security on the new "blue 
line" light rail system between downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But RTD directors wound up contracting with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department to patrol the rail line, freeing officers for other assignments. 
Papa said RTD police will probably replace the deputies when the contract 
expires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some transit officers will ride buses throughout the county, 
not just the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Officers work in three-member teams, with one riding in a "chase" car and two 
on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"I transferred up here to the Valley because it's safer, but I'm still glad to 
see the officers," said John H. Johnson, a driver on Route 234 between Sherman 
Oaks and Sylmar on Tuesday morning. "I don't mess with the kids when they start 
painting graffiti -- they usually keep some kind of weapon in their pocket." 
</P>
<P>
One of his passengers, Jane Gallagher, 47, of Van Nuys, said: "It's nice to get 
on a bus and see police officers because you know the other passengers aren't 
going to start any garbage." 
</P>
<P>
But another passenger, Mary Thomas, 49, of Van Nuys, who said she is disabled, 
seemed somewhat dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a good driver and I have the sense to know it and ride the bus," said 
Thomas, pointing at Higuera and his partner. "But, I ask you -- are things so 
bad that we need them? If so, let me off the bus."

DODGER APOLOGIZES TO S.D. BUSINESSMEN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BUT THE TWO WHO WERE THROWN OUT OF A GAME BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED 
RACIAL SLUR WANT AN APOLOGY FROM THE PADRES OR THEY MAY SEEK LEGAL ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A local businessman, ejected from a San Diego Padres' game after a 
controversial incident in June, said Tuesday that he has received a written 
apology from the Los Angeles Dodgers' outfielder who initially accused him of 
making a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Michael Alessio, who, with fellow businessman Phil Palisoul, was 
ejected from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium after Dodgers' Manager Tom Lasorda 
complained to security guards, said the matter is far from closed. 
</P>
<P>
Alessio said he may still take legal action against the Padres for their 
handling of the incident, which he said left him publicly humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have my legal options, which include a possible suit against the 
Padres," he said. "However, I won't be suing Hubie Brooks (the Dodgers' 
outfielder involved in the controversy). He was very nice in that apology." 
</P>
<P>
Alessio, as well as his attorney, Lionel P. (Chip) Hernholm, said they won't be 
satisfied until the Padres issue a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
Padres' President Dick Freeman said Tuesday that he was "sorry the incident 
occurred," but beyond that, declined comment. Freeman said he had written a 
letter to Alessio outlining his position, which Hernholm called unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The incident in question occurred in the eighth inning of a 2-1 Padres' victory 
on June 10. Brooks told Lasorda and a security guard on duty in the Dodgers' 
dugout that among the derisive taunts yelled at him throughout the game was a 
racial slur -- which Alessio and Palisoul have heatedly denied. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Brooks and Lasorda yelled back an angry retort, Alessio said that 
he and Palisoul were taken to a "cage" beneath the stadium. One cage was 
labeled "ejection," Alessio said, and the other "detox." 
</P>
<P>
He said they were escorted by guards for the Chula Vista firm of Pro-Tect 
Professional Services, which handles security for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept us in there about five minutes," Palisoul said, "and then escorted 
us out of the stadium. He (the security guard) said if we came back in we would 
be in violation of municipal law. So, we waited outside . . . for our boys." 
</P>
<P>
Alessio said the most embarrassing aspect of the incident to both him and 
Palisoul was having been separated from their 11- and 12-year-old sons, who 
remained in the stands with a friend -- attorney Hernholm -- until the game was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Palisoul said the boys play on Little League teams, and throughout the game, 
they and their fathers were surprised by the crude language and gestures 
exhibited by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"All during the game, we engaged in what I would call harmless chiding or 
heckling of the players," Palisoul said. "But it was not obscene or anything. 
You know, it was just stuff you would do to the opposing team. There was 
nothing that you could even remotely construe as a racial slur. That was the 
furthest thing from anything that was said. 
</P>
<P>
"The final thing that caused the blowup -- that caused Lasorda to blow up -- 
was that, after Brooks popped up (in the 8th inning), I said, 'Nice hit, 
Hubie,' and then he said something to me. Well, then, Lasorda jumped out and 
started screaming at me, and it was very profane stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Geez, you're a little tense, aren't you?,' and then he got the guard 
and came out and pointed at me and Mike Alessio. But racial slur? That was 
patently untrue." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Ron Roberts, who was sitting with Alessio and Palisoul behind 
the Dodgers' dugout when the incident occurred, said afterward: "Those men did 
absolutely nothing wrong, and I say that without qualification." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said that "nothing even remotely resembling a racial slur" was said to 
Brooks, who, three days later in an interview with The Times, stopped short of 
saying that he had been the object of a racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy (Palisoul) was saying a whole bunch of stuff," Brooks said at the 
time. "He was hassling everybody the whole game. I may have heard a racial slur 
in there, but it was a lot of other things. He was getting on everybody. I just 
wanted him to stop bothering me." 
</P>
<P>
"Hubie said this guy was getting on him, so I just told the guard to tell this 
guy to stop bothering my player," Lasorda said at the time. "All I did was ask 
the guard to tell him to lay off my guy." 
</P>
<P>
But in his letter, copies of which were made available Tuesday, Brooks said 
that he "cannot conclusively state" that he "either observed or heard" Alessio 
or anyone in his party "make comments of a racially disparaging or 'racial slur 
type' nature." 
</P>
<P>
"Please be advised that I apologize for any embarrassment or inconvenience 
either of you may have incurred by reason of the unfortunate incident . . . ," 
the letter reads. "I regret and apologize for the fact that as a result of my 
accusations against you and those in your party, the two of you were ejected 
from the . . . game. I regret any emotional injury or injury to reputation and 
good standing sustained by either of you as a result of this incident." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Hernholm said the most striking aspect of the story to him was the 
"quickness and sensitivity" with which the Dodgers' management responded to his 
complaint, as opposed to the Padres' "overwhelming lack of concern and 
consideration for Mr. Alessio as a fan." 
</P>
<P>
Hernholm said he was contacted by the Dodgers' in-house attorney, who 
"explored" the matter with Brooks' agent and attorney, the outcome being the 
written apology. 
</P>
<P>
"They said that Mr. Brooks was fully prepared to sign any retraction, any 
apology, and above all, did not want the matter to go to trial," Hernholm said. 
"Whereas, the Padres' response, or non-response, was exaggerated or further 
demonstrated by the quick response made by the Dodgers. The Dodgers jumped 
right on it, but the Padres have done nothing more than issue self-serving 
statements that don't come close to matching an apology." 
</P>
<P>
Hernholm said that it was "even more unusual" that a "prominent citizen" such 
as Alessio, a GOP contributor and delegate to the 1988 Republican Convention, 
"would be treated in such a shoddy and disrespectful manner." 
</P>
<P>
Hernholm said that Alessio owns Padres' season tickets, behind the visiting 
team's dugout, as well as a stadium sky box, which he uses for both baseball 
and football games. 
</P>
<P>
Hernholm said the Padres' recent change in ownership had not made a difference 
in Alessio's case, since the Tom Werner group that bought the franchise from 
Joan Kroc had investigated the incident "as a board matter" and decided that no 
apology was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Hernholm said Dick Freeman's position is "that we're not going to get an 
apology or any admission that anything done was wrong. They said they were 
willing to tell Mike they were sorry the incident happened -- which they have 
done -- and to invite him to lunch, but other than that, nothing. It's 
ridiculous, and it isn't over."

D.A. REOPENS INVESTIGATION OF REPORTED PATIENT RAPE; 
</P>
<P>
DNA: THE DECISION IS BASED ON ADVANCES IN IDENTIFYING ATTACKERS BY GENETIC 
FINGERPRINTING. IT FOLLOWS A CIVIL AWARD MADE TO THE ALLEGED VICTIM.

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Tuesday that it has 
reopened its investigation into the alleged rape of a female patient by a male 
nurse at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Woodland Hills three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after a civil arbitration panel last week awarded 
Deborah and Bruce Haywood $225,000 in damages stemming from the alleged attack 
in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said it decided to re-examine the case because 
of advances in DNA testing that make it possible to identify rapists based on 
the "genetic fingerprints" left behind in their semen or blood. In September, 
1989, a Ventura woman became the first person in California to be convicted 
with the aid of genetic evidence when a jury found her guilty of stabbing a man 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
However, a decision on whether to refile criminal charges against the nurse, 
Steven P. Coyle, has not been made, said Sandi Gibbons, district attorney 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Permanente and Coyle have maintained from the beginning that no rape 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The charges originally filed against Coyle were dropped because of lack of 
evidence, officials said. Unsuccessful in persuading police to conduct DNA 
tests on Coyle's blood, the couple pursued its own investigation, only to be 
told the tests could not be performed because one semen sample was too small 
and the other had been improperly stored, said the couple's attorney, Jerome 
Zamos. 
</P>
<P>
The couple then paid nearly $20,000 for a second, less precise test known as a 
polymerized chain reaction. That test found only that Coyle had the gene type 
detected in the semen samples, according to the private lab that conducted the 
analysis. However, 7% of the white male population has that gene type, which 
Zamos said led to rejection of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
Zamos said Tuesday that the results of polymerized chain reaction tests were 
recently introduced as evidence in a rape case in Riverside County and are 
being considered as evidence in other rape cases. 
</P>
<P>
The Haywoods announced Monday that they intend to pursue a civil lawsuit 
against the hospital seeking $5 million to $6 million in damages.

OXNARD ADOPTS MOST OF GROWTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than four years of consideration and revision, the Oxnard City 
Council adopted most of its controversial 30-year General Plan on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The five council members voted unanimously to approve 10 of the 11 components 
of the so-called 2020 General Plan, designed to guide development in the city 
for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that after four and a half years, we're finally buttoning it 
down," Mayor Nao Takasugi said. 
</P>
<P>
The city still must adopt the portion of the plan that deals with, among other 
things, how much housing will be set aside for low-income families. The 
decision was postponed to allow City Manager Vernon Hazen a chance to meet with 
a group called Via Campesina, which has said the plan does not provide enough 
low-income and farm-worker housing. 
</P>
<P>
The 2020 General Plan allows the city to add 12,462 housing units in the next 
30 years. The population is expected to increase from 127,721 (estimated in 
January, 1989) to 165,000. 
</P>
<P>
It also allows an additional 416 acres to be devoted to commercial development, 
1,675 acres to industrial development and 229 acres to open space. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there's been a lot of controversy over growth and no-growth," 
Councilwoman Gerry Furr said. "I feel we have a very good monitoring system 
that will keep us from overdoing it." 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to keep track of growth through measures such as an annual 
report to keep the council apprised of the pace of development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the early debate over the General Plan focused on Ormond Beach, an area 
in the southwest corner of the city that includes some of the last undeveloped 
beachfront in the county. It also includes sensitive wetlands that for years 
have coexisted with nearby heavy industry and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided last week to restore two miles of blighted beachfront, 
preserve about 131 acres of wetlands and allow construction of 4,100 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Council members are scheduled to discuss the rest of the plan Tuesday.

NEIGHBORHOOD UNITES TO FIGHT DWP ELECTRIC FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of a working-class Arleta neighborhood have banded together over the 
years to fend off urban problems by painting over graffiti, cleaning up street 
trash, planting trees and forming crime watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
But now they fear they will be on the losing side of a months-long dispute with 
the Department of Water and Power, which has proposed construction of an 
$8.5-million electrical distribution station on Branford Street, smack in the 
middle of their neighborhood of small, neatly kept homes. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the proposed facility, which would be unstaffed and housed 
behind a 16-foot wall, will become a neighborhood nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
They fear that the high walls will provide cover for loiterers and drug dealers 
and a clean canvas for graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they resent it that their quiet neighborhood must carry the burden for 
the booming residential and commercial development in surrounding east San 
Fernando Valley communities that increased electrical demand 20% during the 
1980s, creating the need for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, we happen to be a strong community of homes and feel this 
facility is entirely out of place in the middle of our neighborhood," said Joe 
Bonilla, an Arleta resident and member of the Arleta Chamber of Commerce. "I 
think the DWP was surprised that we even had a community association and care 
about the character of our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
In August, the DWP took out an option to buy two homes along the 13200 block of 
Branford Street. 
</P>
<P>
If the zoning and building permits are approved, construction would begin in 
December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, with the support of Councilman Ernani Bernardi, have urged DWP 
officials to locate the station on nearby department-owned land beneath power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice residential area and I don't want it disturbed," Bernardi said 
Tuesday. "We are in the middle of discussion with the DWP and no decisions have 
been made. I'm still asking questions to find out whether this is the best 
location." 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said the Branford site is the No. 1 location because it is in the 
center of the service area. The station would take in high-voltage power and 
transform it into lower amounts that would be carried to 15,000 to 20,000 homes 
and businesses in Arleta and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Without the new station, residents and businesses in the area would eventually 
suffer from periodic power outages because overburdened equipment would be more 
prone to failure, said Joe Thompson, DWP manager of substation design. 
</P>
<P>
He said his staff studied six other nearby sites for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Placing it outside the neighborhood would mean placing it far from the center 
of the service area," Thompson said. "It would not be efficient. Transmission 
lines would be longer and more energy would be lost in the transmission." 
</P>
<P>
But longtime residents like Karen Zuccolillo, 47, and Cecilia Munoz, 67, say 
they can predict all too well what will happen to the blank walls and vacant 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Graffiti. Vagrants. Can you see it any other way?" said Zuccolillo, a mother 
of three, whose house is located across a wash that is adjacent to the proposed 
station. "I get this feeling, though, that we can't stop it. Their minds have 
been made up." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, a 23-year resident, fears that "bums will hang around the building." 
</P>
<P>
In response to neighborhood concern, DWP officials met with a small group of 
residents to further explain details of the site-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said it would cost up to $2 million more to build a new station at two 
alternate sites near Sheldon Street that were suggested by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
A communitywide meeting is scheduled for Oct. 17 at Vena Avenue Elementary 
School auditorium in Arleta. Zuccolillo and others at the meeting are part of 
an informal neighborhood group that paints over graffiti and notifies police 
when abandoned vehicles are found. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, to prevent drug dealers from evading police by running 
through Branford Park one block away, residents successfully pushed city 
officials to erect a chain-link fence around the park. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said the station will be well maintained and landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that if neighbors are concerned about graffiti and crime a 
private security company could possibly be hired to periodically patrol the 
site and DWP crews would paint over graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a good neighbor," he said.

MEMORIAL SERVICE TO BE HELD FOR MCCREERY, EX-PRESIDENT OF ROHR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private memorial service is planned for Frank E. McCreery, a former president 
and vice chairman of Rohr Industries in Chula Vista. McCreery, a Poway 
resident, died Sunday at Alvarado Hospital Medical Center of natural causes. He 
was 72. 
</P>
<P>
McCreery, born in Pennsylvania, was graduated from the California Institute of 
Technology in 1939 with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
He worked briefly as an engineer for Ryan Aeronautical Co. before joining Rohr 
Industries as assistant chief engineer. He was employed by the company Aug. 26, 
1940, 20 days after the company was incorporated, said company spokesman Roger 
Renstrom. 
</P>
<P>
McCreery was a member of the company's "Eighth and J Gang" of people employed 
at the company's first plant at Eighth and J streets, Renstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
McCreery, who retired in 1976, joined the company in celebrating its 50th 
anniversary Aug. 6, and in its growth from a handful of workers to 11,600 
employees today, he said. The company designs and manufactures aircraft engine 
nacelle systems, or casings, for commercial, military and business aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"(McCreery) displayed courage, vision, and determination as one of the Rohr 
pioneers and executives, and he will be missed," said Robert H. Goldsmith, 
Rohr's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
McCreery served as a member of the company's board of directors from 1965 to 
1976, as president from 1970 to 1974 and vice chairman from 1973 to 1976. 
During his 36 years with the company, he also was executive chief engineer, 
vice president of engineering, vice president of manufacturing, senior vice 
president and executive vice president. He became a corporate officer in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
McCreery was an officer of the Aerospace Industries Assn. and the Society of 
Automotive Engineers, and a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics. He was also a supporter of the Boy Scouts and an avid golfer. 
</P>
<P>
McCreery is survived by his wife, Ruth; sons James (Kallee) McCreery and 
Douglas McCreery, both of Escondido, and Michael McCreery of San Diego; 
daughter Maureen Nicks of San Diego; brother Jack McCreery of San Luis Obispo; 
four grandchildren, and one great-grandson.

CHAMBER ON RIGHT COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You recently published an article regarding the proposed golf course in the Big 
Tujunga Wash area. The article reported that the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of 
Commerce supported the plan, but that the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents 
opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
One of their groundless fears is increased traffic. Assuming maximum 
utilization, with golf foursomes starting at 10-minute intervals from 6 a.m. to 
6 p.m., the total number of golfers would equal 288, and obviously they would 
not all arrive or leave at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident whose home is directly above the golf course site, I agree with 
the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
We have seen floods, people dumping trash, people shooting the wildlife, and 
infrequently a horse rider or a hiker. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course would protect the environment and preserve the wildlife and the 
plant life while protecting the community against floods.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who worked as a live-in nurse at the homes of elderly people in North 
County pleaded guilty Tuesday to one felony count of stealing from one of her 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Veronica Underwood, 39, pleaded guilty to one count of grand theft in a 
plea bargain that saw another count dropped. 
</P>
<P>
She made her plea before Municipal Judge Michael B. Orfield, who set a 
sentencing hearing for Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the district attorney's office will not oppose a request 
that Underwood be sentenced to one year in custody. However, Underwood may face 
an additional sentence because she is scheduled to go on trial for another 
grand theft charge on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood admitted to stealing from a couple who employed her as a home 
health-care nurse in their Encinitas home during April. Underwood stole credit 
cards in order to make unauthorized purchases, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Mary E. Grove.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chula Vista woman surrendered without incident to SWAT officers early Tuesday 
after an all-night standoff that involved the death of one man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the woman and the dead man were being withheld pending 
notification of next of kin, Lt. Dean Girdner of the Chula Vista Police 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed the man and woman lived together in the apartment at 1450 
Melrose where the standoff occurred, Girdner said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the apartment about 9:30 p.m. Monday to investigate a 
report of shots being fired, Girdner said. When they arrived, a woman pointed a 
rifle out her window and fired a couple of random shots, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked off the area and called in a SWAT team and hostage negotiator, 
Girdner said. For several hours, negotiators used a bullhorn to communicate 
with the woman because there was no telephone in the apartment, Girdner said. 
</P>
<P>
About 5 a.m., two rounds of tear gas were shot into the woman's apartment and 
she surrendered a short time later without incident, Girdner said. In the 
living room lying on the couch, police found the body of a man who had been 
shot more than once, Girdner said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was taken to the County Jail at Las Colinas.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN TRIAL OF REFUGEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection began Tuesday in the murder trial of an Estonian refugee accused 
of beating and stabbing to death activist Viivi Piirisild in her North 
Hollywood house in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the selection process in the case against Tauno Waidla should 
take about two weeks, after which attorneys will begin to present evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Waidla, who faces the death penalty if convicted, admitted the killing to 
police a month after it was committed, according to court documents. But his 
attorney, Martin R. Gladstein, has said he will seek to have the statement 
thrown out because detectives did not honor Waidla's request to have an 
attorney present during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Waidla and Peter Sakarias, who also is accused in the killing, were hailed as 
heroes after they deserted the Soviet army and escaped to West Germany. 
Sakarias has been judged mentally incompetent to stand trial and has been sent 
to Atascadero State Hospital.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH WINDS LED TO DROWNING OF 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Waves caused by high winds are being blamed for the deaths of two men who 
drowned Sunday in Castaic Lake when their fishing boat was swamped, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak accident," said Mike Hargett, park superintendent at Castaic 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 1-1 1/2 foot swells caused by winds blowing 15-25 m.p.h. . . . If it 
was not windy, it's very unlikely they would have taken a wave over the bow." 
</P>
<P>
Leo Lenore, 50, and William Bunch, 17, both of Pasadena, disappeared in an area 
of the lake estimated to be 175 to 225 feet deep, said Lt. Jeff Springs of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The bodies have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
The victims and two other men had been fishing for at least four hours Sunday 
when a strong wave hit their boat about 4:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that they went bow first into a wave and it came over the boat 
filling it with water and causing all on board to fall overboard," Hargett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was witnessed by a guard at the lake's lifeguard headquarters who 
notified a rescue boat by radio. The boat arrived in three to five minutes but 
the two victims could not be found, Hargett said. Lifeguards rescued Ronnie 
Williams, 27, of Altadena and Derrick Potts, 31, of Duarte, who had also been 
on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
"They were fully conscious when we pulled them out," Hargett said. "Both of 
them were holding on to the side of the swamped boat." The two survivors did 
not require hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Hargett said the men were not wearing flotation vests. "State law does not 
require anyone to wear them," he said.

WOO WANTS GROWTH PLAN FOR VENTURA BOULEVARD TO BE TOUGHER ON DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo on Tuesday restated his ideas for 
making a growth-control plan for Ventura Boulevard tougher on developers as the 
council's planning committee delayed for another week a public hearing on the 
massive and complex plan. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he wants the Ventura Boulevard specific plan, the long-awaited 
strategy for limiting commercial development along the thoroughfare known as 
the San Fernando Valley's "Main Street," to grant far greater power to the 
city's Department of Transportation to scale down projects. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, DOT is authorized to reduce individual projects if it 
finds that 12 out of 30 critical intersections along the boulevard have reached 
so-called "F-levels" of traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Transit planners use a rating scale to categorize congestion levels; F, the 
worst level, describes congestion at an intersection that's so bad it affects 
adjoining intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he was unhappy with the plan's current proposed grant of authority to 
DOT planners. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Woo may want DOT empowered to cut development if fewer 
intersections are gridlocked, said Eric Roth, a top aide to Woo, who represents 
parts of Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Woo said during Tuesday's Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee meeting that he wants a moratorium on the issuance of any building 
permits within the Ventura Boulevard corridor for a period of 90 days after the 
council approves the specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
Such a ban would give city planning and building officials time to become fully 
acquainted with the intricacies of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Woo has previously expressed concern that the plan might be so difficult to 
interpret that city officials might mistakenly grant developers building 
allowances exceeding what is actually permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who sits on the planning committee, has previously endorsed these two 
ideas for strengthening the plan. 
</P>
<P>
No vote was taken on either of Woo's proposals, and none is expected until next 
week at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
The carry-over for another week of the committee's consideration of the plan 
was urged by the city attorney's office, which reported that only three of the 
seven city departments that were asked to comment on the plan had done so. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, committee chairman, said the city attorney's office 
should warn the non-responsive departments that if they do not provide their 
comments by the next meeting their silence would be interpreted as approval of

AKEEM KNOCKS OUT MIJARES IN FIRST 
</P>

Kid Akeem retained his North American Boxing Federation super flyweight title 
with a first-round knockout ofRicardo Mijares of Mexico City before 1,200 fans 
at the Sports Arena Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem (21-0), ranked third by the World Boxing Council, floored Mijares with an 
overhand right at 1:37 of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem, a native of Nigeria who fights out of Las Vegas, set up the right hand 
with a left jab. Mijares finally staggered to his feet at the count of 10, but 
he couldn't stand up straight and the referee stopped the bout. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can beat him," said Billy Baxter, Akeem's manager. "We've been having 
trouble finding anyone to fight him." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of Akeem's victories have come by knockout. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in his career he wasn't knocking anyone out, but now that's all he does. 
That's how Sugar Ray Leonard was too," Baxter said of Akeem, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Mijares (29-6), who had never boxed outside Mexico, fought for the Mexican 
flyweight championship last year, but lost a decision to Willy Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem's handspeed edge was evident early and it appeared Mijares never saw 
Akeem's right hand coming. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of the two main events, NABF flyweight champion Isaias Zamudio of 
Blythe (20-3, eight knockouts) won a unanimous 10-round decision over Jose 
Herrera of Mexicali (16-5, 14 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Zamudio's third over Herrera in three fights. All of Zamudio's 
victories have come by decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera was the aggressor throughout the fight, but Zamudio's crisp 
counterpunching attack gave him nearly every round -- one judge had Zamudio 
winning all 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Zamudio seemed to have an answer for everything Herrera threw, and then he 
usually came back with a combination of short, quick punches that scored to 
Herrera's head. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera landed some solid left hooks to Zamudio's jaw several times, but they 
didn't seem faze Zamudio. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Zamudio, ranked 16th by the World Boxing Assn., won a close 
10-round decision from Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, Nisael Espino (2-3-1) of Tijuana won a unanimous four-round 
decision over Rickey Bynum (2-1-1) of Pensacola, Fla. in a battle of super 
lightweights. Super middleweight Ricky Simms (4-3) of Rancho Cucamonga stopped 
Jessie Lanton (11-4) of Pensacola at 2:25 of the first round. The referee ended 
the bout after a left uppercut dropped Lanton for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
In the first bout, light-heavyweight Billy Lewis of Pensacola raised his record 
to 9-0 with a six-round split decision victory over Abel Asinamali (1-2-1) of 
Westminster.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: KEDER, DOUGHERTY TO TRY OUT WITH SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Major Soccer League season nine days away, the Sockers continue to 
audition free agents for four remaining roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Keder, who scored 28 goals while playing 36 games for the Sockers 
during the 1987-88 season, arrived Tuesday, according to President Ron Cady. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Paul Dougherty will show up today, Coach Ron Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty played three seasons with the Sockers before going to Baltimore as a 
free agent last year. His best year was in 1987-88, when he was second on the 
team in goals (40) and assists (24). 
</P>
<P>
Like Keder, Dougherty's no lock. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me say this," Newman said. "We're not bringing Paul in -- he's bringing 
himself in." 
</P>
<P>
Added Cady, "I don't even know if we want to sign him." 
</P>
<P>
But Newman appeared anxious to get Dougherty in the fold. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul would be a good exciting asset," he said. "He has experience (four years 
in the MSL), and we need experienced players." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty severed his ties with Baltimore when he decided to go back to outdoor 
soccer in his native England. He has since cooled on that idea, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
In other news, the Sockers have ended talks with free-agent midfielder Michael 
Collins, Newman said. Also, Cady said the team may reopen talks with midfielder 
Jacques Ladouceur. Ladouceur, one of only two players to play in all 52 games 
last year, was offered a contract before training camp, but refused to sign, 
saying it was too low of an offer. JOHN GEIS

The Padres announced Tuesday that they will increase ticket prices for all 
seats for the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
All reserved seats will be increased by $1.50 and general admission tickets 
will be increased by $1. 
</P>
<P>
"Padres tickets will continue to be among the lowest priced in major league 
baseball, with 18 of the 26 ball clubs charging prices equal to, or higher 
than, the Padres for their best seats," club President Dick Freeman said in a 
statement. "A 1990 study shows that the total cost of attending a Padre game 
was the third lowest of any major league team. We will continue to be among the 
lowest in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in five seasons the Padres have increased ticket 
prices. SCOTT MILLER

SAN DIEGO COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: SUWARA PRAISES JAPANESE COUNTERPART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, before winning his 400th match as San Diego State's women's 
volleyball coach, Rudy Suwara made a point to praise the university and his 
former and current players. He also spoke fondly of Akio Yamagishi, a friend 
and coach of Nihon University in Japan (enrollment 80,000), who spent the past 
six months at SDSU on sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
Suwara said Yamagishi was here to compare the status of sport in the U.S. with 
that in Japan. He also found time to help out the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Suwara: "One day at practice, he served about 400 or 500 balls to the 
girls. Boom. Boom. Boom. One after the other, he never missed. Finally, after 
about 25 minutes, he missed one, and he started yelling at himself. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of standard he set for himself." 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Yamagishi was goofing off and bragged that he could set a 
ball into a basketball hoop about 25 feet away. The players called his bluff, 
but Yamagishi sank one as smooth as a Bo Kimble three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
"After that," Suwara said, "I told the girls on the team, 'All coaches can do 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Suwara said he will miss having Yamagishi around, but another Japanese coach, 
Toshi Yoshida, arrived last month for a sabbatical of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida, coach of Tokyo Gakugei University in Japan, will be at SDSU for nine 
months to study sports psychology and work with the Aztecs and the U.S. 
national team. Yoshida was an assistant for the U.S. women's team in 1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene's women's volleyball team, which has improved in each of 
the past four years, enjoying what could turn out to be its best season ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders won 10, 11, 12 and 14 matches the past four years and are off to 
a 16-5 start this year, including a 6-0 mark in the Golden State Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, PLNC defeated Fresno Pacific and Azusa Pacific, then ranked 
fifth and 15th, respectively, in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics. PLNC is now ranked 15th, but faces a tough test tonight at 7 at UC 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Also in women's volleyball, the University of San Diego is off to its best 
start under new Coach Sue Hegerle-Snyder. The Toreras are 9-10, a big 
improvement over last year's 2-26 mark, and have a three-game winning streak, 
their longest since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont, coached by Colleen Suwara, Rudy's wife, is ranked second among 
California community colleges. The Griffins are the defending state champions. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC's men's cross-country team, ranked 11th in the NAIA, will try to defend 
its GSAC championship Saturday at Bonelli Park in Covina. Last year, the 
Crusaders' Goshu Tadese, Gus Arce and Rick Penman finished one-two-three to win 
the title. Tadese is redshirting this year, but Arce, Penman and senior Sean 
O'Hara are back. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC's chances will be enhanced if Marcello Bengoechen of Brazil is cleared to 
participate. Bengoechen is still awaiting eligibility papers from Brazil. 
Robert Keter of Kenya had a similar problem cleared up last week. 
</P>
<P>
With Anette Ronnerman and Vanessa Couch running well, PLNC also figures to 
challenge for the women's title. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-area community college football teams went 0-5 for the third 
consecutive week Saturday. Combined, they have won only three of 25 games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
It's odd enough to think that the college basketball season is around the 
corner -- teams are allowed to begin practicing Monday -- but Arizona is 
sending its baseball team to USD for a doubleheader Oct. 21.

2 OVERTIME GOALS HELP ROYAL KEEP MARMONTE STREAK ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Students at Royal High counted down the final 10 seconds. They rose from their 
seats to cheer what appeared to be Royal's 42nd consecutive Marmonte League 
water polo victory. 
</P>
<P>
But Agoura's Kevin Driscoll threatened to put an end to all that, scoring with 
a second to play to tie the score, 5-5, and force the match into overtime. The 
celebration, however, was only delayed, not canceled, as Chad Hood and Chad 
Templeton scored in overtime to give the Highlanders a 7-5 win. 
</P>
<P>
"After that goal, we said in the huddle, 'Let's find a way to win this thing,' 
" Royal Coach Steve Snyder said. "It doesn't matter who it is, we had to do 
something because the normal ways weren't working." 
</P>
<P>
Hood's high shot over Agoura goalie Hooshie Broomand in the first overtime 
period put Royal ahead to stay. Templeton added an insurance goal in the second 
overtime period for the Highlanders (12-3, 3-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
"It was a smart shot by Hood," Agoura Coach Mike Mulligan said. "Our goalie 
came out of the net and he flicked it over his head. The goalie shouldn't have 
come out; Hood took advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Hood: "The goalies always come out when you get in close. I threw it high 
trying to get a shot or a pass and I put it right over his head." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (10-4, 2-1) got three goals from Driscoll and two from Jason Stelle. 
Royal countered with two goals from Hood and Jack Kocur. Templeton, Will 
Spencer and Mike Radka also added goals for the Highlanders.

Sherdrick Bonner of Cal State Northridge has been selected Western Football 
Conference offensive player of the week after passing for 233 yards and 
accounting for both Matador touchdowns in a 19-18 win over Portland State.

</P>
<P>
The previous week, Bonner completed only 10 of 26 for 63 yards in a 14-10

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MAKING A SIZABLE IMPACT; 
</P>
<P>
DIMINUTIVE NORTH HOLLYWOOD BACK RECEIVING HIGH MARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many would say that Leon Gable is just too small to be an effective running 
back. 
</P>
<P>
But the 5-foot-5, 142-pound North Hollywood High senior tailback constantly is 
proving his skeptics wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Gable rushed for 327 yards in 24 carries and scored five touchdowns in North 
Hollywood's 40-6 win over Van Nuys last week although he was pulled with five 
minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know that (about the 300-yard game) until a reporter told me," 
Gable said. "I thought I had about 200, 230 or so. When he told me 300, I was 
like, 'Coach, let me go back in so I can run for 400. I want to break records.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Gable's 327-yard game isn't North Hollywood's top mark, but his five touchdowns 
leave him tied with the Huskies' last top running back, Chip Grant. Grant, who 
owns the school record for most yards in a game with 352, scored five 
touchdowns in three games his senior year (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Grant, another scaled-down North Hollywood running back, is playing tailback 
for Santa Monica College but left his legacy behind as motivation. Gable 
answered the call. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, just a few months after Grant had completed his senior 
season, North Hollywood Coach Fred Grimes met Gable for the first time. Grimes 
was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He would wear his little bandannas, and he'd wear his pants down around his 
thighs," said Grimes, recalling Gable's cocky, defiant style. "He looked like 
anything but an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"(Gable) walked up to me and said, 'Grimes, I'm going to be your next Chip 
Grant,' and I looked at him and I just said, 'Get out of here.' I didn't even 
know who (Gable) was," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Gable didn't show up for spring ball that year and Grimes wonders now if he 
scared him off. Gable opted to play a final year with his friends in a Pop 
Warner league, where he had been playing since age 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hanging around with the fellas," Gable said. "I was more of a hang-out 
person than a player. But then I changed. It was time to wake up and play with 
the big fellas." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Gable sustained an ankle injury in his first carry of his first 
high school game. After a three-game layoff, he returned to gain 1,081 yards in 
158 carries with 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
After three games this season, Gable is averaging nearly eight yards a carry. 
He has 557 yards in 70 carries and 10 touchdowns. His most memorable score came 
on the last play of the team's opener against Palisades when he raced 67 yards 
-- maintaining his balance at one point by touching his hand to the ground -- 
to lift the Huskies to a 31-26 victory. Earlier in the game, he returned a 
kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Expect more from me," he said with a determined face. "I am out to gain 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Gable's goal is to gain more yards than Kennedy running back Ontiwaun Carter, 
who led City Section runners in the Valley last season with 1,563 yards in 11 
games. Carter has rushed for 512 yards in 92 carries and scored nine 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Ontiwaun Carter that I am going to be the leader, the king of the 
Valley now," said Gable, friends with Carter since their Pop Warner days. " 
'I'm taking your place,' and he said, 'Naw, I own (the Valley).' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Gable wishes he were 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, he believes his size helps 
him avoid tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't see me when I am behind the line; and when I get past the line, 
they can see me, but it's hard to catch me," said Gable, who said he was timed 
in 4.4 seconds for the 40-yard dash. "Once I see open field, I am looking for 
one thing -- and that's a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
Gable is quick to credit the offensive line for his accomplishments, giving the 
Husky linemen an appropriate nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do anything without the dogs -- they're my linemen. Van Nuys wasn't as 
big as the guys from San Pedro or Palisades, so (the dogs) just took it to 
them. They opened holes so big that a big truck could roll through them. I am a 
little corvette, so I just roll right by them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gable is well aware of his limitations as a collegiate running back, but hopes 
to earn a spot as a kick returner, probably at a junior college. Junior college 
also will meet his academic needs. He has struggled to remain eligible since he 
joined the team but has impressed Grimes with his effort. 
</P>
<P>
"But you are not going to change his spots, he is not a good student," Grimes 
said. "His priorities are other places. But he is certainly on track to 
graduate." 
</P>
<P>
None of Gable's three older brothers are high school graduates, so the small 
kid that comes up with the big plays rates as a pioneer at home. And he 
continues to aim high. 
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to be in the NFL draft, and a Heisman Trophy winner . . . 
everybody dreams I guess," he said.

KERKORIAN AGREES TO PAY $35 MILLION TO SETTLE LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. have agreed 
to pay $35 million to settle a class-action suit filed in connection with the 
1986 sale of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which came as the reclusive Kerkorian was scheduled to take the 
stand in the 1-week-old trial, was tentatively approved by Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. on Tuesday, after both sides expressed 
support for the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition came from four MGM/UA insurance carriers who had already 
reached a separate settlement with shareholders. That settlement would be 
canceled under the new agreement. The insurers, who approved the earlier 
settlement over MGM/UA's objections, argued that they will now be exposed to 
further liability. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, if finally approved Nov. 19, would end four years of often 
rancorous litigation between former MGM/UA shareholders and Kerkorian. It would 
also mean as much as an additional $3 per share for the parties to the suit, 
according to the plaintiffs' attorney, James W. Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Hennigan, Mercer's partner, said the agreement represents a victory 
for stockholders, who initially sought $200 million. "When we look at the 
number of shareholders likely to be represented, we think this is an extremely 
favorable result for the class," Hennigan said. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, MGM/UA said it was forced into the "bad faith" 
settlement by its insurance carriers, which had earlier agreed to pay $8 
million to $20 million for a partial settlement of the suit. Under that 
agreement, all defendants except Kerkorian and Tracinda were absolved of 
liability. MGM/UA filed suit against the insurers as a result of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA declined to say whether the company will pay the $35-million settlement 
on behalf of Kerkorian and Tracinda. But Terry Christensen, Kerkorian's 
attorney, said the company fully expects to recoup the $35 million, plus 
punitive damages, from the insurance companies. Christensen also said MGM/UA 
denies any wrongdoing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit arose from the $1.5-billion sale of MGM/UA to Turner 
Broadcasting Co. Shareholders maintained that Kerkorian undervalued the parent 
company in a plan to reacquire United Artists, and eventually the MGM/UA name, 
at a sweetheart price. MGM/UA maintained that the company negotiated a strong 
deal for its shareholders.

MIDEAST JITTERS VAULT OIL PRICES TO A RECORD HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: FUTURES RISE $1.45 TO CLOSE AT $40.40 A BARREL AFTER A BLOODY CLASH IN 
JERUSALEM AND SABER-RATTLING BY IRAQ.

Oil prices jumped nearly a dollar and a half per barrel to record highs of more 
than $40 a barrel Tuesday as traders reacted to heightened tensions in the 
Middle East after the killing of at least 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem on 
Monday and new threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's calls Tuesday for retaliation against the shootings overwhelmed 
earlier hopes for a diplomatic resolution of the Persian Gulf standoff, driving 
futures prices for crude oil as high as $40.95 a barrel during the day. 
</P>
<P>
It was the highest price for a crude oil futures contract since trading began 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The low for the day was $40.10, equal to the previous record high reached Sept. 
27. The price of crude oil for November delivery ended Tuesday's trading up 
$1.45 from Monday's close -- or $40.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, a record closing price. 
</P>
<P>
On cash markets, where oil is traded for immediate delivery, the commodity was 
even higher Tuesday, with some U.S. and foreign grades being offered at prices 
approaching $42 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
At such levels, some analysts believe, U.S. crude oil is now commanding the 
highest prices ever. Foreign grades of crude have been sold on cash markets at 
prices well above $40 a barrel in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Another $1.50 worth of war premium has worked itself into the market again," 
one futures broker said. The problem is not inadequate world supplies of oil 
but fear of shortages, he added. "There's plenty of oil. The problem is, as 
long as there is a fear of supply disruption, even momentarily, prices will not 
go down." 
</P>
<P>
Prices of refined products also finished higher Tuesday. Unleaded gasoline for 
November delivery was up 4.51 cents a gallon to 98.26 cents. Heating oil for 
November delivery was up 3.19 cents a gallon at $1.0615. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of crude oil for delivery in later months were also up, but those 
increases were limited by exchange rules to $1 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Traders now consider $42 or $42.50 a barrel the next level the market will 
test, perhaps in the next few days, barring unforeseen news. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the increases in part to technical factors but mainly to 
anxieties about the Middle East stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians died Monday when Israeli police shot into a crowd on 
Jerusalem's Temple Mount -- which holds both Judaic and Islamic holy places -- 
after some Palestinian protesters threw rocks at Jews worshipping at the nearby 
Western Wall. Palestinians were protesting reports that a group of 
fundamentalist Jews planned to lay a foundation stone for a new temple on the 
site of one of Islam's holiest shrines, the Dome of the Rock. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fear that, because of this uprising, it may hinder diplomatic 
efforts to end the crisis, and if that's true, the only option left is a 
military solution," said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E. D. &amp; F. Man 
International Futures Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Those fears were compounded Tuesday when Hussein responded to the incident by 
demanding in a message delivered on Baghdad Radio that Israel abandon Arab 
lands. He also said Iraq possessed a new missile that could reach targets 
hundreds of miles away and would strike "when the time of reckoning comes." 
</P>
<P>
Traders were apparently unimpressed with President Bush's reaction, in which he 
chided Israeli security forces but dismissed Hussein's comments. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retail prices for self-serve unleaded gasoline are averaging $1.37 a 
gallon, up 2.4 cents since last week and 29.5 cents a gallon since Aug. 1, the 
day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Automobile Assn. of America reported. 
</P>
<P>
The association's record high for self-serve unleaded is $1.388 per gallon 
before the Easter weekend in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which surveys gasoline prices nationally, said that prices 
were up in all regions of the country but that they rose most in the West and 
least in the Midwest last week.

CARTER HAWLEY POSTS LOSS OF $26 MILLION; WILL CUT STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carter Hawley Hale Stores, trying to turn around its debt-ridden retailing 
empire, said Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its Thalhimers chain to May 
Department Stores for roughly $325 million and that it will slash 1,000 jobs 
from its four other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based retailer, parent of the Broadway-Southern California, 
also provided fresh evidence of why it needs to revitalize: It reported a loss 
of $26 million for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts credited Carter Hawley with taking needed steps to restore its 
financial health and to comfort its suppliers but said the company still 
suffers from weak sales at its department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they will cut about 400 jobs in Southern California 
during the next 12 to 18 months. The other 600 doomed jobs are in the San 
Francisco, Sacramento and Phoenix areas. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Holman, Carter Hawley's senior vice president for operations, said the 
company expects to avoid layoffs and to make all of the reductions -- which 
amount to slightly more than 3% of its work force -- through attrition. Carter 
Hawley employs about 36,500 workers, including 6,500 at Thalhimers, 
headquartered in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Holman said the eliminated positions will largely include jobs for dock 
workers, stock clerks and middle managers. Administrative jobs will also be cut 
as the company consolidates some office operations after selling Thalhimers, 
Carter Hawley's last chain outside the West. 
</P>
<P>
Some senior executive positions "probably" will be slashed too, but Holman said 
no specific plans have been made on that score. One of the few areas not 
expected to be included in the cuts is the sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
Through its various cutbacks, Carter Hawley hopes to save $35 million a year at 
its four remaining divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Thalhimers deal, on the other hand, was intended to pump fresh funds into 
cash-starved Carter Hawley. The agreement calls for St. Louis-based May, the 
nation's biggest department store company and parent of the May Co. California 
and Robinson's chains in Los Angeles, to pay a base price of $325 million in 
cash for Thalhimers. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley estimates that it could get as much as $15 million more for the 
chain, depending partly on how much it spends at Thalhimers stores by the time 
the deal closes. Officials expect the sale to be completed by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley will use $180 million of the proceeds to pay off debt tied to the 
Thalhimers chain, which operates 26 stores in Virginia, the Carolinas and 
Tennessee. The remaining funds will, among other things, help the company boost 
its store remodeling program from $40 million during the past year to $55 
million annually this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
To get that needed financing, however, Carter Hawley parted with one of its few 
jewels. Thalhimers, which it bought in 1978, is second in performance only to 
Broadway-California among Carter Hawley's chains. With sales of $446 million 
last year, it accounted for nearly 16% of the parent company's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
For May, Thalhimers gives the company its first stores in the Carolinas and 
brings it into other areas where it has few outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it appeared to be a good deal for both sides, with Carter Hawley 
getting crucial funds to remodel some of its badly run-down stores. Chairman 
Philip M. Hawley "had to continue to finance the modernization program or he 
had to find someone to buy the company," said Barre W. Littel of First Boston 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives them a new lease on life," added Edward Weller of Montgomery 
Securities. "It gives them a lot of leeway." 
</P>
<P>
Weller said the sale also allows Carter Hawley to "concentrate on the 
California market, which they know better." 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street didn't universally praise the developments, however. Carter 
Hawley's $350 million in junk bonds climbed Tuesday, but a key bond rating 
agency, Moody's Investors Service, downgraded Carter Hawley's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's said it took the action based, among other things, "on the company's 
increasingly vulnerable share position in the highly competitive California 
market" and "its continuing lackluster operating performance." 
</P>
<P>
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average was off 78.22, Carter Hawley stock fell 37.5 cents to close at $3. 
That's down from $14 in the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were somewhat disappointed with the financial results released 
Tuesday. The $26-million loss for the year, versus profits of $13.5 million a 
year ago, far exceeded the deficit of $2 million to $8 million many had 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley and analysts noted, however, that most of the loss stemmed from a 
so-called non-cash charge -- a $22.2-million accounting adjustment to reflect 
unanticipated inflation and a reduction in the company's inventories. The 
company also took a $16.5-million charge to cover uninsured expenses stemming 
from last year's Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding one-time accounting adjustments and interest payments, Carter 
Hawley's operating earnings fell 0.5% to $172.2 million. Sales for the year 
totaled $2.86 billion, up 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Carter Hawley's loss came in the fourth quarter, when it posted a 
deficit of $25.5 million on flat sales of $623.3 million. In the same quarter a 
year earlier, the company lost $8.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, Carter Hawley's trouble stems from the $350 million in 
junk-bond debt that it took on in 1987 to reorganize and fend off a takeover 
attempt by the Limited and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. Analysts have also faulted 
the company for the poor condition of its stores and the company's lack of a 
clear-cut merchandising strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other chains, Carter Hawley is also being hurt badly by the national 
slowdown in consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley owns Emporium in the Bay Area, Weinstocks in Sacramento and 
Phoenix-based Broadway-Southwest, along with Broadway-Southern California and 
Thalhimers. After the Thalhimers deal, it will have 88 department stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley is credited with taking needed steps to restore its financial 
health, but analysts say the company still suffers from weak sales at its 
department stores.

STRIFE BETWEEN UAL, UNIONS MAY DEEPEN WITH BID'S FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of another failure by employees to buy UAL Corp., parent of United 
Airlines, most observers believe that the company and its unions are headed for 
nasty confrontation and bitter rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be trouble, one way or the other," predicted Stanley 
Aronowitz, a sociology professor who specializes in labor at the graduate 
school of the City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Either there will be a lockout (of the unions)," he said, "or the unions are 
going to have to make large concessions, or UAL will sell out to another 
company on the grounds that it cannot remain competitive with such high labor 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
Aronowitz said he believes that UAL Corp. was acting in bad faith throughout 
the union-led takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"The corporation was . . . playing a game to enter into negotiations with the 
unions as a means of wringing concessions," he said. "The deal did not work, so 
now you (the unions) will have to give back more benefits and wages and make 
other concessions. That is the next step." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph R. Blasi, professor in the Institute of Management and Labor Relations 
at Rutgers University, said he expects a "battle royal between labor and 
management." 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman and chief executive, "wants 
to turn the employees from investors back into simple workers, and he wants 
wage concessions from them without giving stock. I expect management to try to 
sell the position that business will go on as usual -- 'We're going to buy more 
planes, expand our routes and improve service' -- but he will have great 
difficulties in marketing that to his own employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees are convinced that the airline must be made more efficient but 
that they should share in the fruits of any kind of restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
UAL employees are upset with Wolf for another reason: his sale of his own stock 
in the company last May for about $150 a share -- a statement, in effect, that 
he didn't think the unions were capable of financing their $201 offer. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the unfortunate side effects of this thing is that the relationship 
between the unions and Stephen Wolf has really soured," said Corey Rosen, 
executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership in San 
Francisco. "He sold his shares at $150 when he said the company was worth much 
more. They will view him as having been an obstacle rather than an aid in 
getting this transaction completed." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Spencer, a professor at the Northwestern University Transportation Center 
in Evanston, Ill., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees feel they have been put upon by Stephen Wolf," Spencer said. "He 
walked off with all the goodies. He wants the employees to make concessions 
while he walks off a millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst with Alliance Capital Management , a New 
York-based pension and mutual fund manager, predicted that UAL will let its 
employees strike rather than give in to their demands. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is unprecedented for an airline to have to negotiate new contract 
provisions with all its unions at one time. But that is the present case at 
United because the contracts, under terms of the Railway Labor Act, which 
governs airline labor pacts, are all now in the stage where they can be 
amended. The unions are expected soon to present tough new pay demands. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover effort was carried out by the pilots', mechanics' and flight 
attendants' unions at United. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a threat of anarchy at the company," Pettee said. "There will be a 
fight for control and -- in order to exercise control -- management would take 
a strike, if necessary." But not every expert interviewed believes that labor 
chaos is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Greenslet, a Florida-based airline analyst, said the unions still want 
to buy UAL, despite the setbacks they have suffered -- and may try again. A 
strike, he said, would kill any such possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"If the labor groups push their negotiating demands on management to a point 
that it results in a strike, the upshot of such a strike would be economic 
disaster," he said. "If labor ever wants to come back and restructure the deal, 
having put the company into a strike would kill any chances of doing that. It 
would be zero. The banks would not be able to support a deal with the earning 
power of the airline destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
And Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Professional Management at the 
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, doubts that there will be 
lasting animosity between labor and management at UAL. 
</P>
<P>
"The recent events," he maintained, "were useful for labor relations. These 
(members of the three unions) were working together towards a common goal, and 
that will be useful in the long run."

ADS: A BOYCOTT OF RJR NABISCO AND PHILIP MORRIS FOOD PRODUCTS IS SOUGHT. 
ANTI-SMOKING BACKERS WANT MARKETING OF CIGARETTES TO MINORS HALTED.

When you munch an Oreo cookie, you're also walking a mile for Camel cigarettes. 
And when you buy Jell-O, you're putting money into the Marlboro man's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the logic behind a nationwide boycott of Nabisco and Kraft 
products to be launched today by an anti-smoking lobby. The group is demanding 
that RJR Nabisco, the conglomerate that makes both Camels and Ritz Crackers, 
and Philip Morris, the tobacco giant that makes both Marlboros and Kool-Aid, 
stop marketing cigarettes to minors. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get parents outraged at attempts by the tobacco companies to get 
children to smoke," said Joe Tye, president of Stop Teen-Age Addiction to 
Tobacco, the Springfield, Mass.-based organization calling the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-edged slogan behind the effort: "Don't buy your family's food from 
companies that sell cancer." That message -- printed above large logos for 
Nabisco and Kraft -- will appear in ads the group hopes to place in some 
magazines and newspapers. 
</P>

The two firms that are the focus of the boycott are unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies that are conglomerates are a way of life in the U.S.," said Jason 
Wright, spokesman for RJR Nabisco, which also makes Salem and Winston brand 
cigarettes. "If consumers don't like our tobacco products, they shouldn't buy 
them. It's the same with our food products. These are separate and distinct 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Philip Morris, which also makes Virginia Slims and Merit 
cigarettes, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The latest action adds to boycott headaches at Philip Morris, whose Marlboro 
cigarettes and Miller beer already are being boycotted by the AIDS Coalition to 
Unleash Power (ACT UP), a San Francisco gay activist group that objects to the 
company's financial support of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C). An estimated 300 gay 
bars nationwide have stopped selling Miller beer. 
</P>
<P>
While the anti-smoking group does not expect to immediately hurt sales at 
Nabisco or Kraft, it is at least trying to inform the public that the big 
tobacco firms are also giant food makers. "We want people to know that when 
they buy Nabisco or Kraft products, they're supporting tobacco companies," said 
Tye. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the boycott asks that the cigarette makers stop trying to 
appeal to minors with ads that use cartoon characters -- such as the popular 
cartoon camel for Camel cigarettes. The boycott also asks that the tobacco 
companies stop promoting sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not the smoker," said Tye, who is chief operating officer at 
Baystate Medical Center, a Massachusetts hospital. "The problem is the tobacco 
industry. Until we stop them from being so effective at recruiting young 
people, we'll have this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking groups estimate that there are 3 million minors who are already 
regular smokers -- and another 3 million casual smokers under age 18. Tye says 
more than $1 billion of the cigarette industry's annual sales is to minors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for us to tell young people to just say no to nicotine," said Tye, 
"when the tobacco industry is spending $9 million a day telling them to say 
yes."

OIL COMPANIES WILL REV UP PRUDHOE EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE SIX COMPANIES WILL TRY TO ARREST A PRODUCTION DECLINE IN THE ALASKA 
FIELD. IT WILL COST $1.1 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Six major oil companies that own and operate the Prudhoe Bay oil field in 
Alaska said Tuesday that they will spend $1.1 billion to boost oil production 
and arrest a decline in output from the massive field that provides about 18% 
of the nation's total production. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co. and BP America Inc., a unit of British 
Petroleum, will be the lead partners in a project that will boost production of 
crude and other liquids from the field by 100,000 barrels a day when it comes 
on line in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which will increase the operators' ability to handle natural gas 
that will be reinjected into oil reservoirs, will result in the recovery of an 
additional 330 million to 450 million barrels of oil and liquids over the life 
of the field. It has reserves of about 4.6 billion barrels of oil left. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will significantly increase reserves," H. L. (Skip) Bilhartz, 
president of Arco Alaska Inc., said in an interview. "It is significant to the 
state of Alaska and to the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Although announcement of the project, which has been in planning stages for 
several years and follows a similar project that is near completion, coincided 
with the Middle East crisis, it was not spurred by events in the Persian Gulf 
or the subsequent rapid rise in crude prices, Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said the current crisis highlighted the nation's need for such a 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time of American concern about long-term oil supplies, this project will 
make a welcome contribution and shows Alaska's potential to add significant 
domestic reserves," BP Chairman Robert Horton and Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. 
Cook said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
The project comes at a time when oil output from Alaska's North Slope has been 
falling from its peak in 1988. Prudhoe Bay accounts for roughly 70% of the 
proven recoverable oil reserves on Alaska's North Slope. 
</P>
<P>
Production from all the fields on the North Slope has declined from 2.02 
million barrels a day in 1988 to about 1.77 million barrels a day in the first 
five months of this year, the Department of Energy reported. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening now is that they're battling geology, and to do that, you've 
got to spend a lot of money," said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy 
Research Associates in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
To boost production, operators of the fields must expand their ability to 
handle the natural gas that accompanies oil pumped from the ground. As an oil 
field ages, more gas comes up, making production harder. With the proper 
equipment, gas can be reinjected into the oil reservoir, creating pressure that 
forces more oil out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project is the second of two designed to do that. The first, a 
$470-million effort called Gas Handling Expansion 1, or GHX-1, should be 
completed by year-end. It will boost oil production at first by 75,000 barrels 
a day and eventually by 90,000, Bilhartz said. GHX-1 will add 400 million 
barrels of oil to Prudhoe Bay over the life of the reserves, he added. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer, barges hauled huge compressors from their manufacturing sites 
in Oregon up to Alaska's North Slope, where they will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The project announced Tuesday, called GHX-2, will require two separate barging 
operations, in the summers of 1993 and 1994. It will boost the field's 
gas-handling ability to 7.5 billion cubic feet when completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a major step forward, there's no doubt about that," said Scott T. 
Jones, president of AUS Consultants Inc. in Philadelphia and a former Arco 
executive. "I don't know if you could call it extending the life of the field, 
but you certainly will get more oil out of the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Middle East crisis began, Arco and the other oil companies that 
operate the North Slope fields have announced temporary measures to boost oil 
production. A program of "well refracturing," under which old oil wells are 
reworked, has the potential of adding another 50,000 barrels a day of liquid 
production, Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The new project promises to benefit the state of Alaska, which exacts hefty 
royalties and taxes on oil production. At oil prices of about $30 a barrel, the 
state could realize as much as $1 million a day from the 100,000 daily barrels 
of new production, said Edward Phillips, a petroleum economist with the state 
of Alaska. New jobs will also be created. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the project, Arco and BP announced that several other issues had 
been resolved among the various owners of oil and gas interests in the Prudhoe 
Bay field. Details were not disclosed, but Bilhartz said: "It was a major step 
forward for the unit and will settle many of the disputes between us, such that 
we can in an easier fashion bring forward future developments." 
</P>
<P>
The principal owners of the Prudhoe Bay oil field are Arco, with roughly 22%; 
BP, with roughly 51%, and Exxon Corp., with 22%, as well as Phillips Petroleum 
Co., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. BP and Arco operate the field.

NORTHROP FAULTED ON ALL ITS MILITARY PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: AN AIR FORCE OFFICIAL TELLS A HOUSE PANEL THAT THE FIRM IS 
INEXPERIENCED AS A PRIME CONTRACTOR. THE COMPANY SAYS IT'S IMPROVING.

<P>
An Air Force review of Northrop Corp. this summer found serious problems across 
the aerospace firm's corporate structure and in all of its military programs, 
including its $62.8-billion B-2 Stealth bomber project, an Air Force deputy 
chief of staff told a congressional panel Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The special review, which was ordered by Assistant Secretary of the Air Force 
John J. Welch Jr., found that Northrop has had little experience as a prime 
contractor and that it operates as a "loose federation of autonomous 
divisions." The Los Angeles firm has little or no executive development, and 
its leadership is loyal to the company "to a fault," the review found. 
</P>
<P>
The review's briefing materials were released Tuesday at the hearing, which was 
called by an investigating panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
The subcommittee has been investigating Northrop for four years and is one of 
three congressional panels since 1987 to hold hearings about Northrop's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by the panel, Brig. Gen. Robert W. Drewes, deputy chief of 
staff for contracting, could not identify a single Northrop program that is 
operating without significant difficulty. "In all the programs that we looked 
at, there were some problems," Drewes said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked in response, "Isn't that a disgrace, General?" 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is not something to be proud of," Drewes replied. 
</P>
<P>
When Welch ordered the special review, he wrote to Northrop Chairman Kent 
Kresa, "The nature of the performance problems is most serious." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said in an interview Tuesday that the "company 
recognized that it needed to make improvements in various areas and began doing 
that. That is still ongoing." The Air Force has noted, he added, that Northrop 
has "initiated" corrective action in recent months in many areas of concern. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa and other top managers, Cantafio said, are "committed to the strong 
follow-through that will make the changes endure and will carry out changes in 
other areas in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Welch said in an interview Tuesday: "I am not satisfied yet with 
the performance of Northrop." Welch said the Pentagon was asking for "pretty 
remarkable performance" by the company and that Northrop's problems are not 
unique. 
</P>
<P>
He said Northrop started "a little further back" than the rest of the aerospace 
industry and has had to cover more ground to develop as a major weapons 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Drewes, the only witness called Tuesday, said problems were found in the B-2 
bomber, Tacit Rainbow missile, the ALQ-135 radar-jamming system and 
unidentified black (secret) programs. He said the reviewers also found evidence 
of problems in the past with the MX missile but that the company seems to be 
doing a good job on it now. Nonetheless, Northrop lost the next contract in 
that program to Rockwell International earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Drewes said the Air Force remains concerned about trouble with the Stealth 
bomber's systems engineering, which integrates the bomber's various systems, 
enabling it to operate as an effective weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's problems stem in part from the fact that it operates "on the 
frontiers of technology," which often leads to difficulties when moving from 
research into production, Drewes said. But he added that the company's 
corporate culture lacks the discipline required by the Air Force, in part 
because the firm has depended heavily on foreign military sales in the past. 
</P>
<P>
When Northrop grew dramatically in the 1980s, going from 30,000 employees to 
50,000 and rising from $1.6 billion in sales to $6 billion, Drewes said, the 
internal controls and management programs were unable to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
"In this rapid buildup, there was not the rigor we would like to have seen," he 
said, adding later that "during the turbulence of that rapid growth, in some 
areas any discipline that they might have had was diluted." 
</P>
<P>
Drewes offered only the narrowest answers to the inquiries and declined to be 
specific in describing Northrop's problems. He repeatedly refused to categorize 
his reaction to his findings, despite questions about whether he was "shocked" 
or "surprised" by the results. 
</P>
<P>
Drewes said he was "impressed by the scope of the problems," but he added that 
he was "impressed by steps Northrop is taking to correct them." 
</P>
<P>
He said the review specifically did not go into areas that are under criminal 
investigation for fear of compromising those other inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is the subject of 12 criminal investigations by Pentagon agencies, 
according to sources on the House committee. Separately, it is under 
investigation by a dozen grand juries in seven locations around the country, 
according to an opening statement released by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), 
committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz reported from Washington and Vartabedian from Los Angeles.

Wall Street, in a renewed selloff Tuesday, sent scores of stocks to their 
lowest prices in more than a year as pessimism soared. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Dow Jones industrial average index closed down 78.22 at 2,445.54, 
a drop of 3.1%. It was the worst fall since a 93-point drop on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in New 
York Stock Exchange trading, with 1,313 down, 288 up and 388 unchanged. Big 
Board volume totaled 145.61 million shares, up from 99.47 million shares 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The market was lower for most of the day, and then fell sharply on a frantic 
bout of selling in the last hour as computer-trading programs kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
"Programs were going absolutely whacko," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the day's decline was a sharp rise in oil on Mideast turmoil, 
raising fears of inflation and widespread skepticism about federal budget 
talks. Those worries helped send interest rates soaring. (Main story, A1.) 
</P>
<P>
 Action in the Senate and House -- both of which passed a general budget 
resolution Monday and left their committees to work out the details -- did 
nothing to calm fears about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Worries that upcoming third-quarter profit reports will be dismal also added to 
the slide, particularly after a poor report from Motorola. That stock skidded 7 
to 52 3/4 after reporting earnings per share of 78 cents in the third quarter, 
versus the expected 90 cents to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Also suffering major hits on earnings disappointments were Dow Jones, down 2 
5/8 to 20 1/8; Whirlpool, off 2 to 18 5/8; and Consolidated Papers, off 7/8 to 
32 1/8. Whirlpool and Consolidated were just two of many stocks hitting new 
52-week lows. On the NYSE, 191 stocks hit new 52-week lows, versus 96 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Many recent market leaders fell sharply, raising worries about a new surge in 
bearishness. (Market Beat column, D3.) 
</P>
<P>
* Big losers among industrial stocks included Alcoa, down 2 1/8 to 59 3/4; 
Ford, off 1 3/4 to 31; Caterpillar, off 2 1/4 to 39 3/4, and Grace, down 1 3/4 
to 18 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Consumer stocks also were dashed, including Gap, down 1 3/8 to 44 1/8; light 
fixture maker Dynasty Classics, off 2 1/4 to 5 1/4, and General Mills, down 2 
3/4 to 80 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Sears closed down 1 1/4 at 25 1/4 after a Kidder, Peabody analyst reduced his 
third-quarter earnings estimate for the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
* After falling 11 1/2 Monday, UAL Corp. dropped 3 1/4 to 88. The company's 
board rejected a buyout offer by an employee-led group. 
</P>
<P>
* Travelers, which has been sliding since Friday, when it announced that it 
would cut its dividend by a third and increase its reserves against real estate 
losses, dropped another 1 3/8 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
* Countering the general trend, shares of drug maker Upjohn rose 1 to 37 3/4 on 
vague takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
* General Cinema gained 3/4 to 18 1/8 on news that it sold its 17% stake in 
Cadbury. Neiman Marcus gained 3/4 to 11 7/8 on speculation that General Cinema 
might now bid for the 40% of Neiman it doesn't own. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks fell as investors took profits after two sessions of gains. 
The key Nikkei 225-share index closed down 134.89 at 23,495.11. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices fell sharply on concerns that had dogged the London 
market before sterling's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. The 
Financial Times 100-share index closed down 67.5 at 2,134.1. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell sharply in West Germany, with the the 30-share DAX index 
dropping 32.12, or 2.2%, to 1,433.41. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Traders Buried in Worry; Prices Fall 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also plunged on the soaring price of oil and increasing investor 
pessimism about interest rates and the ability of Congress to pass a meaningful 
budget agreement. There was also concern about an oversupply of government 
bonds, with two auctions planned this week and the Treasury's quarterly 
refunding sale next month. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped 1-25/32, or about $17.81 per 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield soared to 8.96% from 8.81% late Monday.

loans, was quoted at 8.063%, up from 7.938% late Friday. The fed funds rate 
from Monday wasn't available because of the Columbus Day holiday.

CURRENCY: Foreign Money Sales Ease Dollar's Drop 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mostly lower on world markets, but selloffs in other 
currencies prevented its decline from deepening. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell sharply in Asian dealings, hitting new lows against the German 
mark and 18-month lows against the Japanese yen before consolidating and 
recovering slightly when trading shifted to Europe and the United States, said 
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the consulting firm IDEA. 
</P>
<P>
Traders cashed in on the weekend run-up in the British pound and the yen, and 
their profit taking prevented the dollar from relinquishing further ground. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 129.95 yen. Later in London, it 
was quoted higher at 130.30 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 130.25 yen, 
down from 130.48 yen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound, which soared Monday after its official entry into the 
European exchange rate mechanism, closed at $1.973, down slightly from Monday's 
$1.976. 
</P>
<P>
Against the German mark, the dollar closed at 1.523, down from Monday's 1.531. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Rumors of Soviet Sale Undercuts Gold 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange amid fears of a 
massive Soviet gold selloff, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans were mixed, and meat and 
livestock futures were slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $4.80 to $5.30 lower, with the contract for delivery in October at 
$389.70 an ounce. Silver settled 7.7 to 8.5 cents lower, with October at $4.59 
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of precious metals futures, which usually follow the energy futures 
market, plummeted after traders began selling off on rumors that the 
cash-strapped Soviet Union is expected to sell off a good quantity of its gold 
supply to finance recent purchases of grains and other goods.

VISA TIGHTENS RULES ON CREDIT CARD ISSUANCE

Following the wild success of AT&amp;T's Universal credit card, Visa U.S.A. 
said Tuesday that it changed regulations for non-bank members seeking access to 
its profitable credit card system. 
</P>
<P>
A Visa official denied that the changes, effective immediately and possibly 
retroactive, were in response to the Universal card's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Bank members have objected strenuously to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
Co.'s presence in the profitable Visa and Mastercard credit card systems, 
charging that the powerful telephone giant was stealing business from bank 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, banks welcomed non-bank members to issue Visas and Mastercards, 
believing that it put more of the credit cards into people's wallets and it 
helped gain even more acceptance among merchants. 
</P>
<P>
But banks have said AT&amp;T is not like the typical non-bank credit card 
issuer, such as charitable and educational institutions, that issue "affinity" 
cards. Affinity cards let non-member organizations partner with member banks 
and participate in a credit-card program. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Visa sought to restrict how non-banks can issue Visa cards. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, affinity cards cannot be used to access any account other 
than one maintained by a Visa card-issuing financial institution; affinity 
programs must honor all Visa cards, not just its own; and non-members are 
prohibited from financing more than 25% of their receivables from the credit 
card programs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at a local Mastercard office in Los Angeles could not be reached for 
comment as to whether they would be making similar rule changes. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said Visa's rule changes would not affect its Universal card 
operations. "Our reaction is that the rule changes by Visa have absolutely no 
impact on AT&amp;T's Universal card program," Bruce Reid, an AT&amp;T spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, AT&amp;T, which issues its Universal card through Universal 
Bank of Columbus, Ga., said it had opened 3.1 million accounts.

EX-EXECUTIVE IS SENTENCED IN JAPAN'S RECRUIT SCANDAL

A top Japanese businessman received a suspended jail sentence and heavy fine 
Tuesday for his role in the 1988 Recruit corruption scandal, which brought down 
the government and sparked fierce debate about political fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
But political analysts said the verdict will have little impact in reforming 
the nation's money-oriented political system. 
</P>
<P>
Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph 
&amp; Telephone Corp., was handed a two-year jail term suspended for three 
years and fined $170,000 by presiding judge Takeshi Toyota for his part in the 
Recruit shares-for-favors scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Shinto, 80, was found guilty of illegally receiving 10,000 unlisted shares of a 
subsidiary of communications conglomerate Recruit Co. He made a handsome 
personal profit when the shares were listed. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Shinto made Nippon Telegraph services available to Recruit. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 scandal, in which Recruit was found to have distributed more than $11 
million to politicians, business leaders and ministry officials -- in the form 
of unlisted shares, cash contributions and purchases of tickets for 
fund-raising parties -- led to the resignation of Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita and several of his cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Takeshita nor another former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, were 
charged, although Nakasone admitted that his aides received 29,000 shares, and 
Takeshita too said his secretaries had received large amount of stocks and 
other favors. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven other people, including two politicians, are still on trial in the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdict (against Shinto) indicates that tough penalties are likely to be 
brought against other defendants," said political commentator Makoto Sakata. 
</P>
<P>
But Sakata, who specializes in ties between Japan's companies and politicians, 
said the overall political scene and politicians will never change. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit affair overshadowed the 1976 Lockheed scandal, in which politicians 
were suspected of taking bribes in return for awarding lucrative contracts to 
the U.S. aircraft maker.

FASHION: THE CURRENT PASSION FOR '60S STYLE HAS BROUGHT EMILIO PUCCI BACK TO

There is a man who has probably saved the lives of millions of people. The man 
who discovered penicillin. You ask 100 people today if they know his name, they 
won't know. But if you ask who Bill Blass is or Dior, they know. Now let's get 
things in the right light. Can you compare what (bacteriologist Sir Alexander) 
Fleming has done . . . with anything that has been done in fashion? -- Emilio 
Pucci, fashion designer 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Pucci, the Florentine Renaissance man whose mark on styles of the 1960s 
was as euphoric and revolutionary as the Beatles' impact on music, is suddenly 
back in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
As other top Italian designers preview their spring 1991 collections in Milan 
this week, Pucci, perhaps the hottest name of all at this moment, has no plan 
to be included. Members of the press and store buyers curious about his latest 
creations will have to trek to his Florence showroom to see them. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, the Italian master offered color-crazed, eye-popping, 
geometric-printed clothing he developed from the ground up. He used clingy, 
virtually weightless silk jersey that became wearable Pop Art when matched with 
his designs, attracting such divergent customers as Gloria Steinem and Marilyn 
Monroe, who was buried in one of his outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Now swept up in the tidal wave of '60s love-in looks, Pucci's combination of 
electric colors and clean, racy shapes are re-attracting hordes of young 
customers -- and their mothers. Department stores carrying the Pucci label 
can't keep the clothes in stock. Nor can Pucci's own boutiques worldwide, 
including the one right around the corner from his family palace here, on Via 
de Pucci in downtown Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, vintage Puccis, saved by his customers of the '50s, '60s 
and '70s, have become sought-after collectibles, especially those famed, silk 
jersey, Op Art tights from the psychedelic period when Pucci became known as 
"the prince of prints." 
</P>
<P>
And then there are all those knockoffs. The adventuresome, 75-year-old 
aristocrat -- who also has been a member of Italy's Olympic ski team, served as 
a torpedo bomber in World War II and spent more than a decade in the Italian 
parliament -- doesn't say much about the fact that his styles are now being 
copied as furiously as Chanel handbags and Bart Simpson T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
But what he does bring up, indignantly, is that top designers from Milan to 
Paris are now knocking him off and charging far more for Pucci-like prints than 
he charges for the originals. (His Lycra-laced body suits cost $220. Christian 
Lacroix showed one, inspired by Pucci, for $465.) 
</P>
<P>
A member of one of Florence's oldest families (his official title is the 
Marchese di Barsento), Pucci believes it is the duty of "whoever is privileged 
by birth, by money, by nationality and by health to help those who are not 
privileged -- in anything you do, even a stupid little work like fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is best known for his accomplishments in fashion and at one time 
had his light-hearted designs on everything from Lincoln Continentals to Parker 
pens, he does not appear to be the carefree, playful spirit one might expect. 
The man who created the ultimate '60s outfit -- the curve-hugging, 
hallucinogenic mini dress -- is no lightweight. And today, at least, he would 
rather talk philosophy, history, art, ethics, the future. 
</P>
<P>
When he talks fashion, it's sideways, as when he repeatedly emphasizes his 
quest to keep quality high and prices within the budgets of many people, not 
just the privileged few. Indeed, for designer goods that are well constructed 
and clearly unique, his clothes are considered true bargains. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a pair of Pucci's printed leggings sell for $75 at Pucci boutiques 
-- when they have them in stock. Cotton panties, printed with the trademark, 
geometric Pucci prints, can be picked up for $12 or $15 a pair in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Fashion is an activity which has grown from something very sensible into 
something which I won't define," Pucci declared, insinuating that he finds many 
of the trends in the industry loathsome. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting behind his desk in his office at the sumptuous, 1,000-year-old Palazzo 
Pucci, where he lives and works, his feet were propped on a footstool. He 
apologized for it (and the cane he was temporarily using), explaining that he 
is still recovering from a recent, 47-day hospital stay for a mysterious 
nervous condition that surfaced after two sporting accidents (he was thrown 
from a horse, then injured himself diving). 
</P>
<P>
Pucci was dressed classically in a navy jacket, gray slacks and white shirt, 
enlivened with one of his own printed silk neckties. And even though he had 
spent 18 hours the day before on a work jaunt to Germany, he was energetic and 
eager to explore an eclectic range of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* World politics, particularly his trip the day before, in which he had 
participated in an emotional, reunification-of-Germany fashion celebration: "It 
was unbelievable. I went as a duty and turned out to perform something which 
made (citizens of East Germany and West Germany) feel that they were together." 
</P>
<P>
* An encounter last year with England's Queen Mother Elizabeth, who showed him 
how to ward off mosquitoes by using homeopathic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
* A project for an airplane able to fly 25,000 m.p.h., "which means Tokyo to 
New York: 19 minutes." But to Pucci, this possibility is far more than just the 
latest time cruncher for the ultra jet set. Rather, he sees it as another 
example of how the speed of modern society will ultimately make war obsolete: 
"Tokyo to New York may be the same distance (in time) as Long Island is from 
the center of New York. Can you conceive of conditions that are diametrically 
opposed when the world is becoming as big as the city of New York?" 
</P>
<P>
Coaxed back to the subject for which he is best known and is currently being 
heralded, Pucci initially concentrated on what he sees as the fashion 
industry's most negative developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Something strange is happening today," he insisted, in tones as dramatic as 
the blue notes in his necktie. "I won't mention the (designer's) name, but I've 
seen this on television. A model walks out in an impeccable black suit. She 
turns around and how is the suit in the back? Two ribbons. She's completely 
naked. Now that suit cost $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Another French designer -- you could see the panties under the skirts. This is 
ridiculous," he continued, attributing such concoctions to the intentional 
exploitation of insecure customers who "have to be boosted up by buying things 
which are horrible, badly made and look ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
A Roman Catholic who received a master's degree in social science from Reed 
College in Portland, Ore., and a Ph.D. in political science from the University 
of Florence, Pucci also is offended by the public performances of the American 
who is now perhaps his most famous client: Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the greatest gift the Lord made to man is a woman," he said at the 
mention of of Madonna's name. "And I was shocked to find a picture of Madonna 
(in a sexually explicit pose). I think this is a most incredible thing." (On 
stage and in photographs, Madonna has been frequently seen in provocative 
poses, among them a cover of Interview magazine earlier this year in which she 
was grabbing her crotch.) 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, she arrived in London, looked all over London (for Puccis) and 
bought everything she found. (Photographers) went around and pictured her, and 
they sent me a cable about it, and I answered, 'I'm glad she's finally dressed 
elegantly and discreetly,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The "new" Pucci look uses the same, nearly weightless, form-fitting silk 
jerseys the designer developed in the 1950s, but there have been some changes. 
He now collaborates with his daughter, Laudomia Pucci, 29, who serves as vice 
president of his design firm. 
</P>
<P>
"He does the prints and the fabrics," said the younger Pucci. "The newer prints 
are much stronger and much less detailed than those of the '60s. They're not as 
wild and crazy, but they're definitely more modern than they were in the '60s. 
They're pure, and there's more intensity. I work with him on the styles. We do 
the accessories together. It's very much a family business." 
</P>
<P>
She and her father now turn out three collections a year (resort, 
spring-summer, fall-winter). They have no plans to show with other European 
designers at shows in either Paris or Milan because, as she put it, "it's too 
expensive" and goes against her father's philosophy of selling his wares at 
reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Puccis have chosen to work with clients in showrooms in New York 
and Florence, distributing on "a very exclusive basis around the world" through 
just a few department stores. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, for example, Pucci styles are sold at Neiman Marcus. But don't 
look for a Pucci boutique to open in Los Angeles or Beverly Hills. (The only 
Pucci boutique in the United States is in New York City; there are only three 
others in the world, all in Italy.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to open a store ever again," the designer claimed. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the last few years, he has closed four or five stores 
around the world because rents have skyrocketed to about $300,000 or $400,000 a 
year. He also estimated that costs for insurance, taxes, utility and personnel 
add another $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to spend half a million dollars for a store, how much do I have to 
charge for a a skirt made in the worst fabric: $200? $500? If something costs 
$5 to make, why should it cost $25 to sell it?" 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would like to do instead of expanding his boutiques, Pucci 
indicated he would prefer to continue doing what he hopes to be remembered for: 
"bringing joy to people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
"I have several dresses that weigh under 100 grams, which is under 3 ounces. 
You can take the dress, put it in your pocket, come out of the office, go to 
the bathroom, wash, make up and put it on and you're ready for dinner," he 
said, noting no basic differences between his work of 30 years ago and that of 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put on something with color, suddenly you feel happy and rested. You 
go out with a man, and he gets joy from how you look. I'm not giving you a 
dress. I'm giving an element of joy to you, which is much more important than a 
stupid dress."

IT'S NOT ALL PEACHES AND CREAM;

Dear Peaches, 
</P>
<P>
Can it really be? You were actually cheering in the streets the day you won the 
right to host the 1996 Summer Olympics. God, when we were awarded the '84 Games 
in 1978, the silence was deafening. And those who spoke up were not amused: 
</P>
<P>
 The whole issue couldn't have come at a worse time, what with Proposition 13 
and people petrified of costs and all. -- Former Councilwoman Rosalind Wyman 
</P>
<P>
 I don't really care if we get the Olympics or not. I just can't get all 
enthused over these preliminaries. -- Watts Towers security guard Jim A. Reid 
</P>
<P>
 As far as any spontaneous expression of feeling goes, I wouldn't expect any 
great emotional outpouring. We're talking about an event that is six years in 
the future. -- Mayor Tom Bradley 
</P>
<P>
Enthused, enshmused. We may not have been excited in 1978, but by the time 1984 
rolled around we were . . . still not that worked up. 
</P>
<P>
A mere 2 1/2 months before the Games began, a nationwide poll by the New York 
public relations firm Manning, Selvage &amp; Lee revealed that 62% of the 
respondents could not name a single U.S. athlete who was going to compete in 
Los Angeles. Only 51% even remembered that the 1980 Olympics were held in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Around here, all anyone talked about was how far from the city they would be 
during the Games, and possibly, if they really wanted to get involved, how much 
money they would rake in by renting their empty homes to Olympic visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, by the time David Wolper's spine-tingling opening ceremonies 
concluded with the lighting of the Olympic torch by Rafer Johnson on July 28, 
1984, this was a town of converts. With the exception, perhaps, of the 
alternative Nihilist Olympics Organizing Committee, nary a soul owned up to 
uttering a discouraging word about the Games. 
</P>
<P>
It was, now that we think of it, the best of times in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
We had no traffic, the city was nearly crime-free, everyone loved everyone 
else. Heck, we almost ended world hunger and saved the planet from nuclear 
disaster right then and there. Felt that way, anyhow. Yep. Those were the days. 
</P>
<P>
And because the Olympics were so good to us, Atlanta, we'd like to help you 
with your Games. Not in a meddling way, mind you, but in the generous, magical 
way that is the Olympic spirit. Not the Olympic spirit of boycotts, terrorism, 
billion-dollar deficits and political infighting. We didn't have any of that 
here. (OK, so there was a little Soviet boycottski and maybe a smidgen of 
behind-the-scenes warfare. No one's perfect.) 
</P>
<P>
You should think of the Olympics, Atlanta, as a play in three acts: an 
interminable first, a brief and glorious second, and an emotionally deflated, 
postpartum third. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Act I: The Long Hello 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a horrendous undertaking. But it's an adventure, so what? -- 
Angelene Kasza, principal of Norwood Elementary School, Los Angeles, Feb. 2, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a lot of Angelenos, Kasza had the Olympic spirit relatively early on 
and possesses it to this day. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember everything about the Olympics because first of all, I am an avid 
sports fan, and second, the concept was so wildly exciting," Kasza said. "I 
couldn't believe that anyone would look at the work it would entail -- everyone 
was so hysterical about it. Where was the confidence and trust that people 
would rise to the occasion?" 
</P>
<P>
Kasza's advice to Atlanta: "Those school kids have got to be involved in the 
buildup and the excitement. We had Olympic math, Olympic reading. Each day we 
walked our children down to the Coliseum. They saw the athletes and the 
excitement and really got caught up in the spirit of the thing. It's once in a 
lifetime for these youngsters, and they'll never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Relax Los Angeles; the Soviet Union is not going to pull out of the Olympic 
Games. -- Yale Richmond, retired Foreign Service officer, on The Times Op-Ed 
page, November, 1983 
</P>
<P>
Which reminds us, Atlanta. Anything can happen. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as LAOOC President Peter Ueberroth puts it: "Expect the unexpected. In 
Munich, the big worry was that they would never be able to get people in and 
out of town -- that transportation and gridlock would be trouble. And, of 
course, they had quite a different problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody here, or in the East, thought we could pull it off. Our self-esteem has 
taken a perceptible jump. -- Selwyn Enser, USC professor, September, 1984 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar?

"When we started this process against 14 cities in the United States, we 
weren't given a chance at all, and when we were designated the U.S. candidate 
city, we weren't given much of a chance at all," said Robert Brennan of the 
Atlanta Organizing Committee. "Now that we've got the Games, people are not 
giving us much of a chance to stage them very well. It's a strikingly familiar 
pattern." 
</P>
<P>
Putting on the Games, said Ueberroth, "is a task that's very visible, on which 
your missteps are highlighted." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Usher, general manager of the LAOOC, advises that you ignore the prophets 
of doom and, like the commercial says, never let them see you sweat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can doubt yourself," said Usher, "but don't let other people lose 
confidence in your ultimate actions." 
</P>
<P>
How many days of doubt did Usher have? "Let's see, how long was I with the 
committee -- 1,500, 1,600 days?" 
</P>
<P>
John Bevilaqua, a vice president for the LAOOC, lives in Atlanta, where he runs 
a sports marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta has had a complex all these years, you know," said Bevilaqua. "It was 
burned to the ground in 1865 by Sherman. Its symbol is the phoenix rising from 
the ashes. We had civil rights problems in the '60s. Then a couple of years 
ago, Sports Illustrated called Atlanta 'Loserville USA' " because of the dismal 
records of its professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
We looked it up and, as it happens, Sports Illustrated was merely quoting local 
columnist Lewis Grizzard, who dubbed Atlanta "Losersville." Not very nice words 
from a native son. But coming from a newspaperman, not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"The L.A. Times would run almost daily some expert, quote unquote, who would 
forecast the failure of the Games," said Ueberroth. "You live with these people 
for five years." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Atlanta, 1996 is your big chance to shine in sports. Not that we want you 
to feel over-pressured. But as Rich Perelman, LAOOC vice president for press 
operations, put it: "It's not just Atlanta on trial here, it's the whole 
country. Everyone is counting on them to do a good job. They're going to be on 
TV in front of the world for a long time. Look at Miami during the Super Bowl. 
Multiply that by 2 billion viewers. It makes a real big impact." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of impact, Deborah Sussman ought to know. Her firm, Sussman/Prejza, 
designed the look of our Games -- the explosively bright confetti of magenta 
and vermilion triangles that became synonymous with the joyousness of the 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
Her advice to designers: Start early, stick to your guns, eschew politics and 
don't let your nightmares get to you. 
</P>
<P>
"I never gave up. I never compromised," she said. "I am sure people thought I 
was nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Possessed, maybe. We don't know about nuts. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of difficulties," said Sussman. "Some of us got weird flus. I 
remember I was nauseous for about a month and a half. My doctor insisted it was 
stress. I had nightmares constantly that it wouldn't get done in time or get 
done well or that the people who were working against us would prevail. Mainly, 
the problem was shortness of time and largeness of project. I had dreams that 
there were mountains of sand and I had to hold them up." 
</P>
<P>
OK, nuts. 
</P>
<P>
But nuts was great in 1984. Nuts were ash-covered Japanese performers dangling 
from the roof of the Music Center. Nuts was Shakespeare performed in French by 
actors in whiteface. Nuts was the 10-week Olympic Arts Festival, and nowhere 
was the boldness of the 1984 Summer Games expressed more explicitly. 
</P>
<P>
We understand you're planning your own four-year festival, tentatively dubbed 
the Dance of Life, scheduled to begin when the 1992 Barcelona Games end. One 
piece of advice from a man who knows: "Forget four years. Do four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
That man is Robert Fitzpatrick, director of our 10-week Olympic Arts Festival. 
His advice came via car phone, from Paris, where he is now president of Euro 
Disney, the amusement park scheduled to open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Barcelona had been trying to do a four-year festival and it is a meaningless 
exercise," said Fitzpatrick. "A festival by its very nature means a focused 
period of time in which you get people to step out of their ordinary lives and 
try something different. The whole point of the festival is not to do one more 
performance of Beethoven's Fifth, but to show works you wouldn't normally get 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
What an arts festival director needs, said Fitzpatrick, is vision, independence 
and an ample budget -- in his case, more than $10 million. His counsel: be 
controversial, stay out of politics, don't bow to outside pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"We were under great pressure to include a specific dance company with close 
ties to the Reagan family and their supporters. We originally had conversations 
(with the company) but they did not want to meet our requirements. What they 
proposed had no impact." 
</P>
<P>
You've got six years to make it work, Atlanta. So go about your business and 
remember what Usher said: "Try not to maintain the high. Let the enthusiasm go 
into remission. You can't maintain anything for six years and if you try to, 
you'll just wear people out." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House wasn't even speaking to me. -- Peter Ueberroth in "Making it 
Happen: Peter Ueberroth and the 1984 Olympics," by Times Staff Writer Kenneth 
Reich 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let the big shots push you around, Atlanta. Believe us, they will try. 
</P>
<P>
"Every ambassador from Washington, everyone in the State Department, every 
consulate and every consul general will tell them how to run their business," 
said LAOOC protocol official Joel Rubenstein. "Everybody has their agendas. 
They tell you you're going to create an international incident if you don't 
give (a country's official) front row seats at the events. There's 160 
countries out there that have very important people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Act II: Build It. They Will Come. 
</P>
<P>
Boycotts notwithstanding, that is. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the first teams arrive in your Olympic villages, you will have 
constructed an estimated $420 million worth of new facilities. We didn't have 
much building to do at all. All we had to construct were a velodrome at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills and a swimming complex at USC. (That was one reason we 
did so well financially.) But you! You'll even have razed an island in the 
middle of a lake at Stone Mountain Park to make way for rowing events. That 
would never have happened here. Trust us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like Catalina Island," said Bevilaqua. "It's not usable. There's a 
big attitude toward environmental impact out there (in California). It's not 
like that in Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Opening Ceremonies commence, everything will be in place -- or 
at least appear to be. By then, not even the most solitary Atlantan will be 
unaffected by the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 I was lying there thinking I was probably the only person in the whole world 
watching the Opening Ceremony of the Olympics in a flotation tank. -- Larry 
Hughes, co-owner of Altered States MindGym, August, 1984 
</P>
<P>
Hughes estimates he spent a total of 20 hours watching the Games afloat on 10 
inches of Epsom-salted water. 
</P>
<P>
"The TV screen was about two feet above my field of vision and I was unaware of 
anything else besides what was on the screen. I liked watching the swim meets 
because the camera angles are so fantastic that you see just the upper bodies 
of the swimmers as they move along, and as I was floating there, it seemed like 
I was in the next lane with them. "My recommendation for Atlanta is for people 
to buy video-equipped flotation tanks and to set them up and watch the 
Olympics. I'd like to issue a challenge to some Atlantan out there to break my 
record of 20 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Float like a wet butterfly, Atlanta, for only $4,000 per tank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 We thought it would be Saturday night every night, but actually it's Wednesday 
night every night. -- Patrick Terrail, owner of Ma Maison 
</P>
<P>
So maybe business was off in a few places. OK, in a lot of places. Mostly, our 
locals figured the restaurants would be so jammed, they ate at home for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We were expecting bonanza business. We were almost shocked the first week when 
the business did not come through," Terrail said. "We woke up one morning by 
about the third day and found there was no traffic." Wistfully, he adds, "We 
wish it would be like that today." 
</P>
<P>
Terrail suggests that Atlanta restaurateurs do what he and a number of local 
restaurateurs did: promise not to raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
That is almost precisely the advice that Usher gave to Barcelona's committee 
recently: "I told them the most important thing that the citizens and 
businesses should avoid is getting greedy and looking at this as a cow to be 
milked." 
</P>
<P>
Or an orange to be juiced. Or a peach to be cobblered. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to realize that Los Angeles is made up mostly of nonmainstream 
people. -- Elisha Shapiro, organizer of the Nihilist Olympics, July, 1984 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to believe it, even in the South where we know y'all are crazy for 
sports, but not everyone likes the discus throw. (Actually, polls show that 
women's gymnastics is by far and away the most popular Olympic sport. There is 
no close second.) 
</P>
<P>
For the non-sports inclined, Elisha Shapiro created the Decathlon of Housework, 
the Freeway Relay and the Rosie Ruiz Marathon (start on foot, end on foot, use 
any mode of transportation you want in between). 
</P>
<P>
"It was an antidote to feeling left out," said Shapiro, who teaches English at 
Santa Monica College. "Watching people throw discuses about wasn't really that 
exciting to me. I wanted to get in on the fun." 
</P>
<P>
And you can too, non-mainstream Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta is a wonderful, vibrant, sophisticated city," said Shapiro. "A city 
like that probably has a lot of people who are not mainstream, and to those 
people, I address my suggestions because the mainstream people will already 
know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
The South being famous for fried foods and lardy gravies, he suggests a 
cholesterol-raising competition, in which the first person to raise his or her 
cholesterol 100 points wins. Or, for the sportier types, a target-shooting 
contest, in which mailboxes could be shot from moving cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to Atlanta, make your own fun," said Shapiro. "Don't wait for 
whoever is organizing the Olympics to make your fun for you." 
</P>
<P>
Some of our biggest attractions are our supermarkets. -- LAOOC protocol 
official Joel Rubenstein, April, 1984 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people coming in from Third World and Eastern Bloc countries 
who had not experienced anything like (our supermarkets). These are the simple 
things that you and I take for granted," said Rubenstein. "You buy a jar of 
instant coffee, you don't think anything of it. Someone from a Third World 
country, a 16-ounce jar of Maxwell House is a treasure." 
</P>
<P>
So stock up, Atlanta. It's the little beans that mean a lot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Act III: The Crash 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, zoom, it was over. We kind of hit bottom. -- Norman 
Miller, director of UCLA's Olympics Games office, September, 1984 
</P>
<P>
How can we tell you what all the days after are like? Well, we were aching from 
the loss. Our foreheads were still hot from Olympic pin-trading fever. We'd 
hosted 650,000 visitors, 7,800 athletes and 9,000 journalists. The Games 
straddled 29 cities, nine counties and three states. Thanks to the thrifty ways 
of Ueberroth and his LAOOC, the Games realized a profit of $222.7 million, 
divvied up among the U.S. Olympic Committee, U.S. sports federations and 
Southern California youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we did kind of hit bottom. But when we did, we bounced, buoyed by memories 
of the impish Mary Lou Retton in graceful action, Rocket Man swooping into the 
Coliseum, wiry marathoners running past our homes as we watched (for free!). We 
liberated the brightly colored Olympic banners from the light poles, wrote 
glowing letters to local newspapers and watched in dismay as the traffic 
returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us were changed forever. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost most of my hair," said the LAOOC's Rich Perelman. "I went from balding 
to pretty bald. I think I was going to lose the hair anyway, but the stress of 
the Olympics probably accelerated it." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fitzpatrick of the Arts Festival was similarly altered: "My hair was 
bright red when I started and it was white when I finished. At least, that's 
how I remember it." 
</P>
<P>
So brace yourself for exhilarating sadness and relief and instant nostalgia, 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're doing it, you're crazed, but then it's over and it's wonderful," 
said David Wolper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are an awful lot of hard-working, intelligent people in Atlanta 
that don't really have a clue what they're in for," said Bevilaqua. "It's a 
real roller-coaster ride. They don't have a feel for the (enormousness) of the 
task yet." 
</P>
<P>
But you will. And soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
Our best, 
</P>
<P>

BARBECUE CURBS: NO NEED TO FUME YET; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS: A BAN ON CHARCOAL LIGHTER FLUID OR PRE-SOAKED BRIQUETTES WON'T TAKE 
EFFECT UNTIL 1992. IN THE MEANTIME, MANY ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE WHEN FIRING 
UP THE GRILL. 
</P>

<P>
Take heart, beach and back-yard barbecuers. There's hope for starting the 
barby, even without charcoal lighter fluid or pre-soaked briquettes, both of 
which will be banned in the Los Angeles Basin beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
And you may find you like the taste of the food better, too. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative products -- wax-treated chips and cubes of wood or sawdust, wood 
with natural resins, chimney or electric starters, nontoxic starting gel -- are 
available on the market now. So are different kinds of wood -- mesquite, 
hickory, alder, maple, orange, pear, cherry and apple -- to add different 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flap for the $500-million-a-year charcoal briquette industry came 
last week when the South Coast Air Quality Management District voted to 
prohibit the sale of charcoal lighter and fluid-saturated briquettes in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, on Jan. 1, 1992, in an 
effort to reduce smog levels. 
</P>
<P>
Although AQMD officials admitted that the elimination of lighter fluid to start 
fires will cut less than two-tenths of 1% of the pollution in the basin, this 
is the first time they have taken on consumer products in the war on air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say that residents of the four-county area use about 2,700 
gallons of lighter fluid a day to ignite barbecue fires, emitting an average of 
two tons of pollutants into the air (lighter fluid is made from 100% petroleum 
compounds, the main smog component). 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the industry-estimated 2 million barbecuers affected by the 
impending ban seemed to take the news in stride, probably because it doesn't 
begin for 1 1/2 years. In a spot check of groceries, barbecue shops and home 
center stores, none reported a rush on charcoal lighter fluid. A few did 
receive inquiries about alternative starting methods for barbecue cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecue industry representatives, though, were not so complacent. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were an inventor, I'd be looking at Los Angeles," said Sandra Burton, 
executive director of the Barbecue Industry Assn. in Naperville, Ill., which 
represents manufacturers and suppliers of barbecue products. "We never knew 
(lighter fluid emission) was a problem. We know that pollution is bad (in 
Southern California) -- we're not arguing that point. We just would have liked 
to have had a little more time to reformulate the products so they will meet 
the standards." 
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives are gearing up to find new formulas for non-polluting 
liquid starters. "There's already a prototype product, a reformulation, that 
reduced emissions by 50%," Burton said. "If there's a way to make them useable, 
then we're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Burton said two-thirds of Americans who barbecue prefer to use charcoal lighter 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland-based Kingsford Products Co., which sells the majority of charcoal used 
in the U.S., found through sales data studies that 65% of Los Angeles 
barbecuers use lighter fluid to start their fires. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsford, a division of Clorox Co., manufactures regular charcoal, pre-soaked 
briquettes, pre-treated individual bags and charcoal lighter fluid starter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful we'll be able to come up with something that meets the (AQMD) 
standards," said Kingsford spokeswoman Sandy Sullivan. "We're primarily looking 
at liquids. The paraffin and wax products have been around a long time . . . . 
We're working with the AQMD technical team on developing a methodology for 
testing (liquid starter), so it can become environmentally acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
However, Burton and Sullivan warn consumers not to use gasoline to ignite fires 
because it is dangerously flammable. 
</P>
<P>
An independent market research study, commissioned by Kingsford in May, showed 
that 4 1/2% of those surveyed would opt for gasoline if charcoal starter were 
banned. "We didn't expect it to be that high," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new AQMD regulations, consumers will not be fined for using charcoal 
lighter fluid or pre-treated briquettes in 1992, but stores will be prohibited 
from selling it -- if the liquid emits more than 0.02 pounds of pollutants each 
time it is used. Retailers who do sell the prohibited barbecue products can be 
assessed fines of up to $25,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Propane and natural gas-fueled grills already comply with the new AQMD 
standards, as do electric starters and metal chimneys that use paper for 
starting charcoal fires. So do many wax-coated fire chips and nontoxic starter 
gels. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers seem to be favoring the more natural products, wood and 
paraffin-coated charcoal, rather than chemicals, according to Mike Varley, 
vice-president of the Australian-headquartered Galore Group, which operates 13 
Barbeques Galore stores in California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a very big swing in the last few years toward alternative 
products and gas barbecues," Varley said. "The propane gas or the natural gas 
(grills) cost more money to begin with, but far less in the long run." Gas 
grills, he explained, can run from about $79 to $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Among the alternative products are Happy Jack, a single-use bag of mesquite and 
oak wood charcoal coated with wax; Fire Flakes, wax-coated wood chips; Fat Wood 
and Fire Light Sticks with natural resins; Seymour Fire Blox, nontoxic 
fiberboard impregnated with wax. 
</P>
<P>
Gelron Corp. (formerly Jiffy Products) in Lisle, Ill., manufactures Enviro-Fuel 
Gel Fuel and Hawaiian Fire Ring, an odorless, alcohol-based gel that is put in 
a metal ring and placed under the bottom grate of a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to limiting pollutants from back-yard barbecuing, the AQMD also is 
looking into ways to measure -- and restrict -- restaurant emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD would like to reduce restaurant emissions by 90%, but it does not have 
a protocol for measuring pollutants emitted by restaurants, whether restaurants 
emit one or 50 pounds of pollutants a day, according to Robert W. Small Ph.D., 
director of the Center for Hospitality Management at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District's charcoal lighter sales ban is 
the first district effort to target a consumer product to try to clean up the 
Los Angeles Basin's air. The AQMD board, formed in February, 1977, 
traditionally has regulated such operations as factories and oil refineries to 
reduce air pollution. But as part of a sweeping plan approved March 17, 1989, 
it now is aiming at industrial, commercial, agriculture, government and 
consumer products.

<P>
Tenacious is one word for Wendy Goldberg. Dedicated, vivacious, dynamic and 
considerate will do, too. She's a catalyst. She's a doer able to juggle the 
world and still speak sotto voce. 
</P>
<P>
Professionally, she is a principal consultant to the Max Factor Advisory Board. 
From her fourth floor office in West Los Angeles, she has a spectacular view of 
city hills. 
</P>
<P>
She's in the office full time every day ("I started three days and worked up to 
five") and in love with marketing Max Factor products after failing in her own 
Chris Evert cosmetics line. She's also active in husband Leonard Goldberg's 
production company. He's the former president and chief operating officer of 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., and one of the major producers in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
And, she's working on the development of a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
With that, plus two college-age sons and a teen-age daughter -- "I'm a hands-on 
mother absolutely," she said -- wouldn't life be full? 
</P>
<P>
Not for Wendy Goldberg. Enriching Los Angeles is her bailiwick. "I try to be a 
hands-on volunteer." She was a founding member of the Filmex Society and served 
as president. She's involved with the Los Angeles Music Center where she helped 
establish the Entertainment Council in 1984. She's a long-time Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art patron. She's executive vice president of Cedars Sinai 
Women's Guild. She's a member of SHARE, the entertainment industry group that 
kicks up its heels in stage antics at its annual Boomtown benefit for disabled 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
But, her love this month is the California State Summer School for the Arts 
which will benefit from the Governor's Awards for the Arts Gala on Thursday at 
the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago Goldberg founded the summer school after being appointed to the 
California Arts Council by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. She's president of the 
CSSSA Foundation, and she talks nonstop about it. "I'm a great collaborator," 
she said, beginning to reel off a list of everyone who is helping on the 
current fund-raiser, including gala co-chairman Susan Dolgen (whose husband is 
new president of Columbia Pictures); Anne Johnson, coordinating chair of the 
benefit, and Joan Newberg, executive director of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Funds raised, both private and public, will provide scholarships for about half 
of the 400 talented youngsters who will attend the annual four-week summer 
school session in film and video, dance, drama, music, visual arts and creative 
writing. Full cost for a student is $2,300. "They eat-sleep their specialty," 
said Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
Summer school sessions have been held at CalArts twice, at Loyola Marymount 
once and at Mills College twice. Annually, a search is conducted throughout the 
state and 400,000 students are informed through brochures, videos and library 
posters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real process to educate the public . . . and raising money for the arts 
is very difficult, particularly this year, an election year," Goldberg said. 
"But I think (education) is preventive medicine; I'm passionate about 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Goldberg is so excited about talent at the summer schoolthat she and 
Susan Dolgen have asked Sacramento jazz singer Anita Jones, 19, a former summer 
school participant, to perform at the gala where Gov. and Mrs. George 
Deukmejian will be honoring arts leaders such as Lillian (Mrs. Walt) Disney, 
Frank Gehry and Sam Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"A star will be born," Wendy predicted. "We think she's so special. We're 
agenting her -- aren't we, Susan?" she said only half in jest. 
</P>
<P>
"And, also, please say we want this gala to become the Kennedy Center Honors of 
the West Coast."

<P>
TELEVISION: AFTER FOUR YEARS OF SHEARING SHEEP ON HER VALLEY FARM AND FISHING 
FOR SALMON IN ALASKA, SHE RETURNS TO CHANNEL 7 NOV. 1 TO ANCHOR THE 4 P.M. 
NEWS.

Few people would give up a high-paying job as one of Southern California's most 
popular TV anchors to learn how to shear and slaughter sheep, spin yarn, make 
paper and can food on a small suburban L.A. farm. Nor to spend summers without 
phones, television, washing machines or stores on an isolated, bear-infested 
island in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Lund did. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be thought of as a kook," she says. "But resourcefulness and 
learning skills and working with your hands, these hands, is something I have 
always admired terrifically. And to have been plopped down in the middle of Los 
Angeles with this wonderful job, I had a sense of becoming a caricature. I was 
sated, a glutton for everything that the material world presents us with." 
</P>
<P>
So in 1986, Lund walked away from her job as one of KABC Channel 7's news stars 
after helping to lead the station to a longstanding position of dominance. 
</P>
<P>
But after four years of spinning yarn at her eight-acre ranch in the San 
Fernando Valley and spending the summers with her two daughters hauling salmon 
out of the bay on her Alaskan island, Lund has decided that the material world 
is not so bad. Beginning Nov. 1, she will return to the air at Channel 7 to 
anchor the 4 p.m. news. 
</P>
<P>
Now in her 40s but still possessed of the white-blond hair and crisp blue eyes 
that once made her an anchor superstar, Lund says she is eager to once again 
expand the parameters of her world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful four years in which I did all of these domestic things so 
hard. I accomplished a lot of goals. And before, when Sarah and Dana (her 
daughters, ages 9 and 7) were so small, I wanted to experience the area that 
they were aware of. Now their awareness is vastly expanded. They are very 
conscious of the world. And I think my going back into the world is legitimate 
and positive for them and for me." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, though, the news business had become a rather negative world 
for all of them. During ratings periods when anchors actually get out from 
behind the studio desk to report special mini-docs on hot topics, Lund had 
worked on several series on domestic violence and child abuse. The horror, the 
ruined lives, the children "held hostage and summarily destroyed in vast 
numbers," she says, her eyes welling up with tears as she remembers it, 
consumed her thoughts all the time, seriously compromising the time she spent 
at home with her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
She knew she was missing things with her children and she began asking herself, 
for what? Compared to the social workers and counselors she found quietly 
working with abused children behind the headlines to help heal some of the 
wounds, Lund's own job, she says, began to seem meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
So, blessed with the financial riches that years in television had helped her 
procure, she dropped out to work with her hands, to learn self-reliance, to 
become a full-time mother, to experience some basic human connection to nature. 
</P>
<P>
"People thrive on that. I thrive on it, my kids thrive on it. I always hear 
them say, 'Gee, I really miss Alaska.' I never hear them say, 'I miss the 
traffic jams' or some other city thing. This is an important part of people, it 
always has been. It makes us all healthier and more positive and more cheerful 
and more resilient. That's awfully good for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
When the cheerier, healthier Lund sent out feelers about returning to TV, at 
least four local stations ponied up serious financial offers in an effort to 
lure her in front of their cameras. 
</P>
<P>
First, KCAL Channel 9 pursued her to head up its expanded prime-time news 
effort, but the station finally settled on Jerry Dunphy, Lund's one-time 
co-anchor at KABC, and a bevy of out-of-town faces. More recently, KCOP Channel 
13 made Lund what a station executive called a "very lucrative offer, perhaps 
even more than what she eventually got from KABC," to spearhead its own 
revamped news effort at 10 p.m. KNBC Channel 4 also wanted Lund as the 
centerpiece for a new 9 a.m. news program that the station has been developing. 
</P>
<P>
Lund settled on Channel 7, she says, for two reasons. First, "it's home. It's 
familiar. I have some wonderful relationships with the people there and it's 
like a great big kitchen with lots of chefs. I love that. And KABC has always 
seemed more flexible to me than some of the other stations. Something happens, 
they just go out and do it. They don't sit around and think about whether they 
should send out a crew or not. They just do it. Sure we make mistakes, but 
that's what makes it a terrifically exciting business. Sometimes you get there 
and it's just great." 
</P>
<P>
But the most important factor in choosing KABC was her children. Working at 
Channels 9 or 13 would have meant being on the air at 9 or 10 p.m., "the middle 
of the night as far as my kids were concerned," she says. The morning show at 
Channel 4 would have meant leaving the house around the time her children were 
just waking up. Anchoring the 4 p.m. news allows her to see her daughters off 
to school in the morning and to get home in time to participate in the family's 
dinner-time gossip. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Lund at her home, even when she is dressed up in her anchor finest for 
publicity photos, it is hard to picture her as a high-powered newswoman. She 
tells visitors that she is addicted to spinning yarn as she demonstrates the 
process on one of her many spinning wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse than heroin, and women back through the ages have known about it," 
she says as she stares at the whirling wheel and slides for a minute into a 
blissed-out trance. 
</P>
<P>
Her eldest daughter arrives home from school, disappointed that Mom is home to 
prevent her from sneaking in a new rabbit from the pound to join the menagerie 
of ducks, geese, chickens, sheep, dogs and horses that inhabit their little 
city farm. The younger one runs through the immaculately rustic living room 
carrying a white pet rat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a greater sense of calm now," Lund says, "and I do think that will help 
when I go back on the air. I have a better perspective on the world and what's 
important. I hope that comes through." 
</P>
<P>
Though she doesn't permit her children to watch television -- she'd rather see 
them playing and dreaming -- Lund has been watching local news herself during 
this long hiatus. She knows its limitations: that it can at best be a "headline 
service"; that it too often aims to be "too slick and too glib." But, while she 
truly wanted out four years ago, so much so that she went back to graduate 
school these last few years and is halfway toward her marriage and family 
counselor's license, she also says she has a renewed belief in the value of 
television news, especially since fewer and fewer people are reading newspapers 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think we need to mature and become more useful, more meaningful. 
Television has sometimes become too dependent on all the electronic gadgetry, 
become so slick for slick's sake, that we sometimes forget who we're talking 
to. Sure, we're the shovelers. We shovel this bit of information and then that 
one and drop it in front of them. But I think that's important to people. 
</P>
<P>
"What I love about being on the air live, what I have missed these last few 
years, is that feeling that I am talking straight to someone out there on the 
other side of the screen who has just come home from work and is putting his 
feet up and asking us to put some order to all the chaos he sees out there. I'm 
happy to help him do that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Christine Lund spent 13 years anchoring the news at KABC Channel 7, beginning 
in 1973. During much of that time, KABC's newscasts drew the largest audiences 
in the Los Angeles area. In 1986, feeling "burned out" and wanting to spend 
more time with her young daughters, she tried to negotiate a reduction in her 
work schedule, failed and so left the TV business entirely.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;

<P>
BODIE'S, LEGENDARY S.D. NIGHTCLUB, IS ROCKIN' AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's a small, dark, cubicle with a 22-foot-high ceiling and a wall-to-wall 
hardwood dance floor that vibrates from the relentless pounding of hundreds of 
happy feet. 
</P>
<P>
Along one wall is a bar; along another a carpeted stage, on which San Diego's 
finest original rock bands do their thing five nights a week, Wednesday through 
Sunday. Overlooking the stage is an L-shaped balcony with stools and chairs and 
tables for those who'd rather listen than dance, rather groove than move. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Bodie's, resurrected last month after a five-year absence, in a new 
location -- downtown on F Street, between 5th and 6th avenues -- by 30-year-old 
Brett Bodie. Brett's father, Harvey, ran the original Bodie's on University 
Avenue, just east of College Avenue, from 1981 until he lost his lease in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The old Bodie's was the equal of New York's CBGB's on the San Diego music 
scene. It was the place to go to hear up-and-coming local talent. "The Beat 
Farmers played there every weekend for a year and a half," Bodie recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Other regulars included DFX2, the Paladins, the Evasions, Playground Slap, and 
Mojo Nixon, who would later pay tribute to Bodie's in the song, "Positively 
Bodie's Parking Lot," on his 1987 album, "Bo-Day-Shus!!!" And the club's 
reputation was such that big names like R.E.M., Los Lobos, and the Blasters 
would drop in, unannounced, whenever they were in town. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Bodie is determined that the new Bodie's live up to the old one's legacy. 
As his father did, he's booking only local bands that play original material, 
like the Forbidden Pigs, Romy Kaye and the Swinging Gates, Burning Bridges, and 
Daddy Longlegs. He's also reserving Sunday nights for impromptu jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always wanted to reopen the club," Bodie said. "The old bar had a good 
rep with musicians, and they wanted it to happen so much that they supported 
it. On any given night, you could see a ton of musicians out in the crowd, and 
that's the same type of thing we want to get going again." 
</P>
<P>
The new Bodie's has only been open a month, but it's already "going again." One 
night, midway through Comanche Moon's set, Country Dick Montana of the Beat 
Farmers jumped on stage to sing a song or three. He was subsequently joined by 
singer-guitarist Bruce Thorpe of the Blonde Bruce Band -- and then, one by one, 
the rest of the Beat Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a musician's bar," Bodie said. "We did it before, and now, we're 
just redoing what we already did." 
</P>
<P>
The resurrection of Bodie's came about purely by accident. After the original 
club closed in 1985, the father-and-son team was left with Molly's, "a little 
dive bar, an old-timers' bar, downtown," Brett Bodie said. 
</P>
<P>
"A few months ago, our landlord told us we had to upgrade, and I said, 'Dad, if 
we're going to have to upgrade, why not bring back Bodie's?' " he said. "So we 
took out the drop ceiling, built a stage, and basically decided to redo the old 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is that this time, it's my shot -- my dad turned booking 
and management over to me. So now, I get to play off of his old thing, and he 
gets to play off of my knowledge. I grew up seeing all those great local bands 
from the late 1970s on up, at places like the Skeleton Club and Abbey Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to every kind of thing when San Diego had a good, thriving 
original-music scene, and I've been paying attention to local bands ever 
since." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Collins came up with a unusual plan to thwart ticket scalpers when he 
played the 2,200-seat Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets went on sale only 24 hours before the concert, with a limit of one 
randomly assigned ticket per person. At the box office, you had to show a photo 
ID and sign your name on a form; then you got a receipt. The night of the 
concert, you had to bring your ID and receipt back to the box office to pick up 
your ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The end result was that scalpers were effectively shut out from buying up the 
choicest seats and then reselling them at outrageous prices. If you bought a 
ticket, you had to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Could this be the shape of things to come? San Diego concert promoters (or 
those who do shows here) and concert-hall operators are doubtful: 
</P>
<P>
* Phil Quinn, executive vice president and general manager of the San Diego 
Sports Arena: "It may work in smaller venues, but it certainly wouldn't work in 
a venue as large as this one. In a venue with 5,000 or more seats, it would get 
chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
* Jeff Gaulton of Bill Silva Presents: "I think any attempt to clean up ticket 
scalping is commendable, but it remains to be seen whether this is a plan that 
can work across the board. We have no plans to implement a program like this 
here in San Diego, but you have to remember, the San Diego market doesn't have 
a history of concerts selling out and getting a lot of tickets scalped; it's 
not nearly as big a problem as it is in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
* Kenny Weissberg, promoter of the annual Concerts by the Bay series at 
Humphrey's on Shelter Island: "That's an extreme situation for someone like 
Phil Collins to play a 2,000-seat venue, so I don't think it's an idea that can 
be implemented under any circumstances other than something like that. And it 
doesn't apply to Humphrey's at all, because I don't have any people like Phil 
Collins playing here. I'm totally against ticket scalpers, but I think what 
Ticketmaster does, with limiting first-day sales to six tickets per person, is 
about as much as one could expect to do to combat ticket scalping." 
</P>
<P>
* Brian Murphy of Avalon Attractions, which promoted the Collins date at the 
Wiltern: "It can only be applied to very big acts that are playing small 
venues, where the demand is certainly going to exceed the supply of tickets. I 
think that's the only way it can work. And down here, if I had an artist of the 
stature of Phil Collins who wanted to play a Symphony Hall date, or a Civic 
Theater date, we could follow the same steps we instituted up there." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The Palomar Music Festival, scheduled for Sunday afternoon at 
Palomar College in San Marcos, has been canceled. Headliner Jimmy Cliff came 
down with respiratory problems and postponed the entire West Coast leg of his 
U.S. tour. Refunds are available at point of purchase. All is not lost, 
however: The Untouchables, who were to open for Cliff, will be appearing, 
instead, at the Hype in Loma Portal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Last month's ninth annual Entertainer Music Awards ceremony at the La Paloma 
Theater in Encinitas raised more than $4,700 for the Mary Lou Clack Center for 
Handicapped Children. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Nov. 17 for Bad Company's Dec. 14 appearance, 
with the Damn Yankees, at Golden Hall downtown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Santana, Thursday at the Starlight Bowl 
in Balboa Park; the Henry Rollins Band with the Fluid and Subsociety, Saturday 
at Iguanas in Tijuana; James Taylor, Sunday at San Diego State University's 
Open Air Theatre, and the Chambers Brothers, Monday at the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach.

CAMBODIA DANCE TROUPE MEMBERS REQUEST ASYLUM; 
</P>
<P>
DEFECTIONS: FOUR DANCERS FROM THE GROUP, WHICH PERFORMED AT THE L.A. FESTIVAL, 
LEAVE THE COMPANY WHILE ON A U.S. TOUR. 
</P>

<P>
Four members of the Cambodian Classical Dance Troupe, which performed here in 
September as part of the Los Angeles Festival before touring other U.S. cities, 
have left the company and are requesting political asylum, officials with the 
company confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Blumenthal, executive producer of the tour, said three dancers defected 
in St. Paul, where the company had been booked for one performance last 
Tuesday. One more dancer, Mas Adi Meas, 23, defected in Lowell, Mass., Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
John McAuliff, director of the Philadelphia-based U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation 
Project, which worked with L.A. Festival officials to secure the entry visas 
for the company, said he and his associates had talked with all of the 
defectors, but did not know the true reasons behind their seeking asylum. He 
said the dancers were citing personal reasons and the difficulty of life in 
Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Festival officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but 
both Blumenthal and McAuliff said there were no problems or attempted 
defections while the group was in Los Angeles. McAuliff also said he had "made 
clear to them that we would not do anything to stop them from staying here." 
</P>
<P>
But Narim Kem, editor of the Long Beach-based Cambodian newspaper Serey Pheap, 
said he had talked with dancers during their L.A. visit who had wanted to 
defect, but that the security was too tight. 
</P>
<P>
"The festival was very, very careful, and did everything they could to keep 
them here," Kem said. "Some of them wanted to escape already, but they didn't 
have any opportunity while they were here." 
</P>
<P>
The company, based in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, had not appeared in 
the United States since 1971 because the U.S. government does not recognize the 
war-torn country or its Vietnamese-installed government. The eight-city U.S. 
tour -- in its final stop with performances through Sunday at New York's Joyce 
Theater -- was organized after the company was granted its historically 
important visitors visas for the L.A. Festival performances. The visit marks 
the first cultural exchange between the U.S. and Cambodia since the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal said that metal detectors will screen the audience at the remaining 
New York performances, which continue through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Dancers are prisoners with police escorts at all times," Blumenthal said. 
"What was so good about the tour was that it rose above factional conflict for 
the period the company was here; all Cambodians could just celebrate together 
and forget that they'd been fighting each other for over for 20 years. And now 
that's been tainted."

STRAIT REPEATS AS ENTERTAINER OF YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY MUSIC: NEWCOMERS DOMINATE THE LIST OF NOMINEES AND WINNERS AT 24TH 
ANNUAL AWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
George Strait repeated as entertainer of the year in the Country Music Assn.'s 
24th annual awards ceremony Monday night in Nashville, but the emphasis 
otherwise was on newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
There were so many new faces among the key nominees and winners, in fact, that 
co-host Randy Travis -- who has sold 10 million albums since his first Top 20 
country hit just four years ago -- seemed very much an elder statesman. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolic of the dramatic changing of the guard in the commercial ranks of 
country music these days, most of the artists who dominated the competition 
have had only one or two albums on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
They included: 
</P>
<P>
* Clint Black, a gritty, neo-honky-tonk singer who was named best male vocalist 
after winning the best newcomer award last year. 
</P>
<P>
* Garth Brooks, another member of country's growing new traditionalist 
contingent. He won best newcomer and best music video awards. 
</P>
<P>
* The Kentucky Headhunters, a quintet with a somewhat radical 
backwoods/garage-band style that impressed voters enough to earn them the best 
vocal group and best album awards. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore the domination of newcomers in the balloting, which is determined 
by the 6,000 members of the association, that threesome plus newcomer Alan 
Jackson -- whose debut album, "Here in the Real World," has been in the country 
Top 10 since June -- received more than a dozen other nominations. 
</P>
<P>
So, it's easy to understand Strait's surprise when he was named entertainer of 
the year, defeating a group of nominees that included Black, Travis and Ricky 
Van Shelton (whose first hit was in 1987). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm truly speechless. I really don't have a speech," said Strait, accepting 
the award during a two-hour telecast from the Grand Ole Opry House. 
</P>
<P>
Backstage, Strait, a 38-year-old former cattle rancher from Texas, added, "I 
was pretty surprised. Two times is pretty awesome. It was very stiff 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Black also mentioned the strong competition -- and the new crop of country 
stars -- during interviews backstage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole wave of country artists coming out . . . ," he said. "But you 
always want something new, and that's what's happening now. There's more new 
country in the stores than you can buy in one day." 
</P>
<P>
There was still room in the balloting, however, for some more veterans. The 
Judds were honored as best vocal duo, marking the sixth straight time that the 
team of mother Naomi and daughter Wynonna has been named either best duo or 
vocal group. And Kathy Mattea was declared best female vocalist for the second 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the evening's most emotional moments, Lorrie Morgan accepted the 
"vocal event" award for " 'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose," on which she sang with 
her late husband, Keith Whitley. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Gill's "When I Call Your Name" was judged the year's best country single, 
while Jon Venzer and Don Henry's "Where've You Been" was named best song. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee Ernie Ford, who had more than a dozen Top 10 country singles in the 
1950s and '60s, was named to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Ford, 71, was also 
a popular television performer who helped expand the audience for country 
music. His biggest hit was "Sixteen Tons," which was No. 1 on both the pop and 
country charts in 1955.

<P>
In the Arabian desert, reveille comes by air. Clouds of pesky flies buzz in at 
first light, the beginning of a daylong torment. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath an umbrella of Marine Corps camouflage, Lance Cpl. Lawry Cuthbert fends 
off the attackers with his shower shoe. Some miles away, Army Staff Sgt. 
Raymond Horne takes his aim with a piece of cardboard wrapped in tape. Horne 
has plenty of time to swat flies: His official job is persuading soldiers to 
re-enlist. So far, he says, there have been no takers. 
</P>
<P>
The adrenaline rush of deployment has ebbed. 
</P>
<P>
Staging scorpion fights has become a bore. Cleaning sand from rifles no longer 
focuses the mind. Even combat drills and mock battles staged under 
once-unfamiliar conditions smack of lessons long-since learned. 
</P>
<P>
As the massive U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia enters its third month, 
the great challenge facing thousands of ordinary American soldiers dug in 
across this bleak moonscape has become the emptiness of their days. And, 
frustrated by uncertainty about what the future will bring and when, the 
patience of front-line American troops has begun to fray. 
</P>
<P>
"It all comes down to this: We should either go fight or we should go home," 
Cpl. Steve Ellis, a 25-year-old Army infantryman from Appleton, Wis., said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"You might just say we're all getting a little antsy now," said Ellis' 
20-year-old squad mate, Pfc. Rod Terrill of Tucson, as he brushed the sand off 
yet another cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
These untested troops also have time to wonder about the realities of war and 
how they will meet them if combat comes. It is at night, says a former Army 
Special Forces officer who fought in Vietnam and now serves as a chaplain to a 
Marine battalion here, when the troops most often approach to ask what war is 
really like. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a lot of death, a lot of destruction, a lot of horror, really," says 
Navy Lt. Dan Hall, who became a Roman Catholic priest in reaction to what he 
saw in Vietnam. He says he told one Marine the other day: "When you see me 
start to worry, then you worry." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting is rarely easy, but a grunt's life in Saudi Arabia is particularly 
trying. Soldiers and officers at the forward-most U.S. positions say they are 
sustained by letters and news of public support from the folks back home. After 
weeks in the sand, they find comfort in little else. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is no sign of outright dissension. Many soldiers speak with 
vehemence about the importance they attach to their pledge to serve the nation. 
If some question why their President has ordered them to this bleak place, most 
quickly add that it is not for them to doubt. 
</P>
<P>
But with tens of thousands of Saddam Hussein's heavily armored troops 
entrenched just across the border and no clear indication whether the Americans 
will be asked to drive them out, the strain of waiting shows. Corporals say 
captains have failed to tell the whole story. In the absence of ready answers 
to the endless questions, tempers sometimes flare and rumors fly. 
</P>
<P>
For GIs, the rare recreational break means little more than swapping one 
isolated compound for another. And Saudi Arabia's cultural strictures always 
intrude: Not only are alcohol and women off limits, but even Sports Illustrated 
is banned for baring too much skin. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it," says one commander, whose 82nd Airborne company was one of 
the first to be deployed here nearly two months ago, "but most of my guys just 
want to go home." 
</P>
<P>
The scorching afternoon on which infantryman Ellis spoke marked his squad's 
first opportunity to stand down after more than 40 days of manning a 
107-millimeter mortar pointed toward Iraq. The rare chance to relax consisted 
of watching "The Godfather" on videotape and drinking cold sodas -- all in 
stifling tents just a quarter mile back from the big gun. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the 170,000 American military personnel in the Persian Gulf theater 
have it so grim. For sailors, there is occasional shore leave with the prospect 
at least of a beer in Bahrain. The Air Force, when not in air-conditioned 
barracks, sleeps in air-conditioned tents. The Army's entire 101st Airborne 
Division is housed in a vast tent city, a dusty, primitive sprawl that at least 
provides regular showers and other home-base amenities. 
</P>
<P>
But for those infantrymen and tankers, ammunition haulers and mechanics whose 
small encampments compose the front lines, there is no such relief. A bed is a 
cot under camouflage or a mattress on a tank. Meals, while sometimes hot, are 
rarely recognizable. Showers arrive by truck. 
</P>
<P>
The lucky ones rotate back to climate-controlled base camps for a couple days 
every two weeks. But grunts like Ellis in the 197th Infantry Regiment got their 
first break only last week -- the two-day stint in so-called Panther's 
Paradise, where soldiers still sleep 34 to a stifling tent. 
</P>
<P>
And while commanders seek to crowd the days with classes and calisthenics, 
meals and make-work, soldiers say there can never be enough to fill the empty 
hours. They read or write letters or play cards. Some lift weights fashioned 
from ropes and water cans. But in the end, they say, the boredom is unrelieved. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of settin' and waitin'," says Marine Sgt. John Kaneaster, whose 
job is to repair the rifles of the 1st Tank Battalion whenever they break down. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he and Cuthbert, the shower-shoe wielding tank mechanic, spend most of 
their time these days sitting around the dusty compound, a ghost town in the 
sand, hiding from the fierce sun under netting and waging war upon the flies 
who try to share their shade. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it's a game," says Cuthbert, a 20-year-old from Lakeview Terrace in Los 
Angeles. "I kill as many as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Others hunt half-heartedly for scorpions and camel spiders. The arachnids are 
set upon one another in title bouts that once seemed exciting. As the thrill of 
those fierce fights has faded, most soldiers say they would rather listen to 
music than mount another search. 
</P>
<P>
Now that cooler weather has set in, there is less nocturnal training. Days 
begin at dawn -- unless the flies arrive first. By 5:30 a.m., American soldiers 
across the front lines are face down in the dust, finishing up the mandatory 
push-ups before a few innings of softball in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast arrives by 7 a.m., hauled in from the rear. The food is heaped in 
lumpy piles on flimsy Styrofoam trays. Later, there may be sand-table classes 
on Iraqi tactics, even realistic training exercises that pit Marine against 
Marine. 
</P>
<P>
But more often, the day in the desert means sitting in a foxhole, on guard 
against a so-far dormant Iraqi enemy. Or cleaning one more rifle. Or changing 
yet another sand-clogged filter in another Humvee jeep. And, soldiers say, 
officers can always find another berm in need of building or another sandbag 
for a private to fill. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to keep us busy," shrugs Sgt. Michael Londergan, whose days are spent 
shuttling supplies of ammunition and spare parts to the combat troops he 
serves. 
</P>
<P>
After an afternoon reprise, quitting time comes early to take advantage of 
fading light. There may be time for one last workout or writing a letter home 
in the desert dusk. But darkness falls by 6 p.m, and a blackout is enforced. 
Even with games of spades and nighttime weightlifting, the hours stretch on. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about the desert," says Lance Cpl. Derrick Farwell, a 21-year-old 
Camp Pendleton-based Marine scout, "is that there's not a lot of external 
stimulation to get the old noodle going. Your mind just wanders." 
</P>
<P>
Most try to focus on anything but the obvious. It is wives and girlfriends that 
soldiers' thoughts gravitate to, along with cars and motorcycles and the 
almost-forgotten delights of fresh food and ice-cold drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the crew of "Bad Company," the Marines' name for a light armored LAV-25 
vehicle that would charge across the battlefield in the early stages of a tank 
war, the nightly topic revolves around the relative merits of filet mignon and 
lobster. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer the lobster myself," says Cpl. John Harvey, Bad Company's New 
England-born gunner. The commander is an Oklahoman, though, and he argues the 
merits of "real beef for real Marines." 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Army mortar platoon, between late-night yawns on watch, Ellis and 
Terrill seek a silver lining in the monotony, planning aloud what they will do 
with earnings they now have little way to spend. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be like, 'Hey, Rod, are you still going to put those new seats in your 
truck?' " Ellis says. Sooner or later, though, even such daydreaming gets down 
to the basics. "Back home I drive a '65 Buick Riviera with a 425," he says. "I 
can't afford to pay $1.50 a gallon." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking about simple pleasures sometimes also just makes their absence felt. 
"We've got nothing out here," says Londergan, the Army sergeant from Corning, 
N.Y., surveying terrain broken only by scattered camouflage nets. 
</P>
<P>
"Women and beer," he says. "You take that away from a man and what else is 
there?" 
</P>
<P>
The waiting also makes it harder for soldiers to remember why they are here. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell myself again and again: 'You signed that contract,' " says 
Horne, the fly-swatting Army sergeant. " 'You promised to support and defend 
the Constitution of the United States.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's what goes through my mind every day," the sergeant says, a gold tooth 
gleaming in the sun. "Why am I here? Why am I here?" 
</P>
<P>
As the initial bravado about "kicking ass and taking gas" dissipates, other 
troops across the desert said they were beginning to ask the same question. And 
frustration with defending against an Iraqi force that shows no interest in 
invading and orders that give no permission to attack has inspired a certain 
revisionism. 
</P>
<P>
"They say we're here to defend Saudi Arabia and drive Saddam out of Kuwait," 
one Army sergeant says as a squad of infantrymen around him nods in agreement. 
"The thing about it is, Kuwait used to be his land. Why can't he have his land 
back?" 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant was referring to a claim by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that 
Kuwait is part of Iraq because Kuwait and southern Iraq were administered as 
the same province of Basra in the Ottoman Empire before World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Following the war, both Kuwait and Iraq were administered by Britain under a 
League of Nations mandate in which Kuwait and Basra province of Iraq were 
separated. Kuwait received its independence from Britain on June 19, 1961, and 
survived as an independent nation until the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In other units, talk has spread that the United States in the 1950s sought and 
failed to win permission to establish a permanent base here. Maybe, soldiers 
say, that explains their current predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was not an independent nation in the 1950s. Since then, the United 
States has, from time to time, sought basing rights in the gulf region. For 
instance, Bahrain serves as home port to the U.S. Navy's Persian Gulf task 
force. Kuwait, which since independence sought to maintain a neutral foreign 
policy, has never permitted any foreign bases on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam tipped it off, I know," says the Army's Londergan. "But the longer we 
stay, the more I start to think the President was just looking for a reason to 
get a grip on all the oil." 
</P>
<P>
"Just to grab a piece of the rock," echoes Spec. Michael Douglas, of 
Youngstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
And the longer the U.S. forces sit in place to defend Saudi Arabia, the more 
some soldiers wonder why they must stay here at all. "All they need now is a 
peacekeeping force," one Marine corporal says. "If they need us, we can come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
There are no signs that such complaints have yet diminished combat readiness; 
the discontent, soldiers say, only makes them more eager to get the job done 
fast. And for every voice of cynicism, there are several who -- at least to 
reporters -- profess wholehearted commitment to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"America's got to do its part to protect the free world from tyrants like 
Saddam Hussein," said Lance Cpl. James Morgan of Dayton, Ohio, the squad leader 
in a Marine anti-tank missile platoon. 
</P>
<P>
But other soldiers say weeks at close quarters with little outlet have left 
nerves raw and tempers worn, prompting periodic flare-ups. Short of blows, the 
play becomes more physical, with an entire platoon observed recently sprinting 
across the sandy dunes to tackle and pile on top of one hapless young private. 
</P>
<P>
Army officers wearily explain that the game is known as "911" -- the universal 
code for help. "You can 911 all you want to," a fed-up staff sergeant shouts at 
his men as he seeks to disentangle the mob. "But no more of this dog-pile 
bull----." 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty about what lies ahead touches off waves of late-night gossiping 
and grousing. Lately, the whispering has produced the slogan "Go home or go 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the ubiquitous rumors. Why won't the officers tell us what is 
going on? soldiers ask. In the past two weeks, commanders have been forced to 
stand before assembled soldiers to deny, variously, that Saddam Hussein is 
dead, that American servicemen were killed in a terror attack, and that a date 
has been set for their flight home. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers really feel like we're holding out on them," one Army company 
commander says. "Their morale has really dropped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Another commander said some of the frustration has been channeled at the host 
government, with soldiers confused by conflicting signals suggesting that "the 
Saudis want us here and at the same time don't want us here." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated soldiers recount stories of the private whose parents sent him a 
religious medal but the box arrived empty, or the sergeant whose buddies sent 
him a skin magazine, but Saudi censors inked over all the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"They wonder why, here we are supposedly protecting their freedom and 
everything, but we're still stuck in this little encampment," says Lt. Col. 
Matt Belford, whose battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the first 
dispatched to the front lines in Saudi Arabia, is now in an isolated facility 
in the rear. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, no matter what we do, we are basically two cultures, and we're 
not going to mix," Belford says. 
</P>
<P>
There remain some who insist they are content with things as they are now. 
Marine Lance Cpl. Farwell, who plans to buy a new motorcycle with all the money 
he saves, is assigned to a scout platoon that would likely bear the first shock 
of a gas attack. He points to the chemical suit above his driver's seat to make 
clear he is in no hurry for fighting to break out.

FIRST 9 JAPANESE WWII INTERNEES GET REPARATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a moving, emotional ceremony, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh knelt Tuesday and 
presented an entire nation's apology to Mamoru Eto, a wheelchair-bound, 
107-year-old Japanese-American minister who was forcibly interned during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, handing out $20,000 redress payments to nine elderly internees, the 
first of about 65,000 Japanese-Americans who eventually will receive them, told 
the recipients that, even when the American "system failed you, you never lost 
your faith in it." 
</P>
<P>
"By finally admitting a wrong, a nation does not destroy its integrity but, 
rather, reinforces the sincerity of its commitment to the Constitution and 
hence to its people," the attorney general said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can never fully right the wrongs of the past," President Bush declared in a 
two-paragraph statement accompanying each check. "But we can take a clear stand 
for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to 
Japanese-Americans during World War II." 
</P>
<P>
Two Californian congressmen, Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose), and Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento), brushed tears from their eyes and embraced as the 
audience in the Justice Department's Great Hall sang "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Mineta, who was interned as a 10-year-old in a camp at Heart Mountain, Wyo., 
said: "Americans of Japanese ancestry now know in their hearts that the letter 
and spirit of our Constitution holds true for them." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who lost his right arm fighting in Europe 
with the Japanese-American 442nd Regiment, had to dry his eyes after greeting 
Eto, a resident of a Los Angeles nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
"We honor ourselves and honor America," Inouye said. "We demonstrated to the 
world that we are a strong people -- strong enough to admit our wrongs." 
</P>
<P>
Eto, who was minister of the First Japanese Nazarene Church in Pasadena when he 
was sent in 1942 to the Tulare Assembly Center and then to the Gila River 
(Ariz.) Internment Camp, said through his son, David, that he has no immediate 
plans for the money he received. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Eto, a resident of the Minami Keiro Nursing Home in Los Angeles, 
delivered the ceremony's opening invocation in Japanese. His son said he has 
forgotten the little English he once commanded. 
</P>
<P>
David Eto, 59, a Woodland Hills engineer for Hughes Aircraft Corp.'s Missile 
Systems division who later will receive his own $20,000 payment, agreed with 
most recipients that the symbolism of the government's action outweighs the 
dollars involved. 
</P>
<P>
Tsyako (Sox) Kitashima, 72, of San Francisco, who personally mailed more than 
25,000 letters in support of redress, expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
Kitashima was 23 when she was sent to a camp at Topaz, Utah, carrying as much 
of her belongings as she could cram into the two suitcases allowed by 
government officials. She said that for thousands of Japanese-Americans, the 
redress and apology "hopefully will unburden the stigma of disloyalty" that 
resulted from the forced relocation. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was the first recipient, Mamoru Eto is not the oldest. Robert 
Bratt, who runs the office of redress administration in the Justice 
Department's civil rights division, plans to present a Phoenix woman who will 
be 108 next month with a check in a private ceremony later this week. The 
woman, who declined use of her name, is suffering from a toothache and is 
considered too fragile to travel to Washington, Bratt said. 
</P>
<P>
The redress program was mandated by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. The 
$20,000 payments and letter of apology are to be provided to the 65,000 
internees who were living when the law was passed, or to their heirs. About 
120,000 Japanese-Americans were interned during the war. 
</P>
<P>
The payments, expected to exceed $1.5 billion, are to be completed in fiscal 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies honoring other senior recipients are planned Thursday in Chicago; 
Friday in Los Angeles and Fresno; Saturday in San Francisco, Sacramento and San 
Jose; Sunday in Seattle, and Monday in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Other recipients who participated in Tuesday's ceremony were Hau Dairiki, 102, 
of Sacramento; Kisa Iseri, 102, of Ontario, Ore.; Hisano Fujimoto, 101, of 
Lombard, Ill.; Senkichi Yuge, 101, of Los Angeles; Sugi Kiriyama, 100, of West 
Los Angeles; Sade Ide, 90, of Arlington, Va.; Don Hatsuki Shima, 86, of Laurel, 
Md., and Ken Yamamoto, 73, of Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
On their way up the stairs to the Great Hall, recipients and other participants 
passed wall murals of some of civilization's leading exponents of law and 
justice -- Hammurabi, Moses, Solon, Justinian, Thomas Aquinas, John Marshall 
and Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
But the wartime Justice Department departed from the principles those men 
espoused in its active support of the relocation and internment program. 
Thornburgh, in his comments, said he is "not unmindful of the historic role 
this department I now lead played in the internment. It is somehow entirely 
fitting that it is here where we now celebrate redress."

MATSUSHITA'S ISRAEL BOYCOTT MAY CLOUD BID FOR MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s participation in an Arab-led boycott of 
Israel could complicate its efforts to purchase MCA Inc., whose chairman, Lew 
R. Wasserman, is one of Hollywood's leading supporters of Jewish and Israeli 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita's policy, which has not been widely publicized, bars the Japanese 
electronics giant from conducting any direct trade with Israel. That policy 
would technically prevent Matsushita from selling MCA's movies and television 
shows to Israel. But U.S. law forbids American companies, even those owned by 
foreign firms, to comply with the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from both MCA and Matsushita declined to comment on the policy. One 
individual familiar with the talks said MCA won't change its policy of dealing 
with Israel even if acquired by Matsushita, but neither does it plan to end the 
talks because of Matsushita's stance. Other individuals said Matsushita 
executives, queried about the boycott, have shown no willingness to end their 
participation in the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Jewish activists, however, said that unless the sanctions are lifted, 
Wasserman will be quietly pressured to get out of the deal, which could be 
worth more than $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a mega-deal," said Jess Hordes, Washington director of 
B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League. "It would not be inappropriate for Mr. 
Wasserman or any corporate executive to explore the implications of the 
boycott. We'll try to alert him to the possible problems that could be created 
linking up with a company with this kind of policy." 
</P>
<P>
Jewish activists said Matsushita, based in Osaka, has been a loyal adherent of 
the Arab boycott, which also prohibits the electronics firm from opening stores 
or production facilities in Israel. Failure to follow the restrictions, in 
effect since 1951, can result in economic reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies around the world also participate in the boycott, which is 
designed to weaken Israel's economy. But Jewish leaders say the Japanese are 
particularly cooperative, presumably because of their country's heavy reliance 
on oil from Arab nations. Toyota, Nissan, Hitachi, Minolta and Olympus are 
among the other major Japanese firms that honor the boycott, according to 
Jewish organizations, such as the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League and the 
American Jewish Congress, that monitor a list maintained by the Israeli 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The Matsushita name was little known to the American public until the company 
began discussing a bid to buy Los Angeles-based MCA, which owns Universal 
Studios, theme parks, real estate, record labels and other interests. 
Matsushita, whose products are sold under the Panasonic, Technics and JVC 
labels, reported profits of $1.6 billion on sales of $44 billion last fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Will Maslow, special counsel to the American Jewish Congress and editor of the 
group's monthly Boycott Report, said Matsushita's Panasonic products are widely 
available in Israel but only through third-party American distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese companies have more boldly sidestepped the boycott. Honda sells 
cars in Israel through its American division. Sony Corp., which purchased 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Corp. for $3.4 billion last year, sells its 
products directly out of a store in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-Israeli relations have gradually improved in recent years. The two 
countries agreed to explore possible economic and technological collaboration 
late last year after then-Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens made a rare 
five-day visit to Japan. But the boycott issue remains as a sore point, 
especially among Jewish activists living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Maslow's Washington-based Boycott Report regularly monitors changes in policy. 
Several Jewish organizations in Los Angeles have also recently organized around 
the boycott issue. A position paper from the groups names Japan as "the worst 
offender" of any industrialized nation. Members have been encouraged to engage 
in an anti-boycott letter-writing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
American companies have been barred from participating in the boycott since 
1977 under the federal Export-Import Act of that year. "(Violators) are subject 
to, I believe, both criminal and civil penalties. . . . That's fairly 
straightforward," UCLA international law professor Arthur Rosett said of the 
U.S. anti-boycott rules. The United States is Israel's biggest international 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders may be hesitant to directly challenge Wasserman, however. At 77, 
the MCA chairman is a revered figure in the Jewish and Israeli communities. One 
Jewish leader in Southern California said Wasserman is a significant 
contributor to such causes as the United Jewish Fund, an umbrella humanitarian 
organization, and Operation Exodus, which helps Russian Jews emigrate to 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg is also a substantial contributor to Jewish 
causes, as is Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, who has served as 
Matsushita's representative in its talks with MCA. Those ties have led to some 
discomfort in Hollywood as word of Matsushita's Israeli sanctions have leaked 
out. But thus far it is difficult to determine what impact the revelation will 
have on the purchase discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sheinberg and Ovitz declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish leaders said it is quite possible that Wasserman, Sheinberg and 
Ovitz knew nothing of the anti-Israeli policy when they entered into the 
discussions. MCA now appears prepared to take the position that the boycott 
won't affect the acquisition talks. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, the current company line is that the studio won't stop doing 
business with Israel even if acquired by Matsushita, but neither will it kill a 
deal over the parent company's stance. 
</P>
<P>
"Their corporate politics at Matsushita won't have any effect on MCA's 
politics," one individual familiar with the talks predicted. 
</P>
<P>
One longtime Wasserman friend, informed of Matsushita's boycott, predicted that 
the deal is more likely to be jeopardized by Japanese sensitivity to renewed 
attention to the boycott than by any reaction at MCA. "It's the Japanese 
company that may say, 'Who needs this?' . . . They are very sensitive to the 
way they're perceived in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
MCA has continued to enforce a blackout on the talks. The company's top 
officers had been scheduled to meet Matsushita executives in New York last 
Sunday. But several individuals close to the company speculated that 
face-to-face meetings had been shifted to Los Angeles and might be under way 
already with Matsushita representatives, if not its president, Akio Tanii. 
</P>
<P>
MCA stock fell $2.75 a share Tuesday to close at $56.125 as 567,900 shares 
changed hands in New York Stock Exchange trading. Analysts said the decline 
reflected a weak market and a lack of information about MCA's talks with 
Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's (professional speculators) getting nervous about a lack of 
information flow," said Lisbeth Barron, an entertainment analyst with S. G. 
Warburg Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the course of the discussions, however, it is apparent that 
Matsushita's boycott policy will now be among the items on the table. Rabbi 
Laura Geller of the American Jewish Congress in Los Angeles said it's a 
legitimate issue for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
"People would love MCA to use this opportunity to perhaps raise questions about 
these larger issues," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Groups like ours continue to remind Japanese business that there should be no 
barriers to free and open trade between nations, and we will continue to do so 
until all such barriers disappear," said Neil Sandberg of the American Jewish 
Committee's Pacific Rim Institute. "The point will be raised that (Matsushita) 
should freely and openly trade with Israel."

BUSH ALTERS TAX STAND, BACKS OFF; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE PRESIDENT FIRST SAYS HE MIGHT OK A HIGHER RATE FOR THE RICH. BUT HE 
IS SAID TO LATER REJECT THE OPTION.

<P>
President Bush, still searching for a way out of the budget crisis, reversed 
position twice Tuesday on whether he would agree to raise income tax rates for 
the rich as Congress began work on a new budget package that may not be 
finished until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
During a press conference Tuesday morning, Bush appeared to signal that he 
might be willing to abandon his previous stance and accept a trade-off with 
Democrats that would reduce taxes on capital gains while raising tax rates for 
wealthy taxpayers, saying that if it could be "worked in proper balance . . , 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few hours later, however, during a meeting with 16 Republican Senate 
leaders who opposed any such agreement, the President reportedly switched 
positions again, rejecting any talk of such a deal, participants in the session 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked us what we thought. It was unanimous. We all put up our hands and 
said, 'no deal,' " said Sen. Bob Packwood, the senior Republican on the 
tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. "If the price of a capital gains cut is 
going up on the rates, then no deal." 
</P>
<P>
Bush "agreed with that concept," said Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). "It's done, 
there's no way." 
</P>
<P>
The apparently conflicting positions came as, separately, Senate Finance 
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) unveiled his own plan for just such a 
trade-off that paralleled what Bush had said earlier that he might endorse. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's plan, to be presented to his panel today, also proposes reducing the 
10-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax contained in the old bipartisan budget accord to 
9 cents a gallon and eliminating a proposed 2-cent-a-gallon tax on home heating 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
It also would ease the proposed increases in Medicare costs to the elderly by 
limiting the increase in the deductible to $100, instead of the $150 proposed 
before (It's now $75) and trimming back the proposed rise in Medicare premiums. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're trying to get to where we don't hit the average-income person 
so much," Bentsen told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The trade-off that Bentsen is proposing would reduce the tax on capital gains 
-- profits from the sale of stocks or other assets -- to 23%, from the current 
28%, while raising income tax rates for those earning $200,000 or more to 33%, 
from 28% now. 
</P>
<P>
In another proposed change, Bentsen would raise the alternative minimum tax 
paid by some wealthy taxpayers from 21% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
While Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), Bentsen's House counterpart as chairman 
of the House Ways and Means Committee, has not expressed his views on a 
second-time-around tax package, the two powerful chairmen met Tuesday to 
discuss how to break the budget deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of developments left the budget situation confused again 
Tuesday -- and both sides increasingly skeptical that the lawmakers will be 
able to put together an acceptable budget plan before the Nov. 6 elections -- 
pointing to a possible lame-duck session this fall. 
</P>
<P>
During weeks of budget summit talks, White House negotiators repeatedly had 
rejected any sort of trade-off involving capital gains taxes and tax increases 
for the rich. Yet, Bush indicated that he would accept it, after it was 
endorsed by House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But he apparently reversed himself in the afternoon after talking with Senate 
Republican leaders. While Bush was meeting with the senators, his chief of 
staff, John H. Sununu, told businessmen who had lobbied for the capital gains 
cut that the idea is dead. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Sununu) was pretty hard on that line," an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
House Republicans have said they would support the trade-off that Bush and the 
Senate Republicans have rejected. Sunday, in a straw poll at a party caucus, 
roughly two-thirds of the 176 GOP members in the House voted to support such a 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of contradictory events underlines the disarray into which the White 
House and the GOP have plunged in the wake of the collapse of last week's 
budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Bush and many other Republicans believe that cutting taxes on 
capital gains would spur economic growth and help them politically. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats have insisted that the cut, which would primarily benefit wealthy 
Americans, must be balanced by increased taxes on the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush's advisers, led by Sununu, have said that they are convinced any move 
to increase rates would be only the first step toward dismantling the low tax 
rates that have been the hallmark of GOP economic policy for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, tax analysts say that whatever economic benefits might flow from 
the trade-off, it probably would leave affluent Americans paying even less in 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the relief provided to upper-income taxpayers by reduced 
rates on capital gains would be greater than the increase they would suffer 
from the higher tax rates for ordinary income. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the analysts say that rejuggling the disparate rates would 
make it more attractive for upper-income taxpayers to try to escape the higher 
general tax rates by converting more of their ordinary income into investments. 
</P>
<P>
As that fight plays out, both the White House and congressional leaders remain 
unsure of how to produce a budget package that can pass Congress in the 
remaining days before the current stopgap funding measure runs out Oct. 19. 
Bush signed that measure Tuesday, allowing all federal workers to return to 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 19 deadline, in turn, is expected to increase pressure for Bush and 
congressional leaders to push the whole debate over until after the November 
election, bringing the lawmakers back for a lame-duck session. 
</P>
<P>
Some aides say that Bush now seems likely to sign a new stopgap measure that 
would continue to finance government operations until mid-autumn. Earlier, he 
had vowed not to renew the current authority. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the House overwhelmingly rejected the budget package produced 
by months of closed-door negotiations between the White House and congressional 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional committees are now supposed to produce a new budget plan in just 
three days and Congress is scheduled to complete action just a week later. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have time for major surgery," said Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.). He 
said the only way to produce a budget is to stick close to the original plan. 
</P>
<P>
But both White House and congressional leaders concede that the political 
pressures that encouraged members of the House to balk at that plan Friday will 
only grow stronger as the election gets closer. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, the possibility of a lame-duck session -- notoriously an 
unruly and contentious sort of gathering -- is now being taken seriously both 
in the White House and on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not be able to avoid it," said one White House aide. The chances "are 
increasing," said Sen. John H. Chaffee (R-R.I.). 
</P>
<P>
Bush, at his press conference, pointedly declined to say that he would veto a 
new stop-gap spending bill to extend budget deadlines until after the election. 
A veto would come only "if I felt that it would constructively lead to getting 
the problem solved," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget resolution passed Monday by Congress calls, in theory, for $40 
billion in deficit reductions during the current fiscal year and $500 billion 
over five years. But the details must be filled in over the next several days 
by congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, the deficit would be cut by three major moves -- 
reductions in military spending, which are now relatively non-controversial; 
cuts in the costs of entitlement programs, primarily Medicare and agricultural 
subsidies; and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
During his press conference, Bush said that higher tax rates for the wealthy 
was "on the table." 
</P>
<P>
"If it's proper, if it can be worked in proper balance between the capital 
gains tax rate and income tax changes, fine."

<P>
BROWN SEEKS TO TIE HAYES TO CLAIMS OF BOND MONEY MISUSE 
</P>

California Health Facilities Financing Authority, incumbent Treasurer Thomas W. 
Hayes and others are being sued by two counties for allegedly mismanaging a 
$200-million health facilities bond issue, according to documents released 
Tuesday by Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz and Stanislaus counties contend in the unusual legal action that 
they have lost millions in interest payments while investment bankers, brokers 
and even the health facilities' authority have reaped huge financial benefits 
from handling the $200-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue touches the administrations of the three officials who have held 
the office since 1986: the late Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, who died in August, 
1987; Elizabeth M. Whitney, a former Unruh aide who served as acting treasurer, 
and Hayes, who was confirmed in January, 1989, and is running for the office as 
a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
The Hayes campaign immediately denounced the release, contending that both the 
lawsuit and Brown's press statements were politically motivated and meant to 
embarrass Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes aides, in turn, released a petition filed by the office of Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat, seeking to dismiss the case. It argues, in 
part, that "it is highly likely that Hayes was named solely for the damage it 
could bring to him and his reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the suit, which was filed in San Jose and alleges securities 
fraud, asks a federal court to freeze interest earnings from the $200-million 
proceeds of the health facilities bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, only $56 million of the $200 million has actually been lent to 
nonprofit agencies to construct health facilities. The counties contend that a 
Swiss bank, with a branch in the Cayman Islands, alone earned $2.7 million in 
loan administration fees "during a period when virtually no loans were 
approved." Fees also were earned by E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. and Lehman Bros. 
Inc., both of which also were named in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is the first to be filed by an agency served by the California Health 
Facilities Financing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
In January, before the suit was filed, two Santa Cruz County supervisors wrote 
Hayes a letter complaining that "the chief beneficiaries of the bond issue seem 
to have been the financial institutions and law and accounting firms which 
acted with or for the (health facilities) authority." 
</P>
<P>
William M. Marticorena, a Costa Mesa attorney who is representing Santa Cruz 
and Stanislaus counties, said, "The state sold this program as a means to help 
counties provide health facilities at a low cost. Unfortunately, a whole lot of 
people made a whole lot of money -- everyone except the counties." 
</P>
<P>
Marticorena conceded that many of the causes of action listed in the suit 
occurred before Hayes became treasurer. But he said that for the last six 
months, Hayes' office has been heavily involved in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Burton, an assistant state treasurer who sits on the health facilities 
authority as a proxy for Hayes, called the suit "nonsense." She said all fees 
paid to banks, lawyers and consultants were strictly in line with industry 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said even though much of the action occurred before Hayes took office he 
should have stepped in and seen to it that the bond money went for health 
facilities. "This is another example of Hayes being asleep at the switch," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue marks the latest chapter in the bruising race between Brown and Hayes 
for the treasurer's job. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hayes cited a report by the California Commission on State 
Government Organization and Economy, known also as the Little Hoover 
Commission, sharply criticizing financial practices of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District during the six years Brown served on that board. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things that Hayes pointed to was a commission finding that the 
district had "mismanaged" $1.8 billion in taxpayer dollars during the decade of 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said she so far has been unable to obtain a copy of the report and would 
not comment until she did. "I will have a specific response after I've had a 
chance to look at it," she said.

SOVIET LAWMAKERS OK NEW BANKING SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: PROPOSED LAWS, MODELED ON THE WEST, WOULD STRIP THE STATE'S CONTROL 
OVER MONETARY POLICY.

<P>
Soviet lawmakers gave approval in principle Tuesday to a new Western-style 
banking system, breaking the decades-old state stranglehold on everything from 
money supply to family savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The new banking laws, expected to take effect by next year, would strip the 
government of its control over monetary policy and allot the national bank a 
role similar to that of the Federal Reserve System in the United States, with 
powers to issue money and set interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would shore up the myriad commercial banks just beginning 
to appear here now that communism is yielding to capitalism; no one talks, even 
theoretically, about old Marxist dreams of doing away with money altogether. 
</P>
<P>
With billions of extra rubles clogging the Soviet economy and many of the 
country's 15 constituent republics fighting to issue their own money, "the 
(national) bank should be central and it should be tough," said Victor V. 
Gerashchenko, the Soviet Union's current chief banker. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have one currency and one policy," he told reporters, although the 
new system also would give the republics' banks virtual independence on 
everything except currency and issuing money. 
</P>
<P>
Initial approval by the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, for the 
revamped banking system is the Soviet Union's latest lurching move away from 
central planning and toward a market-driven economy. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new banking system, Supreme Soviet spokesman Arkady A. Maslennikov 
said, "is the first practical step toward dismantling the 
command-administrative system," as the old economic system is known. 
</P>
<P>
Unable so far to forge a unified plan for radical economic reform, President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has begun bringing in changes piecemeal and, recently, by 
decree. He has ordered the latest compromise version of an overall reform 
program -- the eighth -- to be ready by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The parliament of the vast Russian Federation, under the leadership of the 
outspoken reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, voted Tuesday to introduce its own, more 
radical economic reform plan Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Russian Premier Ivan S. Silayev warned the Kremlin not to get in the program's 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"If our program is not adopted, we will need other measures, right up to 
extreme ones, to secure it," he said, without specifying what action his 
government might take. 
</P>
<P>
The rebellious Russian republic brought on a major clash with the Kremlin this 
summer when it asserted control over all its own banking institutions, 
including its gold reserves. Gorbachev declared the action illegal, and the 
Russian government backed down; Yeltsin and Gorbachev later met and agreed to 
prevent such crises in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko said bank officials are trying to prevent the state bank from 
becoming a political pawn in such struggles between the republics and Moscow 
and to make it an independent, stabilizing force. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to say, 'Nobody should give commands to the bank,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko said Gorbachev's next economic decree, which has been disclosed 
but not yet formally issued, will lower the official value of the ruble from 
about $1.60 to 50 cents in commercial transactions. The new exchange rate will 
apply primarily to the sales and purchases by Soviet firms engaged in foreign 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed banking laws, the new central bank also would license 
commercial banks, which now number more than 100, to engage in foreign-exchange 
deals, which until now had been the exclusive right of state banks. 
</P>
<P>
In its present form, the central bank, known as Gosudarstvenny Bank or Gosbank, 
controlled virtually every financial transaction in the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
It channeled all taxes to the government, parceled out government funds to 
recipients and oversaw savings accounts and loans. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also part of the government and subservient to the Council of 
Ministers. When government agencies overspent their budget, the bank was 
generally ordered to use its resources -- in effect, channeling savers' money 
-- to cover the deficits; when that was impossible, it issued more money. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the bank will only answer to the Supreme Soviet, and the Council 
of Ministers will no longer be able to subsidize government operations from the 
bank's funds. The strong representation of the 15 republics on its board will 
give the bank a new federal character as well.

FATAL NUCLEAR SUB ACCIDENT DISCLOSED

The captain and seven crew members of the Soviet Union's first nuclear-powered 
submarine died of radiation poisoning after one of its reactors overheated in a 
hushed-up 1961 accident, according to a Soviet scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Georgy Kuznetsov, an engineer with the Vernadsky Research Institute of the 
Soviet Academy of Sciences, said he was aboard the submarine when the accident 
happened in the northwest Atlantic on July 4, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"This accident could have caused an ecological disaster comparable to 
Chernobyl," he said, referring to the explosion at a Soviet nuclear power plant 
in 1986, which killed scores and exposed thousands more to dangerously high 
doses of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Kuznetsov disclosed details of the incident at a European Community seminar on 
nuclear accidents in Luxembourg last week. A text of his speech was made 
available Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the rupture of a pipe in the reactor control system caused the 
accident. The reactor automatically shut down but then caught fire. The fire 
was extinguished, but the reactor's cooling system failed. To prevent disaster, 
the crew rigged an emergency cooling system using the vessel's drinking water 
reserves, he said.

A state-owned auto plant rejected an order from the Russian Federation for 
armored limousines for Boris N. Yeltsin and Russian Premier Ivan S. Silayev, an 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ruslan Khasbulatov, vice president of the republic, told the parliament that 
the order for four limousines was rejected by the Gorky automotive works and 
the Soviet automobile industry minister because permission of the KGB security 
agency had not been granted for building the cars. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, the populist who is the effective president of the Russian republic as 
chairman of its parliament, previously rejected the idea of riding in a special 
limousine. However, the republic ordered the cars for him and Silayev after 
Yeltsin was injured in a traffic accident last month.

The Kuwaiti resistance, which for nearly two months carried out a campaign of 
ambushes, sniper attacks and harassment against Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait, has 
scaled back its activities in the face of violent retaliation against not only 
the resistance fighters but other Kuwaitis as well, according to sources close 
to the Kuwaiti government. 
</P>
<P>
"The resistance has largely died out because of the massive reprisals," said a 
source close to the freedom fighters, who range from former military officers 
and police officers to wealthy business leaders. They have claimed 
responsibility for the deaths of more than 200 Iraqi soldiers since Iraq's Aug. 
2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Kuwait's government in exile said the government is focusing on 
new tactics to combat the Iraqi presence, including two military and civil 
defense training centers to be established in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50% to 60% of the 20,000 personnel in Kuwait's armed services are 
in the process of being mobilized outside the country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance, which has peppered Kuwait city with the sound of machine-gun 
fire every night since the invasion, and awakened it in the morning with new 
posters of the exiled Kuwaiti emir plastered on telephone polls, could never 
have been expected to take on the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi troops 
occupying Kuwait, a senior Kuwaiti government official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to appreciate that an army of almost half a million, which is roughly 
the size of the Kuwaiti population . . . with the size of the resistance we 
have, it is impossible," Cabinet Minister Yahia al Sumait said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to be realistic about this. Kuwaitis never were trained for 
these kinds of things . . . and with the fact that the difference in ratio is 1 
to 10 or 15, we did not expect to have an effective resistance. But to be 
honest, it was so effective, the retaliation from the Iraqis was so harsh, so 
savage, it ended up we had to change our tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti guerrillas, who have called themselves the Sumoud, or "standing 
against," claimed responsiblity for at least one suicide car-bomb attack on an 
Iraqi position at a hospital in the suburb of Jabriyeh and for dozens of sniper 
attacks, firebombings of Iraqi patrol vehicles and armed attacks on Iraqi 
military emplacements. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraqi soldiers went through neighborhoods and marked the houses of 
foreigners with red paint, resistance fighters painted over the markings during 
the night and pulled down street signs to further confuse the Iraqis, according 
to reports from Kuwaiti refugees in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
They also gave portable short-wave radios to Iraqi soldiers and encouraged them 
to listen to news reports about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from the British 
Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti military officers said some Kuwaiti guerrillas bought tanks from 
disenchanted Iraqi soldiers and blew them up. Western diplomats said Kuwaiti 
doctors were reporting as many as 25 Iraqi injuries a night at the height of 
the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few weeks after the invasion, Kuwaiti government officials 
communicated with resistance fighters by means of cellular telephones in Saudi 
Arabia and Bahrain. But since the Iraqi government cut off the cellular 
communications, reports have been limited to Kuwaitis slipping in and out of 
Kuwait. In recent weeks, most refugee reports have been filled with terrifying 
tales of Iraqi reprisals against the resistance fighters and people suspected 
of supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops reportedly were demolishing the homes of suspected resistance 
members and terrorizing entire neighborhoods with house-to-house searches in 
areas where Iraqi soldiers had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
A refugee interviewed in the Saudi gulfside town of Dammam told of a woman 
whose son had been arrested as a suspected resistance fighter. She was advised 
that he would be released if she showed Iraqi authorities his gun. The boy had 
a gun that had never been used, the man said, and the woman showed it to Iraqi 
soldiers. They sent her son home -- shot through the head. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat in Saudi Arabia who has been monitoring events in Kuwait 
said five young suspected resistance fighters were shot on their doorsteps in 
front of their families. 
</P>
<P>
Some Kuwaitis said entire neighborhoods were combed and some houses destroyed 
by Iraqi soldiers after resistance activity was reported in the area. They said 
internal opposition to the resistance was growing as a result of the reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting this week with reporters in London, Kuwaiti Planning Minister Salman 
Abdul-Razek al Mutawa said the decision to cut back the resistance was made in 
response to the Iraqi policy of rounding up Kuwaiti nationals and destroying 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The resistance is now being toned down, really, to save the lives of innocent 
people," he said. "The resistance we are now talking about is passive 
resistance of the people." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, officials of Kuwait's government in exile in Taif say the resistance 
has largely accomplished what it set out to do: help mobilize world opinion 
behind Kuwait and demonstrate that Kuwait was prepared to do whatever it could 
to fight off the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"They've achieved a lot of what they needed to, to struggle and to make life 
difficult for the Iraqis, and to show the world that Kuwaitis were struggling 
and they did not sit back and expect the American boys to do it," a source 
close to the Kuwaiti government said. 
</P>
<P>
Sumait, the Cabinet minister, said: "There was a claim by the Iraqis that the 
invasion of Kuwait was invited, that someone asked them to come over and help 
save Kuwaitis from the Sabah regime. The principle behind all of this has been 
to deliver an answer to the claim of the Iraqis: What you are saying is not 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Defense Ministry has issued a circular in the past week encouraging 
exiled Kuwaiti men and women between the ages of 21 and 35 to report to the two 
new military training centers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to 
be prepared for outside military and civil defense service. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kuwait has now mobilized a full military brigade in Saudi Arabia and 
is preparing to complete mobilization of a second, a senior government official 
said. Most of the Kuwaiti servicemen have been equipped, government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this means that we are stopping the armed resistance (in Kuwait)," 
Sumait said. "We are changing our tactics." 
</P>
<P>
But now, he said, the emphasis will be on military action outside Kuwait.

HUSSEIN, PLO RADICAL WARN ISRAEL TO RETREAT

<TEXT>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Palestinian guerrilla chieftain Abul Abbas 
warned Israel on Tuesday that failure to withdraw from the occupied territories 
will invite eventual retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
In separate remarks on the killing Monday of 19 Palestinians in the Old City of 
Jerusalem, the two Arabs demanded international condemnation of the bloody 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, in a statement read by a studio announcer on Baghdad Radio, told the 
Israelis: "You have no choice but to leave the land of Palestine and Muslim 
shrines." He said Iraq has developed a long-range missile that would "serve 
like the stones of Palestinian youths." 
</P>
<P>
Several times in the last 10 months, Iraq has threatened to use missiles 
against Israel but only in response to an Israeli attack on Iraq with "weapons 
of mass destruction." In Tuesday's remarks he mentioned no such condition. 
</P>
<P>
"O Zionists," Hussein's statement said, "the heavier your weapons, the more 
arrogant you are and the more sins you commit." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, demonstrations protesting the killings were held at several 
sites around Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas, the guerrilla leader, spoke out at a news conference, saying he holds 
the United States and Israel equally responsible for what he termed a "vicious 
massacre." 
</P>
<P>
He called on Washington to refrain from using its Security Council veto to 
block any U.N. condemnation of the incident. If the world body fails to take 
action, he said, "our reaction will be very severe . . . against Israel in a 
direct way." 
</P>
<P>
The Security Council should require the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip and their replacement by an international peace force, 
Abbas said. This proposal has been put forth before by Palestinian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas, head of the maverick Palestine Liberation Front and a member of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization's ruling council, talked with reporters at 
PLF headquarters in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to past statements, his performance was relatively tempered and 
appeared to be aimed at creating divisions between European countries and the 
United States. He singled out France for praise of its Middle East policies. 
</P>
<P>
He linked the violence in Jerusalem to the Persian Gulf crisis and asserted 
that it was the first step in an Israeli plot to invade and occupy Jordan, 
where popular sentiment is strongly pro-Iraqi. 
</P>
<P>
A thickset, unsmiling man, Abbas was behind the 1985 hijacking of the Italian 
cruise ship Achille Lauro, in which an elderly American, Leon Klinghoffer, was 
shot and pushed overboard. Last May, Abbas' forces mounted an abortive raid on 
Israeli beaches. Washington and Jerusalem have branded him a terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
"Will the international community expect us to keep silent in the face of this 
massacre?" Abbas asked. "What will you say in the future if there is a reaction 
from our side? Will you say it's a terrorist action?" 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Palestinians have a "legitimate right to armed defense."

COURT TO RULE ON PASSENGER SEARCHES; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: THE CASE INVOLVING LUGGAGE ON BUSES AND TRAINS WILL TEST WHETHER 
CONSERVATIVES ARE READY TO INCREASE POLICE POWERS. SOUTER TAKES OATH. 
</P>

<P>
Shortly after swearing in David H. Souter as the ninth Supreme Court justice, 
the court announced that it would decide whether police may board buses and 
trains routinely to search for drugs in the bags of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The search and seizure case will test whether Souter and his conservative 
colleagues are ready to give the police new powers in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the court has required that police have some evidence or suspicion 
of wrong-doing before they stop a traveler and search his bags. The prevailing 
rule for decades had been that random, routine searches violate the 4th 
Amendment's ban on "unreasonable searches and seizures." 
</P>
<P>
But in the push to combat illegal drugs, that rule is being whittled away. Last 
year, the court upheld the search of travelers who fit a "drug courier profile" 
on the grounds that these general traits give the police some basis for picking 
out suspicious persons. In June, the court also ruled that motorists may be 
stopped briefly at sobriety checkpoints. If the drivers who are stopped look 
intoxicated, officers can pull them over for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the case (Florida vs. Bostick, 89-1717), prosecutors are asking the high 
court to go one step further. They contend that police should be allowed to 
"routinely, but randomly" board buses and trains, question the passengers, and 
search their bags even if there is no reason to believe that a particular 
passenger is carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Florida Supreme Court in a strongly worded opinion ruled such 
searches illegal. "Roving patrols, random sweeps and arbitrary searches and 
seizures would go far to eliminate such (drug) crimes in this state," the 
Florida court said. "Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia and Communist Cuba have 
demonstrated all too tellingly the effectiveness of such methods." 
</P>
<P>
The 4-3 decision threw out drug evidence obtained by officers who boarded buses 
and Amtrak trains at stopovers in Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach. State 
attorneys described the searches of passengers and their bags as voluntary, or 
"consensual encounters," between the police and the travelers. But the state 
court disagreed, saying that passengers had no choice but to submit to the 
searches. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors then appealed to the Supreme Court, noting that Florida "is a major 
pipeline for illegal drugs and thus a particularly critical area in the 
nation's . . . efforts to combat drug smuggling." In recent years, the high 
court has ruled regularly for prosecutors in drug cases and on Tuesday the 
justices announced that they would hear the state's appeal. A ruling can be 
expected early next year. 
</P>
<P>
For Souter, his first day began with the official oath required of federal 
judges. On Monday, Souter was at the White House where President Bush watched 
as he took the constitutional oath required of all federal employees. But Bush 
did not come for the court ceremony on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Standing alongside Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Souter promised to "do 
equal right to the poor and to the rich." He then shook hands with Justice 
Thurgood Marshall and moved down to his seat on the far right end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the court, Rehnquist told Souter: "I wish you a long and happy 
career in our common calling." 
</P>
<P>
With the new seating arrangement, the justices, starting from the left as seen 
from the courtroom are Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor, Harry A. 
Blackmun, Byron R. White, Rehnquist, Marshall, John Paul Stevens, Antonin 
Scalia and Souter. 
</P>
<P>
After the five-minute ceremony, the court recessed briefly for what is a 
once-in-a-career moment for a Supreme Court justice: an official "photo 
opportunity" in front of the court. Rehnquist and Souter took the traditional 
walk down the marble steps, where a smiling Souter posed for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the July day when President Bush introduced him to the nation -- a 
moment when Souter says he was "in a state of virtual shock" -- the new justice 
looked confident and at ease Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Hurry and load up," he joked with photographers. "I've got to go to work." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, court aides had mused that the bookish bachelor might rent a room in 
the Library of Congress next door. Not true, Souter said, telling reporters 
that he had signed a lease on a Washington apartment. 
</P>
<P>
After the photo session, he headed inside to hear four hours of oral arguments 
with the other justices. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actions Tuesday, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether the nation's private hospitals must recognize 
separate bargaining units for doctors, registered nurses, technical employees, 
maintenance workers, clerical employees and other professionals (AHA vs. NLRB, 
90-97). The American Hospital Assn. says that this array of bargaining groups 
-- mandated by the National Labor Relations Board -- is causing work stoppages 
and hurting patient care around the nation. The hospitals want to consolidate 
employees into three bargaining units. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether all Latinos can be excluded from a jury trying a 
Latino man for attempted murder (Hernandez vs. New York, 89-7645). The New York 
courts said that they can be excluded but the Supreme Court in 1986 ruled that 
all blacks could not be excluded from a jury trying a black defendant.

SQUABBLING BETWEEN HOUSE AND SENATE CLOUDS FUTURE OF CLEAN AIR LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The long legislative battle to enact a clean air bill this year is in danger of 
being lost as lawmakers and special interest groups clash over provisions 
mandating the production of cleaner-burning cars and fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, the first major revision of the nation's 
air pollution laws in 13 years, have been described by the congressional 
leadership of both parties as the most important, complex and far-reaching 
legislation to come before Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
But despite three months of often bitter bargaining, House and Senate conferees 
have made only meager progress toward reconciling the myriad technical 
differences contained in the House and Senate versions of the omnibus bill. 
Unless they resolve the remaining disputes this week, there may not be time to 
reconcile the bills and pass legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This week is heartbreak hill for the clean air debate," said an aide to one of 
the conferees, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"The clock is ticking away, and there has been very little progress," added 
Daniel Weiss, an environmentalist with the Sierra Club. He now rates the 
chances of passing clean air legislation this year at "no better than 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
The effort continues to be overshadowed by the current maneuvering over the 
federal budget. At the moment, clean air negotiations are bedeviled by 
differences over the development of a new generation of non-polluting "clean" 
motor vehicles and the fuels that will run them. Additionally, negotiators must 
work out disagreements about cleaner-burning "reformulated gasoline" for cars 
already on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate bills contain provisions to encourage the development 
of clean-fueled vehicles through stringent pollution limits on "fleet 
vehicles," such as taxicabs and delivery vans, in the nation's most polluted 
cities. They also establish a special pilot program for California, mandating 
the production and distribution of clean-burning cars and fuels. Both also call 
for the sale of specially blended reformulated gasoline in the nation's 
smoggiest cities beginning in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
But although the two bills take a broadly similar approach toward reducing 
automobile pollution, major differences lurk in the still unresolved details. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill, for instance, preempts states from regulating smog-causing 
emissions from "non-road vehicles" such as farm and construction equipment. The 
Senate wants that stricture removed -- as do California air quality officials. 
They argue that non-road engines account for about 10% of the state's 
smog-causing emissions from motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Proving even more intractable is the stalemate over a proposal not in either 
version of the bill. Introduced by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) on behalf of auto industry interests, the proposal 
would make the Environmental Protection Agency responsible for enforcing the 
California standards for clean vehicles in other states that choose to adopt 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the EPA would not act, environmentalists and states such as New 
York, which has already decided to adopt the California standards, want to 
retain the authority to enforce the program themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They're locked into a debate over things that are not even in either bill. 
Industry advocates, led by Dingell, have succeeded in redefining the choices 
and reshaping the terms of the debate in their favor," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, differences have been widened, rather than narrowed, and 
compromises have been concocted that are so complicated that several conferees 
complained last week that they no longer even understand what it is they're 
arguing about. 
</P>
<P>
"Dingell and his allies are trying to weaken the bill through a strategy of 
delay that will force the conferees to choose between a bad bill or no bill," 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
"Waxman is doing his best to fight for strong legislation, but he doesn't have 
the votes on the House side," he added. "And the preoccupation with the budget 
is keeping the House leadership from stepping in and saving the day." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some conferees are becoming so disillusioned with the process 
that they are threatening to walk out of the conference and begin the process 
all over again next year if no progress is made this week. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), who warned last week that he would 
not be maneuvered by "a strategy of delay" into accepting a weak bill on 
grounds that it would be better than no bill at all.

Water service to 400,000 residents of south and east San Diego County was 
restored to normal Tuesday after 11 days of severe restrictions prompted by the 
rupture of a major water pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary restrictions on outdoor watering were continued Tuesday evening and 
early today to avoid a large drop in water pressure in the new pipeline, which 
carries 140 million gallons a day to the Padre Dam, Helix, Riverview, Lakeside 
and Otay water districts. 
</P>
<P>
The Stage 4 alert, the county's first, reverted to a Stage 2 level, which was 
adopted in May by the San Diego County Water Authority in an effort to reduce 
the county's water usage by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the five affected water districts responded to conservation 
requests by reducing water usage by up to two-thirds in some areas and at least 
half in the remaining areas.

FLASHBACK RELIVING MOMENTS IN L.A. COUNTY HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
1917: THE MARCH TO WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The record of Los Angeles' participation in the great war . . . is a proud and 
inspiring one. It is the record of the achievement of our part of a people who, 
until war burst upon them, were utterly without organization for war, but who 
succeeded rapidly and efficiently to become a powerful and purposeful 
instrument for help in its prosecution. -- Los Angeles Times, Nov. 24, 1918 
</P>
<P>
It was a time before war lost its romance, when the call to arms was still 
heard as a summons to great adventure. The first months of 1917 left few 
believing that America could stay out of the conflict raging in Europe for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
European political and economic rivalries had festered for decades, needing 
only a suitable saber to lance the boil. The sword turned out to be the 
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, 
in Serbia in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia, in turn, mobilized against Austria, 
prompting Germany to declare war on the Czar's empire. France's mobilization 
resulted in Germany declaring war on her as well. When Germany moved against 
France, England then declared war. Soon, all of Europe was aflame, and the "war 
to end all wars" was on. 
</P>
<P>
On April 2, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to declare war, convinced 
that the United States must must make the world "safe for democracy." Four days 
later, Congress approved the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers boasted of the hometown drive to contribute to the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Beginning in April, 1917, our industry was mobilized and our products in vast 
quantities delivered to the government for military and naval uses," The Times 
article continued. "Common endeavor in a common cause has brought mutual 
understanding; the social effect of the self-denial we have practiced will be 
enduring and Los Angeles emerges from its task strengthened, united and better 
equipped for the great future which awaits it." 
</P>
<P>
By June, 1917 -- two months after the U.S. had entered World War I -- about 
42,000 of Los Angeles County's 1 million residents had registered to serve in 
the armed forces. Just over half went off to combat, part of the nearly 162,000 
troops from California who fought in the Great War. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 Californians -- 185 from Los Angeles -- would not return. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict had a dramatic impact on the area's economy. Defense industries 
felt the swell of the demand for the instruments of war. In one case, the 
Southwestern Shipbuilding Co. at Terminal Island had a wartime contract to 
build 23 8,000-ton ships -- in just 77 days. Employment in the shipyards soared 
to more than 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions from Los Angeles County to the war effort ran across the 
spectrum: 1,600 engineers, 392 Red Cross nurses and 235 Medical Corpsmen had 
their roots in the county. Angelenos -- inspired by posters urging Americans to 
"Beat back the Hun with Liberty Bonds -- bought $140,257,000 in Liberty Loans 
and War Stamps, donated $500,000 worth of relief clothing and food, and paid 
$7,000,000 in war-related taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Seven million pounds of sugar -- worth $657,000 -- were sent to the front. And 
28,758,408 gallons of oil from Los Angeles County refineries fueled the 
machines of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Though most World War I veterans have died, there are still thousands living in 
California. An estimated 2,400 veterans of World War I are alive and living in 
the county today.

KINGS TURN GAME UP AGAIN, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

VANCOUVER, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the Kings, it's early. 
</P>
<P>
It's also confusing. 
</P>
<P>
With the season three games old, there doesn't yet seem to be any way to tell 
which team is going to show up to put on those silver and black uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
There are the confident, tough, defensive-minded Kings who beat the Vancouver 
Canucks Tuesday night, 6-2, after similarly shutting down the New York 
Islanders, 4-1, in their season opener. 
</P>
<P>
But there are also the overconfident, defensively inept Kings that got blasted 
out of the Forum several nights earlier by these same Canucks after loafing 
through a practice session the day before as though they already had won the 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Can a team suffer from a split personality? 
</P>
<P>
The Kings certainly figured to suffer Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks figured to be sky high, coming off a big win to play their home 
opener at Pacific Coliseum before a sellout crowd of 16,123. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, on the other hand, figured to be hitting rock bottom. Most of their 
defensive line was back home. Marty McSorley has a twisted knee, Tim Watters 
bruised ribs, Tom Laidlaw a bad back, Bob Halkidis the aftereffects of shoulder 
surgery and Brian Benning one final game left on his suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Their goalie, Kelly Hrudey, was on the bench, getting his first rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
That left backup Daniel Berthiaume in the net and newcomers such as Dennis 
Smith, Rod Buskas and Rene Chapdelaine on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Kings could have been down emotionally after enduring a verbal 
attack from their coach, Tom Webster, following their dismal practice last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it figured to be another tough night Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
So go figure. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings put together a strong, balanced all-around game, getting two goals in 
the first period, four in the second and an impressive defensive effort 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
They spread the scoring around with Luc Robitaille, Brad Jones, Bob Kudelski, 
Todd Elik, Rob Blake and Jay Miller each getting one. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille's goal was his team-leading third of the season. His assist on 
Elik's goal was his 400th NHL point. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the Kings held the Canucks to just one shot on goal through nearly 
the first 16 minutes of the game and only two shots through 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver helped out by blowing several scoring opportunities, one on a 
four-on-one rush when Petr Nedved missed a five-foot shot on an open net. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks should have known it wasn't going to be their night when their 
goalie, Kirk McLean, was slammed to the ice, stunned, after being cracked in 
the head with a stick inadvertently by one of his own men, Garth Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks drop to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 2-1, but now must go home to face the Edmonton Oilers on 
Thursday, the Boston Bruins on Saturday and the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is, who will be there to face them, the Kings of Tuesday or 
the Kings of doomsday? 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
King With a Large Empire: Owner Bruce McNall was in Paris Sunday, watching 
Saumarez, the horse he owns with Wayne Gretzky, win the $1-million Prix de 
l'Arc de Triomphe. He was home in Los Angeles Monday for a coin show. And on to 
Vancouver Tuesday for the Kings game. Now you know why he bought his own plane. 
. . . Before the game, the Canucks announced the release of defenseman Bob 
Dollas. A member of the Canadian National team last year, Dollas had yet to 
appear on the ice for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks appeared to have wasted a pick in the waiver draft last week when 
they selected veteran defenseman Randy Gregg from the Edmonton Oilers. Gregg 
subsequently retired. But the Canucks are still hoping he will change his mind. 
. . . Darcy Rota, the first former player to serve as a director of media 
relations in the NHL, is leaving the Canucks after 3 1/2 seasons to serve as a 
special assistant to John Ziegler. His place will be taken by Steve Tambellini, 
another former player.

Allan Bristow, an executive for the Charlotte Hornets, has apologized for 
grabbing and pushing the agent for first-round draft pick Kendall Gill during 
negotiations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bristow offered to pay medical expenses resulting from the incident involving 
agent Arn Tellem, the NBA said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were negotiating hard on behalf of our clients and I guess I got carried 
away," Bristow said. "Arn conducted himself professionally at all times, and I 
know that I was wrong and I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Tellem said Bristow's statement "closes the incident." 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get back to business as usual and make sure Gill is signed as 
soon as possible," the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
The league did not say if Tellem was injured during the incident in Charlotte, 
but earlier reports said he suffered a sprained neck. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern said no action would be taken against Bristow.

International track and field's full doping commission will study drug tests of 
shotput world record-holder Randy Barnes in what an official described as "an 
added step" in the testing process. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes was tested last summer after a meet at Malmo, Sweden. His urine specimen 
was divided into two samples. A French sports newspaper reported that the first 
part of the sample had shown positive results for an undisclosed banned 
substance. Under IAAF rules, an athlete is not considered to have tested 
positive unless both parts of the sample fail.

NEWSWIRE: MIAMI EXPECTED TO JOIN THE BIG EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Miami, seeking basketball credibility to go with its football 
reputation, is considered likely to accept an invitation to join the Big East 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The school's board of trustees will decide the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe accepting an invitation to the Big East would be very much in 
order," board member David Kraslow said. "I favor it very strongly for a whole 
variety of reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Joining the high-profile conference could mean the salvation of a basketball 
program that has averaged fewer than 3,000 fans a game since Miami resumed 
playing the sport in 1985 after a 15-year hiatus. Also, income from basketball, 
along with conference revenue sharing, would reduce financial pressure on the 
football program.

MORNING BRIEFING: TO DRAW MORE, SIMPLY VISIT THE DEEP WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offhand, which would you say were the two worst baseball cities in the National 
League in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
If you rate the teams according to attendance by market size, as the Pittsburgh 
Press did recently, the answer is New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who outdrew every other National League team in gross attendance 
with 2,925,853, ranked 11th in attendance by market size, with 21,248 per 
100,000. And the Mets, second in gross attendance with 2,617,300, occupied the 
deep cellar with 14,444 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Add attendance: The newspaper's chart showed the Pirates third, with 80,950 per 
100,000, behind Cincinnati, with 126,954, and St. Louis, with 101,042. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball fever? Greater Pittsburgh hasn't necessarily caught it. The Pirates 
drew only 45,611 for Game 3 of the National League playoffs Monday and 50,461 
for Game 4 Tuesday. Capacity for baseball at Three Rivers Stadium is 58,729. 
</P>
<P>
Last add attendance: Pirate General Manager Larry Doughty did his part before 
Monday's game. Walking outside the stadium, he saw a young man waiting by one 
of the gates. 
</P>
<P>
Doughty asked him what he was waiting for. The man said he was hoping to get in 
but couldn't afford a ticket. Doughty handed him a ticket for a third-base box 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the only major league game in which every player on one 
team finished with the same batting average he had when the game began? 
</P>
<P>
Bad news, so-so news: For Fresno State, what good could possibly come from its 
73-18 mauling at the hands of Northern Illinois Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Bulldogs can take solace in a statistic. By surrendering only 73 
yards passing, they moved from 11th place to a tie for ninth in the NCAA 
Division I-A pass defense ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Northern Illinois offense attempted only six passes, completed 
four and spent most of its time running the ball for 733 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Throw in the towel: Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser, on the 
harassment of Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson in the New England Patriots' 
locker room: "Keep Olson out and you discriminate. You break the law. 
</P>
<P>
"And the commissioners of all the major sports won't let that happen -- because 
they're all lawyers. They know women will take them to court and beat the pants 
off them." 
</P>
<P>
Now it can be told: The Chicago Cubs defeated Philadelphia, 4-3, last 
Wednesday, the final day of the season, to tie the Phillies for fourth place in 
the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the credit went to the Cubs' manager . . . Andre Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Don Zimmer said he let his right fielder make all the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson, sitting at the manager's desk in the clubhouse, said: "I was kidding 
around before the game, saying I was going to manage. Zim said, 'Go ahead and 
manage.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Dawson: Said Zimmer: "All I told him was I wanted (Greg) Maddux to win his 
15th." 
</P>
<P>
Before Dawson pulled him after eight innings, Maddux (15-15) gave up seven hits 
and had a season-high nine strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Maddux: "I didn't mind coming out after the eighth inning. I was tired and 
struggled the final three innings. It would have been silly to stay in." 
</P>
<P>
As any fourth-place manager could tell you. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bob Feller's opening-day no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox 
at Comiskey Park in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Joe Sroba, agent for San Francisco outfielder Kevin Mitchell, after 
Mitchell signed a four-year, $15-million contract extension: "This deal 
indicates that major league baseball is healthy, Kevin Mitchell is wealthy and 
the Giants are wise." TED BROCK

A'S ECKERSLEY PREVAILS AGAINST EVANS ONCE AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
It was not, Dennis Eckersley said with the hint of a smile Tuesday, a pointed 
effort to show up Dwight Evans. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Evans said the Oakland Athletics' relief ace was doing Sunday 
night when he exultantly pumped his right arm after striking out the Boston Red 
Sox's designated hitter on three pitches with two out and two on in the eighth 
inning of American League playoff Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
These two former teammates met again in the ninth inning of Game 3, and Evans 
struck out again as the leadoff hitter, unable to check his swing on a high 
fastball with the count full. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley reacted by pointing the index finger of his right hand toward the 
plate. A television close-up of Evans as he walked away showed him saying, " . 
. . you." 
</P>
<P>
At his locker later, Eckersley said he couldn't help but think of the events of 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't want to make him mad, and I didn't want to walk him, either," 
Eckersley said. "He swung at a ball out of the strike zone, and I pointed at 
the checked swing. I meant no offense to him, believe me. Of course, I'm having 
more fun than Dewey because I keep striking him out." 
</P>
<P>
Evans attempted to out-wait reporters in the Boston clubhouse later, having an 
attendant bring his clothes into the trainer's room, but he finally emerged and 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"Again, I have great admiration for him. Naturally, in that situation I wanted 
a piece of him, but there's nothing going on between us. Really, I just don't 
want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley has 10 saves for his postseason career, a record. His second of this 
series broke a tie with Rollie Fingers. Eckersley has appeared in all 11 of the 
A's victories in the last three playoffs and has allowed only one earned run in 
15 playoff innings. 
</P>
<P>
Before being caught trying to steal third base in the seventh inning Tuesday, 
Rickey Henderson was 14 for 14 on the bases in postseason play. Henderson has 
11 playoff steals and three in the World Series. He also has an 11-game 
postseason hitting streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad in a way about losing my (stealing) streak," Henderson said. "It meant 
a lot. I shouldn't really have been running then." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart, today's Oakland starter, is 9-0 in his last 10 starts against 
Boston since Aug. 19, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With a 4-0 playoff record, he's tied with six other pitchers for the most 
victories in playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco will skip batting practice today to spare his right hand further 
injury. He has been bothered by a jammed middle finger on his right hand, which 
has caused pain that radiates back into his palm.

GRIFFEY HAS MORE THAN ROOTING INTEREST IN REDS

It would be easy, Ken Griffey Sr. says, for him to be bitter. It would be easy 
for him to use the National League championship series as a podium to express 
anger at being released by the Cincinnati Reds in August. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Griffey is smiling in front of the cameras, visiting his former 
teammates in the clubhouse and at the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds still consider him one of their own. Most of the players have even 
inscribed the No. 30 on the back of their caps, in recognition of Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey was released by the Reds on Aug. 17 after 10 years in the organization 
when a roster spot was needed for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella came up with the idea of placing Griffey on the disabled 
list for 15 days, and by the time he was eligible to play, the rosters would be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey refused and was released, although the Reds chose to call it a 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He became the Seattle Mariners' left fielder, playing alongside his son, Ken 
Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Griffey has a vested interest in the Reds. He was voted a full playoff 
share by his ex-teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Reds' owner Marge Schott had an embarrassing moment Tuesday night when she 
walked through the gate at Three Rivers Stadium, was stopped and a bottle of 
beer was confiscated from her purse. The locally-brewed beer apparently had 
been given to her, along with other souvenirs, by a Pittsburgh television 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble's topic of the day was hockey. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' reliever, who left the clubhouse after Game 3 Monday wearing a 
Pittsburgh Penguins jersey, played hockey while growing up in Bridgeport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was a "goon," but that did not stop the Chicago Black Hawks from 
offering him a tryout last summer during the All-Star break. "It was tempting 
to become sort of like a Bo Jackson," said Dibble, who is 6 feet 4 and 235 
pounds. "But I don't want to spend a couple of years playing minor league 
hockey and getting my head beat in." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got good news and bad news on the free-agent front Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Strawberry, appearing on CBS' pregame show, repeated earlier statements 
that the Dodgers are his first choice among potential employers. He added that 
if the offers from the Dodgers and Mets were similar, he likely would play in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Met outfielder will declare free agency after the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Browning, today's starting pitcher for the Reds, said that even though he 
could be a free agent this winter, he wants to stay with Cincinnati. A 
left-hander, he had been coveted by the Dodgers, against whom he pitched a 
perfect game in 1988.

Freshman Drew Bledsoe has replaced senior Brad Gossen as Washington State's 
starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe, one of the nation's top prep recruits last year, earned the starting 
job for his performance in a 30-17 loss to USC, Coach Mike Price said from 
Pullman, Wash., in a weekly telephone conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're going to do offensively in our game plan and what we want 
to do . . . is more the things that Drew Bledsoe does best," Price said. "We're 
going to try him out at it." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off the bench late against USC, Bledsoe threw for one touchdown and ran 
for another, completing six of 12 passes for 145 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Price said Bledsoe lacks experience, but knows the offense well enough to win.

Quarterback Tommy Maddox threw three interceptions when UCLA lost to Arizona, 
28-21, Saturday at the Rose Bowl. However, he earned the respect of an opponent 
and a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona free safety Jeff Hammerschmidt, who intercepted one of Maddox's passes, 
said the Bruin quarterback is the best his team has faced this year. "He's such 
a leader," Hammerschmidt said. "I don't know how many times he came up to the 
line, saw our defense and checked off to another play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's incredible, and the team really believes in him. He's just a big winner, 
and I can see why people love him over (in Los Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA wide receiver Reggie Moore said last year's team didn't always believe it 
could win. "This was a hard loss for us," Moore said. "We thought all along we 
were going to win it. But we're not going to fold. This team isn't going to 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Maddox is a major reason for UCLA's new attitude. "Tommy has 
tremendous poise," he said. MAL FLORENCE

<P>
Southland bass fishermen have been finding their quarry to be more than 
cooperative at Puddingstone Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Butch Ham of Chino spent one day catching -- and releasing -- 52 bass weighing 
up to six pounds. 
</P>

IT'S NOT ALL PLEASANT THERE; 
</P>
<P>
FISHING FOR WILD TROUT EXCELLENT IN OWENS RIVER, BUT FISHERY'S MANAGEMENT IS A 
QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trout season ends in the Eastern Sierra at the end of this month, except for 
the lower Owens River south of Crowley Lake through Pleasant Valley and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
The name Pleasant Valley sounds as if it's the setting for a family television 
series. Parts of "True Grit" -- John Wayne's 1969 Oscar effort -- were filmed 
there, where the river snakes lazily through grassland. 
</P>
<P>
There is no development -- not even a farmhouse -- because the land, like most 
of the Owens Valley, belongs to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
There are few trees for shade, but at 4,500-feet elevation the sun is welcome 
in the winter months when fishing continues. 
</P>
<P>
However, when the tourists go home, trouble remains in Pleasant Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The first five miles of the river -- eight or 10 if you track its meanderings 
-- are designated a wild trout fishery, meaning that all of the fish are native 
German browns -- no hatchery wimps here. 
</P>
<P>
Hatchery fish are "all too damn much the same size," Ray Milovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Milovich and fishing pal Dan Young are lifelong residents of Bishop. They don't 
have much use for hatchery fish. John Wayne probably didn't, either. Pleasant 
Valley doesn't need them. Locals will match their river against any of the 
premier fly streams in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"I fished the Madison this summer," Lou Franke said. "Not a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Milovich said: "Dan and I have 60 years fishing this thing. You can catch more 
fish here in 10 minutes, even the way it is, than you can out of the Madison." 
</P>
<P>
With only native trout and a two-fish limit -- below the standard five-fish 
limit for the state -- bait and barbed hooks are still permitted. The 
combination of conditions doesn't make any sense, Milovich and other locals 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Under the state Department of Fish and Game's wild trout program, a 
full-fledged wild trout stream, such as Hot Creek a few miles up the road, 
allows only artificial flies or lures and single, barbless hooks. Fish may 
easily be released to observe the zero limit. 
</P>
<P>
That's how Milovich and his cronies would like to see Pleasant Valley managed. 
</P>
<P>
Fish tend to swallow baited hooks, and if they're barbed, an angler often must 
decide between killing the fish or snipping off his leader. For a good 
fisherman, that can mean a short day fishing in Pleasant Valley, if he obeys 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Milovich said, "Ninety percent of the fishermen don't know how to 
catch (native) fish. The German brown is not a salmon egger. If you know what 
you're doing with a worm or a fly or some of these lures, you can catch them." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some of the wily local fishermen who work Pleasant Valley in the 
winter know how to catch them an easier way: crickets. "These guys get in here 
with crickets and just murder them," Franke said. 
</P>
<P>
Franke said he was fly-fishing one day, watching a fishermen using crickets for 
bait on the other side of the river. "He cast in five times in the same hole 
and pulled out five fish -- nothing less than 14 inches. And these guys keep 
them. They're meat fishermen." 
</P>
<P>
Young said: "They throw them in their freezer until next spring, when they 
clean out their freezer (and throw them away)." 
</P>
<P>
The limit, he said, is meaningless, adding: "People know there aren't too many 
wardens around." 
</P>
<P>
Franke, Milovich and Young also would like to see Pleasant Valley closed for a 
month or two each year, especially during the spawning period in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game thinks Pleasant Valley is doing fine as it is. 
Darrell Wong, a DFG fishery biologist based in Bishop, has a personal as well 
as a professional interest. He fishes Pleasant Valley often. 
</P>
<P>
Wong said: "The wild trout concept doesn't really lock one into barbless 
(artificial) lures, and unless we have evidence to show why the majority of the 
public should be excluded from fishing for wild trout, we don't feel we would 
be able to justify it. We haven't been able to demonstrate that bait angling 
has decimated the population. Brown trout are very difficult to catch." 
</P>
<P>
John Deinstadt, head of the DFG's wild trout program, said: "The catch rate is 
as good as it's ever been . . . one fish every two hours." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the evidence is that trout don't readily swallow crickets. "The majority 
of fish are hooked in the lip area (and easily released)," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any reason to close the river during spawning, Wong said. Many of 
the fish heading upstream at nature's call are diverted into a spawning channel 
that is off-limits to anglers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with taking spawners, as long as there's enough fish 
coming into the population to keep it healthy," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Other locals agree that the rules are fine in Pleasant Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They have adequate regulations," Noel Kobayashi said. "They just need to be 
enforced. A lot of locals will go out there and take a dozen fish." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Rowe of Sierra Bright Dot in Mammoth Lakes is a dedicated fly-fisherman, 
but he said: "One of the things I like (about Pleasant Valley) is that they do 
allow bait fishing. It's OK to bait fish, but we've got to get the 
non-fly-fishermen into catch-and-release (fishing)." 
</P>
<P>
That's where most serious fishermen -- fly and bait -- agree. 
</P>
<P>
Milovich said the fish aren't worth eating most of the time, anyway. "For the 
first two months of the season, they're edible," he said. "After that, they 
take on that grassy taste from Crowley Lake (when) the water starts getting 
that green junk in it -- an algae condition. It's the same water that comes 
down here. It's a bum taste. You can't even smoke them and get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
Deinstadt said the mean size of the fish has dropped recently from 12 inches to 
10 or 11 inches, perhaps attributable to lower water flows during the current 
four-year drought. But the DFG doesn't want to adjust regulations to address a 
temporary condition. It's better, Deinstadt said, to wait until two or three 
years after the drought ends and conditions settle down to normal, then look at 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Tightening regulations, he said, would shift Pleasant Valley's emphasis toward 
the elite fisherman, and from the beginning, he added, "We wanted the wild 
trout program not to be exclusively for the fly angler." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps what bothers Milovich, Franke and Young the most is that Pleasant 
Valley isn't the way it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
They are appalled to see visitors camped hard against the cut banks of the 
river, just upstream from the DWP's pristine day-use area. 
</P>
<P>
"These people spook the heck out of the fish . . . put them down for hours," 
Milovich said. "You see them washing their clothes in the river, with liquid 
soap . . . taking a bath." 
</P>
<P>
When the water flows are high enough, they see people floating by in inner 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
They miss the days of fishing the spectacular Owens River Gorge upstream 
between Crowley and Pleasant Valley Reservoir, before the DWP's diversion 
tunnel took most of the flow in the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Milovich recalled: "The gorge, you had to want to go fishing if you went there. 
And fish -- the sizes of them you wouldn't believe. A friend of mine got a 
26-pound brown. My dad got a 17 3/4, a 15, a 14 1/2. Didn't even consider 
fishing in the five-pound class. It was ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers tell tales of being dragged down the gorge by monster fish, through 
brush and over rocks, at risk of tumbling into the violent rush of water. The 
gorge is still fishable in places, where seepage allows flows of up to 18 cubic 
feet per second. 
</P>
<P>
"It contains a tremendous population of brown trout, (but) it's extremely 
difficult fishing," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
The river's flow through Pleasant Valley is more placid, varying from the 
present 125 to 750 cubic feet per second during high releases from the Pleasant 
Valley Dam. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape is unchanged from when Milovich and Young fished here with their 
fathers in the '30s, using rods and flies imported from England. "This is where 
they fished," Milovich said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, probably, is that it's not 1930 anymore.

HARNESS HALL OF FAME IS ONE OF FEW PLACES THAT JIM DENNIS, 67, HASN'T MADE HIS 
MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the better harness racing books is Marie Hill's "Single G: The Horse 
That Time Forgot," the biography of a star pacer who won 262 of his 434 races 
from 1913 to 1926. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Jim Dennis must feel like the driver that harness racing forgot. One 
of the leading horsemen in the sport for most of his life, Dennis has been 
overlooked for the Harness Hall of Fame in Goshen, N.Y. There have been 48 
members inducted since its inception in 1961, 27 of them trainer-drivers and 
few more deserving than Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, 67, is semi-retired and lives in Solana Beach, just off the second 
fairway of Lomas Santa Fe Golf Club and two miles from the Del Mar race track. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis tried to downplay the oversight during a visit to the thoroughbred races 
at Del Mar last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I never played politics," he said. "I'm in the Hall of Fame in California and 
Illinois." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis' record should earn a spot in any Hall of Fame. He drove 2,677 winners 
and developed such stars as Sir Dalrae, 1973 horse of the year; Mr. Dalrae, 
1984 aged pacing champion, and mid-'60s pacing star Adios Vic. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir Dalrae was the best," Dennis said. "He was like a machine. Track 
conditions, posts didn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
Sir Dalrae won 20 of 27 starts in 1973 against top free-for-all competition 
around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Dalrae earned $1,150,807 and recorded a best time of 1:52 2/5 at the 
Meadowlands. Both the Dalrae horses were owned by the A La Carte stable of Bill 
Smith, owner of the Dalrae Restaurant in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Adios Vic is best remembered as the nemesis of Bret Hanover, a three-time horse 
of the year who won 62 of 68 races. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat him a total of five times," Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
Bret Hanover was unbeaten in 24 starts as a 2-year-old and had won his first 35 
races when he met Adios Vic at Springfield, Ill., in August of his 3-year-old 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could beat Bret Hanover but I never told anybody because they would 
say I was crazy," Dennis said. "Adios Vic was the fastest horse I ever trained 
or drove. He could race a quarter in :26 in those days, and that was fantastic. 
Sometimes he had so much speed he couldn't handle it. After he beat Bret in 
Springfield, he beat him again two weeks later in Indianapolis." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis also recalled winning a race at Santa Anita in 1:57 2/5 with a 
13-year-old from New Zealand named Caduceus. Another victory that gave him 
great satisfaction was the 1967 American Trotting Championship at Yonkers, 
N.Y., with Perfect Freight. 
</P>
<P>
"The great mare Roquepine was in that race and I never thought I had a chance," 
Dennis said. "I remember sitting on the plane, trying to figure how I was just 
going to get a check out of the race. In the race, I was sitting in a perfect 
position, Roquepine broke and jammed up the horses behind her, and I won by 
five." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis quit driving about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured a guy of my age had no business competing with the kids," he said. 
"I didn't feel I was competitive at that age. 
</P>
<P>
"My business nowadays is to develop young horses and send them to trainers." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer he turned over two 2-year-old colt pacers and a 3-year-old filly 
pacer to Tom Harmer in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Dennis still knows his business: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mr. Gourmet, a son of Mr. Dalrae, won at Lexington, Ky., Friday in 1:54, a 
world record for a 2-year-old gelding pacer on a mile track. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Royal Salute, another 2-year-old colt, won in 1:59 3/5 at Sportsman's Park 
in Chicago, despite a throat problem most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tip 'n Tax, the sophomore filly, has earned $123,000 and won in 1:53 at Du 
Quoin, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis is eager to get started with three yearlings he bought for Smith at the 
recent Tattersalls Sale at Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a trotter for $35,000 and two pacing fillies, including the half 
sister to Tip 'n Tax for $45,000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been training for Bill for 30 years, and I trained for 35 for Victor and 
Morris Zeinfeld of Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis grew up in Idaho, the son of a trainer-driver in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
"We raced in Idaho, Utah and Oregon," he said. "I remember coming to Pomona for 
the Los Angeles County Fair in the early 1940s." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis has lived in the Del Mar area since 1950, in large part because of 
access to the state-owned Del Mar track for winter training. He is hopeful that 
he can start developing some more future stars at Del Mar soon. 
</P>
<P>
"With the CHRB turning down Pomona dates this winter, there's no place else for 
harness people to go but Del Mar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harness Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos, remains angry over 
the California Horse Racing Board's denial of Los Alamitos-leased harness dates 
at Fairplex Park in Pomona from Oct. 26 to Jan. 12. Arnold considered the meet 
a vital link to a year-round harness circuit in California. Los Alamitos is 
taking the CHRB to court in Sacramento today in an attempt to change the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in limbo," Arnold said. "I didn't know the board gave stabling precedent 
over live racing. If we don't get Pomona, I've petitioned the board to let us 
go to less than a five-day week for our remaining two weeks. We'll be losing a 
lot of horses to other tracks around the country, and if we can't fill the 
cards with the quality we're used to, I want to leave with integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos' $750,000 grandstand paddock will open next Tuesday with 
ribbon-cutting ceremonies at 7:15 p.m. With 25 permanent stalls and five 
portables, the facility will be able to hold horses for three races at one 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Broughten, an owner and breeder from Corona Del Mar with a penchant for 
clever names, bred both Nothing Ventured and Capital Game, trotting stars of 
the current meet. Broughten owns the mare, Initial Investment, and bred her to 
Diamond Exchange to produce Nothing Ventured, a 4-year-old colt, and to Camp 
David to produce Capital Game, a 3-year-old colt. Nothing Ventured, winner of 
more than $80,000, seeks his 11th straight victory in the $20,000 feature next 
Tuesday. Capital Game, who has earned more than $100,000, will race in the 
$38,612 Electioner Futurity Thursday.

"I bought Initial Investment at a sale in the East from Loren Evans, a famous

Owner Michael Schwartz of Santa Ana, who bought 3-year-old filly pacing 
sensation Lepton for $4,500 at a Pomona yearling sale, just purchased her full 
sister, Split Second, for $20,000 at an Illinois-bred yearling sale at Maywood 
Park in Chicago. Ross Croghan, Schwartz's driver, also was busy at the 
Tattersalls yearling sale at Lexington, buying a Nihilator filly named 
Animation, a Troublemaker filly named Whimsically and an Abercrombie colt named 
Shiney Key.

T K's Skipper, who set a world record of 1:51 in winning the $150,000 American 
Pacing Classic at Los Alamitos Set. 29, went to the well once too often. Five 
hours after the race, he was driven to Ontario Airport and flown directly to 
Lexington, Ky., where he competed three days later. He finished fifth as the 
2-5 favorite. . . . Dare You To, the American Pacing Classic runner-up trained 
by David Bittle for owner Joseph Alflen of Redondo Beach, was flown to New 
Jersey this week for a race at Garden State before a rematch with T K's Skipper 
in the Breeders' Crown Nov. 2 at Pompano Park, Fla.

Cool Charm Girl, a 7-year-old mare from New Zealand, shaved a tick off her 
week-old track record for aged pacing mares Friday, scoring easily in 1:54 4/5

driver standings with 46 victories, Paul Blumenfeld the trainers with 22.

10 SPRINTERS NAMED FOR ANCIENT TITLE 
</P>

<P>
With Housebuster injured, the Breeders' Cup Sprint has gone from a race with an 
odds-on favorite to a scramble, and a contender might emerge today from the 
$100,000 Ancient Title Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The Ancient Title, which is at six furlongs, drew 10 starters. 
</P>
<P>
The favorites are Prospectors Gamble and Sensational Star. 
</P>
<P>
Prospectors Gamble, who won two of three stakes earlier this year at Hollywood 
Park, has returned to California from Saratoga, where the 5-year-old roan had a 
victory and a fourth-place finish in two tries. 
</P>
<P>
Sensational Star, a former claimer, has increased his earnings to $365,355 with 
three consecutive victories, the last two in sprints at Del Mar. He barely 
missed the track record for three-quarters of a mile with a time of 1:08 in the 
Bing Crosby Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at Santa Anita, Ruhlmann and Lively One will try to earn their way 
to the Breeders' Cup for trainer Charlie Whittingham when they run in the 
$200,000 Goodwood Handicap, and on Sunday, older fillies and mares will compete 
on the grass in the $150,000 Las Palmas Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, after approval by the California Horse Racing Board, Santa 
Anita will offer its races for betting to Canterbury Downs in Minnesota and 
Birmingham Race Course in Alabama. Nevada's race books hope to be plugged into 
the same interstate network before the Oak Tree season ends, and all of the 
out-of-state bets will be included in the parimutuel pools at Santa Anita.

RAMS UNLIKELY TO OBTAIN ALLEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite another round of weekend rumors, there appears to be little chance 
running back Marcus Allen will become a Ram before next Tuesday's trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are ranked first in the NFL on offense, last on defense. 
</P>
<P>
They already have three former No. 1 draft choices in the backfield -- 
Cleveland Gary, Curt Warner and Gaston Green. Gary gained 92 yards in 20 
carries as the starting tailback against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent rumor concerning Allen and the Rams was reported by NBC 
correspondent and Boston Globe reporter Will McDonough, a long-time confidant 
of Raider owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had reportedly offered Allen to the Rams last summer for linebacker 
Kevin Greene, then a holdout. The latest report has the Raiders reducing the 
offer to a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers might also be interested in trading for Allen, with 
running back Roger Craig's status uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell said he is not sure how long the team will be without 
linebacker Ron Burton, who suffered a knee injury on the opening kickoff of the 
38-24 loss to the Bills in Buffalo Sunday night. CHRIS DUFRESNE

MOTOROLA STOCK SLIDES ON PROFIT REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Semiconductor producer Motorola Inc. reported weaker-than-expected 
third-quarter earnings Tuesday, sending the company's shares tumbling nearly 
12%. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola's stock fell $7, or 11.7%, to close at $52.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange after the company said its profit in the period was $102 million, up 
from $89 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But that was well below what analysts had predicted. The consensus was that 
Motorola would post earnings from 90 cents to "just over $1." 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said semiconductor product sales rose by a record 14% in the quarter 
but that its core cellular telephone businesses had lower operating profits, 
primarily because of heavy investments in technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company was nonetheless bullish about its performance, which included 
higher sales and earnings for the third quarter and the first nine months of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
George Fisher, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the 
third-quarter earnings were on target with Motorola's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the results," Fisher said in an interview, although he 
declined to comment on prospects for the balance of the year or on the 
company's stock activity. 
</P>
<P>
"Our customers are investing in Motorola products, systems and services that 
will improve productivity and efficiency and save time," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The Schaumberg, Ill.-based company reported that third-quarter sales rose 12% 
over the same period last year, to $2.7 billion from $2.41 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, profit rose to $390 million, from $366 
million in the year-ago period. Sales were $7.95 billion for the nine-month 
period, up from $6.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola released its earnings a day after it announced the settlement of a 
patent infringement lawsuit with Hitachi Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola has refused to give details of the settlement. Hitachi had threatened 
to cut off supplies of key parts to American computer manufacturers.

U.S. WORKERS WARY AFTER BEING SAVED BY THE BILL; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: A TEMPORARY MEASURE ASSURES JOBS UNTIL OCT. 19, LEAVING FEDERAL 
EMPLOYEES WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY, IRRITATION AND RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Excuse Sandy Denny, the office supervisor at the Social Security Administration 
office in Huntington Beach, if she yawned at work Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She had stayed up late Monday night to watch a broadcast about the fate of the 
federal budget -- and the fate of her job. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, President Bush and Congress agreed on a temporary funding 
bill early Tuesday to end a three-day federal government shutdown. And people 
like Denny trickled into work a few hours later with a mixture of joy, 
irritation and relief. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unsettling," Denny said. 
</P>
<P>
It's not necessarily the end, either. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary spending measure gives congressional leaders until Oct. 19 to 
complete work on a $500-billion budget package. Another stalemate could develop 
in 10 days. Tense negotiations over specific tax increases and spending cuts 
are expected, with lobbyists clamoring for special treatment by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all frustrated, not knowing day to day if we report to work or not," 
said Larry Boland, district manager of the Social Security offices in Ventura 
and Oxnard, who until the last-minute budget reprieve was planning to report to 
work Tuesday just long enough to dismiss his entire staff. 
</P>
<P>
William V. Evans, an Internal Revenue Service auditor in the Federal Building 
in Los Angeles and vice president of a chapter of the National Treasury 
Employees Union, was more cynical. 
</P>
<P>
"All along I've felt this (threatened shutdown) was just a tactic to try and 
get something done on the budget," said Evans, 56, who has worked for the IRS 
for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
The consternation of federal workers was rooted not only in the machinations of 
Congress but in years of frustration over wages that they believe are too low. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, because of budget cuts, federal salaries have fallen about 
30% behind private-sector pay. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements appeared possible in congressional budget hearings last month. The 
Senate approved an amendment authorizing a five-year, $5-billion program to 
raise federal pay by linking most government salaries to comparable jobs in 
local markets -- the first time such regional adjustments had been introduced 
to the federal pay system. 
</P>
<P>
John N. Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American Federation of 
Government Employees, called Tuesday for a rally in front of the White House on 
Thursday to urge Bush and Congress "to build a consensus . . . and ensure that 
this (shutdown) is never repeated." 
</P>
<P>
"We must stop the use of federal workers as pawns in this never-ending game of 
political chess and come up with a compromise package that does not once again 
unfairly place the burden of this country's financial woes on federal workers 
and retirees," Sturdivant said. 
</P>
<P>
Government workers first began to feel anxious in August when various 
departments notified some employees of potential furloughs if the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law took effect. As the new fiscal year 
approached on Oct. 1 without a budget, talk turned to the possibility of a 
complete shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
National parks and federal monuments were closed over the Columbus Day weekend 
after Congress failed to pass a bipartisan budget compromise and Bush vetoed a 
stopgap spending bill, leaving the government without legal authority to spend 
any money. 
</P>
<P>
Most federal workers had been told to report to work as usual on Tuesday, all 
the while aware that "non-essential" workers ranging from IRS auditors to meat 
inspectors would be sent home if no budget compromise had been reached 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, the normal complement of seven or eight air traffic 
controllers would have been reduced to about four if automatic Gramm-Rudman 
cuts had gone into effect. But operations were normal Tuesday and jets took off 
on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to be on furlough Tuesday, but I got a call Sunday that I was 
to come in," said Susan Thomas, the control tower area supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're considered an essential service, so I didn't think anything was going to 
happen to us today," Thomas added. "But it's a big concern to a lot of us here. 
This is a high cost-of-living area. People have car payments and rent to pay. 
The chance of losing half a day or a whole day of pay is a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Ramirez, a Social Security claims representative in Huntington Beach, said 
he would have been forced to get part-time work if Gramm-Rudman budget cuts had 
been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Like other federal workers interviewed Tuesday, Ramirez said he is reluctant to 
make plans unless a budget is made final before Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"Some friends had invited me to Colorado, but I've put all my vacation plans on 
hold," he said. "I just hope to God that we're not in the same position on the 
19th and we don't have to go through this nonsense again." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bonnie Brown, regional director of a small union that represents workers 
at two Navy bases near Oxnard: "The way I look at it, members of Congress are 
the only non-essential workers." 
</P>
<P>
Baker reported from Los Angeles, Efron from Orange County. Kenneth R. Weiss and 
Joanna M. Miller also contributed from Ventura.

DANA PARSONS: NOT IN LAGUNA, BUT WHAT'S THE RANGE ON THAT BULLDOZER? 
</P>

<P>
So they partied hearty at the Hotel Laguna the other night. Environmentalists 
and developers got all kissy-face and whispered sweet nothings in each other's 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
And the lion shall lie down with the lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was a moment of truly biblical proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at the ranch . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lest you think that the merry band in Laguna Beach has saved Orange County from 
bulldozers, object lessons abound to return you to reality. 
</P>
<P>
Had you been able to sit through a 2 1/2-hour session of the County Planning 
Commission on Tuesday, you would have had one rather sobering example. 
</P>
<P>
A 2,500-unit residential development known as Las Flores Planned Community hit 
a temporary snag, but not even opponents of the project seem to think it's in 
much trouble. "It'll evolve and be developed," Ray Chandos of the Rural Canyons 
Conservation Fund said matter-of-factly after the meeting. When it's built, 
it'll bring a few thousand more cars into already-crowded South County and have 
a traffic impact that county planners haven't computed yet. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, only a handful of people spoke in opposition to it Tuesday, and the 
organized opposition has focused not on stopping the project but on pushing 
back some of its boundaries to protect wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who have been in the trenches of other development fights know 
that one skirmish, such as the Laguna victory, does not a war win. 
</P>
<P>
Chandos is a veteran of the successful fight to save Laguna Canyon but said 
after the commission meeting Tuesday that he considers the developing of Las 
Flores to be pretty much a foregone conclusion. He sounded that note even after 
two of the five commissioners expressed reservations about the project. 
Commissioner Thomas Moody told the developers that they've picked "a helluva 
time to be asking for an extra 2,500 units." He said the public is "fed up" 
with development. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Hudecek isn't so sure. She was part of a losing effort to stop a huge 
residential project that will change the face of Orange during the next 20 
years. Although she thinks that her group could have succeeded if it had had 
more time, she's not convinced that the success of the Laguna environmentalists 
can be transferred to North County. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, they have an entirely different mind-set down there," 
Hudecek said. "One thing about those people, they have loaded their council 
with environmental people. If you're not an environmentalist, you don't sit on 
the council." 
</P>
<P>
But Peter DeSimone, the manager of the National Audubon Society Starr Ranch 
Sanctuary in Trabuco Canyon, said organized opposition hasn't surfaced to the 
Las Flores development: "Not enough people know what's going on. You have 
people just now learning about Las Flores who are going to be impacted by the 
traffic from it." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it's not necessarily too late for the public to get involved. 
"You organize something like the (Laguna) Canyon walk, and 50 people could have 
showed up. But 7,500 people showed up. On Las Flores, we're working with the 
commission and seeing how things shake out. If it turns out that the process 
goes wrong, then the next step is to see what the public thinks about it." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that cities and the county can't pick up the tab on every 
proposed development, as is the plan in Laguna Beach. "Things are pretty 
seriously going down as far as open space in Orange County is concerned," 
DeSimone said. "I think it'd be premature to go partying because we got one 
piece (in Laguna Canyon) preserved. There's a lot of work left to do here to 
plan the rest of the development in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone is obviously right. Flush with the victory in Laguna Canyon, which has 
unfolded during the last decade, some made euphoric claims about the historic 
nature of the fight and how it might signal a new day in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But in other parts of the county, residents know that much of the Laguna 
giddiness was probably the champagne talking.

CONSULTANT SAYS SURROGATE IS CHILD'S MOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: BIRTH MOTHERS ARE THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHERS, THE JUDGE IS TOLD AS THE 
JOHNSON-CALVERT CUSTODY HEARING GETS UNDER WAY.

The most important hearing in the landmark custody battle over a baby born to 
surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson opened Tuesday, featuring testimony that any 
woman who gives birth to a child has the right to call herself the parent even 
if the child is not genetically related to her. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michelle Harrison, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh and a 
consultant to the National Coalition Against Surrogacy, said that birth mothers 
are the biological mothers of the children they bear, even if another couple 
provided the egg and sperm that made the baby, as Mark and Crispina Calvert, an 
infertile couple, did in Johnson's case. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the mother of the baby because she gestated and gave birth to that 
child," said Harrison, who has studied the psychological impact of new 
reproductive technology on mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes her a mother is her emotional and physical work in nurturing the 
fetus and the way in which her body builds the baby. It brings oxygen. It takes 
away waste. It protects the baby from bacteria and external assault." 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the baby and the Calverts attacked the testimony of Johnson's 
witnesses, claiming that they were illogical and unqualified to act as experts 
on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who has counseled Johnson by telephone, was called as a witness by 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyers in what is expected to be a three-day hearing. Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. is confronted with an unprecedented 
decision: does the baby have two parents -- the Calverts -- or three, including 
Johnson? A three-parent ruling could redefine prevailing legal definitions of 
parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, who agreed to bear the Calverts' child for $10,000, hopes to 
establish that she should be considered the legal mother of the 3-week-old baby 
boy because she carried and delivered him. The Calverts, who have temporary 
custody of the child, believe that they are the baby's only true parents 
because they provided the genetic material from which he sprang. 
</P>
<P>
Blood and DNA tests have proved that the Calverts are the genetic parents of 
the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's second witness, San Diego clinical psychologist David B. Chamberlain, 
agreed with Harrison that a birth mother plays a greater role in giving life to 
a child than does a genetic mother. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain, author of a book called "Babies Remember Birth," said an infant's 
bond to its birth mother also justifies assigning her parental rights. He cited 
studies of infant-mother bonding indicating that newborns who have never seen 
their birth mothers before can recognize their pictures and identify them by 
odor and touch in a darkened room. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Tuesday's hearing turned into an uneasy exploration into the 
frontiers of morality, law, philosophy and biology. One such moment came as 
Harold LaFlamme, the baby's court-appointed lawyer, questioned Harrison about 
the logic she used to conclude that Johnson is the child's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who had just testified that Crispina Calvert's genetic contribution 
to the baby is less important than Johnson's gestational role, told LaFlamme 
that she considers Mark Calvert the child's father. Why, LaFlamme demanded, is 
it acceptable to define a father by his genetic contribution but not a mother? 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has created a new dilemma for us," Harrison said. "The old 
definition of father still works, but we're confronted with having to look 
again at our definition of mother." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, she added: "I'm not comfortable with any of this." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison stuck by her belief that a birth mother contributes more to the making 
of a child than do the sperm and egg donors. 
</P>
<P>
"Anna is the mother and the Calverts are the other half, like the father," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added later that the child essentially has three parents and that she 
believes that Johnson is the baby's true mother. She said Johnson has expressed 
deep feelings of attachment to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, asked whether Harrison had 
questioned Johnson to determine whether she was telling the truth about her 
feelings of bonding to the child. Harrison said she wanted to be "supportive" 
and not "interrogate" Johnson, so she had not. Van Deusen asked whether 
Harrison's opinion was affected by a July 23 letter that Johnson wrote to the 
Calverts, threatening to keep the child unless she was immediately paid the 
remainder of her $10,000 fee. Harrison said that did not matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Pregnant women faced with the loss of their baby say and do a lot of things to 
keep them," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen also tried to question the reliability of Johnson's claims by 
bringing up her guilty plea to two counts of welfare fraud, but Parslow barred 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to try that case in here, Mr. Van Deusen," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union entered the case Tuesday, filing a 
friend-of-the-court brief that argued all three adults have parental rights 
over the baby.

SCORCHING WINDS SHOULD EASE AS COOL AIR ARRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The desert-like winds that created a severe fire hazard in the county's 
bone-dry hills should ease today with arrival of cooler temperatures, 
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures should dip at least 15 degrees below Tuesday's highs, which 
reached up to 95 in parts of the county, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But the second day of scorching heat and blustery Santa Ana winds Tuesday 
prompted Orange County fire officials to place firefighters on alert and to 
urge residents to take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the two brush fires in Yorba Linda that burned seven acres 
Monday, county fire officials put two strike teams on active duty -- one in the 
Santiago Canyon area near Villa Park and one in Rancho Santa Margarita, in 
South County. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters "are loaded up, suited and ready to go," said Capt. Dan Young 
of the Orange County Fire Department. "They will be on the road within 
seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Winds blowing through the Santiago Canyon were clocked at 20 m.p.h., fire 
spokeswoman Maria Sabol said Tuesday. With humidity readings at 15% in that 
area, the Fire Department was poised to put its stations on red-flag alert, the 
highest priority status, had the winds increased by 5 m.p.h., she said. Winds 
of 50 m.p.h. were recorded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol said residents should take extra precautions now, especially because four 
years of scant rainfall have left the vegetation in the county's rural 
hillsides in a tinder-like condition. 
</P>
<P>
Young said firetrucks are on patrol, not only looking for signs of smoke but 
acting as deterrents. 
</P>
<P>
"Our engines are out there in high profile. They're monitoring and looking for 
problems. Just looking at a fire engine makes people think about fire 
prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Marty McKewon, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times, said that the Santa Ana condition was expected to subside by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
It was created when a high-pressure trough centered in Utah collided with a 
low-pressure system over the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
McKewon said that the weather condition is typical for mid-October. "This is 
not that unusual," he said. "This always starts happening this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
The winds heat up rapidly as they dive from the mountains into the Los Angeles 
Basin, he said. As a result, even the beaches lose the cooling benefit of ocean 
breezes, reaching temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spots in Orange County on Tuesday, McKewon said, were El Toro, where 
the temperature reached 94, the Santa Ana Civic Center, which recorded 95. 
</P>
<P>
"It's warmer in Santa Ana today than in Palm Springs," where the high was 94.

GANG SUSPECTS HELD IN VIRGINIA ROBBERY 
</P>

<P>
Two Westminster men suspected of ambushing a Vietnamese family at their home 
and holding them at gunpoint overnight were arrested in Virginia this weekend 
after a shoot-out with police at the family's jewelry store, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Trung Viet Cao, 19, and Charlie Hung Vu, 23, were booked on suspicion of 
robbery and abduction Saturday after the terrifying takeover of the family's 
home in Fairfax County, Va., outside of Washington. They are being held in lieu 
of $525,000 bond each. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Detective Marcus Frank, a specialist in Asian crime, said Cao is 
wanted in Westminster on an outstanding warrant charging him with strong-arm 
robbery. The allegations involve a "chain grab," a common crime in the Asian 
community in which jewelry is snatched off victims' necks. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said Cao and Vu are believed to associated with several Vietnamese gangs 
in the Orange County area, including the Natoma Boys. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax police said that on Friday evening several gunmen burst into the home 
of a jeweler and held his family at gunpoint until Saturday afternoon, when the 
jeweler agreed to drive the gunmen to his business in nearby Falls Church. 
</P>
<P>
After the gunmen left, the jeweler's family called police, who then confronted 
the suspects at the jewelry store. Vu tried to flee and was arrested, police 
said. Authorities said Trung came out of the store and exchanged gunfire with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Although wounded, Trung retreated to a restaurant and took five hostages before 
surrendering, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the involvement of young men from Westminster in a crime on the East 
Coast illustrates the typical "cross-country" capabilities of Vietnamese gangs, 
who live in one region of the nation and commit crimes in another. 
</P>
<P>
Although they do not always have accurate crime statistics, police say the 
Fairfax home invasion is part of an apparent increase in such robberies in 
Southeast-Asian communities across the nation.DAN WEIKEL

SMOLLER DIDN'T LIST EXPENSE, LEWIS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) filed a complaint with the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission on Tuesday, charging that his Democratic 
opponent in the Nov. 6 election, Fred Smoller, failed to report the cost of 
producing a cable television ad on his campaign finance statements. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have to live by the same kinds of laws that I do," said Lewis, who 
is seeking reelection to his 67th Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis added that he recently spent -- and reported -- $2,800 to produce a 
television spot. 
</P>
<P>
Smoller, a Chapman College professor and first-time candidate, said he did not 
report the production costs because Orange resident Jay Boylan produced the ad 
for just $50 -- less than the $100 threshold that mandates reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"The person donated his services to me as part of the campaign," Smoller said, 
adding that he would amend his statement if necessary. "I'm pleased that Mr. 
Lewis is paying so much attention to his opponent to point it out to me." 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said he normally would charge between $1,500 and $2,000 to produce an ad 
similar to Smoller's, which has been shown on Cablevision of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku declined to comment on Lewis' complaint but 
said donated professional services do not have to be reported as in-kind 
contributions. BOB SCHWARTZ

FRIZZELLE, TOLEDANO SPEAK AT UCI FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abraham Lincoln and Stephen F. Douglas engaged in them. So did Kennedy and 
Nixon, Dukakis and Bush and, this year, Feinstein and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 69th Assembly District, which encompasses parts of Irvine, Costa 
Mesa, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Westminster and Santa Ana, incumbent 
Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) would have no part of a debate. Instead, 
he insisted on separate appearances by him and his opponent, Democrat James 
Toledano, at UC Irvine on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked both candidates to debate," said Kevin Rose, a member of the UCI 
student association that sponsored Tuesday's candidates forum. "Frizzelle 
refused." 
</P>
<P>
After a 45-minute appearance in which he delivered a campaign speech and 
answered students' questions, Frizzelle said that he thinks that individual 
candidates' appearances are more valuable to voters than debates. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found in the debate format in the past that neither candidate gives 
their full convictions," Frizzelle said. If a candidate has the floor to 
himself or herself, he said, "then they have a tendency to come clear and give 
an honest answer instead of a hedged answer." 
</P>
<P>
Toledano strongly disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The democratic system is based on choice -- informed choice," Toledano said. 
"With no follow-up or rebuttal, you have a chance to swat a question away or 
answer it in a way that no one understands it. . . . If he is afraid to put his 
ideas in the marketplace of ideas, then he should resign." 
</P>
<P>
Frizzelle first addressed the crowd, which numbered about 25 students, 
outlining his philosophy of limited government. He said he opposes Prop. 128 -- 
the Big Green initiative -- in part because it would ban substances that in 
small amounts are not harmful to human beings, and he called for an end to 
government insurance of savings and loans and banks. Frizzelle proposed that 
instead, private insurers step in and charge financial institutions in 
accordance with their lending practices and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about abortion, Frizzelle, who has consistently voted 
against government funding for abortions and is morally opposed to abortion, 
said he has "always supported choice if it's thoroughly informed choice." 
</P>
<P>
Asked afterward what that meant, Frizzelle said that women should be told that 
"they are taking another life" and should be counseled on adoption and other 
alternatives. When pressed about whether he would ultimately favor allowing 
such "fully informed" women to have abortions if they chose, Frizzelle said, "I 
don't think government should make it legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Toledano, speaking after Frizzelle, said he supports Prop. 128, and he called 
for a much greater emphasis on education than has been heretofore given. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years Republicans have been running against crime, but they know no 
solutions -- they only look at it as a campaign issue," Toledano said. "We're 
building prisons for our elementary school kids but we're not building schools 
for them." BOB SCHWARTZ

TENANTS TELL OF HAZARDS AT COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cathy Barnette is afraid for the safety of her family. Rungs are missing on the 
stairway in their apartment complex, leaving a hole large enough for her small 
child to slip through. 
</P>
<P>
The gate to the pool is not secure and some of her neighbors' porches are so 
infested with termites that they must be propped up with makeshift beams. 
</P>
<P>
After spending a day without any hot water, Barnette and her husband decided to 
form a residents' group to demand action from the management of their apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of help, she got an eviction notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what grounds it would be," Barnette told the Cypress City Council 
Monday night. "We only want what is fair -- running water and gas." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people from the Lincoln-Moody Apartments at 9090 Moody St. came to the 
council meeting this week to ask for assistance. Outraged tenants recounted 
horror stories about leaking roofs, cockroach infestations and lack of running 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Holding up a filled-to-capacity cockroach "motel" as evidence, Rick Becker, a 
leader of the residents' group, told the council that tenants had been 
threatened with eviction if they showed up at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
To date, two residents have been served official notices, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
David Harper, part owner of the 144-unit complex responded to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think there are some problems," said Harper. "But I don't think it is as 
severe as it has been painted." 
</P>
<P>
The apartment complex was built in the early 1970s and is operated by 
California South West Management of Santa Monica. The one-, two- and 
three-bedroom units rent from $600 to $850 per month, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, who has been a partner since the apartment complex was built, admitted 
that many of the complaints are valid. He said that there has been a "history 
of plumbing and heating problems." 
</P>
<P>
The water is all on one line, he said, so any rupture forces a shutdown of the 
entire system, leaving tenants without water. "There have been times that we 
haven't been able to give (tenants) notice." 
</P>
<P>
Harper added that many of the apartments are being refurbished and attempts are 
being made to police the complex in order to reduce vandalism. And Harper said 
he would review the Barnettes' eviction notice. But property manager Roger 
Sturch told the council that the family was being evicted because Brad Barnette 
was abusive to him and other employees, not in retaliation for forming the 
residents' group. 
</P>
<P>
"It was within our right when we served the papers. We no longer wanted to do 
business with him," Sturch said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members urged the owners to respond to the tenants' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there are major problems," said Mayor Cecilia L. Age. "If we can't 
get cooperation we will get involved." The council agreed to go out and look at 
the property next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
City code enforcement officers found about 12 violations during a recent 
inspection, officials said, including uncovered heating ducts large enough for 
a child to fall through. 
</P>
<P>
After an additional inspection this week, officials said, the property managers 
will be notified of any code violations and will be given a chance to comply.

<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council candidate has moved to La Mirada, forcing him to abandon his 
campaign and leaving the race for two at-large seats to two incumbents and one 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Norman P. Eneim, a machine shop foreman, said he decided to end his bid because 
of a contractual commitment to buy a home in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could have run," he said Tuesday. "I'm a native La Habran, and I was 
a little brokenhearted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Although Eneim has dropped out, his name will appear on the ballot because he 
missed the deadline for removing his name from the race, City Clerk Sharie 
Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
If Eneim were to win the most votes, he would have to step down because he does 
not live in La Habra, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eneim's move out of the city could make Douglas Bystry's reelection bid more 
difficult, the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate David M. Cheverton, a businessman, and Mayor William D. Mahoney, who 
is also seeking reelection, say they are not running as a team, but their views 
are more similar to each other's than they are to Bystry's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely two against one," Bystry said. "It's going to make it a little 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
At a Chamber of Commerce candidate's forum, much discussion among the three 
candidates focused on city spending. Bystry is calling for city beautification, 
including more trees and shrubs and better graffiti removal, saying, "We can't 
afford not to beautify La Habra." 
</P>
<P>
Cheverton and Mahoney have said the costs of such a program would be too high, 
so the money should be spent on improving other city services. TED JOHNSON

<P>
In a city where 1989 estimates put the Latino population at 44% -- just under 
half the residents of Anaheim -- only two of the seven City Council candidates 
included Spanish versions of their campaign statements filed with the registrar 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in any county election can have their statements printed in both 
English and Spanish if they pay double the registration fee, or $600. But 
according to the registrar, the Spanish-language version is not required by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
In sample ballots flooding the homes of registered voters in Anaheim this week, 
Mayor Fred Hunter, who is seeking reelection, and one of his rivals, Councilman 
Irv Pickler, address their Spanish-speaking constituents. 
</P>
<P>
In English as well as in Spanish, Hunter states: "As mayor for the past two 
years, I have focused on quality-of-life issues. Many goals have been 
accomplished because we've worked together." 
</P>
<P>
Just next to that appears Pickler's statement, also in both languages: "Anaheim 
citizens deserve effective leadership which solves problems and works to 
improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates said the higher fee was the reason they did not file their 
statements in both languages. 
</P>
<P>
"I intended to run a close, grass-roots campaign, saving every dollar I could," 
said Frank Feldhaus, a planning commissioner who is running for council. 
</P>
<P>
Feldhaus, who speaks fluent Spanish, said he would rather spend the time 
walking door-to-door meeting potential supporters personally, and talking to 
them directly in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran across one (Spanish-speaking) household the other day. . . . I must have 
spent 20 minutes there," said Feldhaus, adding that taking the time to talk 
with the family was worthwhile. "I got five of 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Others cited the general expense of running a campaign and the need to cut 
corners whenever possible. One candidate, political maverick John Schaffer, is 
not raising campaign funds, he said, so did not pay the extra $300. LISA

NELSON RESIGNS AS SEAL BEACH CITY MANAGER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Robert Nelson, caught in the middle of this coastal community's 
battles over new development, has resigned for personal reasons, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said that Nelson's resignation had been rumored for several weeks 
because of differences with council members elected in May who have opposed 
Mola Development Corp.'s controversial Hellman Ranch housing project, as well 
as other projects. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 51, who lives in Del Mar, was not available for comment. He said in a 
prepared statement that he will miss working for Seal Beach but wants to devote 
more time to his children, ages 27, 24, 6, and 2. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation takes effect Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own opinion and in that of some of the other residents, he had trouble 
making the adjustment that the Mola project was not wanted by most of the 
city," said Galen Ambrose, president of the Wetlands Restoration Society, which 
opposes the Hellman Ranch project. "We feel this now will give the council 
confidence in hiring somebody they feel will carry out their directives." 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach is beset with problems, including a recent Orange County Grand Jury 
report that sharply criticized the Police Department and lawsuits against 
Mola's proposal to build houses on the Hellman Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The previous council approved Mola's plans, but the new council rescinded that 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe, a member of the new council majority, said she did 
not want to comment on residents' speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"In my short term on the City Council, Mr. Nelson has provided me with the 
information necessary to make important decisions for the city of the Seal 
Beach. He will be missed," she said. "I understand that it is a personal 
decision to spend more time with his young children." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson worked as city manager in Del Mar before coming to Seal Beach four years 
ago, Councilwoman Edna Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through an awful lot of things with him," said Wilson, the only 
council member remaining from the time Nelson was hired. "We've had an awful 
lot of problems, and he's been very good. I'm just very sorry to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said she was notified last week of his resignation while she was in the 
San Francisco Bay Area visiting her ill sister. She said she was uncertain why 
city officials waited until late Tuesday to announce the resignation, which was 
discussed by the council in closed session following its regular meeting Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some final points that had to be decided on," Wilson said. "I'm not 
sure why it wasn't announced last night. I don't know whose decision it was." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said she was not certain what Nelson plans to do next or who will act as 
city manager after he leaves.

AFTER LAST YEAR'S TITLE, WATER POLO TEAM FALLS FROM PEDESTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing succeeds like success, so they say. 
</P>
<P>
And success breeds success -- they say. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's water polo team won the NCAA championship last year, and the 
players enjoyed the view from the lofty heights. 
</P>
<P>
But now they know its depths. 
</P>
<P>
At least it feels that way. The defending national champions lost to the 
University of the Pacific, 12-10, Sunday for the first time in 30 meetings; it 
was the first time Irvine had ever lost Pacific, dating to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
It was demoralizing -- gut-wrenching, even -- but was it inconceivable? 
</P>
<P>
Not really, says Ted Newland, the Anteater coach who has guided Irvine to three 
national championships in 25 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think winning a national championship for a lot of people is a real downer," 
Newland said. "It's not an easy thing to deal with. You get there, and the 
players think they're going to ring the bells and it will last forever. It 
doesn't last very long. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to start all over again. They want to remain where they are because 
they won. It's not a very easy thing get across." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has a record of 8-8 this season after losing five key players from the 
national championship team. The Anteaters knew they had work ahead of them -- 
or should have known, Newland said. Sophomore Pablo Yrizar and junior Skylar 
Putman were the only returning starters on a roster that includes six 
upperclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started early, when they finished sixth in their own tournament 
after losing three games to highly ranked teams, all by one-goal margins. 
</P>
<P>
"When the season started, (the team) hadn't taken the time during the summer 
and spring to do all the work they needed to," Newland said. "They hadn't done 
enough weights and spent time doing the things they should do. They thought 
they would be competitive that way. Many people don't look at things very 
realistically. They have a lot of things they'd rather do, like all human 
beings. You can tell them, but you can't force them. . . . If you're young and 
weak you've got to put more time in. You've got to work extra hard to catch 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the question is whether the Anteaters can catch up in time to qualify for 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we should be trying to qualify for this or win that at this 
time," Newland said. "I try to deal with it one game at a time. We can still 
make (the NCAA field) but we will have to play extremely well from here on out. 
We can't afford to lose a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
Although his team is struggling, it is likely to bring Newland an honor shortly 
-- his 500th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Newland has a record of 498-175-5, after losing, 7-5, Tuesday to Cal State Long 
Beach. The team plays UC San Diego on Friday at Heritage Park in Irvine and 
travels to UC Santa Barbara on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't much care -- big deal," said Newland, who estimates he has won 3,000 
games if his high school, club and international records are included. 
</P>
<P>
"So what's 500 next to 3,000?" he said. "I'm an old man, I don't deal with 
those things. It's nice. I'd rather win 500 than lose 500." 
</P>
<P>
At 62, Newland said he is not yet planning to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I may coach till I'm 70, if they allow me," he said. "I think I'm a better 
coach than I've ever been, why not continue on?" 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is playing host to the Rolex-Southern California Women's Collegiate 
Tennis Championships at the UCI tennis stadium beginning with qualifying 
matches today. 
</P>
<P>
Alison Yoshimoto is the only Irvine player who made the draw without 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Giovanna Carotenuto of U.S. International, 18th in the nation in preseason 
rankings, is the top-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
There is no admission charge to the tournament, which begins at 8 a.m. today 
and Thursday, at 9 a.m. Friday and Saturday, and concludes with the singles 
final at 10 a.m. Sunday, followed by the doubles final. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea-Olinda High School girls' basketball team lost only one game last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine women's team won only one. 
</P>
<P>
The twain shall meet when Jinelle Williams, Brea-Olinda's senior center, joins 
the Irvine team next fall, provided she qualifies under NCAA academic 
regulations and is admitted to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who averaged 14.4 points and eight rebounds per game last season, 
says she will sign a national letter of intent during the NCAA's early signing 
period that begins Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The question to Williams is simple: Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's close to here," said Williams, who also considered New Mexico 
State and Florida. "I really didn't really want to go far away. They are 
recruiting a lot of people in the next couple of years that could turn it 
around. It'll be a change . . . I'm used to winning. (Playing at Irvine) will 
just make me work that much harder to try to help them win. That will be the 
main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Before she joins the Anteaters, who had a 1-27 record last season, Williams has 
a final season with the Wildcats, whose 55-game winning streak was broken by 
Auburn Placer in the Division III state final last March. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was an honorable mention selection on The Times' all-county team last 
season, placing her among the top 16 players in Orange County. She was one of 
only three players selected who were not seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Her hopes for this season? 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go all the way," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Best to win while the winning is good. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
The women's cross-country team rose five places to seventh in the nation after 
finishing second to Brigham Young at Saturday's Stanford Invitational. Irvine's 
Buffy Rabbitt finished second to Wisconsin's Suzy Favor, considered the best 
collegiate middle-distance runner in the country. . . . Irvine's club lacrosse 
team will host the Ballantine's Fall Invitational Oct. 27-28 at Crawford Field. 
Sixteen collegiate and club teams will participate, including Chapman, Loyola 
Marymount, San Diego State, UC San Diego and San Diego. The Irvine team, which 
plays a 12-game schedule beginning in January, also will host the UCI Fall 
Invitational Nov. 17-18, featuring eight college teams. . . . The men's golf 
team finished seventh of 18 teams at the New Mexico State Classic last weekend. 
Joey Sugar, a junior from Esperanza High School, and freshman William 
Yanagisawa were the Anteaters' best finishers, tying for 15th.

DESPITE 'MAJOR PROBLEMS ON DEFENSE,' NO ONE IS POINTING FINGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This 1-3 start has Ram Coach John Robinson worrying about more than how to put 
some pressure on opposing quarterbacks. He's also concerned about his players 
sacking each other's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram offense is the NFL's best; the defense ranks dead last. Would an 
offensive player dare mutter a discouraging word about the defense? 
</P>
<P>
" 'I confess, it's their fault.' That's one of the most natural reactions," 
Robinson said. "People want to blame other parts of the team to rationalize 
their own performance. Those are things we all seek when we're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is that we play the game without beginning to look at 
individuals or identifying weaknesses in players." 
</P>
<P>
No one in blue and gold has publicly pointed a finger at a teammate, but in the 
wake of Sunday's overtime loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, there has been a 
little grumbling about areas of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you give a quarterback that much time, any time he's able to wait, 
wait, wait like that, somebody is going to get open," said safety Michael 
Stewart. "The secondary can't do much about that." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson points out that while the lack of a pass rush has indeed hurt the 
Rams, the secondary has made more than its share of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The pass rush, not making plays in the secondary, when you begin to separate 
those things and point a finger at some group of individuals or some 
individual, well, I can't remember once when I felt those kinds of analyses 
were fair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously have major problems on defense, but we have a lot of people who 
are pressing, playing with apprehension and making mistakes that shock us." 
</P>
<P>
Safety Vince Newsome, who was acutely aware that he had spent far too much time 
Sunday afternoon chasing Cincinnati receivers -- many of whom already had the 
ball -- decided the Rams' high-and-mighty-No. 1-ranked offense should shoulder 
some of the blame. (Maybe he forgot that Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason 
completed nine of his first 13 passes while Cincinnati took a 21-0 lead). 
</P>
<P>
"We need to keep the defense off the field more," Newsome said. "It's not just 
the offense that's coming up flat, though, the whole team is." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome might not be far out of line, says Robinson, who agrees that the 
offensive players shouldn't get too cocky. The Rams may be racking up the 
passing yards, but they're not putting the ball in the end zone at crunch time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the much-riddled and much-ridiculed defense kept Cincinnati from 
scoring on eight of its final 11 possessions Sunday. Meanwhile, the offense had 
three opportunities to move the ball within range of a game-winning field goal 
and failed each time. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense didn't score when they had a chance to win the game," Robinson 
said. "We're probably getting more than what we expected from our offense, 
however, I think our offense has been remiss in not making the plays at the end 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
A porous defense and a big-play offense that misfires in the clutch has added 
up to a slow start for a franchise that usually gets a jumpstart on the season. 
So Robinson is left to ponder the effects of a psychological element of the 
game he usually doesn't have to even consider. Being team psychologist hasn't 
been a big part of his job description in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much external criticism and doubt, I mean that's just the way it is 
when you're losing," Robinson said. "Players begin to lose their confidence. 
But we have to build on the things we're doing OK. We have to make sure we 
maintain a belief that we're capable of doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our team has always done a pretty good job of realizing it's a team 
game. The players tend to trust each other. The key when you're in a difficult 
position is to believe in yourself. We can't doubt ourselves, and making sure 
we don't is part of my job." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a duty that falls on the shoulders of team leaders, such as 
cornerback Jerry Gray, who remembered to emphasize the team unity concept 
minutes after Sunday's disheartening loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing now is that we have to stick together," he said.

NEW PRESIDENT NAMED AT RICOH ELECTRONICS

<P>
Ricoh Electronics Inc. has named a new president, Katsumi Yoshida, to succeed 
Koichi Endo, who has been reassigned to the Tokyo parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida, who formerly headed parent Ricoh Co. Ltd.'s overseas production 
division in Tokyo, will oversee Ricoh Electronics' three Orange County 
manufacturing sites, where more than 90% of the unit's 1,300 employees are 
based. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin-based unit is opening a fourth manufacturing plant today in Gwinnett 
County, Ga., to supply Ricoh customers east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida comes to his post as Ricoh Electronics' sales are declining. Its sales 
in 1989 were $216 million, down 9% from $236.4 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman declined to say whether Endo's transfer was related to the 
sales decline. 
</P>
<P>
Endo has been named general manager of the parent firm's office copier 
components division in Tokyo, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Regan, a company spokesman in New York, said Yoshida's expertise is in 
production for overseas markets. Yoshida will head the company's plans to 
expand U.S. sales of its products, which include office copiers, toners and fax 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Ricoh ranks as the fifth-largest supplier of office copiers, after Canon, 
Xerox, Sharp and Mita. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida is no stranger to Orange County. He started Ricoh's operations in 1973 
and headed the local division through 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida was in Georgia and unavailable for comment.

$165,000 RAISED FOR SPEECH, HEARING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Scene 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 supporters of the Providence Speech and Hearing Center strolled 
under a double arch of pink and black balloons and into a ballroom at the 
Anaheim Marriott hotel Saturday for cocktails, dinner and dancing. The 
$250-per-person benefit raised about $165,000, which will be used for 
operational expenses, said Executive Director O.T. Kenworthy. 
</P>
<P>
The Cause 
</P>
<P>
Located in the city of Orange, the nonprofit center provides diagnostic testing 
and therapy for an estimated 5,800 speech- or hearing-impaired clients a year. 
About 250 clients receive ongoing speech pathology or audiology treatment, 
according to Kenworthy. "Our biggest problem is that we provide the services, 
and then we have to wait a long while to get our money from the insurance 
companies or state agencies," he said. "It's not unusual for a bill to go eight 
or nine months before it's paid. . . . But we don't turn anybody away. Anybody 
who can't communicate -- how can you turn them away?" 
</P>
<P>
Stars of the Show 
</P>
<P>
Everybody wanted to talk with Margaret Anne Inman, the tiny, bespectacled 
bundle of energy who founded the center in 1966. Arriving 45 minutes after the 
start of cocktail hour, Inman was immediately surrounded by her longtime 
friends and admirers. Also drawing a significant share of attention was honoree 
Katarina Matesevac, a 24-year-old Providence alumnae who at 15 months old had 
become Inman's second client. The shy Katarina -- a graduate of El Modena High 
School in Orange -- stuck close to her mom, Anne Matesevac, her sister Celeste 
and brothers Ivan and Joseph. Anne Matesevac recalled that when Inman "took 
Katarina under her wings, everybody told her, 'Forget it. You're wasting your 
time.' But she didn't listen. She knew she could help my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
The Program 
</P>
<P>
After hosted cocktails and silent auction bidding, guests headed into the 
dining room for a dinner of beef broth en croute, salad with white asparagus, 
filet mignon with bearnaise sauce and lobster tail. Following blackberry sponge 
cake with vanilla sauce and raspberry liqueur, comedian Danny Gans and the Jeff 
Enloe Orchestra entertained. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
George DeHuff chaired a dinner committee that included John Ricci Jr., Steve 
Howard, John Word, Fifi Chao, Doris Weaver, Robert Diamond, William Reilly, 
Mell Kilpatrick and Joseph Maioriello. 
</P>
<P>
Among other guests were Margaret and Carl Karcher, Mary and Peter Muth, Helga 
and Robert Pralle, Tamara and Bruce Achauer and renown ear surgeon Dr. Howard 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Quote 
</P>
<P>
In normal business practices, you can't spend more money than you have," said 
Peter Muth, who with Robert Pralle challenged the board of directors in May to 
raise $125,000. (By August, the board had raised its share, which was then 
matched by both Muth and Pralle -- for a total of $375,000.) "But you have to 
remember we are helping children, so we go overboard. When there's a kid out 
there who needs help, we throw caution to the wind." PAMELA MARIN

RELATIONSHIPS: DIMENSIONS OF DEMENTIA; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY STRUGGLES TO RECONCILE IMAGES OF A VITAL MAN THEY LOVE WITH THE DAILY 
REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Every morning before she leaves for work, Linda gives her husband a list of 
things to do and prays that it will keep him out of trouble while she's gone. 
</P>
<P>
It usually does because he follows it with a childlike eagerness to please the 
high school sweetheart he married 39 years ago. After completing every task, 
the man Linda had always depended on as the primary breadwinner and 
decision-maker in their family sits in front of the TV and waits for his wife 
to come home. And, he says, "I try to think of how to get myself in an 
operational mode." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in short sentences and phrases that prematurely fade into silence, Ed 
tells his visitor: "I've tried to go back to work. . . . It would be more of a 
miracle if it came through . . . because of the constraints of my dementia." 
</P>
<P>
 My dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 This youthful, energetic 57-year-old who should be enjoying the prime of his 
life speaks with a startling matter-of-factness about how he is losing his 
mind: "I'll be trying to explain something to someone, and all of a sudden I've 
dropped off and I'm not talking. It just goes." 
</P>
<P>
He finishes with a helpless shrug and a quizzical look that his 56-year-old 
wife finds completely out of character in the tall, handsome, take-charge man 
she married at 17. 
</P>
<P>
Ed, who has striking blue eyes and white hair, is at such an early stage of 
memory loss that he doesn't belong in the facilities that provide care and 
companionship for people with dementia, most of whom are over 65. He is set 
apart by his age and his awareness of what is happening to him. 
</P>
<P>
He's jovial and coherent enough among strangers -- and in brief conversations 
with friends -- to give the impression that nothing's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A part of him must believe that because he still reads the classifieds and 
sends out resumes. But the truth is poignantly evident in Linda's tired, 
often-tearful brown eyes, which reflect a burden -- financial, physical and 
emotional -- that is so overwhelming that she once found herself screaming in 
the shower. 
</P>
<P>
She and her youngest son agreed to talk about their family's ordeal on 
condition that their real names not be used. 
</P>
<P>
Linda would like to be able to say her family, which once enjoyed carefree 
summers of boating and scuba diving together, has pulled together in this 
crisis. But, she muses, she and her three grown children are like people who 
have just been dumped out of an unstable canoe: "Everyone grabs for something 
to stay afloat before they can help each other." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest, a 38-year-old Vietnam veteran with mental health problems, spends 
time with his dad but suffers after each visit from the depressions to which he 
is prone. 
</P>
<P>
His 36-year-old sister, who lives in Hawaii and has the only grandchild, has 
cut off all contact with her parents; Linda fears that Ed will no longer 
remember his daughter if she doesn't visit soon. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, 26, was also living in Hawaii when he was told of his father's dementia, 
but he came home soon after. He now lives with his parents in a small Orange 
County apartment that reflects the scaled-down lifestyle they had to adopt when 
Ed was no longer able to work in the construction business and Linda had to 
find a job after years of homemaking. 
</P>
<P>
She began to notice that Ed was having difficulties about three years ago but 
thought it was just work stress. He started losing things, asked her to do his 
bookkeeping because he couldn't get the figures to add up and began answering 
simple questions in ways that didn't make sense. When he got lost for 2 1/2 
hours in an airport while they were on vacation a year ago, she knew she had to 
get him to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
The tests that began soon after that are still under way, but doctors have told 
Linda there's just a 2% chance that Ed has Alzheimer's disease -- the diagnosis 
most often given patients with his symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, there are more than 
70 others, some of which can be treated, according to Mildred Lee, nurse 
coordinator of the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ed, who is being tested at the UCI center, may have suffered from a series of 
small strokes, which, along with Alzheimer's, accounts for 80% of dementia 
cases, Lee notes. 
</P>
<P>
But his dementia may also be related to high blood pressure or the alcoholism 
he conquered years ago. (Among other causes are medications, brain tumors and 
infections, depression and rare diseases that cause brain damage, including 
Pick's, Huntington's and Parkinson's.) 
</P>
<P>
The brain damage Ed has already suffered can't be reversed, Lee says, but the 
remaining tests will help determine the cause of his dementia and whether 
anything can be done to slow down its progression. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his family is still in shock. They haven't begun the kind of talk 
that often takes place when there is an early diagnosis of dementia -- the 
decisions about the future that are best made when the patient can still speak 
for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Linda says that will happen eventually, but "now my goal is just one day at a 
time, making ends meet, getting food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
They are just getting by on her modest income. The relief she feels that she 
could use her accounting skills to get a job is matched by her guilt over 
leaving Ed alone -- and an endless fatigue that makes it hard to be patient and 
loving with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I get angry when he asks me 20 questions or loses things," she admits, "but I 
try to think of the good things he does every day. If he does get worse, I want 
him to always hear, 'I love you. You're the best friend, lover, companion -- 
even fighting buddy -- I've ever had.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to let him know that when he gives her so little breathing room, 
following her around the apartment as if he's afraid he'll lose her. 
</P>
<P>
"He's becoming very, very dependent on me," Linda says. 
</P>
<P>
His world is gradually shrinking. Although he recently had his driver's license 
renewed, he gets disoriented in unfamiliar areas. ("It's probably time for an 
ID bracelet," Linda tells him. "Yes," he answers. "We've been talking about 
that.") 
</P>
<P>
He also has begun to get panicky in elevators and hotel rooms. "My world is a 
kind of small area right now," he says. "I'm afraid of situations I might get 
into." 
</P>
<P>
Ed, who can vividly remember his boyhood but forgets things that happened 30 
seconds ago, helps Linda by doing the grocery shopping -- she signs the check 
and the clerk writes the amount down for him -- and some housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
And it's clear he would like to do more. For example, when she pays the bills, 
one of his former responsibilities, he stands over her restlessly. "He knows 
he's supposed to be there, but he doesn't know why," Linda explains. 
</P>
<P>
Her frustration is eased when her son, Mike, takes over. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle, soft-spoken man who has his father's good looks, he says spending 
"quality time" with Ed is especially important to him now. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he embraced their moments together as though time was quickly running 
out. He took Ed on a camping trip and other outings closer to home. Now he 
realizes that helping to care for his dad is going to be a long, day-to-day 
process. 
</P>
<P>
And, like his mother, he has to fight the frustration he feels when Ed starts a 
sentence and finishes it 15 minutes later, or when they're talking and his dad 
nods in agreement but doesn't seem to really hear him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to sit back and talk to him again. I miss my old dad," says Mike, who 
helps his mom by paying rent, doing household chores and keeping her car 
running. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to put my life aside, but he's worth it," he adds. "I love him 
dearly. He's like a little kid now in an adult body. There's no way you can 
turn your back on that and walk away." 
</P>
<P>
It bothers him that his sister has lost touch with her father. "I'd like to see 
everybody getting closer rather than farther apart," he says. "We should be 
spending as much time with dad as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Messinger, a Santa Ana social worker and gerontologist, says it's not 
unusual for grown children to withdraw when a parent is diagnosed with 
dementia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult for an adult child to see his parents as less than 
competent," says Messinger, who will lead a support group for spouses of 
younger dementia victims that is being started this month by the Alzheimer's 
Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Families find it hard to pull together, she adds, because "any vulnerabilities 
or conflicts or relationship issues that are already there come to the 
forefront in a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Linda, who plans to participate in Messinger's support group, is struggling 
with her relationships with friends as well as family. She knows that many 
friends are uncomfortable because they don't know how to deal with her pain -- 
and don't understand why she looks worse than Ed. 
</P>
<P>
"People know you're hurting, but they feel there should be a time limit and 
then you should switch back to your normal mode. You have to have a smile on 
your face and say everything is fine. That's what people want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
She knows the support group will help her feel less isolated. But it won't be 
enough. She also needs to see her family reunited. 
</P>
<P>
"What I miss most is the laughter we all used to have," she says. "You take 
things for granted. You don't realize you need to hang onto each day." 
</P>
<P>
Linda vacillates between tears and the conviction that she will find the 
strength to deal with whatever is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
She admits that she's still hoping for a miracle. "I cling to Ed now, not 
wanting to let him change. But deep down I know it has to happen." 
</P>
<P>
She desperately wants to find a way for Ed to feel that he's accomplishing 
something. She tried enrolling him in a college computer class, but he couldn't 
keep up with the other students. She's also considered getting him involved in 
some kind of volunteer work but hasn't been able to find anything. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes when Linda feels like giving up, Ed's optimism keeps her going: "I 
try to do the best I can with what I've got. . . . I want to get out and do 
things. I'll do it when the time comes."

RELATIONSHIPS: UNDERSTANDING DEMENTIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Researched by: APRIL D. JACKSON / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, there are more than 
70 others. Dementia may be triggered by strokes, high blood pressure, 
alcoholism, medications, brain tumors and infections, depression and rare 
diseases that cause brain damage, including Pick's, Huntington's and 
Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
</P>
<P>
The disease most closely associated with aging, Alzheimer's causes the 
progressive deterioration of the brain to such an extent as to render victims 
unable to recognize their spouses and immediate family. The patient may become 
confused, unable to concentrate and have trouble finishing sentences. More than 
70% of the patients had behavioral disorders, such as unprovoked 
aggressiveness. Over time, Alzheimer's leaves victims as helpless (and just as 
needing) as children. 
</P>
<P>
No treatment is available to stop or reverse its degenerative effects. 
</P>
<P>
MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA 
</P>
<P>
Multi-infarct dementia, or vascular dementia, is caused by multiple strokes 
(infarcts) in the brain. Because the strokes usually occur before the symptoms 
of dementia appear, the onset of the dementia seems sudden. The strokes affect 
the part of the brain responsible for specific functions, such as calculations, 
and create the more generalized symptoms of disorientation and behavioral 
changes. Because of multi-infarct dementia's similarity to Alzheimer's, the two 
coexist in 15% to 20% of dementia patients. 
</P>
<P>
No cure or reversing process exists, but early assessment of cause can halt the 
progression of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
PARKINSON'S DISEASE 
</P>
<P>
Those with Parkinson's lack dopamine in their systems. This neurotransmitter 
helps control the tremor, stiffness and slowness characteristic of the disease. 
In late stages, some patients develop dementia. Parkinson's patients often 
develop Alzheimer's and, at times, Alzheimer's patients develop Parkinson's 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs can treat the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's but do not 
improve any mental deterioration. Parkinson's is considered a model for drug 
research on Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollars and Financial Impact 
</P>
<P>
Fewer research dollars go toward studying Alzheimer's disease, and other 
dementing illnesses, than heart disease, cancer or AIDS. Yet, Alzheimer's, the 
fourth-leading cause of death among adults in the country, claims more than 
100,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4 million seniors suffer from the disease nationally, while Orange 
County has 40,000 Alzheimer's victims who struggle to cope with the 
mysteriously debilitating brain disorder. 
</P>
<P>
There is no known reason why the disease strikes people over the age of 60, and 
there is no known cure for this ultimately fatal disease. Further, total costs, 
which include diagnosis, treatment, long-term care and lost wages, is estimated 
to be more than $88 billion each year. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government covers $4.4 billion of these costs and state coffers are 
dipped into for another $4.1 billion. But the remaining $79 billion is borne by 
Alzheimer's patients and their families.

Differences Between AAMI and Alzheimer's Disease 
</P>
<P>
The term age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) refers to the minor memory 
difficulties that come with age, or are often brought on by stress. AAMI 
differs from Alzheimer's disease, and other related dementias, in that AAMI is 
neither debilitating nor progressive. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly thought of as "forgetfulness," AAMI can be brought on by grief, 
depression, illness, stress, medication, alcohol, fatigue, lack of 
concentration or just attempting to remember too many details at once.

Alzheimer's Disease 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease, often mistakenly thought to be the definition of dementia, 
is the most commonly known of the 60 possible causes of senile dementia. 
</P>
<P>
Declines in intellectual functions and in the ability to perform routine 
activities often renders dementia victims virtually without memory, as 
dependent as infants on the support of others to feed, clothe and bathe 
themselves. A steady loss of brain cells intensifies the symptoms of 
deteriorating memory, impaired judgment, depression, a lack of concentration 
and restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, people 75 years and older ran the greatest risk of falling victim to 
the debilitating and often incurable symptoms of senile dementia. And, within 
the next 50 years, as the nation's senior population grows, the number of 
dementia patients is expected to triple. 
</P>
<P>

What Is Dementia? 
</P>
<P>
Dementia is a term applied to a group of progressively debilitating symptoms, 
including the inability to learn or remember information, repetitive behavior, 
inarticulateness and personality and behavioral changes. 
</P>
<P>
Even at advanced ages, memory loss that interferes with everyday life is not 
normal. Any person exhibiting an increased inability to think or reason should 
contact one of the local assessment centers in Orange County or consult a 
neurologist to determine the cause of the dementia. 
</P>
<P>
Progression rates of dementia vary, and depending on the condition causing the 
brain cells to deteriorate, often the symptoms can be minimized to slow 
progress of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
FACTS ABOUT DEMENTIA YOU SHOULD KNOW: 
</P>
<P>
* Nearly 20% of the causes of dementia can be corrected. Thyroid imbalances, 
brain tumors, drug intoxication, alcoholism and infections are just a few of 
the many treatable, and reversible, causes of dementia. 
</P>
<P>
* Alzheimer's disease is not a generic term for forgetfulness. Rather, 
Alzheimer's is the most common form of the progressive, degenerative and, 
ultimately, fatal diseases that produce dementia. Parkinson's disease, 
multi-infarct dementia, Huntington's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and multiple 
sclerosis are other well-known diseases whose link to dementia are 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
* Early signs of dementia include memory problems, depression, anxiety and an 
inability to concentrate long enough to read or follow the plot of television 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
* In Orange County, there are more than 40,000 victims of Alzheimer's disease. 
Nationally, an estimated 4 million seniors are affected by the disease. By the 
year 2040, the total number of Alzheimer's disease victims is expected to 
triple. 
</P>
<P>
* Over 50% of all nursing home patients suffer from dementia-related disorders. 
The annual cost of nursing facility care ranges from $24,000 to $36,000. 
</P>
<P>
* An estimated 70% of all Alzheimer's victims are cared for at home, by their 
families. Annual costs of home care are approximately $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Congress is considering increasing the amount in federal spending allotted 
for Alzheimer's disease research to $132 million in fiscal year 1990, an 
increase that would average out to a little more than $50 per patient. By 
comparison, the National Institutes of Health invests 10 times that amount for 
research on cancer, heart disease and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
* In the case of Alzheimer's, there is no cure and the cause of the disease is 
not known.

CINEMA: THE PUBLIC HOUNDS ORANGE'S PIERCE LYDEN, KING OF THE BLACK HATS IN B 
WESTERNS, AT THE SIERRA FILM FESTIVAL IN LONE PINE, SETTING OF MANY HORSE 
OPERAS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ceremony celebrating 70 years of filmmaking in the rugged Alabama Hills 
completed, the white-haired gentleman in the black cowboy hat and fancy Western 
duds tramped over the sagebrush-dotted landscape to have his picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
"That was quite a thing," said former B-Western movie badman Pierce Lyden of 
Orange, a featured guest at the first Sierra Film Festival, held last weekend 
in this tiny town in the shadow of Mt. Whitney on the eastern side of the 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," mused Lyden, 82, "I saw a lot of the old fellas today." 
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday afternoon ceremony, Lyden's old friend, Roy Rogers -- the 
festival's guest of honor -- dedicated a plaque commemorating Lone Pine's role 
as one of Hollywood's favorite locations since 1920. 
</P>
<P>
For at least four decades, the sound of gunfire and hoofbeats regularly echoed 
through the Alabama Hills, as the heroic likes of Rogers, Tom Mix, Buck Jones, 
Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and John Wayne galloped through the area's 
picturesque rocks and boulders. 
</P>
<P>
And Lyden, one of the baddest Black Hats in B Westerns, spent many days in the 
Alabama Hills squaring off with Roy, Hoppy and Hollywood's other legendary 
White Hats. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all over this place, but I worked mostly in the 'Bama rocks," recalled 
Lyden, squinting into the afternoon sun as he surveyed the huge boulders in the 
distance, where he took more than a few tumbles for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
As Lyden says: "I think I've got my name on every one of the rocks. It's 
painful to look at some of them." 
</P>
<P>
The retired actor, looking spiffy in his pearl-buttoned Western shirt with its 
silver-tipped collar, was interrupted by a young woman asking him to autograph 
her book on Western movies. 
</P>
<P>
A smile danced across the movie badman's craggy face. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you want me to sign?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
A chance to bag an autograph from one of the guest celebrities who worked on 
Westerns filmed in Lone Pine was just one of the draws of the Sierra Film 
Festival, which attracted more than 2,000 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
During a Sunday morning panel discussion, fans were treated to firsthand 
filmmaking memories. Participants included Lyden, stuntman-turned-actor Richard 
Farnsworth ("The Grey Fox"), singing cowboy Eddie Dean, Rand Brooks ("Lucky" in 
the Hopalong Cassidy series), stuntman Joe Yrigoyen (Roy Rogers' stunt double), 
movie bad guy Terry Frost, stuntman Jack Williams, former Rogers leading lady 
Linda Hayes and Rogers' director, William Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day event, co-sponsored by the California Arts Council and the Inyo 
Council for the Arts, also featured stunt shows in the Alabama Hills and 
screenings in the high school auditorium. The Saturday night showing of the 
classic "Gunga Din," perhaps the most famous film shot in Lone Pine, was a 
sellout. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled Farnsworth, who earned $7 a day as an extra on "Gunga Din": "I didn't 
realize there was that much action in that until I saw the film last night." 
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday afternoon plaque dedication, Rogers recalled making his first 
starring feature, 1938's "Under Western Stars," in Lone Pine. "It was," he 
said, "the most impressive time in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The King of the Cowboys, who will be 79 in November but looks at least a decade 
younger, seemed sincerely touched by the large turnout of fans and old 
movie-making colleagues. He summed up his feelings by singing -- and yodeling 
-- a song he recently wrote for his new album: "I Feel Like I've Grown Up With 
Everybody That's Alive and Kickin' Today." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still alive and kicking today too," Rogers told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
For Western fans, however, the big draw of the festival was a chance to take a 
guided bus tour into the Alabama Hills, a place where movie history has been 
played out at almost every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Between the time silent movie comedian Fatty Arbuckle filmed "The Round Up" in 
1920 to the recent science-fiction thriller "Tremors" with Kevin Bacon, more 
than 200 features and serials -- and dozens of TV Westerns and commercials -- 
have been shot in Lone Pine. 
</P>
<P>
To aid film buffs, special photo markers were set up along Movie Road, a narrow 
dirt road that winds through the area of the Alabama Hills dubbed Movie Flats. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, for example, could look at a production still from "Charge of the Light 
Brigade" and see exactly where Errol Flynn halted his British army patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Or they could see the large boulder that Hopalong Cassidy and his sidekick 
California used to hide from the bad guys in "Silent Conflict" in 1947; three 
years later Gene Autry and Pat Buttram hid behind the same boulder in "Beyond 
the Purple Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Film historian Dave Holland of Granada Hills, who was historical consultant for 
the festival, said the appeal of Lone Pine's Alabama Hills to movie-makers is 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no place in the world like it," said Holland, whose new book, "On 
Location in Lone Pine," chronicles the area's film history. "You have the stark 
desert rocks out there and the snow-capped mountains in the background. You 
can't beat that." 
</P>
<P>
Festival coordinator Kerry Powell came up with the idea to hold a film festival 
in Lone Pine. 
</P>
<P>
As a child growing up in the '30s, Powell recalled, she saw some of the sets 
for "Gunga Din." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember the filming, but I remember seeing elephants up there and how 
exciting it was seeing elephants in our hills," she said. "And I did get to see 
Hopalong Cassidy filming over on the Anchor Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Powell said, she thought that a permanent marker should be erected 
in the Alabama Hills, "so people would realize what happened there. It's really 
a big chunk of Hollywood history." 
</P>
<P>
Orange's Lyden, who has fond memories of working in Lone Pine, is no stranger 
to Western film festivals. He and his wife, Hazel, attend two or three 
different U.S. festivals each year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a shot in the arm for an old boy like me to be remembered," he said 
Saturday while staffing a table in the exhibit hall. 
</P>
<P>
Lyden was selling copies of his four self-published books chronicling his days 
"riding the reel range." He also offered red T-shirts ("Stick 'Em Up!!!") and 
mugs inscribed, "The Movie Bad Man -- Pierce Lyden." 
</P>
<P>
During his heyday playing Western bad guys, Lyden said, people on the street 
would often say, "I know your face, but I don't know your name." 
</P>
<P>
That's changed today, thanks to the film festivals. 
</P>
<P>
"People know my name now," he said, his hands stuck in the pockets of his fancy 
Western pants. "I get fan mail now, which I never did when I worked. Nobody 
ever sends fan mail to the villains." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, people who watched him in the '30s and '40s as kids come up to him 
today and say they would hiss and boo, throw spit wads and fire their cap 
pistols at the screen whenever he and his badmen cronies came on screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy Rogers would beat the devil out of me or something, and that was a big 
laugh for them," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Lyden, who was voted Villain of the Year in a 1944 movie fan poll, retired from 
films in 1962. He spends his time writing free-lance articles about his days 
working in more than 400 films, movie serials and TV shows. And he's thinking 
about writing a fifth volume of his movie memoirs, this time on the serials. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps me busy, and at my age you've gotta do something. You can't sit in 
that rocking chair," he said as a fan approached him for an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Lyden shot another B Western badman grin. 
</P>
<P>
"Howya doin'?" he asked.

BASS-BARITONE HAS ROOTS IN SCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN SHIRLEY-QUIRK, WHO WILL SING AT THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY 'ROYAL GALA' CONCERT, 
DID NOT INITIALLY INTEND TO MAKE MUSIC HIS LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the case of bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, science's loss was music's 
gain. Born in Liverpool in 1931, Shirley-Quirk began his professional career as 
a chemistry teacher, first at a technical college in England and later in the 
British air force. 
</P>
<P>
But all along, friends who heard him sing urged him to try that as a career 
instead, and when composer Benjamin Britten heard him in the early 1960s, he 
picked Shirley-Quirk to create a series of roles in such works as "Curlew 
River," "The Burning Fiery Furnace," "The Prodigal Son" and "Death in Venice." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was a major career born. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley-Quirk, who will be singing at the Pacific Symphony "Royal Gala" concert 
Saturday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, says he's "very glad" of 
his scientific background. 
</P>
<P>
"But sadly," he added between rehearsals at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, 
where he will be singing Rangoni in Mussorgsky's "Boris Godounov" the night 
before he sings in Costa Mesa, "I can't even understand my 8-year-old's science 
anymore. . . . Science has changed, and I have changed." 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that the career shift was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a long time to allow the other side (of the brain) -- I never know 
which side is which -- as free a range as the more scientific side," he said. 
"I approached music in a very much -- I won't say clinical fashion, that can't 
have been the case -- but in a punctilious fashion. And it took me a long time 
before I allowed myself the necessary freedom of expression that must be 
present in music to take its rightful place." 
</P>
<P>
Although he got a late start professionally, music was not new to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Music was always there, all my life," he said. "I can't remember a moment when 
it wasn't there. I started singing at the age of 9 in a church choir. That was 
my basic musical training until I got to the university." 
</P>
<P>
But working with Britten was, he said, the "most stimulating experience of my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"To work with a pair of musicians, Britten and (his long-term companion, tenor 
Peter) Pears together, I think that was my real music school, just absorbing 
their ideas of musicianship and dedication that are necessary to make the work 
a success." 
</P>
<P>
With the Pacific, Shirley-Quirk will sing works by Mozart and Ralph Vaughan 
Williams, and with actress Lynn Redgrave he will narrate William Walton's 
"Facade." 
</P>
<P>
Walton composed "Facade" in 1921 in collaboration with poet Edith Sitwell, as a 
little "entertainment" to be given at one of the soirees held at the home of 
Sitwell's brothers, Osbert and Sacheverell. 
</P>
<P>
The stylish and quirky work, scored for a speaker declaiming Sitwell's 
experimental poems against instrumental accompaniment, survived its hothouse 
origins to become one of Walton's most popular pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never done 'Facade' before," Shirley-Quirk said. "It's a new adventure. 
It's not easy. It's very, very fast and patter-full. . . . I'm moderately used 
to narrating in public, although the balances are totally different when you're 
speaking and when you're singing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sing, you spend more time on a note, and therefore it penetrates an 
orchestral texture better. When you speak, everything is much more staccato and 
short. You have a much greater problem in getting through an orchestral 
texture. The Walton is scored for a fairly small orchestra, which does not 
necessarily mean that it's easy to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes need -- and suspect I will need in Costa Mesa -- amplification for 
the speaking part. But not for the singing parts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of wonderful British music," he added. "Very early on, I got 
associated with that, and I'm happy to have been associated with that, 
particularly with the works of (Benjamin) Britten. But I don't regard myself as 
a British specialist anymore. I think more I would regard myself as a lieder 
specialist, if I had to put a label on myself, which I would hate to have to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley-Quirk allows that English "is very difficult to sing. The problem is 
that first, consonants are relatively soft in English and the vowels are 
diphthongs. So every vowel has to be molded as you go along through a note. 
It's not enough to get onto a vowel and hold it to the last minute, as it would 
be in other languages. You have to guide it constantly, and you have to be 
listening very hard to yourself all the time to make sure what you're producing 
is making English sense and making musical sense. 
</P>

"Sadly, a lot of young singers have gone to Italian coaches or German coaches 
and learned how to sing Italian, learned to sing German or how to sing French. 
Rarely have they gone to anybody to teach them to sing English, assuming that 
just because they are English themselves, that gives them the right to sing it. 
</P>
<P>
"No one would dream of going on stage and speaking Shakespeare without studying 
how to speak English. But there are English singers who go on stage and 
perpetrate all sorts of monstrosities. They have a British passport. But that's 
not good enough, really. It's a subject -- a language, a technique -- that has 
to be studied."

2 SEMIFINALISTS IN CITY SCULPTURE CONTEST WIN TEMPORARY APPROVAL

The Laguna Beach Arts Commission has voted to temporarily approve both 
semifinalists in a City Hall sculpture competition. Spokane, Wash., artist Tom 
Askman and Los Angeles artist Pat Warner, whose proposals were chosen last 
month by a five-person selection committee, will be asked to submit models of 
their proposed designs by Jan. 11, 1991; the arts commission will make a final 
recommendation to the City Council shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Each artist will receive $500 for model fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, 50, proposes a three-tier concrete oval sculpture called "Tenaja" after 
the Spanish name for basins used to collect water in early Southern California. 
The 12-foot-long piece, which would incorporate a shallow pool and a 
trough-shaped fountain element, is meant to symbolize the way public wells were 
used -- as water sources and as meeting places where news and gossip were 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
This would be Warner's first public sculpture commission. Askman, on the other 
hand, has made pieces for several places in a the West, among them a fire 
station in Spokane and a community center in Fremont, Calif. He has also done a 
piece for a Maryland county government office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Askman proposes a fountain sculpture that would be lit at night and that would 
spurt numerous "lively" arcs of water, giving passersby an interactive 
experience. The materials and size of the fountain are to be determined -- 
Askman has not yet seen the City Hall site at Loma Terrace (he unsuccessfully 
petitioned the city for a travel allowance). He usually works in rock, concrete 
and bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Selection committee members were artist and UCI professor Tony DeLap; Charles 
Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum; Tom Rhodes, director of the Santa 
Monica Museum; Maudette Ball, administrator of the Foothill Ranch Urban Arts 
Program in Saddleback Valley, and Laguna Beach Councilman Neil G. Fitzpatrick.

POP BEAT ALTERNATIVE ROCK: IN DISK UNDERGROUND, THESE DEAD CAN DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The CMJ New Music Report's Top 150 album chart is the master scoreboard in the 
world of alternative rock, and the latest list of records making the rounds on 
college radio and in underground circles offers the usual diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar names like John Hiatt and the Pretenders mingle with Cavedogs and 
Strawberry Zots. The music? Punk, folk, progressive, ethnic, art-metal, rap, 
electro-doom-rock and reggae are all represented. Even under this open-door 
policy, it's possible to be surprised. Consider Dead Can Dance, whose artfully 
designed album of ancient folk and church music is one of the hottest items on 
the chart. This edition of Pop Beat focuses on alternative releases from 
independent labels, rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** Andy Prieboy, "... Upon My Wicked Son." Dr. Dream. The Los Angeles singer 
gets caught up in arty-smarty cleverness as he jumps from progressive blues to 
Weill-like theater tune to French cabaret, but at least he's out on the front 
lines grappling with fundamental human matters. He turns Canned Heat's "On the 
Road Again" into a Wagnerian blues with a "Gimme Shelter" edge (Beth Hooker as 
Merry Clayton), and the mock-gospel "Montezuma" portrays the grim consequences 
of faith. But one song dwarfs everything else on the album: "Tomorrow Wendy," a 
cynic's hymn from a doomed soul (a suicidal woman with AIDS). Prieboy pumps the 
emotions of bitterness and lost innocence to operatic proportions, the repeated 
gathering and release of tension creates a compelling dynamic, and guest star 
Johnette Nopalitano (whose band Concrete Blonde does the song on its current 
album) wails her defiance to the heavens. A great piece of record-making. 
</P>
<P>
*** Dead Can Dance, "Aion." 4AD. While progressive pop artists are 
globe-hopping in search of new sounds, the Ireland-based duo of Brendan Perry 
and Lisa Gerrard travels through time for their fifth Dead Can Dance album, 
which offers an assortment of dance, worship and narrative music from the 
Middle Ages. No tricks, no irony, just a touch of personalizing and 
modernizing. While it's rigorous and formal, the tapestry of pipes and booming 
hand drums, tambourines and bells, rich-voiced chorales and Gerrard's warm lead 
vocals draw you into a world of mystery and beauty. Its success is an 
encouraging sign of independence and openness in a market that sometimes seems 
as predictable and orthodox as the music business it's an alternative to. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Jello Biafra with D.O.A., "Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors." 
Alternative Tentacles. Prime-time punk's best on-stage wild man and pioneering 
anti-censorship force teams with the Vancouver punk vets for a crash course in 
current events at thrash tempo. The sound and the themes may be familiar 
(shopping malls, "progress," El Salvador, the CIA, the corporate game, the rock 
game), but Biafra's quavery warble expresses the glee of subversion, and 
D.O.A.'s tough attack gives it freshness. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Teenage Fanclub, "A Catholic Education." Matador. The group is from 
Glasgow, but it sounds like one of the Seattle Sub Pop bands: a thickness of 
churning, chopping guitars conveying adolescent longing and alienation. The raw 
sound is invigorating, and it's a good enough ride for guitar-band fans, but 
the vocals are buried, the songwriting is undeveloped and there aren't enough 
transcendent instrumental performances to compensate.

The homicide rate in Los Angeles rose sharply in the first nine months of the 
year, with 762 slayings reported, 101 more than in the same period of 1989 and 
200 more than in 1988, police records showed today. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics accumulated through September by the Los Angeles Police Department 
also showed increases in the number of rapes, with 1,533 reported, up 4% over 
the same period of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Robberies were up 20%, to 26,634, and aggravated assaults were up 4%, to 
34,280, by Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 73 of the homicides were reported in September alone, 10 of those 
in the gang-plagued South-Central Los Angeles neighborhoods patrolled by the 
department's 77th Division. 
</P>
<P>
The 77th division reported 102 homicides through September, one fewer than a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The overall homicide figure is 15% higher than for the first nine months of 
1989 and 36% higher than for the same time frame in 1988.

FIRE GUTS SANTA ANA TIRE STORE

<TEXT>
<P>
A persistent two-alarm blaze raced through a downtown Santa Ana tire store 
early this morning, injuring five firefighters and causing traffic delays for 
commuters trying to get to offices and businesses near the Civic Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, reported at 4:07 a.m., gutted the B. F. Goodrich store at Bristol and 
1st streets before 35 firefighters could put it out almost four hours later, 
Santa Ana Fire Department Inspector Karl Ellman said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause was under investigation by fire inspectors, who spent the morning 
sifting through debris and hundreds of melted tires, Ellman said. No estimate 
of damage was available. 
</P>
<P>
The melting rubber sent a cloud of thick, acrid black smoke, which could be 
seen for miles, into the morning sky. 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters suffered smoke inhalation, and three others were sent to a 
local hospital when the front facade of the store fell onto them. One of the 
three suffered burns, a neck injury and a broken ankle. The second complained 
of pains in his leg, and the third pulled a back muscle, Ellman said.

ISRAEL PANEL TO INVESTIGATE KILLINGS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: AN EX-SECRET SERVICE CHIEF WILL LEAD THE INQUIRY INTO THE POLICE 
SHOOTINGS OF 19 PALESTINIANS ON THE TEMPLE MOUNT.

<P>
The Israeli government today named a three-member panel led by a former chief 
of the Mossad secret service to investigate the killing of 19 Palestinians on 
the Temple Mount. 
</P>
<P>
The government published a full-page ad in leading dailies today urging 
thousands of Israelis to respond to Monday's violence by showing up at the 
Western Wall for Simhat Torah holiday celebrations Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was ordered by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir before the U.N. 
Security Council began debate on condemning Israel for using police force 
against rioters. The Security Council also was expected to order a U.N. inquiry 
into Monday's blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
"It will now be investigated by ourselves. We don't need a probe by 
international factors," said Yossi Ahimeir, Shamir's spokesman. "The marginal 
point of whether it was excessive force or not is to be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces killed 19 Arabs and wounded 140 in Monday's clash 
outside the Al Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest site. It was the bloodiest 
confrontation of the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli 
occupation, and it raised an immediate world outcry. 
</P>
<P>
The panel was ordered to investigate events leading to the riot and the conduct 
of paramilitary border police in opening fire with live ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what powers the committee would have, Ahimeir said it could make "every 
recommendation they see fit, and the prime minister will decide what to do with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio reported, however, that the committee will not have the power to 
subpoena reluctant witnesses and that its recommendations will not be binding. 
</P>
<P>
Ahimeir said the investigation would be headed by reserve Maj. Gen. Zvi Zamir, 
who headed the Mossad from 1968 to 1974. The other members will be Yaacov 
Neeman, a prominent attorney, and Chaim Kubersky, a former director of the 
Interior Ministry.

The last men-only dining club at Princeton University has voted to stay that 
way despite a state Supreme Court order requiring it to admit female members. 
</P>
<P>
The vote Tuesday by undergraduate members of the Tiger Inn also reverses the 
club's decision earlier this year to admit women and end a 100-year-old 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We all believe the right to freedom of association is an important and 
fundamental aspect of life at any age," said Stockton S. Williams, 
undergraduate president of the Tiger Inn. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Tiger Inn voted to admit women. However, club rules say women 
can be admitted only if undergraduate members vote them in for two consecutive 
school years. 
</P>
<P>
The club said the earlier vote "was taken under severe pressure with pickets, 
bonfires, rallies and other interferences."

Former Mayor Jane Byrne says she will attempt a comeback in 1991 and already is 
circulating nominating petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely having no difficulty getting signatures," she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne was elected mayor in 1979 and lost a reelection bid in the 1983 
Democratic primary to Harold Washington, who went on to become the city's first 
black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
She lost a comeback bid to Washington in the 1987 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard M. Daley, elected in 1989 after Washington died in office, is 
expected to seek a full four-year term in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can run for mayor," Daley said when asked about Byrne's decision.

Defiant Communist officials said today they oppose widespread private property 
and indicated the party will resist calls to give up its own vast holdings and 
share power in a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, briefing reporters on a two-day Central Committee plenum that 
ended Tuesday, also rejected the elimination of party cells in the work place 
and said the Soviet Union will continue to celebrate Revolution Day as a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Ivashko, the party's No. 2 leader after Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said 
private property "will have to be restricted for quite a while" and "it is a 
process of privatization, not a one-time act or decree." And Politburo member 
Alexander Dzasokhov quoted party economists as saying just 7% of all property 
should be transferred to private ownership in the next 10 to 12 years.

Democrats delayed Senate Finance Committee consideration of a deficit-reduction 
plan today after President Bush abruptly backed away from his endorsement of 
higher taxes on the rich to pay for a cut in taxes on capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the apparent reversal of position by the President last evening, we 
will now have to reconsider what the appropriate course of action will be," 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a difficult circumstance for all concerned," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee postponed a morning session scheduled to begin work on a 
plan that was to have included the capital-gains cut long favored by Bush. To 
meet Democratic demands, the plan also included higher income tax rates on the 
wealthy, who would benefit most from the capital-gains reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought until last night that the . . . (Finance Committee plan) would be 
acceptable," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, treading carefully on the tax issue as he campaigned for 
conservative Sen. Jesse Helms in Raleigh, N.C., today promised to work to "put 
together a better package" to match the $500 billion in deficit cuts of his 
rejected plan. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's first test of his professed goodwill toward Republicans who 
disagree with him on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Helms opposed the package Bush crafted with congressional leaders, which was 
rejected last week by the House, calling it "a turkey." He also has criticized 
Bush's decision to abandon his "no new taxes" campaign pledge.

In another sign that the weakening economy is affecting consumer spending, 
glitzy fashion retailer Saks Fifth Avenue said today it is cutting its staff by 
7% to streamline operations. 
</P>
<P>
Saks, which was bought in July by Investcorp International, an Arab financial 
syndicate, said it will eliminate 700 positions. 
</P>
<P>
The upscale store's performance in the first half of the year fell short of its 
own projections, with profits at $26.3 million versus expectations of $32 
million to $33 million, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers have been reporting sluggish sales, and industry analysts are 
predicting that September figures will show no improvement from August. 
Consumers have been pulling back over signs of a recession and higher inflation 
caused by the jump in oil. 
</P>
<P>
Saks said it sees "satisfactory" results for the current year. 
</P>
<P>
Unveiling its growth strategy for the next five years, Saks said it plans to 
invest about $250 million to expand its business. 
</P>
<P>
Saks said its strategy will focus on store renovations, and it plans to 
substantially increase its direct mail business. 
</P>
<P>
Some Saks employees will be given a chance to buy shares in the company. All 
four members of senior management have bought "significant" stakes in Saks, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Saks also plans to expand its resort store operations, test a new specialty 
store concept, and will explore opportunities for growth internationally.

Silver, the Cinderella of the precious metals markets, fell today to a 13-year 
low in early London trading, dragged down by a decline in other precious 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
Silver fell 6 cents to $4.62 an ounce, its lowest since September, 1977, and 
off from Tuesday's close of $4.68. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the drop was caused largely by gold, which weakened with the 
latest surge in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Gold opened in London at $391.55 an ounce, off from the previous close of 
$396.15. Gold has recently tracked oil prices but fell despite oil's sharp rise 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum, also losing its shine, was about $5 an ounce lower at $444.50 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold is in the driving seat but silver is not very attractive to investors 
anyway at present," said an analyst with a large bullion dealing company in 
London. "Silver has been fairly dead in the water . . . it is too industrial a 
metal," he said.

Westinghouse Electric Corp. today reported that earnings in the third quarter 
rose 8.5%, boosted by higher profits in broadcasting and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh-based conglomerate said net income in the three months ended 
Sept. 30 rose to $255 million, or 87 cents a share, from $235 million, or 80 
cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues grew about 1.6% to $3.18 billion from $3.13 billion. But adjusted for 
the divestiture of the transmission and other businesses last year, revenues 
rose about 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales and profits in broadcasting rose substantially primarily because of the 
acquisition late last year of eight radio stations in New York, Philadelphia, 
Los Angeles, Washington, Houston, Minneapolis and other markets. The purchase, 
for an undisclosed price from investment group Metropolitan/Legacy, brought the 
number of radio stations Westinghouse operates to 20.

Psyllium, a cereal grain that is supposed to do wonders for a person's 
cholesterol count, may spark a life-threatening allergic reaction, according to 
a letter to be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Martin J. Kaplan of Highland Park, Ill., said a 43-year-old patient 
developed an allergic reaction shortly after eating Kellogg's "Heartwise" 
cereal, which contains psyllium. Her face, eyes, mouth and tongue swelled, and 
she coughed and vomited before fainting. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a nurse, recovered in a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In a response to the letter, a Kellogg official acknowledged that "there have 
been approximately 50 reported allergic reactions to the product."

Kendall Gill, the Charlotte Hornets' top draft pick, suited up for practice 
today after the team announced that it had signed him to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The signing ends a five-day holdout by the 6-foot-5 guard from Illinois that 
featured a physical confrontation last week between Hornets executive Allan 
Bristow and Gill's agent, Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
Financial terms of the pact were not released, but published reports have 
estimated that Gill's annual pay will be about $2 million in salary and 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner David Stern said no action would be taken against 
Bristow after his apology and offer to pay medical expenses for Tellem 
resulting from Thursday's incident.

John Schuerholz, head of the Kansas City Royals baseball operation for the last 
decade, today was named executive vice president and general manager of the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Schuerholz replaced Bobby Cox, who will remain as the Braves manager. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who had been general manager since 1985, handled the dual job of manager 
and general manager after firing Russ Nixon as manager on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves were 25-40 under Nixon. Under Cox, they were 40-57 and finished at 
65-97 in last place in the NL West, their fourth last-place finish in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals spent millions of dollars last winter to sign free agents Mark Davis 
and Storm Davis, but finished sixth in the American League West with 75-86 
record, 27 1/2 games behind the division champion Oakland Athletics. There had 
been reports Schuerholz would be moved to another position with the Royals.

The San Diego Padres announced a ticket price increase after a losing season 
marred by player infighting and a public relations fiasco caused by Roseanne 
Barr's singing of the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of attending a Padres game was the third-lowest in major-league 
baseball last season and "will continue to be among the lowest in 1991," club 
President Dick Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 ticket price structure, all field, plaza, press and the new View 
Box level seats will be increased $1.50 to $11.00. Loge and regular view level 
seats will be raised the same amount to $9.50, while general admission tickets 
were increased $1 to $5. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Padres fired third-base Coach Sandy Alomar Sr. and picked up the 
1991 contract option of left-hander Atlee Hammaker, who joined San Diego as a 
free agent Aug. 21 after being released by the Giants one week earlier.

Ben Johnson may trade his spikes for showshoes -- yes, snowshoes -- and compete 
for Canada in the 1990 Nordic sprint championships. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Akers, executive director of the Canadian Amateur Snowshoe Assn., said 
Tuesday his group has invited Johnson to compete in the championships in 
Edmonton, Alberta, on Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ben would add a lot of credibility to the sport, because I don't think 
you can find any snow-shoers in the world who would come close to him," Akers 
said. "We expect Johnson to finish in under 12 seconds." 
</P>

American Scott Hannay holds the 100-meter snowshoe record: 15.06 seconds.

Johnson was stripped of the gold medal in the 100 meters in the Seoul Olympics 
after testing positive for anabolic steroids.

Guard Gary Payton, the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft last spring, has 
reached a six-year contract agreement with the Seattle SuperSonics, the team 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came Tuesday night after a meeting between Sonics President 
Bob Whitsitt and Payton's agent, Don DeJardin of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer said in today's editions that the Sonics are 
believed to have raised their initial offer of $1.7 million per season and that 
DeJardin apparently lowered his proposal of $2.67 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
DeJardin wouldn't discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've wanted all along was a fair-market deal," he told the News Tribune 
of Tacoma. "We know as well as anybody Gary belongs in camp. He wants to be 
there and needs to be there. We just have to do what's right." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad this is over," Payton told the News Tribune by telephone Tuesday 
night from his home in Oakland. "I had to learn about it being a business much 
faster than I thought I'd have to." 
</P>
<P>
Payton, a star 6-4 guard from Oregon State, was scheduled to fly to Seattle 
today to sign the contract, Sonics' spokesman Bill Boehlke said. 
</P>
<P>
Payton will be in uniform tonight for a Sonics intrasquad game at their 
training camp in Lacey, near Olympia, Boehlke said. Payton was a holdout when 
the team opened camp last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Payton finished as the all-time leading scorer in Oregon State history with 
2,172 points, averaging 25.7 points as a senior. He finished second on the 
all-time NCAA assist list with 938 and second in steals with 321. 
</P>
<P>
Sonics Coach K. C. Jones had said after drafting Payton that he would be the 
team's starting point guard. But Whitsitt said last week that Payton will have 
to earn the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to come into camp and become the starting point guard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nate McMillan has been the Sonics starting point guard for four seasons. Dana 
Barros, Sedale Threatt and Avery Johnson are other point guards on the roster.

Soviet ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, still dancing at 64, says she'll leave the 
stage forever only when audiences stop responding. 
</P>
<P>
"If I feel I can't give people anything, then I will quit without regret," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Plisetskaya, whose performances in "Swan Lake," "Carmen" and "Don Quixote" were 
benchmarks, recently appeared in Buenos Aires in a ballet by Argentine composer 
Astor Piazzolla. 
</P>
<P>
She began dancing at age 4 and entered the Bolshoi's ballet school at 8. At her 
peak in the 1960s and '70s, her technique was considered flawless, but it was 
her dramatic interpretations that helped her dominate the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Plisetskaya, among a small group of ballerinas who have performed until late in 
life, says age is not as critical in dance as it is in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"In sports if you can't beat the record, that's it," she said.

ACTOR BRAD DOURIF CRAZY ABOUT HIS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Dourif has played so many crazies he's sometimes tempted to doubt his own 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
Dourif's tenure as a nut case dates to the beginning of his movie career 15 
years ago in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," where he played the role of 
Billy Bibbit. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning an Oscar nomination for that portrayal, the slender, red-haired 
actor has appeared in 20 movies, playing a succession of maniacs, weirdos and 
mental cases. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dourif is not dour about his plight. Like most actors, he is convinced 
that lunatics are more fun to play than what passes for normal types. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Dourif was seen as the Gemini Killer, possessed by the devil in 
a priest's body, in "The Exorcist III." 
</P>
<P>
How deranged can you get? 
</P>
<P>
"That's about as far as you can go," a grinning Dourif acknowledged during a 
recent lunch. "But I can't say I think any of this is type-casting. That would 
drive me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Dourif's other roles included a murderous racist cop in "Mississippi Burning" 
and the homicidal doll in "Child's Play." 
</P>
<P>
Making a career of wackos has its rewards. In "The Exorcist III," Dourif spoke 
one of the longest, uninterrupted monologues in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Locked in a prison cell with George C. Scott for the scene, Dourif reeled off 
20 pages of script during the single speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I memorized it in about three weeks," he recalled. "I'd read it through over 
and over for two hours every day. 
</P>
<P>
Dourif took time out from his film career to teach acting at New York's 
Columbia University for a couple of years. But the lure of greasepaint and 
Hollywood greenbacks brought him back to movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm pretty popular with young people," he said, laughing. "They love 
horror films and, believe me, I play some pretty horrible characters."

ACTRESS, 69, PUTS AGEIST IDEAS TO REST

<TEXT>
<P>
Swedish-born Viveca Lindfors is that rare actress who continues to work in 
movies as she approaches her 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps her screen longevity can be attributed to her high cheekbones, an 
arresting contralto, her soaring talent or maybe her Scandinavian genes. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, she is one of the stars of the new movie "Misplaced," playing a 
contemporary Polish expatriate making a home for her family in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
How many other actresses, excepting Lillian Gish and Katharine Hepburn, have 
worked in films for half a century? 
</P>
<P>
She made her movie debut in Sweden in 1941 in "The Crazy Family." Her first 
Hollywood film was "The Adventures of Don Juan" with Errol Flynn in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of the theater and television as well, Lindfors has played a dozen 
nationalities in her 70 films and 50 plays. 
</P>
<P>
Age, she says, should not shorten an actor's professional life. After all, the 
world is filled with people in their 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Of her role as Zofia, the Polish grandmother in "Misplaced," she said: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Misplaced' is unusual because it is a story that includes a major role for a 
woman of my generation. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are films about older people, such as 'Cocoon,' but the focus of 
the film is on a group of individuals in their 70s and 80s. This movie involves 
three generations, including my character's daughters and a grandson," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm going to make a boring comment. We see older men in movies quite 
frequently. But it seems that women are not allowed to grow old in Hollywood. 
</P>

"There is a whole slew of really wonderful male character actors, but not so 
many character actresses. That's because men run the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear that there are millions of women who would like to see 
characters on the screen with whom they can identify, women their age who are 
not stereotyped," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is necessary for women of my generation to write and produce some 
motion pictures themselves." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Lindfors wrote, produced and directed "Unfinished Business," a 
short movie for the American Film Institute. She also co-produced film versions 
of "The Jewish Wife" and "The Stronger." 
</P>
<P>
"Older women can be sexually exciting," she said. "In 'Unfinished Business,' I 
wrote love scenes and a shot in which I run around naked. I have an incredible 
scene in a Jacuzzi with myself and a young girl with whom my character's 
husband is having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
"The older woman gets her husband back."

Amy Irving wasn't sure she wanted to return to the stage less than five months 
after giving birth, but the producers made her a deal she couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial instinct was to say, 'No, I want to stay home with the ba" said the 
actress during break from Wendy Wasserstein's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, "The 
Heidi Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke, she cradled 4 1/2-month-old Gabriel, her son with Brazilian 
director Bruno Barreto. Barreto directed Irving's recent film "Show of Force." 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Theater, which is presenting "The Heidi Chronicles," arranged for 
a nursery next to Irving's dressing room and found rehearsal space near the 
home of her mother, actress Priscilla Pointer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they slated rehearsals around the kindergarten schedule of 
Irving's 5-year-old son, Max, from her marriage to Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
The production runs through Dec. 23 at the UCLA James A. Doolittle Theater in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Irving plays the character Heidi Holland during the years 1965-1989. Heidi is 
an art historian and feminist who finds her beliefs challenged by the changing 
times.
