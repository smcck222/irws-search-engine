USAIR FINED $1,000 FOR LATE TAKEOFF; 
</P>
<P>
AIRPORT: REPRIMAND FOR CURFEW VIOLATION AT LINDBERGH FIELD IS MORE THAN JUST A 
SLAP ON THE WRIST, THE PORT DISTRICT EMPHASIZES. 
</P>

<P>
The director of the San Diego Unified Port District levied a $1,000 fine 
against USAir on Tuesday for "willfully violating" a curfew aimed at giving 
residents near Lindbergh Field relief from the roar of late-night and 
early-morning flights. 
</P>
<P>
USAir, which last year took over the San Diego-based operations of Pacific 
Southwest Airlines, becomes the first airline reprimanded by the Port District 
since stiff anti-noise regulations were enacted in April. 
</P>
<P>
The 11:30 p.m.-6:30 a.m. curfew has been in effect since 1976, but the Board of 
Port Commissioners only voted at the meeting in April to invoke "civil 
penalties" against any airline that, in Port Director Don Nay's words, "broke 
the rules." 
</P>
<P>
For those who might scoff at the size of the fine, Dan Wilkins, a spokesman for 
the Port District, said: "The issue is not the money, but compliance of 
regulations. The board adopted these rules and is making sure the airlines 
comply." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Violation, $3,000 Fine 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said a second violation in one three-month period would bring a fine of 
$3,000, and a third violation would warrant a $5,000 penalty followed by a 
review of the airline's "privilege" to operate at Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"We're serious about that," Wilkins said. "We will, at that point, very 
seriously review the airline's entire operation at Lindbergh Field. These 
airlines have to realize that flying into and out of San Diego is not a right, 
it's a privilege that we allow." 
</P>
<P>
Sid McSwain, a resident of South Mission Hills, who, until recently, served on 
the port's noise advisory committee, called Tuesday's fine "a minor victory" 
for homeowners bothered by the comings and goings of flights at Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to hear it," McSwain said. "Apparently, the airline did it with 
full knowledge that a violation was being committed. They blatantly ignored the 
rules, so I'm pleased that the Port -- finally -- is getting tough. I'd say 
it's about time." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Pickett, a spokesman for USAir, said last week that on the day the 
violation occurred -- Aug. 4 -- the company had just merged with Piedmont 
Airlines and was trying to integrate a "difficult" new schedule of flights. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that USAir Flight 620 left San Diego at 11:57 p.m. -- 27 minutes 
after the curfew -- bound for Pittsburgh. As a way of illustrating the delays 
caused by the merger with Piedmont, Pickett said the flight was scheduled to 
leave at 10:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He added that such restrictions are not new to USAir, that, indeed, many of the 
airports it uses in California carry penalties for curfew violations. He said 
that the San Diego penalty was the first the airline had incurred. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Pickett was unavailable for comment. Agnes Huff, a spokeswoman for 
the airline, said: "We have no comment -- none. We won't get into it." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said that Nay received a letter from USAir on Friday, "not contesting 
the violation" but "not offering a reason," either, for why it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the facts before us, we considered it a willful violation," Wilkins 
said. "Shortly after the new regulations took effect, a few airlines had 
departures that left a few minutes late, and we wrote them strong letters. The 
word got out very quickly that we meant business. We don't want to beat the 
drum too hard, but we do want the rules obeyed." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Board of Port Commissioners supplemented the curfew by restricting 
the type of aircraft used between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Only the quieter Stage 3 
aircraft, such as the Boeing 737-300, are allowed to take off or land during 
those hours. The USAir flight guilty of the curfew violation was a Stage 3 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Go Elsewhere' 
</P>
<P>
At the 1987 meeting of the Board of Port Commissioners, Alan B. Wayne, a 
spokesman for United Airlines, predicted that airlines would "turn away from 
San Diego in increasing numbers" if noise restrictions continue. Wayne said the 
"phenomenal growth (of San Diego) will make no difference. We'll have to go 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another chink in the national air transportation system," he 
added. "We were backed in our opposition to this by the U.S. Postal Service, 
the (San Diego) Chamber of Commerce and the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. 
This considerably narrows San Diego's attractiveness as an aviation market." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about airline concerns, and whether Tuesday's fine was a victory for 
anti-noise forces in the continuing furor over the airport, Wilkins said: "It 
isn't a matter of winning or losing, and you'll have to ask the airlines about 
their intentions. We have rules, and it's our job to enforce them. It's as 
simple as that."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEGAL SEMINAR TO HELP ALIENS WITH HIV VIRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Downtown Legalization Project in Los Angeles is conducting a training 
seminar for attorneys and immigration advisers on how to prepare an HIV waiver, 
which is needed by some immigrants to become U.S residents under the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service's Amnesty Program. 
</P>
<P>
The waiver is a 30- to 50-page document in which applicants who have tested 
positive for the human immunodeficiency virus may explain why they should not 
be denied legal status. HIV causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Reform and Control Act states that amnesty applicants testing 
positive for specific infectious diseases -- including AIDS -- are subject to 
automatic denial, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who test positive for HIV have been exposed to AIDS but may not 
have contracted the disease. 
</P>
<P>
J. Craig Fong, an attorney at the Legalization Project, said the waiver allows 
those who test positive to have their cases reviewed further, rather than 
automatically denied. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 10%, or 30,000, amnesty applicants are likely to test positive 
for the virus, a Legalization Project spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The training session will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday at the office 
of public counsel, 3535 W. 6th St. For information call 747-4097.

SEWAGE CAPACITY PUTS POWAY HOMES ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poway City Council members voted unanimously Tuesday night to impose a year's 
moratorium on all residential and public construction projects, citing the lack 
of sewage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Bowersox said all sewage capacity in these categories has 
been committed to approved projects or to projects with completed applications. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium will not affect the city's South Poway industrial development, 
where capacity still exists. 
</P>
<P>
Bowersox said that additional capacity is not available from the city of San 
Diego and the metropolitan sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
No opposition was voiced at Tuesday's session, the first of two to be held 
before the moratorium takes effect Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong moratorium on residential, public and semi-public construction 
projects could be lifted early if San Diego allots more of its sewage capacity 
to Poway or Poway reallocates its existing capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Residential projects already approved by the city will not be affected, city 
officials said, but new residential projects will be put on hold until the city 
receives more sewage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Poway imposed a similar building moratorium in March, 1987, but lifted it seven 
months later when San Diego approved an increase in the city's capacity from 4 
million gallons a day to 5 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
The additional capacity was rationed according to a system approved by the 
Poway City Council. City Manager Jim Bowersox said last week that the city 
would have run out of capacity by Nov. 1 if the moratorium had not been 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial and industrial projects in the city will not be affected by the 
moratorium because sewage capacity is available for those uses, Assistant City 
Planner James Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
Poway is planning to build a waste-water reclamation plant to reduce the waste 
going into the metropolitan system, allowing resumption of residential building 
when sewage capacity becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Streeter, assistant city planning director, said the plant, to be built 
near Interstate 15 south of Poway Road, will not be operating for at least four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Poway officials plan to seek more capacity from San Diego and 
to initiate several studies aimed at freeing up permits for residential and 
public projects, Streeter said.

Now that the first Bay Area World Series is assured, San Francisco Mayor Art 
Agnos has raised hackles in Oakland by saying he may forego the traditional 
series wager between rival mayors. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in Oakland that I want," he quipped after the Giants beat the 
Chicago Cubs to advance to the series to play against the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
But in his gush of civic pride -- Oaklanders might call it snobbery -- Agnos 
may be passing up one of the season's better bets, one that contributed much to 
the festivity of last year's victory celebration for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
When the underdog Dodgers beat the Athletics last fall in five games, Oakland 
paid off with 30 gallons of a coveted export, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream. The 
windfall -- in six flavors -- fueled a City Hall party that went all afternoon, 
recalled Lydia Shayne, a press aide to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Guests numbered in the hundreds, from every city department and political 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland wasted no time," Shayne said. "They called us and said, 'When do you 
want the ice cream?' and it was here. It was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers here are not exactly laying out the interplanetary welcome mats, no 
matter what the Soviet press is saying. 
</P>
<P>
The once-conversative news agency Tass on Monday contained reports of aliens as 
tall as 13 feet landing near Moscow. The creatures, characterized by tiny, 
knob-like heads, were said to have descended from a disk-shaped saucer in a 
city about 300 miles from the Russian capital, whereupon the visitors took a 
brief walk through a park before disappearing again, according to the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
But Ed Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory, said the news was 
immediately considered suspicious. For one thing, no Russian scientists came 
forward with samples of the strange mineral reportedly left behind by the 
saucer. Not only that, but descriptions of the creatures just didn't ring true. 
</P>
<P>
"You would hope that anyone traveling hundreds of light-years through space to 
get to Earth would have a little more than a tiny bump for a head," Krupp said. 
"Their brains must be in their feet." 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled employees of Unocal, Wells Fargo Bank and four other major downtown 
corporations got a chance for revenge Tuesday as the chairmen and chief 
executive officers of those firms took part in a "dunk tank" to benefit United 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
The event, kicking off United Way's 1989-90 fund-raising campaign, featured an 
apparatus that dunks its victim as soon as a thrown ball strikes a target. Top 
officials from Security Pacific National Bank, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Johnson 
&amp; Higgins and Pacific Telesis Group were among those taking a cold bath. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a wet and wild campaign. . . ," said Unocal's Richard 
Stegemeier, chairman of the $30-million drive, after being dunked by one of his 
own underlings. How did he feel about it? 
</P>
<P>
"Wet." 
</P>
<P>
Not long agoJ. Michon watched a frustrated woman throw a tantrum at a DMV 
office, yelling and waving papers, merely because she had waited in line for 
four hours. Now Michon and two partners have a company catering to just such 
impatience. 
</P>
<P>
The name is nothing exciting -- the DMV Registration &amp; Filing Service, 
based in West L.A. -- but the promise is perhaps exhilaration: You'll never 
have to wait in a Department of Motor Vehicles line again. 
</P>
<P>
Michon and his partners will do that for you, for fees ranging from $10 to $35. 
Best of all, they don't charge by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age, with hectic hours and people working, it's very 
difficult" for most people to make time for DMV appointments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he reports, clients seem grateful. Take the guy who signed up a few 
days ago. He had waited in a DMV line for half a hour and got nowhere. "He 
counted 44 people in front of him," Michon said. "In half an hour they moved 
three people. He left. You can't really blame him."

SON CONVICTED OF KILLING ACTRESS MOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PREDMEDITATION, TIMOTHY SCOTT ROMAN 
WAS FOUND GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, NOT MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A judge on Tuesday convicted Timothy Scott Roman of involuntary manslaughter in 
the 1986 bludgeoning death of his mother, actress Susan Cabot, famed for her 
roles in B-movies and her romance with Jordan's King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
However, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp declined to find 
Roman guilty of murder. She said there is no evidence that Roman premeditated 
bludgeoning Cabot to death with a barbell in the Encino home they shared. 
Premeditation would have been required to prove murder. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the defendant loved his mother very much," said 
Schempp, who presided over Roman's six-day, non-jury trial. Cabot, 59, was 
found dead across her bed in a blood-soaked nightgown on the night of Dec. 10, 
1986. She had been clubbed repeatedly on the head. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was delivered just 10 minutes after closing arguments, which lasted 
less than an hour. One of Roman's two attorneys ushered him out of the 
courtroom through a rear exit immediately afterward. His grandmother said she 
and Roman are "just overjoyed at the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, what we have gone through. Timothy and I are just drained," said Elizabeth 
Roman, who sat through her grandson's trial. "It's time to start a whole new 
life. We are taking him away from this area, this town." 
</P>
<P>
Roman, a 25-year-old former art student, could receive a maximum sentence of 
four years and a minimum sentence of probation. Since he has already spent 
about 2 1/2 years in jail, he could conceivably have enough credits for good 
behavior and jail work to have fulfilled his sentence, officials said. Schempp 
scheduled sentencing for Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an extremely tough call for the judge to have to make," said the 
prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Stone originally was seeking a murder conviction but asked Schempp in closing 
arguments to convict Cabot of voluntary manslaughter, an unlawful killing 
without malice but with intent to kill. Stone said he decided to seek 
conviction on the lesser offense late last week after hearing the defense case 
and deciding Roman did not act with premeditation. 
</P>
<P>
Richard P. Lasting and Michael V. White, Roman's attorneys, did not dispute 
that Roman killed his mother. However, they asked Schempp to acquit Roman or 
find him guilty only of involuntary manslaughter, which is unlawful killing 
without malice or intent. They contended that Cabot provoked the killing with 
aggressive, irrational behavior and that Roman's actions were caused by 
hormones and drugs he took because he did not have a pituitary gland. 
</P>
<P>
Born a dwarf, Roman's growth to his present height of 5 feet, 4 inches was 
induced with thrice-weekly injections of a hormone derived from the pituitary 
glands of cadavers. A former attorney once called him "a failed human 
experiment." The attorney claimed the experimental treatments caused aberrant 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Schempp said she was swayed by testimony that Cabot was deeply depressed, 
suicidal and suffering from increasing mental deterioration in the days before 
her death. 
</P>
<P>
Schempp particularly cited the testimony of Cabot's longtime psychologist that 
his 50-minute sessions with the actress were so emotionally draining that he 
felt sorry for Roman, whom he surmised constantly lived with Cabot's fears. 
</P>
<P>
Schempp also noted her shock at a videotape showing the slovenly, unkempt 
condition of Cabot's Encino house. The tape and testimony showed the house to 
be littered with newspapers that were three to four years old and spoiled food. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beyond my imagination that a person of such success and notoriety at 
one time could live in such indescribable conditions," Schempp said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Roman testified that his mother seemed not to recognize him 
and was screaming, talking to herself and calling for her mother on the night 
of the killing. When Roman tried to call paramedics, he testified, his mother 
attacked him with a weight bar and scalpel. 
</P>
<P>
Roman said he later found Cabot dead but does not remember killing her. He 
admitted lying to police, telling them a burglar in a Ninja mask had killed his 
mother, and said he hid the barbell and scalpel because he didn't think anyone 
would believe his story. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, who has been free since June on $25,000 bail and living with his 
grandmother in Los Angeles, had faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Schempp granted Roman a mistrial about a month into the proceedings 
after his attorney, Chester Leo Smith, was admitted to a hospital with what 
were said to be stress-related heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Had he not bowed out, Roman's family had vowed to fire the attorney for, among 
other things, revealing to jurors that Roman had confessed to police that he 
killed his mother. The information otherwise would have been excluded from the 
jury since Roman had asked to have a lawyer present before confessing.

EMBEZZLER GETS 30-DAY TERM, FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court judge rejected a prosecutor's plea for a more 
stringent sentence Tuesday and ordered an insurance broker to spend 30 days in 
County Jail for embezzling clients' insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Malcolm Mackey also ordered Gary Martin, 53, of Tujunga to perform 300 
hours of community service, imposed a $10,000 fine, ordered him to pay 
restitution to his victims and avoid working in a capacity in which he would be 
responsible for other people's money. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Martin, president of Welmar Insurance Service, Sept. 18 of six 
felony charges for stealing about $23,000 from three clients who had paid him 
to buy auto insurance policies. The clients were left without insurance 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen had urged that Martin be sentenced to two 
years in prison, but Mackey said the community would be better served if Martin 
worked and paid restitution. 
</P>
<P>
"Sending everyone to jail is not a panacea," Mackey said. "The punishment must 
fit the crime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failing Business 
</P>
<P>
Mackey described Martin, who used the money to pay the operating expenses of 
his ailing insurance company, as a small businessman who got in financial 
trouble and did not deserve to be punished as if he had set up a business 
deliberately to defraud people. 
</P>
<P>
But Ipsen said Martin, whose broker's license previously had been suspended for 
six months for misusing funds, got off too lightly. The prosecutor said the 
sentence reflects the court system's leniency toward white-collar criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"If they appear to be 'one of us' -- white, Anglo-Saxon, educated people -- it 
becomes difficult to send them to state prison," Ipsen said. "If it were 
someone not wearing a tie and not wearing a jacket who had stolen similar 
dollar amounts and shown a similar lack of remorse, there is no way he would 
have gotten probation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Criminal Record 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles County Probation Department agreed with the judge's 
assessment. It had recommended that Martin not be sentenced to state prison, 
noting that he has no criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
After his conviction, Martin told a county probation officer that he was 
innocent. He said the theft was planned by his former partner, Clark Wells, who 
pleaded guilty to two charges of theft in 1987 and was sentenced to three years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was arrested in June, 1987, after a San Fernando businessman tried to 
add a car to an insurance policy that Martin had been paid to buy. The 
insurance company notified the businessman that the policy had been canceled 
for non-payment.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH IS NEVER FAR FROM THE MIND OF A 
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY WORKER.

Asign is posted prominently inside the musty shed at the Caltrans yard in 
Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
"Please Don't Smoke," it reads, taking up the oft-heard anti-smoking cry of 
modern American life, "We'd rather die of natural causes." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of death is never far from the mind of a California highway 
worker these days. Forty-five have been killed since 1972, 24 by errant 
motorists, making their job more potentially lethal than that of California 
Highway Patrol officers, 40 of whom have been killed in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Last Dec. 12, 36-year-old Henry Mendoza, who had worked in the Newhall office, 
was killed while setting up highway cones between the Glendale and Foothill 
freeways in Glendale. A car drove through the cones and hit a Caltrans trailer, 
which hit Mendoza. More than 150 of Mendoza's colleagues, dressed in their 
distinctive orange vests, attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good worker," recalled Roger Moody, a Newhall supervisor and 
Mendoza's close friend. But Mendoza, in his opinion, made a mistake by going to 
work setting out the cones before the heavy equipment arrived, which would have 
been parked in front of the workers to protect them. "They didn't wait for 
backup," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, Moody and his 10-man crew were confronting a job that 
would have been rough, grueling work on a normal construction site: replacing a 
10-foot-square, 10-inch-thick slab of concrete that looked like it could hold 
back the Colorado River. But this slab was lying in the right-hand lane of 
Interstate 5, a wide expanse of highway amid open canyons that encourages 
reckless speed. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, mustachioed, 50 years old and regarded by colleagues as "hard but fair," 
had been watching cracks grow in the slab for months. Now, as the big 
semitrailers roared deafeningly by, accelerating as they descended Weldon Grade 
west of Newhall, the slab vibrated like a tuning fork. 
</P>
<P>
Each "closure" is different, but this job was particularly dangerous because 
Moody had decided to close two of the lanes. Additionally, since the highway at 
this point began to twist around a curve in the canyon, the work site on the 
right was not easily visible from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing safety, Moody ordered workers to begin setting up the bright orange 
warning cones a quarter of a mile behind the work site, on the other side of 
the hill. Electronic message boards warning drivers to move over were moved 
into position and dump trucks and other heavy equipment were parked in front of 
the workers. Moody was making sure that if a car burst through the cones, as 
had occurred in Mendoza's case, they would have to smash their way through tons 
of metal to get to his men. 
</P>
<P>
But even when all this was done, there were problems. Cars and trucks could be 
heard slamming on their brakes and locking up their tires up the road from the 
workers. "Nobody wants to give way," Moody groused. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds of highway alarm caused Eric Foster to glance up anxiously. He knew 
how fast trouble could find a person. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, on U.S. 101 near Studio City, a car had driven through the 
cones, clipped the heavy Caltrans equipment and spun out of control. It hurtled 
past, within three feet of where Foster was standing. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do, it happened so fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, a 29-year-old North Hollywood man who wears rakish sunglasses and a 
blond beard, doesn't look like the kind of person who would scare easily, yet 
he was shaken. The driver was embarrassed. "He was afraid to come over" after 
the accident, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
But a few miscreants regard highway workers as colorful targets. Objects have 
been thrown at Foster and once he was shot at. The bullet missed. 
</P>
<P>
"You do wonder if there's a better job somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moody was so frustrated by the failure of the cars and trucks to heed the 
warnings to move over that he took a chance and walked over to where the 
traffic rushed by like a turbulent river. Using his arms as though he were a 
kind of street mime pretending to throw some heavy object into the line of 
traffic, he began waving the cars over by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he weren't being reckless, Moody said later, "I had to be where they 
could see me. I was ready to run." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he decided the closure was as safe as he could make it, and the work 
began in earnest. A man borrowed from the Lebec Caltrans office ran the 
"hoe-ram," a piece of equipment with a drill attached to the front for boring 
through the thick cement. 
</P>
<P>
After the slab was broken, Foster climbed into a loader and tried to scoop out 
the rest. Workers with thick steel pikes attacked boulder-sized pieces of 
cement that refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
The loader finally burrowed its way through the concrete and revealed the cause 
of the slab failure: small pools of water. A drainage system was installed when 
the lane was built back in the '70s, Moody said. It had apparently failed, 
however, allowing water to build up and cause dirt under the slab to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the piercing wail of a semi's horn snapped everyone to attention. A 
big truck bore down on the rear bumper of a car that had waited until the last 
moment before moving to the left. The man in the car hunched over the wheel as 
though he were closing in on the checkered flag at Indianapolis. The crew 
watched in fascination as the two vehicles sped by in a perilous pas de deux, 
yet miraculously avoided an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said his wife still worries that he might be killed on the job. But he 
said the $29,000 he makes each year "puts food on the table." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he shrugged, "the insurance is good."

<P>
A Chatsworth man who broke into his ex-girlfriend's Burbank apartment Tuesday 
after she refused to let him in was shot and wounded in self-defense by a 
friend of the woman, the Burbank Police Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Nichols, 20, fled the apartment after he was shot about 1 p.m. but was 
arrested by police who stopped his car a few blocks away, Sgt. Don Goldberg 
said. Nichols was in good condition at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center jail ward, where he was being held on suspicion of burglary, Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols had gone to visit Leslie Jackson, 19, at her apartment in the 1600 
block of Grismer Avenue and broke through a window after she refused to let him 
in, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Bailey, 26, of Dallas, Texas, shot Nichols once in the right leg after 
Nichols allegedly struck Jackson and threatened to kill her, Goldberg said. 
Bailey acted in self-defense and was not arrested, Goldberg said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new fourth lane eastbound on the Ventura Freeway in Woodland Hills will be 
restriped tonight and opened to traffic at 6 a.m. Thursday, state Department of 
Transportation officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
The new fourth lane westbound will be opened to traffic early Saturday morning, 
said Jim McAllister, resident engineer of the $22-million widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a temporary local bypass route, aimed at encouraging motorists bound for 
Warner Center to leave the freeway in Calabasas, will be closed at 10 tonight 
as no longer needed because of the extra traffic capacity of the renovated 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
McAllister said the westbound off-ramp at Parkway Calabasas and the eastbound 
off-ramp at Valley Circle Drive will remain closed until Oct. 21.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DESCANSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were still searching Tuesday for an inmate who fled the 
medium-security Descanso County Jail when an alarm system malfunctioned, a 
department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Kelly, who was awaiting transfer to the El Cajon jail because he was 
caught with a jail-made knife, escaped about 6:30 p.m. Monday, spokesman Lewis 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly reportedly squeezed between a fence and the roof of a temporary holding 
area, Jones said. Kelly, who had been left unattended, was discovered missing 
when deputies made a 7:30 p.m. check. 
</P>
<P>
An alarm system designed to detect motion along the fence failed to sound when 
Kelly made his escape, Jones said. According to Jones, the system is checked 
twice a day and was in working condition before the escape. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly was serving time for narcotics violations, Jones said.

About 12,000 gallons of sewage spilled into San Diego Bay on Tuesday when rocks 
and debris blocked a sewer main, causing sewage to overflow a manhole on 
Georgia Street near the Imperial Beach-San Diego boundary. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 a.m. spill continued for two hours, according to the county Department 
of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage flowed into a storm drain and emptied into the southern tip of San 
Diego Bay. About 200 feet of shore was contaminated, and the area has been 
posted as hazardous while water samples are taken.

TEACHING EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the issue of evolution being the only "scientific" view presented in 
California science textbooks ("Textbook Panel Bolsters Stand on Teaching 
Evolution," Part I, Sept. 29), most of the heat in the argument is generated by 
the secularists refusal to acknowledge that science is neither conducted nor 
taught in a philosophical/ideological vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
Honest creationists and evolutionists both recognize that their basic 
philosophical/ideological views will color their conclusions. For instance, all 
of man's experience to date has shown that design demands a designer. To the 
creationist, this is perhaps the most profound evidence for the existence of 
God and his supernatural work in the origin of all things. Because the secular 
evolutionist presupposes that natural things can have only natural causes, he 
concludes that design in the universe must have come about by chance. 
</P>
<P>
Those conclusions are at the heart of this whole controversy. There are 
thousands of "facts" or observations that appear to support both positions. 
</P>
<P>
All that the honest, Bible-believing Christian has ever wanted is fairness in 
the teaching of evolution. Since evolution is the only position secular 
humanism can take regarding origins, it is obvious that evolution will be 
taught. I believe that it is only just that all the facts be presented, 
including those that create serious doubt about many of the arguments for 
evolution. To deny that right to teachers only proves that the state is taking 
an unscientific and dogmatic position.

HEALTH-CARE CATASTROPHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the victim, there is little choice between cruelty that is deliberate and 
cruelty that results from common political callousness. Last year's attempt to 
shelter older Americans from the financial panic often created by a long 
illness is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the program dealt with the most common medical crisis among the 
elderly, the long-term confinement to a nursing home that can devour the most 
carefully assembled nest egg. But it did extend coverage for longer-term 
hospital stays, promised relief from major doctor and drug bills and was better 
than what Medicare offered at the time. We supported it as a good first step 
toward something even better. 
</P>
<P>
It is now clear that the Medicare Catastrophic Insurance Act was doomed from 
the start by two factors. It was conceived as a political gesture, not a 
medical program. And former President Reagan insisted that the elderly pay the 
entire cost of insurance to cover bills for long-term illness rather than 
having the burden shared with the nation's working population. That led to a 
revolt of "haves" against "have-nots," stirred up by a mail campaign that 
strayed occasionally from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign or no, 5% of the people for whom Social Security is only one source of 
their income were to pay an income surtax that could have reached $800 each 
this year. That was necessary to make the plan work for the 60% of pensioners 
whose incomes were so low that they paid only pennies a day. On top of that, 
the 5% with relatively high incomes usually had private pension plans to 
support them through long illnesses and did not need any help from Medicare. It 
doesn't take being wealthy to balk at a financial proposal that gives you 
nothing for something, but Congress did not have to cave in as fast as it did 
to pressure from the more affluent and vocal pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted last week to repeal the catastrophic act 
entirely. In today's Washington, it seems appropriate that the senator who got 
a bill through his chamber that stripped out many benefits but did not actually 
kill the act is something of a hero. The odds are that the House will prevail 
over the Senate and that Congress, which in consort with President Bush gave 33 
million older Americans less in the way of protection than they needed, will 
snatch even that much away from them. Because Congress cannot stop long-term 
illness, costs will be met in other ways with higher private insurance 
premiums, from savings and from state programs for the elderly poor. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) voted against the act in the first 
place because "it covered the wrong catastrophic needs" and cost so much that 
Congress would never extend it to nursing homes. Beilenson would go back to 
square one and design a new and balanced federal health program. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal should be a national health plan that would cover the 
important needs of the elderly, extend medical coverage to some 38 million 
Americans who now pay their own bills or get along without either doctors or 
hospitals, and sharply curtail the cost of health care that now approaches 12% 
of the gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to Washington of expanding health care along those lines is estimated 
at between$50 billion and $70 billion a year. Congress has some, but not much, 
time to find ways to pay for it. Otherwise, it will have to sit by while its 
plan for a catastrophic health-care program disintegrates into a health-care 
catastrophe.

AGOURA HILLS RECALL SUPPORTER SAYS COUNCILMAN HELPED DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pepperdine University professor who was active in a failed attempt to recall 
four Agoura Hills City Council members charged Tuesday that the fifth member of 
the council actively supported the recall drive while publicly saying he was 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jack W. Koenig helped plot their strategy during a meeting with 
recall proponents in March, according to a legal declaration filed Tuesday by 
former recall activist Paul Sheldon Foote. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig responded that he "rejected his allegations against my colleagues" 
during the recall struggle earlier this year, "just as I reject his allegations 
against me now." 
</P>
<P>
The recall effort targeted Mayor Darlene McBane, Mayor Pro Tem Vicky Leary and 
council members Fran Pavley and Louise C. Rishoff, but not Koenig. Shortly 
after the recall campaign began in late 1988, Koenig said publicly that "there 
is no reason to believe" he would not support the four if the recall campaign 
garnered enough petition signatures to force a special election. 
</P>
<P>
But last May, the recall effort fell short of the required 2,237 signatures, 
gathering only 1,934. 
</P>
<P>
Rishoff filed suit in connection with the campaign, charging she was libeled by 
two recall proponents who accused the four council members of conspiring to 
violate the Brown Act, a state law requiring official decisions to be made in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Foote made his accusations against Koenig in a sworn statement filed in Van 
Nuys Superior Court Tuesday as part of Rishoff's suit against Carole Dynda and 
David Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
The charges that Koenig was involved in the recall inject the first controversy 
into the Agoura Hills City Council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig is seeking reelection Nov. 7, as are McBane and Fran Pavley. In 1985, 
the three ran together on a slow-growth slate. But in the past two years, 
Koenig has distanced himself from the other four council members. 
</P>
<P>
McBane and Pavley said Tuesday that they had not planned to run with Koenig 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure I will work to defeat him, but I will not support him," Pavley 
said. "The recall, in our seven-year history, was probably one of the most 
divisive and destructive things that happened to us."

CONTROVERSIAL BILLBOARDS TO COME DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM PLANNING PROJECTS NEAR AGOURA HILLS TO FORCE REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A company that wants to build two major projects near Agoura Hills is 
terminating the leases of four billboards just outside the city, forcing the 
removal of the signs by the end of the year, a representative of the firm said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of billboards along the Ventura Freeway has been a major issue for 
the town's City Council. Agoura Hills officials are seeking a "scenic highway" 
designation for the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The company, Potomac Investment Associates, is proposing to build 94 estate 
homes and nearly 1 million square feet of commercial space on 474 acres north 
of the freeway and just east of the city's boundary at Chesebro Road. 
</P>
<P>
Peter N. Kyros Jr., Potomac's general counsel, said the termination of the 
billboard leases was not related to the company's discussions with the city 
about having it annex the land from Los Angeles County and approving the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Valuable' 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is the billboards are unsightly, and removing the billboards is more 
valuable than the income they produce," Kyros said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not we annex to Agoura Hills, we're right next to Agoura Hills and 
expect to be good neighbors, and we don't think the billboards on the property 
enhance the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members reacted happily to news of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's wonderful," Mayor Darlene McBane said. "Four fewer billboards 
will certainly improve the scenic quality of the area." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to second-guess his motives," Councilwoman Fran Pavley said, 
"but regardless of whether his project gains approval, whether it's through the 
city or Los Angeles County, the billboards will be gone, and we do appreciate 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Potomac acquired the land in 1988 from Encino realtor Jerry Y. Oren. The 
company also has proposed a controversial 2,300-acre project at Jordan Ranch in 
Ventura County, just north of Agoura Hills. Ventura County officials have yet 
to decide on that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The four billboards were making several thousand dollars a month in rent, Kyros 
said. He would not be more specific. The leases were held by 3M National 
Advertising Co., which will have to remove the billboards by Jan. 1, Kyros 
said. A 3M official could not be reached for comment.

On Dec. 15, trustees of North Orange County Community College District will be 
selecting a permanent chancellor who will oversee the Fullerton and Cypress 
College campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the surrounding communities of those two colleges are 
populated overwhelmingly by Latinos, trustees should consider someone who will 
reflect that population. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Bill 1725 mandates that school districts with a high percentage of 
minority students also have on its faculty, staff and administrative personnel 
reflecting that population. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees would be sending a hopeful message to Latino constituents 
by select-ing Latinos to lead the college district. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the trustees would avoid more lawsuits from civil rights 
organizations namely, Los Amigos of Orange County, Mexican American Legal 
Defense Fund, League of United Latin Americans, GI Forum and many others.

DAY LABORERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Drug pushers roam our school campuses. Gang members murder children. People 
unwilling to work accost us on the street. And the Costa Mesa police spend time 
arresting men, day laborers ("Intent Clause Fuels Dispute on Day Labor Law," 
Part I, Oct. 3), whose crime is the desire to do an honest day's work. Where 
are their priorities?

TEACHING EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I cannot believe that as we are about to enter the 21st Century, the state 
curriculum commission is still debating whether the historical and observable 
fact of biological evolution should be taught in biology classes in public 
schools! 
</P>
<P>
If the believers in a magical universe are able to legislate the creation myths 
into biology classes, what is to prevent future equal treatment of astrology in 
high school astronomy classes or the equal treatment of every imaginative form 
of metaphysical speculation into physics classes? 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the State Board of Education will not allow the rewriters of 
natural history to force their myths on the schools.

3-YEAR-OLD BOY SAVES MOTHER BY DIALING 911 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Rodgers had no idea that the ambulance that passed him as he stood 
outside a newsstand Tuesday was headed for his Van Nuys condominium, where his 
wife was choking and on the verge of passing out. 
</P>
<P>
But his 3-year-old son, Jameson, had known exactly what was happening and just 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson picked up a phone and called 911, just as his parents had trained him. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's on the floor. She can't breathe," he told a Los Angeles City Fire 
Department dispatcher in a calm and articulate voice. "She can't breathe. She 
can't talk." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, three paramedics arrived from a station only a third of a mile 
away and found Peggy Rodgers on her hands and knees in a back room of the 
condominium, gasping for air. After two tries, they managed to dislodge a 
lozenge stuck in her throat, authorities said. She did not need to be 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson's parents said they taught him how to call 911 about a year and a half 
ago when his mother was in the midst of a difficult pregnancy. They placed the 
phone within easy reach and had him practice making the call with the phone 
line unhooked, said Michael Rodgers -- son of country-pop singer Jimmie S. 
Rodgers -- who returned home to find his wife safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize he had called 911 till I heard sirens," the mother said at a 
news conference that Fire Department officials called to honor the boy. "He 
kept saying, 'It's OK, mom. They're on their way. They're on their way.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a hero," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials agreed, saying Jameson's training, quick thinking and 
tenacity saved his mother's life after she choked on a lozenge as she watched 
television with the boy and his three-month-old sister, Michele, at about 1:45 
p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was unable to breathe for at least three minutes, about two to 
three minutes less than the maximum amount of time before lack of oxygen causes 
brain damage, said Fire Capt. John Biggs, one of the rescuing firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The mother said she had taken the lozenge to fight a sore throat that kept her 
home from work. She said a medicinal spray numbed her throat, causing the 
lozenge to become stuck. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought for the whole time that I would die. I thought, 'I'm not 
breathing.' I never thought I wouldn't see my kids again." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the phone conversation, the mother got on another phone and 
gasped the words "I'm choking, I'm choking," said Robert Sanchez, the Fire 
Department dispatcher who took the call. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson, who will be 4 on Friday, said that although he sounded calm on the 
phone, he was frightened for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"When the paramedics were fixing her, I grabbed my teddy bear and I told 
myself, 'Don't bring my mom away like the ambulance does. Don't take her away.' 
"

GROWTH SPILLS OFF THE MAPS; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE, SANTA CLARITA VALLEYS A MAZE IN EMERGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, in their rapid transformation from 
rural outposts to suburbia, have become such a hodgepodge of unmapped streets 
and invisible addresses that firefighters and sheriff's deputies fear they will 
be unable to find the sites of emergencies, a report to the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors responded by ordering formation of a committee to study the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The board, voting on a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, directed public 
works officials to organize a group of county employees and community 
representatives to study the problem and report back with possible solutions in 
90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich was absent from Tuesday's meeting, but said in his motion that 
emergency vehicles are having an increasingly difficult time responding to 
calls in foothill communities, where many roads are private and do not appear 
on official county maps. 
</P>
<P>
He said some new homes are given addresses on streets that have yet to be 
built, a problem that is compounded by a lack of street signs and the fact that 
many addresses are not visible from roads. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, fire and law enforcement officials said they could cite no 
specific instances in which citizens suffered because of difficulties finding a 
home, but they are aware of the problem and fear it is growing worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on an inspection in Acton last week," said county fire inspector Tom 
Little, who is based in Lancaster. "It took me half an hour to find the house, 
and I've lived up here since 1962. I knew about where it was at. I had a Thomas 
Guide in front of me, and I still had a hard time finding it. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a fire, you'd see smoke and go to that," Little said. "But if 
someone has a heart attack, and there are no visible signs of a problem, how 
would you know where to go?" 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Terry Hart, based at County Fire Station 80 in Acton, said a house in his 
area had an address on Hubbard Road, but actually fronted on Hughes Canyon, 
more than half a mile away. "I'd bet you we've got 100 houses in this area not 
fronting on the street where they have an address," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Deputy Mike Grimes said his substation, which serves 
almost 1,500 square miles, does not receive maps of new areas from local cities 
and the county in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not up to date because of all the new tracts going in," he said, 
adding that deputies responding to calls sometimes have difficulty finding 
their destination. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said some old homes in the area are set back from the road. New 
houses are built in front, and both use the same street in their address, 
although the older house no longer fronts the street. A house might have an 
address indicating that it is on a north-south street, when actually it is on a 
portion of a winding road that runs east and west. 
</P>
<P>
"It's creating all kinds of confusion," said Antonovich's deputy, Dave Vanatta. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the area is experiencing problems, however. Chief Mike Balzano, 
whose station covers the unincorporated territory in the Santa Clarita Valley, 
said one of his subordinates is assigned full-time to updating the station's 
maps. "We feel comfortable that we know where everything is," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: DESPITE A SEASON OF SPILLS, THRILL REMAINS FROM THIS SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' season was a bust, but it couldn't erase the memories of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
One of those memories will endure among sports fans everywhere. Kirk Gibson's 
pinch home run off Oakland's Dennis Eckersley to win Game 1 of the 1988 World 
Series was the greatest sports thrill of the '80s, according to Sport magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top 10: 
</P>
<P>
2. Doug Flutie's Hail Mary touchdown pass to Gerald Phelan with no time left on 
the clock, giving Boston College a 47-45 victory over the University of Miami 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
3. Dwight Clark's leaping catch of a Joe Montana pass in the back of the end 
zone, giving the San Francisco 49ers a 28-27 victory over the Dallas Cowboys 
and the 1981 National Football Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
4. Keith Smart's baseline jump shot with five seconds to play, which gave 
Indiana the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
5. Marvelous Marvin Hagler's knockout of Thomas Hearns in the third round, 
ending the fight now known as "Eight Minutes of Hell." 
</P>
<P>
6. Bob Tway's sand shot on the 18th hole to beat Greg Norman in the 1986 PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
7. Lorenzo Charles' dunk that gave North Carolina State the 1983 NCAA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
8. Rookie Magic Johnson's move to center in place of the injured Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals, when Johnson scored 42 points 
and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead the Lakers to the title. 
</P>
<P>
9. Pete Rose's single off Eric Show that moved Rose past Ty Cobb on the 
all-time hit list. 
</P>
<P>
10. The collision of Cal's Kevin Moen with a trombone player in the Stanford 
band as Moen crossed the goal line to complete a five-lateral, game-winning 
kickoff return as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Angels' Johnny Ray played in 134 games this season, so there 
now are only two players in the major leagues to play in 150 or more games each 
of the last eight years. Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
The Fitchburg State watch: Morning Briefing incorrectly reported that the 
Falcons had the weekend off. Sadly, it was not to be; they suffered their 36th 
consecutive loss, 10-0, to Massachusetts Maritime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It could happen here: Toronto residents are rightfully proud of their new 
SkyDome and their city's squeaky-clean image. But it's tough for any big city 
to be perfect. Lewis H. Diuguid of the Washington Post quotes John Crispo of 
the University of Toronto's business school: "The city fathers are close to 
worshipping growth for growth's sake. We've destroyed our waterfront. . . . 
We're not on the verge of being one of those dreadful American cities, but I am 
worried." 
</P>
<P>
Sabre-rattled: Arizona State punter Brad Williams, quoted by the Mesa Tribune's 
Mark Emmons on his playing days at Oklahoma under then-Coach Barry Switzer: "I 
saw some stuff that you wouldn't believe that even the papers didn't have. 
There were linebackers beating up backup quarterbacks. One day I came out of my 
room and saw a guy going down the hall waving a sabre and slicing chunks out of 
doors. And stuff like that was minor." 
</P>
<P>
Gumming the works: The Toronto Blue Jays' Lee Mazzilli keeps a Bazooka Joe 
comic inside the sweatband of his cap. It says: 
</P>
<P>
Teacher: "Where are you from?" 
</P>
<P>
Joe: "Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
Teacher: "Oh yeah. What part?" 
</P>
<P>
Joe: "All of me." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Baltimore Orioles' Cal Ripken and the Atlanta Braves' Dale 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Danny Cox, sidelined for the entire 
season because of elbow surgery, said he will build a mound on his property in 
Freeburg, Ill. Asked if he would pitch to his wife, Nancy, during the 
off-season, Cox said: "I don't want to be a widower." GARR KLUENDER

SOVIET PRIAKIN SCORES AS FLAMES BEAT DEVILS WITH 4-GOAL PERIOD

<TEXT>
<P>
Sergei Priakin scored one of Calgary's four second-period goals as the Flames 
beat the New Jersey Devils, 4-2, Tuesday night in the first meeting between 
Soviet players on opposing National Hockey League teams. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mullen started Calgary's streak with a goal 26 seconds into the period off 
a pass from Doug Gilmour on a two-on-one breakaway. Mullen's 15-foot shot tied 
the score at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
After Dana Murzyn scored at 3:45, Priakin gave the defending Stanley Cup 
champions a 3-1 lead at 6:27 of the period when he scored his first NHL goal. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Roberts closed the second-period scoring for the Penguins (3-0), with a 
20-foot shot with 9:50 left. New Jersey dropped to 1-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, Winnipeg 1 -- The Penguins overcame the third consecutive 
goal-less game by NHL scoring champion Mario Lemieux to win at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
John Cullen and Bob Errey had goals in the first period and former Winnipeg 
defenseman Jim Kyte scored twice as the Penguins improved to 1-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Kyte and Randy Gilhen, traded from the Jets in a six-player deal last June, 
combined for three goals. Winnipeg dropped to 1-2.

NORTHRIDGE POSTS FIRST CCAA WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team won its first California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. volleyball match of the season Tuesday, defeating Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, 15-12, 15-7, 15-6, at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (11-8, 1-2 in CCAA play) is ranked fifth in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn.'s Division II. Junior outside hitter Marianne Dixon led a 
balanced CSUN attack with seven kills. Keira Middleton and Patty Fitzsimmons 
each added six kills. 
</P>
<P>
Senior setter Karen Sutherland led Dominguez Hills (6-10, 0-2) with six kills. 
</P>

RADIO DAYS IN SANTA CLARITA FORCE DELAYS IN THE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Been standing around at a Canyon High football game lately? Found yourself with 
some extra time during a timeout at a Hart game at College of the Canyons? 
</P>
<P>
That's probably because you're smack in the middle of a radio timeout. That's 
right, KBET (1220 AM), a Canyon Country-based station that broadcasts selected 
games involving Canyon, Hart and Saugus, has arranged for two breaks in the 
action each quarter in order to accommodate local advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
The results are similar to Sunday games in the Coliseum: Players standing 
around on the field waiting for a play to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have the permission of both coaches (for a timeout)," said Mike 
Levine, KBET program director. "If not, it's just catch as catch can. We try 
and signal for a radio timeout at the eight- and four-minute marks and whenever 
there is a score. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no complaints from any coaches. We try to repay them by giving them 
tapes of the games." 
</P>
<P>
Game change: Montclair Prep's Alpha League opener against Marshall Fundamental 
has been re-scheduled, Coach George Giannini said. The game will be played 
Thursday night at 7:30 at La Canada High. It was originally scheduled for 
Saturday night at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
A revolutionary player: It seems that Aaronn Castro, believed to be the first 
freshman to play on the varsity at Cleveland, looks a little old for his age. 
</P>
<P>
"We call him the man-child," Cleveland Coach Steve Landress said. "He's more 
mature than most of these guys. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in with a full beard over the summer. He looked like Che Guevara." 
</P>
<P>
Add Cleveland: Maybe senior running back Pat Bryant is lobbying for his old 
job. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 14-7 win over Chatsworth, Bryant was utilized on occasion at 
flanker; playing that position in 1988 he caught a team-high 20 passes for six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Against Chatsworth, Bryant caught three passes for 46 yards and scored the 
game-winning touchdown on a 30-yard pass from quarterback Steve Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
A class act: Camarillo High cross-country runners Chad Malesich, Abe Valdez and 
Derek Kite tied for first in the Scorpions' Marmonte League tri-meet victory 
over Channel Islands and Royal last week, but it was Kite who opted to be the 
third-place finisher of record. 
</P>
<P>
When a runner completes a race, he is given a stick indicating his place. The 
first-, second- and third-place sticks were handed to Kite when he, Malesich 
and Valdez simultaneously crossed the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, a senior transfer from Agoura, selected the third-place stick and handed 
the Nos. 1 and 2 sticks to Malesich and Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to stop being so polite," Coach Mike Smith said facetiously. 
</P>
<P>
No revenge: When the Thousand Oaks girls' volleyball team advanced to the 
playoff round at the San Marcos Invitational on Saturday, the Lancers met a 
familiar opponent. Across the net was Gahr, which defeated Thousand Oaks in the 
Southern Section 4-A Division final last year in three game, a loss not easily 
forgotten by seven Lancer seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year later, the Lancers had no better luck, losing, 15-6, to the 
Gladiators, who played with more emotion than the Lancers, according to 
Thousand Oaks Coach Ron Beick. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ranked No. 1 this year and Gahr is No. 8," Beick said of last week's 
poll. "That might be why they played more emotionally than us." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks finished 10th and Gahr in the 25-team tournament, which included 
five nationally ranked teams and was called the best girls' high school 
tournament field of the season by Volleyball Monthly. Thousand Oaks has been 
ranked 13th in the nation by Volleyball Monthly.

No hits, no outs. Following a week of prime-time programming dominated by 
baseball playoffs on NBC, the scorecard on the new TV season Tuesday showed 
neither smash hits nor immediate cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
NBC beat ABC by less than one rating point, 15.2 to 14.4, to win the third week 
of the official season last week, according to figures from the A.C. Nielsen 
Co. CBS trailed with an average weekly rating of 12.5. But NBC's 68-week 
winning streak will face a severe challenge when ABC begins airing the World 
Series Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
With post-season baseball games playing havoc with the regular television 
schedule, network executives said that it is too early to make definitive 
statements about where the season is headed. Patterns, however, are clearly 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
While NBC should have no trouble retaining its prime-time ratings crown, ABC 
appears likely to begin closing the gap. CBS has some medium-range successes 
among its new series but is facing unexpected problems from some veteran shows. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly haven't solved all our problems," Arnold Becker, CBS' vice 
president of TV research, said Tuesday. " 'Island Son,' 'Major Dad' and 'Rescue 
911' are the most heartwarming among the new CBS series -- things we might brag 
about, if you will." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, CBS already is facing significant problems on Fridays, even 
though NBC has not unveiled two of its three new shows on that night. CBS' new 
"Snoops" is not faring well at 8 p.m., the veteran soap "Dallas" is dropping 
below expectations at 9, and so is "Falcon Crest" at 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Friday night was not supposed to be a problem," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' new "Major Dad," which leads off Monday night at 8, appears to be the 
closest thing to a bona fide hit among the 24 new series on the four networks. 
The Gerald McRaney sitcom ranks 20th in the season-to-date averages. ABC's 
"Chicken Soup" outranks it at No. 11, but industry observers say the numbers 
for Jackie Mason's comedy are deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
While "Chicken Soup" is getting the kind of ratings that network programmers 
usually dream about, it's actually performing poorly in its particular time 
slot. The sitcom is preceded by "Roseanne," the most popular show on TV. While 
the mega-hit provides a huge carryover audience for "Chicken Soup," the number 
is dwindling each week. Last week, about 8 million of the 25.6 million 
households watching "Roseanne" turned to something other than "Chicken Soup" 
when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, 'Chicken Soup' is disappointing in terms of the falloff," Alan 
Wurtzel, ABC's senior vice president of marketing and research, observed 
Tuesday. "But it would be premature to come to any conclusions. I think the 
jury's still out on 'Chicken Soup.' " 
</P>
<P>
At NBC, executives are still waiting for "Hardball" and "Mancuso, FBI" to debut 
in their regular Friday slots and for "L.A. Law," "Hunter" and "In the Heat of 
the Night" to start their new seasons. Preston Beckman, NBC's vice president of 
audience research, said that the network's strength so far appears to be in its 
returning shows, many of which are performing at higher levels this year than 
last. 
</P>
<P>
But the network is not without letdowns. " 'Sister Kate' doesn't appear to be 
developing an audience," Beckman said. He considered it too early to tell 
whether "The Nutt House" will find viewers. 
</P>
<P>
While the combined network share of the audience is up three points over the 
first three weeks of last season, there is debate among TV executives whether 
those figures hold any signifcance. Network erosion -- the loss of viewers to 
cable, independent stations and VCRs -- has been a great concern to the 
networks. An increase in the audience share would normally be a good sign. But 
because of the writers' strike last year, there was little new programming 
available, making comparisons inappropriate, some executives say.

Verdi, Puccini or Wagner weren't on the bill when the Cleveland Opera opened 
its season Tuesday night. Unfolding on stage was "Holy Blood and Crescent 
Moon," an opera written by Stewart Copeland, 37, former drummer for the rock 
group The Police. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland, who spent six years with the Police before going on to score movies 
and television shows and write music for a San Francisco Ballet production, 
doesn't put himself in the same league as the masters, but does use arias, 
choruses, grandiose sets and other traditional opera trappings. His opera is a 
love story of a prince and the daughter of a Palestinian ruler who help each 
other despite the wars their people wage. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland's father headed the Middle East office of the CIA and he grew up in 
the region. The opera took four years to write and came about when he was urged 
to make good on a flip remark in 1984 that he might write another ballet "after 
I finish my opera." ALEENE MacMINN

Rock musician David Crosby is launching a new career on the lecture circuit. 
After a speaking appearance before 300 students at the University of Maryland, 
Crosby said he's testing these new waters "because I'm a very opinionated guy 
and I love communicating with other people." Jan Dance, his wife and partner in 
a downward spiral of drug addiction and like Crosby a recovering addict, 
offered another reason. "As a musician for many years he gave the impression 
that it was OK to do drugs. He understands now that he made a mistake and set a 
wrong example and now he's trying to set another example," she said. Dance said 
Crosby hopes his message will help others in trouble with drugs. "He does it 
from the heart, to help anyone listening understand it's a path they don't have 
to travel." ALEENE MacMINN

Hold the organ music: Friday the 13th has apparently exacted its curse on 
Valentina Vitale and Anthony Nunzio, the title characters of "Tony n' Tina's 
Wedding." The producers of the environmental theater piece that recreates an 
Italian-American wedding celebration have canceled this Friday's press 
performance. The reason: anticipated noise interference from a Rip magazine 
party-concert (featuring Faster Pussycat, Wolfsbane, Phantom Blue, Love Hate, 
Johnny Krash, Mimes) that will be going on in a room directly above at the Park 
Plaza Hotel where the mock wedding is staged. ALEENE MacMINN

'DAYTRIPS' LIGHTENS THE DARKNESS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Seen any good comedies about Alzheimer's disease lately? 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things you realize in the course of this kind of degenerative 
(process) is that either you develop a sense of humor and a sense of patience 
-- or you don't cope," said Steven Kent, director of Jo Carson's "Daytrips" (at 
the Los Angeles Theatre Center). 
</P>
<P>
The play focuses on three generations of a contemporary Tennessee family: 
grandmother, mother and daughter (whose character doubles as the narrator). The 
mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't recognize her caretaker-daughter, Pat. The 
grandmother refuses to acknowledge her daughter's illness -- and has deluded 
herself into thinking that Pat is her other, now-dead daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this is tremendously undermining for the care-giver," said Kent, 
48. "She has no identity from her mother or her grandmother -- and the two of 
them are constantly arguing about who she is." The title refers to the trio's 
"daytrips" on a succession of shopping expeditions -- "variously scary and 
funny and sad." 
</P>
<P>
The laughter, Kent added, is often that of surprised recognition. "The 
playwright says that comedy is dangerous -- because when you're being funny, 
you can deal with things that nobody wants to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to deal with it," he said of the specter of aging parents. "And 
this is biographical for Jo -- she was the daughter. She also was in on the 
whole rehearsal process, and sometimes it was very difficult for her to watch 
-- because as it gets deeper, it gets closer. I mean, it's a very brave thing 
she's doing. Both of these women are still alive, in institutions; it all 
happened in the last 10 years. So it's very fresh." 
</P>
<P>
For Kent, too. "Right now, I'm dealing with that," he said slowly. "My mother 
does not have Alzheimer's, but she's very ill. She's not eating." He paused. 
"Of course, my sister in Denver is doing the major caretaking. But I have the 
daily need to check in on her. And it certainly brings an urgency to the work; 
it's not being done in the abstract. I know how powerful these issues are." 
</P>
<P>
Kent and Carson are also old friends, members of Regional Organization of 
Theatre South (ROOTS), where "Daytrips" received its first staged reading. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when we all knew what a piece it was, because of the audience response 
-- big belly laughs with tears running down their faces," he said. "A woman's 
piece? Yes, in that it's certainly the three ages of woman: young, middle-aged 
and crone. But I think women in this society are the caretakers. Women 
understand that duty more than men do . . . lamentably." 
</P>
<P>
Although he made his name more than 20 years ago in Los Angeles theater -- as 
one of the founding members of the Company and ProVisional theater companies -- 
Kent has been relatively absent from local stages recently. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the longest period I've spent at home in Los Angeles in five 
years," he said with a shrug. "I go where the good projects are. I've been 
working a lot with Tennessee Repertory Theatre in Nashville -- a regional 
theater where I direct things like 'Hamlet,' 'Evita,' 'Death of a Salesman' and 
'West Side Story.' I'm also an associate director of a group in Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
Why the South? "My mother's maiden name is Crockett (as in Davey), and a lot of 
my people are from Tennessee. I have a strong feeling about that section of the 
country -- and about how the rest of the country has an oddly pejorative 
attitude toward Southerners. Hey, the South is fabulous. There's a real 
renaissance down there." He's not as sure when it comes to assessing his own 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I don't have a heavy vibe," he said with a chuckle. "I'm not scary. A 
lot of people in my profession are scary; sometimes people do theater by 
intimidation. I take theater so seriously, I can't be grim about it. I love it 
too much. And I love the people. I have this mission -- I know it's odd to talk 
about missions -- about theater from the heart, theater with a social 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that far from where he started out. "I was going to be a minister," 
Kent said. "Growing up in Deadwood, S.C., I loved music and visual arts and 
literature and congregations of people and social action. In a small town, the 
only forum I could find was the church." 
</P>
<P>
Enrolling at USC to study architecture, Kent was quickly corralled by a drama 
professor into building a set. "Suddenly, there was a place for all my 
interests. There was ritual, philosophy, communities of people working 
together. And it's such a gregarious art form. I didn't have to decide if I 
wanted to be an artist or a musician or a poet -- because it was all there." 
</P>
<P>
(Kent will return to USC this fall, to guest-direct Ted Hughes' "shocking" 
version of Seneca's "Oedipus.") 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he and a group of like-minded students formed the Company 
Theatre; under Kent's direction, it became known as one of the most progressive 
and innovative theatrical influences of the '60s. But in 1972, Kent and others 
splintered off into a new group. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who wanted to work collectively with works of intensely social 
nature became the Pro-Visional," he said. That group lasted till 1982. "We were 
all tired. I also think a lot of people in the ProVisional were doing theater 
not because they loved theater, but for political reasons -- a way of achieving 
a kind of social progress. I, on the other hand, love theater. Theater is 
absolutely relevant to me." 
</P>
<P>
Still. "I never seem to change," Kent noted. "I was very fortunate to find 
something (25 years ago) that I still love. I like the stuff of it, in the way 
that potters love clay and people who play instruments love their instruments. 
I like being in a hot, dark room with a Styrofoam cup of coffee, a piece of 
paper and actors in this big space -- and out of our communal stuff, make 
something that wasn't there, share that experience with other people."

STAGE WIRE: LONDON LIKES LEMMON, NOT 'VETERANS DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has Jack Lemmon been up to lately? He's been in London, doing a play at 
the Theatre Royal, Haymarket -- Donald Freed's "Veterans Day." The critics 
liked him, mostly hated it. 
</P>
<P>
Lemmon plays a gung-ho used-car salesman and World War II vet who uncovers a 
presidential-assassination plot in the local veterans' hospital. Involved are a 
Vietnam War hero (Michael Gambon) and a mute World War II veteran in a 
wheelchair (Robert Flemyng). 
</P>
<P>
Most of the critics found Lemmon's superpatriot salesman a true 
characterization, not just a spin on Lemmon's good-guy persona. Nicholas Jongh 
of the Guardian: 
</P>
<P>
"The character is most unattractive and Lemmon refuses to sentimentalize the 
man or to temper his unlovely characteristics. (Later) the glibness goes and 
Lemmon shows the man changing, succumbing to childlike fear and disgust. Lemmon 
has not quite the pitch of fervor or intensity for the high emotional, but it 
is a performance of virtuoso finesse and compulsion." 
</P>
<P>
But De Jongh found Freed's script both flimsy and ponderous, its anti-war 
message old news and its plot faintly preposterous. Other critics tended to 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative papers were particularly hard on the play, previously 
performed at the Denver Theatre Center. The Sunday Telegraph's John Gross 
called it "a bad joke of a play" and the Daily Mail's Jack Tinker said that its 
only sign of genius was its ability to corral Lemmon into the cast. 
</P>
<P>
But critics disposed to accept the play's argument also were disappointed. 
Michael Billington in the International Herald-Tribune: "At a time when so much 
American drama is obsessed with domestic crises, it is tempting to raise a 
cheer for a writer who believes that politics is the stuff of theater. The 
problem is that Freed's liberal instincts outpace his dramaturgical gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Didn't anyone have anything good to say about "Veterans Day"? Yes. Michael 
Ratcliffe of the Observer: "It is much more original and less soppy than 'A 
Walk in the Woods' and the players complemented one another superbly." 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Actress Frances Sternhagen, in Backstage magazine, on the 
different requirements of screen and stage acting: "You have to project it on 
the stage, and you have to contain it in films."

LONDON BAROQUE IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chamber Music in Historic Sites matched genuine Baroque musical style with a 
campy, mock-Baroque interior for the opening of the Nakamichi Brillante series 
Monday evening. The site: the Second City Theater (ex Mayfair) in Santa Monica. 
The players: London Baroque, an 11-year-old ensemble featuring some recent 
personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
The exuberant performances fit the gaudy showcase -- its hospitable acoustic 
compromised by an insistent buzz from the ceiling lights -- with an informal, 
almost improvised feeling. The sense of convivial camaraderie -- and the length 
of the concert -- were extended in a gracious and game but misplaced effort to 
serve everyone coffee and dessert during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The musical goodies were presented with thorough respect, understanding and 
affection for period practices -- original instruments, very low pitch, 
ornamental elan, etc. Such attention to detail is no rarity these days for 
historically oriented groups, but the bracing vitality, conversational approach 
and sheer recreative joy of the playing is. 
</P>
<P>
Violinists Hiro Kurosaki and Richard Gwilt, cellist Charles Medlam and 
harpsichordist Lars Mortensen played trio sonatas by Corelli, Handel and Bach 
as if the music had just been composed. Ideas were discovered and exchanged 
seemingly spontaneously, in elastic tempos and pertinent phrasing. Balances and 
textures were clear, and technique secure. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosaki, a flamboyant fiddler and one of the newer members of the group, had 
the engaging solo duties in an animal sound extravaganza by Biber, the Sonata 
Representativa Avium. Mortensen, also new, gave an almost indolent, then 
explosively speedy account of Bach's Prelude, Fugue and Allegro, while ensemble 
leader Medlam proved eloquent although occasionally technically troubled in a 
sonata by Vivaldi. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosaki and Gwilt completed the printed program with the dazzling interplay of 
an unaccompanied duet by Leclair. For their encore, the quartet turned to what 
Medlam characterized as modern music -- a Church Sonata in D by Mozart.JOHN

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: THOSE DENIED AMNESTY ARE URGED TO APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that only a tiny fraction of eligible immigrants have appealed 
government denials of their amnesty applications, representatives of the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor's immigration project Tuesday urged 
applicants not to give up too easily and offered to help file their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe many eligible applicants fail to appeal their denials because of 
lack of affordable legal services and lack of information about the appeal 
process," said Teresa Sanchez, director of the federation's Labor Immigrant 
Assistance Project. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics show that appeals have been 
filed by only about 8% of the more than 37,000 applicants denied amnesty so far 
under the first stage of the government's massive amnesty program, Sanchez 
said. She blamed the low appeal rate on the INS, saying that the agency "has 
done little or no publicity" to alert applicants of their opportunity to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 of the 1.1 million applications for temporary residency in the 
Los Angeles INS district have been approved. Those rejected now face the 
prospect of reverting to illegal alien status.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL BACKS WATER RATE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee on Tuesday endorsed a water rate increase 
that will raise the average customer's bill by 5.9%, despite a report from city 
analysts that the increase is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Georgeson, a Department of Water and Power assistant manager, said the 
increase is needed to generate $12 million for the remainder of the current 
fiscal year and $19 million next year, a revenue increase of at least 6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The rate hike is intended to pay for a variety of new projects, rehabilitate 
aging DWP facilities and pay for the increased cost of water from Mono Lake and 
the Owens Valley, as well as offsetting standing debts, Georgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the city administrative office said in a report that "the 
financial condition of the water system would remain sound without a rate 
increase this year."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3-YEAR OLD CALLS 911, SAVES CHOKING MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When his mother began choking on a lozenge in their Van Nuys condominium 
Tuesday, 3-year-old Jameson Rodgers knew exactly what to do. He called 911, 
just as his parents had trained him. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's on the floor. She can't breathe," he told a Los Angeles Fire 
Department dispatcher in a calm and articulate voice. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, three paramedics arrived from a station only a third of a mile 
away and found Peggy Rodgers on her hands and knees, on the verge of becoming 
unconscious. They dislodged the lozenge stuck in her throat, authorities said. 
She did not need to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson's parents said they taught him how to call 911 about a year and a half 
ago when the mother was in the midst of a difficult pregnancy. They placed the 
phone within easy reach and had him practice making the call with the phone 
line unhooked, said his father, Michael Rodgers -- son of country-pop singer 
Jimmie S. Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize he had called 911 till I heard sirens," the mother told a 
news conference that fire officials called to honor the boy. "He kept saying, 
'It's OK, mom. They're on their way, they're on their way.' "

FALSE FRONT PAGE WRAPPED AROUND TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,500 copies of Tuesday's Times were wrapped with a fake front page 
criticizing U.S. involvement in El Salvador and the newspaper's coverage of 
events there. 
</P>
<P>
The crudely fashioned pages appeared in newspaper racks from Santa Monica to 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman claiming to represent an unnamed group responsible for the bogus 
front pages told United Press International that The Times was targeted because 
its El Salvador coverage "is biased." 
</P>
<P>
"We did this so the general population of L.A. can really know what is going on 
down there," the spokesman said. "This will happen again and again until 
coverage becomes less biased and more full." 
</P>
<P>
Times Editor Shelby Coffey III deplored the action. "We feel the perpetrators' 
view of our coverage is erroneous," Coffey said. "They are perfectly free to 
have their opinions, but they are wrong in vandalizing our news racks and 
misappropriating our name to express those opinions." 
</P>
<P>
The mock front page featured a masthead that read "Los Angels Times" and a 
Times-style typeface. It contained stories about the civilian death toll in El 
Salvador and the amount of U.S. tax money spent there. There was also a false 
apology from The Times for its news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of the page contained a denunciation of Salvadoran right-wing 
leader Roberto D'Aubuisson and an ad for an upcoming demonstration against U.S. 
intervention in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran peace activists have also placed phony front pages on newspapers in 
Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Phoenix, Baltimore, Tucson and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Al Brewer, The Times' circulation street sales manager, said most of the phony 
pages were placed in vending machines in the Westside, although they were also 
found in North Hollywood, Studio City, Los Feliz and in South-Central and 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of readers reported sighting the phony pages. Some recognized the prank 
copies immediately. "It looks exactly like your front page, only darker," said 
Margaret Charnoff of Los Feliz, who bought her copy on Hillhurst Avenue. George 
Charouhas of Studio City said he was also momentarily fooled. "It took me a few 
seconds to realize that The Times looks funny," Charouhas said. 
</P>
<P>
Other readers were confused by the fake page. "What is this, a joke or 
something?" asked one woman who lives in Santa Monica. And a caller who 
purchased his copy of The Times in Westwood advised: "I think you should know 
that there's a Third World-oriented hate parody in your paper today." 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen for two of the city's major Salvadoran relief organizations said 
they were unaware of the prank. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Grabowski of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, 
one of the sponsors of Saturday's Salvadoran rally, said she had not seen the 
phony page. Mary Brent Wurley, an official with the Interfaith Task Force on 
Central America, expressed surprise over the bogus page, then applauded the 
stunt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's fabulous," Wurley said. "We don't know anything about it, but we're 
very impressed with it. That's so exciting."

SLAIN LAWYER FACED CHARGES OF BILKING FIRM AND CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY and EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles criminal defense attorney killed in his office was facing 
allegations of embezzling money from a former law firm and misappropriating 
clients' fees, court records showed Tuesday, but investigators said they are 
unsure if there is any connection between the accusations and the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Arnold Richardson, 34, was gunned down about 12:15 p.m. Monday in the 
lobby of his office at 5455 Wilshire Blvd. -- only nine days before he was to 
stand trial for allegedly embezzling nearly $4,000 from the Jacoby &amp; Meyers 
law firm, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department Detective Dan Andrews said police believe that a 
disgruntled client may be involved in the slaying, but added: "There may have 
been other reasons. A disgruntled client is what (police) are looking at. 
There's nothing connecting (the allegations) to the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, an arrest warrant issued April 22, 1987, alleged 
that Richardson stole $3,900 from Jacoby &amp; Meyers, the national law firm 
where he worked from June, 1985, until he was fired a year later. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1985, court documents show, a woman named Adrienne Robbins paid 
Richardson in cash and checks to represent her in a lawsuit against an auto 
dealership. Instead of depositing the money in the firm's accounts, Richardson 
pocketed the money, Jacoby &amp; Meyers officials alleged in the documents. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview Tuesday, Leonard Jacoby, a senior partner in the firm, 
described Richardson as "a good lawyer, very charming, very bright. . . . He 
just wasn't honest." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the embezzlement indictment, documents show, the State Bar had 
accused Richardson of three instances of financial impropriety and of failing 
to cooperate with a Bar investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson had not responded to the charges and, consequently, was on the verge 
of being declared in default, according to State Bar records. 
</P>
<P>
State Bar documents show that a woman gave Richardson a $725 check in August, 
1987, to prepare a property settlement agreement in a divorce case. He cashed 
the check without depositing the money in a bank, but he never prepared the 
papers, it was alleged. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, another woman hired Richardson in a breach of contract action 
and paid him $4,800 in advance, it was alleged in additional documents. She 
hired another attorney a month later, and he asked that Richardson give him the 
money, which was to be deposited in the client's trust account. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson sent a check for $500 that bounced, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Richardson wrote a $120 check from a client's trust account 
to pay for a filing fee in his own personal lawsuit, the court documents said. 
That check bounced, too. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Stanford University and UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall, Richardson 
practiced both criminal and civil law in Los Angeles and outlying cities. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to contact colleagues at the Richardson &amp; Associates law office 
Tuesday were unsuccessful.

DRUGS FOUND AMID APPLES SHIPPED EAST FROM L.A. 
</P>

Federal agents in New Jersey have found almost 900 pounds of cocaine hidden in 
a 13 1/2-ton load of apples being trucked from a produce market in Los Angeles 
to northern New York state, officials reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a combination of things that led us to it," Bob Van Etten, special 
agent in charge of the U.S. Customs Office in Newark, N.J., said. "One of those 
things was where those apples were going -- to Albany, in Upstate New York. 
That's like carrying coals to Newcastle." 
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested in New Jersey in connection with the seizure. Officials 
said the cocaine -- with a street value estimated at $40 million to $150 
million, depending on its purity and how it was marketed -- apparently was 
intended for distribution in northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Van Etten said that as a result of intelligence reports, investigators on the 
East Coast have been closely watching shipments of produce from Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is one of the major transshipment points for cocaine from Mexico 
and Central America, and refrigerated trucks carrying produce are often used 
because they are relatively difficult to inspect, according to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from Customs and the DEA seized the cocaine late Sunday night after a 
drug-sniffing dog detected the narcotics in a refrigerated, 45-foot 
truck-trailer parked in front of the Franklin Hotel in Port Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cocaine, packed in 1-kilo bricks, was concealed in cartons 
buried beneath boxes of apples on a pallet at the front of the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Segundino Reyes Flores, 36, a Cuban national living in Miami, Fla., was 
arrested at the hotel. Agents said he was the driver of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Arturo Ceron, 33, a Colombian living in Miami Springs, Fla., was 
arrested a few hours later at a motel in nearby Secaucus, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Ceron and Flores were being held without bail pending arraignment in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Van Etten said the 27,000 pounds of apples from Northern California and the 
state of Washington probably were purchased from a legitimate wholesaler in Los 
Angeles and that the cocaine was concealed later under the fruit.

BEVERLY HILLS TEACHERS TAKE PAY PROTEST TO RODEO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Beverly Hills school teachers took their protests to the street Tuesday -- and 
what a street they picked. 
</P>
<P>
Fashionable Rodeo Drive -- window shopper's paradise and the scene of many of a 
spending orgy -- served as the backdrop for a demonstration by 150 Beverly 
Hills teachers, who complain that their paychecks can't buy anything on the 
tony street. 
</P>
<P>
Ensnarled in a contract dispute with the Beverly Hills Unified School District, 
the teachers decided to take their protest to a location that would keenly 
illustrate a disparity in priorities that, they contend, is keeping their 
salaries too low. 
</P>
<P>
The protest site shows the difference between "how the community supports its 
business and how the school district supports its teachers," California 
Teachers Assn. President Ed Foglia said at a pre-march rally at the Beverly 
Hills Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
The march -- spanning four blocks from Santa Monica Boulevard to Dayton Drive 
-- lasted about one hour and was orderly. The teachers kept to the sidewalk and 
stopped for all the traffic lights. As they marched past such upscale boutiques 
as Nina Ricci and Giorgio, some of them gaped at the fancy merchandise -- the 
$3,000 cashmere capes and $1,500 silk tuxedos -- and then muttered about the 
prices, which wouldn't shock many of their students. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are very aware of what you wear and the cars you drive," said Beverly 
Vista Middle School teacher Kate LaRue, who says her $29,000-a-year salary is 
not enough to live on. "There's not a single student who intends to be a 
teacher. We're perceived as losers." 
</P>
<P>
One merchant tried to sell Beverly Hills High School teacher Frank Mahan a pair 
of shoes, but Mahan declined. "We shop at Pic 'n Save until we get a raise," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many shoppers and tourists along the route expressed sympathy for the teachers. 
But at least one visitor, David Radon of Kansas City, Mo., said he was was 
dismayed to run into "this mob of people." 
</P>
<P>
Current starting pay for the teachers is $21,604 annually, while top pay for 
those with nine years of experience is $46,270. The average salary is $42,659. 
</P>
<P>
The district's offer of a 9% increase over two years would put Beverly Hills 
teachers roughly on par with their counterparts in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, where teacher salaries this year range from $27,346 to 
$50,123. The Beverly Hills teachers are asking for an 18% increase over two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
They say they may strike on Oct. 16 if the contract dispute is not settled. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 42 unified districts in Los Angeles County, Beverly Hills has the 
smallest class sizes and spends the most -- more than $5,000 -- per pupil. 
</P>
<P>
The schools have long had a reputation for academic excellence. But, despite 
its rich image, the district has fallen on hard times in recent years, in part 
because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
To generate additional income, the district rents out school libraries and 
auditoriums to the city of Beverly Hills.

Ugandan authorities have released a U.N. relief plane, its two American pilots, 
two British passengers and three Kenyan crew members nearly three weeks after 
they were detained following an emergency landing in Uganda, officials said. 
Tarcis Kabwegyere, minister of state for foreign affairs, said the seven aboard 
and the aircraft, released Friday, are expected to leave for Nairobi today. The 
plane made an emergency landing Sept. 22 in Kaabong, in northeastern Uganda, 
after running out of fuel in bad weather. It was trying to return to 
Lokichoggio, Kenya, after delivering emergency food and other supplies to 
southern Sudan.

The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose ratings have 
plummeted in opinion polls, opened its annual conference in the northern 
English resort of Blackpool. With Britain's grim economic situation dominating 
the meeting, party officials defended their beleaguered finance minister, Nigel 
Lawson. Party Chairman Kenneth Baker opened the session by supporting Lawson 
and sought to boost morale with a fierce attack on the opposition Labor Party. 
Lawson's popularity tumbled when he decided to follow the lead of West 
Germany's Bundesbank and raised interest rates.

Riot police fought with about 1,000 protesters who demanded freedom for 
political prisoners and tried to reach a nearby National Day rally in Taipei 
sponsored by the government. About 2,000 police with clubs and shields formed 
human walls to keep the protesters from the rally outside the presidential 
office building. Seven people were reported injured, including five police 
officers. After the street battle, about 10,000 demonstrators massed outside a 
jail to demand the immediate release of prominent dissident Hsu Hsin-liang.

Twenty people, including four U.S. Customs Service workers and a former Cuban 
political prisoner, were indicted for smuggling nearly 40 tons of cocaine and 
marijuana into the country. The 15-count indictment by a federal grand jury in 
Miami charged the defendants, all of whom are in custody, with using law 
enforcement information provided by the customs employees to elude detection of 
their drug smuggling operation. "Employees who sell their badges and the trust 
of their fellow workers are really committing treason against the United States 
and should be punished as traitors to their country and the U.S. Customs 
Service," said the agency's assistant commissioner for internal affairs.

A stockbroker was arrested in the offices of Shearson Lehman Hutton in San 
Francisco on suspicion of defrauding one investor of more than $500,000 and 
diverting $2 million in funds belonging to 20 other investors into his personal 
account. Conrado Berenguer Topacio was accused in a federal complaint of bank 
and wire fraud in his handling of the account. An attorney for Shearson, which 
cooperated in the investigation of Topacio's alleged account tampering, told 
the FBI that Topacio issued Shearson checks to his client accounts, but then 
endorsed the checks to himself. Topacio, who denied diverting any funds from 
investor accounts, told the FBI he recruited offshore investors to begin stock 
trading accounts. According to the FBI affidavit, the investors asked for a 10% 
to 13% return in their investment and allowed Topacio complete discretion to 
invest the funds for one year.

With Southeast Asian refugee children crowding their classrooms, Merced City 
Elementary School District officials are considering a plan to help pay for 
training Hmong and Laotian refugees to become teachers. Officials said they 
need at least 85 bilingual instructors to work with Southeast Asian students, 
and the only way they can see to get them is to train some of the adult 
refugees. A survey last October showed that 24% of the 10,600 students in the 
district are Asian. About 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees, most of them Hmong, 
live in Merced County, mostly in the city of Merced. The county has the highest 
refugee population per capita in the nation. The district now does not have any 
teachers who speak Southeast Asian languages.

An Anaheim police officer shot and killed a Brea man who allegedly tried to

25, was pronounced dead at the shooting scene behind an Anaheim house. Two 
Anaheim officers watching for drug dealing in the 700 block of West Hall Avenue 
noticed a man acting suspiciously and confronted him, officers said. The man 
ran, and officers chased him several blocks -- stopping him as he tried to 
climb a fence to the rear yard of a house, police said. There, Rosenberger 
allegedly grabbed the butt of one officer's handgun in its holster, while the 
other officer struck the man with a night stick, police said. The officers 
managed to pull him away, but one of them opened fire when Rosenberger tried to 
lunge again, police said.

BUSH WILL MEET 3 LATIN CHIEFS IN DRUG SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

ICA, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presidents of South America's three principal cocaine-producing countries 
on Tuesday invited President Bush to a summit within 90 days to forge joint 
strategies in the "frontal assault" on drug trafficking, and Bush quickly 
accepted the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed his willingness to take part shortly after word of the proposal 
by Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Virgilio 
Barco Vargas of Colombia reached the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept. The President will go," Fitzwater declared. "I think everybody had 
felt a summit like this would be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the specific invitation to a summit conference caught the White 
House by surprise, even though Bush had mentioned such a meeting during his 
presidential campaign last year and again in a nationally televised speech 
Sept. 5 in which he outlined his anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said no discussions have been held on the specifics of such a summit, 
including its agenda, date, location or participants. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, Paz Zamora and Barco did not suggest where the summit should be held, 
although their invitation to Bush suggested that they want it to occur in Latin 
America, not in the United States. That appeared to raise the potential for 
disagreement, given possible security problems in the drug-producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica, Barbados, and Caracas, Venezuela, have been mentioned as possible 
sites, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're inviting us. We'll be talking about the location," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the three Latin presidents said a technical meeting 
would be held in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, on Nov. 20 to work out details of the 
joint proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by Troops 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a desert resort surrounded by army troops and police units, 
Garcia, Paz Zamora and Barco spent nearly five hours Tuesday coordinating 
common measures against the scourge afflicting their nations. 
</P>
<P>
The three presidents expressed their resolve to work together to combat cocaine 
trafficking, while acknowledging the differences in the problems of production, 
commercialization and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize that there is a growing universal awareness of the gravity of the 
problem and of the co-responsibility of the states" to counter it, the three 
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Peru and Bolivia, among the poorest countries in Latin America, together grow 
more than 80% of the coca leaves used in the production of cocaine. Colombia, 
home of the powerful drug cartels, is the center of final refining and 
marketing of cocaine to consumers in the United States and Europe. All three 
countries also have growing drug use problems of their own. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Peru is coping with a violent left-wing insurgency that has 
left more than 15,000 dead since 1980. The dominant rebel group is Sendero 
Luminoso (Shining Path), a Maoist guerrilla movement that has built up a 
tactical alliance with peasant coca growers and in recent days has killed 
dozens of people. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia has no insurgency problem, but its coca growers are bound together in 
powerful unions that oppose eradication programs. Colombia has endured a wave 
of violence since mid-August, when traffickers killed a leading presidential 
candidate and the government responded with a declaration of all-out war 
against the government. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining their security concerns, the presidents met in the small city of 
Ica, about 200 miles south of the Peruvian capital of Lima, in a virtual oasis 
surrounded by dozens of miles of bare desert sand. All approaches were guarded 
by security forces at roadblocks, and plainclothes officers patrolled the 
agricultural town of 150,000, reportedly rounding up hundreds of people without 
identity documents. 
</P>
<P>
The two visiting heads of state arrived by plane at a military air base in 
nearby Pisco and flew by helicopter to the grounds of a resort hotel on the 
edge of Ica. Soldiers with binoculars stood atop the mountainous sand dunes 
that surround the hotel, monitoring all approaches. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit preceded the third annual meeting today through Friday of 
the now-misnamed Group of Eight, an organization of presidents of Latin 
American democracies aimed at encouraging regional integration. 
</P>
<P>
Panama, the eighth member, was suspended last year after strongman Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega in effect deposed President Eric A. Delvalle. At this week's session 
the presidents are expected to consider a motion to expel Panama outright after 
Noriega's cancellation of election results last May. 
</P>
<P>
"We could ill permit a country like Panama, which makes a joke of the 
democratic system, to remain among us," Peruvian Foreign Minister Guillermo 
Larco Cox said Tuesday. "The Panamanian government is a usurper of the popular 
will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newly Elected 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven member countries, three have newly elected presidents: Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Carlos Saul 
Menem of Argentina. The other four, Garcia of Peru, Barco of Colombia, Julio 
Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay and Jose Sarney of Brazil, all will be leaving 
office within a year after elections in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
A brief communique read by Garcia after the talks Tuesday said the three 
leaders "take up the initiative of President George Bush. Therefore, we invite 
him to take part in a meeting in the next 90 days and also consider to be of 
great importance the possible participation of the countries of Europe in this 
meeting as well." 
</P>
<P>
In his anti-drug program announced Sept. 5, Bush pledged $261 million to the 
three Andean nations in this fiscal year to help them fight drug trafficking. 
Separately, the three nations had complained that the program overemphasizes 
repression of drug trafficking and offers too little economic help to allow the 
countries to devise viable alternatives for their people. Coca and cocaine 
bring billions of dollars a year into the three economies. 
</P>
<P>
The three presidents neither criticized nor praised the Bush initiative. Their 
statement avoided substantive comment on the drug problem, and the presidents 
declined to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to visit Costa Rica on Oct. 27-28, but officials have said 
for several weeks that if a drug summit is organized, it would not be held in 
conjunction with that meeting, because its host, Costa Rican President Oscar 
Arias Sanchez, has insisted that his summit focus entirely on the efforts to 
establish democracy in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a drug summit could take place within 90 days, Fitzwater said 
Bush had been talking about holding the meeting "by the end of the year," so 
that a 90-day time frame was "within the realm of possibility." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Bush and Barco had spoken about holding such a meeting when 
they met in Washington two weeks ago. "That probably fed the idea into the 
group" in Peru, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what such a meeting could accomplish, Fitzwater said, "You need a lot of 
coordination and information on international drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Smith reported from Ica, Peru, and Gerstenzang from Washington.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS OFFER THEIR DREAM LIST; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA: ADVOCATES AND POLITICIANS PROPOSE A SWEEPING INITIATIVE ENFORCED BY 
A CONSERVATION COP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the most audacious ballot initiatives ever offered to California 
voters, the state's major environmental groups and Democratic candidate for 
governor John K. Van de Kamp teamed up Tuesday with a proposal to turn 
California greener, to try and make its food, air and water cleaner, and to put 
a new conservationist cop on the beat in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Months in the drafting, the 39-page ballot proposition amounts to an 
environmentalist dream list for the 1990s. Its sponsors, among them some of the 
more prominent lawyers of the environmental movement and a few of its key 
politicians, promised that the proposition would: 
</P>
<P>
Phase out cancer-causing agricultural pesticides, tighten safeguards against 
oil spills, restrict chemicals that pollute the atmosphere, limit waste 
discharges, plant more trees, preserve tracts of old-growth virgin redwoods and 
expand health protection for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
A huge pot of $840 million in environmental financing is called for -- $500 
million in a trust fund for coastal oil spills, $300 million for reforestation 
projects and for acquisition of redwoods, and $40 million a year in grants for 
environmental research projects. 
</P>
<P>
And to enforce it all, and every other similar law on the books, the initiative 
establishes a new elected office of state environmental advocate with the power 
to sue anyone in government who gets in the way. The new office would come with 
a guaranteed annual budget of $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
The November, 1990, ballot proposition is an integral plank in a unique 
campaign strategy of Van de Kamp, the incumbent attorney general. His idea is 
to put his promises in writing so voters do not have to take his word for it 
but can "vote for me, vote for my platform." This initiative is one of three he 
is pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
For environmentalists, the proposition represents an effort to join behind a 
consensus package and ride what they believe is a rising tide of public anxiety 
about the deteriorating quality of life in California. 
</P>
<P>
For one other politician in the mix, Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
the proposition represents the potential for a future in statewide politics. 
Hayden was chairman of the committee that pulled the environmentalists and Van 
de Kamp together and drafted the proposition. He is expected to chair the 
campaign on its behalf. And on Tuesday, he suggested that the proposed 
environmental advocate to be elected in 1992 would be "a great office." 
</P>
<P>
"Today we are putting before the people of California a document that holds the 
promise of cleaner water, purer food and a healthier atmosphere," Van de Kamp 
said at press conferences in Los Angeles and San Francisco. He went on to 
describe it as an "environmental bill of rights." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden proclaimed the measure "the most significant proposal for protecting the 
environment ever placed before the voters in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Six environmental groups have a hand in the proposal, and most of them were on 
hand for Tuesday's unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts California back in the lead, where California belongs," said Bob 
Hattoy of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
"A home run!" said Al Meyerhoff of the National Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
"A first bold step into what we hope will be the decade of the environment," 
said Lucy Blake of the California League of Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups behind the proposal include the National Toxics Campaign, Campaign 
California, and Citizens for Better Environment. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors must obtain at least 500,000 signatures in the next five months to 
assure the proposition a place on the November ballot. Other questions about 
the dimensions of the campaign, its budget and composition, remain undecided 
pending the reaction of potential opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said that vociferous resistance is possible, particularly from 
agribusiness, once the measure is distributed widely and studied. The final 
version of the proposal was not complete and available to outsiders until late 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, environmentalists said they did not want to presume that 
this campaign will polarize the state along old battle lines -- consumers and 
environmentalists vs. growers and pesticide producers. In particular, sponsors 
of the initiative said they hope that some growers would find sufficient cause 
to support the proposal, or some of its provisions, or at least not engage in 
an hugely expensive campaign to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, it was the apple growers who lost $100 million in the Alar scare," 
noted Meyerhoff of the National Resources Defense Council. That was the 
disclosure that the chemical Alar was left on apples, which sent sales 
plunging. 
</P>
<P>
However, early and tentative grower response was not favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"Chances are we're going to find that it's overreacting to the situation. And 
it's going to make it tougher for farmers to make a living," said Clark Biggs, 
spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation. "We know it's part of the 
attorney general's campaign for governor and we don't like that." 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate for governor and U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson was equivocal in 
reacting. 
</P>
<P>
In a long letter, Wilson, who wants to project himself as a 
environmental-leaning Republican, lauded many of goals of the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Wilson said he supported the idea of eliminating poisons from 
food. But he questioned other areas of the measure -- whether California should 
embark unilaterally on its own campaign to eliminate CFCs, or 
chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for ozone depletion. Or, whether it is 
fiscally prudent to require secondary treatment of all sewage flowing into the 
ocean. Both are provisions of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson flatly opposed the establishing an elected office for an environmental 
advocate. "In my judgment, it is the responsibility of the governor to be the 
chief environmental advocate. I do not intend to delegate such a primary 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's chief Democratic rival, Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San 
Francisco, said she had not read the entire measure but shared a concern for 
the environment. "It's well-intended; we'll see if its well-drafted," her 
campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the proposal, agricultural chemicals that are known to cause 
cancer or reproductive injury would be phased out of use by 1996. State 
officials could extend the deadline three years in the event that no safe 
replacement chemicals are available or in the event of provable agricultural 
hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said that if applied today, about 15 specific chemicals would fall 
under the phase-out, including important fungicides, pesticides and fumigants. 
Initiative sponsors acknowledged that safe replacements are not now available. 
</P>
<P>
To counter would-be critics who might say that farmers are being driven into an 
impossible situation, the measure provides $40 million a year in research 
grants for such things as research for safer chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Of larger geographical importance, the initiative would impose the same 
limitations on residual pesticides in food imported from other states and 
countries as established for California grown. Because of the huge consumer 
market here, sponsors said this provision would have the effect of changing 
pesticide use and formulas around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal does not directly attack smog. Sponsors said they did not want to 
duplicate the work of agencies such as the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But it does address two types of airborne chemicals -- carbon dioxide and CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Without saying how the goals are to be accomplished, the initiative declares 
that California must reduce carbon dioxide emissions 20% by the year 2000 and 
40% by 2010. Scientists say carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will contribute to 
global warming, commonly called the "greenhouse" effect. The measure takes a 
strong hand on CFCs -- ordering them phased out by 1997 except in cases of 
medical need or economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
One of the last elements that drafters agreed to put in the measure is also one 
that wanders furthest from the "air, water and food" theme. This is a ban on 
logging virgin redwoods for one year. The idea is to give the government time 
to survey remaining stands and buy up the choicest, using $200 million of the 
proceeds of a $300-million bond issue that is contained in the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining $100 million would be used for assorted other reforestation 
projects, urban and rural. Additionally, developers in the future would be 
required to plant one tree for every 500 square feet of new construction. 
</P>
<P>
California law requires that an initiative cover only a single subject. Because 
this one is so broad, early questions arose over whether it would fit under 
that requirement. Sponsors said they felt they met the test because, in the 
words of one drafter, "everything fits under the subject of environmental 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Miller, chief deputy secretary of state, agreed that the single-subject 
rule can have a broad interpretation, although the courts have not ruled 
recently on any significant test case. "As long as you can come up with one 
concept to include all the parts, it's probably OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors must now obtain 372,178 valid signatures of registered voters during 
the next 150 days to qualify the proposition for a spot on the ballot on Nov. 
8, 1990. By rule of thumb, 500,000 to 600,000 signatures actually will have to 
be collected to assure that enough of those who sign are actually registered to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE 
</P>
<P>
FOOD 
</P>
<P>
Calls for the phase-out of all agricultural chemicals known to cause cancer or 
reproductive harm by 1996. State officials can add a three-year extension in 
the event of agricultural hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Food imported to California must meet the same standards as that grown locally. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for the health of farm workers to be transferred from the state 
Department of Agriculture to the Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
AIR 
</P>
<P>
Calls for phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, linked to destruction of 
atmospheric ozone, by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Establishes a goal for reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide, suspected of 
contributing to global greenhouse effect, of 20% by 2000 and 40% by 2010. 
Methods for achieving goals are unspecified. 
</P>
<P>
Requires developers to plant a tree for every 500 square feet of future 
development. A $300-million bond issue is proposed for reforestation efforts 
and to buy virgin stands of redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
WATER 
</P>
<P>
By taxing oil passing through California at 25 cents a barrel, a $500-million 
fund is proposed to respond to oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
Vastly expands contingency planning and financial responsibility for spills. 
</P>
<P>
Reaffirms that all California public sewage plants meet federal discharge 
standards by 2000. Industries that discharge into state waters will have to 
establish a toxics monitoring program. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER 
</P>
<P>
Prohibits cutting of old-growth redwoods for one year while the state takes 
inventory and makes public purchase arrangements. Afterward, clear-cutting of 
such stands is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1992, a new Office of Environmental Advocate is established. The 
office will be elective. The advocate is allowed an annual budget of $40 
million to award grants for environmental research.

<P>
Under normal circumstances, it would have been a classic case of one man's word 
against another's -- and the cop probably would have won. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Johnson, a 24-year-old computer technician, said a Sacramento sheriff's 
deputy put a pistol to his throat after pulling him over on suspicion of drunk 
driving. The deputy, Kevin L. Wise, denied it. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you ever draw your weapon and point your weapon at Mr. Johnson?" defense 
attorney Steven E. King asked during a preliminary hearing. "No, sir," Wise 
replied under oath, totally unaware of the evidence to come. 
</P>
<P>
He was captured on videotape. Taken by a security guard at an industrial 
complex near where the car was stopped, the tape showed the deputy taking his 
gun from his holster and sticking it under Johnson's chin. 
</P>
<P>
When prosecutors saw it, the drunk-driving case was dropped. Now it is the 
deputy who faces criminal charges, counts of perjury and assault. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question but without the tape we wouldn't have a case," said 
Sacramento County Supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Al Locher. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a turnaround is extraordinary, the case is merely one of a string 
of recent incidents in which the Video Age has put police unexpectedly on film 
-- and on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 18 months, onlookers with home video cameras have recorded efforts 
by police to break up boisterous parties in Victorville, Torrance and Cerritos, 
prompting brutality complaints and lawsuits. Videotapes made by bystanders 
fueled scrutiny of officers clearing a park in Manhattan and dispersing 
students who flocked to Virginia Beach, Va., over Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there is former Hawthorne Sgt. Don Jackson, who took his camera 
throughout the Los Angeles area in search of police misconduct, finally 
"stinging" two Long Beach officers. 
</P>
<P>
So how are law enforcement officials responding to what the director of one 
video trade group calls "the democratization of surveillance"? 
</P>
<P>
Often by videotaping the action themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles and San Francisco police departments have special crews that 
tape demonstrations and other events where officers' actions may be questioned. 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has started putting video cameras 
in the cars of field supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"If the citizen is going to stand by and photograph or record the actions of 
our officers, then we feel it's in our best interests to do something similar," 
Sheriff's Cmdr. Ray Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department has five sworn officers and four civilians in 
its "TV, Photo and Sound Unit." Most of their time is spent producing weekly 
training videotapes, but the crew also goes out in the field to record 
sensitive events such as last spring's Operation Rescue anti-abortion 
demonstrations. "We videotaped them for the courts so they can see what we've 
done," Officer John Green said. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, however, the tapes backfired. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors thought they provided graphic evidence of protesters trespassing at 
a women's clinic. But Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry and four colleagues 
were acquitted, and jurors later explained that they had been shocked by the 
"pain compliance" holds used by police in making arrests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Tapes Cited 
</P>
<P>
In Pittsburgh and Sacramento as well, Operation Rescue protesters cited police 
videotapes in complaining of excessive force by officers. 
</P>
<P>
But police in Miami, more in tune with the Video Age, used stretchers in April 
to carry more than 100 anti-abortion demonstrators to waiting buses, carefully 
avoiding the "pain compliance" holds. 
</P>
<P>
"Prosecutors have told us that the come-along holds don't look good on 
videotape in court," explained Metro Dade Police Maj. Madeline Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Police Department videotapes 200 demonstrations a year "for 
evidence and training purposes," according to Sgt. Jerry Senkir. "We have a 
couple of guys who routinely do this so they get pretty good at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The department came under criticism this spring when two officers were 
discovered pretending to be TV cameramen from Seattle at a demonstration in 
front of the El Salvador consul general's office. Police Chief Frank Jordan 
quickly promised to stop such impersonations. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco police are embroiled in what is, in essence, a battle of 
videotapes -- a type of dispute that may someday become common with the 
proliferation of video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Huerta, co-founder and vice president of the United Farm Workers, filed 
a $23.7-million suit against the city Sept. 14, alleging that an officer broke 
five of her ribs and ruptured her spleen during a rally last year. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was reassigned after television videotapes showed him thrusting his 
wooden baton into a crowd outside a hotel where then-Vice President George Bush 
was holding a campaign fund-raiser. Huerta was distributing grape boycott 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Somewhat Deceptive' 
</P>
<P>
Senkir complained that one crucial TV tape is "somewhat deceptive" because it 
was edited to show two points of views of the incident, stretching 30 seconds 
of action into a minute of film. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons we do it," he said of the police filming. "Nobody 
can tamper with ours." 
</P>
<P>
But Dianna C. Lyons, the attorney for the United Farm Workers, complained that 
the police tape, while showing Huerta in the crowd, missed the moment when she 
was struck. 
</P>
<P>
The police photographer "immediately pans to the pavement when he notices 
anything questionable," she said. "It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said she may recommend that the UFW use video cameras to monitor police 
responses to all its demonstrations. "We used to use still cameras for the same 
purpose," she said. "It's just not as effective." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most startling videotapes of police in action have been made when 
there was no way to predict a confrontation, when a home video camera -- which 
can operate without the conspicuous crews and lights of television -- just 
happened to be around. 
</P>
<P>
It is a situation police may be confronting almost routinely. Introduced in 
1985, small camcorders are being sold at the rate of 2.5 million a year and are 
in about 8% of American homes, according to the Electronic Industries Assn. 
</P>
<P>
They have come into play in some recent incidents: 
</P>
<P>
* On June 30, 1988, an onlooker videotaped an altercation between five Mexican 
nationals and San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies at a party in 
Victorville. Latino community leaders said the tape was evidence that the men 
were kicked and clubbed without provocation. "If you want to see brutality in 
the videotape, you will see it," responded Sheriff Floyd Tidwell. "But if you 
look at it with an open mind . . . you will not see brutality." He ruled that 
his men used proper force to overcome resistance. A $15-million suit is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
* In August, 1988, videotapes shot by two amateur photographers at New York's 
Tompkins Square Park showed people being clubbed by officers whose badge 
numbers were concealed with black tape when they moved in to enforce a 1 a.m. 
curfew. Mayor Ed Koch called the videotapes "very disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
* Armed with a videotape of two policemen choking and beating 20-year-old 
Thomas Tice, attorneys for Tice and five friends filed suit in 1988 against the 
Torrance Police Department over efforts to break up a party in that community. 
Police said the officers had to subdue Tice, who later pleaded no contest to 
disturbing the peace, after they were surrounded by 35 hostile party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
* Last Feb. 11, a camera at a Cerritos bridal shower photographed a Los Angeles 
sheriff's deputy using his baton to hit two men on the ground. "Once anyone 
sees those tapes, they'll realize this is not an empty complaint," said Garo 
Mardirossian, an attorney for the family hosting the party. Sheriff Sherman 
Block said 10 deputies were battered and bruised by party-goers, including a 
female professional wrestler known as "Mt. Fiji." 
</P>
<P>
* The FBI is reviewing videotapes of Virginia Beach officers using clubs to 
clear the streets of black youths, who later complained that they were roughed 
up over Labor Day weekend. The police crackdown followed a night of rioting, 
looting and bottle-throwing that resulted in 43 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
To Norman Abrams, a professor and associate dean at UCLA Law School who teaches 
a course on evidence, such incidents illustrate both the value and limits of 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a picture of the actual event . . . rather than the statements of 
witnesses, obviously that's very powerful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open to Challenge 
</P>
<P>
But such evidence is also open to challenge as to whether it is authentic and 
whether there is "distortion based on the location and the timing," he said, 
for instance if the taping begins "in the middle" of an incident. 
</P>
<P>
Few instances of videotaping have occurred more by chance than in the April 13, 
1988, arrest of Eric Johnson on suspicion of drunk driving in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's gray BMW just happened to be stopped outside an industrial park. A 
security guard just happened to notice the flashing police lights on a 
surveillance monitor. The outside camera just happened to have remote control 
and zoom-in capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The guard pushed the record button. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson worked at the industrial park and learned of the videotape. But his 
attorney, King, did not alert prosecutors until after a preliminary hearing 
when he got Deputy Wise to deny on the record that he pulled his gun. 
</P>
<P>
Then King delivered the tape to the Sacramento County district attorney's 
office, declaring, "The deputy lied." 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed by prosecutors in Sacramento Municipal Court, 
Wise was confronted with the videotape and acknowledged his actions were 
"inappropriate." The deputy's defense was that he did not remember drawing his 
gun and did not consciously lie at the court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Trial for Wise, who resigned from the Sheriff's Department, is scheduled for 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a stroke of luck," concluded King, who figures his client would 
have been convicted without the tape. "Typically, when push comes to shove, 
jurors go along with police officers over private citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Locher said there is a lesson in the incident for police: "I don't 
think anyone, particularly a law enforcement officer, should conduct themselves 
in public in a way they wouldn't want to be seen on the evening news." 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials say the lesson is so obvious that there is no 
need to give students at their training academies special instructions in 
dealing with home videotapers. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the officer is doing what he's supposed to be doing, there is no 
fear of video cameras," said Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Betty Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
But the leading advocate of citizen videotaping insists that police, in fact, 
are far from casual about the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's having dramatic impact. . . . They're looking over their shoulder," said 
Jackson, the former Hawthorne sergeant who gained national renown when a 
television crew secretly recorded his arrest by two Long Beach officers after a 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
The officers' report claimed that Jackson cursed them. But the tape showed only 
the officers cursing during the arrest, in which Jackson's head appears to be 
pushed through a store window. Both officers are awaiting trial on charges of 
filing a false report, and one also is accused of assault under the color of 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
After complaining of racism in his own department, Jackson, who is black, began 
carrying a video camera in his car in late 1987, cruising the Los Angeles area 
looking for police in action. He also conducted what he described as "stings" 
to test police. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, weeks after 27-year-old Karen Toshima was killed in gang 
cross-fire in Westwood, Jackson drove six black youths to the community, then 
videotaped Los Angeles police as they questioned and searched the youths. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson quickly drew a rebuke from Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who 
called his action "a crazy, crazy, stupid, idiotic act." 
</P>
<P>
Gates made his comments in a statement to his officers -- by videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Jackson encourages videotaping by police themselves. He noted that 
some officers have long carried small tape recorders to document their 
interaction with citizens as a defense against complaints of mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a smart move," he said. "The sword cuts both ways. I don't have 
any stomach for people who make false claims against police. . . . They're 
under enough pressure already." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of all sides carrying video cameras into public forums seems a healthy 
thing to Lawrence Sapadin, executive director of the Assn. of Independent Video 
and Filmmakers, a New York-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Sapadin is the one who calls it "the democratization of surveillance. . . . 
Ordinary citizens can take pictures of the world around them, and if some of 
that involves catching cops making mistakes, that's good." 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, he said, a benefit of all the videotaping will be to teach 
people the limits of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"One educational aspect to this 'dueling cameras' aspect of it is that cameras 
are just an extension of an individual's point of view," he said. "Each person 
pointing a camera may see a different thing."

USE OF RICO TO SUE ABORTION PROTESTERS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for a tough federal anti-racketeering 
law to be used against militant abortion protesters who break into abortion 
clinics and harass customers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
With only one dissenting vote, the justices refused to consider an appeal by 
anti-abortion activists in Philadelphia who contended that they, like the civil 
rights protesters of the 1960s, had a First Amendment right to stage sit-ins. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the high court let stand an appeals court ruling that provided a 
powerful weapon -- the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act -- against protesters who use intimidation or force to disrupt their 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, anti-abortion protesters may march in front of clinics, shout 
slogans and carry signs. But, if they invade a facility, attack its employees 
or block pregnant women from entering, they can be charged with violating the 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
If found guilty of RICO violations, they can be forced to pay three times the 
actual business loss suffered by a clinic. They must also pay the clinic's 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 protesters in the Philadelphia case were assessed fines and legal fees 
totaling $108,000. They were found to have broken into the Northeast Women's 
Center on four occasions and to have damaged equipment, stolen supplies and 
assaulted employees. 
</P>
<P>
The high court action gives a boost to a similar racketeering suit brought by 
the National Organization for Women against the Operation Rescue anti-abortion 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Chicago, accuses the group of conspiring to drive abortion 
clinics out of business through bombings, break-ins, violent protests and other 
illegal means. Although the case is still months away from trial, NOW is 
seeking a nationwide court injunction against Operation Rescue and its 
affiliated groups. 
</P>
<P>
"This (high court action) certainly gives us encouragement," Patricia Ireland, 
NOW's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. "All the court is saying 
is that, if you act like a gangster, you'll get treated like a gangster." 
</P>
<P>
Ireland and other lawyers cautioned, however, that the high court decision is 
not a binding ruling on the issue. It merely leaves standing a decision of the 
U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. Other federal courts are 
free to rule differently. 
</P>
<P>
At the least, the decision indicates that the justices are not ready to set 
constitutional limits on RICO or to come to the aid of law-breaking 
anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McMonagle, director of the Pro-Life Coalition of Southeast Pennsylvania 
and a leader of the protests, said that he would not be deterred by the 
decision. "This is one battle in a long war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his appeal to the high court, McMonagle said that, under RICO, Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. could have been branded a racketeer for leading sit-ins at 
segregated lunch counters in the South. 
</P>
<P>
But the Philadelphia jury that heard the case was said to have been swayed by 
videotapes showing angry and belligerent protesters pushing and shoving 
pregnant women and clinic employees. The clinic's lawyers said the high court 
decision means that abortion protesters may not use "fear and intimidation" to 
close abortion facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Only Justice Byron R. White voted to hear the case (McMonagle vs. Northeast 
Women's Clinic, 88-2137). 
</P>
<P>
For the Supreme Court, the 1970 anti-racketeering law has become a persistent 
headache, with no relief in sight. The justices, both liberal and conservative, 
have made it clear that they are troubled by RICO's broad reach and vague 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
A RICO offense must be triggered by "at least two acts of racketeering" within 
a 10-year period. But racketeering is defined to include everything from murder 
and extortion to mail fraud or securities fraud. In the Philadelphia case, the 
protesters were found to have used extortion to close down the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Although it originally was designed to attack organized crime and its 
infiltration into legitimate businesses, RICO in recent years has been used 
against all manner of violators, from insurance agents and accountants to stock 
traders and sellers of pornographic books. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in lengthy opinions in 1985 and earlier this year, the high court 
concluded that it would be up to Congress, not the judiciary, to rewrite the 
law and narrow its scope. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on a bill to 
curb RICO in civil cases. Under the legislation, in most business fraud cases 
plaintiffs no longer would be able to win triple damages and have their 
attorneys' fees paid. But neither the Senate bill nor a similar House bill 
would alter the law when used in criminal cases brought by the government. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Overturned a libel award against a Pennsylvania newspaper for publishing 
secretly recorded telephone conversations that appeared in a court record 
(Easton Publishing vs. Boettger, 89-265). In June, the high court said that the 
news media may not be punished for accurately reporting lawfully obtained 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide a high-stakes patent dispute involving new medical 
equipment (Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic, 89-243). The Food and Drug Act permits 
makers of generic drugs to test-market their products before the patent on an 
original drug has expired. Earlier this year, a federal appeals court said that 
the same patent exemption applies to new high-tech medical devices. On appeal, 
the Eli Lilly Co. said that this decision will cost it millions of dollars in 
lost sales for its patented heart defibrillator and that it threatens to 
undercut medical research nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Almost 20 years ago, Congress enacted a broad anti-racketeering law, the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It was aimed at Mafia 
figures infiltrating and preying on legitimate businesses. Two or more acts of 
racketeering -- including everything from murder and extortion to mail fraud or 
securities fraud -- can be prosecuted under the act. Increasingly, however, 
private lawyers have invoked the law in ways apparently never envisioned by 
Congress.

It had taken a days-long hunger strike by her family, some unusual bureaucratic 
maneuvering, a grueling 10-hour train ride though Romania and a 20-hour 
overseas flight to get Livia Groza to the United States. And when the journey 
finally ended Tuesday, she headed straight for the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Not to eat, but to work. It was her party, but Groza couldn't resist helping 
out with a tremendous array of Romanian delicacies that her family had prepared 
at their Westminster home to celebrate her long-sought immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after everyone else had been served, the guest of honor agreed to sit 
down. Sampling a piece of soft bread with an amazed look on her face, Groza 
whispered to her 9-year-old granddaughter in her native tongue: "In Romania, 
the bread is as hard as the table." 
</P>
<P>
It had been a long road to the table. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1984, her son-in-law, 31-year-old Vasile Sofroni, had eluded armed 
Romanian border patrol guards and sneaked through trenches to escape what he 
calls the oppressive life style of the East Bloc regime. A maintenance worker, 
he eventually settled in Westminster and was able to bring his wife, Lia, and 
two young children to the United States to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
But Groza was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, her family in the United States desperately implored U.S. 
officials to allow her to immigrate, citing her failing health and inability to 
work. Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) offered assistance. But the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service rejected her visa application last May, 
saying that Groza, now 55, was still young enough to support herself and thus 
did not have to be with her family. 
</P>
<P>
So, with traditional immigration routes exhausted, Lia and Vasile Sofroni 
camped outside the federal immigration office in Westminster in July and went 
on what ended up being an 80-hour hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
News media publicized their story throughout the Southland. Dornan renewed his 
calls for assistance. And outgoing INS Western Regional Commissioner Harold 
Ezell appealed directly to higher federal officials for help in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The INS reversed itself. On their second review, federal officials decided that 
Groza's poor health and the Romanian government's refusal to let her work after 
she had applied for a visa warranted a rarely used humanitarian visa. 
</P>
<P>
"We had all the right ingredients (for a humanitarian) visa," said Dornan aide 
Patricia Fanelli, who worked on the Groza immigration for a year and helped 
welcome her Tuesday. "It was a very compelling case -- a woman under an 
extremely suppressive government, with her family gone, and she's sick and 
unable to work." 
</P>
<P>
With her visa finally approved, Groza said a tearful goodby to friends in 
Romania, took a 10-hour train ride from her village of Giulvaz to the Romanian 
capital of Bucharest, and flew to New York City, where she was met by Vasile 
Sofroni. They flew together to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After withstanding a media onslaught upon arrival at Los Angeles International 
Airport, Groza met her daughter and two grandchildren, who arrived late at the 
airport and made their way through the crowd to embrace Groza tearfully. "I 
feel very, very happy, very lucky," Lia Sofroni said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sofronis are taking a two-week vacation with plans to go to Disneyland, Las 
Vegas and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But Groza said she doesn't particularly care what they do. "I don't want to go 
anywhere. I just want to stay here with my family and be happy," she said in 
Romanian. 
</P>
<P>
And she said she has no desire to return to her homeland, wanting instead to 
leave the memories behind. 
</P>
<P>
Explained her son-in-law, Vasile Sofroni: "Here, we got everything. There they 
stand in line three, four hours for piece of bread. There, if you want to go 
from the village to the city, they ask you why you want to go. . . . Here, we 
have freedom? Why go back?"

JUSTICES TO NAME REFEREE IN FIGHT FOR WATER SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it will appoint a referee to decide 
whether three Indian tribes bordering the Colorado River are entitled to water 
currently flowing to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are billions of gallons of water serving the annual needs of half a 
million residents of Southern California, according to attorneys for the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark 1963 Supreme Court ruling, shares of the Colorado River water 
were divided among Arizona, California and Nevada. California was supposed to 
siphon off part of its share for three relatively small tribes living along the 
river in the state, but the court did not decree how much. 
</P>
<P>
California has been setting aside 121,000 acre-feet for the tribes. But in 
1969, the Interior Department claimed broader boundaries for the reservations 
and said the Indians are entitled to an additional 104,000 acre-feet of water, 
or enough to serve 500,000 people annually. Attorneys for California and the 
MWD disputed those claims and have been trying to get a final resolution of the 
matter ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is an "urgent need" to settle the matter, the MWD told the court, 
because Arizona will soon be using all of its share of water. For years, 
California has used all of its share, as well as the unused portion of 
Arizona's allotment. 
</P>
<P>
It is "essential that the reservations' water rights . . . be finally 
established in order to facilitate necessary water planning in California and 
Arizona," the MWD said. 
</P>
<P>
The "special master" named by the court first will determine land boundaries 
for the reservations of the Ft. Mojave, Colorado River and Ft. Yuma Indians. 
Under previous high court decisions, the tribes' share of the water has 
depended on the "practicably irrigable acreage" within their reservation. Since 
the needs of the Indians along the river take priority over any water going to 
Southern California, any increase granted the three tribes will reduce the 
water available to the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
California is entitled to 4.4 million acre-feet of water, which is more than 
half of the total available from the river. The MWD supplies water to 27 water 
agencies stretching from Ventura to the Mexican border, which serve half of the 
state's population. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of how much water the tribes should get has been fought in various 
arenas for 20 years. The MWD lawyers at one point took their case to a federal 
judge, only to have the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals later rule that the 
judge had no jurisdiction to decide the issue. The Supreme Court agreed to hear 
the MWD's appeal of that ruling but was split, 4 to 4, and unable to decide the 
question. Justice Thurgood Marshall takes no part in cases growing out of the 
1963 ruling because he represented the government at an early stage of the 
dispute. MWD lawyers went back to the Supreme Court this summer and asked the 
justices to settle the matter by appointing a master. The court has the power 
to decide boundary disputes involving the states and that power was invoked 
Monday in the case (Arizona vs. California, No. 8). 
</P>
<P>
The justices did not name a special master Monday but said merely that they had 
agreed to "reopen" the case to settle the "disputed boundary claims." 
</P>
<P>
"We will litigate this before the special master just as if it was a trial 
court," said Jerome Muys, a Washington lawyer for the MWD. Both sides will 
present testimony and a written decision will be entered.

HER PAINTING HITS JACKPOT OF ART -- $100,000

<P>
For months earlier this year, the light in the attic of the three-story 1903 
Queen Anne frame home in this hamlet 35 miles north of San Francisco glowed far 
into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Borge was busy working in her attic, creating an acrylic painting on an 
18- by 24-inch canvas depicting rare Bishop pines at Grossi Pond nestled in 
mountains at nearby Point Reyes National Seashore. 
</P>
<P>
"My family said I was obsessed with this painting. I worked day and night on 
it, whenever I had a chance. I kept making changes. I almost ruined it several 
times. It was a struggling painting. But somehow I managed to finish it," 
recalled the tall, blue-eyed artist with champagne-colored hair. 
</P>
<P>
It was all worth it. The painting won what is described as "the richest open 
art competition in America" -- the $100,000 Arts in the Parks contest sponsored 
by the National Parks Academy of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Borge was one of 2,323 artists from 49 states who each paid a $50 entry fee to 
submit an original work -- in watercolor, oil, acrylic, pencil or any 
two-dimensional medium -- in the contest, in its third year. 
</P>
<P>
Contestants had to enter unsigned, unframed works on the same size canvas 
illustrating something in any of the 368 National Park units in the nation. The 
winner was announced Sept. 16 at a banquet in Jackson, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
"I nearly fell through the floor. None of the artists had any hint of who was 
going to win until the announcement at the banquet. I have been riding a cloud 
ever since," Borge said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the artists allowed, "This beats the lottery. The odds to win $100,000 
were one in 2,323 for a $50 investment compared to about one in 10 million in a 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
Judging the contest were Douglas Lewis, curator of the National Gallery in the 
nation's capital; Susan Hallsten McGarry, editor-in-chief of Southwest Art 
Magazine, and David Wagner, executive director of the Colorado Springs Fine 
Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The judges said of Borge's painting, "It was the lighting effect that made this 
so irresistible, the plein-air, the feeling of the sense of the place." 
</P>
<P>
Borge's painting shows fog in the folds of mountains overlooking the peaceful 
valley of pines and pond. "I tried to capture that magic moment as the sun was 
setting when the hills were bathed in a rusty, pink, yellow, orange glow, the 
apricot mood of sundown," explained the artist. 
</P>
<P>
She placed her painting in the mail at 3 p.m. on June 30, nine hours before the 
contest deadline. "I did not feel I had professionally finished enough of the 
small details, but the judges apparently didn't care about that. It was a great 
stroke of luck my winning," she mused. 
</P>
<P>
Borge has been painting since she was a student at the California College of 
Arts and Crafts in Oakland. There she met her husband of 40 years, artist and 
art professor Ralph Borge. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, I entered a number of contests but never won more than $100 
or $200. I didn't enter contests for years until 1987 when I read about the 
first Arts in the Parks $100,000 competition in Art News," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Wow! Imagine winning a prize like that.' So, I did a 
painting of cypress trees in Point Reyes at Drake's Estero . . . selected as 
one of the top 100 from 2,700 entries that year," she continued. 
</P>
<P>
But Borge didn't win that year, and she didn't enter last year. She decided to 
try again this year. 
</P>
<P>
The most money she has ever received for a painting until now was $5,000. She 
and her husband open the living room of their Victorian home and turn it into 
an art gallery every Sunday afternoon to exhibit their paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"For painters it is always feast or famine," Borge said with a laugh. She said 
she will use the prize money to fix up the house and help pay for her youngest 
son's graduate school tuition at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Her painting and a selection of the top 100 paintings will go on a year-long 
national tour to museums and art galleries. Prints are made, as are calendars 
and cards. Proceeds go to the National Park Foundation created by Congress in 
1967 to encourage the private sector's support of the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Borge's winning painting and others from the contest will also be exhibited in 
Europe next spring to help promote foreign tourism to America's national parks. 
Her painting is now part of the National Park Foundation's permanent 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
The other paintings in the top 100 are sold, with the artist receiving 60% and 
the academy 40%. The National Parks Academy of the Arts was conceived by 
children's book illustrator Patti Boyd, 41, of Jackson Hole, Wyo., who is the 
organization's executive director.

JUDGE UPHOLDS RATE FREEZE ON AUTO POLICIES; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: AN AMBIGUOUS SUPERIOR COURT RULING LEAVES INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
ROXANI GILLESPIE'S CAP ON THE COST OF CAR COVERAGE INTACT FOR NOW. 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge left Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
Gillespie's freeze on auto insurance rate increases in effect until at least 
the end of November on Tuesday, telling the Farmers group of companies not to 
raise its rates on Nov. 1 as the company had planned. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Miriam A. Vogel, in an ambiguous decision that left Gillespie and 
Farmers attorneys disagreeing over what had been ordered, said that on Dec. 1, 
or a later date she may set, Farmers will be free to implement its 5.9% rate 
increase -- subject to Gillespie's review. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, saying that she will review the increase immediately and that she 
has the power to strike it down the day it is implemented, said the court 
decision had left her rate freeze, announced on Oct. 2, "alive and well." 
Gillespie told reporters, "Basically we won. The freeze is intact." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers representatives disagreed. The lead Farmers attorney, Leonard Venger, 
said that Farmers will be free to raise its rates by 5.9% on the date 
eventually set by Judge Vogel, and that the review by Gillespie will have to 
follow due process, meaning it could take weeks or months of hearings, and that 
any such review will be subject to a court appeal by Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, a Farmers spokesman announced that the company will notify all 
policyholders who had received notice of the rate increase that it is being 
delayed about a month beyond the original Nov. 1 implementation date. 
</P>
<P>
As the two parties quarreled before a battery of news cameras on what the judge 
had done, Vogel's clerk said the judge's order was not so much a decision by 
her as an agreed-upon stipulation by Gillespie's special counsel, Karl 
Rubinstein, and Farmers attorneys as to what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk said the judge's formal order did not state Vogel's understanding of 
what would happen but simply referred back to the transcript of the hearing and 
cited what the two parties had agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk said the transcript would not be available for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
During the actual court session, Vogel had asked several times for the two 
parties to express their understanding of the stipulated agreement. However, 
each time she did so, the parties were in wide disagreement on what the 
agreement contained, and the judge's attempt to clarify the matter apparently 
was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, neither of the parties could agree on the ultimate 
effect of the decision, except that it allows Gillespie's freeze to remain 
intact through the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
The judge set a Nov. 21 status hearing at which she will review the situation 
and set a precise date for Farmers to try to implement its rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Tuesday's proceedings on other companies, and their possible 
desire to raise rates despite the Gillespie freeze, was unclear. Consumer 
representatives who were present at the hearing, meanwhile, questioned whether 
Vogel could properly accede to any rate increase that will take place after 
Nov. 8, the date Gillespie gains formal authority under Proposition 103 to 
approve or disapprove all rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer representatives, such as Steven Miller of the Insurance Consumer 
Action Network, said it appeared that Vogel was ready to allow Farmers to 
eventually raise its rates after Nov. 8 without the prior approval of 
Gillespie, even though subject to Gillespie's later review. They said this 
contravenes Proposition 103 and questioned whether Vogel had realized that. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a bit of time was taken up during the hearing with questions by the judge 
to Rubinstein, Gillespie's counsel, on how long the insurance commissioner 
thought it necessary for the freeze to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said that Gillespie is trying to make a deal with the insurance 
companies for expediting progress at hearings she has called to begin Oct. 30 
on major Proposition 103 implementation issues, including new methods of 
pricing auto insurance that will give less emphasis to where a driver lives. 
</P>
<P>
If the insurers agree to cooperate, Rubinstein said, Gillespie hopes the key 
issues of insurance pricing will be settled by the end of November, and that 
the freeze could be lifted by that time. 
</P>
<P>
However, even after that, Proposition 103 states that all rate increases by 
insurers are supposed to be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner, 
a process that could take months. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said she did not believe that it was right to prevent Farmers from 
implementing the 5.9% rate increase for many months. 
</P>
<P>
So, she said, she wanted to allow it to go into effect after the hearings had 
resolved the pricing issues, probably around Dec. 1, but subject to Gillespie's 
review. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said she was calling the Nov. 21 status hearing so that she could 
ascertain whether the hearings were making progress, and if they were not, who 
was to blame. She said she reserved the right to come down hard on whatever 
party, the insurers, the consumers or Gillespie, was to blame for any lack of 
progress.

Leaders of a political movement in the southern republic of Azerbaijan 
suspended on Tuesday a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel, food and 
housing supplies to neighboring Armenia, a member said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided in a directive to open the railroad to Armenia as of 2200 (10 
p.m.)," said Ingilap Aslanov, a member of the grass-roots People's Front, in a 
telephone interview from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. 
</P>
<P>
He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give lawmakers in Moscow a 
chance to respond to Azerbaijan's demands to remove special Kremlin 
administration of the Nagorno-Karabakh area -- the source of a ethnic strife 
between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops moved into the Caucasus republics last week to break the strike 
and blockade that has been strangling Armenia and the Armenian enclave of 
Nagorno-Karabakh.

TWO NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES SLAIN IN COLOMBIA

Gunmen on motorcycles killed two employees of the newspaper El Espectador in 
Medellin in separate attacks Tuesday in an apparent effort by cocaine 
traffickers to force the daily to end its anti-drug crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings followed 13 bombings reported in three other Colombian cities 
overnight. It was the largest outbreak of bomb attacks since drug lords, blamed 
for killing a presidential candidate, went to war with the government nearly 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of violence came during a visit to Colombia by U.S. Army Gen. 
Maxwell Thurman, the head of the U.S. Southern Command based in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Killed within an hour of each other were Marta Luz Lopez and Miguel Soler, a 
newspaper spokesman said. Lopez was administrator of the paper's Medellin 
office; Soler was the circulation manager. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller later told the newspaper that the killings were the work of 
"the Extraditables," suspected drug traffickers who are sought for extradition 
to stand trial in the United States. The caller also said that any other El 
Espectador employees who did not leave Medellin within three days would be 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper has long suffered from attacks by drug traffickers angry at its 
calls for government action against them. 
</P>
<P>
El Espectador Publisher Guillermo Cano was assassinated by drug traffickers in 
a spray of machine-gun fire Dec. 17, 1986, as he was leaving the newspaper in 
his car. And the main offices of the 102-year-old paper were bombed last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we'll be able to continue operating in the city of Medellin 
under the circumstances," said Luis Gabriel Cano, president of the paper's 
editorial board. He was in Monterrey, Mexico, for a media conference. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were injured by the overnight bombings in Bogota, Barranquilla 
and Pereira, police said. There were no indications whether the bombings were 
connected with Gen. Thurman's visit, which included a meeting Monday with 
President Virgilio Barco Vargas and Gen. Miguel Maza, commander of the 
Administrative Security Department, the government investigative police, the 
U.S. Embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy described the meeting as routine. Thurman left Bogota on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bombings Monday evening and early Tuesday included nine in Bogota that 
injured eight people. Police said a man who planted one of the bombs was killed 
in a shoot-out with police. 
</P>
<P>
Three bombs exploded and two were defused in Pereira, a police spokesman said. 
He said an explosion in a lottery ticket office wounded 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Barranquilla said one bomb exploded but no one was injured.

PONTIFF PRAISES RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY AND GIVES A PEP TALK TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC

<P>
Pope John Paul II called on local Roman Catholic priests Tuesday to show 
courage in adversity, and he told leaders of the Muslim majority in Indonesia 
that religious freedom is a fundamental human right. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope's remarks underlined the sensitive position of Christian churches in 
the world's most populous Muslim nation. But Vatican sources said he intended 
them in a global sense. 
</P>
<P>
Although practical problems abound, the sources said, Indonesian bishops have 
conveyed no sense or fear of persecution in their meetings with the Pope. 
Indonesian Catholics, many of them ethnic Chinese, are a minority within an 11% 
Christian minority in this officially secular nation of 175 million people, of 
whom more than 80% are Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
White-robed John Paul II met Islamic, Buddhist, Hindu and other Indonesian 
religious leaders in a park Tuesday after a morning Mass in Jogjakarta, about 
an hour by air from this capital of the island nation that sprawls across 3,000 
miles of ocean. More than 100,000 attended the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to express my hope that Indonesia's religious believers will take the 
lead in showing what profound respect for others can foster in doing harmony 
among the diverse people of this nation," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the fifth most populous nation on Earth and one of the world's 
largest petroleum exporters, consists of 13,677 islands peopled by 10 ethnic 
groups. The residents speak 200 languages in addition to the official language, 
which is related to Malay. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, saying there is strength in diversity, told his "distinguished 
friends" that freedom of worship is essential for all. 
</P>
<P>
"Religious freedom is indeed a fundamental human right, one which should be 
enjoyed by all religious communities, as well as individuals," he said. "Hence, 
it is very important that this right be protected." 
</P>
<P>
Amid a growing Muslim orthodoxy in some parts of Indonesia, the national 
legislature is debating two bills that would alarm Christian communities if 
enacted into law. 
</P>
<P>
One would give civil authority to Muslim courts in cases in which disputants 
agree to be bound by their decision. The other would require instruction in 
Islam in all Indonesian schools, including those run by Protestants and 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic schools, in particular, have been among the most prestigious in the 
archipelago since the days when Indonesia was a Dutch colonial possession. Five 
of President Suharto's 41 Cabinet ministers are Catholic, and a number of 
others were educated in Catholic schools. Collectively, they are known as "the 
Berkeley Mafia" because a third of them went to college in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul II called for a "respectful dialogue" of both words and deeds among 
all of Indonesia's religions. He said that together they can contribute to 
building "a society of cooperation, tolerance and unity." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking later to Catholic priests and nuns, the Pope cautioned that "in order 
that your witness may be credible, your lives must radiate joy and courage even 
in the face of adversity." 
</P>
<P>
Catholic bishops have complained that local officials and Muslim communities 
are often less tolerant of minority faiths than the Indonesian constitution 
requires. In matters ranging from building permits to visas for missionaries, 
the bureaucracy is particularly uncooperative, Indonesian Christians say. The 
Pope, noting a growth in the number of Indonesian priests from 800 to 1,100 in 
the last seven years, urged priests to be steadfast to their vows of dedication 
and moral integrity. 
</P>
<P>
"Your churches today continue to need holy and wise priests who are able to 
show the right path, however daunting or difficult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, John Paul II will undertake a long journey to an afternoon Mass in the 
small agricultural city of Maumere on the island of Flores. From there, he will 
travel Thursday to a Mass in Catholic East Timor, a disputed former Portuguese 
possession in extreme eastern Indonesia, a few hundred miles from Darwin, 
Australia.

A rocket hit a crowded bus station in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Tuesday, 
killing 23 people and injuring an undetermined number, Radio Kabul reported. 
</P>
<P>
The official radio, monitored in Islamabad, described a grisly scene of blood, 
fragmented bodies and people crying. 
</P>
<P>
It said five surface-to-surface rockets in all hit Kabul on Tuesday, the eve of 
the Afghan celebration of the birth of the Muslim prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
"People, including children, women and old men, were returning home from work 
or shopping" when the rocket exploded, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the rocket was fired "most probably" by mercenaries helping Muslim 
guerrillas fighting to topple the Soviet-backed, Communist Afghan government. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad said an estimated 2 
million people in Kabul face a winter of scarce food and fuel unless the 
Communist government changes its priority of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most of a massive 
Soviet airlift to the city consists of weapons instead of food. Western 
diplomats reported a similar situation in autumn, 1988, followed by a severe 
food shortage.

PANEL OF FLORIDA SENATE REJECTS ABORTION LIMITS; 
</P>

LEGISLATURE: TIGHTER CLINIC STANDARDS IS ONLY PROPOSAL THAT APPEARS TO HAVE A 
CHANCE OF PASSAGE.

Shortly after convening a special session on abortion Tuesday, the Florida 
Legislature dealt setbacks to four restrictive measures sought by Gov. Bob 
Martinez in the first test of a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing states to 
impose greater limits on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Amid swirls of demonstrations by anti-abortion and abortion rights advocates 
competing to gain national momentum on the emotional issue, the Senate Health 
and Rehabilitative Services Committee voted 9 to 3 to kill three of the four 
bills containing the governor's proposals by 8:20 p.m. A fourth bill was 
defeated on an 8-4 vote 30 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
One would have prohibited public hospitals from performing abortions or public 
employees from offering abortion counseling, one of several Missouri 
restrictions upheld by the Supreme Court in its Webster decision July 3 
expanding state regulatory powers. 
</P>
<P>
Another bill would have required that a woman seeking an abortion be counseled 
on the risks of the procedure and the condition of the fetus -- an "informed 
consent" restriction declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1985 but 
possibly given new life by the Webster ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The third would have mirrored another part of the Missouri law, barring an 
abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy if a doctor determined that the fetus 
could survive outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth bill would have created a state center to promote adoption as an 
alternative to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Another Martinez proposal, tightening abortion clinic standards, appeared to be 
the only one that stood a chance of passage in the scheduled four-day session. 
Key legislators on both sides of the issue struck a deal on the clinic matter 
Tuesday but then abandoned it, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice Sen. Jeanne Malchon of St. Petersburg, chairman of the Senate Health 
Care Committee, at first agreed to a modest strengthening of clinic regulations 
in exchange for a promise by leading anti-abortion Sen. Richard H. Langley of 
Clermont that no other restrictions would pass the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
However, the deal blew up when anti-abortion groups demanded the chance to 
press for more meaningful restrictions -- and abortion rights groups refused to 
give Martinez an opportunity to salvage victory in his high-stakes gamble to 
boost a 1990 reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
But Martinez's chief lobbyist, Pete Dunbar, expressed guarded optimism that a 
clinic regulation measure might emerge. 
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, everybody said we were going to be gaveled down on everything," 
Dunbar said in an interview. "Now we have significant movement from a 
pro-choice committee chairman." 
</P>
<P>
Malchon's committee will vote on several clinic regulation proposals today. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Bob Crawford and House Speaker Tom Gustafson, both pro-choice 
Democrats, continued attacking the session as a waste of time but conceded that 
key committees are closely divided on the clinic regulation issue. Support for 
ensuring clinic safety grew rapidly after a recent Miami Herald expose 
described a Miami facility with many botched abortions and an unlicensed 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
Many legislators said they thought that some other Martinez proposals had been 
ruled out of bounds by a Florida Supreme Court decision last week. It held that 
the state's strict privacy provision in its constitution granted broad 
protection to women choosing to terminate pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The House is waiting to see what the Senate does before moving into action. 
Many representatives said they hope the Senate would kill all the bills so that 
no one would have to cast a vote on the politically volatile issue. 
</P>
<P>
Raucous demonstrators -- about 10,000 abortion rights and 7,000 anti-abortion, 
police estimated -- staged marches and rallies and swarmed through Capitol 
corridors, serving notice that other state battlegrounds can expect similar 
spectacles in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe these legislators realize we are through being lethargic about this 
issue," said Pierre Duelz of Ft. Lauderdale at a moonlit anti-abortion rally in 
the Capitol plaza Monday night. "If they do nothing, we'll replace them." 
</P>
<P>
In the waiting room of Martinez's office Tuesday, several pro-choice 
demonstrators from Tampa were protesting the position of their former mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"As Florida goes, you're going to see the nation go," Mary Kaplan declared. 
"The eyes of the country are on us."

TOTAL REPEAL OF CATASTROPHIC CARE IS SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The No. 3 Democrat in the House predicted Tuesday that the catastrophic health 
care law will be repealed because the House will not accept a pared-down 
version unanimously approved by the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted, 73 to 26, against repealing the hotly controversial law and 
instead then unanimously passed a compromise plan to retain coverage for 
hospital bills of Medicare recipients. The compromise, authored by Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), also would kill a surtax on benefit recipients. 
</P>
<P>
But on the House side, Majority Whip William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) said: "I do 
not see the votes for the McCain plan." Gray was among 360 representatives who 
voted last week to repeal the catastrophic coverage plan, even though the House 
had voted support in both 1987 and 1988. According to Congressional Quarterly, 
151 Democrats and 44 Republicans who originally favored the law changed their 
minds and voted to scuttle it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Gray's remarks indicate that even the belated Senate effort to rescue 
parts of the package appear doomed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to wipe the slate clean," he told a breakfast meeting of reporters 
about the largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception in 
1965. Gray acknowledged that it may take years for Congress to adopt a 
replacement because of the strong backlash against the financing of the 
catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that the Senate had voted nearly 3 to 1 against repeal, Gray shot 
back: "The Senate has been known to be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Gray noted pointedly that the House Democratic leadership did not take a 
position on the catastrophic health care law, well aware that almost 200 
Democrats in the House were prepared to scrap it. 
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the Senate-approved bill would be defeated in the House just 
as an alternative plan presented by Reps. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) and Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles) was defeated by a vote of 269 to 156 last week. 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reducing capital gains taxes, Gray said that there is no hope 
of changing the outcome even if the House votes a second time. The Democratic 
leadership opposes the capital gains cut advocated by President Bush but the 
cut passed the House after a number of Democrats defected to the Administration 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise being discussed in the Senate, the capital gains provision 
would be removed from a House-passed budget reconciliation bill and therefore 
would have to be approved by the House again and sent back to the Senate. But 
the outcome, Gray said, will not change. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is lost in terms of the House," Gray said. "More than 60 Democrats 
already have voted for it, so how can they explain how they changed their minds 
less than a month later?" 
</P>
<P>
Gray minimized the long-term impact of the loss for House Democratic leaders, 
however, noting that Bush is a first-term President with high popularity and 
had made a cut in capital gains a top campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to roll you on any issue he wants," Gray said. "We lost a battle, 
but not the war." 
</P>
<P>
But Gray acknowledged that Bush presents a difficult target for Democrats 
because he has moved to compromise on such issues as Central American policy, 
budget funding decisions, the savings and loan bailout and his drug program. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is not a target like Ronald Reagan was," Gray told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress had said they were flooded with letters, phone calls and 
demands at town meetings from constituents that led to last week's moves to end 
the tax and many benefits. While some congressmen reported large amounts of 
mail continuing Tuesday after a three-day holiday over Columbus Day, others 
said letters had tapered off. 
</P>
<P>
Some reported the letters and phone calls nearly duplicated an uproar in 1983 
when Congress bowed to public pressure and repealed a proposed income tax 
witholding on interest and dividend income that had been passed the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
A House-Senate conference committee will meet on the fate of the controversial 
law providing catastrophic health care for the elderly. It could repeal the 
plan entirely, as the House voted to do. Or it could scale it back, as the 
Senate did when it voted to keep the hospital care benefit. No date has been 
set for the meeting.

U.S. EAST COAST SHIVERS WITH RECORD LOWS

<P>
Canadian air chilled the East Coast on Tuesday, tying or shattering temperature 
records in nine cities, while a stalled storm front produced up to a foot of 
rain and flooding in parts of eastern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, 
Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina fell to new lows or tied previous 
records for the day, weather officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Columbia, S.C., where a chilly Oct. 10 has become something of a habit, it 
was the third straight year in which the morning low tied the record low for 
the date, 38 degrees, first set in 1895. It was 23 degrees in Concord, N.H., 
tying a record set in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northwest, high winds in advance of a Pacific storm front kicked up dust 
and knocked down power lines in the eastern part of Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed three small grass and timber fires near Spokane on power lines 
downed by 40-m.p.h. gusts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, torrential rain caused flash floods in some eastern areas of 
Florida, prompting several evacuations and road closings, authorities said. 
Rainfall ranging from six inches to more than a foot fell in some spots of St. 
Johns County and the historic city of St. Augustine, south of Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
Les Stern, a spokesman with the St. John's Sheriff Department, said an 
estimated 15 inches of rain fell in the area from Monday night into Tuesday, 
causing flooding in low-lying areas and prompting the closing of some streets.

ZSA ZSA'S LESSON IN JAILHOUSE VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are not merely using video cameras to record demonstrations and other 
potentially explosive events where their actions may be challenged. The cameras 
also have become part of the everyday fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
When Los Angeles sheriff's detectives are called to a murder scene, no longer 
does a still photographer join them to snap shots of the body, footprints, etc. 
"All our homicide teams now have video cameras," said Cmdr. Ray Morris. "I 
won't say we've totally eliminated the photographer (but) we use them very 
infrequently." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the traditional tape recorder is being pushed aside by the new 
technology when it's time to record a suspect's confession or the death-bed 
testimony of a witness. It's much more effective for a jury to see the witness' 
face, as well as hear his words. 
</P>
<P>
Lighter, portable video equipment also has made it easier for police to play 
"Candid Camera" in their periodic stings, such as one in Anaheim this year in 
which 105 suspects were recorded selling nearly $1.4 million in stolen goods to 
undercover officers posing as fences. 
</P>
<P>
At the Beverly Hills police station, two mounted cameras have videotaped all 
bookings since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After Zsa Zsa Gabor portrayed herself at her recent cop-slapping trial as a 
woman offended by vulgar language, prosecutors were able to show the jury a 
tape of her saying angrily into a jailhouse telephone: "The (expletive) 
policeman picked me up and pulled me out of the car!" 
</P>
<P>
The videotapes, kept for two years, are designed to protect the public from 
mistreatment and "us from false claims," Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Curtis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the decreasing size and cost (now an average of $940) of camcorders 
has made it easier for police to use them in the field, one legal expert does 
not foresee them ever being a routine part of the equipment carried in every 
patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
"They would need extra people" to man the cameras, said UCLA law professor 
Norman Abrams. "I don't think we're going to reach the point where we'd spend 
the resources to make that possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem, of course, is there are only certain contexts where police can 
use it. . . . Police catching a bank robber or a car thief are not likely to 
videotape it." 
</P>
<P>
They'd be too busy, he noted.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOLS SETTLE SEX HARASSMENT SUIT 
</P>

The Simi Valley Unified School District has negotiated a tentative settlement 
of a lawsuit that accused a high school principal of sexually harassing a staff 
psychologist for two years until she accepted a demotion to escape him, lawyers 
in the case said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys refused to disclose financial terms of the agreement, but the 
psychologist who brought the suit, Sara Kopman-Davis, described the amount as 
"real substantial, especially for a school district." 
</P>
<P>
"Settlement-wise, I'm satisfied, but money isn't what I wanted," said 
Kopman-Davis, who filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "I wanted 
him reprimanded." 
</P>
<P>
The chief defendant, Apollo High School Principal Brad Greene, declined to 
comment. His attorney, J. Jane Fox of Ventura, said he denied all the 
allegations and that the pending settlement should not be considered an 
admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Greene was accused in the lawsuit of making sexually explicit remarks to 
Kopman-Davis as part of an effort to seduce her, of touching and grabbing her, 
and of giving her a poor evaluation in the spring of 1987 after she repeatedly 
rejected him, said her lawyer, Julia Dragojevic.

GRETZKY'S 1,000TH POINT WAS KEY BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Wayne Gretzky edges closer to becoming the most prolific scorer in National 
Hockey League history, it is hard to believe that the Great One's greatness was 
ever in question. But it's true. Gretzky, who needs only eight points to break 
Gordie Howe's scoring record, was in the league five years before he was 
considered something more than an upstart. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough probably occurred on Dec. 19, 1984, when Gretzky was playing 
for the Edmonton Oilers against the Kings. He had a good night -- two goals and 
four assists -- as the Oilers won, 7-3, and it was on Gretzky's first shift 
that his assist on teammate Mike Krushelnyski's goal gave Gretzky his 1,000th 
NHL point. 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski, who is also a King and was playing on Gretzky's line until being 
sidelined with a hairline fracture of his left wrist, said he doesn't remember 
the goal, but he remembers the record and Gretzky's shot hitting the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Wayne break to the net and I was just going over to congratulate him 
after he scored," Krushelnyski said at the time. "But I happened to follow him 
in after he missed the shot and I went for the rebound. It went off my skate 
and into the net." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were prepared for the moment. Gretzky's family was at the game, and 
a ceremony marked the occasion. Gretzky said it was the most satisfying 
milestone in his career because of skepticism about his talent. 
</P>
<P>
Then, even though he had been named an all-star the previous three years, 
Gretzky was considered by many to be a slow skater and too small. These critics 
also saw him as an offensive-minded center who was loath to pitch in on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Quinn, who was the Kings' coach in '84 and is now the general manager of 
the Vancouver Canucks, said much of the league didn't see Gretzky play often 
enough to get beyond some easy stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in Philadelphia (coaching the Flyers), I would get scouting reports 
that said he was a little bit of a hanger," Quinn said. "They said he was slow. 
Of course, now we know better. I think that 1,000 points won some of the 
skeptics over." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said Gretzky is so subtle on the ice that he can dominate a game in a 
discreet way. "What Wayne does is so cerebral, he is getting your defense out 
of position and you don't even know it," Quinn said. "Much of what he does, or 
did then, was not that apparent. I think that's why it took longer for him to 
get recognition. A lot of nights as a coach, you'd look down on the sheet and 
he had five points. And you'd think, 'How in the hell did that happen?' 
</P>
<P>
Joining the 1,000-point club, and doing it faster than anyone before him, also 
served to open the possibility that Gretzky was capable of breaking all the 
scoring records, even Gordie Howe's sacred 1,850 career points. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people may have seen it as a breakthrough," said Chris Baker, who covered 
the Kings for The Times that year. "But I think it was determined long before 
that night. It was just a matter of time and if he would stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski said those who criticized Gretzky in the early years must not have 
seen him play. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people must not know anything about the game of hockey," he said. "We in 
Edmonton knew how good he was, from the start. I knew, playing with him. I knew 
how hard he worked and what he did in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, now all of that is a given. Gretzky's size hasn't hampered him, and 
few skaters can catch him from behind. 
</P>
<P>
The points are still coming, although he says that the first 1,000 seemed 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are harder, I guess," Gretzky said. "I don't seem to be getting any 
easy ones. Up to 1,800, it seemed I got a bunch of easy ones. One of the things 
I've tried to do in my career is be consistent. I worked hard at it. If I did 
have a bad game, I went out and made sure the next time I had a good one. To 
minimize your bad games is crucial. That's one thing the 1,800 points stands 
for in my mind, consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, whose hapless King teams faced the very consistent Gretzky so often each 
season, laughs now at the idea there was ever skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne makes a little inside move that used to get my defensemen every time," 
Quinn said. "I used to get on them about it. He's still doing that move and 
still faking all the defensemen in the league. There must be something special 
about it. I wish I'd known that then."

After five days of practicing long hours in stuffy Otto Klum Gymnasium, the 
Lakers will open an eight-game exhibition schedule tonight at 10:30, PDT, 
against the Sacramento Kings at Blaisdell Center. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Riley said forward Orlando Woolridge, whose sore right knee was 
drained again Monday night, will not play tonight but probably will play in 
Thursday night's game against the Kings here. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Woolridge's knee) swells up again Friday after Pat plays him on Thursday, 
then we will send him to see Dr. (Robert) Kerlan and probably (perform 
arthroscopic surgery) to find out if there is an underlying cause to the 
swelling," Laker trainer Gary Vitti said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will return to Los Angeles early Friday morning before flying the 
same day to Knoxville, Tenn., to play the New Jersey Nets Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he plans to keep all 15 players throughout the exhibition season 
before determining his 12-player roster. At least during the first two 
exhibition games, Riley said he will remove his veteran players "at the first 
sign of fatigue."

THOMPSON BECOMES MAN IN MIDDLE; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: WITH NO CLEAR HEIR APPARENT TO KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, L.A. CAN NO LONGER 
AFFORD TO USE THE VETERAN IN BACKUP ROLE.

<P>
Do not believe Mychal Thompson when he says the racing stripe that passes for 
his new haircut was designed by physicists for maximum running speed with 
minimum wind resistance. 
</P>
<P>
He did it, Laker players suspect, simply for shock value and to defy fashion 
modes. 
</P>
<P>
Humor him when Thompson claims that any serious golfer would drive off with a 
bucket of balls in his car if he were too busy to finish up at the driving 
range. At least, that is what Thompson told police in Lake Oswego, Ore., last 
summer when they cited him for doing it. 
</P>
<P>
And dismiss totally Thompson's oft-proclaimed desire to become prime minister 
of his native Bahamas. Any further encouragement would only perpetuate his 
delusions. 
</P>
<P>
But when the veteran center objects mildly to the growing prospect that he will 
be Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's replacement as the Lakers' starting center, believe 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Abdul-Jabbar's farewell tour last season and all summer, Thompson 
has maintained that he is content as the Lakers' backup center-power forward, 
top quotesmith and resident jokester. 
</P>
<P>
Despite General Manager Jerry West's efforts to acquire a starting center by a 
trade, free-agent signing or any means short of kidnaping, the Lakers have not 
bagged one. Yugoslav import Vlade Divac is considered a project; Mark McNamara 
seems born to be a backup. So that, by default, leaves Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
The joke, it turns out, may be on him. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Thompson finds himself paired with the four established Laker starters 
in training-camp workouts, reality has set in. So, he has backed off a bit on 
his previous denial that he will be the starting center. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the job, sure I'll take it and do a good job with it," Thompson 
said. "I wasn't expecting to be the starting center. I just want us to get 
another big body because we need somebody to take Kareem's place. We haven't 
done that yet. Whether it's a starter or somebody backing me up, I hope they 
get him. "I don't care who they bring in here. If Jerry can bring in Rick 
Mahorn, that would be great. You can never have enough big guys. The Pistons 
proved that against us last year." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson averaged 24.9 minutes a game last season, compared with 22.9 for 
Abdul-Jabbar. In eight games in December when Thompson started in place of the 
injured Abdul-Jabbar, the Lakers went 7-1. In those games, Thompson averaged 
13.6 points and 7.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Thompson averaged 9.2 points and 5.8 rebounds and led the Lakers by 
making 55.9% of his shots, but there were games when he did not make the 
desired impact off the bench. For example, Thompson did not reach double 
figures in rebounding in any of the Lakers' last 31 regular-season games. But 
he did respond in the playoffs, leading Laker reserves in scoring and 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with added responsibility, Thompson said he will strive to be more 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebounding is my number one priority this year," Thompson said, "to help A.C. 
(Green) and James (Worthy) out on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Thompson does not foresee a drastic change in his game. Riley, 
however, said the Lakers will run more now that Abdul-Jabbar is no longer 
anchored in the low post as the last option on offense. 
</P>
<P>
So far in training camp, Riley has put a greater emphasis on what he terms the 
club's "spread" offense, in which the center and power forward begin the plays 
near midcourt and break down the defense to a two-on-two challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Kareem was a back-to-the-basket center, and that habit has been ingrained in 
our offense for 10 years," Riley said. "We will find out this year how best to 
utilize the five spot (center) in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to run like we've never run before, with or without Mychal at 
center. This is a challenge for Mychal: Now, in the twilight of his career, to 
make a greater impact. He can play 30 minutes (a game). That's only six more 
than last season. He can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said the team is not in a holding pattern at center. He said that since 
centers are a precious commodity these days and the Lakers are not in an ideal 
bargaining position, he has to proceed as if Thompson is the heir to 
Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
"He's number one on the depth chart," Riley said. "I think Mychal T. wants 
this. And I think we can win with him starting." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson thinks so, too. He says he has the mobility to be a center on a 
running team where he is not required to burrow himself continually into the 
low post. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a wide-open game now with us, a combination of the Denver Nuggets 
and Golden State Warriors," Thompson said. "A passing game, a lot of movement, 
a lot of pick and rolls. We'll rely more now on quickness, agility and overall 
court awareness. That's right up our alley. The athletes we have, these guys 
are all great in the open court. It's good to take advantage of our skills. 
</P>
<P>
"The center position is overplayed. Sure, it doesn't hurt to have an Akeem 
Olajuwon or a Patrick Ewing. But they are the best centers in the league, and 
how many titles have they won the last five years? It doesn't hurt to have 
those guys, but you've got to have a whole team, not just a guy in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with starting Thompson is that the Lakers figure to miss the boost 
he often provided off the bench. Thompson said that if Divac, the 21-year-old 
Yugoslav star, develops quickly, the Laker bench will be strong up front. 
</P>
<P>
"If they use Mark or Vlade behind me, they don't lose much of anything off the 
bench," Thompson said. "I know it doesn't hurt having me (come off the bench). 
I know they like the (substitution pattern) they've been used to the last three 
years. That would be nice (again). 
</P>
<P>
"But it looks like anyone who has a decent center doesn't want to give him up 
to us. They are blackballing the Lakers, like the Raiders. We've had too much 
success, and teams don't want to help us stay on top." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest Laker at 34, Thompson said his goal is to stay in the league another 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With the prospect of an added workload, Thompson probably will increase his 
daily dosage of ginseng, the herbal oriental stimulant that he says has 
restorative powers, as well as stay longer in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
"I take care of myself," Thompson said. "I get the proper nourishment. This is 
my prime. I'm 34, but I really don't feel my age. I know I don't act it." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's eventful summer seems to prove that. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the publicized golf-ball heist at a driving range near 
Thompson's home in suburban Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, an avid golfer, said he stopped by the local course to hit a few, but 
after purchasing a bucket, he realized he was late for an appointment. Instead 
of returning the balls, Thompson said he put them in his car with every 
intention of coming back later to hit them. 
</P>
<P>
The operators of the driving range called the police, but charges were dropped, 
Thompson said, before the case came to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a misunderstanding, not a crime," Thompson said. "Charges were 
dropped. A lot of golfers do that. If you don't have time to hit a full bucket 
of balls, you keep 'em and come back later. They thought I wouldn't come back. 
Mainly, it was overreaction by the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny at first, until it made the press. Then, it really ticked me off, 
because it could ruin your reputation." 
</P>
<P>
But it only enhanced Thompson's eccentric reputation. He was kidded by 
teammates, and public relations director Josh Rosenfeld wrote in the team's 
media guide that Thompson has started collecting old golf balls in his spare 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe to divert attention from the golf ball issue, Thompson arrived in 
training camp last week with his unusual hair style. Both sides of Thompson's 
head have been shaved to the nub, and on top is a strip of full-grown hair 
stretching from his forehead to the back of the neck. It looks as if Thompson 
wanted to shave his head, a la Abdul-Jabbar, then changed his mind at the last 
moment. Either that, or the barber used hedge clippers instead of a razor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a trend-setter, an individualist in a team game," Thompson said, by way of 
explanation. "It has less wind resistance this way, makes me look younger and 
feel younger. It's the new me -- a new identity." 
</P>
<P>
Even without the wolverine look on his head, Thompson may wind up with that new 
identity as the Lakers' reluctant starting center.

CLIPPERS ADD WEIGHT INCENTIVE TO BENJAMIN'S CONTRACT OFFER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers' latest proposal to holdout center Benoit Benjamin Tuesday 
included something of a surprise, although it probably shouldn't have been 
under the circumstances: a weight clause. 
</P>
<P>
While offering a one-year deal at the original amount of $1.25 million and 
retaining an option for the second, the Clippers added a condition that 
Benjamin can receive an undisclosed bonus if he stays under 255 pounds. He will 
not be fined for going over, the idea being an incentive to stay trim. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said he weighs 275, but is only about 10 pounds too heavy. After a 
summer of working out with weights and a personal trainer, he said he can play 
at 260 or 265. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper General Counsel Alan Rothenberg had not received a response to the 
proposal from Benjamin's agent, Henry Holmes, by Tuesday evening. SCOTT

HE DIDN'T LET THE GAME GET PAST HIM;

<P>
TENNIS: IN THE WHEELCHAIR GAME, TOP-RANKED RANDY SNOW IS A CUT ABOVE THE REST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If I woke up tomorrow and God said, "You've done your time, here are your legs 
back," I'd have to say, "But I've got a wheelchair tennis tournament coming up 
in Lake Tahoe. Can I do that first?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- RANDY SNOW, the No. 1-ranked wheelchair tennis player in the world 
</P>
<P>
Gathered in a semicircle, the wheelchair tennis players at the Racquet Club of 
Irvine form an amphitheater of sorts for Randy Snow. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the parts of you that know how to play tennis, play tennis," he says. 
"Don't clutter your mind. And, most important, don't beat yourself down." 
</P>
<P>
Lessons in tennis or lessons in life? 
</P>
<P>
Snow insists there are no heavy messages here, it's just another tennis clinic 
in progress during a break in the action at the U.S. Open wheelchair tennis 
championships, known affectionately as Wheelchair Wimbledon. Just some drills, 
some strategy, and, sure, a little psychology. 
</P>
<P>
After all, don't all tennis coaches throw in heavy doses of psychology? 
</P>
<P>
Snow figures most of these players don't need motivational pep talks, anyway. 
He thinks the majority of them are going through life better than most. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to watch us play, he says, that's great. But leave the sympathy in 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man at peace with himself and his lot in life. He's as comfortable 
wheeling through an international airport as he is ripping a cross-court, 
topspin backhand. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he remembers what it was like in the beginning. He remembers what it 
feels like to be a 16-year-old nationally ranked junior tennis player with a 
broken back. 
</P>
<P>
A ranching accident left Snow a paraplegic 14 years ago. And the first time 
that wheelchair-bound teen-ager rolled out onto the tennis court in the back 
yard of his family's home, he cried. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when he's on the court, he grunts, sweats, exults . . . and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Having a 1,000-pound bale of hay land on your back and render your legs useless 
is the kind of nightmare that only happens to someone else. If you spent your 
life worrying about such things, you'd never get out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
Snow is convinced, however, that if people knew how good life on wheels can be, 
they wouldn't lose any sleep fretting, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing worse than the Florence Nightingales who fawn over you," he 
said, grimacing. "If you want to help me, show me how to improve my backhand. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't understand that this made me something. I was a nobody in a 
blase world. This taught me a lesson about never taking things for granted. 
That may be a cliche, but it's a lesson some people never learn. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you have your bad days. Everybody gets down. But, hey, people pay me to 
travel all over the world to play tennis! That accident gave me this life. It 
made me somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Randy Snow is somebody. To folks on spokes, he's almost a legend: an 
Olympic silver medalist, a former world record-holder and a role model for 
everyone whose life was changed overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Snow said he recovered from the initial shock of his accident rather quickly 
and that it wasn't until he matured a bit that the inevitable depression began 
to envelop him, like an early-morning fog. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought I was OK," he said. "I said to myself, 'Well, I can still 
do this and still do that.' I got back into high school and for a couple of 
years, I just partied a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"But then it hit me that I was going to be in this chair forever." 
</P>
<P>
So he ventured back on the tennis court at home, and hated it. Some friends got 
him to try wheelchair basketball. He hated that, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible," he said. "They were making us do wind sprints and laps 
around the gym. "I thought, 'I'm in a wheelchair and I gotta do this?' So I 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
But by 1979, four years after the accident, Snow found himself "craving a life 
fix." He was now physically better equipped to handle the chair so he gave 
basketball another chance. The second time, he got hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finally got into wheelchair sports, I couldn't get enough," he said. 
"After that, the sports started coming in waves. I was going to school at the 
University of Texas, but I couldn't concentrate on school work. All I could 
think about was wheelchair sports." 
</P>
<P>
His first successes were in track events. Shortly after he learned that 
national competition existed, he was competing and winning. In the 1979 
Wheelchair Games in New York, he won a bronze medal in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
And he really had yet to train much. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an athlete again," Snow said, smiling. "And I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Snow set a national record and a world record. He was training now 
and, like any other world-class athlete, that meant training full-time, pushing 
himself up to 20 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
The work was worth it, though. Later that year, he realized the goal of every 
track athlete, competing in the 1,500-meter exhibition wheelchair race in the 
1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole two weeks was like a dream," Snow said. "Words can't begin to 
describe it." 
</P>
<P>
Millions saw it on television. More than 80,000 saw it with their own eyes, but 
only a handful of young men in wheelchairs had a view like Randy Snow's. 
</P>
<P>
"The 4-by-100 relay semis had just finished and Carl Lewis, who trained at the 
same track I did in Houston, came over and shook my hand," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty high." 
</P>
<P>
With 100 meters to go, Snow was in seventh place. He made up enough ground to 
finish second to Paul Van Winkle of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Snow was reminded that the view from the victory stand looks just 
as good when you're sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
Snow and San Clemente's Brad Parks, the founder of wheelchair tennis, will 
probably renew their decade-long battle for the singles title at this year's 
U.S. Open wheelchair tournament. 
</P>
<P>
No one else has won it in the 10-year history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Snow won in 1981, '82, '83, '84, '86 and '88. Parks took the title in 1980, '85 
and '87. 
</P>
<P>
"As hard as it is to admit -- because I'm so competitive -- Brad is my role 
model," Snow said. "I saw him play once and that made me decide to give tennis 
another chance." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, success is that much sweeter the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of funny, but I play better tennis now. I could easily have beaten 
myself. We're not Lendl and Becker, out here. We play tennis more like the 
chess game it is. But this is no invalid sport. Show a weakness and we attack 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Snow, who works as a recreation therapist at the Lakeshore Rehabilitation 
Complex in Birmingham, Ala., when he's not touring the world playing and 
teaching wheelchair tennis, says he helps others deal with catastrophic 
accidents by showing them that partial paralysis doesn't have to mean 
inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, working legs are nice, but not necessarily a key to happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sort of backed up to the simplicity of life," he said. "I used to worry 
about what people thought and everything working out the way I wanted it to. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to realize that the most important thing is to enjoy what you have." 
</P>
<P>
Snow happens to have a wicked down-the-line forehand with lots of pace. So he 
wheeled off to enjoy it.

NEWSWIRE: $11.2 MILLION AWARDED FOR INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former high school football player in Portland, Ore., has been awarded $11.2 
million from a jury that concluded a defective football helmet caused him to 
suffer a severe brain injury four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A helmet made by Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably dangerous, leading to acute 
bleeding within the brain of Richard Austria, then 16, a jury in Multnomah 
County Circuit Court decided by an 11-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Austria, 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical impairments resulting 
from an acute subdural hematoma he suffered Oct. 1, 1985. The condition results 
from bleeding in the brain caused by the force of a blow.

JOHNSON WINS TOUGHEST FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Amy Johnson, the opposition on the field has always been the smallest 
obstacle she has had to face in her career with the Cal Poly Pomona women's 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the team as a freshman, the 20-year-old forward has consistently 
been among the top players for the Broncos. Last season, as a sophomore, she 
was Pomona's leading scorer and was chosen to the second team of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division II All-American squad. She is already 
among the school's all-time leaders in goals, points and assists. 
</P>
<P>
But for the 5-foot-5 Johnson, the toughest fight hasn't been with the 
competition, but with herself. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered from bulimia, an eating disorder found primarily in younger women 
who see themselves as overweight, or likely to become overweight. Those so 
afflicted commonly ingest large quantities of food, then make themselves vomit 
in order to remain thin. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said her problems stemmed from the perception she had of herself while 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted to be Miss America at one time but she was too short," said Pomona 
Coach Brian Wiesner, who wrote the thesis for his master's degree on eating 
disorders in female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
For as long as she could remember, Johnson said, she had been concerned about 
her weight, although it was not until after graduating from Corona High School 
that signs of the disorder first surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably between my senior year in high school and my freshman year in 
college, but I wouldn't really call it bulimia," she said. "At this time, it 
was more like excessive dieting. In my fall semester and freshman season, I 
didn't really start throwing up. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the soccer season was when it got really bad. I always thought I 
was real heavy, so I started dieting a lot." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Johnson said, staying thin had become a dangerous obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"I would just try to please my friends by eating a meal and then I would go to 
the nearest bathroom and purge it all after I ate," she said. Although Johnson 
often purged before games, Wiesner said he didn't detect a problem during her 
freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't lose a thing in the way she played on the field," he said. "Her 
performance for us has been super all along. So it was something that was 
really more noticeable when she wasn't playing." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said it wasn't until the spring quarter of her freshman year that he 
noticed a change in Johnson's appearance and weight. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to tell that Amy wasn't up to par, but I didn't know why," Wiesner 
said. "Then her friends (from the team) started calling me up and telling me 
what she was doing. I didn't know what to do. . . . I had to work with our 
training staff on it because we didn't know how to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
After he became aware of the problem, Wiesner said, he assigned players to 
monitor Johnson's eating habits, only to be met with resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had people watching her every day, and she'd come up to me and say, 'I don't 
want people spying on me,' " Wiesner said. 
</P>
<P>
It was toward the end of the spring quarter that Wiesner and school trainers 
finally confronted Johnson with the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Johnson agreed to meet with Gayle Ashabraner, then a 
nutritional counselor at the school's health center, who put Johnson on a diet. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesner said Johnson's typical playing weight is about 123 pounds and she had 
lost 20 pounds by the time she met with Ashabraner. Johnson was also constantly 
out of breath and had puffy cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Brian that I'd (meet Ashabraner) but I didn't want to gain any weight," 
Johnson said. "She asked me what my ideal weight was, and I said about 105 
pounds. She said, 'If you trust me, I'll guarantee that you weigh that.' " 
</P>
<P>
The counselor persuaded Johnson to keep a list of her eating habits. At first, 
she continued her old ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a chart and I'd have to write it down with an asterisk if I 
purged," she said. "There were some days when I did two or three or four times 
and some days when I didn't do it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she finally learned to control her eating habits during the summer 
before her sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
But although Johnson no longer has bulimia, Wiesner said she must always 
monitor her eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not a recovered bulimic, she's a recovering bulimic and she'll always 
have to be concerned about it," he said. "She can always be susceptible to it 
again if the conditions are right." 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge football team won its fourth game in a row by 
outscoring Cal Lutheran, 34-33, Saturday. But the Matadors (4-2) could have 
problems when they visit perennial NCAA Division II power Portland State in a 
Western Football Conference game Saturday at Portland. The Vikings (4-2) rolled 
over Cal Poly San Luis Obispo by a 56-26 score in their last game. . . . It 
will be a matchup of perhaps the top two Division II football teams in Southern 
California when the University of San Diego (5-0) plays Occidental (3-1) in a 
nonconference game Saturday in Eagle Rock. Occidental has won its last three 
games, including a forfeit victory over Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside will play host to the 1989 Rolex Southern California 
Intercollegiate Tennis Championships Friday through Sunday. The tournament will 
include top men and women from NCAA Divisions II and III, NAIA and junior 
colleges.

JACK SMITH: TAKING A DRIVE DOWN A CONGESTED MEMORY LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Courso's remembrance of things past, at 80, has stirred memories in other 
Angelenos. Mostly they have vindicated his memories as on the mark, except that 
the Paramount Theater was at 6th and Hill, not 5th. 
</P>
<P>
Another error was my own. Gilmore Stadium was not, as I recalled, the home of 
the Hollywood Stars. Gilmore Stadium, at Fairfax and Beverly, was the site of 
midget automobile racing and football games (the Los Angeles Bulldogs, Loyola 
University); the home of the Hollywood stars was Gilmore Field, east of the 
stadium near Pan Pacific Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Several readers verify that I was right in remembering that double-decker buses 
ran on Wilshire Boulevard; but Courso was also evidently right that they ran on 
Sunset as well. 
</P>
<P>
M. L. Snellen remembers being on the upper deck of a bus that stopped for a 
traffic light at Wilshire and Vermont. In the street alongside the bus he saw 
Cary Grant at the wheel of a custom Phantom Corsair. "With his customary 
extroverted charm he waved at us." 
</P>
<P>
"You're right," says Allan Paul of Costa Mesa. "The double-decker buses did run 
on Wilshire, but on Sunset too. Both routes gave the topside rider not just a 
wonderful view but an unforgettable perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Numerous readers have offered answers to my question, "Who was responsible for 
dismantling the Red Cars?" The consensus is that the Pacific Electric 
interurban system of Big Red Cars was cynically trashed by General Motors, 
Standard Oil of California, and Firestone Tires to promote the sale of their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
There certainly is evidence to support that theory. Alf B. Nielsen sends a page 
from the American Heritage History of Railroads in America. It notes that PE 
operated 1,164 miles of track serving more than 50 Southern California 
communities when GM and Standard Oil, through a subsidiary, bought the system, 
"scrapped its electric cars, tore down its power transmission lines, uprooted 
the tracks, and placed GM diesel buses fueled by Standard Oil on Los Angeles 
city streets. Los Angeles' quiet, pollution-free, electric train system was 
totally destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
David I. Lippert sends a Times editorial of May 10, 1979, written by my former 
colleague Phil Kerby, a Pulitzer Prize winner. Kerby observed that "a willing 
society that prized mobility and the family bus above all else made it 
possible, but the motorization of America was not preordained." 
</P>
<P>
He cited a five-year study (published by a Senate committee) whose conclusion 
was that "GM and its auto industry allies severed Los Angeles' regional rail 
links and then motorized its downtown heart." 
</P>
<P>
General Motors replied that the Red Cars were doomed by "the personal 
preferences of the people," but in Chicago a federal jury convicted GM, 
Standard Oil, Firestone and others of conspiring to replace electric 
transportation with buses." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington Post, GM rampaged over America, destroying rail 
transit systems in 45 cities. It quoted the 102-page study prepared for the 
Senate: "Largely as a result (of the conspiracy) Los Angeles is today an 
ecological wasteland. The palm trees are dying of petrochemical smog; the 
orange groves have been paved over by 300 miles of freeways; the air is a 
septic tank into which 4 million cars, half of them built by General Motors, 
pump 13,000 tons of pollutants daily. . . ." (Those figures of course are out 
of date.) 
</P>
<P>
A revisionist view was offered in The Times on Sept. 13, 1987, by Scott L. 
Bottles, a historian and banker. Bottles conceded that GM and its affiliates 
bought up and scrapped numerous rail transit systems and replaced them with 
diesel buses; but he argued that the people were dissatisfied with the rail 
service and that the local company had decided four years earlier to replace 
the electric cars with buses. 
</P>
<P>
As GM had, he blamed Angelenos' love of their automobiles as the reason for the 
change. He said "motorists had to fight the railways for the right to use city 
streets." It was the automobile, he said, not the interurban system, that 
created a decentralized Los Angeles. Unfortunately, he allowed, 
"decentralization and the auto would engender new problems." 
</P>
<P>
He concluded that Angelenos "freely adopted the automobile as their major means 
of transportation" long before GM and its co-conspirators made the automobile's 
primacy inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
So we did it to ourselves, with a little help from our corporate friends. 
</P>
<P>
But I wish we could still ride the Big Red Cars all day Sunday for $1.

Each day after his sixth-grade teaching job, Joe Reed returns home at 2:30 
p.m., eats an early dinner and rushes to the office behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:30, students begin arriving at hourly intervals with problems in math, 
science or English and Reed begins work as an after-school tutor. 
</P>
<P>
Seated behind a desk, he works 50 minutes with each student, helping them with 
their subject matter. But he also secures agreements that if they fail to 
organize their studies or hand in assignments, they will accept penalties 
ranging from no television for a day to being grounded for a weekend. And he 
begins regular contact with their teachers to monitor their progress. 
</P>
<P>
Reed tutors 16-20 students a week, at $30 per session, and often works until 
8:30 p.m. It is a long day, but Reed says he feels unburdened. "Some people 
think this is a heavy schedule," he said. "I consider it a blessing. For 
instance, I had a student last year who went from D's and F's to A's and B's 
and received a special commendation from his school. And when that kid came in 
and showed that to me, it was the greatest joy in the world. I get the kind of 
joy that most people never get." 
</P>
<P>
As this school year's midterm exams begin, Reed is among thousands of tutors 
available to area students and parents, who may call schools, boards of 
education, private learning centers or colleges or universities for such help. 
</P>
<P>
Many schools offer free, on-campus tutoring. The Los Angeles Unified School 
District, for example, provides academic help on most campuses, and the 
Pasadena Unified School District offers free aid for an hour after school at 
all campuses and two satellite locations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents may also hire individual help from experts such as Reed through lists 
kept by schools or boards of education. A San Fernando Valley office of Los 
Angeles Unified -- (818) 997-2304 -- keeps a list of hundreds of tutors. Other 
districts including Burbank -- (818) 846-7121 -- and Santa Monica/Malibu -- 
(213) 450-8338 -- make names available. 
</P>
<P>
The various academic departments at colleges and universities often provide 
names of undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in tutoring. 
Programs such as USC's Upward Bound may bring high school students onto the 
university campus for Saturday-morning tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Be Costly 
</P>
<P>
Educators who work with tutors warn parents to hire carefully. Most school 
districts accept applications but lack resources to check tutors' backgrounds 
or abilities. In addition, tutoring can be costly. Although some college 
students may charge $5 an hour, experienced tutors ask $20-$25, said Charles 
Espalin, director of counseling and guidance services for L.A. Unified. And in 
affluent areas such as Beverly Hills, some command $30 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
"The parent has an obligation to have a good, meaty discussion with the 
prospective tutor," Espalin said. "Have they worked with young people? Have 
they had experience with this age group? What expertise does this person have? 
Are they a former teacher? If they tutor math, were they math majors in 
college? Do they work with math on their job?" 
</P>
<P>
Similar care should be used in selecting a private, profit-oriented learning 
center. "Some of them make interesting promises," Espalin said. "If someone is 
saying that in one year we are going to move your student three or four grade 
levels, as an educator I doubt if that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I would want to take a look at their materials and their methods and the 
training of the people they hire. I would see if they have any testimonials. If 
I were going to sign a one-year contract, I would want to do a fair amount of 
exploration." 
</P>
<P>
Parents should also question teachers before they decide tutors are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Methods 
</P>
<P>
"If people call here, we say please call the school," Espalin said. "Maybe the 
teacher will have an idea about alternative methods, such as reinforcement at 
home. Perhaps all Johnny needs is to read 30 minutes each evening or someone to 
check his multiplication problems. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"At times you have overzealous parents who feel that a B in math is not enough. 
In this case tutoring may not translate into more learning or a higher grade. 
It may translate into frustration or fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"That is why we recommend talking to the teacher," Espalin added. "If there 
appears to be a need for a tutor, the school will help the parent make 
connections with a free program at the school or in the community." 
</P>
<P>
For those who get the help they need, tutoring can be rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Vigil, 13, an eighth grader at Washington Middle School in Pasadena, 
says on-campus tutoring after school helped raised his math and English grades 
from C to B-plus. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lloyd, 15, a Beverly Hills High School sophomore, said that he was 
earning a low C in algebra last year when he hired a private tutor. On his 
final, he received a B-plus. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd worked with Brad Niems, a 1987 UCLA graduate in mathematics who has 
tutored for nine years. Niems, 25, teaches in a private school and tutors about 
15 hours a week, charging $30 to $50 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Understands Concepts' 
</P>
<P>
"He helps you a lot," said Lloyd. "He understands concepts that they don't 
explain in class. He went to Beverly Hills High. He had some of the same 
teachers. If you tell him something, he will know that it could be true. . . . 
Other tutors might not be able to adapt." 
</P>
<P>
Brett Charles, a ninth-grader at John Muir Junior High in Burbank, was earning 
D's and F's when his parents sent him to Reed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Reed persuaded Charles to keep a list of assignments and to maintain folders 
with finished work on one side and unfinished on the other. He also worked with 
Charles' parents so they could help the youngster follow through. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks the brown-haired, 14-year-old was earning A's and B's. He won five 
school commendations including a student-of-the-month award. This year he is 
maintaining his grades while taking English, pre-algebra, world cultures, 
singing in the school choir and playing on the Burbank High School freshman 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my attitude was not right and I wasn't as organized as I should be," 
said Charles. "He made me focus a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't feel school was that important. He just fooled around," said Becky 
Charles, Brett's mother. "Joe turned that around in a hurry. He really 
communicates with Brett."

BOOKS: THE COUNTERCULTURE'S FAVORITE CELEBRITY CATALOGUE HAS JUST ISSUED A 
PHOTOGRAPHIC RETROSPECTIVE. AND THE IMAGES SHOW ROCK 'N' ROLL'S EVOLUTION FROM 
RAW TO REFINED.

<P>
For a while, getting your picture on the cover of Rolling Stone was the new 
American dream. Now that the medium really is the message in our culture, it 
seems as many people dream of getting a photograph they shot on the cover as 
having their own mug appear there. 
</P>
<P>
Like the rock 'n' roll it covers, Rolling Stone has been gathering mainstream 
respectability since Jann S. Wenner launched it as a 24-page, black-and-white 
newspaper in 1967, and celebrity photography has risen to glory in the 
magazine's wake. 
</P>
<P>
A new retrospective of Rolling Stone photographs -- the $50 "Rolling Stone, the 
Photographs" -- is as elegant and artsy a coffee table book as any appearing in 
an Architectural Digest spread. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Rolling Stone into polite society reflects the triumph of the 
renegade culture that the magazine set out to portray. A few observers worry, 
however, that rock 'n' roll's victory was won though a slickly contrived 
iconography that ignores deeper realities. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the aim of Rolling Stone's photographers and photo editors has 
been as grandiose as the budding young stars they caught on film: "to document 
the rise of American youth culture, to capture the rock and roll spirit that 
spilled over into communes, festivals and politics. . . ," publisher Wenner 
writes in his introduction to the book. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wolfe, a regular Rolling Stone contributor, speculates in his preface that 
21st-Century historians will look at the photo collection with relish, as keys 
to the era in which "Americans developed the confidence -- perhaps hubris is 
the word -- to sweep aside standards and constraints that had been in place for 
millennia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I want to do," Wolfe adds, "is to lower the baggage of history 
upon these pictures. As you will see, they have their own special power to 
evoke our gaudy era. The confidence, the impudence, the pell-mell energy, the 
slightly mad freedom -- it's all there staring straight out." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the book is guaranteed to click in the minds of baby boomers, 
triggering key memories of the way we were, or the way we thought we were, or 
the way a handful of photographers and art directors told us we were and tell 
us we are. 
</P>
<P>
Click: Jimi Hendrix kneels before a flaming guitar at the Monterey Pop 
Festival, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Click: Honor guards roll up the red carpet as a helicopter carries Richard 
Nixon away, moments after he resigned as President. 
</P>
<P>
Click: A naked John Lennon wraps himself around a fully clothed Yoko Ono, in a 
photograph that ran just after he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Click: Michael Jackson is a little kid with a big 'fro. 
</P>
<P>
Click: A demonic-looking Alice Cooper is coiled with a serpentine friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Click: George Harrison has decades of thought on his face and gray in his 
beard. 
</P>
<P>
Click: Madonna. Click: Madonna. Click: Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Stone photographers generally agree that if they are propelled by any 
unifying force, it's the freedom to develop their own style -- a liberty 
extended by Laurie Kratochvil, the magazine's photography editor for the past 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
That freedom led Albert Watson, for example, to snap close-ups of Mike Tyson's 
head and neck, front and rear, conveying the boxer's strength with unexpected 
directness. "I think you're always looking for something that's a little 
unusual," Watson said. "You're trying to get a shot that will be memorable in 
five years or 20 years. That will hold on." 
</P>
<P>
In another photograph, Watson and actor Jack Nicholson wandered into a blizzard 
outside the actor's Aspen home. Watson asked the actor to have a seat on a lawn 
chair, but decided the shot would be better if some snow built up on Nicholson. 
"Nicholson said, 'OK. But why don't you go back into the house for 15 minutes." 
Fifteen minutes later, Watson returned and got a peculiar, amusing shot of a 
cold, snow-dappled Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
This sort of control of the photograph and collaboration with the subject 
started with Annie Leibovitz, the photographer most closely associated with the 
Rolling Stone style. It has continued as a dominant force in the years since 
Leibovitz left the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Annie began to view the cover as a blank canvas with its own set of 
possibilities and problems," Wenner writes in his introduction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Photography by Committee' 
</P>
<P>
Not all viewers are entirely impressed with where this sort of photographic 
styling has taken the magazine, though. For Robert Hilburn, the Los Angeles 
Times' rock critic, the Rolling Stone book suggests a trend that approaches 
"photography by committee. It's as if some of these are done as album jackets 
or book covers, rather than -- in the corniest sense -- to seek the soul of the 
artist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baron Wolman, who was Rolling Stone's first staff photographer and is 
represented by several shots in the book, laments that the directness of 
earlier photographs has fallen out of style at the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making a judgment. I think it's interesting what they're doing now," 
he said. "It's just not how I shoot." As an example, he points to a candid shot 
of blues star B. B. King from the book. "That picture of B. B. King captured a 
moment. That was B. B. King being himself, not B. B. King posing for me or 
doing something strange to make a curious image. It was just a backstage 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of candid backstage moments are almost extinct in Rolling Stone and 
most other publications now, said Jim Marshall, who is represented in the book 
by an early shot of Bob Dylan and a picture of Janis Joplin slumped in a 
dressing room with a bottle Southern Comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Such impromptu exposures vanished when artists and their managers began 
demanding more control of the image-making process and photographers and their 
editors began accepting it, some photographers say. Some bands don't allow 
photographers into their concerts at all; others orchestrate their movements as 
if they were part of the act. 
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are much higher now, and with that kind of money at stake, 
everybody is very edgy about everything," Marshall said. So, it's no wonder 
that recent high-profile rock packages have shown "nothing of the gritty end of 
the business. No stuff from hotel rooms. Nothing like that. Now we're seeing 
only what the artists and their managers want us to see. I think we are the 
lesser for it." 
</P>
<P>
E. J. Camp, a regular Rolling Stone contributor who has seven photographs in 
the book, including a moody black-and-white nude of rocker Billy Idol, readily 
admits that "I always feel obliged to a subject to make them look good." 
</P>
<P>
But she doesn't see that compromising the integrity of the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she completes a shoot, she has developed empathy for the person she 
eyes through her viewfinder: "I don't want to make the look vulgar or gritty. I 
want to show their nice qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you should always be digging out some essence of the character in the 
shot," and through an intense interaction with her subject, she evokes a more 
honest portrayal, she believes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many ways to arrive at insight," said Matthew Rolston, who 
contributed some of the most unusual images in the book, including a portrait 
of Madonna in a circus setting, a fiercely erotic nude of actress Lisa Bonet 
and a portrait of George Michael's face within an outline of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the picture of George Michael with the hand has insight, but it gets 
there in different way than the picture of Jimi Hendrix with the flaming guitar 
does," he said. "With the earliest pictures, reportage was the dominant style. 
Now manipulation and stylization are more today. . . . I like reportage too. 
Both are great approaches. . . . But I'm as much a child of my time as they 
were of theirs. There is a war between Realism and Expressionism now, and we're 
living in Expressionist period." 
</P>
<P>
Wenner agrees with this art-reflects-the-times assessment. The sort of 
warts-and-all shots of carousing Rolling Stones that Rolling Stone used to run 
no longer are accurate, he said. Even now, when the magazine portrays a group 
such as the new heavy-metal heroes Guns N' Roses, their hard living shows: 
"It's hard to hide it, it's on their faces." 
</P>
<P>
But today's Stones are more indicative of the epoch, and photographs of the 
band reflect that. "The drunken revelry isn't there," Wenner said. "It's a very 
professional tour, with hair dressers, makeup artists. They don't drink 
anymore, they exercise like mad, and they are all very concerned with their 
appearances."

FLOWER POWER IS BLOOMING IN SPRING LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring, 1990 will send a strong message about '60s style flower power, across 
the fashion world at least. 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio Armani, who opened the Italian spring-summer ready-to-wear shows on 
Sunday with his Emporio line, recalled the original hippie dress code with his 
gypsy skirts and shawls, vests, tattered jeans, oversized shirts and jackets, 
and clumpy sandals. 
</P>
<P>
And he reminded his audience about the "nature girl" ideal that many a flower 
child aspired to when he filled his runway with bare-chested women, attended by 
bare-chested men, all wearing Armani blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
At this sight a gasp went up among Americans attending the early-morning show 
in the theater of Armani's downtown palazzo. Europeans, accustomed to topless 
bathing, didn't bat an eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
Still known to some as the blazer king, Armani showed long jackets for spring, 
this time with curved fronts that recall the tulip petal shape seen several 
seasons ago in the collection of Italy's Romeo Gigli. 
</P>
<P>
There was a touch of Gigli, too, in the rounded, uneven hemlines of skirts and 
dresses. For summer, Armani's hemlines are hiked way above his demure winter 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Lightweight pantsuits with ample jackets and baggy trousers, and a series of 
cool cotton jumpsuits were Armani's answer to city-dweller fashions for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Franco Moschino, a favorite among the young-at-heart, showed his collection 
just after Armani. He is known by now for his sense of irony toward the fashion 
world at large. This time as usual, he tended to hide his own beautiful clothes 
under exaggerations of other designers' embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
In past collections, Moschino's antics have included an entire show based on 
outrageous headgear -- from stovepipes to teddy bear shapes -- as a sendup of 
French designer Christian Lacroix's extravagant hats. Almost always, he ladens 
his evening wear with heavy gold chains, to imitate the popular, Parisian 
Chanel look. 
</P>
<P>
This time, like Armani, Moschino flirted with the hippie idea, in a series of 
multicolored gypsy skirts, jeans outfits and Mexican-style long vests. But his 
most astonishing outfit was a three-piece suit -- jacket, brassiere and short 
skirt -- in glimmering gold fabric, with lavish gold jewelry and a gold chain 
belt. (There are bra tops galore in the new spring collections here.) And his 
most ironic style in the spring show was a floor-length black chiffon gown with 
the gold letters, VIP, extending from the neckline down the bodice. 
</P>
<P>
In his Sunday night show, Gianni Versace combined a multitude of shades into 
beautiful silk prints for skirts, pants, jackets and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The daring shapes of his clothes -- his skirts are known to be so short and 
tight they barely cover the hips -- and his penchant for theatrical styles make 
him a favorite in Hollywood and among rock stars. There is enough gold and 
glitz in his new collection to satisfy even the most demanding entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
Outfits were adorned with gold balls, tassels and colorful crystals. And he 
decorated shoes with gold studs. 
</P>
<P>
It is a strong statement, but Versace's exquisite tailoring and artistic sense 
make it work. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant in his spring collection are high-waisted silk pants with one leg slit 
open to the hip, mini lingerie dresses in bright shades of taffeta, bra tops 
and bustiers encrusted with colorful crystals, silk printed lapels on 
man-tailored jackets, fringed piano shawls to drape over the shoulders or tie 
around the hips. 
</P>
<P>
At Missoni, famous for artistic sweaters, the new stitch is a zig-zag crochet. 
The new jacket is hip length and reversible, with one side in quilted fabric 
and the other a bulky striped knit. 
</P>
<P>
At Byblos -- who showed Monday, as did Missoni -- the unusual summer palette is 
based in rich browns, which appeared in floral prints and solids mixed with 
white, sienna, amethyst, ruby and violet. A naval theme ran through the 
collection, with gaily colored nautical flags, gold braiding, exaggerated 
emblems, and bold red and blue stripes.

JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S.-BASHING BOOK BY SONY'S CHIEF COSTS HIM CREDIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Akio Morita, the renowned founder and chairman of Sony Corp., has made an error 
in judgment. He has co-authored a book, with an anti-American Japanese 
politician, titled "The Japan That Can Say 'No' ." The book advises Japan to 
say no to U.S. demands on trade and investment and also on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for Japan to tell the U.S. that we do not need American 
protection. Japan will protect itself with its own power and wisdom," writes 
the politician, Shintaro Ishihara, a ranking member of Japan's ruling party who 
finished third in the recent balloting for prime minister. "Technology can be 
the basis for Japan's defense," continues Ishihara, crediting the thought to 
Minoru Genda, one of the commanders of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"If, for example, Japan sold (semiconductor) chips to the Soviet Union and 
stopped selling them to the U.S.," writes Ishihara, "this would upset the 
entire military balance." 
</P>
<P>
That's not true, of course, but it's characteristic of this strange book. 
Ishihara frequently gets carried away with dislike for America -- "such a 
shifty country" -- and Americans, whom he accuses of racial prejudice in 
dropping the atomic bomb on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ishihara is not the problem. Every country has jingoistic politicians, 
and Ishihara's writings would not have received notice outside Japan -- 
especially as the book has not been formally translated -- if Morita had not 
been involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that Japan's best known businessman contributed every other 
chapter has given the book wide notice. A partial translation has been 
distributed to members of Congress; copies circulate in U.S. business circles 
and in the Hollywood entertainment community, where Sony has become a prominent 
force through its purchase of CBS Records and pending acquisition of Columbia 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goes Off Deep End 
</P>
<P>
The question is what does Morita have to do with Ishihara? When asked, Sony's 
American subsidiary gives out its chairman's answers at an Oct. 2 press 
conference in Tokyo. "I now regret my association with this project," said 
Morita, "because it has caused so much confusion. I don't feel U.S. readers 
understand that my opinions are separate from Ishihara's. My 'essays' express 
my opinions and his 'essays' express his opinions." 
</P>
<P>
Morita's own chapters mostly criticize American industry for laxity in 
manufacturing and shortsightedness in investment -- themes he has sounded in 
the past. However, in this book, Morita goes further, telling his Japanese 
readers, "America has a great many defects of its own, to which we must 
continuously direct its attention." 
</P>
<P>
Morita cites the often misguided layoff policies of U.S. corporations, but then 
goes off the deep end in his comparison. "America has been condemning nations 
such as South Africa and Afghanistan on human rights issues," Morita writes, 
"however, I must ask Americans if they are applying these same standards to 
their own workers." 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Mr. Morita? (Sony says its products are distributed in South 
Africa, although it doesn't sell directly to that country) Afghanistan, Mr. 
Morita? The truth, it seems clear, is that the Sony chairman let crankiness 
displace judgment -- and his company failed to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
If a major U.S. executive, such as John F. Akers of IBM or Roger B. Smith of 
General Motors, were to co-author a book with a jingoistic extremist like 
Ishihara, it's a good bet their companies would soon be announcing their early 
retirement and denying any connection with the book. But Morita and his family 
own 8% of Sony -- a stake worth $1.6 billion -- so he continues as its 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The poignant irony is that Morita has been regarded as the most international 
of Japanese businessmen, the man who moved his family to the United States in 
1962, the better to study the American market. Morita and Sony have done well 
in America and there is little doubt he has high regard for its principles, 
although his recent criticisms have grown harsher as suspicion has seemed to 
grow between the two peoples. 
</P>
<P>
In Japanese business circles these days, there are frequent complaints that 
America singles out Japanese investment for criticism that it does not direct 
at other foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
America, meanwhile, looks at its own deficits and the vastness of Japan's 
surplus capital -- $71 billion at last count -- and fears the consequences of 
its own overconsumption of imported goods and lack of savings. In that light, 
Morita and Ishihara's book could do some good -- as a warning that America 
invites only disdain unless it gets its economic house in order. 
</P>
<P>
But the book is likely to do more harm than good, giving support to Japan's 
critics in Congress and leading to counterproductive policies. Which is 
unfortunate because America and Japan, with a lot more to cooperate on than to 
quarrel about, need to build trust and reduce suspicion. Sadly, Akio Morita, 
who was always seen as part of the solution in that regard, now appears to be 
part of the problem.

QINTEX'S PLAN TO ACQUIRE MGM/UA FALLS APART; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE AUSTRALIAN FIRM IS SUED FOR FRAUD AFTER FAILING TO FULFILL 
PROMISES. SPURNED SUITOR RUPERT MURDOCH MAY MAKE ANOTHER OFFER.

<P>
True to Hollywood's and Wall Street's most cynical expectations, MGM/UA 
Communications Co.'s "irrevocable" sale to the Australian Qintex Group 
collapsed Tuesday amid rancorous accusations and a lawsuit by MGM/UA accusing 
the Australian firm of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5-billion deal -- amended twice over the course of seven months -- came 
unglued after Qintex failed to deliver a $50-million letter of credit by Sept. 
22 as promised. 
</P>
<P>
The deal's collapse was a blow to MGM/UA employees as well as to majority owner 
Kirk Kerkorian, who -- after 20 years of selling and repurchasing various MGM 
assets -- appeared genuinely committed to the sale of the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
On another level, the scrapped transaction appears mortifying and costly 
because two bids by media mogul Rupert Murdoch were spurned in favor of Qintex. 
In the last go-round, members of the Murdoch camp accused Kerkorian of using 
their offer to extract a higher price from Qintex. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch could not be reached for comment late Tuesday, but earlier in the day, 
he addressed a News Corp. shareholders meeting in Australia and said he might 
still be interested in MGM/UA, although he wasn't prepared to raise his bid. 
</P>
<P>
No overtures had been made as of Tuesday night, however. "We are not in contact 
with MGM, and they are not in contact with us," said Barry Diller, chairman of 
Fox Inc., another Murdoch-controlled entertainment conglomerate that 
participated in the earlier MGM/UA bids. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at rival Hollywood studios predicted privately that Murdoch will 
step up again -- but perhaps at a lower price. "I think Rupert wanted it 
badly," said one entertainment executive. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's entrepreneurial chairman, Christopher C. Skase, was unavailable for 
comment, but the company issued a copy of an Oct. 11 letter to the Brisbane 
Stock Exchange that expressed Qintex's version of recent developments. 
</P>
<P>
Skase said Qintex had posted security for the $50-million letter of credit but 
received "subsequent demands" from MGM/UA, including additional letters of 
credit and "substantial liquidated damage" which, in Qintex's view, were 
proposed in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's demands "shifted daily and, in essence, reflected an attempt by MGM to 
extract higher economic value," resulting in Qintex's ultimate determination 
that acceding to the financial requests would not be in the best interest of 
Qintex's shareholders, Skase wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Skase's version was denounced by MGM/UA's lead attorney as "a bald-faced lie." 
Terry Christensen, the attorney who has worked closely with Kerkorian for two 
decades, declared in a telephone interview that "the letter is patently absurd 
and ignores the fact that they were in default when they woke up on the morning 
of Sept. 23." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to assess Kerkorian's personal reaction, Christensen said "he feels 
badly" that Skase couldn't complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
At MGM/UA's headquarters in Beverly Hills, company Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow 
read a brief statement from Kerkorian. "We were extremely disappointed. We 
tried to hold the transaction together in every possible way that we could 
think of. Finally it became clear to the board that Qintex could not perform." 
</P>
<P>
Barbakow ticked off several of the solutions proposed by MGM/UA, to no avail. 
The company offered to reduce the letter of credit or to accept substitute 
security, or even a favorable opinion from an investment banker on Qintex's 
behalf, he said. MGM/UA also proposed that Qintex could proceed without a 
letter of credit if it agreed to allow MGM/UA to consider a better offer. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian's own company, Tracinda Corp., indicated a willingness to help 
finance up to $135 million of the acquisition cost, without requiring voting 
rights in the surviving corporation, Barbakow said. 
</P>
<P>
But Qintex's final proposal, according to Barbakow, was "to eliminate the 
letter of credit or any other security" and to postpone for two months the 
closing date of the deal. MGM/UA would also have been required to invest in 
Qintex "without any confirmation from Qintex of its ability to perform." The 
upshot was "we had no choice other than to terminate the agreement," Barbakow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Files Suit 
</P>
<P>
Evidence surfaced last week that Qintex was having difficulty delivering the 
non-refundable payment, but the company told the Brisbane Stock Exchange that 
it had posted security with a bank to obtain the letter of credit, and Qintex 
executives publicly expressed confidence that the deal was on track. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for MGM/UA filed a lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles against Qintex Australia Ltd., alleging breach of contract, fraud and 
negligent misrepresentation, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12-page complaint, MGM/UA said Qintex induced MGM/UA to reject Murdoch's 
cash offer last month of $23.16 per share. As a result, MGM/UA said it has 
suffered damages exceeding $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The scrapped deal was announced after the close of trading. On the New York 
Stock Exchange, MGM/UA lost 62.5 cents a share to close at $21, on volume of 
79,800 shares. In the over-the-counter market, Qintex closed at $5.625 a share, 
off 25 cents, on volume of 45,800 shares.

3 TRUMP CASINO EXECUTIVES KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three casino executives who worked for billionaire real estate developer Donald 
J. Trump were among five people killed Tuesday afternoon in a helicopter crash 
in New Jersey about 40 miles north of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
The three officials, including Trump's top two gaming industry executives in 
Atlantic City, were returning from New York, where they had been promoting an 
upcoming boxing match between junior welterweights Hector Camacho and Vinny 
Pazienza. 
</P>
<P>
The three casino executives killed were Stephen Hyde, Mark Grossinger Etess and 
Jonathan Benanav. The two remaining victims, who were not immediately 
identified, were believed to be the pilot and co-pilot of the helicopter, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde ran Trump's two operating casinos in Atlantic City, known as Trump Plaza 
and Trump Castle, while Etess was going to run the Taj Mahal, the $1-billion 
casino and hotel that Trump plans to open in Atlantic City next April. Benanav 
was senior vice president of Trump Plaza, where the Camacho-Pazienza fight is 
to be held Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"They were three fabulous young men in the prime of their lives," Trump said in 
a statement issued from his New York office. "No better human beings ever 
existed. We're deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy. Our hearts go out 
to their families." 
</P>
<P>
The leased helicopter crashed in a heavily wooded area on the median strip of 
the Garden State Parkway that runs down the New Jersey coastline. There were no 
survivors, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Murray, of East Providence, R.I., said he was camping nearby when he 
witnessed the helicopter crash to the ground. The "rotor stopped spinning and 
became disconnected from the helicopter and tumbled," Murray told the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devoted Family Men 
</P>
<P>
Both Hyde, 43, and Etess, 38, were respected executives who were popular with 
their peers. "Nice is not a word that is often used in this business, but they 
were," said David Gardener, vice president of the Casino Assn. of Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde, a devout Mormon with a large family, was a veteran casino executive who 
had worked for gaming companies in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City, including 
Caesars World, Golden Nugget and the Sands. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a certified public accountant, he joined Caesars World after working 
for the company as their outside auditor, according to Michael Rumbolz, who 
works for Trump in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Etess was a fourth-generation hotelier whose family founded the famous 
Grossinger's resort in the Catskills, in the heart of the so-called Borscht 
Belt, that was so popular with generations of New York tourists. 
</P>
<P>
He left the family business in 1983 for Atlantic City, where he went to work as 
the marketing director for the Golden Nugget casino. He joined the Trump 
Organization in 1986 and had since played a major role in bringing big-name 
fights to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
A slick dresser and easy talker, Etess was a combination of canny promoter and 
devoted father who talked about his two children more fervently than he did his 
job to run the Taj. "That's what it's all about," he said in a recent interview 
with The Times, pointing to a picture of his children in his cramped office 
across the street from the Taj. 
</P>
<P>
Though Trump owns a helicopter service that flies between Manhattan and 
Atlantic City, the craft that crashed was identified as an eight-seat Agusta 
109A leased from Paramount Aviation in New Jersey.

IN TOPSY-TURVY MARKET, GAS PRICES ARE UP SLIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're up, they're down, they're up. 
</P>
<P>
Prices at fuel pumps nationwide edged up slightly in the past month, the latest 
turn in an upside-down gasoline market that has defied conventional wisdom this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The weighted average price of all grades of gasoline nationwide rose slightly, 
to 109.56 cents a gallon as of Oct. 6 from 109.43 cents a gallon Sept. 22, 
according to the latest Lundberg Survey of 12,000 service stations. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive price increase reported at a time of year when 
prices usually drop as demand slacks off, but it was only the latest surprise 
in a year that has seen prices defy prediction. 
</P>
<P>
Retail prices fell all summer, usually a period of high demand and rising 
prices, from a peak of 118.43 cents a gallon on May 19 to a low of 109.07 cents 
a gallon on Sept. 8, the Lundberg Survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, gasoline prices spiked sharply in the spring, usually a time of 
slack demand, partly to catch up with higher crude oil prices and refining 
costs, and partly in reaction to the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an extraordinary year," said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg's national averages don't reflect regional variations. In Los Angeles, 
gasoline prices continued to fall through September. The average price of 
self-service regular unleaded, the most popular grade, was 92.76 cents a gallon 
on Oct. 6. Los Angeles prices peaked at 114.24 cents a gallon on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the recent nationwide increases are slight and may be a sign that 
gas prices are flattening out, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, the outlook is for prices to be moderately unchanged," said 
Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in 
New York. "We might see movement of 2 cents either way, but not more than that, 
and it's likely to remain stable at least through Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painful Price Cuts 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency is for prices to decline (from the end) of November through March 
. . . and I don't see any reason why that seasonal tendency shouldn't occur 
this year," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg said: "For prices to strengthen slightly on average, when throughout 
the year they were both rising and falling with great rapidity, seems 
unsurprising. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the wholesalers and retailers (who got) caught up in the price-cutting 
clearly hit their bottom lines beyond fat and cut into bone, and many of those 
then had to raise prices," she added. 
</P>
<P>
One important factor has been the cost of crude oil. After rising earlier in 
the year, crude prices now hover around $20 a barrel for the U.S. benchmark 
crude West Texas Intermediate, and economists don't expect a major change for 
the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, refiners' profit margins recently have narrowed somewhat, said 
Thomas Burns, manager of economics at Chevron Corp. in San Francisco. "So 
there's some impetus to see slightly higher gasoline prices, but not a lot, 
especially as we move out of the peak season," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Prices spurted in April and May, partly in anticipation of shortages due to the 
tanker accident in Alaska. Without the spill, prices may have risen anyway, but 
at a much slower rate more in keeping with the season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some observers had predicted gasoline shortages for the summer, 
partly as a result of increased demand for higher grades of gasoline and partly 
because of more stringent federal vapor regulations that threatened to restrict 
supply. Those conditions led refiners to step up operations to meet expected 
demand, and many refineries ran at well over 90% throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But the unexpectedly high prices may have hurt demand. "The much-vaunted summer 
driving season that was expected to be tight not only in the U.S., but also 
worldwide, never came to pass," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Some drivers may have shifted from higher grades of gasoline, and imported 
fuels were readily available to meet any shortfall. The net result: "An 
oversupply of gasoline" that led to declining prices, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP Gasoline prices should hold firm at least through November, barring 
unforeseen disruptions in supply, economists said. Beyond that, prices normally 
fall through March.

NEW SOFTWARE BY DIGITAL TO LINK OFFICE PCS 
</P>

<P>
Digital Equipment Corp., which has seen its sales slump, introduced a system of 
office software Tuesday designed to let computers made by different companies 
share information and work together. 
</P>
<P>
The action marks the latest move toward equipment that is compatible throughout 
the computer industry, easing some of the confusion for customers who have had 
to struggle with diverse systems, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"With any large company, the most important and hardest business problem is 
that they have all these different types of desktop computers, and they want 
all these people to work together," said Henry Ancona, company vice president 
for business and office information systems. 
</P>
<P>
The new system will be compatible not only with Digital's VAX computers but 
also with popular systems from International Business Machines Corp., Apple 
Computer Inc. and Microsoft Corp., the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers using this system "can share computing software, and transmit data, 
documents and pictures," Kenneth Olsen, president of the Maynard, Mass.-based 
company, said in a prepared statement. "It's just common sense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Links Computers 
</P>
<P>
The software, which was presented Tuesday at an office computer convention in 
New York, will be available next year. 
</P>
<P>
Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behind IBM, was long known 
for the compatibility within its VAX system, pushing the slogan "Digital has it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IBM this year introduced software that can run across the full range 
of its machines. 
</P>
<P>
But company officials and analysts say Digital's move takes compatibility 
further by linking computers from different companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that reflects the reality of the market," Ancona said. "It would be 
arrogant to tell a customer that if you buy our computer, you have to throw out 
everything else you've invested in." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Shannon, an analyst with International Data Corp., a computer market 
researcher based in Framingham, Mass., said, "I think DEC's made a very 
significant step forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Digital is saying if you don't have a Digital PC (personal computer), it's 
fine," Shannon said. "Their concern is the underlying system." 
</P>
<P>
Computer software, which runs the programs, is representing a more lucrative 
market in comparison with the machines themselves, which are becoming less 
expensive, Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Digital can employ the integrated system to introduce its products to 
customers using other computers and possibly persuade them to use more Digital 
computers, said Sonny Monosson, publisher of the Monosson Report in Boston, 
which monitors activities at Digital. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new system comes as the company tries to reverse a 
sales slump. 
</P>
<P>
Digital's earnings slid 22% for the year that ended July 1, and the company has 
frozen salaries and transferred hundreds of employees from manufacturing to 
sales jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, John J. Shields, who was in charge of sales and was long regarded as 
the No. 2 man at Digital, resigned from the company.

COMPUTER FIRMS SAY VIRUS THREAT IS SERIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
Major computer companies say they are taking seriously the threat of a computer 
virus attack later this week and are advising employees to take precautions to 
protect their systems. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and International Business Machines 
Corp. have both issued internal memos warning staff about the impending virus, 
called Datacrime, which is expected to be activated Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A computer virus is a destructive program in a computer system that can damage 
or destroy data. It is called a virus because it acts like a biological virus 
-- it can travel from an "infected" disk or program and infect other computers. 
</P>
<P>
Computer industry experts say Datacrime is an especially dangerous virus that 
could infect older IBM personal computers and compatibles based on Intel 
Corp.'s 8086 chip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Puts Organization at Risk 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very rare but very destructive," said Russell Brand, chief 
technical adviser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, 
Calif. Brand said his group has examined Datacrime in an infected computer. 
</P>
<P>
Since networked computer systems are so widely used by major corporations, 
universities and the government, a virus could disrupt thousands of machines. A 
virus also puts an organization at risk if its computer is penetrated by 
outsiders or exposed to programs of unknown origin. 
</P>
<P>
Brand said Datacrime is unique because it can wipe out a complete hard disk. 
"Most viruses, you can put the data back together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a hard disk drive, there is no way of getting to information on the 
disk, except to re-format that sector -- thus destroying all the files. 
</P>
<P>
At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, employees were warned not to use software from 
unknown sources and to back up data. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, which introduced an anti-viral software product last week, said it is 
advising its employees to begin using its new software, and make copies of 
their data. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's product scans IBM compatible computer programs, looking for a change in 
programming patterns that may signify a computer virus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source Is Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Datacrime, also dubbed the Columbus Day virus because of this week's Columbus 
Day holiday, has already infected a number of corporate systems and government 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
Experts do not know the source of Datacrime, except that it was first discussed 
publicly at a conference for computer hackers in Europe this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Brand and other experts said there are other viruses rumored among computer 
hackers -- one estimate is that about 77 viruses are in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the oldest viruses is called Jerusalem and has about 12 strains, or 
variations. Jerusalem, which was discovered by a professor at Hebrew 
University, may also awaken later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Computer viruses became international news last November when Robert Morris, a 
Cornell University graduate student, wrote and unleashed a program that 
eventually got into one of the largest computer networks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"People are worried about (viruses), especially those that rely on their PCs," 
said Michael Riemer, executive vice president of Foundationware Inc., a 
consulting firm in Cleveland. "But what viruses have done is forced people to 
look at security and system management in place." 
</P>
<P>
Increased concern about viruses has led to more anti-viral software programs on 
the market, some available at no cost through software-sharing programs.

information company, to buy the rest of Telerate for $376.2 million is 
inadequate. Dow Jones has offered $18 a share for Telerate. Telerate said the 
offer is not in its best interests -- or that of its stockholders, other than 
Dow Jones, which owns 63.6 million common shares. The Telerate committee 
recommended that stockholders not tender any shares under the offer, adding 
that it was advised by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. that the offer was 
inadequate from a financial viewpoint.

SMALE TO QUIT TOP P&amp;G POST; ARTZT NEXT CEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John G. Smale announced that he will resign as chairman and chief executive of 
Procter &amp; Gamble as one of several top-level personnel moves at the 
consumer products company. 
</P>
<P>
Smale, 62, said he wanted to spend more time with his family. He has been the 
company's chief executive for nine years and plans to leave Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The new chairman and chief executive will be Edwin L. Artzt, 59, now vice 
chairman and president of Procter &amp; Gamble's international operations. 
</P>
<P>
Company President John E. Pepper will give up most of his responsibility for 
domestic operations to oversee the international business. 
</P>
<P>
Smale announced the changes at a shareholders' annual meeting that was 
punctuated by an "animal rights" demonstration. Several dozen people picketed 
outside the headquarters while others questioned Smale during the meeting about 
Procter &amp; Gamble's use of animals in testing new products. 
</P>
<P>
The company, in recent years a target of animal-protection groups, maintains 
that marketing certain products without first testing them on animals would be 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
Nine shareholders expressed concerns about testing practices, but Smale would 
not say how many animals are being used. He said the company had reduced the 
number of test animals by a third in the past five years and will continue to 
seek alternative methods. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split, effective Oct. 20, that will 
increase the authorized number of common shares to 1 billion from 500 million. 
</P>
<P>
After his leaving his executive position, Smale will remain a Procter &amp; 
Gamble employee as a director and as chairman of the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
"By January, I will have been president and then chairman of Procter &amp; 
Gamble for nearly 16 years," Smale said. "I will have been the chief executive 
officer of the company for nine years. I've reached the conclusion that for me 
as well as for my family, it's time to turn this responsibility over to someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Smale has led the company into new product lines, and two years ago supervised 
an $805-million reorganization aimed at streamlining management. During his 
tenure, the company acquired Richardson-Vicks, some major brands from G. D. 
Searle, and Noxell Corp. Those moves gave the personal-care products giant a 
wide base in over-the-counter drugs and beauty products. 
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble had sales of $21.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 
30, and net earnings of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Smale also helped the company branch out into foreign markets. Roughly 39% of 
its sales in the last fiscal year were based outside the United States, and 
Smale said that proportion should top 50% within a few years.

EL DIARIO PAPER CLOSES AFTER ITS MONEY RUNS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Diario de Los Angeles, one of the city's three Spanish-language daily 
newspapers, stopped publication over the weekend after struggling for 2 
1/2-years to win readers and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jose Mariano Castillo, who represents the paper's Mexican owners, said 
on Monday that efforts to find new investors will continue, but he holds little 
hope for raising the necessary money. 
</P>
<P>
"They hope that it will be restarted again as soon as they can get 
refinancing," Castillo said of the owners. "I don't see that happening right 
now. I don't want anybody to get their hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
Castillo said El Diario published its last edition Saturday and laid off 24 
employees, including the paper's editorial staff. The company will continue to 
operate as a printing press, he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Diario's owners invested about $3 million to start up operations as the 
region's third Spanish-language daily. The paper competed against La Opinion, 
Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language daily, and Noticias del Mundo, owned by a 
company controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. 
</P>
<P>
Plans called for the paper to begin turning a profit within a year. Instead, El 
Diario circulation topped out at 30,000 and never managed to attract 
significant amounts of advertising. The paper filed for bankruptcy earlier this 
year and was losing about $60,000 a month, according to executives. 
</P>
<P>
The paper even appealed to its readers for help, asking them to buy the paper 
at news stands and attend fund raisers. But the efforts apparently fell short. 
</P>
<P>
"They just ran out of money," Castillo said. "There were some very dedicated 
employees there who struggled a lot. I hope it comes back again."

PROFIT TAKING SENDS DOW DOWN 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices fell Tuesday in light trading, weighed down by profit taking and 
comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that appeared to 
reduce chances of an imminent cut in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, falling for the first time this month, 
declined 6.08 points to 2,785.33. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, responding to pressure from the Bush Administration to cut interest 
rates and bring the dollar down, said in a speech in Moscow that such 
short-term policy goals were misguided and that the Fed's central aim was to 
fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
His comments suggest that the Fed is in no hurry to reduce interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates slow the economy, hurting most businesses, and also make 
fixed-income investments such as bonds more attractive in relation to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Led by blue chip issues, Wall Street had advanced to record highs recently. 
Many market strategists have expected the Dow index to show some resistance as 
it approaches the 2,800 mark, which it has never surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had five straight up days," said Tom Callahan, a Yamaichi International 
executive vice president. "We should have a little bit of a correction." 
</P>
<P>
Profit takers came in almost immediately after the opening, and mild 
computer-driven program selling in late afternoon helped deepen the decline. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide 
trading of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 831 down, 652 up 
and 493 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 147.56 million shares, up from 
130.72 million in Monday's session, which had been the lowest level in more 
than two months. Monday marked the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Airlines' parent AMR tumbled 
3 3/8 to 101 3/8, apparently reflecting investor skepticism about a 
$120-a-share offer made last week by New York developer Donald J. Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 
176.78 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell sharply on London's stock exchange as an early rally effort 
faltered on worries about the British economy. The Financial Times 100-share 
index, London's most closely watched market barometer, fell 28.2 points to 
close at 2,218.8. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese financial markets were closed Tuesday for Sports Day, a national 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, bond prices fell as traders cashed in some gains made in 
last week's strong rally. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was light as the U.S. credit markets reopened after Monday's Columbus 
Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or $1.56 
for every $1,000 in face amount, from late Friday. Its yield was unchanged at 
8.01% from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market for Treasury bills, notes and bonds was closed Monday, as were 
many banks. In Europe, prices of Treasury issues were slightly higher on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials inched higher. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.34 to 333.92, 
from Monday. The corporate bond market was open for trading on Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.875%, up from 8.813% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The Greenspan comments in Moscow pushed the dollar sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices slipped here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $361 an ounce, down $2.10 from Monday. Republic National Bank of New York 
quoted a late bid for gold also at $361, off $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rally mainly to Greenspan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said "attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to 
destabilizing international capital flows, and ultimately have to be 
abandoned." He said paying inordinate attention to intermediate targets in 
setting monetary policy "may not promote the attainment of long-term goals." 
</P>
<P>
The British pound, meanwhile, continued its sharp drop Tuesday despite last 
week's hike in Britain's interest rates. One dealer said there is a lack of 
confidence in sterling. 
</P>
<P>
In London, it cost $1.5580 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5775 late Monday. 
Sterling fetched $1.5520 in New York, down from $1.5775 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday. But in London, the 
dollar was quoted at 143.25 Japanese yen, down 1.02 yen from Monday. The dollar 
stood at 144.50 yen in New York, up from 142.85 yen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices staged a dramatic turnaround, rising to new contract 
highs early in the session before plunging on reports that a 3-month-old strike 
at a Canadian copper mine was nearly settled. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very violent day," said James Steel, a metals analyst with the 
futures brokerage Refco Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, soybeans sank to 23-month lows while grain futures 
were mixed; energy futures rose strongly; precious metals retreated, and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 2.6 to 3.6 cents lower, with the contract for delivery 
in December at $1.2805 a pound, 5.65 cents off its high for the day of $1.337. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened with strong gains, continuing the upward course that copper 
prices had taken since midyear, when strikes and other production problems at 
major mines around the world began threatening supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But in the afternoon, reports surfaced of significant progress in a strike at 
Highland Valley Copper's mine near Logan Lake, B. C., where workers walked off 
the job July 6 in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures sank to 23-month lows on the Chicago Board of Trade as a 
harvest-related sell-off stretched into its fourth straight day. 
</P>
<P>
The corn and soybean harvest is advancing rapidly under near-perfect conditions 
and analysts said the higher-than-expected yields are exaggerating the normal 
seasonal drop in prices. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 4.50 to 6.75 cents lower, with the contract for 
delivery in November at $5.525 a bushel, the lowest settlement for a near-month 
soybean contract since Nov. 11, 1987.

PILOTS BACK MONEY FOR EASTERN STRIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Air Line Pilots Assn. voted to continue a special dues 
assessment that gives financial support to workers in the eight-month Eastern 
Airlines strike, the pilots union announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A vote against the special assessment would have effectively forced the union 
to pull down its picket lines in surrender to Eastern and its chairman, Frank 
Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots at other airlines are being assessed 3% of their gross pay to a special 
fund that has allowed Eastern pilots to collect an average of $2,400-a-month in 
strike benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the vote, ALPA said "the reaffirmation means the continuation of 
extraordinary strike benefits for Eastern pilots and the special membership 
assessments to fund the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
The balloting of the 40,000 ALPA members was conducted last month by mail amid 
reports that contributions to the fund were declining.

K MART UNVEILS PLANS TO ADD 700 STORES IN $1.3-BILLION EXPANSION 
</P>

TROY, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini on Tuesday outlined a major 
$1.3-billion expansion plan designed to double sales and profits at the 
second-largest U.S. retailer and burnish its image. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini told a news conference that the expansion would be the biggest for the 
Troy, Mich.-based company since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
K mart, No. 2 behind Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. of Chicago, plans to add about 
700 stores through 1995 to its current roster of 2,275 K mart discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer also operates 1,815 specialty stores selling books, drugs, 
hardware and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants to Overtake Sears 
</P>
<P>
K mart, outlining its five-year strategy, told analysts last week that it was 
confident about its prospects for growth. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been seeking to improve profits and overtake Sears as the 
nation's largest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
But profit in the first half of 1989 fell nearly 16% to $239.1 million as 
revenue grew about 4% to $13.07 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini said in a speech Friday that the retailer's expansion plans are 
designed to yield sales of more than $50 billion by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said K mart is targeting annual net income of $1.75 billion by the 
mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, K mart reported earnings of $803 million on sales of $27.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the expansion program, Antonini said Tuesday that K mart will open 85 
to 100 new stores and an additional 100 stores will be expanded each year 
through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
He had indicated to analysts that an average of 20 to 30 of the stores will be 
replacements for small K mart outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini said capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion will be allocated for 
the expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
K mart also expects a positive fourth quarter, which includes the all-important 
Christmas shopping season, when many retailers post most of their profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect a very troublesome fourth quarter," he said. Antonini said his 
optimism is because the fall season is "shaping up better than anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Antonini said the company bases its projection in part on the fact that 
inflation remains under control and interest rates appear not to be too high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Media Mix 
</P>
<P>
The company last week said it expected to report a decline in third-quarter 
earnings from the year-earlier's $126.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to analysts, Antonini said K mart's strategy also includes: 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of dominant life style departments. 
</P>
<P>
* More centralized merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased emphasis on everyday low prices. 
</P>
<P>
* Major capital investment in automation. 
</P>
<P>
* Growth and experimentation in non-discount store businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Antonini also said the company is putting more emphasis on television 
advertising, cutting back slightly on print advertising. 
</P>
<P>
K mart stock closed down 25 cents a share at $38.50 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading.

STATE'S OIL, GAS PRODUCTION PLUNGE; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: AMPLE SUPPLIES OF OPEC CRUDE, WHICH IS CLEANER AND CHEAPER TO REFINE, 
HAVE PUSHED CALIFORNIA'S OUTPUT TO 1981 LEVELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A market flooded with OPEC crude oil has resulted in a dramatic drop in 
California oil and gas production, according to the state's Division of Oil and 
Gas. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released Tuesday, the state said 1988 crude oil production slipped 
to the 1981 level of 387 million barrels, compared to 397 million barrels in 
1987 and 407 million barrels in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is certain how long this pricing instability will continue, but it is 
not conducive to investment in the (California) oil industry," said William 
Guerard, technical services manager for the Department of Conservation's 
Division of Oil and Gas. 
</P>
<P>
California crude oil, which is dirtier and requires more costly refining than 
OPEC crude, is currently selling for about $13 a barrel, down from a peak price 
of $25 in 1981. In contrast, the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Light closed 
Tuesday at $15.80 a barrel. (A barrel contains 42 gallons.) 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the oil and gas produced in California is sold and consumed 
here, according to Guerard. He said the substantial decrease in statewide oil 
production is worrisome because California already imports about 40% of the oil 
products it needs. Any disruption in the flow of oil from members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or Alaska could have a serious 
impact on Californians, who last year consumed 565.8 million barrels of refined 
oil products, according to the California Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The depressed domestic oil prices also put a damper on the drilling of new oil 
wells. According to the state's oil and gas report, the number of new oil, gas, 
service and exploratory wells drilled decreased to 2,539 in 1988. from 2,638 in 
1987. The number of new production wells completed dropped to 1,739 in 1988 
from 2,110 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shell Oil Tops List 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some Saudi Arabia wells, which produce 22,000 barrels of oil a day, 
California's oil wells produce an average of 22 barrels a day, according to 
Guerard. 
</P>
<P>
California's natural gas production dropped to 403.2 billion cubic feet in 1988 
from 427.4 billion cubic feet in 1987. The decrease was primarily due to a 
decline in the production of gas from gas fields rather than the gas that is 
produced along with crude oil, the report said. Although dozens of big and 
small oil companies have drilling operations throughout California, Shell Oil 
topped the list in terms of total production in 1988. Shell produced 84.8 
million barrels, followed by Texaco with 49.6 million barrels and Chevron with 
47.5 million, according to the division. 
</P>
<P>
"About 75 to 80% of Shell's oil is produced in Kern County through enhanced 
recovery methods," said Bill Gibson, spokesman for Shell Western Exploration 
and Production Inc. in Bakersfield. In the most common form of enhanced 
recovery, steam is injected into the wells to heat up the oil and increase its 
flow.

INVESTMENT FUND SELLS AMR SHARES TO CASH IN ON BID 
</P>

A major institutional investor in AMR Corp. said Tuesday that it has sold all 
its shares to take advantage of inflated stock prices in the wake of Donald J. 
Trump's $7-billion buyout proposal for the company that owns American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday, when Trump's $120-per-share offer was made public, Windsor 
Fund has sold its 425,000 shares, said John B. Neff, who has managed the fund 
for 25 years. "We're out as of yesterday," Neff said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, little additional information emerged on Trump's bid, revealed last 
Thursday in a letter to the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Falls 
</P>
<P>
Trump said in New York that he was serious about acquiring the airline, 
although he would not reveal any details of his financing. Trump also said he 
would leave the airline's headquarters in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
AMR's stock fell in trading in the New York Stock Exchange, closing down $3.25 
a share at $101.50, reflecting speculation that Trump's offer is a ploy to 
increase the value of his AMR stock and not a serious offer for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a hard time taking Mr. Trump seriously. One hundred twenty dollars is a 
very full price, and I don't know where the financing is going to come from," 
Neff said. "This isn't loose change." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, the Windsor Fund held 4 million shares of AMR stock, and airline 
said in its annual report that institutional investors hold about 80% of its 
58.9 million outstanding shares.

MCI SUES AT&amp;T, CLAIMS ITS ADS ARE MISLEADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
MCI Communications Corp. filed suit Tuesday against American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co., claiming that AT&amp;T was trying to protect its eroding share 
of the long-distance market through maliciously false and deceptive 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said later it will file a countersuit. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court suit charges that beginning in January, AT&amp;T 
launched a counterattack against its competitors to regain market share, and in 
July began targeting MCI's new Prime Time, cut-rate long-distance calling plan. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said AT&amp;T advertising "maliciously attacked MCI's honesty and the 
value of MCI's competing services by falsely and deceptively representing that 
AT&amp;T was superior to its competitors in general, and MCI in particular, in 
terms of trustworthiness, quality and price." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspent Heavily on Ads 
</P>
<P>
MCI Chairman William G. McGowan said AT&amp;T is losing 100,000 customers a 
week, and "they are panicking about it." 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that AT&amp;T is using "blatantly false and 
defamatory" ads to "staunch the flood of customers who are switching to MCI and 
other companies." 
</P>
<P>
MCI itself is known for aggressive advertising, such as showing people fainting 
when they see their non-MCI long-distance phone bills. But McGowan said MCI now 
is being outspent 8 to 1 by AT&amp;T in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
McGowan labeled various AT&amp;T ads as "sleazy" and "ridiculous." He said he 
could not estimate the losses MCI had suffered as a result of AT&amp;T ads, but 
he said "it's substantial." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said: "We welcome the opportunity to discuss who 
is misleading whom and will do so in a countersuit. We have been concerned 
about MCI's sometimes misleading print and broadcast advertising and have 
complained about it directly to MCI." 
</P>
<P>
He cited MCI commercials "that compare MCI Prime Time prices with our basic 
long-distance prices instead of our Reach Out America prices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ongoing Battle 
</P>
<P>
"AT&amp;T stands behind its advertising," Linnen added. 
</P>
<P>
As for claims that AT&amp;T is losing customers, Linnen said "If anyone . . . 
chooses a brief moment in time on which to base figures they are going to 
mislead, and we are not going to play that game." 
</P>
<P>
Linnen said AT&amp;T's lawyers had written the four commercial television 
networks earlier this month to complain that an MCI ad promising that its ad 
promising that MCI "always saves you money over AT&amp;T" was false in that 
MCI, in certain calling patterns, was sometimes more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The MCI suit said some AT&amp;T ads featured "alleged research" by AT&amp;T 
Bell Laboratories on the effectiveness of MCI's services. 
</P>
<P>
"AT&amp;T knowingly gambled Bell Laboratories' reputation for scientific 
integrity in a desperate attempt to obtain credibility for AT&amp;T's crass 
commercial defamation of MCI." 
</P>
<P>
The suit is the latest chapter in MCI's long battle with AT&amp;T, which began 
in the 1970s when MCI successfully broke AT&amp;T's long-distance monopoly. The 
two companies have contested each other in the courts and at the Federal 
Communications Commission, which authorizes rates, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T says it has about 70% of the long-distance market, measured by 
interstate and intrastate revenues, or 66%, according to Federal Communications 
Commission estimates of the proportion of minutes in all interstate calls 
handled by AT&amp;T. MCI is No. 2 with more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
MCI's suit suit cites AT&amp;T ads that assert that MCI's rate are cheaper than 
AT&amp;T's only when calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 p.m., or 
that MCI customers "might have had better luck calling Mars" than trying to 
reach MCI representatives for an explanation of their bills. 
</P>
<P>
The ads, the suit claims, also claim non-AT&amp;T companies provide slow 
telephone connections, that other companies don't operate worldwide like 
AT&amp;T and that competing 800, facsimile and WATS services are inferior. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says AT&amp;T "has wrongfully profited and MCI has been damaged by 
being wrongfully thwarted from maximizing its sales potential." 
</P>
<P>
It asks the court to enjoin AT&amp;T "from making false or deceptive 
representations that any AT&amp;T service is materially superior to any 
competing MCI service in terms of quality or lower cost, or that MCI has 
misrepresented its services or rates to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
It also asks that AT&amp;T, for a period of 12 months, stop advertising and 
promoting its products unless "such information clearly and conspicuously 
discloses a court-approved corrective notice that mitigates the lingering 
effects of the misrepresentations described therein." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, it asks for profits "wrongfully amassed by AT&amp;T on the sale 
of its products or services during the period in question," plus interest and 
legal fees.

A LONG WAIT ENDS FOR COUNTRY ENTERTAINER GEORGE STRAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For George Strait, the fifth time is apparently the charm. 
</P>
<P>
After failing to cash in on four previous Country Music Assn. 
entertainer-of-the-year nominations, the shy, soft-spoken Texas singer was 
awarded the organization's highest honor Monday night during a nationally 
televised ceremony originating from the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited," said Strait, who has had 19 No. 1 country hits since making 
his MCA Records debut in 1981. "I've wanted this for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Strait, 37, doesn't offer the original phrasing or distinctive character of 
such acclaimed country vocalists as Merle Haggard and George Jones, but there 
is an underlying sense of musical integrity in his mix of the Western swing and 
honky-tonk traditions. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth-generation cattle rancher with a degree in agriculture from Southwest 
Texas State University, Strait wears a trademark white cowboy hat, freshly 
pressed jeans and stiff, starched shirts that underscore his ties to country 
tradition -- as opposed to the music's rock-oriented or pop-oriented wings. His 
best-known hits include "Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind," "All My Ex's 
Live in Texas" and "Baby's Gotten Good at Goodbye." 
</P>
<P>
Other key winners in the association's 23rd annual awards program included 
Ricky Van Shelton and Kathy Mattea, who were named top male and female 
vocalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God he gave me a voice instead of big feet," joked Shelton, whose 
"Living Proof" album has been on the country best-seller list for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked to do this (sing), because I liked the doing of it," said 
Mattea, whose current hit is titled "Burnin' Old Memories." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams Jr., the association's entertainer of the year for the past two 
years, was the night's only double winner. Both awards were tied to the 
"There's a Tear in My Beer" project, which featured a duet with the singer's 
father, the late Hank Williams. Old footage and sound recordings by the senior 
Williams were used in producing the video and record. 
</P>
<P>
The late Keith Whitley, 33, who died of an accidental alcohol overdose in May, 
won single of the year for his hit "I'm No Stranger to the Rain." Accepting the 
award, Whitley's widow, singer Lorrie Morgan, said, "Five months ago on this 
date, I lost the world's greatest husband, and country music, in my eyes, lost 
the world's greatest singer." 
</P>
<P>
The Judds, the team of mother Naomi and daughter Wynonna, won duo of the year, 
marking the fifth straight time the pair has been named either best duo or 
group of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Thompson, whose numerous country hits in the '40s and '50s included "Wild 
Side of Life" and "No Help Wanted," was named to the Country Music Hall of 
Fame, along with music publishers Cliffie Stone from Los Angeles and the late 
Jack Stapp. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band for top album ("Will the 
Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II"), Highway 101 for top group, Clint Black for 
newcomer, and Max D. Barnes and Vern Gosdin for best song ("Chiseled in 
Stone").

ANOTHER PRIZE?: With Nobel prizes in the news, some people were betting that a 
UC Irvine chemist might be the next recipient. Prof. F. Sherwood Rowland 
stunned the world in 1974 when he and colleague Mario Molina announced that 
man-made chemicals were destroying the Earth's ozone layer. . . . Rowland has 
been recommended for the Nobel chemistry prize at least twice and clearly 
deserves it, UCI dean Harold Moore said. "But there's also politics involved" 
in the final selection -- expected Thursday. Lanie Jones and Dana Parsons

COMPTON SCHOOLS LAUNCH EXPERIMENT TO REDUCE DROPOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Targeting children as young as 5, the Compton Unified School District on 
Tuesday joined with the private, nonprofit group California Tomorrow and three 
area colleges in an unusual, five-year experiment aimed at lowering high school 
dropout rates. 
</P>
<P>
Key to the project, which also involves Cal State Dominguez Hills, UC Irvine 
and Compton Community College, is a sustained effort to boost parents' 
involvement in their youngsters' education through workshops, a drop-in center 
and, eventually, a "parent leadership institute." Although educators have 
widely discussed the need for early intervention to stem the dropout rate, few 
projects have involved children so young. 
</P>
<P>
Begun for Ronald E. McNair Elementary School pupils in kindergarten through 
fifth grade who already have been identified as probable dropouts by the time 
they reach high school, the project will be expanded within five years to all 
the district's elementary schools. Eventually, the district and California 
Tomorrow officials hope that the Parent Education and Leadership Program will 
become a model for other school districts. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Rancho Santiago College formed a partnership with the Santa 
Ana Unified School District to combat dropouts through a variety of programs, 
including working with very young children. Henry Kertman, spokesman for the 
college, said he believes it is the only partnership in the county that 
involves elementary schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Rancho Santiago adopted Wilson Elementary School in Santa Ana 
as part of the program. For example, the college conducts a program of career 
days at Wilson, where professionals in various fields came to talk with the 
school's youngest students about professional goals and careers. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential in this unique partnership to truly impact and enhance the 
educational experiences of these young children is almost limitless," said Judy 
Chitlik, an English instructor at the college who chairs the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
In the Compton program, California Tomorrow, a statewide organization that 
conducts research and sponsors programs focusing on multicultural issues, is 
picking up the program costs -- $95,000 in the first year -- through several 
grants from private foundations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on ways to close the gap between the families and the school 
system," said Linda J. Wong, executive director of California Tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the experiment is an eight-week series of Saturday 
workshops, beginning this week, for 25 parents of children deemed "at risk" of 
becoming dropouts. The workshops, to be conducted in English and Spanish, 
include training in such areas as parenting skills, legal issues facing 
low-income families and how to evaluate children's academic performance. Free 
child care will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leadership Development 
</P>
<P>
Project leaders sent notices, made phone calls and even went door-to-door to 
bring parents into the program. A Tuesday night reception to explain the 
program was expected to draw 100 parents. 
</P>
<P>
Project director Rhonda Trotter said a drop-in center for parents will open in 
mid-November on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The center will provide 
referrals to community service agencies for help with such problems as job 
training, health care and housing as well as counseling for troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next March, the project will sponsor a leadership development 
institute for parents to help them learn to become effective school and 
community leaders, Trotter said. 
</P>
<P>
The three colleges involved will help evaluate the program, track the 
youngsters' progress and encourage the students to continue their educations 
after high school graduation, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
James Catterall, an associate professor of education at UCLA and an expert on 
the nation's dropout problem, said the Compton project "sounds more 
comprehensive" than similar approaches tried in other districts. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, while many educators have advocated starting earlier dropout 
intervention programs, few have actually done so. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that it is "hard to connect with many of these parents," Catterall 
cautioned that the program will need strong resources to succeed and must be 
scrupulously evaluated before it can be of use to other districts with similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
With a dropout rate hovering around 30%, Compton is comparable to the state's 
other urban districts with predominantly poor, minority students, according to 
the state Department of Education. Statewide, the dropout average is 22%, while 
the Los Angeles Unified School District has a rate of 39%. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the dropout rate is 16.9%. But recent state figures showed 
that for Latinos the rate is more than twice as high as it is for Anglo 
students -- 33% compared to 13% -- and it has prompted educators here to look 
for programs aimed at that population. The Santa Ana district, where Latinos 
make up more than 70% of the student enrollment, has instituted a variety of 
programs, such as the partnership with Rancho Santiago, that attempt to target 
young Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The Compton district's approximately 29,000 students are almost evenly divided 
between blacks and Latinos (49% and 48%, respectively). The rest are of Samoan 
or other Pacific Islander backgrounds, according to Deputy Supt. Elisa Sanchez. 
The proportion of Latinos in the district is expected to grow dramatically, 
Sanchez said. Furthermore, the district's population has a high rate of 
transiency -- some schools in the district had pupil turnover rates as high as 
80% during a single school year. 
</P>
<P>
Ask McNair counselor Mae Lockheart how she can identify the young children who 
are likely to drop out of high school and she ticks off a list of sure signals: 
poor attendance records, working below grade level, having trouble getting 
along with teachers and other pupils. 
</P>
<P>
As someone who has specialized for several years in working with these 
children, Lockheart is convinced that the new program is on target. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that parent involvement is very important," Lockheart said. "It 
motivates a child like nobody else can." 
</P>
<P>
And for parent Shawn Louis, who has three children at McNair and is a member of 
the district's advisory council, the project offers the best hope of "seeing 
more parents and the Compton community involved. . . . We're hoping to see a 
much brighter picture." 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Maria Newman in Orange County contributed to this story.

</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
School districts throughout the nation have been experimenting with ways to cut 
high school dropout rates, which are particularly high in urban districts. Some 
components of the Compton project, such as early intervention and increased 
parent involvement, have been tried in other districts, but many such programs 
have lacked adequate resources or enough evaluation to enable them to succeed 
or to be widely applied.

Eleven people have died so far this year in officer-involved shootings. The 
Orange County district attorney's office, which routinely investigates all such 
shootings, is still reviewing the four most recent cases. The first seven cases 
-- from Jan. 29 to July 21 -- have been closed, with the district attorney 
finding no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 10 -- Anaheim -- Police fatally shot Gregory A. Rosenberger, 25, a drug 
suspect, during a struggle with officers. 
</P>

hostage. He died four days later. 
</P>
<P>
July 21 -- Huntington Beach -- Police confronted and fatally shot robbery 
suspect Karl Cardella coming out of a Bank of America branch. Cardella's car 
was punctured by at least 75 bullets during the frantic police chase through 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
July 8 -- Orange -- Responding to a disturbance call, police fatally shot Frank 
Nalepa, who threatened the two patrolmen with a butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
May 25 -- Santa Ana -- During a chase, police fatally shot armed robbery

Feb. 2 -- Anaheim -- After a 45-minute car chase, police shot without warning, 
killing Robert Vincent Edson as he reached in his pocket outside a motel, where 
he and his wife and child had been living. Police thought he was reaching for a 
gun, but he was apparently reaching for keys, as no weapon was found. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 29 -- Garden Grove -- Responding to a domestic disturbance call, police 
fired 14 shots at Paul Gonzales, five of which struck and fatally wounded 
Gonzales as he walked into the living room. Police claimed he drew a weapon, 
which turned out to be a toy gun.

TOLL IN POLICE SHOOTINGS HITS RECORD IN '89; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE CAN'T EXPLAIN RASH OF SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE LEFT 11 
PEOPLE DEAD AND 15 WOUNDED EXCEPT TO SAY THAT 'MORE BAD GUYS ARE CARRYING 
GUNS.'

Local peace officers have killed or wounded 26 people in shootings during the 
first 10 months of 1989 -- the worst year for police gunplay in Orange County 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a record," said Loren DuChesne, a chief investigator for the 
Orange County district attorney's office, which looks into virtually all 
shootings involving law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
County statistics show that police shot at least 20 people in 1988, twice the 
number fired on in 1987. In 1984, 11 people were killed or wounded by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of this year, the toll has been 11 killed and 15 
wounded. Police opened fire in two other cases, but no one was injured. Seven 
shootings occurred in Santa Ana, the most in any city. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities and deputy district attorneys who investigate 
police shootings say they cannot explain the rash of incidents, except that 
there appears to be more violence and resistence to police today. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that more bad guys are carrying guns who aren't afraid to use them," 
said Lt. Richard J. Olson, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. "But exactly why they come out shooting, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Statewide 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the number of justifiable homicides by peace officers has increased 
throughout California since 1983, according to the state attorney general's 
office. Statistics show that 78 people were shot to death by police in 1983, 64 
in 1984, 91 in 1985, 85 in 1986, and 92 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, peace officers are not to blame, according to district 
attorney investigators. Prosecutors say they never have found enough evidence 
to file criminal charges against an officer in the cases closed to date. 
</P>
<P>
The number of officers disciplined by their own departments for violating 
firearms policies is unavailable because police agencies do not have to divulge 
disciplinary information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
While rules governing the use of deadly force differ among departments, most 
firearms policies are designed to give officers discretion. But in all cases, 
there must be an immediate danger to the officers, hostages or innocent 
bystanders. Officers can be reprimanded, suspended without pay or fired for 
violating policy. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown, who investigates fatal police shootings, said 
there is no pattern to the incidents, which makes them difficult to explain. 
"It's hard to say why," he said. "Each case is unique and you can't draw 
parallels from them." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, which usually is notified immediately after a 
police shooting, reviews the incident independent of the police investigation 
and determines whether criminal charges should be filed. 
</P>
<P>
This year began with the case of Paul Gonzales of Garden Grove, who was shot to 
death in his living room Jan. 29 when he displayed what turned out to be a toy 
gun. While relatives of Gonzales said he was unarmed and that his hands were 
visible, the district attorney's office concluded that no charges should be 
filed against police. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, police have shot 18 people who had some type of visible weapon, 
either a pistol, knife, metal pipe, automobile or martial arts device. One man 
was shot after stabbing his wife, and police killed another man who was holding 
his wife hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were shot during struggles with authorities, including Gregory A. 
Rosenberger, 25, who was killed Tuesday by an Anaheim officer. Police said 
Rosenberger, a narcotics suspect, had tried to grab an officer's pistol after a 
chase through a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Three other incidents involved unarmed suspects. One reportedly reached for his 
waistband, which was empty, while another put his hands behind his back as he 
faced officers. Another unarmed man, Ernest Nunez, was shot in the back with a 
shotgun Sept. 20 as he fled from Santa Ana officers answering a robbery 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the suspect is armed "is a big factor in looking at these cases," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace Wade, who supervises police shooting investigations. 
"But every case is different. If a guy walks out of a bank with a gun, that is 
a different from an officer who perceives that a guy has a gun. But officers 
can be right in both cases."

STUDENT SUSPECT IS ORDERED DETAINED

<P>
Cordell L. Robb, the Loara High School student accused of shooting a boy in the 
face and holding a drama class hostage, was deemed too dangerous to release 
Tuesday and will remain in Orange County Juvenile Hall during his criminal 
case. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing to determine whether Robb should be turned over to his parents, 
Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson ruled that the 15-year-old represented a 
threat to himself and others and must be detained indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Proctor, a private attorney appointed by the court to represent Robb, 
did not oppose Jameson's decision. Outside the courtroom, Proctor said the 
charges against his client were serious and that Juvenile Hall officials placed 
the youth on a "suicide watch" for a short time after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, reportedly beset with family problems, is accused of attempted murder, 
assault with a deadly weapon, five counts of false imprisonment and bringing a 
firearm onto school grounds. If convicted, he could be imprisoned in the 
California Youth Authority until he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the ninth-grader armed himself with a handgun and shotgun, walked 
into a drama class and shot Anthony Lopez, 15, in the left side of the face, 
authorities said. He held students at gunpoint for about half an hour while 
talking to police on a classroom telephone and then surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's hearing, Robb -- dressed in a blue T-shirt, jeans and blue 
tennis shoes -- sat quietly at the defense table, his hands cuffed behind his 
back. His mother, Katherine McAfee, was in court with her sister, Patricia 
Sjogeren. Both declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
At Proctor's request, Jameson appointed Dr. Ernest Klatte, a psychiatrist, to 
assess Robb's mental stability and determine if the youth is fit to cooperate 
with his attorney. Proctor said Klatte's conclusions will help determine 
whether he will pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity type of defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear, the young man is pretty disturbed," Proctor said. "There 
appears to be a lot of abuse by his stepfather, both mental and physical, that 
had an effect on his psyche." 
</P>
<P>
Robb allegedly took the class hostage in an attempt to get his stepfather's 
attention so they could discuss their problems, Proctor contended. He said that 
the family is moving to Northern California and that the boy no longer wanted 
to live with his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of adolescents with these kinds of difficulties -- the 
need to talk to someone," Proctor said. "I hope this message will go out to 
parents before this happens again." 
</P>
<P>
Proctor raised similar theories during his representation of Joeri DeBeer, a 
Dutch youth convicted in 1986 of murdering Philip A. Parsona, who allegedly 
molested him for years. A jury found DeBeer guilty but pleaded for a lenient 
sentence. A judge placed him on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Robb is scheduled to return to court Nov. 13. DAN WEIKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; 
</P>
<P>
CITY WILL SOON BE 370 ACRES BIGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will soon be 370 acres bigger with the annexation of a tract of land 
to the south of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted this month to annex the property, which is owned by Chevron 
USA. The Local Agency Formation Commission some time ago approved putting the 
parcel within La Habra's "sphere of influence." The parcel's southern border is 
the Fullerton city limits, and its northern border is Imperial Highway. It is 
occupied by about two dozen oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron offices and a research facility are situated to the west of the parcel 
and within the La Habra city limits, said Roy N. Ramsland Jr., a city planner. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remaining unincorporated areas in La Habra's sphere of influence 
are occupied by homes. The many pockets of unincorporated land in La Habra were 
the result of choices made by landowners in 1925, when the election creating 
the city was held.

CITY SAYS PERMIT NOT NEEDED FOR GAY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A month after a controversial Gay Pride Festival, city officials have decided a 
permit is not needed for a gay organization to hold its second annual National 
Coming Out Day today at the Plaza of the Flags in the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although a permit was issued for last year's event, sponsored by the Gay and 
Lesbian Community Center of Orange County, city officials now say permits are 
not needed by any group that wants to use the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Gay activists say the city's decision is an effort to sidestep the sort of 
controversy that erupted over last month's Gay Pride Festival, where a wild 
fistfight broke out between radical gay activists and fundamentalist Christians 
after a peaceful gay parade around Centennial Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant City Atty. Richard E. Lay said Santa Ana never had the authority 
to issue permits for the use of the plaza. The city only has a joint operating 
agreement with the county to maintain the plaza, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"What had happened at the festival certainly raised a question about this 
permit. But it turns out that we never had the authority to issue a permit in 
the first place," Lay said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city is revamping all of its permit procedures, said Allen 
Doby, director of the city's Department of Recreation and Community Services. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't grant permits or deny them," said Doby, while denying that the city 
is trying to avoid controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights attorney John J. Duran said the gay community center based in 
Garden Grove applied for a permit on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The city's decision not to issue one indicates that officials are "paranoid," 
said Jeff LeTourneau of the Orange County Visibility League, a gay activist 
group. "This is a repercussion of the festival and it's plain discrimination. 
The city's sole concern is avoiding political controversy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Kuhn, executive director for the gay center, said the city is "skittish" 
about any event that smacks of controversy even though last year's Coming Out 
Day was peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Today's event is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. and will include speeches and a 
candlelight ceremony, Kuhn said. LILY ENG

MASKED YOUTHS BIND VICTIMS, TAKE $20,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Westminster man told police Tuesday that three masked youths entered his 
home, bound and gagged him and a friend and fled with more than $20,000 in cash 
and valuables. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared for me . . . my friend and my two children," 38-year-old Ngoc Le 
said. "I told them (the robbers) I would give them everything . . . if they 
don't kill (us)." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police spokesman Tim Broderson said detectives are investigating 
the incident but said no details were available. 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview with The Times, Le said the incident occurred shortly after 
midday. Le, a storeroom clerk, said he was home on sick leave, nursing stomach 
injuries received in an on-the-job accident involving a forklift. He said he 
was feeding his 6-month-old daughter, Carol, when the doorbell rang. His son, 
Ricky, 4, opened the door. 
</P>
<P>
"One man came in. He (shouted in Vietnamese): 'Close your eyes.' He said if I 
opened my eyes he would kill me," Le said. 
</P>
<P>
Le said two men, wearing white and black masks, bound and gagged him. The other 
bandit stood outside the bathroom door and waited for his friend, Linh Nguyen, 
40, who was taking a shower. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walked out of the bathroom," Nguyen said, "this man pointed a gun to my 
head and told me to shut up." Nguyen, with only a towel around his waist, said 
he was led into the living room where the robbers bound him and placed one of 
his shirts over his face. 
</P>
<P>
"They were going to (bind) Ricky," Le said, "but one of the men told (the 
others) not to." 
</P>
<P>
Le said the robbers took $456 in cash from his pants pockets and a gold 
identification bracelet valued at $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said the bandits took his watch and $82 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
As the bandits barked orders and threats, Le said Carol began to cry. One of 
the robbers placed the baby in an infant walker and ordered Ricky to push her 
around the room to quiet her, he said. "Ricky cry too, but he stop after the 
men tell him they would kill him," Le said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were mad," Le said. "The first man (who entered) said he didn't want to 
kill. He said I was not telling them the truth. He put the gun in my ear. I 
could feel it in my ear. He said he would shoot" if he wasn't told where more 
money was. 
</P>
<P>
Le said that after one of the bandits struck him in his stomach, he directed 
them to a chest of drawers where they took $810 and the Les' two diamond 
wedding rings worth $16,500. 
</P>
<P>
Le said the robbers also made off with his camera, videocassette recorder, Visa 
card and checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
After the robbers fled, Nguyen said they freed themselves and called 
Westminster police. DAVAN MAHARAJ

A GLOBAL ANSWER TO LOCAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston offered a global answer to some of Orange 
County's most pressing local problems Tuesday, suggesting that reforms in the 
Soviet Union might translate into new highways, trauma centers and city police 
officers in California. 
</P>
<P>
In a daylong, campaign-style tour of Orange County, Cranston reminded his 
audiences that the federal government can't pay for such local needs right now 
because it is broke. But, he said, it could find more money in its defense 
budget if it can cut back on the weaponry aimed at the Soviet Union in light of 
the radical changes recently throughout the Communist world. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the enemy in the Soviet Union we thought we had," he told a 
group of developers and housing officials meeting in Santa Ana to discuss the 
homeless crisis. "Yet we are spending $300 billion a year on the military 
budget -- $200 billion of it because of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The changes in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, China and the Soviet Union "could 
free up untold tens of billions of dollars for the things you need," Cranston 
told another audience of the county's top transportation experts in Irvine. 
"That is my main focus in the Senate -- to bring that about primarily for the 
things you need." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's day was billed as a education session for the senator, a chance for 
him to talk with local leaders and community groups about their most difficult 
problems and how the government might help. The senator made similar trips this 
week through Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Cranston talked about offshore oil with city officials in 
Laguna Beach, about trauma care with doctors at UCI Medical Center, and got 
into a lively public session on drugs at a church hall in Anaheim packed with 
more than 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's audiences received his suggestion about reducing the defense budget 
cordially. But in Anaheim, there were raw nerves about the government's 
reaction to the drug problem and catcalls over Cran aston's idea to generate 
money from defense. 
</P>
<P>
One 36-year Anaheim resident told Cranston that he feared he would have to move 
because of the problem. Then he quoted from an exhibit at Disneyland in which a 
robot of President Abraham Lincoln "states that America is only going to be 
destroyed by itself. This drug epidemic is going to destroy it," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Beach, Cranston also pledged to local officials that he will join 
their effort to preserve the area's beautiful coastline. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Beach Hotel, with his back to a panoramic view of the crashing 
surf, Mayor Robert F. Gentry intrigued Cranston with a suggestion that the 
ocean between Orange County and Catalina be made into a national park, 
protecting it from offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who called Laguna Beach "one of the most beautiful places in 
California," said later that he will investigate the idea. He also promised to 
explore the possibility of preventing the development of Laguna Canyon, the 
site of Orange County's most emotional showdown between builders and 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who authored legislation leading to the preservation of several 
hundred acres in nearby Crystal Cove, said he wasn't certain the federal 
government could do anything to prevent the development. But he said, "I think 
it would be nice if it could be saved." DAVE LESHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
A SALUTE FOR FORMER RESIDENT BETTE DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service is being planned on Oct. 20 in Laguna Beach for actress 
Bette Davis, a one-time resident of the city who died of breast cancer in 
France on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Moon, a longtime Laguna Beach resident, said Tuesday that he is arranging 
the "gathering of remembrances" for "friends, acquaintances and fans" of the 
81-year-old actress at Wood Cove Beach. The 5 p.m. event will be held below a 
cliff where Davis once lived. 
</P>
<P>
"In an interview on the Johnny Carson show, she once referred to the Laguna 
Beach residence as her favorite and still thought of it as home," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon said those wishing to participate in the sundown gathering at the end of 
Diamond Street are invited to bring "informal flower offerings." 
</P>

He said the service will include speeches by many longtime residents who knew 
Davis when she worked for one night in the 1957 Laguna Festival of Arts and 
Pageant of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Other Laguna Beach residents remembered Davis fondly. 
</P>
<P>
"She was fascinating and quite a character," said Betsy Paul, who worked with 
the Laguna Playhouse with her husband, David, for 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very gracious lady," added Sally Reeve, a Festival of the Arts 
spokeswoman.

PEOPLE HERBERT J. VIDA: COMING TO GRIPS WITH HIS NEW SPORT WAS HALF THE BATTLE

Jay Lyttle "got dusted," as he calls it, in his first arm-wrestling contest. "I 
also got my eyes open real quick." 
</P>
<P>
The well-muscled Garden Grove machinist, who drew the current champion and a 
former champion for his two matches, got trounced in short order. He also 
discovered that both opponents were professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always big and physical, so I thought I could do it," said Lyttle, who 
was 22 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has never entered another professional tournament, "I think now I 
can beat the pros," said Lyttle, 33, the current world amateur heavyweight 
arm-wrestling champion. 
</P>
<P>
He will defend that title Sunday during Silverado Days at Peak Park in Buena 
Park. Regardless of the outcome, next year he plans to turn professional. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think I will lose," said Lyttle, who weighs 240 pounds. "I've been 
working out three hours a day for nine months, and I'm in real good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Besides workouts, he is forever squeezing a set of hand grips. 
</P>
<P>
"I squeeze them on the way to work, at the gym, at lunchtime, on work breaks 
and at home," said the graduate of Savanna High School in Anaheim, where he 
played football. "I do 2,000 of them every day." 
</P>
<P>
His positive thinking comes from his winning-is-everything attitude: "I've 
always been a physical person, and I didn't know how to lose. . . . I've never 
entered a contest to play. Only to win." 
</P>
<P>
Lyttle still remembers an error he made in Little League that caused his team 
to lose. "That made me a loser, and I can't forget it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While he has shared the glory playing team sports, "I'm in charge when I'm 
arm-wrestling," he said. "Winning is up to me. I have full control of my 
destiny." 
</P>
<P>
When he left high school, "there was nothing for me to do. I didn't go to 
college, so there was no more baseball, track or football. Nothing. Everything 
just dried up, and that was tough because I had always been an athlete and a 
real physical person." 
</P>
<P>
Then an ad in a local newspaper about the arm-wrestling tournament got him 
started. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Lyttle, his wife of 11 years, is his biggest supporter. Before quitting 
to work full time, she was a world's amateur woman's lightweight arm-wrestling 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1982, we were the first husband and wife to win world titles on the same 
day," he said. He later lost his title, only to win it back last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lyttle said he expects arm-wrestling to become an Olympic event someday, but 
not in his time: "It certainly is getting to be a more popular sport." 
</P>
<P>
He said arm-wrestling does rely greatly upon strength, but "it sometimes 
bothers me when people talk about the sport and say you don't have to have 
brains to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Lyttle said arm-wrestling is actually a common-sense thinking game: "You have 
to think fast, because it can be over in a split second." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife and parents, "my friends at work are behind me and will be 
there Sunday," he said. "I need something to fuel me, and they get the fire 
built up in me." 
</P>
<P>
He may also need them later. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got something on the back burners," Lyttle said. "I'm thinking about bull 
riding." 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, a cruise director asked artist Hilda Pierce to teach painting 
on a ship in exchange for a free trip. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel resident agreed. Two of her first students happened to be the 
wife and daughter of the chairman of the cruise line, who liked her artwork -- 
so much, in fact, that the chairman chose the abstract impressionist artist as 
one of three painters paid a total of $2 million for their work, which now 
hangs in the Carnival Cruise Lines' 2,600-passenger liner Fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said she created 1,296 original pieces of art. "I worked seven days a 
week for three years," the former Art Institute of Chicago student said.

MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE SUES REGISTER FOR LIBEL

Municipal Judge Calvin Schmidt, who is targeted in a corruption probe, filed a 
libel suit against the Orange County Register on Tuesday, contending the 
newspaper printed unfounded allegations that he gave lenient treatment to two 
prostitutes in exchange for sex. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt, 59, one of six Harbor Municipal Court judges who has come under 
scrutiny by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, seeks unspecified 
damages against the Register, contending it published false allegations about 
him in a series of articles that began last October. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend our 
articles," said Register Editor N. Christian Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In a closed hearing last summer, the Commission on Judicial Performance 
investigated allegations against Schmidt, but no decision has yet been 
rendered. The commission's probe of another Harbor Court Judge, Brian R. 
Carter, was dropped when he retired from the Newport Beach post in February. 
</P>
<P>
Many details of the commission's investigation into Schmidt, Carter and other 
Harbor Court judges were published in other newspapers, including The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In a Superior Court lawsuit, Schmidt claimed the accusations in the Register 
were made recklessly and without adequate investigation. Before the Register 
published the stories, it had been advised "by other judges that they, and not 
Judge Schmidt, were the ones involved," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Register also ignored matters of public record known to it or accessible 
to it that the sentences involved were consistent with published Harbor Court 
policy, and Orange County rules, and as a matter of law were not favorable 
decisions, but rather normal decisions," the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says the Register was notified of the errors verbally on many 
occasions. In addition, Schmidt's attorney submitted a written demand for a 
clarification of a March 10 article, but none was printed, according to the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
In that story, X-rated film star Pamela Weston said she had testified before 
the Orange County grand jury that a friend of Schmidt's "might have" interceded 
with Schmidt on her behalf when she was arrested on prostitution charges in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Weston's 10-day jail sentence was reduced to 10 days of community service. The 
Register said the grand jury was trying to determine whether Schmidt reduced 
the term in exchange for sex. In interviews with the Register, Weston denied 
sexual involvement with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 13 letter to Register Editor Anderson, attorney H. Warren Siegel 
said the Register knew that Harbor Court Municipal Judge Frances Munoz, not 
Judge Schmidt, reduced Weston's sentence and made no mention of that in its 
story. Siegel demanded a published clarification of the story. 
</P>
<P>
In other stories, the Register reported that Schmidt allegedly offered to 
reinstate the driver's license of convicted prostitute Della Christine Johnson 
in 1984 in exchange for a promise of sex. She told police that Judge Carter 
later collected on that promise by having sex with her. Carter denied it.

MOTORISTS IGNORE PLEA OF HIT-AND-RUN VICTIM

<P>
A 32-year-old Laguna Hills woman, the victim of a hit-and-run accident on 
Interstate 5 in El Toro Monday night, said she stood on the freeway covered 
with blood and waved her arms at oncoming traffic for about 10 minutes but no 
passing motorist stopped to help. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Marcari said Tuesday that the accident occurred at 8:30 p.m. Monday 
while she was traveling north on Interstate 5 near the Lake Forest Drive exit. 
She said her pale yellow 1979 Alpha Romeo was struck from behind by a large 
truck and knocked across three lanes of traffic before it slammed into the 
central guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
After the shock of the collision wore off, Marcari said she looked around but 
saw no sign of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out of the car. I was covered with blood, I was screaming and nobody 
stopped," she said. "I was waving my arms." 
</P>
<P>
After about 10 minutes, a California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer stopped 
and summoned help, said Marcari, who underwent plastic surgery for facial cuts 
and a broken nose at Saddleback Hospital and Health Center in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While Marcari was upset that no motorist stopped to help, Ken Daily, a 
spokesman for the CHP office in San Juan Capistrano, said drivers might not 
have been able to see that Marcari was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"You're zipping along at 65 or 70 like most of them do, and you might not 
notice anything," Daily said. Because Marcari's car was facing oncoming 
traffic, Marcari would have been silhouetted against her car's headlights, 
making it difficult for drivers to see that she was bloodied, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the CHP in Santa Ana, which is handling the investigation, is 
asking any witnesses to the accident to call Officer Rocky Hamilton in the 
Santa Ana office at (714) 547-8311.

SUPERVISORS OPEN DOOR TO SUE VENTURA COUNTY FOR TRIAL COSTS

The Orange County Board of Supervisors Tuesday gave its attorneys the go-ahead 
to sue Ventura County for $169,000 in expenses, which they say are owed from 
the trial of convicted child killer Theodore Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Frank was convicted in late 1979 for the abduction, rape and torture slaying of 
2-year-old Amy Sue Seitz. The child was abducted from her aunt's house in 
Camarillo in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's case was moved to Orange County because of extensive pretrial 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Lon Watson, Orange County assistant county counsel, said the supervisors voted 
unanimously to try to recoup costs from the trial because the statute of 
limitations was about to expire. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest in 1978, Frank was a convicted child molester who had 
been released from Atascadero State Hospital just six weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Frank was sentenced to die at San Quentin for the Amy Sue Seitz murder. But six 
years later his death sentence was overturned by the state Supreme Court, and a 
second penalty trial was held. Frank again was sentenced to die and sent back 
to San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said the disputed expenses were incurred since 1985.

Defending champion Randy Snow of Birmingham, Ala., advanced to the third round 
of the U.S. Open Championship of wheelchair tennis Tuesday with a 6-1, 6-2 
victory over Thierry Callier of France. 
</P>
<P>
Snow's victory was the highlight of the first full day of singles competition

BRAZILIAN WATER POLO STAR TURNS GOLDEN WEST INTO STATE POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Rabello made a few changes in his life last August. 
</P>
<P>
He packed up, left his family in Brazil and moved to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped playing water polo for the Brazilian junior national team and 
started playing for Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
While these might seem like major life-style changes to most, Rabello sees them 
as part of his plan to earn a degree and play water polo for a Division I 
college in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my goal," said Rabello, 19. "If I have something in mind to do, I don't 
resist. I go after it, and this is what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rabello started swimming before he was 2 and was competing by age 7. He started 
playing water polo at age 11 in his home town of Rio de Janeiro, and became a 
member of the junior national team at 15. He graduated from high school in 
December 1987, but continued playing for the junior national team. He attended 
college, but the team took up most of his time. 
</P>
<P>
Rabello was recruited by several American colleges, including UCLA, Pepperdine 
and the University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
He visited Southern California last spring in an effort to find a place to 
play. But being in the United States wasn't all that big a deal to him. He 
previously had been in the United States twice, coming in 1980 with his family 
to go to Disneyland and to play in a tournament in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During this trip, UCLA Coach Bob Horn told Rabello that he would be better off 
playing at a community college for a year to get his grades in order. Community 
colleges have easier entrance requirements for foreign students than most 
four-year schools. Rabello knew some people who had played at UCLA and they 
told him Golden West would be a good place to go for a year. 
</P>
<P>
So, he called Golden West Coach Ken Hamdorf and said he was coming in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Rabello has been a big part of Golden West's early-season success. The 
Rustlers are 18-1 and ranked third in the state. Golden West's only loss was to 
second-ranked Cuesta, 12-9, early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Rabello, who is the hole-man for Golden West, leads the team with 78 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been offensive-minded," he said. "But I like to play defense as 
well. I want people to think of me as a well-rounded player." 
</P>
<P>
Breaker, Breaker: Saddleback's football team has had plenty of problems this 
season, losing its first three games. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a 15-14 victory over Mt. San Antonio Saturday there were some 
unexpected problems of a strange nature. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos had recovered a fumble at the Mt. SAC 26 with about a minute left 
in the first half. Saddleback assistant coach Bill Cunerty then tried to call a 
play from the press box. 
</P>
<P>
But his wireless head set was picking up police and fire calls and he couldn't 
be heard by Saddleback Coach Ken Swearingen. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept trying to call the play, and I was getting someone saying 'Breaker, 
10-4,' " Cunerty said. "The way it was going, I was expecting to hear Gage and 
DeSoto (of the television show 'Emergency') next." 
</P>
<P>
Football poll: El Camino (4-0) remains in the No. 1 spot in the weekly 
Southland Poll. The Warriors rolled past Golden West, 38-14, Saturday and are 
averaging 35.8 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (4-0) is second. The Dons lead the conference in scoring, 
averaging 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (4-0) is third, Moorpark (4-0) fourth, Ventura (4-0) fifth, Orange 
Coast (3-1) sixth, Bakersfield (2-0-2) seventh, Los Angeles Southwestern 
(3-0-1) eighth, Long Beach (3-1) ninth, and Pasadena (3-1) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Golden West and Orange Coast, two of the top water polo teams in the state, 
meet today in a nonconference atch at 3 at Golden West. Golden West is favored 
to win the South Coast Conference and Orange Coast (14-3), ranked fourth in the 
state, is the pick in the Orange Empire Conference. It will be the second time 
the teams have met this season. Golden West defeated the Pirates, 10-9, 
Saturday in a pool-play tournament. The Rustlers also beat Ventura, 16-4, and 
Palomar, 12-4. DeAnza is the top-ranked team and Cuesta is second. Cypress 
(15-4), which is ranked fifth, also swept three matches over the weekend.

BIKINI-MAKER RAISIN CO. INC. EXPANDS INTO MEN'S APPAREL 
</P>

<P>
Cross a bikini with a wet suit and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
A company that is well-built for competition and warming to the challenge. In 
other words, the newly expanded Raisin Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Raisins -- for years one of the hottest bikini labels on the beach -- has 
acquired San Clemente-based Trestles Inc., the manufacturer and marketer of Rip 
Curl wet suits and beachwear in North America. 
</P>
<P>
The deal marks the first time a maker of women's beachwear has taken over a 
manufacturer of men's apparel. According to several industry sources, it 
creates a company with combined sales of more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, completed Sept. 30, gives Raisin the licensing rights for Rip 
Curl in North America, Guam, Canada, Mexico and the Virgin Islands. San Juan 
Capistrano-based Raisin also bought the Rip Curl Surf Center, a San Clemente 
retail outlet. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Raisin also purchased from Rip Curl the U.S. 
distributorships for Ocean &amp; Earth and Balin, two small companies that 
manufacture surf accessories, and the North American licensing rights to 
manufacture and distribute Peak, an Australian-based wet-suit maker. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was for an undisclosed amount of cash, said Tom Lingo, chief 
executive, who owns Raisin along with his wife, president Pat Lingo, and Hugh 
Blue, the chief operating officer. Lingo declined to reveal the stock price. 
But he said Australia-based Rip Curl International received a note that is 
convertible into an equity interest in the combined company, if certain 
unspecified events occur. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, regarded by many as the nation's swimwear-making capital, 
Raisin's styles have been quietly influencing larger companies for years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Raisin evolved from just a swimsuit maker into a manufacturer of 
complete beachwear outfits, known in the industry as "active wear," with a 
product line that includes rayon pants and knit tops and bottoms. The company 
quickly emerged as the women's beachwear market's largest maker of swimwear for 
specialty shops -- at the same time enjoying phenomenal growth. 
</P>
<P>
Although industry retailers and competitors say that the firm's influence has 
declined in recent seasons, the Raisins label -- along with a second line of 
casual sportswear, Leilani Jones -- today is sold at 2,700 specialty stores 
throughout the United States, as well as in Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Rip Curl, on the other hand, started as an Australian surfboard company in the 
'60s. The company gradually began making wet suits and sold its North American 
license to Trestles in 1979. Trestles, which does business in the United States 
as Rip Curl, had been owned by its two Australian principals and Rod "Butch" 
Barr, who heads the San Clemente-based operation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rip Curl's Orange County operations include warehouse and manufacturing 
facilities for wet suits in Oceanside and executive offices in San Clemente. It 
is the second-biggest name among hard-core surfers for wet suits and is sold at 
about 450 small, specialty stores across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lingo stressed that Rip Curl and Raisin will remain separate, with Rip Curl 
operating as an autonomous division of the bikini manufacturer. The combined 
companies have about 150 employees.

Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a national securities rating firm, has upgraded 
its evaluation of certificates of deposit at Downey Savings &amp; Loan and two 
industrial revenue bonds totaling $6 million that are secured by loan 
agreements with the Newport Beach institution. 
</P>
<P>
The higher rating reflects Downey's "conservative asset mix, excellent asset 
quality, strong capital levels and good profitability," S &amp; P said. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds are issued by two Arizona counties. 
</P>
<P>
Downey has been an active construction lender and real estate investor, 
primarily in neighborhood shopping centers in California and Arizona. Those 
activities have raised its risk profile but also have contributed increasingly 
to its net income. Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer

Now that the season is over for the California Angels, catcher-outfielder Brian 
Downing will be going to bat for American Commerce National Bank in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, a bank customer, recently signed a one-year contract to act as a 
spokesman for American Commerce at its various community projects and a greeter 
at bank functions, such as Sunday's five-kilometer and 10-kilometer Run for 
Health events. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very involved in community activities, and we've used Brian and other 
athletes on an informal basis before to greet people and mingle with them," 
said L. Don Sargent, the bank's president. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've formalized the relationship," he said. He would 
not disclose how much the bank is paying Downing. Compiled by James S.

University Savings Bank figures it may find its niche by jumping into a risky 
but potentially lucrative business that many savings and loans are leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The small S&amp;L, which moved its headquarters to Newport Beach from Fresno 
early this year, has tentatively agreed to purchase a 75% stake in a shell 
company that would invest directly in residential and commercial real estate 
projects, mostly with partners. 
</P>
<P>
A University subsidiary, Unicap Inc., would acquire its stake in California 
Venture Group in Sherman Oaks for $500,000 and move the operation to Newport 
Beach, the S&amp;L said. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and 
completion of a definitive agreement. The investment would give the unit 
$675,000 to launch its business. 
</P>
<P>
Many S&amp;Ls with direct investments are reining in those activities or even 
shutting down operations because new federal law does not allow them to list 
their investments as part of their regulatory capital, which is the minimum 
amount they must have as their final reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
University is well capitalized and can afford to use a small part of its 
capital to engage in limited direct investments, said Thomas J. Bernard, the 
S&amp;L's chairman, president and chief executive. After its purchase, 
University would still have about $4 million in capital, which would more than 
support its $80 million in assets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"An important point is that the legislation does curtail especially smaller 
S&amp;Ls from doing direct investments and that's going to create a significant 
shortage of cash available to small builders," Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary would capitalize on that cash shortage, he said, by investing $1 
million to $2 million in each joint venture it forms with small builders to 
develop small real estate projects in Southern California and the Fresno area, 
where the 3-year-old University Savings maintains its original branch. Compiled

NEWPORT'S ART MUSEUM FORMS MERGER PANEL

<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum has formed a four-member committee to explore a 
closer alliance, perhaps a merger, with the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken in response to the creation of a similar committee by the 
Laguna Art Museum. Laguna committee chairwoman Claudette Y. Shaw had requested 
a discussion with the Newport museum about whether "any type of merger would 
appear to be advantageous" to the county's two best-known museums, according to 
Thomas H. Nielsen, president of the Newport museum's board. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen named Trustee Jay M. Young to chair the Newport museum's committee, 
which also includes trustees James B. Pick, Tom Peckenpaugh and Trustee 
Emeritus Jane Lawson. Peckenpaugh is chairman of Santa Ana's Discovery Museum, 
formed from the merger of two children's institutions in the county, the 
Experience Center and the Exploratory Learning Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee's aim is to explore what the possible affiliations may be and to 
see if we can work out some arrangement advantageous to both institutions," 
Young said. "I have no preconceived ideas" about what might transpire at the 
first meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chairing the Laguna museum's committee is Trustee Kenneth Heintz. The other 
members are trustees Mary Hendrickson and Thomas Magill. No date has been set 
for its first meeting, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Shaw has stressed repeatedly that any discussion of a merger would be 
exploratory, she has said "it does seem that some sort of alliance would serve 
(both museums) well." The Laguna museum, which has an annual operating budget 
of $1.2 million, has been plagued by a persistent deficit that totalled $72,000 
during the last fiscal year. The Newport museum is in the midst of a 
$50-million drive to build a new facility in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw also has said that any merger most likely would combine adminsitrative 
services and fund-raising efforts, rather than mix the museums' collections 
into a single facility. Though many of the changes therefore would be behind 
the scenes, she said, consolidation could result in jointly organized, bigger 
or more comprehensive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"The proponents of the (merger) see some way of combining our administrations," 
she said. "That way, both of us could keep our expenses to a minimum and keep 
(fund-raising efforts) under one administration so that we would not compete 
with each other."

HE CATCHES THOSE SPECIAL MOMENTS IN TIME

Inherent to the art of photography is the sense of fear that occurs when you 
glimpse something that may never happen again. The photographer may have only a 
fraction of a second or, perhaps, the fraction of a week, to capture on film a 
moment that should be held forever. 
</P>
<P>
This sense of fleeting opportunity causes photographers to fight the elements 
or battle the landscape all for the chance to catch a ray of sunlight peeking 
through a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
It's also what separates the average photographer from the memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Larry Vogel is especially adept at finding such moments, whether 
they be on the coast of Oregon, the mountains of Yosemite or the beaches of 
Corona del Mar. An exhibit of his black-and-white photographs, "The Landscape, 
a Personal Vision," is on display at the Susan Spiritus Gallery in Costa Mesa 
through Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The 35 images, ranging in size from 8-by-10 to 20-by-24 inches, show off the 
Westminster-based photographer's attention to detail and quality. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel's work, shot with his 4-by-5-inch format camera, follows a more-or-less 
conventional style with full tonal range such as his pair of 20-by-24-inch 
photographs "Tree and Tenaya Creek" and "Bowed Tree Snow and Bridge," which 
were shot in Yosemite and feature two looks at the same location -- during 
spring and winter. 
</P>
<P>
The two photographs fit like bookends, the curve of the bowed tree drawing the 
eye toward both images. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs with higher contrast include an unusual shot, "Trees &amp; Fog," 
shot at Lake Hodges in San Diego. The photo has a horizontal layer of fog that 
obscures the middle of the image. In the background is a silhouetted tree with 
birds. The rich black-and-white portions make it the most striking work in the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
A photo entitled "Sunset," taken along the Oregon coast, has a dramatic flair, 
with black, silhouetted jagged rock formations protruding out of the surf and 
contrasting a white sky. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel, 32, did spend time closer to home, as evidenced in four images from 
Huntington Central Park in Huntington Beach.

Other works include images of bark-stripped aspens, old fences, pine trees, 
sand dunes, an icy lake, the Long Beach skyline, oak trees on Yosemite's El 
Capitan and other assorted rocks and roots. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the images are well crafted and compositionally sound. They aren't, 
however, exhibited as effectively as they might be. The photos are packed 
together tightly on the walls of the gallery, leaving it difficult to view the 
works individually. Fewer photographs, with a tighter edit would have been more 
effective.

 The Landscape, A Personal Vision, black-and-white photographs by Larry Vogel 
continues through Oct. 20 at the Susan Spiritus Gallery in Crystal Court 
section of South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Monday though Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. 
Admission is free. Information: (714) 549-7550.

THIS 'ALICE' INVITES THE AUDIENCE ALONG ON HER ADVENTURES;

The grown-ups call it environmental theater, but don't let that highbrow talk 
scare you: The Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre is offering a children's play 
that lets kids be kids. And this is one "Alice in Wonderland" that you can 
really get behind -- or in front of or beside if you prefer. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental theater means site-specific," said Jody Davidson, Laguna 
Playhouse general manager and co-director of the show with Scott Davidson and 
Joe Lauderdale. "This production of 'Alice' was designed just for the space 
where we're performing, so the audience literally follows Alice through her 
adventure in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
The production is being staged outdoors six times daily each weekend through 
Oct. 22 at Annaliese's Willowbrook School, a private preschool in Laguna 
Canyon. In groups of 40, the audience tags along with Alice, meeting and 
greeting the more than a dozen eccentric characters she encounters on her 
surrealistic trip. Theatergoers get to chat with the loony Duchess and her 
crazed cook, and dance the Lobster Quadrille with the Dodo, Mock Turtle and 
Gryphon. They can swap puns with the Mad Hatter and March Hare, and referee a 
spat between the Tweedles, Dee and Dum. And they wrap up the tour in a rigged 
but riotous game of croquet with the Queen of Hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Bring your walking shoes for this one. During the course of the show, the 
audience puts in almost half a mile. You'll climb a gentle hillside, maneuver 
through ramps and whoosh down a slide. (The more vertically inclined can take 
the stairs instead.) 
</P>
<P>
This production was adapted from a presentation by the Rainbow Company, a 
children's group in Las Vegas, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes were designed by South Coast Repertory regular Dwight Richard 
Odle, and they are delightfully off kilter. The Duchess looks especially sharp 
in her candy-striped tights, ratty doggie slippers and frowzy dust cap cum 
tiara. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, although generally true to the Lewis Carroll text, has been pared 
down and sprinkled with lots of off-the-cuff remarks to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, if you're talking about the perfect children's story, 'Alice in 
Wonderland' really isn't," Davidson said. "It's very talky . . . much of the 
dialogue is puns or very literary references. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mad Hatter's tea party, for example, is really a lot of bad puns. The 
parents enjoy the puns, but the kids like the action and the crazy characters." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of characters, don't come to this "Alice" looking for Disney's 
sugar-and-spice miss. This girl is of pluckier stock, a no-nonsense young lady 
who knows her manners but doesn't hesitate to speak her mind when the situation 
calls for straight talk. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers Alexis Mirman, Heather deMichele and Tamara Hoffman rotate in the 
role of Alice. Tony Kaufman and Ryan Baron alternate as the White Rabbit. The 
rest of the characters are single-cast. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 25 cast members, the youngest of whom is 9, were chosen from the 
Laguna Playhouse Young Ensemble, a theater education program for children. 
According to Davidson, the ensemble chooses children 7 through 17 to 
participate, and they study all aspects of the theater, including set and 
costume design. There is no tuition, but students are required to work on all 
Youth Theatre productions. 
</P>
<P>
"They help out on every show we do," Davidson said. "For 'Alice,' the box 
office and props department are run by kids, and the stage manager is a child. 
When we do shows in our regular theater, the kids even run the lights and 
sound. The kid you see in the lead in one show may usher in the next. They 
understand theater is a collaborative art." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre program was recently named the country's 
most outstanding new youth theater by the American Alliance for Theatre and 
Education, a national children's theater group. 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse also offers other theater classes for children 4 through 17, and 
it coordinates an acting program for handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
"Alice in Wonderland" is the first of five Youth Theatre productions this 
season. Also scheduled for an off-site performance is "The Best Christmas 
Pageant Ever," a comedy by Barbara Robinson. To be staged at Moulton Theatre in 
Lagu;na Beach are the world premiere of "Draw Fire," a drama by Brian Kral; 
"The Code Breaker," a science fiction play by Pauline Conley, and "The 
Bluebird," the classic children's story by Maurice Maeterlinck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre production of "Alice in Wonderland" runs 
through Oct. 22. Show times are noon, 12:40, 1:20, 3, 3:40 and 4:20 p.m. 
Saturdays and Sundays. Annaliese'sWillowbrook School is at 20062 Laguna Canyon 
Road, Laguna Beach. Tickets are $8 general and $5 for children under 13, and 
they may be purchased in advance by calling (714) 494-8021 or (714) 494-0743. A 
limited number of tickets may be available at the door. Strollers are not 
permitted, and long pants and comfortable shoes are recommended.

<P>
The House narrowly voted today to add cases of rape and incest to the 
circumstances in which poor women can have government-funded abortions, 
approving language that President Bush has vowed to veto. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional debate came during action on spending bills for the Labor and 
Health and Human Services departments and the District of Columbia, both of 
which have been threatened with vetoes over abortion questions. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate now must act on the compromise bills that worked out differences 
between House and Senate versions of the legislation 
</P>
<P>
The key abortion vote came on a motion by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) 
asking the House to reverse itself and go along with the Senate on the 
Labor-HHS bill by adding to the standard "life of the mother" cases incidents 
of rape and incest. She prevailed, 216 to 206. In a second vote, Boxer won, 212 
to 207.

An infant boy who was taken from his mother at Mercy General Hospital just 
hours after his birth was discovered safe today at a Sacramento home and a 
woman has been arrested as a suspect in the kidnaping, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the child appeared to be in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-pound, 1-ounce baby was taken from its mother Monday night by a woman 
dressed in a yellow visitor's smock. The woman told the 15-year-old Hmong 
mother, who speaks limited English, that it was feeding time and took the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief John Kearns said a woman has been arrested in connection with the 
abduction and was being questioned. He did not identify her. 
</P>
<P>
"A female is being questioned," Kearns said. "She has claimed she had a baby in 
Kaiser Hospital Monday night," but Kearns said Kaiser did not substantiate the 
woman's story.

KING REPORTED WITH WOMEN ON LAST NIGHT

<P>
Martin Luther King Jr. spent part of the night before his assassination with 
two women and fought with a third, according to the memoirs of the Rev. Ralph 
D. Abernathy, his best friend and chief aide. 
</P>
<P>
"And The Walls Came Tumbling Down," published this month, chronicles 
Abernathy's life as a preacher and civil rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
Detailing the night before King's April 4, 1968, assassination in Memphis, 
Tenn., Abernathy wrote that after King's "I have been to the mountaintop" 
address in Memphis, King, Abernathy and a colleague went to the home of a 
friend of King's. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy said King and the woman came out of the bedroom after 1 a.m., 
according to an advance copy of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at the Lorraine Motel where King was shot, King got together with a 
Kentucky state legislator to whom he was close, Abernathy wrote. He added that 
King did not return to the room he shared with Abernathy until after 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Later that morning, King asked Abernathy to mediate a dispute between King and 
another young woman King knew well who apparently had come looking for King in 
the middle of the night and couldn't find him, the book said. 
</P>
<P>
In an ensuing argument, King shouted at the woman and "knocked her across the 
bed," Abernathy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Abernathy explained why he felt compelled to write of "my friend's 
weakness for women." 
</P>
<P>
"Much has been written" about the subject, he said, and he wanted to "make some 
attempt to render justice to the dead without causing too much unnecessary pain 
to the living." 
</P>
<P>
King "believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It 
was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation," 
Abernathy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"He was . . . a man who attracted women, even when he didn't intend to, and 
attracted them in droves," Abernathy added. "He was a hero -- the greatest hero 
of his age -- and women are always attracted to a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Stoney Johnson, a spokesman at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent 
Social Change in Atlanta, said he believes that King's widow, Coretta Scott 
King, and other family members have not yet read Abernathy's book.

NBC "Today" show co-anchor Jane Pauley said she probably will leave the program 
by the end of the year but will stay with the network "in some fashion or 
other," the Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely staying at NBC," Pauley told the newspaper in a telephone 
interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said an announcement concerning Pauley would be 
made in two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley has co-anchored "Today" for 13 years, but her future with the program 
has been the subject of speculation in the weeks since Deborah Norville took 
over as newscaster on the program. Pauley told the newspaper there has not been 
hostility among members of the "Today" show cast, although she did say the 
place has been more tense since Norville swapped duties with John Palmer, who 
has been sent to "NBC News at Sunrise."

Stock prices lost more ground in profit-taking today, continuing the pullback 
that began in Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 Tuesday, dropped another 
11.97 points to 2,773.36. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to cash in their 
gains after the market's rise to record highs last week and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a dimming of hopes for 
any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy. Interest 
rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes of some stimulus from 
the Fed, rose in today's credit-market activity.

The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 1/16 point, or 62 cents 
for every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield was unchanged from 
late Tuesday at 8.01%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some traders continued to sell bonds to cash in gains made in 
last week's strong rally, but there were no fresh developments moving the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Market participants are looking toward Friday's scheduled government report on 
wholesale price inflation for September as a possible source of direction for 
bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were 1/32 point lower to 1/32 point higher, intermediate maturities were 
unchanged to 1/16 point lower, and 20-year issues had slipped 1/16 point, 
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was down 0.43 at 1,184.85. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials also declined. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, had fallen 0.28 to 
333.64. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yields Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.94% as the discount jumped 7 
basis points to 7.69%. Yields on six-month bills increased to 8.08% as the 
discount advanced 8 basis points to 7.67%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 
8.05% as the discount edged up 1 basis point to 7.51%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 7/8%, unchanged from late Tuesday.

Hourly workers at Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corp. have voted for fat cash 
bonuses for themselves for perfect attendance and automatic dismissal for 
anyone missing 15 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, held Monday and Tuesday, is the latest effort to curb high 
absenteeism, which auto makers regard as a serious roadblock, to boost quality 
and cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 1,120 to 434, United Auto Workers Local 3000 chose a "no-fault" 
absenteeism policy, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The policy calls for an annual $1,500 bonus for perfect attendance, 60% of 
regular pay on the first four absences per year and automatic dismissal after 
15 absences, or 6.25% of scheduled work days annually. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, workers would be eligible for 15 sick days or personal days 
each year, not including holidays, vacations or pre-approved sick days. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, workers rejected a plan that included a $500 bonus for 
perfect attendance, 60% of regular pay for the first 14 absences per year and 
termination after the 15th absence.

DUTCH COMPANY TO BUY A&amp;M RECORDS

The PolyGram BV unit of Dutch-based NV Philips has agreed to acquire A&amp;M 
Records, owned by trumpet player Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, for about $500 
million, PolyGram officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of A&amp;M, founded 27 years ago by Alpert and Moss, is the 
latest in a long-running series of foreign buyouts of U.S. record companies. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram, which says it is the world's third largest music group, said it will 
acquire all of A&amp;M's record operations plus its music video interests, its 
Los Angeles offices, including the former Charlie Chaplin film studios, and the 
A&amp;M recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Music Publishing Excluded 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition does not include A&amp;M's music publishing interests. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram said the two founders of A&amp;M and its president, Gil Friesen, will 
continue their day-to-day roles at the company after the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeing the demise of the independent record company, rather the 
emergence of a new brand of independent," said David Fine, PolyGram's 
president. He said the deal will give A&amp;M "the resources and marketing 
infrastructure of a major worldwide group." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Fine declined to state a precise price for the buyout but 
said speculation that it was about $500 million "is in the ballpark." A&amp;M 
had sales of about $300 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M, one of the last privately held major labels, has a talent roster that 
includes Janet Jackson, Sting, Toni Childs, Joe Jackson, Al Green and Brenda 
Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert and Moss, who used their initials to name the company, founded it in 
1962 in the garage of Alpert's home in a Los Angeles suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert told reporters that he was "excited about this situation" and that it 
would give A&amp;M "more visibility and more muscle" competing for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the right move at the right time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram has been interested in expanding in the United States, Fine said. 
Earlier this year it acquired Island Records Ltd., which specializes in rap and 
reggae music, for an estimated $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram already distributes A&amp;M records in Europe; RCA records is the 
label's American distributor. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram, 90% owned by Dutch electronics giant NV Philips, bought Island 
Records in August for around $300 million. PolyGram's artists include Bon Jovi, 
Fine Young Cannibals, U2, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Music: PolyGram offers about $500 million for company co-founded by trumpeter 
Herb Alpert.

Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said today he was lukewarm about reentering the 
race to take control of Hollywood film studio MGM/UA Communications Co., which 
terminated a $1.5-billion pact to be bought by Qintex Australia Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
MGM said its deal with the Australian broadcasting conglomerate Qintex failed 
because it did not deliver a required $50-million letter of credit. (Section D, 
Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch was asked on Australian television if he still wanted MGM/UA after 
Qintex Australia's plan fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, yes," he said. "But we're not negotiating. We're not in there. We're not 
sure about it. . . . We're not lusting after it." 
</P>
<P>
A bid of $1.35 billion by Murdoch's News Corp. was topped by Qintex last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly not going to pay the price (Qintex head) Mr. (Christopher C.) 
Skase was going to pay," Murdoch said.

A Swiss Alps training camp for 12 top East German athletes was canceled 
abruptly by the country's track federation "for financial reasons, among 
others," it was revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
Ursula Cina, spokeswoman for Leukerbad's tourism office, said an official telex 
from East Berlin on Tuesday said the athletes, including eight Olympic and 
world champions, will not attend a three-week "training and rehabilitation 
camp" starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Leukerbad officials had announced Monday that the East Germans would come to 
this mountain resort and spa. 
</P>
<P>
Cina said East German officials gave no other explanation than in the brief 
telex saying, "We regret to inform you that for financial reasons, among 
others, we cannot make use of this opportunity for a rehabilitation and 
training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Joachim Krebs, the East German federation's deputy general secretary, said the 
reasons for canceling were "complicated" and added, "There are no political 
reasons."

Former Boston Red Sox superstar Luis Tiant has signed up to play with the Gold 
Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Assn., the Florida club said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his proven major league abilities and experience, we feel he will 
be a major asset to our ballclub," said Jim Block, general manager of the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to have signed with the Suns," Tiant said. "I am looking 
forward to getting back into baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Training camp opens Monday for the Suns. The team is based in Pompano Beach and 
will play some home games in Miami at Miami Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The league's season runs through November, December and January. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-born Tiant, 49, amassed 229 wins and 172 losses during a 19-year 
career in the major leagues; he pitched in more than 570 games and 3,400 
innings. He had four 20-win seasons: 1968, 1973, 1974 and 1976.

About 2.1 million callers hoping to buy tickets to the Bay Bridge World Series

"The last earthquake we had did not generate this type of calling," said 
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Judy Peterson. Dial tones were delayed Tuesday morning 
from Sonoma to Santa Clara to Sacramento as baseball fans jammed telephone 
lines. The callers were seeking 4,000 tickets that went on sale at 9 a.m. for 
the three San Francisco Giants' home games at Candlestick Park. 
</P>

BASS-Ticketmaster, which handled the sales exclusively by telephone, said all

Five members of Canada's national soccer team took thousands of dollars in 
bribes to throw a tournament in Singapore in 1986, one of the players involved 
in the deal told CBC-TV's "Fifth Estate" Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Paul James, 26, of Oakville, Ontario, said a friendly game of cards among 
himself, Igor Vrablic of Waterloo, Ontario; David Norman of Coquitlam, British 
Columbia; Chris Cheuden of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Hector Marinaro of 
Mississauga, Ontario, turned into a conspiracy to throw Canada's semifinal game 
against North Korea for $15,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal broke in November, 1987, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
charged Vrablic, Norman, Cheuden and Marinaro with accepting bribes to affect 
the outcome of an international tournament. James was to be granted immunity to 
testify as a Crown witness. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were dropped, however, when a judge ruled that the Criminal Code could 
not be enforced outside Canada and that, therefore, whatever happened in 
Singapore was out of the court's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
James, Vrablic, Norman and Marinaro have been playing soccer in Canada since 
the charges were dropped. Cheuden has played in the United States.
