LAWYER VIEWS REMAP CASE AS ONLY 1ST STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To attorney Richard P. Fajardo, the Los Angeles County redistricting case 
involves much more than putting a Latino on the Board of Supervisors for the 
first time in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Fajardo, who represents the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
in a Voting Rights Act suit against the county, said victory for his side will 
spur Latino political organization throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think we're going to do with the suit is to open opportunities here," 
Fajardo said during an interview in the MALDEF office in downtown Los Angeles. 
Near him were 10 volumes, each with a red cover, containing the transcript of 
the landmark trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Federal District Judge David V. Kenyon ruled in June that the county had 
violated the Voting Rights Act by discriminating against Latinos in the drawing 
of the five supervisorial districts in 1981. In August, Kenyon threw out a 
newly proposed county plan, saying it contained "nonsensical distortion," and 
he accepted a district alignment proposed by MALDEF. 
</P>
<P>
But that was just the first phase of the case, and Fajardo has a lot of work 
ahead of him. An appellate court is reviewing Kenyon's decision, which means 
more courtroom work for Fajardo and the other lawyers in the case. The 
plaintiffs also include the U.S. Justice Department and the American Civil 
Liberties Union. The case could go to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
As Fajardo sees it, MALDEF's involvement in the suit is part of the 
organization's nationwide effort to put Latinos in elected office. In Texas, 
where MALDEF was involved in similar litigation, there are now 6,000 Latino 
elected officials, twice as many as in California. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos make up a third of Los Angeles County's population, but no Latino has 
served on the powerful board since 1875. A Latino Los Angeles County 
supervisor, Fajardo said, would stimulate voting registration and applications 
for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians will persuade people to become citizens so they can build a 
(political) base," he said. And, he said, in the high-visibility job of Los 
Angeles County supervisor, a Latino would be in a good position to run for 
statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he said, the lawsuit will alert politicians that MALDEF will not stand 
for discrimination against Latinos when the Legislature and cities and counties 
around the state reapportion districts next year. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to Los Angeles County, he said, political leaders will begin to talk 
"about health problems in East Los Angeles . . . the alternatives to closing 
clinics. And you'll see more Latino businessmen dealing with the county." 
</P>
<P>
Those are among the reasons for MALDEF's intensity in pursuing the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
That is why it resisted demands by the supervisors that the suit be dropped and 
that both sides wait for completion of the 1990 U.S. Census to draw up new 
districts. Why push the suit, county attorneys argued, when the census will 
produce new population figures? 
</P>
<P>
And MALDEF rejected the point made by Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane 
Dana that the fact that Latina Sarah Flores finished first in June's primary 
election for the 1st District shows that the boundaries drawn by the 
supervisors do not discriminate against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Fajardo said the decision by Antonovich and Dana to back Flores was an attempt 
by the two conservatives to maintain power by trying to persuade the court that 
her strong showing proved the county was not guilty of a Voting Rights Act 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
"The board looks on Flores as a way to derail the lawsuit," Fajardo said. "It's 
classic." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "If Sarah Flores wants to run, fine, but in a Hispanic district. . . . 
If these Republicans really believe the Hispanic community is Republican, or 
about to become Republican, they shouldn't be afraid to put her up in that 
district and test her ideas." 
</P>
<P>
For Fajardo, his work on the suit is part of a commitment to helping his 
community that began when he was a student at Garfield High School and was 
turned toward activism by the East Los Angeles school walkouts in 1968 to 
protest inadequate education. "I didn't participate," he said, "but it had a 
great impact on me." 
</P>
<P>
Fajardo's grandparents left Mexico for East Los Angeles in the 1920s. Like 
thousand of other Mexican families, they were fleeing from the turmoil that 
accompanied years of revolution in their country. 
</P>
<P>
His father was born in East Los Angeles. He worked for the post office and, 
later, as a food stamp program inspector for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad had a great impact on me," said Fajardo, 38. "He said I had to graduate 
from high school, and he encouraged me to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
First sign-ups for college-preparatory courses are in the eighth grade. But on 
sign-up day, the counselor handed Fajardo a program with classes such as wood 
shop, plastics and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it to my dad," Fajardo said. "He said, 'I thought you wanted to go to 
college.' I said, 'I did, but this is what they gave me.' He went down and 
talked to the counselor. The counselor said there was not enough room in the 
college-prep courses, and she wasn't sure I could compete in them." But his 
father insisted, and Fajardo was put on the college track. 
</P>
<P>
After he graduated from Garfield in 1969, Fajardo attended East Los Angeles 
College for a year and then, with the help of grants and loans, went to UC 
Santa Barbara. He got a master's degree in economics and got an internship in 
the Oxnard city treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into politics there," he said. "A friend and I were having trouble 
getting into the upper levels at the office," Fajardo said. "He ran for city 
treasurer and won." 
</P>
<P>
After helping with that campaign, Fajardo enrolled at UCLA Law School and, 
after graduation, clerked for a federal judge. In 1983 he joined the MALDEF 
legal staff in Washington, and three years later he was transferred to Los 
Angeles. Fajardo lives with his father in the house in which he was raised, 
near Ruben Salazar Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great honor to be asked (to join the staff) by MALDEF," Fajardo said. 
"I never thought I would get it. The big firms give you a lot of work, but you 
have to work into the big cases. At MALDEF, you have a tremendous amount of 
responsibility early on." 
</P>
<P>
Fajardo was the lead lawyer against the county in the redistricting suit. 
Colleague Mark Rosenbaum, attorney for the ACLU, said Fajardo brought to the 
case experience he had gained in pursuing a similar suit against the Los 
Angeles City Council. That suit was settled, with the council agreeing to 
create a new Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
That experience helped him in questioning Latino politicians and in working 
with UCLA professor Leobardo Estrada in drawing up the redistricting plan 
eventually accepted by Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum and others who watched the trial said Fajardo brought humanity to the 
often dusty issue of redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
His own feelings came out in closing arguments. Replying to the county's 
contention that discrimination was long past, Fajardo said discriminatory 
practices had left their mark on every Latino family here. He told how his 
uncle had returned from World War II as a decorated combat veteran. 
Celebrating, he and the family went to a movie and took a center seat. Latinos 
and blacks were consigned to the balcony and the sides of theaters in those 
days, and Fajardo's uncle was asked to move. 
</P>
<P>
Fajardo recalled for the court how his uncle said, " 'If I'm not good enough to 
sit where I want, I'll just leave.' It so moved several of the Hispanic and 
black patrons that they got up and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
"It showed," Fajardo said, "that it doesn't matter how much money you have, 
your position or whether you've risked your life in the war. You can still be 
subject to the indignity of an insult based on your race or ethnicity."

"I come from the barrio. I know what it's like," said Sister Guadalupe Zozaya 
of the more than 600 people who line up once a week for free fruit and 
vegetables at Mother of Sorrows Convent on West 87th Place in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask them no questions, make them fill out no forms," she said. "We treat 
them with respect." She has been distributing the food for two years "on 
Thursdays, my day off, with my brother Arthur, my right-hand man." Sister 
Guadalupe, who grew up in Boyle Heights, said the food program carries out the 
mission statement of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, her order: "Make the 
concerns of the poor your own."

SURPRISE SHAKE-UP AT KMEX PUTS NEW EXECUTIVE AT STATION'S HELM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID, Kleid is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a top-level shake-up, KMEX-TV Channel 34 General Manager Emilio Nicolas Jr. 
has resigned from his post just a little more than a year after he took over 
the Univision-owned station. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ramirez, KMEX general sales manager, was named Nicolas' successor by 
Univision and replaced him immediately. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview shortly after his departure last month, Nicolas 
disputed rumors circulating about his move. "The reason I'm leaving is that I'm 
tired, and I want to take a break. I've been thinking about it for some time," 
said the 36-year-old veteran of Spanish-language TV. "Nothing has 'happened' 
with me, as these rumors suggest. There is no mystery around it." 
</P>
<P>
The news of Nicolas' departure came as a surprise to many at the station and in 
the Southern California Latino community. It was unexpected that Nicolas, a 
popular general manager among his staff and a highly visible community leader, 
would be leaving his position so suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members at KMEX, which has the largest audience of any Univision 
affiliate, wondered aloud about the move. There was speculation that New 
York-based Univision executives did not like Nicolas' style of management. 
Inside sources said Nicolas clashed with financially strapped Univision over 
money-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the sources said, Univision pressured Nicolas to resign in 
reaction to financial losses from L.A. Fiesta Broadway, the pre-Cinco de Mayo 
bash in downtown Los Angeles that Nicolas orchestrated. 
</P>
<P>
In response to that allegation, Nicolas said Univision "was pleased" with 
Fiesta Broadway. "It was the first year of the fiesta. Yes, we did lose some 
money; there is no secret there. The point is, I didn't get canned for that," 
he said, emphasizing that leaving the Univision fold was his own decision. 
</P>
<P>
Estela Lopez, director of the organization Miracle on Broadway, who worked on 
the fiesta with Nicolas, said the fate of the festival is now being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Nicolas' departure, William Grimes, president of Univision 
Holdings Inc., said Nicolas had "helped guide KMEX through a critical period in 
Univision's history." 
</P>
<P>
Nicolas had devoted years of service to the network, working at stations in New 
York, San Antonio, San Francisco and finally Los Angeles. Nicolas expressed 
satisfaction at having been able to work in Los Angeles. "I'm glad I got to the 
biggest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Nicolas grew up around Spanish-language TV. His father, Emilio 
Nicolas, started the first Spanish-language station in this country and founded 
what has grown into the Univision network. The younger Nicolas said he 
eventually will get back into broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
One KMEX station insider, who declined to be identified, said Nicolas was a 
well-liked and accessible general manager. "He goes all out, and he treats 
people well. It seems to be a mystery to most of us here why he's leaving. But 
I know he was under a lot of pressure to keep things streamlined," the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Renteria, head of the Los Angeles-based National Hispanic Media 
Coalition, also expressed surprise that Nicolas was leaving. "I thought he was 
doing a pretty good job in the community," she said, adding that she did not 
know the new general manager, Ramirez, and could not comment on how he will 
affect the local media. 
</P>
<P>
When Nicolas took the reins at KMEX in April, 1989, he was immediately faced 
with a controversy. Members of his staff presented him with a petition 
encouraging him to name a person "who reflected the interests, experience and 
culture of Los Angeles" to the vacant position of news director. Although it 
was not explicitly stated, the petition suggested that Nicolas appoint someone 
of Mexican descent. Nicolas, who is Mexican-American, did fill the job with 
someone of Mexican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
One KMEX source expressed concern that Ramirez is of Cuban and Puerto Rican 
parentage and might not be attuned to the needs of the local Latino community, 
which is predominantly of Mexican origin. He said some people at KMEX are 
worried, alleging that Univision is being dominated by Cubans to the neglect of 
the Los Angeles Latino community. He contended that many of the important 
decisions at Univision are made in Miami and New York by people out of touch 
with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A KMEX spokeswoman said last month that Ramirez had no plans to change the 
management or the direction of the station. Ramirez had been in the KMEX sales 
division for the past six months. Before coming to Los Angeles, he was a 
general partner and general manager at English-language WHCT-TV in Hartford, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Manager Mike Martinez, who has worked at KMEX since 1987, was named as 
the new general sales manager.

<P>
On Aug. 30, Nuestro Tiempo published a list of "Exceptional Scholars" of 
Hispanic heritage from the Los Angeles and Orange counties. I was disappointed 
to find that Benjamin Franklin High School in Highland Park was completely 
omitted from this list. 
</P>
<P>
There are many 1990 graduates of Franklin High School who can be considered 
"Exceptional Scholars." To name a few, Beatriz Guerra will be attending Yale 
University in the fall. Federico Ramirez will be attending Stanford University. 
Carmen E. Ramon will be attending Occidental College. Marta Rivas and Vanessa 
Soto will be attending UC Berkeley. Giselle Arteaga will be attending Pomona 
College in the fall. These are only a few of the students who are "Exceptional 
Scholars."

SNOW, WINDS HIT UPPER MIDWEST; RECORD LOW TEMPERATURES IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blast of early autumn snow and gale-force winds swept into the upper Midwest 
on Wednesday, covering parts of Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin with up to six 
inches of powder and battering boats moored along Lake Michigan in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the mercury plunged below freezing in some Midwestern cities, 
with Duluth, Minn., reporting a record low for Oct. 10 of 21 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Texas also was chillier than usual for early October, with record morning lows 
in seven cities, including a 36-degree reading in San Angelo and 38 degrees in 
Wichita Falls and Midland. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service issued a gale warning along Lake Michigan as 
46-m.p.h. winds whipped up eight-foot waves that bashed boats against concrete 
moorings in Chicago's Monroe Harbor Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Park District officials said that 38 of the 1,200 boats at the club had 
been damaged by high winds since Sunday. Bob Nelson, director of harbors for 
the district, estimated the damage at an average of $5,000 a boat. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow in the Freeport, Ill., area downed power lines and snapped tree 
branches, police said. Roads in the area were described as slick and hazardous. 
Snow was reported in Peoria in central Illinois also. 
</P>
<P>
Central and south-central Wisconsin also received snow. The weather service 
reported that Friendship had six inches; Nekoosa, four inches; Wisconsin 
Rapids, three inches, and Antigo two inches. 
</P>
<P>
At least one person was killed in a snow-related traffic accident outside of 
Madison, Wis., police said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Marco formed in the Gulf of Mexico from a 
low-pressure system energized by the remains of Tropical Storm Klaus. 
</P>
<P>
The new storm, with 45-m.p.h. winds, was centered 70 miles northwest of Key 
West, Fla., but was expected to strengthen and move northwest, pouring as much 
as three inches of rain on parts of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
A tropical storm warning was posted over Florida Bay and the Florida Keys from 
the Dry Tortugas through Key Largo and over the west coast of Florida from 
Monroe County through Longboat Key.

It took six Brevard County jurors about an hour to convict him of beating his 
79-year-old grandmother, Elna Hlavaty, on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey could have been convicted of the more serious charge of aggravated 
battery on a person over 65. Conviction on that charge carries a penalty of at 
least three years in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
"Truth is, Ed Humphrey beat his grandmother. I had no qualms with the jury. It 
is difficult when they have a victim testifying for the defense," state 
attorney Norm Wolfinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey has been held on $1-million bond. No testimony was given about his 
status as a suspect in the serial slayings in August of five students in 
Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
Hlavaty, who testified for the defense, was upset by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"I am heartbroken that I have a crippled grandson that is being railroaded in 
hell until they find the Gainesville murderer," she said. Humphrey had been 
injured in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
After the alleged beating, Hlavaty called police and said her grandson had hit 
her. She later said she did not want to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors tried to show that Hlavaty was harmed intentionally and suffered 
bodily harm, permanent injury or permanent disfigurement. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged attack on Humphrey's grandmother occurred after the discovery 
earlier that week of the bodies of four female students and one male student in 
off-campus apartments. No one has been charged in those killings.

PEOPLE: WOMAN HELPS TO PRESERVE HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To preserve history, one must first save the paper it is written on, and Jane 
Mueller, a preservation librarian, is an expert in that lonely field. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand that there are things that can be done to preserve 
those important documents," said the Buena Park woman, who has mastered the 
fine art of paper preservation. 
</P>
<P>
With modern methods, paper can be preserved indefinitely, Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
She has shown others how it works in two free paper preservation workshops held 
at the Fullerton Library in August and earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
She may hold more. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears there is somewhat of a resurgence of history keeping, and people 
are holding it intact by preserving it whether the material is a family 
document, a news clipping or grandfather's scrapbook," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She demonstrated how to relax, de-acidify, clean and encapsulate paper and 
photographs by wrapping them with tape and polyester plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Older methods -- such as gluing keepsakes to newspapers that are bound with 
shoelaces -- are sometimes successful, Mueller said, although archaic. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of those papers were then stored in old chests," keeping out moisture 
and air, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the public to know that someone cares about their documents," said the 
one-time seamstress. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller attended Cypress College and Cal State Fullerton, earning a degree 
after 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was also raising children and had a house and husband to take care of," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Because few firms handle small jobs, most document preservation occurs at home, 
Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
While history has always been her interest, Mueller's work with the Santiago 
Library System Heritage Project "is really where it all started." 
</P>
<P>
She developed a computer database there of Southern California local history 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
But before that, "I liked working with my hands, and that included making 
paper," said the former fourth-grade substitute schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed teaching and remember saying to myself, 'Gosh, I don't know 
what they are paying me for.' " 
</P>
<P>
But she also enjoyed working with paper and finding a way to preserve history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was past 40 before I really got fully interested in history," said 
Mueller, 60. "I guess it takes time for people to acquire that interest." 
</P>
<P>
Tape-recorded oral histories are another way to permanently store historical 
keepsakes. "When you have a recording of a voice it provides you with a better 
sense of history and time by hearing the actual voice," Mueller said.

Photo, Driver sought -- The U.S. Customs Service released this photo of Ruben 
Sanchez Tapia, 38, the driver of the tanker truck seized at the U.S.-Mexico 
border last week with a record haul of almost four tons of cocaine. A federal 
warrant has been issued for Sanchez's arrest, saying he is wanted for illegally 
importing the cocaine with intent to distribute it. Sanchez, a Mexican citizen 
living in Tijuana, was a veteran driver for Hidro Gas Juarez, the Mexican firm 
that operated the propane truck, and was known to customs officials at Otay 
Mesa, a customs agent said.

HAZARDS OF RADIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is, of course, outrageous as you pointed out in your editorial "They Were 
Told There Was No Danger" (Oct. 1) that 500 uranium mine workers, an estimated 
150,000 civilians living downwind of atomic bomb tests that were conducted 
during the 1950s and 1960s and the military personnel who were used as guinea 
pigs during those same tests were lied to by the U.S. government regarding the 
hazards of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note, though, that we are still being lied to by our 
government and the nuclear industry regarding the safety of nuclear power 
plants and the effects of low-level radiation. 
</P>
<P>
In "Nuclear Witnesses -- Insiders Speak Out," author Leslie J. Freeman 
interviews medical researcher Dr. Rosalie Bertell, medical physicist Dr. John 
W. Gofman and physicist Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass regarding their many years of 
research on the health effects of low-level radiation. All three researchers 
have concluded that there are no "safe" levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the nuclear industry continues to promote the use of radiation in food 
irradiation and medicine, nuclear reactors continue to vent radiation into the 
water and air, and consumer products containing small amounts of radioactive 
materials continue to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most insidious and outrageous of all is the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission-approved plan to allow the nuclear industry to petition the NRC for 
permission to dispose of as much as one-third of its low-level radioactive 
waste as "below regulatory concern." This radioactive waste could then be 
disposed of as regular garbage and sent to landfills, incinerators and even 
recycling plants instead of to a properly regulated nuclear-waste disposal 
site.

<P>
Oil, at the present rate of consumption, runs out in about 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
The vast reserves of the world's oil are in the Middle East. Even if we 
developed every ounce of Alaskan and offshore oil that the United States 
possesses, we would have created only a few years worth of energy. How then, in 
the face of the Middle East crisis, can the President and Congress justify a 
budget that gives $4-billion tax credit to the oil industry for development and 
exploration, while simultaneously cutting from the budget solar and 
renewable-energy tax credits?

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING; 
</P>
<P>
FERRARO IS RIGHT TO OPPOSE FARMERS MARKET EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of its 56 years, the Los Angeles Farmers Market has not only been a 
neighborhood focal point, but also a good neighbor to the Angelenos who live 
around it. However it may change in the years ahead -- and some change is 
inevitable -- it must remain both of those things. 
</P>
<P>
That is why City Council President John Ferraro was right Tuesday when he 
joined Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in opposing plans to replace the existing 
market with a 2-million-square-foot, mixed-use development. Ferraro, whose 
district includes Farmers Market, called for the A.F. Gilmore Co. to 
drastically downsize its proposal to build a massive development that would 
include three department stores, a hotel, offices and housing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project is a mismatch in terms of scale and design to its 
surrounding residential neighborhoods in the Fairfax area. Ferraro advocated 
instead a 700,000-square- foot shopping center, which is more appropriate and a 
less intrusive use of the 31-acre site at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue. But he 
conceded that even a reduced development would alter the area. 
</P>
<P>
No one is denying change for the Farmers Market, which draws neighborhood 
shoppers as well as tourists from around the world. Originally the site of 16 
stalls offering fruits and vegetables, the market is now home to more than 130 
food stands, souvenir shops and other enterprises. Many merchants maintain 
change is needed to attract more visitors and business to the market. 
</P>
<P>
But a mammoth development would add only more congestion to an area already 
choked with heavy traffic. Neighborhood groups also have expressed a preference 
for a smaller development similar to proposals made by a mayoral task force. 
There also are environmental concerns because of methane deposits in the area. 
The market is located across the street from a store where 24 people were 
injured in a methane blast and fire in 1985. As for the need for more stores, 
the City Planning Department, which has recommended against any proposal for 
the site, points out that there are four regional shopping areas within five 
miles of the Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's decision was anxiously awaited because of his long silence during the 
discussions on the project, which began in the early 1980s. As head of City 
Council, he has clout and his opinion resonates far beyond his district. 
Yaroslavsky, who represents a nearby district, has called the project proposal 
"absurd" and commended his colleague's decision, describing it as a "step in 
the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
So it's back to the drawing board for the Gilmore Co. Being a good neighbor is 
not always easy, but the prospect of overdevelopment is downright unneighborly 
and no improvement for anyone.

Chancellor Joseph Fernandez of the New York City schools recently recommended 
distribution of condoms in his schools to help promote "safe sex." Your Sept. 
30 editorial congratulated the chancellor for his leadership in this regard, 
and for keeping his personal religious convictions (Catholic) separate from his 
secular responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
But there should be no difference between the religious and the secular. His 
moral and religious convictions should be intertwined with all his 
responsibilities. Isn't he supposed to tell the truth in church, as well as in 
school? 
</P>
<P>
What we in Los Angeles, and they in New York, need most are more public leaders 
who do not separate their personal, moral, religious beliefs from the rest of 
life, but bring those truths, values and convictions to bear on every problem 
society faces.

It is no wonder that our children have no moral direction in their lives. Not

PERSPECTIVE ON TERM LIMITATIONS;

<P>
TELL SACRAMENTO THAT'S THE LIMIT;

WITH NEW BLOOD IN THE LEGISLATURE, CALIFORNIANS COULD RESTORE THE STATE'S 
GOOD-GOVERNMENT REPUTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

as a Los Angeles County supervisor.

<TEXT>
<P>
This November voters will have the opportunity to limit the terms of their 
state officials and to cut the costs of the state Legislature. They can do this 
by voting for Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, according to the California Journal, "state legislatures around the 
country are starting to echo a common theme: Don't become like California's 
Legislature." It is a dramatic reversal from 1970 when California's Legislature 
was rated the nation's best by the National Council of Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature draws equally bleak reviews from its own public. A Los Angeles 
Times poll shows that Californians believe that "most legislators are for sale 
to fat-cat campaign contributors." 
</P>
<P>
What explains the Legislature's decline in national esteem and in Californians' 
opinion? Its leaders have decades of service; veteran legislators abound in 
both chambers; it is the most lavishly funded of any Legislature in the nation; 
it is the most comprehensively staffed (more than 3,000 aides serve 120 
legislators) and its retirees have the most generous pensions. 
</P>
<P>
If such standards could guarantee success, California's Legislature would still 
be No. 1. In fact, these are the very features that disable it in its most 
important role, as a representative body. 
</P>
<P>
Their long years in Sacramento are precisely the reason why so many of our 
legislators are out of step with today's California. Sheltered from electoral 
tides in safe districts, incumbent California legislators have lost only nine 
times in 580 races since 1982. Immunized against political change, with only a 
trickle of new members from election to election, the legislative caucuses 
produce a kind of petrified politics in which the policy conflicts of the 1970s 
and early 1980s are continuously replayed. 
</P>
<P>
Extremism in the caucuses is encouraged by gerrymandering. Stacked with 
registrants of one party, ultrasafe districts encourage partisan stalemates and 
ideological grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators' huge office budgets and ever-growing staffs afford further 
insulation from the people. Staff members perform many duties in place of the 
representatives themselves, from answering constituency mail to drafting their 
bills. Staff do the detailed research on policy needs. 
</P>
<P>
Safe districts and bloated staffs undergird today's privileged Capitol 
lifestyle. Cash and other rewards multiply its attractions. Some legislators 
(Willie Brown is only the most flamboyant example) build fortunes in the course 
of their Sacramento careers. Legislators vote themselves generous allowances, 
lease luxury automobiles, fly first-class and use the sergeants-at-arms to run 
personal errands, even for household chores. 
</P>
<P>
Every incumbent is the beneficiary of a pension program that can yield $5,000, 
even $10,000 per month. For many legislators, it is by far the best job they 
can ever hope to have. No wonder they want to remain in office. And no wonder 
their staffers jostle hungrily to fill the infrequent vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-quarter of all Assembly members are former staffers. 
Increasingly, the Capitol attracts individuals looking for the rewards of 
lifelong careers there. Often, such people have no other experience in life 
than political involvement, no other job credentials. For them, defeat in an 
election would be a matter of despair. No wonder that their preoccupation is 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
It is a preoccupation that drives many legislators, however safe their 
districts, to bob and weave around every controversial issue. To stay out of 
trouble, they avoid controversial policy stands. Developing cozy relationships 
with senior bureaucrats and lobbyists, they resist change and become defenders 
of an increasingly indefensible status quo. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of budget snarls, freeway gridlock, drug epidemics and 
environmental threats, their great ambition is to maneuver out of harm's way. 
The result of such legislative incapacity and stagnation is that more and more 
of the state's business must be transacted through initiative measures. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to remain in office leads, also, to the obsessive stockpiling of 
campaign funds dunned from interest groups. This is the reason why a 
Legislature with nearly 100% reelection rates remains awash in millions of 
dollars of "campaign contributions." It is why legislators spend less time with 
constituents than with lobbyists (who fork out almost $100 million a year in 
Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140 offers three remedies: 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the terms of incumbents. California urgently needs better -- more 
representative and more responsive -- legislators. The only way to end 
Sacramento's special-interest policies and their attendant abuses is to limit 
terms. Legislators with limited terms can take strong stands and resist special 
interests. They have no need of gerrymandered districts or campaign slush 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
* Cut the Legislature's operating budget. This is the way to limit staff power 
-- and to increase the involvement and thereby the understanding of 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
* Put an end to the state's extravagant pension plan. This is how we can rid 
Sacramento of its ingrown class of careerists. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140's three reforms will produce a Legislature that is more 
representative of the opinions and more responsive to the needs of a 
dramatically changing California. Opportunities for public service will be 
available to many new people -- women, minorities and many others -- bringing 
in fresh ideas and acting courageously in the interests of California's future. 
</P>
<P>
Can we really believe that our current 120 legislators and their 3,000 aides 
are the only capable and experienced people among nearly 20 million adult 
citizens? It's time for change in the closed society of our Capitol.

Amid the rubble of the failed budget deal, Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell declared Monday, "We reap the bitter harvest of 10 years of national 
self-indulgence." Other accomplices in the package rejected by the House of 
Representatives redoubled their calls for "necessary sacrifice" by the American 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The people said hooey, and the people were right. The failed package required 
only selective sacrifice, from which the rich were exempted. There's been no 
national self-indulgence over the last 10 years, only the indulgence of a class 
that launched a smash-and-grab raid on the Treasury more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
As the Democratic leaders capitulated in the final days of the secret budget 
negotiations, the package tilted in a savagely regressive direction: not just 
the hike in Medicare premiums and deductibility and in consumption taxes, but 
-- at the onset of a recession! -- such cruelties as requiring that laid-off 
workers wait two weeks before collecting unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's on-again, off-again agonies Tuesday about whether to raise the 
top marginal tax rate to 32% (it was more than 75% in the days of Comrade 
Nixon) in exchange for a capital gains tax cut only underscore Bush's 
sympathies for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
The majestic contours of the smash-and-grab have been swelling since the 1970s 
(no need to blame it all on Reagan, Bush and the Republicans). Since then, the 
income of the richest one-fifth of the population has risen by 33.2%, of the 
top 1% by 95.1%. The income of the bottom 60% fell. Between 1979 and 1989, 
capital income (from rents, dividends and interest) rose by 66.2%. Real hourly 
wages fell by more than 9%. Pensions, health insurance and paid time off 
dropped by 13.8%.

One more set of figures from Lawrence Mishel and David Frankel's "State of 
Working America," recently published by the Economic Policy Institute: The 
average American CEO earned a pretax $308,200 in 1979 and a pretax $612,800 in 
1989. The post-tax figure for 1979 was $153,900 and in 1989, $429,100. 
</P>
<P>
Such, in statistical form, is the political culture that shaped the budget 
package finally rejected by legislators cowering under the abuse of their 
constituents. Such are the ingredients of the popular fury that handed the 
neo-Nazi David Duke his surprisingly large though losing vote in Louisiana and, 
more significantly, gave the more respectably racist John Silber his stunning 
victory in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Angry people will strike out with such weapons as are available to them, and 
effective weapons are hard to come by in a country run under one-party rule in 
the interests of the rich and the corporate. One weapon, tested already in 
Oklahoma and scheduled for a vote in California on the November ballot, is term 
limits for elected officials and politicians. Throw the rascals out. It's 
pretty clear that Pete Schabarum's Proposition 140, with its shotgun six-year 
legislative limit, would land the state even more deeply in the arms of the 
lobbyists and corporate interests in which it already reposes. Proposition 131, 
the liberal alternative, has more appeal. Limited merely to 12 consecutive 
years in office, state legislators wouldn't, as with Proposition 140, just be a 
bunch of chickens led around by seasoned lobbyist foxes. With $3 in public 
matching money for each $1 in small donations raised within the district, it 
would give the little guy a bit more clout. 
</P>
<P>
So Proposition 131 could be a powerful, constructive weapon for angry people. 
But what would all those prospective new legislators, some of them presumably 
burning with zeal to reform a corrupted system, actually do? It's the same 
question one can ask about the admirable Proposition 128, "Big Green." Suppose 
it wins? Then where is the mass movement to ensure that its provisions don't 
get beached in protracted court fights; to sustain its challenge to present 
economic assumptions about what costs and benefits should be? 
</P>
<P>
You can't make any substantive political change without a political movement 
and, in the end, without a political party. In Canada there is that third-party 
alternative to the Liberals and Conservatives -- the social-democratic New 
Democratic Party. Last month, angry voters in Ontario, Canada's industrial 
heartland, kicked out the ruling Liberals and handed power to the self-declared 
socialist Bob Rae. 
</P>
<P>
There's no New Democratic Party here, but if people are not to turn in 
desperation to the hate-mongers like Silber or Duke, the 1990s will have to see 
the forging of populist, radical grass-roots coalitions. Without such 
collective purpose and sanction, the consequences of term limits will be 
nothing but bipartisan business as usual, as symbolized by the budget package 
in Washington or Monday's pillow fight between Dianne Feinstein and Pete 
Wilson.

BUSH DIDN'T LEARN FROM THE MASTER: REAGAN; 
</P>

IN COMBAT, AS IN POLITICS, THE TROOPS MUST HAVE A COMMANDER WILLING TO FIGHT.

What good is it having a Republican President when he caves in to demands by 
Democrats and allows them to write a new budget in committees controlled by 
their party? We can count on the "Bush budget" resembling a Michael Dukakis 
budget, with the twin monsters of higher taxes and higher spending imposed on a 
population tired of both. 
</P>
<P>
As he watches his popularity decline, (a Times Mirror poll showed it dropping 
from a high of 76% in August to 55% this week), Bush might consider a lesson 
from Abraham Lincoln: "If once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow 
citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem." Addressing the nation 
on television last week, Bush said: "This is the first time in my presidency 
that I have made an appeal like this to you, the American people. Tell your 
congressmen and senators you support this (budget) agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The calls came in, but they were calls of protest, and this is where Bush's 
strategy, so different from Ronald Reagan's, proved flawed. The 
pro-abortionists who were to be attracted into the new Republican "big tent" 
didn't rush to help the President. 
</P>
<P>
Reaganite conservatives who had supported Bush because he talked tough on 
crime, gun control, reduced government and other issues dear to their hearts 
did not respond either, except in derision. Conservative fund-raiser Richard 
Viguerie, who is persona non grata at the Bush White House, denounced the 
now-defunct budget agreement in a letter to GOP maverick Rep. Newt Gingrich of 
Georgia: "The conservative movement is the adversary of anyone, in Congress or 
the White House, who would skewer the American people with higher taxes. We 
will not affiliate ourselves with tax collectors for the welfare state." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Armstrong (R-Colo.) told me that "by trying to avoid 
confrontation, President Bush undermined his own leadership potential. 
Confrontation is what Ronald Reagan did effectively. Reagan didn't avoid 
confrontation, he sought it." 
</P>
<P>
In combat, as in politics, the troops must have a commander willing to fight. 
But time and time again, the President seemed to take tough stands, only to 
negotiate away a winning position when he faced strong opposition. Instead of 
blaming Congress for the impasse and calling on the people to help him, as 
Reagan did, Bush backpedals and invites his ideological enemies in for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Many conservatives believe Bush abandoned a core set of principles necessary to 
win their support. Public disapproval of Congress is so high that a popular 
President ought to be able to make political chopped liver out of its members. 
Properly conducted, an anti-Congress campaign by the President could benefit 
Republican conservatives and perhaps win back a majority in one or both houses. 
Failure to launch such a campaign means that Bush will be set upon by the 
anti-government angel of death about to swoop down on all of Washington.

Argonaut Group Inc.: The Los Angeles-based holding company said its 
third-quarter net income slipped to $21.7 million from $22.7 million in the 
1989 period. Revenue rose 15% to $172.3 million. The firm, which sells, 
underwrites and services workers' compensation and property-casualty insurance, 
said the current year's revenue gains resulted primarily from the sale of 
investments in Earle M. Jorgensen Co. in response to a tender offer.

Mideast Respite: The tall woman and her security guards turned heads Monday at

Denial: Both Ronald Reagan and his longtime friend and political ally, former 
Sen. Paul Laxalt, are denying a report in Sidney Blumenthal's "Pledging 
Allegiance" that Laxalt was strongly opposed to the selection of George Bush 
for vice president in 1980. In a letter to the Washington Post Tuesday, Laxalt 
said: "I felt (Bush's) selection was a wise one and so indicated to Mr. Reagan 
at the time." Reagan Tuesday accused Blumenthal of "untruths." Blumenthal said 
Tuesday that he stands by his report.

Kesey and Lorenzo West, both of whom died six years ago in a traffic accident. 
Kesey's daughter, Sunshine, had asked him where they might go to meet Jed if 
"somehow we were to die." Kesey, who wrote "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 
said: "Jed would know to meet me up here on Mount Pisgah."

It took "Glory" two weeks to do what no other movie could do in the last two 
months -- drive "Driving Miss Daisy" out of the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 
magazine rental chart. "Miss Daisy" slid into second gear, finally slipping to 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory," a Civil War drama featuring the performance that won Denzel Washington 
a best supporting actor Oscar, ascended to No. 1 largely because the Civil War 
is all the rage these days thanks to that lauded PBS TV series. It looks like 
"Born on the Fourth of July," which dropped a notch to No. 3, won't reach the 
top of the Billboard chart after all. Debuts: "The Fire Birds" (No. 22), with 
Nicolas Cage and Tommy Lee Jones, and the seamy, unrated "Henry: Portrait of a 
Serial Killer" (No. 30). 
</P>
<P>
* Disney's "Peter Pan" jumped from No. 17 to No. 8 in its second week on the 
chart. More significant, though, is that it shot to No. 1 on the sales chart, 
which measures sales to video retailers and distributors. At $24.99 it could be 
the biggest seller in the home-video market this holiday season.

Ninja Turtles in Court: The director and a co-producer of "Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles" filed a $5-million suit alleging they haven't been paid their fair 
share of profits from the hit film. Director Steve Barron and producer Simon 
Fields claim they were guaranteed 10% of net profits plus salary in an 
agreement they signed with distributor Golden Harvest Films Inc. in January, 
1989. The Superior Court suit filed Tuesday alleges that Barron and Simon were 
fired from the film crew without explanation in November. CLAUDIA PUIG

La Espanola Deli, 2020 Lomita Blvd. No. 7, Lomita, (213) 539-0455. Hours: 
Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-5 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a housewife, I was a customer here," says Juana Faraone, proprietor 
of La Espanola Deli in Lomita. "When the owners wanted to sell, I thought it 
would be the perfect business for me because I love to cook." 
</P>
<P>
La Espanola Deli is the only Los Angeles-area store that deals exclusively in 
Spanish products. Every weekend, transplanted Spaniards crowd into the 
minuscule shop in an obscure area of Lomita to pick up some manchego cheese, or 
a chunk of serrano ham and some Spanish paprika for their Fabada Asturiana. 
They come in for the northern style chorizos de Bilbao that dangle on racks 
behind the shop's compact deli case or for the tiny links of russet 
cantimpalito sausages of Central Spain. In addition to those Spanish sausages, 
La Espanola carries about a dozen more varieties. 
</P>
<P>
All the sausages are made on the premises, in a USDA-inspected sausage-making 
kitchen that is also the only one of its kind in the area. La Espanola produces 
Spanish-style hams and sausages, some of which remain up to 18 months in the 
plant's curing room. 
</P>
<P>
The company can turn out about 1,000 pounds of sausage a day, which it 
distributes to restaurants and stores across the country. That is quite a jump 
from what the company was producing when Faraone purchased it from an old 
Spanish couple eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Faraone trained at La Espanola for a month before the owners turned their 
formulations over to her. But the first batches of sausage she made on her own 
were a disaster. "My Sobresada, which should always be a beautiful, deep red, 
developed white spots and I couldn't figure out why," she remembers. Faraone 
consulted a family friend, Father Miguel, a priest from Majorca who had been in 
charge of hog butchering and traditional sausage making at a Nevada monastery. 
Together they prepared La Espanola's first successful batch of Sobresada 
Mallorquena. 
</P>
<P>
Father Miguel counseled Faraone on a few fine points of sausage-making: the 
correct temperature for the meat before it is ground, how to watch for 
rancidity in sausages as they cure. Faraone then traveled throughout Spain to 
observe sausage-making techniques firsthand. Back in the United States she 
attended professional seminars and eventually obtained her USDA status. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish food has vivid, earthy flavors and Mediterranean accents that seem 
natural for California. But it has only recently been finding a following here. 
You can prepare Spanish food without the authentic ingredients you find at La 
Espanola, of course, but your cazuelas, egg tortillas and Iberian bean dishes 
will be missing that essentially "Spanish" taste. And unless paella is prepared 
with the sort of short-grained Valencia rice sold in La Espanola's deli, it 
won't have the chewy texture that reminds you you're eating the genuine item. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING LIST: 
</P>
<P>
* Serrano Ham: Many compare Serrano ham to Italian prosciutto but its flavor is 
sweeter and nuttier and, as a rule, it is sliced thicker than prosciutto. In 
Spain some of the best hams, including Jamones Ibericos and Jamones de Jabugo, 
come from pigs fed on acorns. At the moment no one imports them and La Espanola 
cannot obtain acorn-fed pork. But their hams, made with lean, domestic pork and 
cured 18 months are very good. 
</P>
<P>
The deli carries the ham sliced in 4-ounce packages, but it is preferable to 
slice your own from the whole hams. 
</P>
<P>
For tapas, cubes of the ham are customarily speared on a wooden pick or 
hand-cut for pan con tomate y jamon (known in northeastern Spain, where it is a 
focus of local patriotism, as pa amb tomaquet): crisp bread rubbed with tomato, 
drizzled with olive oil and topped with the ham. In the Basque country the ham 
is an essential part of piperade, a dish composed of fresh-roasted sweet green 
peppers, onions and tomatoes cooked slowly together until they are meltingly 
sweet then swirled with beaten eggs to make a Basque-style tortilla. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano ham hocks, which La Espanola also sells, add their robust flavor to 
Cocido Madrileno, a sort of pot-au-feu dinner served in courses or lentil and 
bean dishes. Faraone uses the hocks in her spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
* Manchego cheese: Once the cheese of sheep herders in the region of La Mancha 
on the Castilian plateau, Manchego's sharp, complex, buttery flavor is due in 
part to the Manchego sheep's milk from which it is produced. Manchego will 
always carry a denominacion de origen label, assuring that only cheese made in 
the region may bear that name. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest cheeses are cured 60 days; La Espanola sells the three-month aged 
cheese that is still semi-soft and considered young enough for eating. Manchego 
is typically offered with fresh fruit or the quince paste membrillo and a 
chilled fine Sherry. Older Manchego makes an excellent grating and cooking 
cheese and is made by simply keeping the wheels of cheese in a cool dark place, 
or even in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
* Pimenton: Sometimes called Spanish paprika, this is not the same as Hungarian 
paprika although it does come from a related sweet pepper. Pimenton is 
indispensable for most Spanish cooking. 
</P>
<P>
* Spanish saffron: La Espanola stocks one-gram vials of true Spanish saffron. 
Its threads are the deep red variety with only a little yellow -- an indication 
of a good quality. Toast the saffron threads in a dry skillet very briefly just 
before you use it. 
</P>
<P>
* Lomo embuchado: Faraone calls this cured pork loin "the Cadillac of the 
house." Fresh eye of loin meticulously trimmed of fat is hand-rubbed with a 
mixture of white wine and spices. The meat marinates in a cooler for about 
eight days, which draws off some of the moisture and allows the seasonings to 
penetrate. After being packed in a natural casing it hangs in the curing room 
at 63 degrees for three to nine months, depending on the size of the loin. The 
lomo is somewhat like a ham but not as salty and is best eaten as simply as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
La Espanola produces fully cured sausages (similar to salami) as well as 
semi-cured and uncured or "fresh" sausages. 
</P>
<P>
SEMI-CURED SAUSAGES are dried only a few days, and must be lightly cooked. The 
light curing intensifies their flavor but the sausages remain juicy enough to 
impart a meaty, well-seasoned taste to beans, lentils or rice casseroles. Even 
with lengthy simmering, semi-cured sausages won't dry out. 
</P>
<P>
* Chistorra: The Basque region, known for some of Spain's finest cooking, not 
surprisingly produces the country's most flavorful sausages. Chistorra, long 
skinny pork links that mingle a deep smokiness with plenty of garlic, really 
pack a flavor punch. Basques eat these for breakfast with eggs or simply with 
sturdy country bread. Like all the semi-cured sausages, Chistorra makes an 
excellent flavoring for cooked dishes. 
</P>
<P>
* Chorizo de Bilbao: One of Spain's most popular cooking chorizos, this is 
another sausage originally from the Basque provinces and around Pamplona. Its 
pungent, slightly firm meat is seasoned with the usual Spanish trinity of 
garlic, pimenton and pepper, but it's also laced with cumin and oregano. 
Similar to but more robust than uncured chorizo fresco, Bilbao stores well in 
the refrigerator and keeps for longer periods than the fresh sausages. 
</P>
<P>
* Cantimpalito: Stuffed into small sheep casings and tied at 1-inch intervals, 
all-pork Cantimpalitos are the size of a single finger digit. They are 
garlicky, rosy with pimenton, and have a light, smoky flavor. In bean or rice 
dishes or sauteed with vegetables, Cantimpalitos make plump, bite-sized meaty 
nuggets. Be sure to pierce each Cantimpalito a few times with the tines of a 
fork before heating it through. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRESH SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
* Chorizo fresco: Like chorizo de Bilbao, this is eaten throughout Spain and 
makes a wonderful cooking sausage. Because it isn't cured, chorizo fresco 
exudes more of its fat -- which isn't actually very much. (La Espanola makes 
both its Bilbao and chorizo fresco with less than 20% fat.) What fat there is 
becomes the perfect medium for sauteing onions, garlic and tomato to make one 
style of sofrito, the all-purpose flavoring base used for hundreds of Spanish 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
* Butifarritas: Chubby, white and mildly flavored, these Catalonian-style 
sausages, from around Barcelona, are the leanest of La Espanola's line. They 
are reminiscent of Weisswurst but with a firmer texture. As is true of many 
Catalan sausages, the familiar pimenton in the seasoning is absent. Instead, 
Butifarrita's delicate flavor comes from a mixture of white pepper, garlic and 
nutmeg. Catalonians love them in bean dishes, turned over charcoal or cooked 
with turnips or cabbage. These sausages are cooked at the factory and need only 
be heated through. 
</P>
<P>
* Butifarra Catalana: This is simply a larger version of Butifarrita that is 
often sliced and sauteed to serve with white beans or used in sandwiches. The 
wide sausages are stuffed in collagen casing rather than the natural casing 
that encloses Butifarritas. It should be peeled away. 
</P>
<P>
* Longaniza: These large, light-colored sausages with just a touch of pimenton 
seem a close relative of Italian sausage; their flavor, however, is quite 
different. Longanizas make good cooking sausages but more often they appear as 
an entree with vegetables and potatoes as an accompaniment. Of course, they 
make wonderful tapas and fillings for omelets. 
</P>
<P>
* Morcilla: La Espanola prepares two Spanish blood sausages. Their morcilla con 
arroz (with rice) is seasoned in the manner of blood sausages from the Levente 
region around Valencia, with garlic and cinnamon. Morcilla con cebolla (with 
onions), a style favored in the North around Oviedo in Asturias, has a light 
sprinkling of cloves and cayenne. Both sausages contain about 60% lean pork -- 
more meat than the morcillas served on Argentine restaurant parilladas -- those 
are more like a soft blood pudding. Since the morcillas are precooked they need 
only be warmed and sliced and accompanied by bread for tapas or lightly grilled 
and served alongside other grilled meats with a good bottle of Rioja wine. 
</P>
<P>
* Mexican-style chorizos: These are similar to Spanish chorizos frescos but 
less lean and much spicier with cayenne and oregano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURED SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
In general the cured sausages are eaten as a cold cut and only occasionally 
used in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
* Soria or Spanish Girl sausage: This variety originated in Old Castile around 
Soria and Logrono. Although actually a sausage, it resembles a gently seasoned 
lean pork loin with a concentrated meaty taste. The meat is diced by hand, 
seasoned and cured overnight to reduce its moisture. The mixture is then 
tightly packed into a natural, Portuguese net-like casings and air-dried for 
three months. Simply eat it sliced and in sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
* Pamplona style: The snap of garlic mellowed by a hint of pimenton makes this 
a good eating sausage. It is similar to salami. To get the right texture, the 
pork for these sausages is ground twice with a 24-hour rest period between 
grindings. "The meat should look like small grains of rice," says Faraone. A 
Pamplona-style sausage is cured three to six months, depending on its 
dimension. 
</P>
<P>
* Cantimpalo: Like the Pamplona style, Cantimpalo is similar to a salami but is 
the thickness of a broom handle. The sausage is more highly seasoned with 
cayenne and cumin, and the beef and pork for its filling are ground separately 
-- each to a different coarseness -- giving the sausage its characteristic 
double texture. Cantimpalo originated in the regions that include Salamanca, 
Segovia and Valladolid. Some cooks there like to include it in cooked dishes 
but it must only be heated through to prevent drying out. 
</P>
<P>
* Sobrasada: Sobrasada's deep-wine color comes from the large quantities of 
pimenton and cayenne used to flavor it. When it is whole, this Majorcan sausage 
resembles a salami, but its texture is soft and almost spreadable. Spaniards 
liken Sobrasada to a pate, though I find it a bit firmer, and recommend putting 
slices of it on crackers or bread and warming it under the broiler. Sobrasada's 
strong, earthy flavor goes a long way to enhance vegetables: Faraone recommends 
cabbage and cauliflower. Her advice: "The sausage should be cut up and only 
barely warmed to melting before adding the vegetables. Cook the cauliflower, 
with a lid on the pan, removing it to stir the vegetable periodically until it 
is tender." Many cooks like to add small bits of Sobrasada to their tortilla 
Espanola, Spain's famous potato omelet eaten at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
* Fuet: The name means "whip" in the Catalan language, and as you'd expect, it 
is long and skinny. This very garlicky dry-cured all-pork sausage originated in 
the Catalonian region and contains no pimenton but is lightly flavored with 
pepper and nutmeg. Fuet is loved as a snacking sausage or sliced thinly and 
sprinkled on salads. 
</P>
<P>
* Salchichon del Vich: Similar to Italian Genoa salami, this is another cured 
sausage made without pimenton. Salchichon is deliciously rich, fatty and 
freckled with crunchy bits of black pepper and garlic, dusted with cinnamon and 
nutmeg. It is a favorite in Madrid for tapas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ADDITIONAL IMPORTED SPANISH FOODS 
</P>
<P>
* Bacalao sin espinas: "It might seem strange," writes author Colman Andrews in 
"Catalan Cuisine," "that a preserved fish should have become so popular in a 
land where fish of the fresh sort is so obviously plentiful." Bacalao, like ham 
and bacon, remained a favorite food long after practical keeping qualities were 
its main attraction. When properly desalinated and sauced, bacalao produces 
some of the world's best dishes. 
</P>
<P>
La Espanola carries quality boneless salt cod -- some can be as dry and 
board-like as an old packing crate. Theirs is slightly moist, pliable and cut 
from the thick center of the fish. It is creamy white rather than dusty gray. 
Salt cod must be soaked at least two days in fresh water with a change of water 
several times a day. Longer soakings up to four days are even better. 
</P>
<P>
* Valencia rice: Round-grained and slightly sticky, Valencia rice is grown in 
the farm regions of Cullera and Sueca. Rice, first introduced to Valencia by 
the Moors, is basic to its Middle Eastern-influenced cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Just as you need Arborio rice to make a successful risotto, so a good paella 
requires Valencia rice. Apart from paella, the region's hundreds of other rice 
dishes are traditionally cooked in an earthenware cazuela, glazed only on the 
inside. Just about anything can go into a rice cazuela, from Valencia orange 
juice with almonds and raisins to an assortment of cockles and periwinkles. 
</P>
<P>
* Spanish olive oil: As the world's leading producer of olive oil, Spain 
markets many fine-quality extra virgin olive oils. Of these, Ybarra and 
Carbonell are two of Spain's esteemed dealers. La Espanola carries both brands 
along with several others. 
</P>
<P>
* Turron: Another specialty with Moorish roots, Turron is a chewy, crunchy 
nougat of honey and egg whites barely holding together whole roasted almonds. 
At Christmastime, stores and shops throughout Spain are filled with many 
varieties of turron. (The people of the Lavante region, who claim it as their 
own, say they are good any time of year except after a visit to the dentist.) 
The same dessert comes in a round form sandwiched between paper-thin waffle 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
* Marzipan figurines: These animal-shaped almond-paste figurines look like 
three dimensional cookies in that they have been oven-toasted. According to 
Faraone, the 1890 brand sold in the deli is the best known and, some say, the 
finest in Spain. 
</P>

THE BUTCHER: HE HAILS C.A.B.S

<P>
I'm a C.A.B. man. This has nothing to do with my preferred method of 
transportation. It has to do with my preference for Angus beef over the meat of 
most any other breed. 
</P>
<P>
C.A.B. stands for Certified Angus Beef, a program that guarantees -- better 
than any other beef-grading program today, including that of the U.S.D.A. -- a 
consistently high quality of beef. The program, which was established primarily 
for the restaurant trade, came into existence in 1978, two years after the 
U.S.D.A. lowered its standards for Choice beef. Restaurants need top-quality 
beef; many of them build their reputations on it. The C.A.B. program helps 
assure them of a consistent supply of good beef. 
</P>
<P>
Today about half of the beef that comes to market is graded by the U.S.D.A., 
and about 90% of this is graded Choice. But of that number, more than 70% falls 
into the lowest acceptable marbling range for the grade. In contrast, Certified 
Angus Beef accepts only the highest two marbling levels (the upper 30%) of the 
U.S.D.A. Choice grade, from carcasses of Angus-type cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the folks at C.A.B. decided to put together a book, "The Art of 
Cooking With Certified Angus Beef," containing recipes prepared by 36 
world-class chefs who rely on C.A.B. in their restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite recipe from this fabulous collection is Cowboy Steak with Red Chili 
Onion Rings, the creation of Mark Miller of the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe. I have 
followed him from the Fourth Street Grill in Berkeley, to the Santa Fe Bar and 
Grill in Berkeley to Santa Fe, New Mexico where I think he's found a home. 
</P>
<P>
If you like this dish as much as I did, you will enjoy "Coyote Cafe: Foods From 
the Southwest," a new book by Miller. To obtain a copy of "The Art of Cooking 
with Certified Angus Beef, call (419) 853-4066 or send $19.95 to: Certified 
Angus Beef, P.O. Box 819, West Salem, Ohio 44287.

COOK IT LIGHT: HASH: IT'S NOT JUST FOR BREAKFAST ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
This potato recipe is a sure-fire winner for any meal. For breakfast or brunch, 
serve it with slices of fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
For lunch or dinner I prefer to serve it with a medley of colorful vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
The hash will taste best if you make it the day before you plan to serve it. It 
is a wonderful way to use leftover roast beef. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST BEEF HASH 
</P>
<P>
2 large potatoes (1 pound), grated, soaked and well- drained (3 cups) 
</P>
<P>
2 cups finely chopped cooked roast beef, all visible fat removed 
</P>
<P>
2 cups finely chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 cups defatted beef stock 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt (omit if using salted stock) 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
Combine potatoes, roast beef and onions in shallow baking dish. Mix well. Place 
under broiler until browned, stirring frequently to brown deeply and evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer mixture to heavy, oven-proof skillet. Add garlic, beef stock, salt, 
pepper and Worcestershire. Mix well. Simmer over medium heat until potatoes are 
tender and all liquid is absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
Pat surface down with back of large spoon. Again place under broiler to brown 
and crisp top. Serve immediately. Makes 4 cups or 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If made day before serving, cool to room temperature after simmering hash 
and before crisping final time. Return to baking dish, pat surface down with 
back of large spoon, cover tightly and refrigerate. To serve hash, heat at 350 
degrees about 15 minutes to heat thoroughly. Place under broiler to brown and 
crisp prior to serving. 
</P>
<P>
Each serving contains approximately 289 calories; 91 mg cholesterol; 8 gm fat; 
480 mg sodium.

BACK TO BASICS: SQUID -- IT ONLY TAKES TWO HANDS TO FIX 'EM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For those unfamiliar with squid, the first experience of tackling the cleaning 
of these mollusks with eight legs and two tentacles protruding from the head 
can be intimidating. Actually it's a very simple task. 
</P>
<P>
Thaw the squid if frozen. Rinse well under cold running water and drain on 
paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Gently pull apart the head and mantle, or body tube (Step 1). Set the mantle 
section aside. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the tentacles off just in front of the eyes (Step 2) so they remain in a 
ring. Discard the eyes and attached material. 
</P>
<P>
The hard beak is often still attached to the tentacles. To remove it, squeeze 
the thick center part near the cut end, pushing the beak out (Step 3). Discard 
the beak, rinse the tentacles and again drain on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the tube section, reach inside and pull out the long, clear quill 
(Step 4); discard. Beginning at the uncut end, squeeze the tube between your 
thumb and forefinger to remove the entrails (Step 5). 
</P>
<P>
Peel off and discard the speckled skin with your fingers (Step 6). Rinse the 
mantles inside and out and drain again on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Frying is one of the easiest ways to prepare squid. Slice the mantles crosswise 
into 1/4-inch rings (Step 7). Dredge the tentacles and rings in flour, dip into 
beaten egg and then dust with fresh breadcrumbs. Deep-fat fry until golden 
brown. Serve warm with lemon wedges.

SHOPPING: LESS IS MORE: NO FAT, NO YOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cholesterol watchers can look forward to the debut this month of a new 
cholesterol-free egg noodle substitute. 
</P>
<P>
The word "substitute" may sound like a warning that you'll be getting a poor 
imitation of the real thing. But these noodles cook, look and taste like 
regular egg pasta. 
</P>
<P>
They're called No Yolks, in honor of the absence of the cholesterol-rich 
portion of the egg. The noodles do include eggs -- but only the whites. The 
other ingredients are enriched durum wheat flour and enriched corn flour, which 
provides a faint egg-yolk color. 
</P>
<P>
No Yolks can be used in any noodle dish -- salads, main dishes, soups and so 
forth. Manufactured by Foulds Inc. of Libertyville, Ill., they come in three 
widths -- medium, broad and extra-broad -- and cost about $1.25 for a 12-ounce 
bag. They'll be introduced in some independent markets next week, in Hughes 
Markets the following week, with wider distribution anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the nutrition information on the product label, a 2-ounce serving 
(dry measure) of No Yolks contains 210 calories, 10 fewer than 2 ounces of 
regular egg noodles. Protein and carbohydrate content are the same. Fat content 
is 1 gram lower (2 grams in No Yolks, 3 in regular egg noodles). Interestingly, 
the sodium content is higher -- 40 milligrams in No Yolks compared to 10 in 
regular noodles. But the cholesterol content drops to 0 in the substitute 
compared to 51 milligrams (a United States Department of Agriculture figure) in 
conventional egg noodles. 
</P>
<P>
Health Valley Foods Inc., of Irwindale, has recently launched several fat-free 
items. 
</P>
<P>
The first to appear, in May, were fat-free cookies, little powerhouses of fiber 
and fruit that come in five flavors: apple, date, Hawaiian fruit, apricot and 
raisin-oatmeal. Reading the label is like scanning the shelves at a 
natural-foods store. The Hawaiian fruit cookies contain a whole-grain-and-fiber 
blend made of organic whole wheat and oats; concentrated pineapple, pear and 
apple juices; papaya, pineapple, raisins, dates, banana flakes and mango. They 
also contain soy lecithin, high-chromium yeast and dulse, a sea vegetable that 
functions as a source of dietary fiber and as a thickening agent. Three of 
these cookies provide 75 calories, 3 grams dietary fiber, no cholesterol and 
less than 1 milligram of fat. 
</P>
<P>
The "fat-free" label for products that contain a trace of fat is perfectly 
legitimate, according to Bernie Landes, director of education at Health Valley 
Foods. "There is no food that is 100% fat-free unless it is synthetic," he 
said, explaining that small amounts of oil occur naturally in whole grains and 
tiny traces of fat may appear even in fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations give companies a choice of declaring less than 1 milligram of fat 
on the label or rounding off to the nearest gram. And a product with a 
naturally occurring but nutritionally insignificant quantity of fat is entitled 
to be called fat-free, Landes said. 
</P>
<P>
Health Valley introduced fat-free muffins and fruit bars in July, followed by 
jumbo cookies later that month. Look for these products in supermarkets and 
also in natural foods stores. You'll pay about $1.89 for a package of 16 small 
or 9 jumbo cookies; the muffins are $2.69 for six, and the individually 
packaged fruit bars retail for about $2.49 for a package of four. 
</P>
<P>
Another product aimed at the health-conscious customer is Spicer's Wheat 
Snacks. These are tiny hollow morsels that look like kibble or bits of elbow 
macaroni. They are made from expanded wheat kernels and are intended to keep 
you feeling so full you won't be tempted to consume rich, fattening foods. 
</P>
<P>
Flavors include natural, chocolate, Cheddar cheese, barbecue and sour cream and 
onion. The natural flavor tastes sweet, as does the chocolate, which has a dark 
chocolate color but not its distinctive flavor. Spicer's suggests combining 
either of these with low-fat milk for a breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/2-ounce packs are handy to carry about when you're on the run and 
unable to stop for a conventional meal. Although the snacks contain no 
cholesterol, they are not fat-free. A 1-ounce serving contains 5 grams of fat 
and 100 calories, according to the label. And the ingredients list indicates 
that corn oil has been added. 
</P>
<P>
The snacks sell for about 99 cents a pack, and they're available at a variety 
of outlets, including major chain markets.

LOS LOBOS RETURNS TO OLD HAUNTS ON NEW LP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic; 
his pieces regularly appear in the Calendar section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One reason Los Lobos took so long to record its new album, "The Neighborhood," 
was, ironically, the huge success of the East Los Angeles-spawned quintet's "La 
Bamba" single. 
</P>
<P>
The group's last album of original songs -- 1987's "By the Light of the Moon" 
-- was a dark, moving series of tales about the troubled pursuit of the 
American Dream, seen inescapably through a barrio perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the most culturally arresting and musically embracing work by a Los 
Angeles-based group in nearly a decade, the graceful, warm-spirited collection 
sold a respectable 400,000 copies and was named to the year-end Top 10 lists of 
numerous critics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Moon" was almost totally eclipsed in the public mind by the runaway 
success a few months later of Los Lobos' next recording venture: several songs 
for the soundtrack of "La Bamba," the film biography of '50s Mexican-American 
rock star Ritchie Valens. The soundtrack album sold more than 2 million copies, 
and Los Lobos' title track spent weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
The natural thing from a commercial standpoint would have been for Los Lobos to 
return with another collection of oldies. But that would have meant setting 
aside the compelling vision that made "Moon" and the earlier "How Will the Wolf 
Survive?" recordings so memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the quintet released "La Pistola y El Corazon," an album of Mexican 
folk music. The album sold about 100,000 copies -- impressive for such a daring 
venture, but negligible when compared to "La Bamba." 
</P>
<P>
Louie Perez and David Hidalgo, the group's primary songwriters, now admit that 
Los Lobos was, in some ways, buying time with the "La Pistola" album. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sad part of the 'Moon' album (experience) was that it was 
overshadowed by 'La Bamba,' " said Hidalgo, who also sings lead on most Los 
Lobos tunes. He was sitting with Perez on the porch of Perez's old family house 
in the Belvedere district of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to see the crowds start getting bigger at the shows," Hidalgo 
said, "but we would wonder sometimes why these people were in the theater. Was 
it to see us or just because of the movie?" 
</P>
<P>
The "Pistola" project, he said, was designed to salute the Mexican folk music 
that the group played for years at weddings and dances in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"The Neighborhood," which will figure prominently in the group's Oct. 19 
concert at the Greek Theatre, features a few bluesy, high-spirited workouts 
that should appeal to "La Bamba" fans, but mainly the album radiates with the 
disarming artistic vision exhibited in "By the Light of the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos -- which also consists of singer-guitarist Cesar Rosas, bassist 
Conrad Lozano and saxophonist Steve Berlin -- began work on the new album in 
late 1988, expecting to finish in time for release last January. But writing it 
took longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we ever thought of trying to make 'La Bamba II,' " Perez said. 
"That would have been ridiculous. But there's no doubt that during the course 
of writing the songs for this album there was this thing looming over you . . . 
the thought that you have to live up to the commercial success that we had with 
'La Bamba.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we told ourselves a few times that maybe we shouldn't be as dark and 
as introspective as 'Moon' . . . that maybe we should do something more 
accessible," he said. "But every time we started going too far in that 
direction, we found ourselves stopping and clearing the table . . . starting 
all over, getting back to something that really meant something to us." 
</P>
<P>
The four original members of Los Lobos (Berlin joined the group in the '80s) 
were friends at Garfield High School, but were in separate rock bands until 
getting together in the early '70s. Disillusioned by only being able to play 
Top 40 hits at clubs and dances with their bands, the four friends began 
exploring acoustic Mexican music in their off hours. 
</P>
<P>
They enjoyed it so much -- and found such a positive reaction to it -- that 
they switched styles, playing hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 
1980. Eventually, however, Los Lobos got caught up in the energy and 
imagination that was being generated by bands on the Hollywood club circuit, 
and the group shifted to rock. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, an undercurrent of social commentary began to surface and Los Lobos 
stepped up to an entirely new creative level. 
</P>
<P>
Images of the band members' old neighborhood surface in some of the songs on 
the new album. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to call the album 'The Neighborhood,' " Perez said. "It (the 
title song) was one of the last songs we wrote for the album, and it seemed to 
tie things together. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a song about urban decay and drugs and everything . . . about the way 
each person in a family is affected by the pressures of the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from the usual news routines of gang violence and drive-bys 
and everything else, but there's no reason to lose hope," Perez said. "And 
that's what we do in our music. We try to be constructive, give people some of 
that hope." 
</P>
<P>
Perez dug deeper into the band's philosophy and past. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a decision a long time ago . . . whether to just be a good sock 
hop band or something more," he said. "And I think the answer to that question 
had a lot to do with where we came from . . . this neighborhood."

LOWER DOSES OF AZT FOUND EFFECTIVE, LESS TOXIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low doses of the expensive AIDS drug AZT appear to be as effective as and less 
toxic than standard doses, according to two separate studies involving patients 
from California and across the country that are being published in today's New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Publication of the studies is likely to encourage more AIDS physicians to 
recommend doses of AZT -- azidothymidine -- for their patients that are 
substantially lower than the doses of 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams a day that were 
common several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many physicians already recommend lower doses, as the data supporting this 
approach has been publicized informally and at medical meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard of practice (today) is to use 500 to 600 milligrams a day," said 
Dr. Harry Hollander, the chief AIDS physician at the UC Medical Center in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, who is not an author of either study, added that the major exception 
is for AIDS patients with nervous-system complications. It is not clear that 
low doses are effective for such patients. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Burroughs Wellcome Co., which manufactures AZT, recommends that AIDS 
patients be prescribed 200 milligrams of AZT every four hours for four weeks, 
and after that 100 milligrams of AZT every four hours. The basis for this 
recommendation is one of the New England Journal studies, whose primary author 
is Dr. Margaret A. Fischl of the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 524 patients, Fischl and her colleagues found that this level of 
daily doses of AZT "was at least as effective as a higher dose and was less 
toxic," but that some patients still developed anemia, a common complication of 
the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The second study included 28 patients who received an even lower daily dose of 
AZT -- 50 milligrams every four hours. Most of the patients were treated for 
more than 40 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The research team, headed by Dr. Ann C. Collier of the University of Washington 
School of Medicine in Seattle, found that this very low dose had "clinical and 
virologic effects" similar to those of higher daily doses. They concluded that 
"the minimal effective dose" of AZT "has yet to be determined" and called for 
larger studies of the effects of 200 to 300 milligrams of AZT a day. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander said the very low doses of AZT are likely to be most useful for 
patients who cannot tolerate 500 to 600 milligrams a day and for patients who 
are simultaneously taking experimental AIDS drugs. He cautioned that patients 
who receive very low doses of AZT may be at increased risk of developing 
drug-resistant strains of the AIDS virus. 
</P>

<P>
ETHICS: A NEW REPORT CONTENDS THE MORAL FIBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS DEFINITELY 
WEAKENING, AND IT PLACES THE BLAME FOR A GENERATION'S DOWNFALL SQUARELY ON 
PARENTS, TEACHERS AND EMPLOYERS.

Michael Josephson has seen the future, and it doesn't work -- at least for him. 
He sees high school students who cheated on exams becoming jet airline 
mechanics who falsify maintenance reports. He sees legions of young job 
applicants claiming degrees they don't have to get jobs they aren't qualified 
for. He sees a tooth-and-nail scramble for economic survival, reward and 
prestige that will trample proper conduct, honesty and altruism into a sticky, 
carpet-ruining mess. 
</P>
<P>
And Josephson believes he knows who the culprits will be: People between 18 and 
30, raised in an environment of greed, corruption, selfishness and dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the independently wealthy, former law school professor's grim 
vision is a new report from his ethics institute on the conduct of America's 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for release Friday, "The Ethics of American Youth: A Report on the 
Values and Behaviors of the 18-30 Generation," argues that there are 
"undeniable signs that the moral fiber of our country is weakening and that, as 
this generation takes its place in society in decision-making positions, the 
situation is likely to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
The 60-page study from the Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute for the 
Advancement of Ethics asserts that "an unprecedented proportion of today's 
young generation lacks commitment to core moral values such as honesty, respect 
for others, personal responsibility and civic duty." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson, who has repeatedly demonstrated a flair for both publicity and 
confrontation, acknowledges that the report is potentially the most 
controversial work to come out of his foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the combative Josephson, who founded the Marina del Rey-based 
institute five years ago in honor of his parents, says he is eager for 
argument, if it promotes a better understanding of the ethical state of the 
nation and the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he is proved wrong, Josephson, whose two consuming interests are his 
ethics work and his 14-year-old son, probably won't be fazed. This week, he has 
been cheerfully calling attention to a profile of him in the current issue of 
California magazine. One of his favorite lines: "He plays the next-door 
neighbor who shows up at your door with a shovelful of dog poop." 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Josephson, who made his money in publishing and bar exam review 
courses, stands firmly by the report's findings, bolstered by an array of 
statistics and other evidence from surveys of young people, studies of academic 
honesty and resume fraud, sexual behavior, criminal patterns, voting habits, 
sports conduct and student loan defaults. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a natural disposition to think that wherever there's bad news, there 
must be offsetting good news if you have a picture this bleak," he said in an 
interview. "I will tell you, I don't find any offsetting good news." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Josephson believes the news is so bad that he has labeled his targets 
"the I-deserve-it" or "IDI" generation, a tag he invented in hopes it will 
catch on much as "the Me Decade" became a buzz phrase of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Some figures cited in the report: 
</P>
<P>
* A 1989 Gallup poll found that 89% of those ages 18 to 29 thought their 
generation was more selfish than previous generations. Moreover, 82% believed 
their generation was more materialistic. 
</P>
<P>
* A long-term UCLA survey of college freshmen found that in 1970, some 39% 
thought financial success was important or essential. In 1989, the figure 
jumped to 75%. In contrast, in 1970, 82% of college freshmen thought that 
"developing a meaningful philosophy of life" was important; by 1989, the number 
was exactly half that, 41%. 
</P>
<P>
* Cheating is rampant in high school and college. The Josephson report cites 
various studies showing that, overall, about 75% of high school students admit 
to cheating, while about 50% of college students do. A 1986 study of 2,200 
California secondary students found that 73% of students said they had cheated 
on a test at least once; 57% admitted they had cheated a few times. The 
consequences of cheating? They're usually mild, and the odds of getting caught 
are tiny, the report says. A Claremont College doctoral candidate told 
Josephson's researchers that he had accepted money from a close friend to write 
a paper for her. The grad student is quoted as saying: "It was a challenge. And 
it was also 50 bucks. For $500, I'd take pictures of myself naked." 
</P>
<P>
* Experts on resume fraud quoted in the report say that anywhere from 12% to 
30% of resumes contain "deliberate inaccuracies." One expert told institute 
researchers that a young man who claimed he had a degree justified his lie by 
saying he "fully intended" to earn the degree someday. 
</P>
<P>
These examples represent only a fraction of the evidence marshaled in the 
report to support its contentions. 
</P>
<P>
But Josephson is convinced the numbers add up to an alarming total. Moreover, 
he is certain that today's parents, teachers, employers and public servants 
have only themselves to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't our view that these are moral mutants," Josephson said. "These are 
not people who had some genetic disposition toward immoral conduct. But they 
grew up in a society where misbehavior was all around them, where people were 
not enforcing the rules of ethics. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Young people, especially, are not apt to develop philosophical theories about 
ethics. They adopt very pragmatic theories about ethics. What do they get 
rewarded for? What do they get punished for? What seems to work? 
</P>
<P>
"So my view," he continued, "is this generation is the price we are paying for 
our own moral deterioration. But rather than just rag on them or bash them, 
that's not as relevant to me as what does it mean for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"This is, in fact, the generation who are entering the work place. They're 
going to be our airline mechanics; they're going to be our bankers; they're 
going to be our lawyers. And if a higher proportion of them . . . have a 
history of cheating and lying, what can we expect it to be like in the '90s as 
they gain power?" 
</P>
<P>
While Josephson finds no reasons for optimism, the report notes that others see 
brighter prospects for America's youth. The report cites in a footnote the 
William T. Grant Foundation, which last year concluded that the popular 
perception of "a 'troubled and irresponsible' younger generation is largely 
mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
But Samuel Helprin, an author of the Grant Foundation report, said in a 
telephone interview that the study was not directed specifically at values: 
"What we found is that despite horrendous trends . . . all the social 
pathologies (that affect young people), the majority of American youth were 
somehow making it. But that's a little bit different from saying their values 
are OK." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Dorothy Stoneman, head of a national program aimed at 
helping poor young people build housing for the homeless, said she finds "a 
tremendous craving among young people for honesty" from adults. 
</P>
<P>
Stoneman, whose National Youth Build Coalition is based in the Boston area, 
also said she finds young people have "a tremendous craving to belong to 
something that represents the highest ideals of society." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson, however, is unimpressed with reports that pure altruism lurks in the 
hearts of the young. For instance, his report concedes that volunteerism among 
the young may be increasing. But it quickly points out that "the moral 
significance of this is clouded by the fact that many 'volunteers' perform 
services as part of mandatory school community service programs, and a high 
proportion admit that their main goal was to put something good on their 
resumes." 
</P>
<P>
Even younger generation members who reject the greed of their peers don't 
escape Josephson's lash. Labeled "Don't want its" in the report, they are 
lambasted for having "a different form of self-centeredness characterized by 
avoidance of discomfort rather than by the pursuit of pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Here, Josephson sees an atypical glimmer of hope. Namely, that the 
preoccupation with self can be turned to society's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The good part of the news is that all is not lost because as a generation, 
they are very very self-centered, which means they'll do whatever it takes," he 
explained. "Well, what if we make it that they have to do right?"

NEW RECRUITS IN FIGHT FOR GAY RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISM: ORANGE COUNTY SUPPORT GROUP BECOMES A POLITICAL FORCE IN SUCCESSFUL 
BID TO STAGE CONVENTION FOR THE LOVED ONES OF HOMOSEXUALS ON THE HOME TURF OF 
ANTI-GAY LEADERS.

Sandra Moore never paid attention to jokes about gays. Then her son, Sean 
Holden, told her that he was homosexual. He was 21 and scared to death she 
would reject him. 
</P>
<P>
Moore reassured Sean that she loved him no matter what, and from that day on, 
she became an activist. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Moore, an executive secretary at an Anaheim-based electronics 
company, was making small talk when a co-worker made an offhand remark about 
the weather that included a derogatory term for gays. 
</P>
<P>
"His words got me right in the pit of my stomach," Moore said. "He thought he 
was making a joke, and the words hurt me incredibly. I told him it wasn't 
funny, and we didn't talk after that." 
</P>
<P>
Moore is typical of the people who have joined Parents and Friends of Lesbians 
and Gays, an organization that in recent years has transformed itself from a 
support group for gays' loved ones into a key player in the struggle to secure 
equal rights and societal acceptance for gays. 
</P>
<P>
This week, in a sign of its new aggressiveness, PFLAG is holding its 
international convention in Orange County, the back yard of such anti-gay 
figures as the Rev. Lou Sheldon, head of the Traditional Values Coalition, and 
U.S. Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
"The conservative politics and the hate tactics used against our children have 
pushed us to fight back," said Elena Layland, president of the group's Orange 
County chapter. "We love our children. And we're coming out of our own closets 
to show them just how much we love them." 
</P>
<P>
"We want the conservatives to know that they don't have a monopoly on the 
family," added Paulette Goodman, national president of PFLAG. "Parents of gays 
and lesbians are just as traditional. We really don't believe what people like 
Dornan and Dannemeyer are saying. We are very much part of the traditional 
family. And nobody is going to tell us otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people from throughout the United States and abroad are expected 
to attend the four-day convention, which begins Friday at the Hyatt Regency 
Alicante in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the ninth annual convention is "Reaching Out Into the '90s." 
Thirty-two workshops with subjects ranging from "Gay and Lesbian Youth" to 
"Breaking Down Stereotypes" will be offered. Last year, 300 people attended the 
national convention in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
To win the right to host the convention, the Orange County chapter had to vie 
with one in Charlotte, N.C., which had sought the gathering because of 
Charlotte's visibility as the hometown of ultraconservative U.S. Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R.-N.C.), one of the gay community's most ardent opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's PFLAG won the convention in part because of its fight to keep 
its speakers' bureau from being barred at Corona del Mar High School, where 
teacher Mike Marino had invited gays and lesbians to his psychology class for 
more than a decade. A handful of parents had attacked the bureau in 1988 and 
1989, claiming that the speakers were "recruiting" into the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
Though the PFLAG speakers have not been invited back into the school, the fight 
energized the chapter and won extensive local press coverage. Indeed, in making 
its case to be selected to host the convention, the Orange County chapter 
provided the national federation with a 20-page scrapbook that detailed its 
role in this and other controversies. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers' bureau controversy was the catalyst for Orange County's PFLAG to 
become more active and "radical," said Layland, who joined the chapter four 
years ago with her husband, Raymond, when their 15-year-old son, Todd, told 
them that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
People don't think of parents as being outspoken and radical about gay rights, 
Layland said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think of us as being rather meek," she said. "They think of us as 
being a group that sits around and holds hands for an hour. Well, that's not 
the case. We're fighters now." 
</P>
<P>
To get the convention started, chapter leaders realized that they had to 
attract more members. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, there were only 45 dues-paying members in the Orange County 
chapter, said Mel Trickery, a retired Los Angeles County probation supervisor 
who has two gay children. Though the group was meeting regularly each month, it 
was not attracting new members. 
</P>
<P>
"The chapter was from the old school of thinking; they didn't want to stir any 
waters," Trickery said. "Some members wanted everything to be kept at a status 
quo. But with the attack on the (speakers') bureau, members realized that they 
had to fight back for their children." 
</P>
<P>
So the chapter's leaders became more visible by attending gay community 
functions and appearing on national talk shows such as "Geraldo!" PFLAG members 
also attended every gay pride event in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As members of OC-PFLAG, Sandra Moore and her son Sean, now 22, marched side by 
side in the Long Beach and West Hollywood pride parades, their arms wrapped 
around each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was with my mom, telling the world I was proud to be gay," he said. "To 
have her next to me was something I had never even thought of. It was emotional 
for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
Today, membership for the chapter has more than quadrupled, with more than 204 
members. The chapter is still growing, Layland said. It is now the largest 
chapter in Southern California, with more members than Los Angeles and San 
Diego. (PFLAG, which also welcomes membership from gays, grew out of the 1979 
gay and lesbian march on Washington and now has 200 local chapters nationwide.) 
</P>
<P>
With more members, the Orange County chapter has been able to concentrate on 
raising the $40,000 the convention is expected to cost and on organizing the 
event, Layland said. Finding a hotel was one hurdle. Layland found herself 
explaining to hotel management how much controversy the convention might 
attract because of the group's membership. Many hotel managers were 
accommodating; others were not. 
</P>
<P>
One hotel manager in Newport Beach wanted to know how many gay people were 
attending and wanted to charge an exorbitant amount for the rental of 
convention rooms, said Layland, who declined to identify the hotel. Hotels do 
not regularly charge for convention rooms and instead make money with dinners 
and drinks, said Layland, who has organized conventions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel management was homophobic," Layland said. "They made it known that 
they did not want such a convention in the hotel premises. I was stunned." 
</P>
<P>
In August, the chapter faced its most difficult hurdle when Rick Heckenlaible, 
one of the chapter's leaders and head of its speakers' bureau, died of AIDS. A 
cheerleader for the organization, Heckenlaible, 41, had kept morale high for 
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
Several days before he died, Heckenlaible was still worried about the 
convention and was asking questions about how well it was going, Layland said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick's death left us wondering, 'How do we continue with the convention?' " 
Layland said. "The convention was a dream Rick had for all of us. But we know 
we all have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Heckenlaible's dream is fast becoming a reality for PFLAG member and 
volunteer David Fuller, 22, who arrived in Orange County from Ellensburg, 
Wash., a year ago. As a teen-ager, he never thought of being truly open about 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"A PFLAG convention in Orange County proves that the county isn't as 
closed-minded as people may think," Fuller said. "Gays and lesbians can be 
loved and supported in Orange County just like anywhere else."

TELEVISION: THE LATE-ARRIVING FIRST NEW EPISODE OF FOX'S HIP SERIES SQUARES OFF 
AGAINST NBC'S HIT 'COSBY.' BUT THIS TIME, 'THE SIMPSONS' OPTS FOR THE TENDER, 
NOT THE OFFBEAT.

<P>
It's clear now that two formidable competitors loom for "The Simpsons" on 
Thursday nights. One is "The Cosby Show" on NBC. The other is "The Simpsons" 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of the Fox series may find it impossible to watch its long-awaited 
first-run return at 8 tonight (Channels 11 and 6) without comparing it -- 
unfavorably -- with the weird and brilliant best episodes of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons" has been such an eclectic, inventive and shrewdly written show 
since its Jan. 14 premiere as a half-hour animated comedy that even second and 
third viewings of the same episodes still produce surprises. No wonder it was 
such a smash hit on Sunday nights, giving Fox giddy hope that "The Simpsons" 
could challenge even that glittering monarch of prime time, his royal Cosbyship 
himself. Thus, Fox packed off his royal Dudeship Bart and his family to 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
What an epic war this would be. 
</P>
<P>
So complex is "The Simpsons" to produce, however, that the show's fall debut 
has come late, preceded by its reruns getting destroyed in the ratings opposite 
first-run episodes of "The Cosby Show." But now comes pay-back time, right? You 
anticipated America's favorite buck-toothed family delivering so spectacularly 
tonight that they would light up the sky, to say nothing of the Nielsens. 
</P>
<P>
Instead you feel a warm glow, a half hour that's, well, very nice. It's 
frequently good, but never great a la "The Simpsons" of old -- a sweet and 
tender story following the attempts by underachieving (but no longer as proud 
of it) Bart to avoid failing the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
The episode has its moments. Horrified by the prospect of repeating a grade, 
Bart gets customary fatherly support from Homer: "At least you'll be bigger 
than the other kids." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's some funny business with the nerdy class smarty-pants, 
Poindexter. And as always, "The Simpsons" is an unusual-for-TV, kid's-eye-view 
of the world, managing to tap genuine emotions and experiences, from violent 
video games to the euphoria of learning that school's been canceled by the 
season's first heavy snow. Yes, this is that rare series about kids that is 
written by people you can envision actually having been kids. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, tonight's over-sugary episode is not "The Simpsons" in top form. 
</P>
<P>
Coming closer is an episode arriving in two weeks (the only other one supplied 
in advance by Fox) -- a much darker, stranger, meaner and funnier story that 
finds Homer's boss, the evil Charles Montgomery Burns, running for governor to 
counteract bad publicity about his pollution-spewing nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
The half hour starts with the discovery of a mutant three-eyed fish in a stream 
by the plant and then proceeds to lampoon just about everything in sight, from 
political campaigns to the media to criminal polluters like Burns. "He's one of 
the most despicable men who ever lived," Marge says. Obviously. Why else would 
Homer support him? 
</P>
<P>
Mutant three-eyed fish. That's "The Simpsons."

CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH NEA RENEWED

<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) renewed a demand Wednesday that the 
National Endowment for the Arts be abolished or subject to stringent new 
controls in the wake of the acquittal last week of a Cincinnati museum and its 
director on obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
As Rohrabacher and other conservative opponents of the NEA began marshaling 
their forces for key congressional votes expected today or Friday, they began 
linking the fate of the arts endowment with the Cincinnati verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The Contemporary Arts Center of Cincinnati and its director, Dennis Barrie, had 
been charged with pandering obscenity in a misdemeanor indictment after 
displaying a controversial traveling exhibit of photographs by the late Robert 
Mapplethorpe that were partly funded by the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher asserted that the verdict, which was returned Friday by an 
eight-person jury, established that NEA support of any art project effectively 
renders the art, no matter how controversial it may be, impervious to obscenity 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
NEA supporters, led by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.) and Sen. Claiborne Pell 
(D-R.I.), have sought to avoid enactment of controls over specific kinds of 
work the NEA can support by barring funding only if work is judged by a court 
to be obscene under prevailing U.S. Supreme Court precedents. 
</P>
<P>
"No court will hold obscene a work which is deemed to have artistic merit by a 
federal art panel," Rohrabacher said. "In fact, (NEA reauthorization 
legislation proposed by Williams and Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.)) would open the 
door to federal subsidies for anything, no matter how freakish, pornographic or 
sacrilegious -- that an NEA panel would approve." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher released a letter sent to members of Congress by the leaders of 20 
conservative political and religious groups that complained that "a court in 
Cincinnati has just decided that even the Mapplethorpe S &amp; M and child porn 
photographs are not obscene." (Five of the 175 photos depicted in the 
Mapplethorpe show, on which the Cincinnati charges were based, depicted 
homoerotic images and two showed children with genitals exposed.) 
</P>
<P>
Separately, it was learned that South Central Bell Telephone Co. had cut off 
billing service to a San Francisco-based group raising money to oppose Sen. 
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in his reelection campaign. The California organization, 
the First Amendment Crisis Team, has published advertisements in at least three 
newspapers urging readers to dial a 900 telephone number and have a $9.99 
contribution to the anti-Helms group billed to their own telephones. 
</P>
<P>
South Central Bell, a subsidiary of Bell South, said it took the action under a 
corporate policy, adopted earlier this year, barring use of 900 number billing 
services for political activities.

</P>
<P>
FILM: FROM TAVERNIER, AN ANTI-WAR STORY THAT CELEBRATES LIFE AND LOVE.

Bertrand Tavernier's "Life and Nothing But" (Music Hall) is a cause for 
rejoicing. More than just a beautiful or affecting film, more than one with 
great performances and a significant subject -- all of which it is and has -- 
it's a movie with breadth of vision and strength of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
This is an anti-war film that doesn't show a moment of battle or drop of blood. 
It's a dirge for the dead that somehow turns into a celebration of life, a 
social drama that constantly erupts into moments of macabre comedy, a love 
story with barely a moment of on-screen lovemaking, hardly even a kiss. In many 
ways, it's an anachronism: a deeply, almost defiantly old-fashioned movie, 
which helps reveal our own world through a passionate embrace of one long past. 
</P>
<P>
The story is intimate, but the canvas is epic. The action, spread over several 
days in the lives of three people, widens to a speaking cast of more than 60. 
The backdrop -- France's Verdun and Grezancourt immediately following World War 
I -- is so vast that the characters are constantly swallowed up in broad 
vistas, sweeps of countryside, hills and huge echoing factories, while 
remaining clear, distinct personalities. It's a prodigious ensemble recreation. 
Tavernier, like all first-rate film artists, makes the difficult look 
effortless. 
</P>
<P>
The movie gives us a microcosm: the passionate encounter between an insouciant 
society woman and a rough old soldier. And a macrocosm: the turmoil and 
confusion of France after a war that claimed 350,000 French lives. If that war 
is over, it's far from forgotten. Thousands of dead or missing remain 
unaccounted for and the movie's protagonist, Major Dellaplane (Philippe 
Noiret), is in charge of identifying the corpses. 
</P>
<P>
It's an almost maddening task. Scavengers trail the bereaved. The personal 
effects of the dead are red-tagged and hawked on tables. Villages try to switch 
their boundary lines so they can claim more casualties. Mediocre sculptors do 
land-office business in monuments and commemorative statues. 
</P>
<P>
The corpses are often unidentifiable; even their nationality, French or German, 
occasionally indeterminate. To make matters worse, live mines still 
periodically explode and kill. And the French High Command, to Dellaplane's 
disgust, have demanded that, within days, he come up with an Unknown Soldier, 
to be interred with full pomp at the Arc de Triomphe. 
</P>
<P>
It was the search for WWI's Unknown Soldier that first inspired Tavernier and 
Jean Cosmos' screenplay; there really was a Major Dellaplane. Here, the 
imagined chaos around Noiret -- who sometimes gives the impression of being the 
only officer around who's actually seen battle -- is appallingly funny, 
appallingly sad, and, sometimes, just plain appalling. 
</P>
<P>
Tavernier's viewpoint is resolutely unsentimental. Yet it's not empty of 
feeling. In the midst of this madness, Dellaplane meets two women, both seeking 
a missing husband or fiancee, both united by an improbable coincidence: a 
Parisian industrialist's daughter-in-law, Irene (Sabine Azema), and a country 
schoolteacher named Alice (Pascale Vignal). The bitter backdrop accentuates the 
love story between Dellaplane and Irene: a curious, whiplash romance, whose 
cadences and currents resemble those of movie romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Some will find this romance too derivative; they'll be more correct than 
they'll know. Tavernier has said that Dellaplane is based partially on John 
Wayne in John Ford's cavalry films and Irene on Katharine Hepburn in her 
screwball comedies for Hawks and Cukor. Yet, this influence doesn't diminish 
"Life"; only a hopeless snob would complain. Noiret and Azema, two brilliant 
actors, deliver performances of terrific emotion, wit and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Noiret's priceless hangdog look, his mix of melancholy and affectionate 
irascibility -- the qualities for which audiences loved him as the bearlike 
projectionist of "Cinema Paradiso" -- here seem charged with heroic dignity, 
weary calm. Opposite him, Azema has lithe reactions, incandescent flirtiness; 
she's a firebird veiled in frost. When they argue with each other, it's 
electric. When they connect, there's a melting poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
In Tavernier's last film, "Beatrice," he showed a medieval world bounded by 
brute passion and elemental force. Here, his portrayal of the social chaos of 
war's aftermath is devastating. Throughout the early sections, he reinforces 
the overview by keeping almost constantly in long-shot -- by dwarfing the 
characters and letting cinematographer Bruno de Keyzer bathe everything in a 
cold, bluish light. 
</P>
<P>
The sometimes harsh, sliding, camera movements, the near-surreal images of nuns 
on horseback on a bleak strip of beach, the overhead shots of the rat's maze in 
which Dellaplane works: all these reinforce the sense of a world and time out 
of joint. Yet the universe of "Life," for all its jitteriness and breadth, 
becomes a coherent one and finally, lovely and heartening as well. 
</P>

STAGE WATCH: SHAKY START FOR L.A.'S 'STAND-UP TRAGEDY' IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Cain's "Stand-Up Tragedy" was the toast of Los Angeles last year. Now, on 
Broadway, it's burned toast. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't quite burned to a crisp. 
</P>
<P>
The Mark Taper Forum-Hartford Stage Company production, which opened last 
Thursday at Criterion Center Stage Right on Broadway, received a deadly notice 
from Frank Rich of the New York Times: Cain "merely restates the obvious" and 
wrote "a denouement that, for all its tragic pretensions, proves laughably 
melodramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Rich wrote that "the gimmickry of the script" and "the busyness of the 
production . . . do succeed in insinuating 'Stand-Up Tragedy' into a 
theatergoer's mind -- if not as an intellectual or emotional stimulant, then as 
the relentless source of a throbbing headache." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reviews were not so negative. Clive Barnes of the New York Post 
called the play a "stunner" and "very much to be seen, and seen now while its 
temperature and climate are both white-hot." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Winer of Newsday found the play too long and better suited for 
off-Broadway, "and yet. There is so much heart onstage here, so much smart talk 
and stage savvy -- not to mention an authentic urgency that earns its claim to 
the theater." 
</P>
<P>
But Rich's word usually has the most influence at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for producers Charles B. Moss Jr., Brent Peek and Donald Taffner 
said the show will not close Sunday, despite Rich's review. "It needs to do 
better," he said, "but they're going on a week-to-week basis." It's possible 
that a more favorable verdict might even emerge from the New York Times: The 
opinion of the newspaper's new Sunday critic, David Richards, has not yet 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mention of the Mark Taper Forum in the credits, the Taper did not 
invest in the Broadway production and won't suffer a loss if the show goes 
belly-up, said Taper managing director Stephen J. Albert. But the Taper is a 
participant in the show's royalty pool (taken from the gross) and its profits, 
if any should develop. 
</P>
<P>
NEW WORKS: The Taper's New Work Festival, which introduced "Stand-Up Tragedy" 
to Los Angeles two years ago, has scheduled 16 free workshops, readings and 
performance-art pieces for Oct. 22-Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
A double bill of Luis Alfaro's "Downtown" and John Steppling's "A Deep Tropical 
Tan" will open the festival Oct. 22-23. It's the first of 10 two-day workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Other workshops include Quincy Long's "Whole Hearted" (Oct. 24-25), Thomas 
George Carter's "Hells Kitchen Ablaze" (Oct. 27-28), Sybille Pearson's 
"Untitled Play" (Oct. 31-Nov. 1), William S. Yellow Robe Jr.'s "The Pendleton 
Blanket" (Nov. 3-4), Han Ong's "The L.A. Plays: In a Lonely Country &amp; A 
Short List of Alternate Places" (Nov. 7-8). 
</P>
<P>
Plus Tony Kushner's "Perestroika" (Nov. 10-11; this is the sequel to his 
"Millennium Approaches," which played Taper Too earlier this year), Erin 
Cressida Wilson's "Cross-Dressing in the Depression" (Nov. 14-15), Peter 
Mattei's "Elixir Vitae" (Nov. 14-15) and Roy Conboy's "Camino 
Confusion/Confusion Street" (Nov. 17-18). 
</P>
<P>
Playwrights whose works will receive Monday readings are Sheri Bailey, Donald 
Freed, Hollye Levin, Adelaide Mackenzie, Bill Corbett and Ruth Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson noted that two-thirds of the 
playwrights are from the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Though admission is free, reservations are necessary: (213) 972-7392. 
</P>
<P>
LATC LABS: Los Angeles Theatre Center is opening a new Classic Theatre Lab, not 
long after it closed its Music Theatre Lab. 
</P>
<P>
The new lab will be directed by Roger Hendricks Simon, who has staged 
productions at a number of prestigious theaters, including the New York 
Shakespeare Festival, Lincoln Center, Yale Repertory Theatre, the Royal Court 
Theatre in London and the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell and producing director 
Diane White said that the "principal aim" of the new lab is "to draw from the 
immense pool of Los Angeles-based multicultural talent to develop and produce 
the classics from a particularly American point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bushnell and White said that the defunct Music Theatre Lab was 
supposed "to develop contemporary musical theater which addresses significant 
human, social and artistic issues. However, the work the lab has produced did 
not meet LATC's standards or fulfill those objectives, so we have chosen to 
disband it and develop musical theater through other means -- i.e., the 
commissioning of 'The Joni Mitchell Project' " (a commission to writer Henry 
Edwards and director David Schweizer resulted in a production that opens Nov. 
1). 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Kansas City, where he now lives, the Music Theatre Lab's director, 
Paul Hough, said that LATC's ethnic and women's theater labs "had a 
sociological concern as their inspiring ground, while the Music Theatre Lab had 
as its base an aesthetic concern. That was the basis of the problem. The 
comment being made was of more interest to Bill (Bushnell) than the 
aesthetics."

CITY GOES AFTER CONVENTION, FOR BETTER OR WORSE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SAN DIEGO IS APPARENTLY THE NO. 1 CONTENDER TO HOST REPUBLICAN 
DELEGATES IN THE SUMMER OF 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The lure is the 1992 Republican Convention -- which critics say won't help 
tourism, comes at the wrong time and is too expensive for a city that has no 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The city is San Diego -- which today is wooing the GOP by escorting delegates 
from the Republican National Committee to such sites as the zoo, Sea World and 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone involved says San Diego is the No. 1 contender for the event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardly a done deal," said Paul Downey, the spokesman for Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, "but we feel very confident." 
</P>
<P>
"The convention would be of incredible value to the city," said Downey, whose 
boss, despite being a Democrat, wrote a letter to President Bush in September 
that catapulted the city into the elite of leading contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Political insiders say San Diego's chances are greatly aided by White House 
official Sig Rogich, who is assistant to the president for public events and 
initiatives. Rogich, a former Las Vegas ad executive, is reported to be San 
Diego's biggest backer and a confidante of the president. 
</P>
<P>
Downey and other boosters estimate the economic impact as between $50 million 
and $100 million. The convention would follow on the heels of the America's 
Cup, the promoters of which say may bring in as much as $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
And, Downey and others say it's no problem that the sailing regatta, the 
baseball All-Star Game and two major arts festivals are already scheduled for 
that summer. 
</P>
<P>
"With the country facing a recession, San Diego needs to do everything it can 
to make itself recession-proof," he said. "That's the mayor's goal, and it's a 
happy problem to have too many events than too few." 
</P>
<P>
But while some herald the convention as one more sign of the coming of age of 
America's sixth-largest city, others say it's further evidence of San Diego 
wanting to be bigger than it is. 
</P>
<P>
Critics cite the city's recent struggle with a $60-million budget deficit until 
a series of controversial cuts were finally made. O'Connor has said not a penny 
of public money will go toward the GOP, although millions are being offered by 
rival contenders Cleveland, Houston, New Orleans and St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Clanton, a sociologist and political analyst at San Diego State 
University, said, "So who pays the additional expense, such as police and fire 
protection? To say such events benefit the community as a whole is really a 
bogus notion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard it in connection with the America's Cup, the baseball All-Star 
Game, the Super Bowl and now this. Usually, these events benefit a handful of 
people but are always sold differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the problem is, San Diego has an inferiority complex. It wants to be 
perceived as just as important as every other big city, but is it, really? It 
has to do with the gap of being the sixth-largest city in the country as 
opposed to the 17th-largest metropolitan area and the 26th major media market. 
The gap is a constant measure of the city's insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the new San Diego Convention Center said earlier that playing 
host to the Republicans would complicate scheduling for events are already 
booked for the summer of '92. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Liegler, the center's general manager, said Wednesday that while it would 
be "a privilege" to host the convention, many unanswered questions remain. He 
wants to know the exact window of time the GOP would want -- some say as much 
as six weeks, which means a number of existing bookings would have to be 
cleared. And, of course, there's always the question of who will pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that both the Democrats and Republicans usually want host cities to 
pick up anywhere between $8 million and $10 million," Liegler said. "So, the 
question is, if no public money is being used, who would pay for that?" 
</P>
<P>
Republican sources say private money is the most likely source. As Liegler 
said, the city must be a top contender, because the GOP "seems to be pursuing 
us more than we're pursuing them." 
</P>
<P>
The head of the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Assn. said Wednesday that his 
group now "strongly favors" the convention and is backing it "every step of the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Reint Reinders, the president of the group, said the city maintains about 
40,000 hotel rooms but needs only 17,000 on the convention's "peak nights." 
</P>
<P>
"True, August (the month the convention is scheduled) is a terrifically busy 
time for us, so some tourists would have to stay away, because conventioneers 
would be filling their rooms," Reinders said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the convention's pros and cons, Reinders said, "I don't think 
it would ever be a bad thing. It's a good thing because of the tremendous 
publicity it creates. It would take place on prime-time TV throughout the 
country, with an August sunset, the Convention Center and the bay serving as 
the backdrop to George Bush's renomination. Why, you can't buy that kind of 
exposure. I think it's wonderful. It could be an incredible spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wilson, the manager of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, said that he had 
been approached by city and GOP officials, who may want the use of his facility 
for as much as two nights, if not the entire convention. 
</P>
<P>
Liegler said he had been told that the GOP would stage all of its events at 
either the Convention Center or the stadium or alternate between both sites. He 
said those are among the questions to be decided later in the week by city and 
GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he was first asked for a "six-week window" of time in the summer of 
'92, and he laughed, telling them it would be impossible. The stadium is home 
to baseball's Padres and football's Chargers, both of which use the stadium 
during August. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Wilson said he can provide a two-week window to ready the stadium for 
what Reinders calls "the spectacle," but no more than that. 
</P>
<P>
The America's Cup sailing regatta finishes its finals in San Diego in May of 
that year, just two months before the Major League All-Star Game and three 
months before the convention. But Tom Ehman, head of the America's Cup 
Organizing Committee, said the convention would pose "no direct conflict" with 
his event. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of planning, the convention is a massive undertaking," Ehman said. 
"And there are only so many volunteers in a community such as this willing to 
help out with an America's Cup or a convention. It's a double-edged sword, 
really. You may have a lot of people burned out and not wanting to help with a 
big convention. But on the other hand, a lot of people may be up and running 
and ready to go, more skilled at helping out with the convention than they 
would have been before." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said he had been contacted by various unnamed officials, wanting to know 
if the America's Cup media center, the site of which has yet to be determined, 
could be maintained and used for the convention. Ehman said yes. 
</P>
<P>
Downey says that as many as 16,000 media representatives may come to the city 
for the GOP political convention, and the publicity is something San Diego 
can't pass up. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Clanton speculates that the Democrats -- of whom he is one -- are 
making a serious mistake by looking toward New York for their '92 convention, 
while the Republicans are cleverly eyeing an upbeat, relatively healthy Sun 
Belt city. 
</P>
<P>
As Downey said, San Diego is "an important swing city in a swing state" with 
the largest number of electoral votes. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the attractiveness is economic. If recession is a full-blown reality by 
the summer of '92, San Diego is not expected to fare as badly as the rest of 
the country, and that may lure Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a case of the rest of the country having the flu and us just 
having a cold," Ehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Clanton said the so-called spectacle factor may be the No. 1 reason 
San Diego is so attractive to the GOP, at a time when other cities are courting 
the party much more seriously and with much fatter pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite our mayor, who, at best is a nominal Democrat, what other city in the 
country is more Republican than San Diego?" Clanton said. "We have, for the 
most part, a Republican (City) Council and Republicans running nearly 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eyes of the nation, San Diego looks incredibly conservative. The 
perception is, it's all white, all blue eyes, all Republicans, all Navy, and 
what could be better for the GOP -- especially with war and a major recession 
looming as possibilities?"

FIREFIGHTERS SAY QUICKLY DEVISED STRATEGY WORKED 
</P>

<P>
With Santa Ana winds, four years of drought and an arsonist ready to strike, 
conditions in Ventura County were ideal this week for a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But -- unlike the destructive Santa Barbara blaze in June -- three brush fires 
that erupted outside Santa Paula and Fillmore were contained before they could 
damage a single house. 
</P>
<P>
Fire experts Wednesday cited five major factors: 
</P>
<P>
* Residents in Santa Paula and Fillmore, accustomed to brush fires in the area, 
made sure that their houses were protected with one of the most aggressive 
weed-clearing programs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
* Fire commanders were quick to map out an effective strategy as each blaze 
erupted. They chose to surround two of the fires and let them burn out while 
tackling another in a direct assault. 
</P>
<P>
* Fully aware of the extreme fire danger that the Santa Ana winds pose, fire 
units countywide were on alert. They responded quickly, in great force and had 
all the equipment they needed. 
</P>
<P>
* At critical times, firefighters got a break from the weather. One of the 
Santa Paula fires was brought under control partly because the wind suddenly 
died just as firefighters began their assault. 
</P>
<P>
* The brush itself was slower to burn than in Santa Barbara because other fires 
in the area in previous years had burned away older, tinder-dry areas. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the three fires broke out Monday night on the slopes of South 
Mountain in Santa Paula. Within 30 minutes, 15 engines from the Fillmore and 
Santa Paula fire departments were on the scene, trying to save about 25 houses 
on South Mountain Road southeast of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Santa Ana means strong winds, dry air, high temperatures, high fire 
danger and a lot of work," said Ventura County Battalion Chief Bob Bement, who 
headed the South Mountain firefight. 
</P>
<P>
The first firefighters on the scene were quick to praise area residents for 
removing weeds around their houses. All of the houses had brush cleared away 
for a radius of 20 to 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a nice clearing around the house," said a Fillmore firefighter as he 
hosed off some trees near South Mountain resident Mark Wintz's house Monday 
night, after the fire had swept by and left the house untouched. "It makes our 
job real easy." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Battalion Chief Dale Miller contrasted the county's aggressive 
weed-clearing program to the lack of one in Santa Barbara, where 500 houses 
were burned in June in a fire that caused an estimated $237 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
"In Santa Barbara, they had no abatement program and the brush was right up 
next to the houses," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters at the Santa Barbara blaze faced the added problem of the age of 
the brush. That area had not burned for 50 years and the brush, which 
firefighters call fuel, was dense and tinder dry from four years of drought. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the brush was only five years old in the area of the Mupu 
fire and no more than 20 years old in the Shiells Canyon and South Mountain 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy employed in fighting the fires was another key element in averting 
a major catastrophe. In Ventura County, firefighters were able to take 
advantage of natural barriers and other topographical conditions that did not 
exist in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The planning for containment of the South Mountain fire began soon after the 
houses were secured by midnight Monday. The first decision the officers made 
was to wait until the morning instead of digging fire lines blindly in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn Tuesday, Bement called a meeting of his top officers to announce 
the plans for the rest of the day: The firefighters would attack the South 
Mountain blaze from the flanks and the rear in hopes of gradually shrinking it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you try to take on a fire like that by attacking the head, you'll get blown 
out," said Ventura County Fire Capt. Keith Gurrola, who was at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At daybreak, Gurrola and Wildlife Fire Officer Bill Wright were dispatched to 
study the burn and draw fire lines. In doing so, they took advantage of the 
opportunities the terrain presented to them. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, the fire was prevented from advancing by a three-tier barrier -- 
the asphalt of South Mountain Road, the moist vegetation of the Santa Clara 
River bed and a wide strip of heavily irrigated citrus orchards preserved as 
city greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
For the duration of the fire, farmers kept their water sprinklers turned on. 
</P>
<P>
Gurrola said Santa Paula was wise in planning a greenbelt around its city. 
"Whenever you have some kind of buffer like that, it acts as a firebreak." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the fire strategy at South Mountain was to secure the southern flank 
of the blaze. The object was to prevent the fire from going over the top of the 
mountain from the cooler, northern side to the mountain's sunbaked southern 
slope. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the mountain was peppered with Texaco Oil rigs and platforms, and 
several dirt roads leading to them provided the firefighters with all the 
access and firebreaks they needed to stop the fire from reaching the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were able to take advantage of the steep dirt roads because they 
were equipped with four-wheel-drive brush engines, which are smaller and more 
mobile than conventional fire engines. 
</P>
<P>
The wind, or lack of it, was another factor working against the South Mountain 
fire. Weather services had predicted 50 to 60 m.p.h. Santa Ana gusts for 
Tuesday, but only 20 to 30 m.p.h. winds materialized. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the South Mountain fire was encircled and under control, and fire 
experts turned their attention to the Mupu blaze. 
</P>
<P>
When the Mupu fire was detected on Tuesday morning, fire planners chose the 
opposite strategy than the one used to fight the South Mountain fire: They 
would attack the flames head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you're fighting a major fire and a second one breaks out, you plan an 
aggressive attack to catch it before it grows," said Capt. Wayne Maynard, who 
acted as planning officer for the fires. 
</P>
<P>
By diverting personnel to the Mupu fire from the almost-contained South 
Mountain fire, firefighters were able to move fast enough to bulldoze fire 
lines at the bottom of a ridge near California 150. 
</P>
<P>
Their speed put them in position to take on the blaze when it was still no more 
than a 30-acre fire. But just as the firefighters began their attack, the winds 
picked up and the flames jumped the fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters regrouped and drew a second line of defense at the bottom of Adams 
Canyon. As firefighters prepared to take on the Mupu blaze for a second time, 
aerial tankers took advantage of the relatively plain terrain around the area 
to bombard it with fire retardant. At the same time, ground crews closed in on 
the fire from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
The weather changed again in favor of the firefighters: Just as the fire 
approached the canyon, the winds began to die. As the flames reached the fire 
line, the winds were blowing at less than 10 m.p.h. in the canyon area and the 
air cooled off, said Fire Behavior Officer Doug Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fortunate turn of events," Campbell said. "All the factors worked in 
favor of our ability to gain control." 
</P>
<P>
Before sundown, the Mupu fire was also nearly contained. But by then, the winds 
had picked up again and the Shiells Canyon fire in Fillmore was threatening to 
burn down a row of single-family houses on Guiberson Road. 
</P>
<P>
The Shiells Canyon fire and the South Mountain fire were similar in many 
respects: Both were wind-aided ridge fires spreading quickly from east to west; 
both had roads and wet orchards blocking their spread to the north; both had 
oil company mountain roads providing firefighters with access to the south and 
both were threatening houses at the foot of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, fire experts used essentially the same plan to fight the 
Shiells Canyon blaze that had worked at South Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, fire officials concentrated all their initial efforts on saving the 
houses. Already in the area in full strength, they had five 15-engine strike 
teams at Shiells Canyon in 20 minutes, said Ventura County Fire Department 
spokeswoman Shonna Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a break there," Perry said. "In most cases, you may be able to get one 
or two strike teams right away but never five." 
</P>
<P>
Among the first units to arrive were two strike teams from the city of Los 
Angeles and they were especially helpful, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are structure fire strike teams and are especially trained and equipped 
to protect structures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After first securing about 15 houses in the Shiells Canyon area, firefighters 
again worked their way around the blaze, slowly bringing it under control. By 
dawn on Wednesday, the last of the three fires had been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of accomplishment in fighting fires like these," said one of 
the firefighters. "It's a good feeling. Makes you feel like you've completed 
something."

MORTICIAN TO BE TRIED FOR MURDER; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY DAVID WAYNE SCONCE POISONED A RIVAL WITH OLEANDER. A 
JUDGE DENIES AN ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE CASE TO LOS ANGELES. 
</P>

<P>
A Ventura County Municipal Court judge on Wednesday ordered a murder trial for 
David Wayne Sconce, the former Pasadena undertaker accused of poisoning rival 
mortician Timothy Waters with oleander in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Waters died April 8, 1985, in his parents' home in Camarillo 
after suffering a bout of nausea and diarrhea on Easter weekend, according to 
witnesses' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have alleged that Sconce, now 34, spiked Waters' drink with 
oleander at an unnamed restaurant. But they admitted Wednesday that they have 
no proof the men saw each other about the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that admission and new testimony that the grossly overweight Waters was 
already dying of an overworked heart, flabby liver and fluid-filled lungs, 
Judge John J. Hunter ordered Sconce to be arraigned in Superior Court on Oct. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Holloway, the former assistant Ventura County coroner who conducted an 
autopsy on Waters' body in 1985, testified Wednesday that Waters' weight of 
more than 270 pounds had weakened his organs, making him "more susceptible to 
what for others would be a nontoxic amount of oleander." 
</P>
<P>
Holloway's testimony and the order for a trial came less than a week after 
Sconce finished a prison term for charges surrounding the illegal operation of 
his family's Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena. Sconce was jailed for pleading 
guilty in 1989 to charges that he conducted mass cremations and sold gold teeth 
he took from bodies, and that he paid two men to beat Waters for spreading word 
of the violations among Los Angeles County undertakers. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce killed Waters to silence him, argued Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss, one 
of the Los Angeles County prosecutors assigned to the case because of their 
familiarity with Sconce's criminal record. Sconce also bragged about the 
killing to two men he once hired to beat up Waters and another rival, Giss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The conduct at the Lamb Funeral Home "was beyond unethical and beyond 
irreligious," Giss said during a closing argument that capped the 6 1/2-day 
preliminary hearing. "The defendant had a guilty mind. People knew his secrets. 
He feared very much being found out." 
</P>
<P>
Giss cited testimony by Daniel Galambos and David Edwards, who said Sconce paid 
them to beat Waters and another rival in late 1984 and early 1985. The two 
testified that Sconce bragged that he killed Waters by slipping poison into his 
drink during a meal. 
</P>
<P>
And Giss recalled Sconce's own admission to police that he had read "The Poor 
Man's James Bond," a 1972 book describing homemade weapons and hard-to-detect 
poisons such as oleander. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is very powerful and overwhelming circumstantial evidence," Giss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But court-appointed defense attorney Roger J. Diamond told the court that 
Galambos and Edwards got reduced sentences in the beatings in exchange for 
testifying against Sconce. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is this: There is not one witness who can place Mr. Sconce 
with Mr. Waters at any critical time prior to Mr. Waters' demise," Diamond 
said, pleading for Sconce's release. "It's such a gigantic hole that I believe 
it would be an abuse of discretion of this court to hold him to answer on the 
state of this evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said, "I find that Timothy Waters, who appears to have been a dying man, 
was poisoned by oleander, and that is the cause of death in this case and the 
death was a homicide, and statements made by the defendant are sufficient to 
give this court reason to believe he is guilty of this crime. The defendant is 
held to answer." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter denied a motion by Diamond to move the trial to Los Angeles. Diamond 
argued that the victim, defendant and witnesses all come from there. 
</P>
<P>
Waters' mother, Mary Lou Waters, testified Wednesday that she would not try to 
stop Diamond from having her son's body exhumed for more toxicology tests.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
DISTRICT C CANDIDATES POLLS APART ON CLASSROOM POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The contest between John de Beck and Scott Harvey for the District C city 
school board seat offers perhaps the strongest contrast among candidates' 
positions in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck promises to revamp the educational agenda -- or at least the debating 
agenda -- at the school board if he can repeat his primary victory over Harvey 
for the Point Loma-Mission Hills trustee spot in the general election next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck, just retired at age 60 after 36 years as a San Diego teacher, opposes 
the watershed common-core curriculum intended to give every secondary student 
in the city schools a college-preparatory schedule in math, English, science 
and social studies. 
</P>
<P>
He opposes the district's decade-old integration program of busing and special 
magnet programs. He argues against school-based health clinics and against 
holding teachers more responsible for the failure of almost one out of five 
city students, most of them Latino and black, to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
In short, De Beck stands in opposition to almost every major initiative 
undertaken by city schools trustees and Supt. Tom Payzant during the past 
several years, especially those intended to cope with an increasingly 
multiethnic student population. 
</P>
<P>
Yet De Beck, with the strong backing of the San Diego Teachers Assn. -- and its 
political contributions of more than $15,000 in the primary alone -- stands as 
the favorite against opponent Harvey, whom he trounced in the primary by a 
61.1% to 26.5% margin. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, a lobbyist and former director of intergovernmental affairs for the 
city of San Diego, is banking on revulsion from voters, and in particular from 
teachers themselves, to put him into contention as they learn the details of De 
Beck's platform. 
</P>
<P>
Already Harvey has garnered the support of all five current trustees and has 
set up a Teachers for Harvey group to counteract the image that official labor 
union support will automatically translate into thousands of votes of 
individual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
While not dismissing De Beck's performance in the primary, open only to 
District C voters, Harvey believes that he has a realistic shot in the citywide 
general, particularly if voters pay more attention to what Harvey says are 
clearly defined differences between the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey strongly backs present educational reform policies which have put the 
San Diego district -- the nation's eighth-largest urban system with 121,200 
students -- on the leading edge of national reform although they have not yet 
resulted in significant improvements in student academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey also doubts that De Beck can fairly judge teacher-district issues given 
his many years as a supporter of, and contract bargainer with, the teachers' 
association. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck is banking on the hope that neither a majority of San Diego teachers 
nor the public-at-large buy the numerous reforms being spearheaded by Payzant, 
but instead want a return to traditional discipline and teaching, an 
acknowledgement that not all students can or will go to college. 
</P>
<P>
"With all my years in education, I'm cynical about school change," says De 
Beck, a self-described "practical iconoclast." He added, "I'm not so eager to 
grab onto new ideas" as other educators, including leaders of the teachers' 
association. He even wonders whether the union knows of the many positions he 
might take that run counter to its official support of district reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'd rather go down swinging than change my philosophy," said De Beck, who 
ran against board President Kay Davis four years ago and was drubbed. Davis is 
not running for a third term, leaving a open seat. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck has made opposition to the common-core curriculum program a major tenet 
of his campaign. Indeed, he spoke forcefully against the proposal to trustees 
when it was first floated in 1988, based on his experience as a business 
education teacher at Garfield High School, an alternative school for students 
close to dropping out or for those who already left school at least once. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has proven that single-track education works because it doesn't," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck said the program, by requiring all students to study 
college-preparatory academics, will cause more dropouts among students who see 
no relevance in some or all of the subjects, or who lack the ability to tackle 
more advanced English or math. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patently false to say that all kids can succeed in a college-prep 
curriculum because not even the colleges believe that," De Beck said. "We're so 
eager to appear to be producing excellence that we're just eliminating courses 
for those kids who are not college-bound and who want vocational courses or 
other choices. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to a kid's heart is relevance . . . not everyone needs to know 
algebra. They need to know symbols, to be able to manipulate numbers. And that 
can be taught a lot of different ways, not just the one prescribed way the 
district wants to force on us." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, De Beck scoffs at the district's new elementary reading 
program, which eliminates rigid ability groupings and limited-word textbooks in 
favor of unaltered children's literature, a greater emphasis on writing, and 
temporary groupings of students based on need for specific work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not politically right to talk about this, but teachers will end up 
grouping (permanently) anyways, because you can't teach reading any other way, 
given class sizes and differences between the level of kids," De Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck also criticized district emphasis on cooperative learning -- as part of 
its ethnic equity policies -- where children are often grouped without regard 
to ability in expectation that they can learn from each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't work the way the district says it does because it takes real 
close monitoring by teachers to see that it is working, and it is much harder 
to oversee than groups based on ability." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, De Beck calls the entire district emphasis on integration wrongheaded. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole concept of racial pride has been defeated by integration," he said, 
referring to the longstanding district plan for voluntary busing of nonwhite 
students to predominantly white schools and establishment of special magnet 
curriculums in nonwhite schools to attract white students to those Latino and 
black majority sites. 
</P>
<P>
"Strong neighborhood schools (in minority areas) have been defeated by allowing 
kids to be bused across town," he said. De Beck prefers to put less money into 
integration and more into trying to improve achievement at nonwhite schools. 
"For me, achievement is much more important than integration . . . integration 
is a social aspect, a function of society, not schools." 
</P>
<P>
While De Beck backs the district concept for giving individual schools more say 
over their budgets and curriculum -- the so-called "restructuring" process -- 
he recoils at efforts to strengthen accountability of teachers by tightening 
evaluation procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's faulty reasoning to focus evaluation on teachers, and not on learners," 
De Beck said. "The learner is responsible for his or her learning. The school 
is responsible to provide the environment for learning. But even a mediocre 
teacher can work with a student who is motivated . . . the belief that a school 
can make a person successful is not true." 
</P>
<P>
De Beck favors choice for students to attend any school within the public 
system and would provide transportation for those who could not afford it 
otherwise. He favors a woman's right to choose an abortion, but opposes health 
clinics in schools to distribute information about birth control, saying that 
school-based clinics "would interfere with family values." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not just locate them right across the street from schools, and refer 
students there after considering religion, family, and other values first?" he 
proposes. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey is taking every opportunity to stress his differences from De Beck. His 
campaign has prepared thousands of index-size cards to distribute to households 
delineating their contrasting views on health centers and the core curriculum, 
among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the most pressing issue in this campaign is to continue working 
for multicultural diversity," said Harvey, 45, whose wife teaches at Grant 
Elementary in Mission Hills and whose father is principal of Glendale High 
School near Los Angeles. (The San Diego district is now 62% nonwhite and 38% 
white.) 
</P>
<P>
"It follows then that we need more social services for our students, that we 
need a more ethnically sensitive curriculum, that we need to give elementary 
children more self-confidence and self-esteem so they will read by the third 
grade -- all of these programs are vitally important to the future," Harvey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And when my opponent criticizes the common core, he's really asking us to go 
back to the old approach, the system we used to have that has failed so many of 
our students. The common core demands high expectations for students and says 
that all students can learn, and I truly believe that such beliefs are 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said that the experiences of his wife and father have taught him that 
"tracking can hurt kids" and that "there are intangible benefits to blending 
students who don't have the same backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
As a lobbyist, Harvey has fought with the school district for easier rules to 
permit nonprofit child-care operators to have facilities at schools in order to 
make access easier for harried parents. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, he would also push for more funds for preschool education, 
including the expansion of programs such as Head Start, he said. While not 
promising to find extra funds, Harvey believes his background as a city 
lobbyist in Sacramento and Washington could prove useful in identifying 
additional money for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey supports school-based clinics, such as one proposed for Hoover High 
School, as long as parents are involved in the planning and financing comes 
from non-school sources such as health foundations. 
</P>
<P>
He would leave the controversial issue of birth-control information up to 
individual schools as part of restructuring to give parents and teachers more 
decision-making authority. 
</P>
<P>
And Harvey continues to hit hard at De Beck's past work as a member of the 
teachers' union bargaining committee, arguing that De Beck would be 
hard-pressed to be an independent voice when salary and benefit issues are 
debated during contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying I would work to undo anything in the present (labor) laws," 
Harvey said. "But I would be able to be a neutral party and retain independent 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey also is irritated that there has not been more focus on his campaign and 
that voters in the primary showed little or no hesitation in voting for a 
teacher as a trustee. To counter the large number of volunteers that De Beck 
has tapped through the teachers' union, Harvey has amassed an eclectic group of 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Developers Tom Carter and Pat Kruer, present school board trustee Susan Davis, 
City Councilman Wes Pratt, Latino activist Rachel Ortiz and Democratic Party 
activist and Community College District trustee Evonne Schulze have distributed 
a joint letter to thousands of San Diego Democrats asking them to vote for 
Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that I've got a good chance still," Harvey said. "I ask people to vote 
for me as a progressive." 
</P>
<P>
"Win or lose," De Beck said, "at least I've gotten people to pay attention to 
my views this time."

A routine traffic stop Wednesday of a bicycle rider who was seen driving 
erratically by a San Diego police officer led to the driver's arrest for 
various narcotics violations. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, Officer John Hausotter was patrolling at 6:45 
p.m. in the 4500 block of Wightman Street in East San Diego when he observed 
Jose Padilla, 25, pedaling his bicycle in an erratic manner and violating 
several traffic laws. 
</P>
<P>
Hausotter pulled the man over and searched him. Police said that Padilla was 
allegedly carrying marijuana in one of his pockets and carried four bricks of 
marijuana, weighing a total of about 4 pounds, in his backpack. The officer 
seized the drugs and $407 in cash that Padilla was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla was arrested and charged with possessing marijuana and transporting 
marijuana for the purposes of selling. Police also learned that he was wanted 
on an outstanding narcotics warrant, a police spokesman said.

About 300 Seabees flew from Point Mugu Wednesday morning to join 350 other 
county-based personnel now in Saudi Arabia. Another 900 men based in Port 
Hueneme are expected to join troops in the Middle East within the next month, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seabees are a uniformed force of civil engineers and construction 
tradesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's 11 a.m. flight completed the deployment of 650 men from Naval 
Mobile Construction Battalion 5, which started Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Two other battalions based in Port Hueneme have orders to support Operation 
Desert Shield, said Kassie Gale, a spokeswoman for the Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 men of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4, now deployed in Puerto 
Rico, have flown to Saudi Arabia. And Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 40, 
now in Guam, will also be redeployed. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing holding them back at this point is the availability of 
aircraft," Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth battalion based in Port Hueneme has not yet received orders to 
depart for Saudi Arabia, Gale said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 6, a cargo ship left Port Hueneme with 200 pieces of heavy 
construction equipment for the Seabees. Other equipment has been deployed from 
Guam, Gale said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

Robert Livingston, who has served as Santa Paula's administrator and city 
manager for the past four years, is resigning and will move to University Park, 
Tex., in January, according to Mayor Kay Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good professional move for me, although we've enjoyed our time here," 
said Livingston, who will assume duties as administrator of the city, which is 
near Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I view it as a personal loss for the city. Bob has brought many special 
talents to us. We hate to lose him, but we wish him nothing but the best," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Eckert, assistant to Livingston, characterized his supervisor's style of 
management as open and approachable. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can find someone as excellent as Bob," Eckert said. 
</P>
<P>
Recruitment for the position, which pays about $68,000 annually depending on 
experience, will begin later this month and last through November. The City 
Council hopes to appoint a new manager by mid- to late December, Eckert said.

SCHOOL INSURER SUES ALLEGED ARSONIST

<P>
The insurance company that covers Hueneme High School has filed a lawsuit 
against a teen-ager who allegedly started a Nov. 4 fire that caused more than 
$169,000 in damage at the Oxnard campus. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial Indemnity Co. filed the suit Tuesday in Ventura County Superior 
Court against Tyrone Miller and his parents, Lewis and Evelyn Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Police have declined to identify the three youths who allegedly set the fire 
because of their ages at the time of the incident. One Oxnard student, now 18, 
was sentenced to seven years and eight months in the California Youth 
Authority. A 14-year-old who acted as a lookout during the arson and a 
16-year-old who kicked in a window to let the arsonist inside were found guilty 
of burglary in Juvenile Court and expelled from Hueneme High School. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that Miller set the fire that damaged the school and that his 
parents are legally responsible for his acts. 
</P>
<P>
None of the Millers could be reached for comment Wednesday. MACK REED

COUNTY COULD HAVE RESTRICTED DRILLING

A well-drilling operation in the Ventura River would not have been allowed to 
run day and night if county officials had realized the noise was going to carry 
throughout Meiners Oaks, an official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lesson to us," said John Crowley, senior hydrologist with Ventura 
County Water Resources Department. 
</P>
<P>
"When a well-drilling permit is issued in a city or urban area, we usually 
condition it to operate within certain hours," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
"With this one, we thought the nearest residence was three-quarters of a mile 
away. We didn't anticipate any problem." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the river channel amplified the sound like a drum, Crowley said, as 
the large rotary rig drilled around the clock since last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rotary drills usually operate 24 hours a day to prevent cave-ins, he said, but 
the operator, Midway Drilling,could have been asked to stop work at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, after the holiday weekend, a local water company received more than 
a dozen complaints, while the Sheriff's Department told residents that its 
hands were tied because the county permit did not restrict operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We issue 300 permits a year and get a complaint of noise about once every five 
years," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Drilling the 200-foot-deep well for Farmont Corp. to irrigate citrus groves and 
water cattle also took longer than expected due to the number of boulders in 
the dry, rocky riverbed, Crowley said. THIA BELL

FIRE MENACES BUT SPARES NAVY HOMES IN TIERRASANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A fast-moving brush fire briefly threatened a Navy housing complex in 
Tierrasanta Wednesday before San Diego firefighters brought the blaze under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials reported no injuries or structures damaged in the blaze, which 
burned between 8 and 10 acres near Balboa Avenue and Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents said the fire began about 3:15 p.m., and the Fire Department 
reported it under control 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi O'Brien, who operates a day-care center at her home, said her home and 
others in the complex were saved because last Friday the Navy finished clearing 
a 6-foot-wide area of brush around the houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We were real lucky. Believe me, if it wasn't for the Navy clearing the area, 
some of our homes would've burned," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire came right up to the edge of the cleared area, but never made it 
beyond our back fence. We have a tree in our back yard that has branches 
leaning over the area and it got singed." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the fire burned so hot on the dry brush that the heat melted 
some plastic toys that were lying under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire was spotted, O'Brien said, she joined other neighbors in hosing 
down the dry brush beyond the fire clearing. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, a 300-foot plume of red smoke puffed in the air," she said. 
"You could feel the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped the hose and went inside the house to pick up the kids. We all ran 
into the street, where we stayed until the fire trucks arrived and the firemen 
told us to stay back." 
</P>
<P>
A Fire Department spokeswoman said the cause of the fire is under 
investigation.

POLICE PANEL PONDERS DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: RANDOM DRUG TESTING OF OFFICERS, CLOSER SCRUTINY OF NEW HIRES 
ARE BEING CONSIDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A San Diego Police Department ethics board may recommend department-wide random 
drug testing, a special anti-corruption unit to deal with potential abuses 
among officers, and more extensive scrutiny of new hires, an ethics committee 
member said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the department's second-in-command is conducting a police 
management audit that is designed to test whether the department's policies are 
being carried out and whether its organizational structure is sound. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics review, considered the most extensive in department history, began 
in February when top administrators decided that police officers were not 
getting any ethics training once they graduated from the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dennis Gibson, a member of the 20-person committee, told a citizen's 
advisory board that studies police issues that his group is expecting to 
forward a number of recommendations to Police Chief Bob Burgreen in the next 
four or five months. 
</P>
<P>
One of those recommendations may include mandatory random drug testing for all 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The department put a program into place last month to test about 150 officers 
who work in highly sensitive units, such as internal affairs, narcotics, 
criminal intelligence, gangs and vice. Gibson said 26 tests have been performed 
so far, and nobody has tested positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and South Lake Tahoe are the only departments to impose such 
mandatory tests, which the president of the state's largest law-enforcement 
association -- the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California -- opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Now the committee is considering whether to randomly test all 1,850 police 
officers. It would cost the department about $220,000 a year to test each 
employee twice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department may establish a special corruption unit whose 
investigators would handle sensitive police misconduct cases, Gibson said. Such 
investigations now are handled by the police internal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said few departments in the country have corruption units and the San 
Diego Police Department is wary of establishing one because of the public 
perception that to create one is to admit that corruption exists. 
</P>
<P>
Senior officers, from Burgreen on down, say their department is now 
corruption-free despite allegations that police officers may have had improper 
contact with prostitutes in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen recently suggested that the ethics committee establish guidelines that 
discourage officers from getting personally involved with prostitutes after 
allegations surfaced that at least five police officers and one former officer 
may have had such improper involvement. 
</P>
<P>
A special unit of the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force -- the group of 
investigators examining the deaths of 43 women, mostly prostitutes and 
transients, since 1985 -- is looking at allegations that police officers may 
have had relationships with one of the murdered women and another prostitute 
who has been missing for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the department believe that not enough is being done to test 
for possible corruption, such as carefully auditing money in narcotics cases or 
inspecting crime scenes to see if officers follow proper procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said that if the committee does not recommend creation of a special 
corruption unit, it may advise Burgreen to expand the internal affairs staff. 
</P>
<P>
It may also recommend that greater scrutiny be placed on new hires, including 
the expansion of screening committees that decide who gets hired and asking 
personnel administrators to personally visit recruits' job references. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee feels strongly that if we are concerned about honesty, integrity 
and credibility of police officers, we need to start at the ground floor and 
ensure to the extent possible that we attract only the most qualified and 
ethical people that we can," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also is considering whether to rotate officers out of specialized 
assignments such as narcotics enforcement, criminal intelligence, vice and 
gangs to keep the units corruption-free. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said San Diego police are not alone in their lack of ethics training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"A national survey we did indicated we're not different from a lot of 
departments," he said. "There's just not much being done in the area of ethics 
awareness or training." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Norm Stamper said he has been assigned to study the 
department's organizational structure. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen had assigned Stamper to personally review the prostitute murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper recommended that the task force membership be nearly doubled and 
divided into three areas: one team to examine all the murder victims; another 
to scrutinize possible police misconduct, and the third to investigate the 
death of prostitute Donna Gentile, who was murdered in 1985 shortly after she 
testified against two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said Wednesday his work with the task force has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
He said Burgreen is concerned that police policies are not being carried out 
because there are seven levels of management between the police chief and the 
patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of such a long chain of command, Stamper said, Burgreen's messages 
about what he wants done in the department may not be filtering down. 
</P>
<P>
"My first job is an audit of the organization," he said. "What is the extent to 
which the chief's philosophies and policies are translated into practice? The 
second part of the assignment is: Are we organized effectively to get police 
work done?" 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said he will also be sitting in on ethics committee meetings and on 
those of a separate police group looking at the department's use of deadly 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that the chief would like to see a much stronger community 
orientation," Stamper said. "The bywords of his administration are dignity and 
respect. He wants citizens treated with dignity and respect and wants to 
communicate that message to the officers."

COUNTY, L.A. TO SOLICIT PRIVATE TRANSIT PROJECTS REJECTED BY STATE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS EXPECT THE LAX-PALMDALE LEVITATION RAIL TO BE AMONG 
THE PROPOSALS. THE PRIVATIZATION PLAN MAY REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Spurned by the state in a recent competition to select privately built 
transportation projects, Los Angeles city and county officials Wednesday 
announced their own program under which firms will be invited to build toll 
highways and rail projects on public land. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which might require approval by the Legislature, is patterned 
after one launched last month by Caltrans under which four toll roads were 
chosen for state approval from eight projects submitted by private bidders. 
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of Los Angeles officials, the state transportation agency passed 
over the lone Los Angeles County entry -- a $1.3-billion magnetic levitation 
rail line from Los Angeles International Airport to Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Local transit officials said they hoped that the consortium which proposed the 
futuristic train -- which would be built on pillars in the right of way of the 
San Diego, Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways -- also will enter the 
project in the county's privatization program. 
</P>
<P>
Another project that officials expect to see proposed by private firms is an 
elevated monorail along the Ventura Freeway in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the most likely two," said Nikolas Patsaouras, president of the 
Rapid Transit District board of directors, "but we want projects from 
throughout the county. We want to see what the private sector comes up with." 
</P>
<P>
Although the county privatization program has not yet been discussed by the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission, which would administer it, Neil 
Peterson, commission executive director, predicted "very strong -- probably 
unanimous -- support." 
</P>
<P>
Inviting private firms to build transportation projects on public land is an 
idea that has caught on quickly among California officials searching for ways 
to meet the demand for traffic relief with scarce public funds. 
</P>
<P>
And support comes from all points on the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
The program was endorsed Wednesday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, 
Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Ed Edelman, the RTD's Patsaouras and 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who chairs the Assembly Transportation 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Our transportation needs are greater than the public resources available to 
address them," said Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
An unresolved question is whether state legislation is required before Caltrans 
can allow private transportation projects to use freeway land. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Baxter, Caltrans Southern California district director, said Wednesday he 
thinks it is, but he added, "I can't imagine why we would not support such 
legislation if it's a project that improves transportation. That's what we're 
here for." 
</P>
<P>
The "maglev" line was proposed by a consortium formed by the 
Massachusetts-based Perini Corp., the Los Angeles engineering firm of Daniel, 
Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall and the HSST Corp. of Japan.

ROLLING HILLS ESTATES TELLS RECYCLE CENTER TO MOVE OUT BY MAY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE CENTER IS A FAVORITE OF PALOS VERDES PENINSULA RESIDENTS, 
EXCEPT FOR ITS CLOSEST NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Rolling Hills Estates City Council gave notice this week to the Palos 
Verdes Recycle Center that it has until May 1 to move or it will be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-1 vote was taken Tuesday after more than an hour of testimony at a public 
hearing, during which some residents extolled the virtues of the center, while 
others living near it complained of the noise and dust it creates. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said an extension of the deadline is possible, but only if the 
center makes progress in finding an alternative site in the city where it will 
not disturb its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
John Gulledge, an official with the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts 
that operates the center, said after the hearing, "It would be extremely 
difficult to move the facility in six months," but he would work toward that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the center is providing a valuable service to the community," Gulledge 
said, adding that the sanitation districts agency does not have the money to 
move the center, which operates at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Kenneth Servis voted against closing the facility, saying he didn't 
think six months gave the sanitation districts enough time to find another 
site. "It's really too short a fuse," he said. "I don't think six months is 
realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Warren Schwarzmann said he didn't want to see the popular center shut 
down because "to close a recycling center at this point is kind of backwards." 
Nevertheless, he said he was voting to close the center within six months "to 
get some urgency" in efforts to move it. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we can have such a plan in six months is certainly a question in my 
mind," Schwarzmann added. 
</P>
<P>
He and other council members indicated a willingness to extend the deadline, if 
substantial progress has been made to move the center. Schwarzmann said the 
city's staff would attempt to find outside funds to move the center away from 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Jacki McGuire was not present for the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The center has been at its site north of City Hall for 20 years, and was 
originally established as a temporary recycling facility to raise money for 
various charities. Although the sanitation agency owns the property where it is 
located, it must have a city conditional-use permit to operate the center 
because the land is zoned for agricultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the center has become popular with residents of the four 
peninsula cities, as well as those from other neighboring communities as a 
place that buys recyclable materials such as bottles, aluminum cans, newspapers 
and motor oil. About 80 charities now benefit when recyclers take in materials 
and assign sale proceeds to the charities. 
</P>
<P>
Residents from Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills sent letters to council 
members urging them to keep the center open. In Rolling Hills, many residents 
rely on the center because the city does not yet have a curbside recycling 
program. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors whose back yards abut the facility have complained about noise 
and dust for years. And, although many told council members that some problems 
had been corrected, the crash of broken glass and clanging of aluminum cans is 
still a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"We residents have had enough of it," Vince DiFiore said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had it in our back yard for 20 years," said Norman Unis, president of 
the Roanwood Homeowners Assn. "On the (peninsula) there must be some open space 
where you can put it, but I don't think you're going to have any takers." 
</P>
<P>
One possible site for the center discussed at Tuesday's meeting is an abandoned 
power plant north of the city's municipal stables. The property is part of the 
same former landfill on which the recycling center already sits.

TEACHERS' FLIGHTS OF FANCY QUALIFY THEM FOR WORLD MODEL PLANE EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Leuzinger High School teachers are going to the Olympics in Yugoslavia next 
July -- but not the games that glue sports fans to their television sets every 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion is the Federation Aeronautique Internationale's Free Flight World 
Championship, the highest-level of competition for free-flight model pilots. 
</P>
<P>
For Leuzinger's Bob Isaacson, 55, chairman of the physical education 
department, and Norm Furutani, 44, head of the fine and performing arts 
department, winning spots on the nine-member U.S. team was the ultimate reward 
for years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's fantastic," Furutani said. "It's like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Styles of the Academy of Model Aeronautics in Reston, Va., described 
the championships as "the pinnacle for people who fly in this category, the Mt. 
Everest of free flight." 
</P>
<P>
"This is it. You can't get any higher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike remote-control forms of the sport, free-flight aviation consists of 
model pilots relinquishing all control over the craft once it is launched. 
Free-flight modeling is the oldest form of the sport, and free-flight pilots 
are considered the purists of model aviation. The first world championship for 
free-flight aviation was in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Flight World Championship, often called the Olympics of free flight by 
enthusiasts, takes place every two years and is expected to draw teams from 
more than 30 nations. Trophies are awarded in three classes of free-flight 
aviation: gliders, rubber-powered models and engine-driven planes. Regardless 
of the class, the object of the sport is the same: to keep the miniature planes 
in the air for at least three minutes, a task that requires not only good 
craftsmanship but also a knowledge of air currents. 
</P>
<P>
In a competition last month in Lost Hills, Calif., that drew about 100 model 
aviators from around the nation, Isaacson and Furutani won "fly-offs" in their 
categories to make the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson, who flies gliders, competed in one other world championship, in 1975. 
He qualified for the current team last month by posting a perfect score in 13 
three-minute flights. 
</P>
<P>
Furutani, who flies rubber-powered models and has never competed in a world 
championship, was one of four pilots who posted a perfect score in 12 
three-minute fly-offs. He made the team after finishing among the top three in 
a final four-minute fly-off. 
</P>
<P>
Gliders are lofted into the air like kites at the end of a 50-meter-long 
string. Pilots then disengage the string to set the plane free. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber-powered models are thrown into the air like a javelin. Before launching, 
the pilot must twist large rubber bands with a winding device to spin the 
propeller after the plane is airborne. 
</P>
<P>
With engine-driven models the motors are used only to get the planes into the 
air. Pilots can either throw the plane like a javelin or launch it directly 
from the ground, a method that earns extra points. 
</P>
<P>
In all three techniques, finding a rising air bubble in which to launch the 
plane is a key. Whereas glider pilots can feel air currents on the end of the 
string, rubber-model and engine-driven pilots blow soap bubbles or set up 
banners to test the wind. 
</P>
<P>
The planes are all equipped with timers that trigger the tail to flip down when 
it is time to descend. They are usually programmed to circle a field, but are 
often fitted with tracking devices in case an air current takes them off 
course. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 11 years since members of a U.S. team took home a trophy from the 
world championship. One of the difficulties, model pilots say, is that the 
sport isn't taken very seriously in this country. Although model aviation is 
regarded as a professional sport in many countries, it has never enjoyed the 
same prestige in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Open flying fields in urban areas of the United States are getting harder to 
find, and complaints about noise and occasional incidents -- like one in Carson 
Sept. 30 in which a radio-controlled model plane punctured a Goodyear blimp -- 
have tarnished the sport's image. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas American model aviators are regarded as hobbyists, their European and 
Soviet counterparts are treated "just like they were professional athletes," 
Styles said. And Eastern European modelers historically have received salaries, 
housing, training and coaches, but American model pilots "have to fit it in 
between going to work, feeding the baby, paying the mortgage and all that 
stuff," Styles said. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson and Furutani both grew up in Gardena and attended Gardena High School, 
but they did not meet until six years ago when Furutani started teaching at 
Leuzinger. Both had been flying model airplanes since they were boys and each 
had fantasized about being airline pilots before deciding to pursue careers in 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
A former USC football fullback, Isaacson said he became serious about model 
aviation in 1972 when he entered his first competition. Furutani, whose father 
was a model aviator, said it never occurred to him to fly competitively until 
he met Isaacson six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both men said they never tire of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy seeing (the planes) up in the air," Furutani said. "It's an extension 
of yourself when you fly these things. It's like an escape." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson agreed: "If you see 10 of them in the air at the same time, it's 
incredibly graceful. It's a beautiful thing to see." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Isaacson and Furutani have a network of friends around the world who are 
model aviators. The Leuzinger teachers, who schedule their lunches and free 
periods together to work on their planes, devote about 30 hours a week to the 
sport. They usually meet on weekends at a flying field in Lost Hills to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
They also sponsor their high school's Air Model Club. Because the sport 
requires a high level of patience, technical skill and a knowledge of 
aerodynamics, they aren't always successful in attracting students. This year, 
in fact, only one student signed up for the club. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to compete with video games and things that kids get into nowadays," 
Furutani said. "It can be frustrating because you can't fly them right away." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the world competition, Isaacson and Furutani have begun 
constructing new versions of the balsa-wood birds that won them spots on the 
U.S. team. Isaacson's model will be similar to the one he's been flying for the 
past 11 years, but it will contain a few structural improvements. Furutani's 
new plane will undergo some design improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Because glider pilots sometimes have to run with their planes for up to 30 
minutes in search of a rising air bubble before launching, Isaacson's training 
for the world championship also includes a bicycle-riding regimen of 150 miles 
per week. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the serious competitors who fly gliders do a great deal of 
cardiovascular work," Isaacson said. "In the other two classes (of free-flight 
aviation) it's not a physically demanding sport." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson, whose "Wishbone" and "RI-14" models have won two design awards, is 
"probably one of the best craftsmen around," Furutani said. "His building is 
real meticulous, more than anyone I've ever seen in neatness and exactness and 
the way the joints come together. His workmanship is just very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson also has praise for Furutani, who he says "learned to pick air (for 
launching) overnight. He has an aptitude for this stuff!" 
</P>
<P>
Although neither of their wives participates actively in the sport, both wives 
said they have grown to appreciate their husbands' accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I know where he is every night. He's not out getting into trouble," 
said Furutani's wife, Ginny. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson's wife, LaVera, who also works as a teacher at Leuzinger High, agreed: 
"Many people say 'How can you stand it? He's always busy.' But to me, everybody 
needs something they enjoy to get his mind off work." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she added, his triumphs in air modeling mean, "I get to go to Europe."

PLAN TO EXPAND PORTS MEETS WITH PUBLIC CRITICISM; 
</P>
<P>
HARBOR AREA: ABOUT 150 PEOPLE, MOST VOICING OPPOSITION, CROWDED A HEARING ABOUT 
$4.8-BILLION EXPANSION OF L.A. AND LONG BEACH PORTS BY 2020. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Harbor-area residents packed a public hearing this week to strongly criticize 
the proposed $4.8-billion expansion of Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, 
fearing the project's environmental consequences would outweigh its economic 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But the community concerns over air quality, traffic, marine life and other 
issues were not shared by local politicians and port businesses, who touted the 
so-called 2020 project as a model to accommodate the inevitable growth of the 
harbors -- already the nation's busiest. 
</P>
<P>
In the first and only hearing on the project's massive environmental report, 
about 150 people met Tuesday night at the Los Angeles Harbor Department's 
headquarters in San Pedro. And although the two dozen speakers addressing the 
report were almost evenly split among supporters and opponents of the project, 
the standing-room-only crowd was clearly behind the project's opponents, 
interrupting several times with applause. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the necessity for growth and development but we are doing it here 
for reasons that don't make any sense to me or my quality of life," said Larry 
Roteman, an electrical contractor from San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Added Tony Kay of the Wilmington Home Owners: "The conclusion seems to be 
(that) if it is economically beneficial for the ports, to hell with local 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour hearing was aimed at garnering public input on the project's 
recently released 8,000-page environmental report -- a study that details how 
the harbors would be dredged for shipping and to provide landfill to expand 
Terminal Island. The hearing was conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
which is expected to recommend that the federal government contribute $141 
million to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report, prepared by the ports and the corps of engineers, 
focuses on the project's first phase, a $3.5-billion undertaking that would add 
1,444 acres of landfill to Terminal Island and dredge the harbors for deeper 
channels. That work, the report concludes, would aggravate already poor air 
quality in the region, disrupt marine life in the harbors and adversely affect 
commercial fishing and public recreation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the report argues that the explosive growth in the ports' 
business demands some expansion of facilities. Otherwise, the report says, 
even-greater environmental problems could occur as the harbor becomes too 
crowded for shipping, forcing trains and trucks to carry the goods demanded by 
Southern California's ever-growing population and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The impacts "do not appear to outweigh the benefits of the project to the 
nation and the region," Col. Charles S. Thomas, the corps' district engineer, 
told the crowd Tuesday night in reviewing the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
The project and the report's findings were applauded by area politicians -- 
including Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San 
Pedro) -- as well as corporations doing business in the ports. 
</P>
<P>
Given the inevitability of growth in the harbors and the 2020 project's plans 
for meeting that growth, Richard Holdaway, president of Kaiser International 
Corp. told the hearing: "I can't believe anybody who lives in San Pedro would 
oppose this project." 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see the loss of 1,600 acres" of recreational waterways, said Martin 
Hochman of San Pedro, referring to the harbor waters that will be taken over by 
landfill and commercial ships. "The loss of that cannot be mitigated," Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Seaborne, who heads the Fisherman's Cooperative Assn. in San Pedro, said he 
was afraid that expansion of the ports would accommodate cargo ships at the 
expense of commercial fishing. 
</P>
<P>
And Ken Malloy, a Los Angeles city environmental commissioner, voiced concern 
that the project would destroy the foraging and breeding areas of the 
endangered California least tern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen the least tern come and go, mostly go," Malloy said, skeptical that 
the ports will successfully relocate the species to new habitats. "You just 
can't say to a tern, 'You are moving over here,' " Malloy said. 
</P>
<P>
Port clients and elected officials, however, countered that the 2020 project 
was a vital and adequately studied solution to nearly 20 years of federal and 
local discussion of expanding the ports. 
</P>
<P>
"The further growth of the Port of Los Angeles is vital to the continued 
dynamics of international trade between this country and others worldwide," 
Mayor Bradley said in a letter read at the hearing. "Certainly the demands for 
diversified goods and services by the Los Angeles area's 14 million residents 
today, as well as similar needs for an estimated 18 million by the year 2020, 
dictate that the port must prepare now for the next 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Rep. Anderson offered a prepared statement on the project that 
praised it as one that holds "enormous" economic importance for the region and 
the country. Today, he noted, the ports' trade and shipbuilding account for 
about 250,000 jobs in the region and contribute an estimated $25 billion to the 
area's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am keenly aware of environmental, transportation and other related problems 
that are associated with this project," Anderson said. "I am confident that all 
parties can continue to work together to mitigate these concerns prior to 
completion of the project." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, officials with the ports and the corps of engineers said 
they expect most of the environmental consequences of the ports' expansion to 
be minimized through the use of new technologies and other projects related to 
the 2020 plan. Those other projects include a new rail and truck corridor 
between the ports and downtown Los Angeles that would ease traffic elsewhere in 
the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
Further, officials argued that the 2020 project would improve safety in the 
ports and surrounding communities. The deeper channels, they said, would more 
safely accommodate today's larger vessels. And the expansion of Terminal 
Island, they added, would allow the relocation of hazardous fuel tanks now near 
Wilmington's residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the project's impacts could be offset, however. The loss of some 
recreational areas within the harbor, for example, would have an unavoidable 
impact on area residents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But overall, they argued, the 2020 project would provide the ports with the new 
land and terminals they need with minimal disruption to the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report will now be revised, with Tuesday's comments, for 
presentation to the federal government. Meanwhile, the project faces a series 
of reviews by state and local agencies, including the California Coastal 
Commission and the South Coast Air Quality Management District.

TREATING TIJUANA SEWAGE PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A COUNCIL COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED PUMPING MEXICAN SEWAGE THROUGH 
THE POINT LOMA TREATMENT PLANT TO HELP SOLVE AN ESCALATING HEALTH THREAT FROM 
SEWAGE FLOWING ACROSS THE BORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid warnings that Tijuana sewage poses escalating health threats here, a San 
Diego City Council committee endorsed a plan Wednesday calling for millions of 
gallons of Mexican sewage to be processed at the city's Point Loma treatment 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal approved by the council's Public Facilities and Recreation 
Committee, the city would install a pump near the international border and 
build a pipeline that would carry up to 14 million gallons of raw Mexican 
sewage daily to the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. The full council is 
scheduled to review that plan later this month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the estimated $3.5-million annual treatment cost -- an expense 
that city officials hope the federal government ultimately might pay -- another 
potential liability for San Diego in pursuing such a plan is that the Tijuana 
sewage could push the Point Loma plant close to its capacity. If that were to 
happen, city administrators warned, it could lead to a building moratorium in 
San Diego aimed at preventing additional strains on the local sewage-treatment 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Bob Filner, who proposed the temporary project to remedy what he 
referred to as "a disaster in the making," contended that the economic and 
feasibility questions could be satisfactorily resolved, adding that those 
factors should not be used as justification for "bureaucratic inertia." 
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. and Mexican governments plan to build a joint treatment plant 
in the mid-1990s to address the longstanding Tijuana sewage problem, San Diego 
cannot afford to wait that long, Filner stressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot wait until 1995 to solve this problem -- an immediate solution must 
be found," Filner said. "This requires a capital investment and ongoing 
operational costs, but these costs are minimal compared to the human costs that 
are currently being paid by area residents." 
</P>
<P>
No estimate was given on when the proposed system could be in operation. 
</P>
<P>
San Ysidro residents have long complained about the foul odors, mosquitoes and 
other health problems associated with the growing sewage problem. 
</P>
<P>
While untreated Mexican sewage has been flowing across the border for decades, 
Tijuana's growing inability to handle its own waste water has reached crisis 
proportions, transforming an occasional problem -- one that forced the periodic 
closure of local beaches -- into an almost daily woe with more serious 
consequences, Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the councilman added, the amount of raw sewage in the Tijuana River 
Valley has grown from 6 million gallons per day to the current figure of 12 
million to 14 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
That already critical problem likely will worsen, because Tijuana's sewage 
system already is over capacity and many homes there are not even connected to 
the sewer system, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has treated Mexican sewage on an emergency basis in the past. But 
that system, which is capable of handling 13 million gallons of sewage daily, 
has been shut down because of diminished capacity, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Without questioning the seriousness of the situation, some city officials 
expressed a variety of practical and political concerns about the plan to treat 
Mexican sewage at Point Loma until the new international facility is built. 
</P>
<P>
With San Diegans already facing higher sewage bills to pay for a planned 
$2.8-billion upgrade of the Point Loma plant and the city's overall sewage 
system, the plan endorsed Wednesday could create an additional expense to be 
borne by local ratepayers -- should federal or state dollars not be 
forthcoming. Beyond the estimated $3.5-million annual operating bill, it could 
cost "less than $1 million" to build the pump station and other facilities and 
lines needed to carry the Tijuana sewage to Point Loma, according to Deputy 
City Manager Roger Frauenfelder. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Frauenfelder noted that treatment of the Mexican sewage at the Point 
Loma plant, which now processes about 190 million gallons daily, could bring it 
close to its 218-million gallons-per-day capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"Regulatory agencies wouldn't let us get to capacity before they'd come down . 
. . with threats of building moratoriums," Frauenfelder said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 13 YEARS, THEN GETS MARRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando gang member who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter was 
sentenced to 13 years in prison Wednesday -- and then got married. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major sentenced Alfonso 
Tapia, 20, he officiated at Tapia's wedding to the man's girlfriend of eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea bargain last month, Tapia pleaded no contest to charges stemming from 
the Jan. 20, 1989, death of Miguel Jiminez, 15, of San Fernando. Prosecutors 
had charged Tapia with murder, but agreed to the reduced charge because Jiminez 
may have started the fight that resulted in his death. 
</P>
<P>
The case had a curious beginning when a frantic witness reported the fight to 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in Santa Clarita but his 
call was not taken seriously. Deputy Jim Greene told caller Jim Finilla to 
"have a nice day" before hanging up on him. The handling of the call triggered 
criticism from Sheriff Sherman Block and led to a series of safeguards to 
prevent similar mistakes.

HERMOSA REJECTS OIL FIRM'S REQUEST FOR LEASE EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unhappy with negotiations over oil drilling rights in Hermosa Beach, the City 
Council this week refused Macpherson Oil Co.'s request for a two-year extension 
on the lease that allows the firm to drill for oil from the city maintenance 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The council said the refusal was intended to pressure the company, which is 
negotiating an exclusive drilling contract with the city. Instead, Macpherson 
was granted a 90-day extension of its current lease that covers its use of the 
yard. If oil drilling does not start within that time, the lease will expire. 
</P>
<P>
Regulatory hurdles have delayed the start of drilling, and drilling is not 
expected to begin any time soon, said City Manager Kevin Northcraft. 
</P>
<P>
This latest obstacle in the negotiations of the exclusive drilling contract 
involves the firm's desire to slant drill into the city's tidelands, among 
other things, Northcraft said in a memo to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The shortened lease extension underscores the city's ongoing ambivalence about 
oil drilling in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, the city had several wells, but the noise and fumes prompted 
Hermosa Beach to ban oil drilling in 1932. By 1984, however, the city found 
itself with a limited tax base and little cash. Voters -- hoping to raise money 
to repair the city's crumbling streets and sewers -- revived the drilling idea, 
and passed a pair of initiatives permitting drilling from certain city 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the project has progressed in fits and starts, with arguments over 
how much revenue the city will get from drilling, as well as how much noise and 
pollution will be generated by the project. An environmental impact report was 
certified by the city, but only after months of study and delay. 
</P>
<P>
City officials would not elaborate on the contract negotiations. Don 
Macpherson, president of the company, also refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-day extension passed by a 3-2 vote. Councilmen Albert Wiemans and Robert 
Essertier, who have represented the council in the negotiations, were in favor 
of giving Macpherson the full two years as a show of good faith. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke said the refusal to give Macpherson more 
time was intended "to send a message that we want to clear up the remaining 
negotiating points." 
</P>
<P>
The city yard is as Valley Drive and 6th Street.

LOW-INCOME HOUSING RULES EASED FOR COAST AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has voted unanimously to ease the requirements 
that developers of apartments and condominiums in the San Pedro coastal area 
must meet for providing low- and moderate-income units in their projects. 
</P>
<P>
By a 12-0 vote Tuesday, the council deleted a provision in the San Pedro 
Specific Plan that required a minimum of 25% low- and moderate-income housing 
in projects of at least eight units. The now-defunct provision also required 
developers to replace affordable housing demolished for new projects within 18 
months and a two-mile radius of the razed units. 
</P>
<P>
In its absence, builders in the San Pedro coastal zone must now comply with the 
state Mello Act, a much less restrictive set of regulations that city officials 
say is applied in other coastal zones locally and across the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fairness thing," said Dick Takase, a city hearing examiner who 
recommended last spring that the city's Planning Commission approve the change. 
"Why should property owners and developers in San Pedro be subjected to a more 
stringent law than the rest of the city?" 
</P>
<P>
The Mello Act imposes a general requirement for low- and moderate-income 
housing in projects of at least three units, but it requires no specific number 
of affordable units and allows city officials to waive the provision if they 
deem it too burdensome. The law also allows developers to wait up to three 
years to replace affordable housing demolished for new projects, and it permits 
them to build the replacement housing within a three-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents San Pedro, proposed 
switching to the Mello requirements in 1987 because of complaints from 
builders. Local businesses, led by the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, 
lobbied for the change. 
</P>
<P>
"It made it hard for builders to sell their units," Gubler said. "To meet the 
25% requirement, the builders tell us they basically had to subsidize those 
units by raising the price of the other units. And that made those units 
noncompetitive with other units in the area." 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke against the change at Tuesday's council meeting, but several 
residents and community groups opposed it during a public hearing last spring. 
Opponents said they feared the change would reduce the amount of affordable 
housing in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"To eliminate such requirements anywhere in the city is like burying your head 
in the sand," Howard Uller, executive director of Toberman Settlement house, 
wrote in a letter to the city. "A few wealthy developers will benefit from 
this, but it will leave out protections" for low- and moderate-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The boundaries of the San Pedro coastal zone extend roughly from 9th Street on 
the north, south along Pacific Avenue, west on 25th Street, south along the 
Rancho Palos Verdes city line, east along the coastline, and north along 
Cabrillo Beach, Crescent Avenue and Harbor Boulevard.

LAWYER PUTS BLAME ON SILBERMAN AS TRIAL OF REPUTED MOBSTER OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reputed mobster Chris Petti was a "pawn" in a money-laundering scheme directed 
by financier Richard T. Silberman, an ex-con behind on his rent who was 
hustling for money and was cut out of all major decisions by Silberman, Petti's 
defense attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As Petti's long-awaited trial began, defense lawyer Oscar Goodman rejected 
prosecutors' contention that Petti was a central player in the laundering 
scheme and should be convicted just as Silberman was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Petti is "no virgin, no angel and talks with a lot of 'dem's' and 'dose,' " 
lawyer Oscar Goodman said. But talking tough is no crime, and in this case 
there "was a lot of talk and no action," assuredly not enough action for 
conviction, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Petti, rather than being the brains or the founder of the scheme, was a 
victim of it," Goodman told U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving. "Mr. Petti 
was taken advantage of and was used for his reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 63, of San Diego, was indicted in April, 1989, with Silberman and three 
other men on charges of laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent had 
portrayed as the profits of Colombian cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was sentenced to 
46 months in federal prison and fined $50,000 for his role in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was convicted June 28, after a two-month trial, of a technical 
currency violation. On Aug. 24, he pleaded guilty under a plea bargain to a 
felony conspiracy count, averting a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
The three others have each pleaded guilty in the past few months to a sole 
felony count apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, believed to be connected to organized crime in Chicago and Las Vegas, 
has pleaded innocent to all seven counts against him and is free on $250,000 
bail. If convicted on all counts, he could draw 75 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Petti opted to forgo a jury trial and have Irving decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
began the trial Wednesday with an opening statement that recounted the same 
story told at Silberman's trial. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gorder, federal authorities stumbled onto Silberman after 
wiretapping Petti for months in a probe of mob interest in gaming operations on 
the Rincon Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the government's evidence in the case was collected through secret 
recordings, many gathered under a novel federal law -- used for the first time 
-- that allows agents to wiretap even public pay phones. Petti was the target 
of most of the wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Rincon deal fell through, in September, 1988, agents heard 
Silberman call Petti -- whom he had known from a barbershop where both had 
their hair cut -- and ask if he knew anyone interested in laundering money, 
Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
That conversation evolved into two deals with undercover FBI agent Peter J. 
Ahearn, who was posing as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian drug lords, 
Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal was a November, 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock in a 
Silberman gold-mining subsidiary, Gorder said. The second was a February, 1989, 
swap of $200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti introduced Silberman to Ahearn, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
And, Gorder said, Silberman occasionally bragged on tapped phone calls that 
Petti's purported mob "muscle" was available. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder also said there never was any doubt that Petti understood the source of 
Ahearn's money. 
</P>
<P>
As testimony began, prosecutors played a secretly recorded tape of an April, 
1988, conversation Petti had with Mike Caracci, believed by federal authorities 
to be a mob figure in Chicago, in which Petti said of Ahearn, "This guy's with 
some Colombians." 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statment, defense lawyer Goodman did not dispute that Petti 
believed Ahearn's cash purportedly came from drug trafficking. "Hearing 
Colombians, he didn't think of Juan Valdez and coffee beans," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
But, because Petti himself had met Ahearn through Robert Benjamin, a longtime 
acquaintance, and because Petti was struggling in 1988 to make ends meet, he 
trusted Ahearn and "thought (Benjamin) had a live one -- and with a live one 
there is always the possibility of making money," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti expected a fee for putting Silberman and Ahearn together, Goodman said. 
Unknown to Petti, however, Benjamin was an informant cooperating with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
When Silberman called, Petti was flattered, Goodman said, since Silberman was 
"a fellow who appeared to be the most respected among the respected in San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Petti also believed that Silberman was aware of his reputed mob ties, and 
figured Silberman "thought reputed mobsters had a lot of money, a lot of 
contacts," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, however, did not have either, since he had been released from federal 
prison in 1984 after serving nine months of a year-and-a-day sentence for a 
bookmaking conviction and was behind in his rent and car payments and was 
"vulnerable," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman put together both deals without telling Petti the details, Goodman 
said. For instance, Petti believed originally that the first deal would be for 
$200,000, not $100,000, and did not learn of the true value until the deal was 
done, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when the value of the bonds in the second deal turned out to be as much 
as $50,000 less than Ahearn expected, Petti assured Ahearn he would "check out" 
Darryl Nakatsuka, 44, a West Los Angeles security guard who served as a courier 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
To "check out" Nakatsuka, Petti did not rely on any contact in Las Vegas or 
Chicago, Goodman said. Instead, he called Silberman, then told Ahearn that 
Nakatsuka's references were good, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
Petti might say, "I'm a big shot, I'm a gangster, I'll take care of it," 
Goodman said. But what resulted, Goodman said, was "the words but not the 
deeds." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Goodman said, Petti had no knowledge of money-laundering. "If a 
zero-coupon bond hit him in the face," Goodman said, referring to the kind of 
bond used in the second deal, Petti "wouldn't know it." 
</P>
<P>
Ahearn is due to testify today when the trial resumes. Goodman said that a 
focus of defense strategy would be to attack Ahearn's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Petti is not expected to testify in the case, Goodman said. Both Gorder and 
Goodman said they hoped the trial would conclude by the end of next week.

<P>
After two years as the nation's top mental health officer, Dr. Lewis Judd is 
returning to his former position as head of psychiatry at UC San Diego School 
of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Judd, 60, had been on a leave of absence from UCSD to direct the National 
Institute of Mental Health since January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He will resume his UCSD post Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
During Judd's federal tenure, two other professors served as acting chairmen. 
They were Dr. Mark Schuckit, through July, 1988, and Dr. Igor Grant, since 
August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Judd was the first active scientist named as federal mental health director. 
His initiatives have included developing research programs or plans for 
addressing schizophrenia, mental illness in children, and the molecular 
genetics of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, UCSD was designated as a federal center for research into 
how the AIDS virus affects the brain. In addition, last week the San Diego 
county's mental health department received a major federal grant to study how 
to best deal with homelessness among the chronically mentally ill.

FEB. 12 ELECTION SET ON TAX FOR NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newhall school trustees have set Feb. 12 for a special election on an unusual 
proposal that would raise taxes in a single neighborhood by $12 million to 
finance a new school in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees of the Newhall School District formally set the election date 
Tuesday night at the urging of parents from the upscale Summit development in 
Valencia, who said they would pay higher property taxes to have a school in 
their own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Summit parents have sought their own school since a realignment of school 
attendance boundaries in 1988 split their neighborhood between two different 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners would be assessed from $230 to $925 annually, depending on the 
square footage of their property, Supt. J. Michael McGrath said Wednesday. The 
measure must be approved by two-thirds of the area's 1,600 registered voters to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the small pool of voters, the election will be conducted by mail. 
The ballots will be counted Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
There are only about 200 students in the still-developing Summit area, so the 
majority of the students would come from other neighborhoods in the Newhall 
district, McGrath said. The burgeoning Newhall district currently has 4,580 
students, up 5% from last year, he said.

METZGER GOES ON TRIAL IN $10-MILLION SUIT TIED TO BEATING DEATH OF BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A white supremacist accused of inciting the fatal beating of a black man told 
jurors Wednesday the $10-million wrongful-death lawsuit against him is 
government persecution. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a stacked deck. There's no doubt about it," Tom Metzger, who is 
handling his own defense, said during opening arguments. "Understand that I am 
a radical figure and I've had to fight the government from the get-go." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, 52, of Fallbrook, is the leader of the White Aryan Resistance and a 
former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed by Engedaw Berhanu, the uncle of an African man slain by 
neo-Nazi "skinheads" in November, 1988. It alleges that Metzger incited the 
slaying by sending a representative to Portland to preach hate and violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have that much to do with Mr. Berhanu," Metzger said of the trial. 
"This is an insult to my intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Morris Dees, of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, 
Ala., told the Multnomah County circuit jury that evidence would link Metzger 
to the slaying of Mulugeta Seraw. 
</P>
<P>
He described Metzger as a "pathetic" man whose business is hate and whose 
agenda is to "set about training these young skinheads to go out and do 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
"In America, we have the right to hate, but we don't have the right to hurt," 
Dees said. "We're going to ask you to return a verdict so big, that on the 
south border of the state of Oregon there's going to be a wall $10 million high 
that's going to stop Tom Metzger from coming back to this good state." 
</P>
<P>
Dees said a vice president of White Aryan Resistance met with Portland 
skinheads minutes before they attacked Seraw, 27, of Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
In their meeting with WAR Youth vice president Dave Mazzella, the skinheads 
learned techniques to use in assaulting blacks, Dees said. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steven Strasser -- later pleaded 
guilty to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Seraw was returning home from a party about the time the meeting ended. 
</P>
<P>
"The three walked out . . . and stood on the corner about 100 feet away. Kyle 
Brewster looked up the street and said, 'Hey, I see a nigger. Let's go over 
there and mess with him,' " Dees said. 
</P>
<P>
"They drove directly up in front of Seraw and his friends. They drove so close 
these Ethiopians could not go around them. Then they did what they had been 
taught," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seraw was beaten to death with a baseball bat, which "came down on his head 
with such force . . . it just took the whole top of his head off." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said his views are radical, but he denied advocating violence and said 
his police record is clean. 
</P>
<P>
"They may not like his views, but they've never ever found Tom Metzger going 
over the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said he would not call witnesses to dispute the plaintiff's contention 
that he commands legions because he has no legions. 
</P>
<P>
Mieske, who admitting beating Seraw with a baseball bat, testified Wednesday 
that Mazzella visited him and made a telephone call to Metzger a month before 
Seraw's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
He said he kicked Seraw in the head with a pair of steel-toed boots he had 
bought from another WAR member.

A 12-member jury, evenly split between men and women, was chosen Wednesday to 
decide the fate of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies accused of 
stealing $1.4 million in cash from suspected drug traffickers and money 
launderers. The selection of the racially mixed jury, which includes Latino, 
African-American and Asian-American panelists, came after a full day of 
questioning and cleared the way for federal prosecutors and defense attorneys 
to make their opening statements today for the long-awaited trial. 
</P>
<P>
The seven deputies are accused in U.S. District Court of a conspiracy that 
skimmed money seized during narcotics raids. Some of the defendants, who worked 
together on the Sheriff's Department's elite teams that investigated major 
narcotics cases, are also facing theft and tax-evasion charges as part of a 
27-count indictment. The wife of one deputy is also a defendant.

BUSH'S WAFFLING REFLECTS LACK OF FALLBACK STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's conspicuous waffling over tax issues this week reflects two 
fundamental problems: 
</P>
<P>
First, there are sharply conflicting pressures on the chief executive in this 
area, even from his own party. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the White House has not staked out any real fallback position in the 
wake of Congress' rejection of the bipartisan budget agreement that negotiators 
worked out during 4 1/2 months of talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Confused?" the President asked reporters as he took a midafternoon jog after a 
campaign rally in St. Petersburg, Fla., for Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, in what 
appeared to be as much an answer as it was a question. 
</P>
<P>
To a reporter's question about whether he had changed his position on a capital 
gains tax rate cut, Bush responded: "Read my hips" as he jogged by. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's zigzagging has been a boon to Democratic congressional leaders, who lost 
no time in declaring that in view of the President's reversals, they now see no 
need to make difficult decisions of their own until Bush makes clear what he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
And it has highlighted the sharp divisions within the GOP between those such as 
Senate Republicans, who want foremost to reduce the deficit, and those who 
believe that the party can make hay by opposing all tax increases -- blaming 
the deficit on the Democrats later. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion became vividly public Tuesday and Wednesday on the key budget 
question -- whether Bush would accept a trade-off that would give him the 
reduction he has been seeking in tax rates on capital gains in return for a 
Democrat-sponsored tax hike on wealthy Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had argued vigorously for a capital gains cut during his 1988 campaign and 
had made the cut his chief domestic priority. But he had also campaigned 
against new taxes, and holding the line on income tax rates has become a litmus 
test for many conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout September and into the first week of this month, Bush and his 
advisers said he would not accept a trade. Tuesday morning, at a press 
conference, Bush changed his mind, saying that the idea of a tax rate trade-off 
was "on the table." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after protests from Senate Republicans who opposed the trade, Bush 
invited the senators to the White House for a meeting and told them that he was 
taking the idea off the table again. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday -- at least for a while -- the White House tried to backtrack once 
more, sending word that Bush still had an open mind on the issue. "I'm leaving 
everybody's comments out there," Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. "We're 
not taking a position on any specific item." 
</P>
<P>
By midday, Bush seemed to have given up entirely. "Let Congress clear it up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the root of the confusion is the defeat last week of the bipartisan budget 
agreement that Bush's advisers -- Budget Director Richard G. Darman and Chief 
of Staff John H. Sununu -- had negotiated during months of talks with 
congressional leaders at a so-called budget summit. 
</P>
<P>
Darman had devised the summit approach following the conventional wisdom in 
Washington that no budget agreement could ever be reached in public because, by 
definition, cutting the deficit requires politically unpopular tax increases 
and spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
If the leaders of both parties -- the President and Congress -- agreed on a 
deal, Darman believed, everyone would be given enough political cover for the 
accord to pass. 
</P>
<P>
But Darman and Sununu had placed such faith in that theory that they had 
neglected to prepare a fallback plan. When conservative Republicans turned 
against the deal and liberal Democrats joined them, Bush was left twisting, 
figuratively, in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Since that defeat, last Friday, Senate Republican leaders, joined by Sununu and 
Darman, have advocated essentially resuscitating the bipartisan agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Their hope, Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) said, is that members of Congress, 
having had a chance to vote against the plan once, now will vote for a close 
replica, seizing on whatever small changes are made around the margins to 
justify their change in position. 
</P>
<P>
House Republican conservatives, joined by Vice President Dan Quayle and other 
Bush advisers who disliked the summit agreement from the start, argue that Bush 
should drop the bipartisan approach and move to unite his party by turning the 
budget into a partisan issue. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, most Senate Republicans are traditional fiscal conservatives, who 
dislike high taxes but think high deficits are worse. (In the House, a large 
percentage of the GOP caucus, led by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), is made up of 
believers in supply-side theories, who say deficits are not nearly as bad for 
the economy as high taxes.) 
</P>
<P>
The problem may be compounded by the fact that Bush admitted during his press 
conference Tuesday that he is not particularly interested in the entire issue 
of economic policy, preferring instead to concentrate on foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get a problem with the complexities that the Middle East has now and 
the (Persian) Gulf has now, I enjoy" working on that, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I just rejoice every time I go up and talk to Danny Rostenkowski, 
my dear friend, about what he's going to do on taxes," he said, referring to 
the Illinois Democrat who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee.

STUDY FINDS STRESSFUL JOB NOT HARMFUL IN PREGNANCY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: HEALTHY, PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ARE AT NO GREATER RISK THAN OTHER 
EXPECTANT MOTHERS, REPORT FINDS.

Professional women who work long hours in high-stress jobs during pregnancy are 
just as likely as others to have healthy babies, according to a new study that 
researchers say offers reassurance to prospective mothers among the growing 
ranks of working women. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that 
physicians-in-training who worked about 70 hours a week while pregnant were at 
no greater risk than others of having their pregnancies end in miscarriage, 
stillbirth or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were they more likely to give birth early. 
</P>
<P>
"We can say that for . . . generally healthy, upper-middle class women, that 
virtually any type of work during pregnancy is probably not going to harm their 
pregnancy," said Patricia Shiono, an epidemiologist with the Center for the 
Future of Children in Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
Shiono and the other researchers, headed by a pediatrician from the National 
Institutes of Health, cautioned that their findings apply to healthy, affluent 
women. They did not study lower-income and disadvantaged women or women with 
already complicated pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted that women in the study who worked especially long hours -- 100 
hours or more a week -- were more likely to have a preterm delivery. Babies 
born early and therefore underweight face a greater risk than other babies of a 
variety of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any sign of complications, obstetricians are likely to advise 
women to slow down (their work schedules). We would agree with that," said Dr. 
George G. Rhoads, a co-author of the paper. "These findings should not be 
construed (to mean) that you should work through thick and thin." 
</P>
<P>
It has long been believed that women who become pregnant during a medical 
residency face an increased risk of complications. Earlier studies have 
produced mixed results, but some have found an added risk of preterm delivery, 
delays in fetal development and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is considered important not only because of the extraordinary demands 
made upon medical residents, 28% of whom now are women; it is also of interest 
for what it reflects about the effects of work in general on the ability to 
bear a healthy child. 
</P>
<P>
Obstetricians say the risk seems to vary from occupation to occupation and that 
it is difficult to generalize about what women should do, but many believe that 
jobs requiring heavy lifting and long hours of standing may be especially 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a sedentary job, people can work until fairly close to delivery unless 
they run into medical complications," said Dr. Palmer C. Evans, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist in Tucson. "But if they're doing very heavy, manual 
work, a lot of times they need to stop sooner than that." 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a survey of 4,412 women physicians, is the largest 
conducted, the researchers said. They compared the women to 4,236 wives of male 
residents, many of whom worked during pregnancy but only about half the hours 
of the women residents. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, headed by Dr. Mark A. Klebanoff of the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development, found that 13.8% of the pregnancies among 
the medical residents and 11.8% of the other women ended in miscarriage -- a 
difference too small to be significant. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the two groups had comparable percentages of stillbirths, 
under-developed babies and ectopic gestations, in which the fertilized egg is 
deposited outside the uterus. The residents were more likely to have had 
preterm labor and preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced hypertension), but not 
preterm birth. 
</P>
<P>
Klebanoff said it was hard to know what to make of the increased risk of 
preterm labor and preeclampsia without examining each woman's medical records. 
But he speculated that the residents and their obstetricians may have been 
especially alert to symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The only group that showed significant differences in rates of preterm delivery 
were the 143 medical residents who worked 100 hours or more a week during 
pregnancy. They were approximately twice as likely as the others to deliver 
their baby early.

ISRAELI TEAM TO PROBE KILLING OF PALESTINIANS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir named a special investigative team Wednesday to 
look into the police shooting of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem's Old City, and 
Israeli officials said no United Nations inquiry is needed into what they 
regard as an internal matter. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the investigative team, to be headed by a former chief of 
the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, came as Israel awaited a vote in the 
U.N. Security Council on a proposal to condemn the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have indicated that, as in the past, they would accept envoys 
of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar -- but not a group that 
answers to the Security Council, which could order action based on its 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Israeli officials made it clear that any outside investigation is 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
"It will now be investigated by ourselves," Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for 
Shamir, told reporters. "We don't need a probe by international factors." 
</P>
<P>
Ahimeir also said: "We hope our position will be understood. We reacted against 
provocation that was planned against Jewish worshipers. The marginal point of 
whether it was excessive force or not is to be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
At stake in the U.N. action, according to Israeli and Palestinian observers, is 
the perception of who controls the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as 
well as the Arab districts of Jerusalem. Israel has annexed the Jerusalem 
districts, which were seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
Israel maintains that it alone is responsible for security in the occupied 
territories, and admission of a U.N. team would imply a competing authority. 
The Shamir government argues that any settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict must be preceded by direct talks with hostile Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing a move to force Israel to compromise on its claim to the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip, Shamir vowed to hold on to the territory, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"This is our country. This is our land. And no force in the world will change 
this eternal fact." 
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinians see it, U.N. intervention in even an indirect way would 
support their claim to a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, along 
with half of Jerusalem, without their having to deal directly with Israel. The 
Palestine Liberation Organization has been pressing the United Nations for 
several years to send military forces to replace the Israeli army in the 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of principle," Arab affairs expert Asher Susser said. "Who is 
in control of the territories? Once Israel accedes to U.N. observer status, it 
takes a step toward perhaps accepting a U.N. mandate over the area. Israeli 
control would be reduced without negotiations. That's what the Palestinians 
want to happen and what Israel wants to prevent." 
</P>
<P>
The incident under discussion in the Security Council occurred Monday at the 
Temple Mount, a site holy to Jews and Muslims alike. The Dome of the Rock and 
Al Aqsa mosque, major Muslim shrines, stand in the area, the site of a Jewish 
temple in biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rained stones on worshipers at the Western Wall, the Jews' 
most sacred prayer site, and Israeli police retaliated with tear gas and 
gunfire. The death toll was the highest for a single day in the 34 months since 
the start of the Arab uprising against Israeli rule. Dozens of foreign 
governments, including the United States, have criticized Israel for using what 
they have called excessive violence. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member commission named by Shamir replaces a panel appointed by 
Police Commissioner Yaacov Turner, who is under fire for allegedly ignoring 
signs of impending trouble on the Temple Mount, according to Israeli 
newspapers. Arabs had gathered at the site to confront a reported effort by 
Jewish fundamentalists to enter the compound and lay a cornerstone for a new 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
Zvi Zamir, director of Mossad from 1968 to 1974, will head the commission. The 
other members are Yaacov Neeman, a partner in the law firm of President Chaim 
Herzog, and Chaim Kubersky, a former official in the Interior Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, the commission will have no authority to force 
witnesses to testify under oath, and its recommendations will not be binding. 
It will look into the behavior of the Palestinians, the police reaction and the 
matter of police preparedness, then report to the prime minster. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of special investigators is nothing new in Israel. The 
procedure was used to investigate the army's role in the massacre of 
Palestinians in Lebanon by an allied Christian militia force in 1982, and the 
deaths of two Palestinian terrorist suspects at the hands of Shin Bet, the 
domestic intelligence agency, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel has a pretty good track record of investigating itself," said Harry 
Wall, who heads the Anti-Defamation League office in Jerusalem. Wall argued 
that a U.N. investigation would be less reliable and that its results would be 
rejected by the Israeli people. 
</P>
<P>
Reports in the Israeli press suggest that the police failed to act on 
intelligence reports. The newspaper Maariv reported that police officers 
panicked at rumors that some of their colleagues were trapped in a police 
station that had been set on fire by the rioters. 
</P>
<P>
"The (gunfire) was not done in planned fashion or by command, but rather 
independently, based on decisions by isolated policemen or a small force when 
they felt their lives were endangered," Maariv said. 
</P>
<P>
It reported that Shin Bet, the security agency, says it warned police that a 
riot was likely but that police deny getting such a warning. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Haaretz reported that information gathered by investigators so 
far suggests that the Temple Mount protest was not planned ahead of time, as 
some Israeli politicians and commentators have charged. 
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said the police showed a "lack of forethought" by 
not reinforcing units around the Temple Mount. The opposition Labor Party 
issued a statement accusing Shamir's government of "a laxness in security that 
endangered the lives of Jews" worshiping at the Western Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a court in Jerusalem extended the detention of two Palestinians 
suspected of inciting the riot. Faisal Husseini, an activist associated with 
the PLO, and Sheik Mohammed Jamal, a cleric at the Al Aqsa mosque, were ordered 
held for 10 days pending investigation.

U.S. PRESSES FOR COMPROMISE ON ISRAEL AT U.N. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States early today struggled for the third straight day to win U.N. 
Security Council approval of a compromise resolution condemning Israel for 
using excessive force in the deaths of 19 Palestinian demonstrators in 
Jerusalem, but it threatened to veto a harsher measure. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats cautioned that they were working intensively on the wording of a 
possible agreement that could fall apart because of semantics. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the difficulty was language in a resolution put forth late 
Wednesday by nonaligned nations asking U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar to send a mission to the region and to submit a report to the Security 
Council by the end of October. At issue was language regarding the safety of 
Palestinian civilians under Israeli occupation in Jerusalem as well as 
protection of Islamic and Christian holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the sites and language regarding the safety of Palestinians 
reportedly was causing U.S. document drafters great difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. goal was to both express its displeasure toward Israel and keep the 
support of Arab nations aligned with the Bush Administration against Iraq's 
President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering made it clear, however, that the United 
States would vote against a tougher resolution put forth by allies of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization "deploring acts of violence committed by 
Israeli authorities" and authorizing a three-member Security Council 
investigation commission to examine the situation in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The United States favors sending a mission that would report to Perez de 
Cuellar on the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is prepared to avoid a veto if we possibly can, but that's not a 
resolution we can support," Pickering said of the PLO-backed plan, sponsored by 
a coalition of seven nations including Cuba, Ethiopia and Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the stage was set for the possibility of votes on two resolutions, and a 
U.S. veto in favor of Israel could drive a wedge between the Bush 
Administration and Arab states that have allied themselves against Iraq over 
its occupation of Kuwait. In Security Council debate, such gulf allies as Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt have called for a strong response against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday evening, a compromise resolution was circulated, calling for 
Perez de Cuellar to send a mission to the region. The fact-finders would report 
back to the Security Council with recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
But later the proposal was modified to include language on the safety and 
protection of Palestinian civilians and the Islamic and Christian holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has given Iraq, which has been isolated since the Aug. 2 invasion, a 
chance to side with other nations participating in the U.N. embargo on Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli police and security forces opened fire to quell 
rock-throwing demonstrators on Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Nineteen Palestinians 
were killed and 140 were wounded, while more than 20 Israelis were injured. It 
was the bloodiest civil outbreak in East Jerusalem in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the gunfire ended, Arab states pressed for Security Council 
condemnation of Israel. The United States came under strong pressure from 
Britain, France and its other gulf allies to respond forcefully to the 
bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration put forth a draft resolution Tuesday condemning the violence 
and "particularly the excessive Israeli response." The resolution expresses 
deep concern that Israeli security forces were ill-prepared to contain the 
violence and had "responded excessively and with deadly force." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. and British diplomats engaged in intensive behind-the-scenes 
negotiations with the nations pressing for a stronger resolution. 
</P>
<P>
After discussions lasting into the early morning hours Wednesday, diplomats 
grabbed a few hours of sleep before resuming their attempt to reach a 
compromise. At one point, representatives of the five permanent members of the 
Security Council -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France 
and China -- met in caucus behind closed doors at the French U.N. mission. 
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador David Hannay, the current Security Council president, 
rewrote part of the American resolution in the hope it could meet the 
satisfaction of the Arab and nonaligned nations, which submitted their own 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The British compromise called for the secretary general to send a mission to 
report promptly to the Security Council and use all "appropriate resources of 
the United Nations in the region in carrying out the mission." 
</P>
<P>
The strain of the behind-the-scenes negotiations among diplomats was evident. 
At one point, the Palestine representative to the United Nations, Zehdi Labib 
Terzi, who lobbied intensively for the stronger resolution, entered a public 
phone booth to call PLO representatives in Tunisia for instructions. Hours 
later, he was back walking the corridors of the U.N., cornering Security 
Council members. 
</P>
<P>
Pickering, meanwhile, said the United States was working hard "to find a way to 
bring the council together." But he acknowledged the situation was fluid. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a reporter asked the U.S. ambassador if he thought the gap could 
be bridged between the two resolutions in the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather argue with the nonaligned than argue with you about that," he said, 
hurrying off to further consultations.

VIOLENT DEATH IS RARE FATE FOR DETECTIVES ON HOMICIDE BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homicide detectives weren't supposed to die this way, the investigators who 
knew Russell Kuster were saying Wednesday. Street cops, sometimes. Not homicide 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not exposed to the same degree of danger that patrol officers deal 
with," said Detective Rick Swanston. He spent eight years working Hollywood 
homicide under Kuster, slain Tuesday night in a gun battle in a Hollywood 
restaurant. "We usually know what we're dealing with. Folks who get hurt on the 
job, they usually don't know the seriousness of the situation they're getting 
into." 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives are supposed to come in when the gunfire is over, put 
together the evidence and nail the bad guy. Then, after a long career of 
strange, frustrating hours, of cases closed and murders unsolved, they are 
supposed to collect a pension. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to do their time and retire," said Detective Leroy Orozco, a 
28-year veteran of the force, 24 years in homicide. Kuster had been a friend 
for more than 20 years. "Then you can all get together, a bunch of old (guys) 
talking about the old days." 
</P>
<P>
Detective jobs are coveted in police work, and none is more coveted than a job 
in homicide. Kuster's generation has witnessed technical advances such as 
computerized records and DNA fingerprinting, but detectives have also seen the 
growing menace of drugs, gangs and high-powered weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Kuster wound up a victim of the sort of seemingly random violence 
that plagues Los Angeles. He is now part of the 1990 body count that is on a 
pace to exceed the city's record for homicides -- 1,028 in 1980. As of Sept. 
30, 762 slayings had been recorded within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Like every other Los Angeles murder case, Kuster is now the subject of a 
three-ring binder notebook in which homicide detectives assemble interviews and 
evidence. Above Kuster's desk hangs a sign that says: 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Homicide 
</P>
<P>
 Our Day Begins When Yours Ends 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, Kuster was in the cocktail lounge at a favorite 
hangout, the Hilltop Hungarian Restaurant in the Hollywood Hills, when the man 
with the 9-millimeter pistol equipped with laser sights came in, terrifying the 
patrons. So Kuster identified himself as a police officer and tried to calm the 
man. The gunman fired four rounds at Kuster. 
</P>
<P>
As Kuster went down, mortally wounded, he managed to fire seven rounds at his 
killer, striking him three times. 
</P>
<P>
The homicide detective thus solved his own murder. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant was identified as Bela Istvan Marko, 37, a native of Hungary who 
lived in Las Vegas. That, too, proved ironic. Hollywood detectives had arrested 
him in 1982 in the fatal shooting of his roommate. Kuster signed the paper 
work. Marko had claimed self-defense and the district attorney chose not to 
file charges. Police said there is no connection between Marko's earlier arrest 
and the shoot-out Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Retired homicide detective Hank Petroski was one of the detectives who 
investigated the 1982 shooting. Petroski had partnered with Kuster both in 
patrol and in homicide, and worked under his command before retiring this year 
after 25 years with the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
"You understand some guys are going to get off, the D.A. is not going to file 
on others. It's frustrating but you can't let it bother you so much you can't 
do your job," said Petroski. 
</P>
<P>
"If end result is the arrest, you're happy. It's not only satisfaction of work 
done, but relief for the surviving family members," Orozco said. "But then the 
torture really starts because of our court system. . . . That's the toughest 
part of the job, getting into the court system and dealing with the b.s." 
</P>
<P>
Kuster's slaying wouldn't get that far. Detectives wept at Hollywood Division 
on Tuesday night. One of Kuster's men broke down at a press conference 
Wednesday. At other divisions, detectives felt the loss as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got guys here with tears in their eyes," Lt. John Zorn of the 
robbery-homicide bureau at Parker Center said on Wednesday morning. "They've 
known him for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Kuster had put in 24 years on the force, his last 12 as a supervising detective 
in Hollywood homicide. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the best supervisor I ever had," said Swanston, who now heads the 
homicide unit in the West Valley Division. "He was very fair. . . . He demanded 
a lot from you, but he had a tendency to get the best out of his men." 
</P>
<P>
Petroski, who now works as an insurance investigator, said Kuster had told him 
he was going to work one more year and retire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFICERS KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Los Angeles Police Department's best-known and admired officers, 
veteran homicide detective Russell Kuster, was killed in an exchange of gunfire 
Tuesday night. His death raised to 175 the number of LAPD officers who have 
died in the line of duty since 1907. Of those, 88 officers were killed by 
suspects, 36 in car crashes, 31 in motorcycle collisions, 6 in helicopter 
accidents and 14 in other incidents, including bomb explosions. These are 
officers killed since 1985.

U.S. FREEZES PAKISTAN AID OVER NUCLEAR ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
ASIA: ASSISTANCE TOTALING $564 MILLION IS SUSPENDED AS WASHINGTON REVIEWS 
ISLAMABAD'S SUSPECTED WEAPONS PROGRAM.

About half a billion dollars a year in U.S. military and economic aid to 
Pakistan has been frozen and payments cannot be resumed until the Islamabad 
government curtails programs that seem to be intended to produce nuclear 
weapons, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Bush Administration is 
reviewing Pakistan's nuclear program, and Capitol Hill sources said it is 
almost inconceivable that Congress would allow the aid to resume unless major 
changes occur. 
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. law, no aid can be sent to Pakistan unless the President certifies 
each year that Islamabad is not trying to acquire nuclear weapons. For the 
first time since the requirement was imposed in 1985, President Bush declined 
to make such a certification this year, forcing a suspension of aid with the 
start of the new fiscal year Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the Reagan and Bush administrations have issued the needed 
certification, despite accusations in Congress that Pakistan was trying to 
develop and test a nuclear device to match one exploded by India in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were reluctant to take any action that would damage the 
longstanding U.S.-Pakistan relationship, especially at a time when covert 
American assistance to anti-government guerrillas in Afghanistan was being 
channeled through Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had requested $564 million in combined economic and military 
assistance to Pakistan for 1991. For fiscal 1990, which ended Sept. 30, the 
combined total was $581 million. The aid program for Pakistan has been the U.S. 
government's third-largest, following the packages for Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III informed Pakistani 
Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan that U.S. law will not allow continuation 
of the aid programs under current circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary reiterated our view of the need for a comprehensive approach to 
dealing with nonproliferation issues in the region," Tutwiler said. "The 
Pakistani nuclear program remains under review." 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler, who sat in on the meeting Tuesday between Baker and Yaqub Khan, 
provided few details. But she left little doubt that Yaqub Khan provided no 
assurances that would allow Bush to lift the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
When Tutwiler was asked why the Administration had not provided more public 
evidence of its concern with the Pakistani program, she said: "Well, how about 
the evidence that the certification wasn't (made) on Oct. 1?" 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is in a better tactical position to deal firmly with 
Pakistan than in the past because the withdrawal of Soviet forces from 
Afghanistan has reduced the importance of the Islamabad government as a bridge 
between the United States and the Afghan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
On a related matter, Tutwiler said the State Department has never received an 
application for an export license to sell to Pakistan high-temperature furnaces 
needed for the manufacture of nuclear arms. The Washington Post reported 
Wednesday that Pakistan had tried, without success, to obtain such equipment 
from an American company.

EX-PAKISTAN PREMIER BHUTTO'S HUSBAND ARRESTED; SHE SEES 'WITCH HUNT'

Police Wednesday arrested the husband of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, 
who denounced the move as a "pure witch hunt" to intimidate her during the 
current election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Asif Ali Zardari was arrested in Karachi for alleged involvement in 
an extortion case and two cases of illegal bank loans, state television said. 
</P>
<P>
Zardari has been a major target of investigations since Bhutto's dismissal by 
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in August for allegedly heading an administration 
riddled with corruption, nepotism and abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
He was charged in the kidnaping last April of businessman Murtaza Hussain 
Bukhari, a Pakistani-born British citizen, and the extortion of $800,000 from 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"His arrest is pure witch hunt. His arrest is to intimidate and blackmail me," 
Bhutto told a hurriedly convened news conference at her fortress-like seaside 
home. Paramilitary rangers were deployed outside, checking cars. 
</P>
<P>
Thumping on the table with her fists, she said: "Asif has been arrested because 
of a criminal conspiracy against my family hatched by the caretakers 
(government). I demand his immediate release." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto said she feared for her husband's life and that she would apply for 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
She later drove to a police interrogation center and spent 20 minutes with 
Zardari. Police sources said officials stayed with the couple throughout the 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people outside the center chanted, "Release Zardari!" 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto returned late Tuesday to Karachi, about 600 miles south of Islamabad, 
after appearing before a special court in the Punjab provincial capital, 
Lahore. She faces charges there of wrongdoing during her 20 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bhutto and Zardari, who married Bhutto in 1987, are running in the Oct. 24 
National Assembly elections, but she could be barred if convicted. Zardari and 
Bhutto have two children.

Anti-tax crusader Barbara Anderson says she gave the Massachusetts Legislature 
fair warning two years ago when, during the ill-fated presidential campaign of 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, state lawmakers "faked two budgets in one night" in 
their panic over the state's mounting fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there would be tax increases," said Anderson, executive director of 
the 15,000-member Citizens for Limited Taxation. "We told them: 'If you're 
going to do this, you're going to face it on the ballot in 1990. Don't do it!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But the lawmakers paid her no mind, Anderson says. And now, true to her word, 
they are facing a tax-slashing initiative on next month's ballot that -- if 
approved, as some polls show likely -- will amount to the largest reduction in 
state taxes ever in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Measure Would Do 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Anderson's organization and known as "Question 3" for 
its place on the ballot, would cut more than $1 billion out of this year's 
$13.4-billion state budget and double that amount out of next year's spending 
plan, according to official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure say the impact on Massachusetts would be nothing short 
of disastrous, throwing thousands of state workers off the payroll, slashing 
vital human services from day care to elderly lunch programs, forcing the 
shutdown of many schools and colleges, bringing a halt to critical state 
construction projects and sending Massachusetts' already shaky credit rating 
down the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
A formidable array of individuals and groups representing government, business, 
labor and religion have joined forces to defeat the proposal, viewing it as a 
mindless, heartless and vindictive approach to curing the state's fiscal 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Question 3 is a neutron bomb of a political weapon," Boston Globe columnist 
David Nyhan wrote recently, reflecting a widespread sentiment among the 
proposal's critics. "It will kill people, but leave the real estate intact." 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson, who engineered passage in 1980 of a measure known as Proposition 
2 1/2 that put stiff caps on local property tax increases, contends that 
extreme times call for extreme measures. Left to their own devices, she argues, 
state lawmakers would continue to fiddle while Massachusetts burns from bloated 
state budgets, excessive taxation and fiscal irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong silent majority of people who are with us and are just 
waiting for Nov. 6," which is the date of the general election, Anderson said. 
"They're going to vote 'yes' on Question 3 because they know there is no 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts taxpayers are not the only ones up in arms over what they see as 
out-of-control government spending. Louisiana voters earlier this month 
approved a constitutional amendment that limits increases in state spending to 
the prior three-year average increase in state personal income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A National Pattern 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least eight other states, including California, are set to vote 
on ballot measures during elections next month that would place restrictions on 
tax and spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
And in several other states without provisions for voter initiatives to curb 
taxes, such as New Jersey, strong grass-roots movements are seeking 
constitutional amendments that would grant the electorate such rights. 
</P>
<P>
"People feel that the guys they elected are not paying attention to the store 
and keep charging the taxpayers more so they can go off on any tangent they 
want without developing (fiscal) priorities," said Janice Ballou, polling 
director of Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the current anti-tax mood has far to go before it matches that of the 
late '70s and early '80s, when limitation measures were approved in 16 states, 
including California's celebrated Proposition 13, says Scott Mackey, a fiscal 
policy specialist with the Denver-based National Conference of State 
Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Outlook 
</P>
<P>
Of all the anti-tax ballot measures this year, Massachusetts' Question 3 would 
have the most far reaching consequences. It would repeal the $1.8-billion tax 
increase Dukakis signed in July -- the largest in the state's history -- and 
roll fees and charges back to their 1988 levels. It also would cut state income 
tax rates for two years to repay taxpayers for a $740-million tax increase 
enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure concede that, despite their broad-based support and 
vastly superior financial resources, they face a tough battle in winning the 
hearts and minds of Massachusetts voters. 
</P>
<P>
"All the facts are with us, but all the emotion is with the other side," said 
James Braude, head of the Campaign for Massachusetts' Future, a coalition 
opposing the measure. "The issue for November is whether rationality will 
prevail over anger."

A PALL OF ANGER HANGS OVER BLOODIED PLACE OF WORSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM: BOTH ARAB AND JEW REMAIN BITTER TWO DAYS AFTER A DEADLY 
CONFRONTATION AT THE WESTERN WALL.

<TEXT>
<P>
The common act of worship in the Old City is one of the inspiring sights of 
Jerusalem, but on Wednesday a common pall of anger hung over Muslim and Jewish 
shrines in the ancient walled district. 
</P>
<P>
On the Temple Mount, holy to both religions, worshipers at the Al Aqsa mosque 
prayed amid bloodstains on the richly woven Oriental carpets. Bloody clothing 
also was on display, reminders of police gunfire Monday that killed 19 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Below, at the Western Wall, Jews prepared for the conclusion of Succot, the 
feast of the tabernacles. Rocks hurled down from the mount had been cleared 
away from the plaza in front of the wall, but the resentment of the attack by 
rioters remained in the minds of the worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
Talk was apocalyptic: The week's tragedy left only bitterness on both sides and 
a gap of understanding that has long seemed unbridgeable. 
</P>
<P>
"Next week, or next month, more of us will die. We expect nothing less from the 
Jews," said Jihad Hamide Yassini, the father of a 15-year-old boy killed 
Monday, as he looked at the display of bloody clothing in a side room at the 
mosque. The pale-blue shirt of his son, Ezzedin, was among the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to kill anyone," said Rabbi Sholom Gold, a Long Island, N.Y., 
native, as he made his way to the Western Wall. "But we have to be able to live 
here, come here and pray at the wall. Anyone who limits our access must 
understand that he is endangering his own life." 
</P>
<P>
The riot and killings Monday only accentuated a steady degeneration of the 
atmosphere in the Old City during nearly three years of the Arab uprising -- 
stabbings of Jews by Arabs; shootings of Arabs by Jews; clashes between Arabs 
and Jews who have moved into the traditional Muslim quarter of the city; 
clashes between Jews and Christians over the occupation by Jewish seminarians 
of a Christian Quarter building; stonings; marches; tear gas; police chases; 
beatings; searches. 
</P>
<P>
Now, even worship seems like a competition. Some would argue that here it 
always was. 
</P>
<P>
After the deaths Monday, the Temple Mount has become a shrine to martyrdom for 
Palestinians. The fading bloodstains on the marble approaches to the Dome of 
the Rock are marked by prayer rugs. Onlookers stop to count the six bullet 
holes on the western face of the gilt-top dome. Boys finger full metal shells 
collected at Al Aqsa. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a massacre," murmurs a woman in a white veil, the traditional female 
garb at the dome. "The Jews want to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
When she learned an American was present, she shouted, "Why does America help 
Israel? Do you hate us?" 
</P>
<P>
Outside, within winding alleyways, four simultaneous wakes were under way for 
Old City victims. One was at Yassini's house, held for his son. Neighbors sat 
outside sipping coffee and praising the dead boy for defending the mosque 
against Jews. Periodically, a rambunctious group of local youths would march by 
chanting Palestinian slogans and consoling Yassini with a pledge that "we are 
all your sons." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, at the home of Musa Suweiti, a 26-year-old goldsmith killed 
at the Temple Mount, the political tone of the wake was more pronounced. Red, 
white, green and black Palestinian flags and pictures of Yasser Arafat, the 
Palestine Liberation Organization leader, hung on the alleyway walls. 
Nationalist music blared from a stereo. 
</P>
<P>
A patrol of armed soldiers passed by and scanned the rooftop for stone 
throwers, ignoring the illegal display of nationalist symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"More explosions, more explosions," predicted Musa's brother, Majid. 
</P>
<P>
At the Western Wall, the outward signs of tension were less apparent. Soldiers 
kept watch from the heights of the Jewish Quarter. In an indirect reference to 
the trouble, the government urged worshipers to attend celebrations there as 
usual, and police pledged they would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We're angry," said Tsvi Klein, a New York native and 18-year resident of 
Israel. "The police should keep the Temple Mount closed so the Arabs learn they 
pay for what they do. We came here yesterday. We could have been killed." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Drora, said that to remain, the Arabs must accept Jewish rule. "There 
are certain conditions for strangers to stay in this land," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Abe Grunfeld, a visitor from Brooklyn, criticized the Bush Administration for 
its statements that Israeli police need to be better prepared and use more 
restraint in similar situations. 
</P>
<P>
"The world would condemn us for sneezing," he said. "Whatever we do, it will 
bring a condemnation. We don't throw stones up at them." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't reach them," his wife, Yona, remarked dryly. 
</P>
<P>
But Aaron Tomlin, a newly arrived yeshiva student from Canada, expressed shock 
at the incident and at the atmosphere here. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody hates somebody in this country," Tomlin said. "It's sad to walk 
around." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun set Wednesday, turning the blue sky a faded pink, crowds arrived for 
the Simha Torah, or "Joy of Torah," celebration marking the end of Succot. From 
afar, their prayers and song would appear to mingle with the call of the 
muezzin at Al Aqsa proclaiming God is great and calling his own flock to 
worship.

The leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, divided over proposals for 
radical changes in the country's economy, could not decide at a strategy 
session this week what course should be followed and left the choice to 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, top party officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir D. Ivashko, the party's deputy general secretary, said a two-day 
meeting of the party's policy-making Central Committee ended without endorsing 
either the radical program of rapid change favored by Gorbachev aides, or the 
more cautious plan of gradual changes advocated by Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee reaffirmed the party's commitment to developing a market 
economy in place of the present state-owned, government-managed system, Ivashko 
said there had been significant differences among its 401 members over the 
scope and pace of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
This failure to make a decision was startling for a body that once made the 
basic policy decisions for the country. But it reflected the broader 
controversy and confusion here on how to transform the economy while minimizing 
the social trauma likely with fundamental change. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong in principle for the Communist Party's Central Committee to 
act as though it were a branch of the Supreme Soviet (the country's 
legislature) and indulge in comparisons of one or the other programs," Ivashko 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
"The president soon is to present a program considering all opinions in the 
Soviet Union. . . . It has not been presented yet, so there is no possibility 
to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is to put his revised program to the Supreme Soviet on Monday, but he 
has already begun to use his new authority to rule by decree to introduce 
changes in wholesale prices and to attempt to assure deliveries of goods 
ordered by state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee did adopt a resolution on "the political aspects" of the 
transition to a market economy, Ivashko said, but its publication will be 
delayed until agreement is reached on its wording. Also, the committee did not 
want to restrict Gorbachev's freedom of political maneuver by binding him with 
terms of what would be accepted and what would be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko's explanation only underscored the double quandary in which the party 
leadership found itself this week: Although faced with an issue of decisive 
importance for the nation, the Central Committee was unable to reach a 
conclusion -- but it almost does not matter, for real power lies with Gorbachev 
and the country's new legislative bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev appears from the partial accounts provided by Tass, the official 
Soviet news agency, to have been under attack through most of the plenum, as 
much for his leadership as for his policies. 
</P>
<P>
"A clear and firm position is needed, Mikhail Sergeyevich, and your weighty 
word is necessary here if you want to have the party's support," Gorbachev was 
bluntly told by Yuri A. Prokofiev, first secretary of the Moscow party 
committee and a member of the party's Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow's Communists asked me to remind you that you are the general secretary 
of our party's Central Committee, and its affairs must not be pushed aside 
because of the importance of presidential duties." 
</P>
<P>
Briefing Soviet and foreign journalists on the results of the meeting, Ivashko 
and Alexander S. Dzasokhov, another Politburo member, added to the impression 
of a beleaguered Gorbachev, saying they could not yet provide the committee's 
resolution or even Gorbachev's speech a day after the meeting ended. 
</P>
<P>
Sentiment was stronger for the Ryzhkov plan, however, as committee members 
opposed private ownership of land, a key element in the radical program, and 
foresaw only a limited role for private entrepreneurship in industry and 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Central Committee's) plenary session confirmed that our attitude is 
negative," Ivashko said of the proposal to allow private ownership of land once 
again. "In Russia, this is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
The issue has both economic and political importance, and it was featured 
during the two days of debates, according to accounts of the discussion 
published Wednesday in Moscow. The meeting opened Monday and ran until late 
Tuesday, a day longer than planned because of the heated debates. 
</P>
<P>
Private ownership is a key element in the radical reform program proposed by 
Stanislav S. Shatalin, a member of Gorbachev's Presidential Council, and it is 
intended to help bring about the agricultural resurgence the country needs in 
order to feed itself. 
</P>
<P>
Who owns the land -- the state or the farmer, or a collective body -- also 
affects the ownership of natural resources and their allocation, the cost of 
industrial as well as agricultural production and, ultimately, the efficiency 
and character of the market economy the country develops. 
</P>
<P>
But it has already become the defining issue on whether the reforms take place 
"within the socialist choice," as Gorbachev assured the Central Committee they 
would, or whether they bring "the restoration of capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
"We need a mechanism that will help us eventually create diverse forms of 
collective, leasehold and investor ownership," Gorbachev said in his closing 
remarks, as reported by Tass on Wednesday, "but everything should be controlled 
by the people." 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko said the committee could only agree to private ownership of land if it 
were approved in a nationwide referendum, and he predicted that voters would 
reject it. Proposed by Gorbachev last month, the referendum would quickly turn 
into a vote on the whole of the economic reform, thus raising the stakes 
considerably, for a "yes" majority could not be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the conservatism of the meeting, Ivashko also stressed the limited 
nature of the privatization under the reforms. At most, 7% of production would 
be involved over the next decade, he said, and the state would remain the owner 
of virtually all major enterprises and would retain control of all important 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
"The draft program for the transition to a market economy is the first-class 
funeral of socialism and communism," V. T. Chuikov, a bricklayer from the 
Ukrainian city of Poltava, declared.

Pravda, that unequaled purveyor of the Communist Party line and longtime 
flagship of the Soviet press, is in a panic these days, its editor-in-chief 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions are falling off by the millions, the staff is pushing out 
Editor-in-Chief Ivan T. Frolov, and Frolov, complaining of slander and 
back-stabbing, told reporters he will be only too happy to go. 
</P>
<P>
The ruckus at the Soviet Union's oldest daily newspaper has reached the point 
that the Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee decided this week 
to ask the Politburo to straighten out the matter, and Frolov, although 
denouncing "those who air their dirty linen," decided to go public with his 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been persecuted," said Frolov, a philosopher by profession and a close 
adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda's troubles come amid scrambling and anxiety in much of the Soviet press 
as it tries to adjust to new freedoms and tougher competition for readers, now 
that prices for all publications have more than doubled. The annual 
subscription campaign ends this month, and initial reports show readership 
falling off almost across the board. 
</P>
<P>
But few publications appear to have as gloomy an outlook as Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
"A panicked mood arose over the subscriptions," Frolov said, and he heard some 
staff members asking, "Will there be a Pravda in 1991?" 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, which once boasted a circulation of 11 million, has lost 3 million 
readers this year. No figures are available for next year's subscriptions, but 
Vladislav Yegorov, an official on Pravda's Communist Party committee, said that 
in a "typical Russian city," where 9,000 people now subscribe, only 240 had 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the decline, Frolov said, "The most essential reason is the 
loss of prestige of the party." 
</P>
<P>
But some staff members point the finger at Frolov himself. Yegorov said the 
controversy over the editor-in-chief heated up last week when members of the 
newspaper's party committee proposed, in diplomatic terms, that he resign. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda reporters complain that Frolov is disrespectful to them and that under 
his guidance the newspaper is failing to meet Soviet journalism's new standards 
for tough reporting and fresh writing. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when the editor-in-chief of the official newspaper of the 
party's Central Committee would have been so clearly an inhabitant of the 
Communist Olympus that such an attack from below would have been unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
But in these days of democratization, Yegorov felt free to tell reporters in a 
Pravda corridor that it had been a mistake for Gorbachev to hire a 
non-professional. 
</P>
<P>
The party "has a habit of appointing bathhouse directors as conductors of the 
philharmonic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frolov, for his part, complained that all his life he has clashed with party 
committees like Yegorov's that want to tell him what to do, and that he had 
hoped to see the end of them in his old age. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cross I've carried all my life," he said with an angry tone that 
contrasted with his usual droning, academic manner. "Now that I'm a member of 
the Politburo, I'm still carrying it." 
</P>
<P>
Frolov, 61, took over at Pravda a year ago, replacing the more conservative 
Victor G. Afanasyev amid predictions that, as a Gorbachev man, he would make 
the stodgy paper into a showcase for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Frolov told reporters he soon found that Pravda's potential was limited by its 
personnel. As the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky put it, he said, "You can't 
play a nocturne on a drainpipe." 
</P>
<P>
He said that when the party committee meeting attacked him, he said, "I can't 
-- I don't want to work at this newspaper," but when he applied to the Central 
Committee to be relieved, he was told to go on working. 
</P>
<P>
Yegorov said it was not clear who might replace Frolov, and other staff members 
said that Gorbachev appeared to fear that, without his ally heading Pravda, 
hard-line Communists might lay claim to the job and turn the newspaper into a 
conservative mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda modernized its appearance under Frolov, although it retained its slogan: 
"Workers of the world, unite!" And it began carrying advertising and 
experimenting with color. It also revived a "discussion club" featuring 
opposing views. 
</P>
<P>
But its style remained wooden, and it tended to fill its pages with the texts 
of long speeches by party leaders, government announcements and obscure 
theoretical debates. 
</P>
<P>
Frolov promised that so long as he remains at Pravda, he will fight for its 
independence, avoid sensationalism and watch over ideology to prevent it from 
turning into "Anti-Communist Pravda." 
</P>
<P>
He assured reporters that the newspaper, which has survived much since it was 
founded by V. I. Lenin in 1912, is not finished. 
</P>
<P>
"Pravda was, is, and will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, whose name means "truth," listed Josef Stalin among its staff when it 
was first published in 1912 as a Bolshevik organ in St. Petersburg, now 
Leningrad. After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, it became the leading 
newspaper in the Soviet Union. The organ of the Communist Party Central 
Committee, it is printed in dozens of cities. Its role was to cover and 
interpret news in accordance with official policy. Soviet citizens and foreign 
observers long have watched it for shifts in policy.

More than 40 pilot whales have died near New Zealand's Coromandel Peninsula 
over the past few days after beaching themselves, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers and conservation officers managed to coax many of the whales back to 
sea, but some returned to the peninsula on the east coast of New Zealand's 
North Island or were too exhausted to survive.

TENTATIVE CLEAN AIR BILL ACCORD REACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
House and Senate negotiators, apparently breaking a deadlock that had 
threatened passage of a new Clean Air Act, tentatively agreed Wednesday on 
far-reaching measures to reduce smog-causing car emissions over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement extends automobile emission standards adopted by California to 
the rest of the nation and establishes an innovative pilot program in which 
"clean fuel" vehicles -- cars running on fuels that release only a fraction of 
the pollution caused by conventional gasoline -- will be sold in California 
starting in 1996. The plan is expected to receive formal approval when House 
and Senate conferees meet later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"California is going to lead the way for the nation in putting alternatively 
fueled vehicles on the road," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a 
clean air advocate and one of the chief architects of the compromise reached 
early Wednesday after an all-night negotiating session. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we are going to have a strong federal law, one with real 
teeth in it, to force a major reduction of smog in this country," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was resolved through a complex compromise negotiated by House and 
Senate staff aides, although members of Congress were involved throughout and 
are expected to adopt the measures. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement was quickly criticized by environmentalists and 
California air quality officials for conceding too much to the automobile and 
oil industries. 
</P>
<P>
State officials were especially upset with a provision that, if retained in the 
final bill, would prevent them from regulating smog-causing emissions from 
several classes of "off-road" vehicles, such as tractors, compressors and other 
farm or construction equipment powered by engines of less than 175 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
"Off-road vehicles in this category account for nearly 10% of California's smog 
problem. We are in the process of developing regulations for these pollution 
sources, but if this deal goes through it will stop us in midstream," said Bill 
Sessa, a spokesman for the state's Air Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
While the air board and other state officials vowed to fight the off-road 
vehicles provision, the dispute that had threatened the negotiations with 
collapse concerned the right of other states to adopt and enforce a clean fuels 
program established under the legislation for California. 
</P>
<P>
Under both the House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill, other states 
could "opt in" to the program that begins in California in 1996, with the 
federally mandated production of 150,000 clean fuel vehicles. However, under 
the terms of a controversial proposal pushed by auto industry supporters, the 
authority to enforce the program outside of California would have been 
entrusted to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists argued that the states should retain the right to administer 
the program because of EPA's long record of failure in enforcing strong clean 
air regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was finally resolved through a complex compromise negotiated by House 
and Senate staff aides. 
</P>
<P>
States that adopt the California program will retain the right to enforce it 
but, in return, deadlines for some other regulations will be relaxed, 
conference sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement does a lot of things to make cars cleaner, but the price that is 
being paid for this is delay," said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist with the Sierra 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the reductions (in polluting emissions) are now not going to begin to 
take effect until the late 1990s, which gives the auto and oil industries more 
time than they actually need to meet many of these requirements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also criticized a compromise that would push back the 
deadline for oil companies to sell cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline in the 
nation's nine smoggiest cities. Instead of 1992, they will have until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has threatened to veto any bill that costs substantially 
more than $20 billion per year but is expected to be generally pleased by the 
compromises struck Wednesday.

JUSTICES QUESTION FETAL-PROTECTION JOB POLICIES 
</P>

The Supreme Court reacted skeptically Wednesday to a company's claim that it 
can exclude all young women from its battery plants to protect their potential 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me you are not coming to grips with the Pregnancy Discrimination 
Act," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told an attorney for the Johnson Controls Co. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia chimed in, saying that Johnson Controls was turning the 
anti-discrimination law "into a dead letter, a farce." 
</P>
<P>
They referred to a 1978 law in which Congress banned discrimination on the 
basis of pregnancy. Johnson Controls, the nation's largest maker of car 
batteries, says that high levels of lead in its plants have forced it to 
exclude all potentially fertile women. 
</P>
<P>
That policy, however, is not in effect in the company's Fullerton plant, 
because a California appeals court last February struck it down as a "blatant, 
overt violation" of state anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
Justice O'Connor hinted that the policy may also violate the 1978 federal law, 
saying: "Your policy applies to women who are not pregnant and can perform the 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, companies contended that they were discriminating against 
pregnant women only in the interest of their children, Scalia said. But he 
added that federal law now forbids such discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a federal appeals court in Chicago shocked women's rights advocates 
by upholding the company's "fetal-protection policy" without a trial. The 
judges did not require the company to prove that any children had suffered harm 
or show why women in their 50s also were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Women's rights lawyers said that this decision, unless overturned by the high 
court, could threaten millions of women whose jobs -- whether in hospitals, 
offices or manufacturing sites -- could expose a fetus to hazards. 
</P>
<P>
But the company says that lead is so dangerous to a developing child and so 
difficult to remove from the air that women can be excluded from its facilities 
to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
Lead "poisons the fetus and causes permanent brain damage," said Milwaukee 
attorney Stanley Jaspan, representing the company. 
</P>
<P>
"How often does this happen?" asked Justice John Paul Stevens, noting that the 
court record did not show proof that any child had been harmed by a mother's 
employment at a battery plant. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the justices agree among themselves that the appeals court ruling must 
be reversed, they could be divided over how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer representing the women workers, said that 
these female employees, not the company, should decide whether they must leave 
their jobs to protect their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
In a friend-of-the-court brief, the Justice Department agreed that the appeals 
court ruling must be reversed, but it said that the case should be sent back 
for a trial. There, the company could be given a chance to prove that it cannot 
operate safely and reasonably with fertile women in its battery plants. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling in the case (United Auto Workers vs. Johnson Controls, 89-1215) is not 
likely for several months.

America's biggest oil spill has turned into America's biggest yard sale. 
</P>
<P>
A year-and-a-half after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, millions of dollars in 
surplus oil spill cleanup gear is being auctioned off this week in a dizzying 
selling spree that is attracting buyers from all over North America. 
</P>
<P>
For sale are more than 50 acres of new and used equipment accumulated by Exxon 
during the cleanup -- piles of inflatable boats, a fleet of trucks, cars and 
buses, warehouses full of office supplies and beds, mountains of fishing nets. 
</P>
<P>
So much gear is for sale -- from crates of orange rubber life rings to a 
turboprop airplane on pontoons -- that prospective buyers need a special 
335-page catalogue to keep track of it and auctioneers use a rolling, elevated, 
glassed-in booth to move slowly through masses of people, selling off the 
merchandise at an estimated 20% to 60% below retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
Among the loot: 50 portable toilets; 300 two-way radios; 243 outboard motors; 
10 pallets of sand and kitty litter; 39 fully furnished mobile homes; 67 trucks 
and utility vehicles; 221 aluminum skiffs; 15 cranes; 20 boxes of coveralls; a 
box of handcuffs and handgun cleaning kits; a shipping van full of office 
stationery; 38 pallets of typewriters, copiers, fax machines and paper 
shredders. 
</P>
<P>
After two summers of removing oil from Alaska's Prince William Sound, Exxon 
sold much of its spill equipment to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers International 
Ltd., a Vancouver, British Columbia, liquidation firm. No one is saying how 
much Ritchie Bros. paid, but officials with the auction firm said they hoped 
this week's sale brings in at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The auction company put together 4,844 lots of items for the four-day sale, 
grouped to appeal to individuals as well as commercial buyers. While some lots 
contain only a single file cabinet or outboard boat motor, there are others 
with 84 new pairs of size 12 rubber boots and 900 bed sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 people showed up at an airport industrial park to register to bid

<P>
County supervisors have ordered an investigation into the alleged misuse of 
county personnel and equipment in the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich called for the probe after published reports 
indicated that one foreman was suspended for his alleged actions, but was not 
fired because others had not been punished for similar actions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Parrish, a foreman in the Pasadena shop where workers allegedly built 
boat racks, fishing-lure molds and other items for his personal use, was

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 GUILTY OF DEFRAUDING AIRLINE IN TICKET 
SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were convicted Wednesday of defrauding American Airlines out of $1.3 
million by obtaining free flights through a Woodland Hills travel agency that 
had access to the airline's computer reservation system. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury deliberated one day before convicting James Robert Winkleman, 
35, and Phillip Ross Rinker, 35, owners of North Ranch Travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, Brenton Neil Mullins, 29, of Playa del Rey also was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Winkleman was convicted on 14 charges of conspiracy, mail fraud and other 
counts, while the other men were convicted on 10 criminal counts. 
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1988, the now-defunct North Ranch Travel agency leased American 
Airlines computerized reservations terminals. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants used the terminals to set up frequent flier accounts under 
fictitious names and then credited flights taken by actual passengers to the 
bogus accounts, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gary Lincenberg alleged during a one-week 
trial.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY DEADLOCKS ON MAN'S COMPETENCE FOR 
TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury this week was unable to reach a verdict on whether a murder defendant, 
who said he had spoken with Jesus and described himself as a "fallen angel," 
was mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in the Van Nuys Superior Court hearing told Judge James M. Coleman after 
deliberating for a day and a half that they had deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of 
finding Christopher Michael Rowland, 22, incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a new jury will have to be selected to determine the matter, said 
Rowland's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender William M. Thornbury. Jury selection 
in the new hearing was set for Nov. 5. A separate jury will be chosen if 
Rowland stands trial. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland is accused of stabbing to death Roberta Rosentheim, 18, in a Van Nuys 
motel on Feb. 12, eight days after they met. Rosentheim had been introduced to 
Rowland, a drifter, by her brother and immediately fell in love with him, 
family members said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASE DROPPED IN ASSAULT ON 2 MURDER 
SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors dropped their case Wednesday against a jail inmate who allegedly 
assaulted two Northridge college students accused of murdering a Pacoima 
pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Felony charges against Thaddeus K. Bonner, 36, were dismissed after a San 
Fernando Municipal judge ruled that Dana Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19, 
would not be required to testify against Bonner at a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Singer and Dimenno argued that cross-examination of their clients 
during the preliminary hearing could have hurt efforts to defend them against 
charges that they murdered Pastor Carl White on July 28. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't make anything without the testimony of the two witnesses," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Victor Minjares said, explaining the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Dimenno and Singer were injured in an assault Sept. 11 in an inmate lockup area 
of the San Fernando Courthouse.

COUNTY URGES END TO REMAP DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A FEDERAL APPELLATE PANEL HEARS CONTENTION THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL 
PRECEDENT TO A RULING THAT SUPERVISORS WERE BIASED AGAINST LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Los Angeles County urged a federal appeals court Wednesday to 
overturn a lower-court ruling that found the Board of Supervisors discriminated 
against Latinos, contending that the decision was without legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals gave no indication 
of how or when it would rule in the historic voting-rights case. 
</P>
<P>
The decision could change political representation for many of the county's 8.5 
million residents and tip the balance of power on the board from conservatives 
to liberals. 
</P>
<P>
During a crowded two-hour hearing, lawyers for both sides repeatedly were cut 
off in mid-sentence by the judges asking pointed legal questions. The judges 
had already been provided with a foot-high stack of legal briefs. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Alex Kozinski questioned whether the supervisors' desire to preserve 
their seats constituted intentional discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union responded: "What 
the supervisors decided was that in order to get reelected they had to fragment 
the Hispanic voting strength" in drawing district boundaries in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Kozinski also asked about the "revolutionary proposition" put forth by the 
plaintiffs that a government body should be required to redistrict as soon as a 
minority group becomes a majority of a district's voters. The judge contended 
that such a practice could disrupt the "stability" of government. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum responded: "The purpose of the Voting Rights Act was to stop 
discrimination as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Irving Gornstein, a Justice Department lawyer, added that the dramatic 
demographic changes in Los Angeles County since the supervisors' 1981 
redistricting made the case unusual. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing the county's case, lawyer John McDermott told the court: "The 
District Court relaxed one legal standard after another to save the plaintiffs 
from defeat." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the county's argument is that the supervisors could not in 1981, 
or today, fashion a district in which a majority of the voters are Latino, 
because many Latinos are not citizens or are not old enough to vote. 
Plaintiffs' attorneys contended that Latinos in 1981 could have influenced 
supervisorial elections had they not been fragmented among three districts. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said the lower-court ruling violates "the most established and 
indisputable rule of law" in requiring a redistricting, even though in 1981 
Latinos could not constitute a majority of a district's voters. 
</P>
<P>
He also contended that preliminary 1990 U.S. Census figures differ greatly from 
population estimates used by the lower court for drawing new district 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott asked the appeals court to hold off putting any redistricting plan in 
effect until final census figures are released in March.

A burning storefront collapsed and fell onto several firefighters as they 
battled a tire fire, authorities said. Five firefighters suffered minor 
injuries in the fire, which gutted the B.F. Goodrich tire store, firefighters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze caused firefighters trouble because it kept reigniting, said Santa 
Ana Fire Department Battalion Chief Jim Dalton. One firefighter suffered a 
burned neck and broken ankle, two received minor injuries and two others 
suffered smoke inhalation when the building's facade collapsed. "A couple of 
the officers who were directing saw the facade weakening and starting to come 
down and as they moved . . . within voice range, the facade started falling 
from the south end," Dalton said. "It fell so fast that it hit the men before 
the officers could even get to them. They had to pull a couple of the guys out 
from underneath."

A Ventura County Municipal Court judge on Wednesday ordered a murder trial for 
David Wayne Sconce, a former Pasadena undertaker accused of poisoning rival 
mortician Timothy Waters, 24, with oleander in 1985. Waters died at his 
parents' Camarillo home. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Sconce, now 34, spiked Waters' drink with oleander at 
an unnamed restaurant, but they admitted Wednesday they have no proof the men 
ever saw each other around that time. The order came less than a week after 
Sconce finished a prison term for charges dealing with the illegal operation of 
his family's Lamb Funeral Home in Pasadena. Sconce was jailed after pleading 
guilty in 1989 to charges that he conducted mass cremations and sold gold teeth 
removed from bodies, and that he paid two men to beat Waters for spreading word 
of the violations among Los Angeles County undertakers.

O'BANNON OF UCLA SUFFERS KNEE INJURY; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: FRESHMAN FROM ARTESIA HIGH INJURED IN PICKUP GAME. HE WILL HAVE 
SURGERY, MISS THE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ed O'Bannon, who was projected as a possible basketball starter at UCLA as a 
freshman, severely injured his left knee during a pickup game on campus Tuesday 
night and will be sidelined for at least 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Tests showed Wednesday that he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament and 
meniscus cartilage and will need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when he fell to the court after dunking and landed 
awkwardly on his left leg. Bruin forward Don MacLean said the injury occurred 
near the end of an informal five-on-five pickup session of UCLA basketball 
players at the John Wooden Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's to say if we had finished five minutes earlier, it never would have 
happened?" said MacLean, who was playing opposite O'Bannon. "God, it's a 
shame." 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon, a highly recruited 6-foot-8 forward from Artesia High in Lakewood, 
told those who gathered around him as he lay on the floor that he had slipped 
on some water on the court beneath the basket, but MacLean wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he just came down wrong on it, myself," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Although O'Bannon walked off the court unaided, he was examined by several of 
the UCLA physical training staff, including basketball trainer Tony Spino, and 
further tests were scheduled. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging test revealed the 
extent of O'Bannon's injury. 
</P>
<P>
The MRI was performed by J. David Grauer, an orthopedic surgeon and assistant 
team physician. Grauer indicated that O'Bannon would need about a year to 
recover from surgery, which has not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick cut short a stay in the Palm Springs area and rushed back to 
the campus after hearing the news. Harrick had gathered his coaching staff at a 
desert resort to work out team personnel moves in detail and discuss the use of 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We can just throw it out the window now," he said. "I really feel bad for the 
young man. That's the worst part. Sure, this is certainly a big step back for 
us because it changes the composition of the team dramatically, but it's the 
kid and the family that it hurts the most." 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon, one of the more widely recruited players in the nation, averaged 24.6 
points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists a game last season and led Artesia to a 
29-2 record. The Pioneers won the Southern Section 4-A championship and the 
state Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon was named most valuable player of the West team in the Dapper Dan 
Classic, a high school All-Star game, and scored 19 points in the McDonald's 
All-Star game. In July, he averaged 11.5 points a game and helped the U.S. 
junior national team win the Championship of the Americas tournament in 
Montevideo, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Amid such acclaim, O'Bannon also ended speculation on his playing future. He 
decided to attend Nevada Las Vegas, the defending national champion, selecting 
the Rebels over UCLA, USC and Arizona State. However, O'Bannon and another 
prized UNLV recruit, 6-foot-5 Shon Tarver, a guard from Santa Clara High in 
Oxnard, did not sign letters of intent with the university. 
</P>
<P>
When UNLV was barred from the postseason tournament for NCAA sanctions stemming 
from incidents of 13 years ago, O'Bannon and Tarver were free to go to another 
school. Both chose UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon's injury is a major blow to the Bruins, who were anticipating that he 
would move smoothly into the gap left by forward Trevor Wilson, now with the 
Atlanta Hawks. Now, Harrick may chose to fill that spot with 6-9 freshman 
Rodney Zimmerman of Colorado Springs, 6-7 sophomore Zan Mason, who had 
reportedly considered transferring from UCLA because of an anticipated lack of 
playing time, or 6-8 senior Keith Owens, a former walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules forbid practice sessions in the presence of coaches until Oct. 15, 
the first day of organized practice. But pickup games are considered routine 
and are acceptable to the NCAA, according to Chuck Smrt of the enforcement 
division. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean said O'Bannon had stolen the ball and driven to the basket. The next 
thing MacLean knew, O'Bannon was writhing on the floor, crying out in pain. 
</P>
<P>
"He went up and dunked and everything was normal, then he came down," MacLean 
said. "I saw it. It didn't look like anything out of the ordinary. But he 
started yelling and screaming about his knee. 
</P>
<P>
"He actually got up and walked off the court after a while. I thought he was 
OK. I came back about an hour and a half later and they tell me he screwed up 
his knee." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Gerald Madkins, who was playing on MacLean's team, said it was just bad 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins knows how it feels to be injured. He was sidelined for the 1988-89 
season after he was seriously injured in a head-on collision when a car struck 
the moped he was driving. Madkins suffered multiple fractures of his pelvis and 
a torn abdominal muscle. After two operations, Madkins returned to the UCLA 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough on a young guy and I know how it affects you mentally," Madkins 
said. "We pray for him. Let's hope he gets through this thing OK, because we're 
going to need him."

NL GAME 5: PITTSBURGH PITCHERS COMBINE TO STOP REDS WITH A 3-2 VICTORY. 
CINCINNATI LEADS SERIES, 3-2.

<P>
The hug lasted 10 long seconds, the two heroes wrapping their arms around each 
other as they walked from the first base line to the pitchers' mound. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Doug Drabek and Bob Patterson had just carried the Pittsburgh Pirates 
back to Cincinnati. While a stadium rocked and teammates danced, they could 
think of no better way to share their relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I said . . . well, you just don't know what to say," Drabek said quietly. "For 
me, for Bob, for most guys, this was the biggest games in our career." 
</P>
<P>
In a contest that featured a dynamic eight innings from Drabek and a dramatic 
final three pitches from Patterson, the Pirates defeated the Cincinnati Reds, 
3-2, Wednesday night to cut the Reds' lead to three games to two in the 
National League championship series. 
</P>
<P>
The final two games of the best-of-seven series will be at Cincinnati's 
Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But in a game that began with the Pirates overcoming a deficit and ended with a 
double play as the tying run crossed the plate, the Pirates began believing in 
themselves again. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Tuesday night when Cincinnati pitcher Jose Rijo declared that the 
series was "over"? The Pirates have a message for Rijo. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his words were a little premature," Pirate shortstop Jay Bell said. 
"Most of the time, if you are leading three games to one, you can say that. But 
the Reds have to understand, we aren't like most teams." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates proved that Wednesday before 48,221 at Three Rivers Stadium. And 
their most nervy moment occurred after Drabek showed why he is the favorite to 
win the Cy Young Award by limiting the Reds to two runs, one earned, in 8 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
His accomplishments were overshadowed when he left the game in the ninth after 
allowing a leadoff single to Paul O'Neill, a single off the third base bag by 
Eric Davis and a sacrifice bunt by Hal Morris. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on second and third, Drabek was replaced by Patterson, who had 
spent part of eight years in the minor leagues before this summer, when he 
completed his first full major league season. 
</P>
<P>
Owning only six career saves, Patterson was handed the ball and two 
assignments: First, intentionally walk Chris Sabo to load the bases, and then 
do anything to keep Jeff Reed from hitting a fly ball to score the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out there and tried to block everything out of my mind but the catcher's 
glove," Patterson said. "But it wasn't easy." 
</P>
<P>
He took care of the intentional walk, but it wasn't easy, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a guy throw two straight wild pitches on intentional walks in triple 
A," Patterson said. "You don't forget that." 
</P>
<P>
Then up stepped Reed, and Patterson's first pitch was a ball, and suddenly he 
was even more nervous. But he threw a called strike inside, and then another 
pitch inside that Reed grounded slowly to third base. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla, playing his first game at third since Aug. 1 because of Jeff 
King's sore back, lunged to his left, grabbed the ball, threw to second baseman 
Jose Lind, and Lind easily turned the double play to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium shook and the Pirates' dugout emptied, with nobody running faster 
than Drabek, who nearly tackled Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something special with Doug and I -- we came to the Pirates at about 
the same time, we have been through the same things, and tonight it seemed so 
natural for us to help win this game together," said Patterson, 31, who earlier 
this season saved Drabek's 20th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who was the only Pirate player to cry after they clinched the East 
Division championship, appeared to be near tears again as he added, "In a game 
like this, with everybody counting on you -- I don't think anybody can 
understand what it is really like to come through." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, perhaps, except Drabek. Although his regular-season record of 22-6 was 
considered special. It is also noteworthy that whenever he pitched after two 
consecutive Pirate losses, he was 6-0, and he was 12-3 in starts after a Pirate 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
In lowering his playoff earned-run average to 1.65 in two starts Wednesday, 
that stopper trend has continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to pitch in those games where we need wins," Drabek said. 
"I've just been lucky that a lot of times when we've needed a game, it's been 
my turn to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Miller, the Pirates' pitching coach who was worked with such greats in 
Baltimore as Jim Palmer, Steve Stone and Mike Flanagan, was not so humble. 
</P>
<P>
"He is having the best season of any pitcher I have ever coached, and this is 
why," Miller said. "The man just does not panic." 
</P>
<P>
Neither, apparently, do the Pirates. And in an odd way, they have history as 
their ally. 
</P>
<P>
Only twice before have Pirates' teams trailed 3-1 in seven-game series. Both 
times, in the 1925 and 1979 World Series, they rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
The larger picture is not so bright. Since the best-of-seven format was adopted 
for the league championship series in 1985, only two teams have rebounded from 
3-1 deficits to advance to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I would still rather be in a Reds' uniform," said the Pirates' Andy Van Slyke, 
who had a run-scoring triple and a single. "They are still up 3-2. We still 
have to win two straight games at their place. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't simple Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds scored one in the first. The Pirates answered with two in the bottom 
of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the fourth, some unorthodox Reds' strategy helped Pittsburgh take a 
3-1 lead. Barry Bonds led off with a walk, went to third on R.J. Reynolds' 
single to left and scored on a fly-ball out by Don Slaught. However, Reynolds' 
hit got past Barry Larkin only because the Reds' shortstop was covering second 
base, since Bonds was running on the pitch. Usually, with a right-handed 
hitter, the second baseman covers second. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds made it 3-2 when Larkin hit a run-scoring double in the eighth, and 
both teams spent the rest of the game on edge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first playoff, and now I can understand what everybody means when 
they talk about it being so different from the regular season," Reynolds said. 
"This is nerve wracking."

IT'S TOO LATE TO TRADE FOR A PASS RUSHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the Oct. 16 trading deadline approaching and defensive players at a 
premium, Ram Coach John Robinson said he doubts a deal can be made for the pass 
rusher they need. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're going to make any trades; we would not disrupt ourselves 
at this point," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to come up with the solutions ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to trade a good player. And nobody really wants to trade a good 
defensive player, particularly a good defensive lineman." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was interested when he heard that the San Francisco 49ers, needing a 
running back because Roger Craig is sidelined with a knee injury, are 
reportedly making offers for the Raiders' Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's none of my business," Robinson said about the 49ers' interest in 
Allen. "I don't have any comment on it. As the President says, I can't comment 
on speculation." But when Robinson was asked if Allen seems to fit the 49ers' 
offensive scheme, he just nodded his head and quietly said, "I think so, yes."

BRONCOMANIACS COULDN'T HANDLE LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman at Mile High Stadium became so upset with two drunken Bronco fans after 
the team's 30-29 loss Monday night to Cleveland that she sprayed them and a 
dozen innocent bystanders with Mace. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten to 15 people were squirted in the face," said Dr. Michael Brunko, who 
works in the first-aid room at the stadium during games. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was not charged in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In suburban Aurora, Colo., police arrested Bronco fan Lloyd Vincent Jenkins 
early Tuesday after a four-hour standoff at his home. Police said Jenkins had 
become so upset with the Bronco loss he first pointed a rifle at his wife, then 
fired the weapon in his back yard, setting up the standoff.

<P>
Last year, redshirt freshman Kevin Williams was projected as the UCLA tailback 
of the future. 
</P>
<P>
He led the team in touchdowns, with six, and in average yards per carry, with 
4.5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
However, Williams has been used sparingly this season because of ankle and back 
injuries, and was not in uniform for last Saturday's loss to Arizona at the 
Rose Bowl. Williams has carried the ball in only one game this season, gaining 
30 yards in 10 carries and scoring two short-yardage touchdowns during the 
Bruins' victory over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Brown has emerged as the No. 1 tailback. He averaged 114 yards a game 
rushing in the games against Washington State and Arizona. MAL FLORENCE

GRIFFIN HAS SURGERY, OUT FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tight end Frank Griffin underwent surgery Wednesday to repair a torn ligament 
in his left knee and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-4, 235-pound senior from Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, 
Calif., Griffin is tied for second among the Trojans with 12 receptions for 143 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, as a backup to Scott Galbraith, a two-time All-Pacific 10 
Conference selection, he caught 14 passes. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was injured near the end of Saturday's 30-17 victory over Washington 
State, when another player fell on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three weeks, he was just outstanding," Coach Larry Smith said of 
Griffin, whose blocking aided in the resurgence of USC's running game, which 
has produced 638 yards and eight touchdowns in the past two weeks. "It's such a 
loss because he was playing the best football of his career. He was on his way, 
I thought, to an all-conference type of year." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin will be replaced in the starting lineup by Yonnie Jackson, a 6-2, 
235-pound sophomore from Tokay High in Stockton who has caught five passes for 
51 yards. Brad Banta, a 6-5, 240-pound redshirt freshman from Baton Rouge, La., 
has moved up to No. 2 on the depth chart. JERRY CROWE

MILLER MAKING UP FOR SOME LOST TIME; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: BRUIN RECEIVER HAD A SLOW START BECAUSE OF INJURY, BUT HE IS MAKING A BIG 
IMPACT NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue calls him the team's best offensive player. Offensive 
coordinator Homer Smith says he's outstanding and calls him "Slinky." 
</P>
<P>
By any name, Bruin flanker Scott Miller is an impact player who can influence a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
He has played only two games for the Bruins since recovering from a collarbone 
broken three days into fall practice. Nonetheless, he has quickly made up for 
lost time. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first time Miller touched the ball after his injury, he returned a punt 
47 yards against Washington State to set up a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He caught three touchdown passes Saturday against Arizona at the Rose Bowl 
on plays of 40, 45 and 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has made seven catches for 219 yards, an average of 31.3 yards a 
reception. He is also averaging 25.5 yards a play including his punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That average would have been even higher if a 51-yard punt return for a 
touchdown against Arizona hadn't been nullified by a clipping penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Some comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big-time player," Donahue said. "He's a very accomplished wide 
receiver. I'm not sure he's not as good as any I've had at UCLA. He's much 
quicker than people think he is. He has good moves and good running ability 
after he catches the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also fiercely competitive and is probably as unselfish as any wide 
receiver that I've been around. He has absolutely no concern for how many 
passes he catches, or what position he plays. I'm just tremendously impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "We'll be watching him play for a long time (in the NFL). What he's 
got can't be measured in conventional measurements such as speed or height. He 
just has football savvy, and he gets it done in the face of competition. And 
he's deceptively fast." 
</P>
<P>
Why Slinky? 
</P>
<P>
"He just operates alone and is very quiet," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who stands 5 feet 11 and weighs 177 pounds, is one of the few junior 
college transfers on the team. He came to UCLA last season after playing at 
Saddleback College for two years. An accomplished wide receiver at El Toro High 
School on an unbeaten team in his senior year, he didn't quite have the grades 
or the SAT score to go to a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, doesn't regret going to Saddleback while his high school 
teammates, Bret Johnson, Scott Spalding and Cory Wayland went to UCLA 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked out for the best," Miller said. "It was something I had to do. By 
going there, I was able to mature and take care of my classes." 
</P>
<P>
Miller also observed that there are some community college players who are as 
skilled as ones he has played against while at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He said several schools, including USC, Ohio State, Washington and Houston, 
tried to recruit him at Saddleback, but he chose UCLA for its winning tradition 
and seven bowl victories in the 1980s. The prospect of being reunited with some 
of his El Toro teammates also influenced his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Miller caught 23 passes for 414 yards -- an 18-yard average -- and five 
touchdowns last year as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
His senior season didn't get off to an auspicious start, though. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in shorts, and I was just laying out for a ball in practice and came 
down on my shoulder," Miller said. "It was the first time I had broken a bone. 
I've landed on that shoulder a million times and didn't get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that it takes four to six weeks for a broken collarbone to mend. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was back in five weeks, after missing games against Oklahoma, Stanford 
and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard part of the injury was watching games and practices," he said. "I 
wanted to be out there, helping the team out." 
</P>
<P>
If UCLA had beaten Arizona, Miller would have been the featured player in 
almost every account of the game. As it was, Bruin mistakes were highlighted. 
</P>
<P>
Here, though, is a recap of his three scoring catches: 
</P>
<P>
No. 1, UCLA, 7-0 -- Miller said he ran a middle route and as soon as he caught 
Tommy Maddox's pass at the Arizona 21-yard line, he was hit by two defensive 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
"But they didn't wrap me up," he said. "If I they had, I would have been down 
right there." 
</P>
<P>
Miller angled across the field and was pursued and then tackled by cornerback 
Darryl Lewis in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2, UCLA, 14-7 -- "It was a play-action pass and Lewis bit down (was fooled) 
on the fake option," Miller said. He caught the ball at the Arizona seven-yard 
line with Lewis in futile pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3, UCLA, 21-14 -- "I ran what we call a 'freedom route,' just getting open 
on my own. The play was designed to get a first down on fourth and two." 
Instead, it got a touchdown. Lewis was burned again. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis got even, and then some, later when he intercepted Maddox's pass and ran 
70 yards for a touchdown with 50 seconds remaining for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Miller is supportive of Maddox, a redshirt freshman, saying: "He's going to be 
a great player here. He'll learn by his mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Miller caught passes from Johnson last year, as he had in high school. When 
Johnson learned that Jim Bonds would be the starting quarterback on the first 
day of fall practice -- before Maddox became No. 1 -- Johnson left school. He 
is enrolled at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real surprised," Miller said. "I had no idea why he wasn't at an 
afternoon practice. He didn't tell me." 
</P>
<P>
So the El Toro connection was broken. Johnson has to sit out a year before he 
is eligible to play for the Spartans. And Miller's season is off to a rousing, 
if belated, start.

ASSOCIATION WARY OF FTC COMPLAINT

<P>
Remember the name, James P. Timony. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative law judge has been assigned the case involving the Federal 
Trade Commission's complaint against the College Football Assn. and its new 
television contract with Capital Cities/ABC, which also owns ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC charges, among other things, that the CFA, which includes 63 Division 
I-A schools, and Capital Cities would partly control the number of college 
games seen on television and also act as an illegal cartel. If proved true, the 
CFA and Capital Cities will be in violation of antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the FTC, which conducted an 18-month investigation into the matter, 
says that if the new contract is allowed to stand, the CFA and Capital Cities 
will enjoy a monopolistic arrangement. The FTC wants the five-year, 
$300-million contract between the two organizations nullified. 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma City, the law firm of Crowe &amp; Dunlevy, recently retained by the 
CFA, prepares for a Nov. 13 pretrial conference with FTC officials and Timony. 
The trial, which could destroy the CFA as a major player in the television 
negotiation business, is scheduled to begin May 13, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very positive that our plan will be found legal," said Chuck Neinas, CFA 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Added Sam Jankovich, University of Miami athletic director: "Anybody who wishes 
the FTC wins that suit, there's something wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
The CFA contends that college football telecasts have increased, from 76 in 
1983 (the final year of the NCAA's ill-fated network contract), to 236 in 1988. 
That number includes national, regional, local and pay-per-view games. 
</P>
<P>
If the CFA contract is voided, the possible ramifications are many. For 
starters, the FTC also may file complaints against conferences that have 
negotiated exclusive deals with networks. Or, it could signal the beginning of 
an every-school-for-itself mentality, a la Notre Dame. One thing is sure: The 
CFA would be rendered virtually powerless. 
</P>
<P>
The absurd quote of the week comes from Colorado Coach Bill McCartney. 
McCartney's team squeaked past Missouri, 33-31, last Saturday, thanks to the 
ineptitude of seven on-field game officials, none of whom noticed that Colorado 
was granted a fifth down on the Tiger one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
With the extra down and two seconds remaining, Buffalo quarterback Charles 
Johnson scored the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later if he would consider forfeiting the victory, McCartney said: "If I 
felt like Missouri had out-played us under fair conditions and we were 
inadvertently given an extra play at the end, I'd have to meet with my squad 
and coaches and really search my heart to consider if we shouldn't forfeit the 
game. But I don't feel like that." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri had more first downs, 18-16; more yards passing, 326-151; and the same 
number of fumbles lost -- one. Colorado had the edge in rushing yardage, 
330-87; return yardage, 108-5; and time of possession, 33:41-26:19. If Missouri 
didn't outplay Colorado, it came close. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney also argued that the artificial turf at Missouri's Faurot Field was 
too slick and that Tiger players had an unfair advantage, since they knew how 
to play on the stuff without slipping. Huh? 
</P>
<P>
According to Jeff Bollig, information director of the Big Eight Conference, 
McCartney has never registered a complaint about the field's surface in years 
past. To use it as an excuse for keeping a tainted victory is shameful. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney, who speaks of restoring integrity and pride to Colorado football, 
had an opportunity to do the right thing. Instead, he took the cheap victory 
and hid behind slippery turf. 
</P>
<P>
The next NCAA convention isn't until January in Nashville, Tenn., but already 
there is talk of widespread changes in the business of football. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's Jankovich said cost-cutting measures probably will include a 
restructuring of coaching staffs, a 5% cut in the number of available 
scholarships and a reduction in the time and money spent on player recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
"We do think it's time to have some reform," Jankovich said. "We do think it's 
time to have some cost reduction." 
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of athletic dormitories and training tables, don't look for 
the athletic directors to be in such a compromising mood. They want the 
decision to have an athletic dormitory or training table left to the school. 
</P>
<P>
If Arkansas (2-2) loses any more, the Southeastern Conference may be tempted to 
change its mind and withdraw its invitation to the Razorbacks. The supposedly 
strong Arkansas team has lost to Mississippi and surprising Texas Christian, 
which is 4-1 overall and 2-0 in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Conference presidents passed a rule last week that will make partial 
academic qualifiers ineligible for athletics as long as they are in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
A partial qualifier is someone who has passed only one of two NCAA requirements 
-- at least a 700 SAT score or a 2.0 grade-point average in core curriculum 
courses. Under NCAA rules, that person is ineligible during the freshman season 
but can resume play for the remaining three years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents are having the rule checked by lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The famed "12th Man" kickoff unit at Texas A&amp;M finally failed. Formed eight 
seasons ago, the kickoff team includes walk-on players exclusively. It had 
never allowed a touchdown until Saturday, when Texas Tech's Rodney Blackshear 
returned a kickoff 92 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
If it's any consolation, Texas A&amp;M overcame a 13-7 halftime deficit and 
beat the Red Raiders, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
High-strung Miami Coach Dennis Erickson, a self-avowed Maalox addict, 
celebrated last Saturday's 31-22 victory over then-No. 2-ranked Florida State 
with an impromptu dance atop a locker room table. A month ago, Erickson had 
warned the Hurricanes that embarrassing displays of celebration would be 
grounds for benching. 
</P>
<P>
Since his own performance was done in the locker room, Erickson said he doesn't 
qualify for disciplinary action. However, several of his players suggested, 
Erickson might want to work on his moves. 
</P>
<P>
"The dance definitely wasn't 'Club MTV' material," Miami offensive tackle Mike 
Sullivan told the Miami Herald. "It had a little rhythm in it, though. A 
little." 
</P>
<P>
Coach David McWilliams of Texas has been accused of allowing too many of the 
state's blue-chip high school players to go to Oklahoma. The Sooners have 43 
players from Texas, 35 from Oklahoma. . . . Undefeated Georgia Tech hasn't 
allowed a touchdown in four games. . . . Don't be fooled by Indiana. The 
Hoosiers (4-0) have yet to play Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State and 
Illinois. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: BIG EAST CONFERENCE ADDS MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Miami, a football power trying to improve its basketball 
image, joined the Big East Conference on Wednesday and the conference 
commissioner says that probably saved the league. 
</P>
<P>
"To be very blunt with you, our future was at stake," Commissioner Mike 
Tranghese said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Big East and the University of Miami could not have gotten together, 
I'm not certain we had an answer that would have satisfied the football 
concerns of Pitt, Boston College and Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
There was fear that those schools would have joined Miami and others with 
Division I-A football programs to form an Eastern Seaboard conference. 
</P>
<P>
Miami will become the 10th Big East member beginning with the 1991-92 seasons 
in most sports. 
</P>
<P>
Miami football will stay on its own until it can work out a commitment with the 
three other Big East Division I-A members because the Big East does not compete 
as a conference in football.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PROBERT'S FIRST GOAL IS A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Detroit's Bob Probert picked a good time for his first goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 4:08 into overtime and capped a three-goal rally as the Red Wings 
defeated the Calgary Flames, 6-5, at Detroit Wednesday night for their first 
win under new Coach Bryan Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Burr had tied the game with 58 seconds left in regulation, and Probert 
flipped a 10-footer over Rick Wamsley's glove on Detroit's only shot in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, 3-1-0 under new coach Doug Risebrough, led, 5-3, until Lee Norwood 
beat Wamsley with a long slap shot with 2:39 remaining. The Red Wings pulled 
goaltender Tim Chevaldae with 1:08 to play and Burr tied the game 10 seconds 
later, deflecting Steve Chiasson's shot from the right circle behind Wamsley. 
</P>
<P>
Chevaldae preserved the tie with four saves in the overtime as the Red Wings 
killed the final 1:54 of a penalty to Chiasson. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings were 0-2-1 in their first three games under Murray, who was hired 
as coach and general manager after Detroit missed the playoffs last spring. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Washington 2 -- Darren Turcotte had two goals and an 
assist, including the tiebreaking short-handed goal at 10:47 of the third 
period, and Mike Richter made 40 saves in the Rangers' win over the Capitals at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Turcotte added an assist on John Ogrodnick's insurance goal 3 1/2 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals outshot the Rangers, 11-0, in the first five minutes and 42-17 for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dave Poulin scored the tiebreaking goal in the second 
period to lead the Bruins over the Jets at Winnipeg. It was the fourth 
consecutive win for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Christian, Peter Douris and Wes Walz also scored for the Bruins, who 
outshot the Jets, 33-30. Pat Elynuik and Danton Cole had goals for Winnipeg, 
1-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Buffalo 3 -- Kevin Dineen's goal with 7:42 left to play was the 
difference in the Whalers' victory over the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers, trailing, 3-2, entering the third period, tied the score on Ulf 
Samuelsson's goal at 6:16, then won it when Dineen, assisted by Ray Ferraro 
from behind the net, connected on a quick wrist shot near the left post. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Holik, Czechoslovakian rookie forward, and Randy Cunneyworth also scored 
for the Whalers (2-1-1). Christian Ruuttu, Alexander Mogilny and Rick Vaive 
scored for the Sabres, 0-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 8, Toronto 5 -- Tony McKegney and Joe Sakic each scored two goals to 
lead the Nordiques over the Maple Leafs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Sundin, Brian Fogarty, Mike Hough and Guy Lafleur also scored in Quebec's 
first win after two defeats and a tie to begin the new season. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Damphousse had two goals and Wendel Clark, Rob Ramage and Dave Hannan one 
each for the Leafs, who have struggled with four defeats to open the season.

CORWYN BAY BOOSTS STOCK WITH ANCIENT TITLE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though four of the first five winners of the Ancient Title Breeders' Cup 
Handicap went on to race in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, none of them repeated 
their success when $1 million was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Corwyn Bay just might be the thoroughbred to do what Groovy, Zany Tactics, 
Olympic Prospect and Sam Who couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
A month after winning his first start on the main track by 6 1/2 lengths, the 
4-year-old Caerleon colt dominated Sensational Star, Prospectors Gamble and 
four others Wednesday at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In winning for the sixth time in 13 starts, the 6-5 favorite defeated 
Sensational Star, winner of the Bing Crosby and Pat O'Brien stakes at Del Mar, 
by two lengths in 1:08 2/5 for six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
With Housebuster missing, the Sprint isn't coming up particularly strong, and 
Corwyn Bay has the added advantage of being a fresh horse. He has run only 
twice in 1990 after 11 starts as a 2- and 3-year-old in Europe. BOB MIESZERSKI

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: NACHOS SUGGESTED BUT SMILES ARE A MUST AT CASA FRANCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even the owners wait tables at Casa Franco, a little family-owned Mexican 
restaurant in Mission Viejo, making this place more homey than most. But no 
matter who waits on you, the service is virtually always accompanied by a 
friendly smile. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Franco, named after its original owner, is now owned by brothers Benjamin 
and Edgar Rojas. But not much else has changed. It's small and comfortably 
casual, with about 18 tables in all. Nothing fancy, but the food is good. 
</P>
<P>
Start off with an appetizer such as the nachos a la Franco -- tortilla chips 
topped with refried beans, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, melted cheese and 
a Tex-Mex sauce. For a main course, a good choice is the carne asada -- a lean 
New York-cut steak served with a side of guacamole and tortillas. It is one of 
the best plates the Casa Franco serves. 
</P>
<P>
Another tasty dish is the chimiflautas, oversize flour taquitos with either 
chicken or beef served alongside refried beans and Spanish rice. Casa Franco 
also serves seafood, prepared with cilantro, avocado and zesty salsas. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant offers tacos for 99 cents on Tuesday nights. And on Thursday 
nights, it's burritos for 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
And to wash down that inexpensive meal, try a wine margarita -- made with white 
wine instead of tequila. Then, if you still have room, go for a slice of mud 
pie, a rare treat in a Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
As you leave, don't forget to wave goodby to the Rojas brothers. And smile, 
always smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Franco, 24395 Alicia Parkway, Mission Viejo. Open Monday through Friday, 
11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. (Note: sometimes closes 
between 2:30 and 4:30 p.m.). (714) 380-9693.

"Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An 
Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit but gets 
one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among 
the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said 
to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. There's wit in the 
script: the alien turns out to be a vegetable, of all things. MARK CHALON SMITH

"Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Rated R. An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets' Society" and "Witness," 
this one is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish 
while on a school outing. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among 
the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that 
of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly 
receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an 
hour away. ERIK HAMILTON

RESTAURANTS: FILIPINO FARE WORTH FILLING UP ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON

<TEXT>
<P>
A great many food writers claim that the small ethnic restaurants cook circles 
around the bigger, better-financed competition. Tita Emma's, a modest Filipino 
storefront cafe in a Santa Ana mini-mall, makes a powerful argument in their 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant belongs to Emma Alcantara, who operates it along with her 
husband, Nick. Alcantara has been cooking since she was a small child in Vigan, 
Ilocos, one of the far northern islands in the Philippine archipelago. Last 
year, the Alcantaras opened a grocery store called Fil-Cal Foods, specializing 
in Filipino foods such as tamarind candy and spiced pork rinds. The restaurant, 
two doors down, opened soon after. 
</P>
<P>
Emma cooks up a storm and comforts homesick countrymen with an impressive 
variety of homey, hearty dishes. Her restaurant is a busy place, dominated by a 
large steam table that holds several colorful stews. It's short on atmosphere, 
but it's such a friendly place you won't care. 
</P>
<P>
You eat from plastic plates off glass-topped tables, while Filipino pop music 
plays aggressively in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Start your meal with quekiam, a long, sausage-like creation wrapped with a 
gossamer skin made from egg white. It's a soft, meaty pork roll that is cut 
into slices, and it reminds me of a fine French galantine, flecked with bits of 
carrot and leek that could as well be pistachio. Eat it with Emma's homemade 
banana ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
At the left side of the steam table are some sauteed, slightly crisped-up 
slices of milkfish and pompano with bones still in. There is also some 
barbecued sausage that the restaurant has made for them locally. The fish are 
flaky, delicate and tasty. You eat them with rice and they make a good light 
lunch. The sausage is more powerful, with the sweet, concentrated flavor of 
Chinese barbecued pork. It tastes best by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Now you are ready to choose from the stews, at least eight different ones that 
make up a crash course in Filipino cuisine. The most distinctive might just be 
pinakbet, an Ilocano delicacy of vegetables stewed with bitter melon. Bitter 
melon, known as ampalaya in the Philippines, is that vegetable that you see in 
the Oriental markets that looks like a cross between a cucumber and a horned 
toad. It has a bitter flavor that many people find an acquired taste. 
</P>
<P>
Here, you can eat pinakbet without fear. Emma chooses the bigger ampalaya, 
which are less bitter, and soaks them to reduce the bitterness. Then she mixes 
in okra, pumpkin, Chinese long bean and the magic ingredient, bagoongan, a 
salted shrimp paste with a rosy pink color. Voila. I'll never wrinkle my nose 
at the mention of this dish again. 
</P>
<P>
Another really unusual dish is munggo: minced pork, tomato, sauteed onion, 
garlic, and amaplaya in a light soup. It's delicious and not at all bitter. 
Afritada is more Western (the name comes from Spanish); it's a yellow-hued pork 
stew with tomato puree, pineapple, carrot and big chunks of potato. And then 
there is the better known kare-kare, eggplant, long bean and oxtail in a sauce 
thickened with peanut butter. It's a heavier dish than the rest, and 
deceptively filling. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, Nick and Emma prepare lechon, a whole roast suckling pig, and, 
from what I gather, Filipinos from all over come to eat pieces of it. They eat 
the skin with a sweet sauce made from pureed liver, served in a jar on their 
condiment tray. I really like this weird sauce, but I think if I had a million 
words, I wouldn't be able to describe the taste. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some far-out desserts, including the one thing that you 
absolutely cannot miss here, special halo-halo. This is a variety of fruits and 
confections served in a parfait glass with shaved ice, and Emma's is the most 
indulgent anywhere. It's crammed with a dense egg confection called leche flan, 
young coconut (buko), pearls of sago (made from the same plant as tapioca), 
corn, jackfruit, pineapple and gulaman, which are little cubes of cloud-colored 
jelly. And if this weren't enough, she snows the whole thing under in shaved 
ice and tops it with a radiant purple ice cream made from purple yams. 
</P>
<P>
Purple ice cream. Who'd ever imagine. The big restaurants must be positively 
green with envy. 
</P>
<P>
Tita Emma's is about as inexpensive as it gets. Lechon, the most expensive 
thing on the menu, is $3.95. One course and rice is $2.65. Two courses are 
$3.25. Three courses are $4.15.

SOUTHWEST MUSEUM'S DECISION TO MOVE IS BLASTED BY ALATORRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Richard Alatorre accused the board of the struggling Southwest 
Museum on Wednesday of being "a very close-knit group" that treats the museum 
as "their personal property" in pushing ahead with a plan to vacate its 
landmark Mt. Washington home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the museum's director said a seismic engineering study of the 
Southwest's dilapidated building confirmed that a reinforced concrete tower 
where most of its collection is stored has structural flaws that could risk the 
destruction of thousands of priceless artifacts in an earthquake. The study was 
done in 1987, however museum officials say it is further proof that they need 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre's comments came in the wake of a decision by the museum, disclosed 
Friday, to solicit proposals for a new site. 
</P>
<P>
The museum houses one of the nation's best collections of American Indian art 
and artifacts, but museum officials have said that the facility is in need of 
$2 million in deferred maintenance projects -- including replacement of a 
primitive elevator that carries visitors to the hillside museum from the street 
below. 
</P>
<P>
In an announcement Monday, the museum said it has "nothing specific in terms of 
time or place" for the move, "but decisions will be made relatively soon." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, whose district includes the museum and who has been deeply involved 
in museum affairs since 1987, was sharply critical of the abrupt decision by 
the museum board, which he said had been made without consulting community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
He said the museum decision appeared to ignore details of a pending master plan 
for northeast Los Angeles in which the Southwest Museum has been identified as 
the "cultural anchor" of the Mt. Washington-Highland Park area. Alatorre said 
plans for a light-rail line connecting Pasadena and downtown Los Angeles call 
for a station to be located in Highland Park near the museum. The museum has 
long suffered from an acute parking shortage and lack of freeway access. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre complained that the museum, which initiated imaginative programs under 
its previous director, Patrick Houlihan, has lost its momentum. Houlihan left 
in a dispute with the board over the pace of the rejuvenation in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's stagnant, at best," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is what have they done to outreach into the community and I 
say that they've done nothing," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
However, Alatorre ruled out the prospect of a city takeover of the museum 
facility or of financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the museum said it faces an operating loss. 
</P>
<P>
Museum Director Jerome Selmer said the museum does not have an up-to-date 
financial statement because it is in the process of changing the basis of its 
fiscal year. The museum has a 1990 budget of $1.3 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Alatorre's comments, Selmer said he and a member of the museum 
board had "discussed the entire situation" with the councilman before public 
disclosure of plans for the museum's future. 
</P>
<P>
Selmer said he did not know how to interpret Alatorre's statement that the 
museum had lost its momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Our membership is at an all-time high. Our attendance is at an all-time high. 
. . . All of these things are going on continually," Selmer said. "That's not 
something I'd call stagnant." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Selmer said the Southwest Museum retained a seismic 
engineer after the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake caused damage to some 
pottery in its collection. Sources said employees inside the building when the 
quake struck observed that the tower -- the Italianate museum's most familiar 
architectural feature to motorists on the nearby Pasadena Freeway -- had begun 
to separate from the main building. The tower was added after the main building 
was completed in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
The entire structure, Selmer said, is formed of massive, heavily reinforced 
concrete but the structural connection of the tower to the main building is 
primitive and comparatively weak. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering study found the entire structure safe for occupancy, Selmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that limited space in the tower -- which is used mainly for 
collection storage -- means that artifacts could be tossed around violently in 
a temblor, with the potential for massive damage to irreplaceable materials. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the present building and location have aesthetic and historic value," 
a museum announcement said, "the physical plant does not constitute the 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
The museum has some unreinforced brick interior walls, which made it subject to 
earthquake safety inspection laws passed after the 1987 temblor. However, the 
city Department of Building and Safety said it was not required to inspect the 
museum because of the private engineering study.

DAVE DISTEL: VARDELL KNEW WHAT TO DO IN SOUTH BEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old college football player walking onto the field at Notre Dame 
Stadium is like a baseball player coming out of a dugout in Yankee Stadium or a 
golfer standing on the first tee at St. Andrews or a priest entering St. 
Peter's. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a stadium as much as it's a shrine. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't who is there now but rather who has been there. 
</P>
<P>
No football player, no matter how young, has gotten through high school and 
into college without hearing of legends such as Rockne and Gipp. They are as 
real in South Bend as the Golden Dome. 
</P>
<P>
Onto this turf strode an athlete named Touchdown Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
What a name. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
Square jaw. Wide shoulders. Powerful legs. Strong heart. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood would take one look at this guy, cast him opposite Brooke Shields and 
wait for the cash registers to go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is almost as if Touchdown Tommy was some fantasy character. He just 
couldn't be real. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be something like "The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant." Our hero 
would have to take an underdog to the promised land and probably walk off with 
a fair maiden. 
</P>
<P>
You want a story line? 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy and a bunch of his pals from a private school out west come to 
Notre Dame as conservative 18-point underdogs. Naturally, Notre Dame would be 
unbeaten and ranked No. 1 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The stands would be filled with 59,075 pilgrims to this shrine, all of whom 
fully expected the Fighting Irish to roll onward to bigger showdowns against 
bigger foes. 
</P>
<P>
However . . . 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy would punch over from the one-yard line for first one and then 
two and then three and finally four touchdowns, the last coming with 31 seconds 
to play. The Irish would lose, 36-31. 
</P>
<P>
End of unbeaten season. 
</P>
<P>
Also, end of fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy was a very real nightmare for the Fighting Irish last Saturday. 
He did, indeed, score four touchdowns to lead the visiting Stanford Cardinal to 
a rather gigantic 36-31 upset that will be remembered in Palo Alto long after 
they will wish they could forget it in South Bend. 
</P>
<P>
To get more specific with the reality of this thing, Touchdown Tommy is Tommy 
Vardell. He spent his high school days doing the same thing in far less 
auspicious places for Granite Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Like many local youngsters who choose to pursue their college careers 
elsewhere, Vardell has suffered a bit from the "out-of-sight, out-of-mind" 
syndrome. He was doing quite well at Stanford, thank you, but he had become 
almost as anonymous hereabouts as the 47th entry on page 211 of the telephone 
book. 
</P>
<P>
They know him in Palo Alto . . . and South Bend. 
</P>
<P>
Those touchdowns against Notre Dame were his eighth, ninth, 10th and 11th. 
Eight of them have come from the one-yard line. The others were cross-country 
jaunts from the three, five and eight. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder his teammates took to calling him Touchdown Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
As his coach, Dennis Green, said: "You know he's going to get the ball, they 
know he's going to get the ball, now let's see you stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
When Notre Dame is involved, you just don't say stuff like that. You go to 
Notre Dame, and you have to run through 11 defenders and about 11,000 ghosts. 
Nobody scores four touchdowns against the Irish. Teams don't score four 
touchdowns against the Irish. No one had this year and only one, Air Force, did 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame itself does not know if any individual has ever run through its 
defense for four touchdowns. It does know Anthony Davis scored six for USC in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to nail down four or five," said John Heisler, Notre 
Dame's sports information director. "We've checked records back to 1980, and it 
hadn't happened. I'd say the odds are probably good it's never happened." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the odds are probably good that someone scored four touchdowns in one 
afternoon against the Irish, but let's just say that Touchdown Tommy cannot 
have too much company among ballcarriers who have gone to South Bend to battle 
those ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe Notre Dame can feel a little better that it did not get knocked off 
its pedestal by any Dick or Harry or even plain old Tom. 
</P>
<P>
An institution so steeped in its legends and myths and heroes has to feel a 
little more comfortable losing to someone named Touchdown Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
In South Bend, he's a fit.

BERNSTINE WANTS BALL OR A TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rod Bernstine, a No. 1 draft choice in 1987, said Monday he is fed up with his 
limited playing time and would like to be traded if the Chargers aren't willing 
to give him more opportunities to carry the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be agreeable to a trade now," Bernstine said. "It's not benefiting me to 
stay here on the sideline. I'm not getting any younger. If I was going out and 
not gaining any yards, dropping balls or something, where I didn't deserve to 
play, I would sit over there without a gripe in the world. But I'm not doing 
any of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine, 25, a running back who has averaged 4.9 yards in 27 carries this 
season, has been criticized in the past for not being durable and for being an 
ineffective blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Bernstine's situation, Coach Dan Henning said: "If you want to have 
the job, be the best. He's not the best. Marion (Butts) is." 
</P>
<P>
Originally drafted out of Texas A&amp;M as a tight end, Bernstine was switched 
to running back during the off-season. He said limited action didn't bother him 
during exhibition season, but it does now. 
</P>
<P>
"It slowly wears on you when you get in for a couple of plays and you think you 
do a decent job and then you don't get the ball," he said. "That kind of stuff 
would have anybody discouraged. It's definitely not fun." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday is the NFL's trading deadline, but Charger General Manager Bobby 
Beathard said there is no chance Bernstine will be shipped out. 
</P>
<P>
"No possibility," Beathard said. "We recognize the talent, and we recognize 
that he's a threat when he has the ball. It's our job to get him the ball 
either as a runner or receiver. He's got to touch the ball a lot if we're going 
to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine had surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament late in the 1988 
season. He played only five games last season, starting none. He isn't hot 
trade bait because of a belief around the NFL that he doesn't have the 
endurance to be used in a full-time capacity. Bernstine doesn't agree with 
that, and he also disputes the knock on his blocking. 
</P>
<P>
"Something always is there that I can't do," he said. "They never talk about 
the positive, but it's always something like I can't block. I'm too big not to 
be able to block, so that's not true. If you can't block, why would you be a 
No. 1 draft choice?" 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of his durability, he said: "I haven't asked to carry the ball 
25 or 30 times a game, but I wouldn't mind carrying it 10 or 15 times. I'd just 
like to get in the ballgame and play a little while. You know, good backs can't 
just go in, run one play and run off the field. You've got to get into the flow 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers use four running backs: Butts, Bernstine, Ronnie Harmon and Darrin 
Nelson. Of the four, Butts in the only one who has played on a consistent 
basis, 79 times for 384 yards. Harmon has carried 10 times for 46 yards, Nelson 
twice for nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
Alternating running backs has its advantages. It eliminates late-game fatigue. 
But Bernstine says it also makes it impossible to build continuity. 
</P>
<P>
"If you only carry the ball three times, you're fresh as a daisy," he said. 
"That's being a little too fresh."

WHO'S NO. 1? HEY, IT'S SDSU'S AREY! 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's top receiver sat on the bench outside of the San Diego State 
locker room trying to sort it all out. 
</P>
<P>
Since the latest NCAA statistics came out Sunday, Dennis Arey has spent the 
week feeling like a guy who just found out the prettiest girl in school has a 
crush on him. 
</P>
<P>
He's thrilled. He's trying to figure out how it happened. He's a little 
embarrassed by all of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked in the mirror the other day and thought that people probably look at 
me and say, 'Damn, that kid plays receiver? Him?' " Arey said. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging 115.20 receiving yards a game, which makes him the nation's top 
pass receiver and the Aztecs' leading joke receiver. 
</P>
<P>
He sat there, attempting to downplay his current status, but that lasted as 
long as it took before a teammate walked by. Then he would receive some 
sarcastic comment, handle it almost as smoothly as he catches a Dan McGwire 
pass, then downplay some more. And another teammate would walk by. 
</P>
<P>
And so on. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1," offensive lineman Nick Subis said. 
</P>
<P>
Arey smiled. He looked down. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys like that," Arey said. "He shows it is due to everyone. He's giving Dan 
time to throw, Dan throws the ball, and Patrick (Rowe) and I are just catching 
it." 
</P>
<P>
This is Arey's first defense. Deflect some of his accomplishment to his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Then someone else walked by. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember my autograph," freshman receiver Curtis Shearer said. 
</P>
<P>
"See?" Arey said. 
</P>
<P>
He flashed a smile, and you thought maybe he would be perfect playing the lead 
in a school play. 
</P>
<P>
 That kid plays receiver? Him? 
</P>
<P>
 Him. That's A-R-E-Y. He's a senior, 5-feet-11, 185 pounds, from Fountain 
Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
You look at his numbers. He is sixth in the nation and fourth in the Western 
Athletic Conference with an average of six receptions a game. Last week against 
Wyoming, he became only the third SDSU player to put together four consecutive 
games of 100 or more yards receiving. It was the best game of his career: eight 
catches, 171 yards, three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He leads the team with 31 receptions. Entering the 1990 season, he had only 33 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
That explains why not everybody is giving Arey a hard time when they find out 
he is leading the nation's receivers in yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
"He is?" Coach Al Luginbill asked. "I don't get wrapped up in statistics. . . . 
That's neat for our football team and university that Dennis has that." 
</P>
<P>
Arey takes football seriously, works hard and runs his routes with pinpoint 
accuracy. That, and that he is quicker than he looks, makes him a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people underestimate Dennis' speed," Luginbill said. "He's fast enough 
to play anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a great awareness of the passing game. He knows where the ball is going 
to be thrown, and he's learned to come back to the football. He's got excellent 
feet and agility and a great work habit, too." 
</P>
<P>
Said McGwire, Arey's roommate: "He's a hard worker and a great learner. He 
always wants to learn how to run the right routes against different coverages. 
He's always asking CJ (receivers coach Curtis Johnson) how, why. . . . He's 
great. I can go out Saturday and have extreme confidence that I know where he's 
going to be." 
</P>
<P>
As in SDSU's 48-18 victory against Air Force two Saturdays ago. With no score 
in the first quarter, McGwire and Arey hooked up for a 71-yard touchdown pass. 
Arey was not the primary receiver; he was just running a clear-out route down 
the left sideline. But McGwire looked Arey's way and saw that Arey had given 
the slip to his defender and was wide open. Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of the hard work he's done has paid off," McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Arey is relaxed this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been happy," Arey said. "I think that's the biggest thing. It's my senior 
year." While Arey has been at SDSU, since 1986, luck has sometimes been tougher 
on him than an opposing cornerback. He redshirted in 1986, then missed most of 
the 1987 season because of a stomach virus. He played in 1988, mostly in a 
back-up role, and he finally cracked the starting lineup in 1989 -- and missed 
three games with a hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the most part, life is first downs and touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has turned around for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Everything, that is, except the team's success. The Aztecs have struggled 
early, getting off to a 2-3 start. The offense is starting to fire on all 
cylinders, but the defense has been another story. Arey goes out, gets his 100 
yards receiving a game, contributes quite a bit to an offense that is averaging 
38 points a game . . . and then watches the defense give up 39. 
</P>
<P>
The Wyoming game, the best of Arey's career, was a 52-51 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great game, but we lost," Arey said simply. "And I contributed." 
</P>
<P>
He and Patrick Rowe miscommunicated on a kickoff, fumbled and turned the ball 
over to Wyoming in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys went 17 yards for the 
go-ahead touchdown and a 45-38 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Aztecs and their leading receiver face a trip to the Rose Bowl to meet 
UCLA this week. Arey hasn't said much about this week's game. Memories of last 
year's 28-25 UCLA victory still burn in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was my most depressing time," said Arey, who caught five passes 
for 88 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed, 28-25, with 1:23 left and had a fourth-and-10 on UCLA's 47. 
McGwire threw an out pass to Arey for what would have been a first down . . . 
but Arey caught it out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't drag my feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that was it. UCLA got the ball back and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he and SDSU will get another chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told us, if we win, it will heal a lot of wounds," Arey said. 
"Especially this one for me, personally. I proved a lot to myself when we 
played against them last year." 
</P>
<P>
Until Saturday, there will be jokes. Someone will ask him something, and he 
won't hear it, and next thing he knows, that person will be telling him, 'Oh, 
you're No. 1. You won't talk to me.' Or, in the middle of a conversation with 
someone, that person will suddenly say something like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm talking 
to the number one receiver.' " 
</P>
<P>
Arey takes it in stride, but deep down, it bothers him a little. He's a 
friendly kid, not a cocky superstar. He's like your favorite old next-door 
neighbor who wanted nothing more on a Saturday than a game of catch. Now, all 
he wants is to be an important part of a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
So he practices, and gets ready for UCLA, knowing he could fall a few notches 
on the NCAA chart after any game. He and fellow receiver Jimmy Raye continue to 
dig up sports trivia questions to stump Johnson, something they started a few 
days ago. It's an ongoing rivalry between the coach and his receivers, and 
Johnson claims he's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
For Arey, it's all part of keeping things in perspective. His ranking is like a 
good book -- something to be put away, with care, until some cloudy winter's 
day when he has time to pull it out and enjoy it. Right now, he would like a 
few more victories. He knows that eventually, he will be the answer to an SDSU 
trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
He just doesn't want that question to be: Who led the nation in yards receiving 
per game for just one week in 1990 on a losing team? 
</P>
<P>
AREY IT OUT

SPANOS DENIES HBO REPORT ON HENNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charger owner Alex Spanos angrily denied a television report that said he had 
been talked out of firing Coach Dan Henning by General Manager Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of bull . . . ," Spanos said before Wednesday's practice. "I don't 
want any more questions. I don't want to even talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Myers, a New York Daily News sports columnist, said on HBO's Inside the 
NFL that a source close to the Chargers told him Spanos was very upset with 
Henning after the team's 17-7 loss to Houston at home Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Myers' remarks were taped Tuesday in Kansas City and shown for the first time 
Wednesday evening on HBO. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said Spanos wanted Henning relieved of duties but was stopped by 
Beathard. He went on to speculate that if the team lost to the Jets Sunday in 
New York, Henning might very well be the first head coach in the NFL to be 
fired this season. 
</P>
<P>
Myers' comment was passed on to USA Today by HBO's public relations department 
in an effort to hype the show and published Wednesday morning. Beathard said he 
saw Myers' comments in the paper and immediately called him. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me there was nothing to it, and he said he told the same thing to Dan 
Henning," Myers said. "I can only tell you what I've been told. This is one of 
those 'stake your life on it' kind of sources." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he has spoken with Spanos about the Chargers' 1-4 start, "but 
honest to God," he said, "It has never been mentioned. (Henning's firing) has 
absolutely never been brought up. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing Mr. Spanos said is that everybody is frustrated and what can we 
do. He said, 'God, I just want this guy to do well.' He was very supportive of 
Dan. He said, 'Hey, you make the decisions; I'm not even going to be involved 
in this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Spanos conceded Wednesday that his reputation for being an impatient boss in 
the past might have lent credibility to the report. But he said, "I've got the 
best organization I've had in seven years, and I've got Bobby Beathard, and 
he's calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Henning is in the second of a five-year contract and has a 7-14 mark as the 
Chargers' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"You know me well enough to know I'm really disappointed in what's happened so 
far," Spanos said. "We're all disappointed, but we're going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: 
</P>
<P>
Wide receivers Nate Lewis (thigh) and Walter Wilson (ankle) are doubtful for 
Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Wilson says his leg is still stiff, 
but he expects to be back soon. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Vencie Glenn (sprained ankle) won't practice much this week but is 
expected to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Ronnie Harmon suffered a concussion in Sunday's game in a 
collision with Steeler kick returner Rod Woodson. Harmon says he is fine and 
won't miss any practice. "I lost my memory for about 30 seconds and that was 
it," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers activated defensive end Gerald Robinson off injured reserve 
Wednesday and waived safety Michael Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been short over there," Henning said. "Right now because we're up to 
snuff in the defensive backfield. We brought in Brooks for the two-game period 
to try to take up for the slack of Vencie being hurt. We need more work with 
the big guys up front so we made that move." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he wasn't yet sure whether Robinson would play against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have installed curtains over the shower area in the locker room to 
give the players more privacy in response to the recent controversy surrounding 
female reporters in the locker room.

PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS;

<P>
LEUZINGER READY TO GIVE FOES A SAMPLE OF A HEALTHY LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heading into Bay League play, Leuzinger High football Coach Steve Carnes says 
his team is right where he wanted it to be at the halfway point. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, I expected us to be 3-2 and I wanted to be healthy," he said. "I 
think we're both. I know we're 3-2." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the Olympians have no significant injuries for the first time 
since early last season. All of Leuzinger's best players will be suited up 
Friday night for a league opener at Culver City (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
That includes senior tailback B-Jon Sample. 
</P>
<P>
When last seen carrying a football, Sample was making a cut against Santa 
Monica when his knee gave way. It came in the final league game of 1989. The 
injury robbed the Olympians of their leading rusher for the playoffs and put 
Sample's football career in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
He underwent surgery in April and there were doubts if he would ever play 
again, at least at Leuzinger. His name was not included in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept saying he was going to play, but I didn't think he was going to play," 
Carnes said. "All of a sudden, here he is." 
</P>
<P>
Sample was cleared to play last week by doctors and will see duty for the first 
time Friday night. He has practiced for several weeks and looked good in a 
scrimmage Tuesday, Carnes said. 
</P>
<P>
"B-Jon won't start, but he's going to get in there quite a bit," Carnes said. 
"He gives us really good quickness at tailback." 
</P>
<P>
Before his injury last year, Sample had established himself as one of the 
area's most explosive backs. He rushed for 924 yards and eight touchdowns on 
104 carries, an average of 8.9 yards per carry. Of the returning backs in the 
area, only Robert Coulter of Rolling Hills rushed for more yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
Sample's return allows Carnes to move Marvin Johnson, Leuzinger's leading 
rusher with 450 yards and seven touchdowns, from tailback to fullback, where 
the coach feels he is more effective. 
</P>
<P>
Another key player returning to the lineup for Leuzinger is senior Manny 
Gonzalez. The all-area linebacker missed four games after suffering a broken 
hand in the team's opener against Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
With Gonzalez, who also plays fullback, Sample, Johnson and Manny's brother and 
tailback Charlie Gonzalez, the Olympians have four quality running backs 
entering their most important games. 
</P>
<P>
By sharing the load, Carnes hopes to give Johnson and the Gonzalezes more time 
to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking to get our best 11 people on defense," he said. "I don't think 
we've done that up to now." 
</P>
<P>
Following are three coaches' views of the Bay, Ocean and Pioneer league 
football races, which begin this week: 
</P>
<P>
Carnes, on the Bay League: "Obviously Hawthorne is the favorite. They're the 
team to beat. Santa Monica is always good. The league is tough again. If you 
have a letdown, you'll get beat. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Coach Gary Kimbrell, on the Ocean League: "The league is pretty 
tough all the way down the line. I wasn't overly impressed with Redondo in the 
summer, but you don't see their big kids. Geez, they're playing really tough on 
defense and they have a balanced offense. Mira Costa looks physical. I picked 
Palos Verdes as the best team to begin with. And there's Morningside. You have 
to be ready every week." 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance Co-Coach Mark Knox, on the Pioneer League: "I think it's going to 
be real close. North is coming on. Poor South has lost some real close ones. 
They're a couple of points away from having a real good season. I think you 
might have a little bit of a break against Centennial, but all of the Torrance 
schools match up across the league pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Our predictions: 
</P>
<P>
Bay League -- 1. Hawthorne; 2. Leuzinger; 3. Santa Monica; 4. Beverly Hills; 5. 
Culver City; 6. Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean League -- 1. Rolling Hills; 2. Redondo; 3. Palos Verdes; 4. Morningside; 
5. Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer League -- 1. West Torrance; 2. Torrance; 3. South; 4. North; 5. 
Centennial. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, the West co-coach, said he will be looking for an improved effort from 
the offensive line when the Warriors (4-1) face South (1-4) in an Ocean League 
opener Friday night at West. 
</P>
<P>
West was held to a season-low 139 yards rushing last week in a 9-7 victory over 
Redondo. Knox said the line, which had been playing well to that point, was 
partly to blame for the poor production. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think we blocked very well," he said. "It was probably the most 
disappointing game for the offensive line. You have to give Redondo credit; 
they did a good job. But I think we have to be a little more intense. We were 
taking things for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hendrix, a 6-foot-6 forward for Rolling Hills, has given an oral 
commitment to play basketball for Utah State. He averaged 24 points and nine 
rebounds last season. . . . Robin Ortgiesen of Mira Costa was named to the 
all-tournament team last weekend at the San Marcos Invitational girls' 
volleyball tournament at UC Santa Barbara. Corona del Mar won the team title to 
solidify its No. 1 ranking in the CIF-Southern Section 5-A Division coaches' 
poll. Mira Costa slipped from fourth to seventh. . . . Agoura and Palos Verdes, 
the nation's second- and third-ranked girls' cross-country teams by Harrier 
magazine, met Saturday at the Kenny Staub Invitational at Crescenta Valley 
Park, with Agoura defeating the defending state Division I champions for the 
second time this season, 19-38. . . . Israel Pose of Torrance turned in the 
best time Saturday at the Fountain Valley-Huntington Beach cross-country meet. 
Pose covered the three-mile course at Central Park in Fountain Valley in 15 
minutes, 21 seconds to win the Division II individual title. . . . Three South 
Bay teams are ranked in the Southern Section 4-A Division girls' tennis top 10 
-- Palos Verdes (No. 1), Miraleste (No. 5) and Rolling Hills (No. 6).

Sophomore: 5-foot-7, 145 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of players who excel on the undefeated Moorpark College 
soccer team, but Coach Frank Parodi says that Billy Kranz stands out from the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel he's really the spark plug and the mainstay," Parodi said. 
</P>
<P>
"On the field, he's magic. He's not quick, but he's explosive." 
</P>
<P>
The team's leading scorer, Kranz had a goal nine days ago in a 3-0 win over 
Bakersfield, a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win Friday against Oxnard and two 
assists Tuesday in a 9-2 trouncing of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (10-0-0, 5-0-0 in Western State Conference play) has allowed only 
seven goals all season, but the Raiders had to play about 20 minutes without a 
banged-up Kranz in a match against Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when he went in, boom, things just changed," Parodi said.

ARCHITECTURE: IRVING GILL'S MARSTON HOUSE TO OPEN SOON AS A MUSEUM 
</P>

<P>
Fans of architect Irving Gill wince each time they drive by 6th Avenue and 
Redwood Street. On the site where one of Gill's finest designs was completed in 
1907 -- the Klauber house -- a 10-story, 36-unit condominium tower now stands. 
</P>
<P>
Other Gill houses have met similar fates. His 1911 house for the Timken family 
at 4th Avenue and Walnut, an example of Gill's minimal, modern style, was 
replaced during the 1970s by offices. Newspaper chain heiress Ellen Browning 
Scripps' 1915 home was a La Jolla coastal landmark for years and eventually 
became home to the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, but it was covered up 
when the museum expanded during the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-bedroom, five-bath, 8,500-square-foot 1905 house Gill designed for 
George White and Anna Gunn Marston on 7th Avenue near Balboa Park remains as 
the grandest survivor of the architect's San Diego legacy (he also designed 
houses in Los Angeles and on the East Coast). 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly three years after Mary Gilman Marston, George's daughter, left the 
house to the city of San Diego, restoration is well under way. After a grand 
opening for the public on Oct. 21, the Marston house will be open to the public 
as a museum every Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Marston house is important in Gill's career," said Bruce 
Kamerling, a San Diego Historical Society curator who is writing the definitive 
biography on Gill and overseeing the refurbishing of the house. "It was kind of 
a turning point in his move toward a more modern point in architecture. Though 
basically English Cottage in style, he simplified the design and introduced 
innovations that later became trademarks." 
</P>
<P>
With its steep shingle roof, broad eaves and clean-lined stucco-and-brick 
exterior, the house shows Gill in transition between earlier, more elaborate 
designs rooted in the Victorian era and his signature modern style. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Gill's work was revolutionary. In 1907, his stark, flat-roofed stucco 
box of a house for Russell Allen was completed in Bonita, a year before 
Austrian architect Adolf Loos helped launch the modern movement with the 
proclamation that "ornament is crime." 
</P>
<P>
Gill's earliest drawings for the Marstons depict a house covered with 
English-style half timbering. But after construction began, he changed 
important details. Kamerling believes the turning point came when Gill visited 
Chicago during trips east to visit clients while he was working on the Marston 
house. 
</P>
<P>
During the early 1890s, Gill and Frank Lloyd Wright both had worked at the same 
time for architect Louis Sullivan in Chicago. Kamerling surmises that when Gill 
returned to the Windy City early in the new century, he undoubtedly saw the 
long, low Prairie-style houses being designed by Wright and others. 
</P>
<P>
Back in San Diego, he modernized the Marston house -- most noticeably, he did 
away with the half-timbering, giving the exterior a much simpler appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Along with ties to the Midwestern Prairie style, the Marston House also is one 
of San Diego's finest remaining examples of the Craftsman style, which is known 
for simple, solid construction using brick, wood, stone and other natural 
materials. The Marston house proves Gill an equal to such famous Craftsman-era 
architects as Greene &amp; Greene in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly modern bathrooms reveal Gill's obsession with sanitation. Claw-foot 
tubs encased in a pale reddish material called magnesite were sleek and easy to 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
Bathroom floors slope upward slightly to form a sill beneath doors, which 
prevented water from flowing into the hallway. Bathroom walls and floors meet 
in a gentle, seamless curve designed to keep out insects. 
</P>
<P>
Clutter is minimized by built-in cabinets, shelving, pocket doors and bench 
seats beneath windows. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Craftsman philosophy, as espoused by proponents like designer 
Gustav Stickley in The Craftsman magazine, was a return to nature, which meant 
fresh air and lots of natural light. 
</P>
<P>
Gill liked to greet visitors with natural light. At the Marston house, a long, 
wide central hallway, with rich redwood beams and paneling, gives a clear view 
from the entry to French doors at the back of the house. These pull in natural 
light and frame views of the garden beyond. Gill's floor plan for the house is 
a pleasant departure from stuffy Victorian designs and was an early relative of 
today's casual, open plans. 
</P>
<P>
Gill paid careful attention to details. In the dining room, quarter-sawed oak 
paneling has a rich, swirling pattern. Gill used neat little "butterfly" 
inserts to hold together horizontal wood wainscoting in the living room. He 
beveled the front edges of bookshelves to give them a light, graceful 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Many rooms are stunning, but much work remains before the restoration will be 
complete, both cosmetic repairs and the acquisition of furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Several rooms have been furnished with simple Craftsman-era pieces acquired 
with Kamerling's guidance, but other rooms remain virtually bare. Historical 
society member Grayson Boehm willed the historical society $50,000 when she 
died a year ago, to be used for living room furniture. Kamerling hopes to 
acquire several pieces designed by Stickley and his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
The exterior of the house also needs repairs. The city, which maintains the 
outside of the house and adjacent grounds, is long overdue on its promise to 
re-roof. Kamerling hopes the work will be completed in time to protect the 
interior from winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
While Wright, Sullivan, Loos and others are mentioned again and again in 
architecture books, Gill seldom receives credit as a pioneering modernist. 
Although the Marston house is not from his mature modern period, over the long 
haul, the Marston house should serve as a landmark attraction that will help 
earn Gill the national respect he has long deserved. 
</P>
<P>
Even before his death in 1936, Gill was revered by those few who had taken time 
to study his work. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for Irving Gill in California, who created out of radical 
simplification of Spanish Colonial design a modern treatment of poured concrete 
construction for houses, (Frank Lloyd) Wright has been the only modern 
architect of consequence of the first quarter of the century in America," 
renowned architectural historian Henry Russell Hitchcock wrote in 1934. 
</P>
<P>

FIRST PERSON: ONE MOTHER'S QUEST TO COMFORT CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My daughter, Rachel, just had her second birthday. She wore sunglasses and 
delighted in her pink nail polish and pralines and cream ice cream cake. I 
suffered a mild case of mother guilt for trimming her bangs too short before 
the party pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, I wish I had been able to believe that one day I would be 
getting a sticky birthday hug from my little girl. At the time, I hardly felt 
like her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Born with a rare, hereditary skin disorder called epidermolytic hyperkeratosis 
(I couldn't pronounce it then, much less spell it), I barely got to see Rachel 
on that hot July day in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
She was a month premature, and I had complications late in pregnancy -- a 
frightening contrast to the giddy, exhilarating and completely normal birth of 
my son two years before. This time, I had wanted a girl. 
</P>
<P>
The initial joy in the delivery room was broken too fast by the sounds of 
Rachel's screeching, alarming cries and the measured, jargoned professionalism 
of doctors and nurses who knew there was a problem. I met my baby's deep blue 
eyes, for a moment, before she was hurried into the nursery. Midway through my 
Cesarean, I only vaguely knew things were not right. I assumed her prematurity 
required special care. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the situation was critical. Everywhere the pediatrician touched her, 
the waxy, vernix coating that encased Rachel tore, ripping her skin. Her 
plastic identification bracelet badly cut her ankle; huge red swaths on her 
head showed where doctors lifted her from my womb. 
</P>
<P>
My first good look at Rachel was through the window of an incubator in the 
hallway outside the recovery room; two critical-care nurses and the director of 
the newborn intensive care unit at Burbank's St. Joseph Medical Center had come 
to pick her up via ambulance. My husband, David, and I looked inside at our 
tiny, wounded baby, helpless. 
</P>
<P>
And then she was gone. 
</P>
<P>
I was wheeled to my room at Verdugo Hills Hospital, ostensibly to recover from 
what suddenly seemed more like surgery than birth. Nurses from St. Joseph 
called me with reports: she had an IV and was getting Demerol for her pain; she 
finally could stop crying and doze fitfully. They took Polaroid photographs so 
I could study her face. 
</P>
<P>
The professional lactation consultant for Verdugo Hills Hospital, Carol Ann 
Friedman, came to my room to see if I wanted to try to save my milk for Rachel. 
A mother herself, with a son close in age to my boy at home, Carol Ann pulled a 
chair up to my bed to talk. She was sympathetic but practical. Here was 
something I might be able to do for Rachel, at least for a while, she 
explained. At the very least, an electrical breast pump could collect my 
colostrum, the clear, antibody-rich substance babies receive in the first few 
days of life. Carol Ann assured me it would be given to the nurses caring for 
Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
I said yes, I wanted to use the pump, but that my real desire was to someday 
nurse her, if I could. After a rocky start, I had successfully breast-fed my 
son, Bobby. I had come to know him that way, nestled in the crook of my arm. As 
he grew, I felt nursing had comforted him when he was frightened or suffered 
the rare pain of an earache or a bumped head. Perhaps, I thought, there would 
come a day when nursing would comfort Rachel, who would suffer pain every day. 
</P>
<P>
While the mother in the next room cradled her baby boy to breast-feed, I used 
the pump every two hours, even awakening during the night to connect myself to 
the machine. Despite my efforts, there wasn't much colostrum: a few drops here, 
a half-ounce there. Even at this, I felt I was failing. Carol Ann appeared 
every day in my room, assuring me that I was not. Every drop was like gold to 
an infant, she said, with protective immunities to disease that I had built up 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these were bleak days. I called my parents in Colorado and could not 
form words. I burst into tears when a well-meaning volunteer came to record the 
baby's name. My husband spent most hours watching over Rachel at the other 
hospital, and I could tell he was trying to spare me details during her bad 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after my C-section, my understanding doctor allowed David to take me 
on a pass to the other hospital to see our baby. The wheelchair ride and the 
trip in the car, the mandatory scrubbing and gowning at the NICU, the talk with 
Rachel's doctors, wore me out. But I did get to see her, sleeping and drugged, 
in the corner incubator. She was huge compared with the other silent preemies: 
6 pounds, 9 ounces, her skin slightly golden and shining from salve, her lips 
pursed in a perfect "O." We could reach our gloved fingers through a sleeve in 
the incubator to touch her. Her skin felt warm. I was frightened I would hurt 
her. She looked angelic, but she did not seem to be mine. 
</P>
<P>
David and I sang lullabies and cooed assurances onto a cassette recording, 
which we left in the incubator for the nurses to play whenever Rachel awakened. 
</P>
<P>
For the next few days, I returned on the wheelchair journey and we spoke with 
nurses and doctors and the social worker of bilirubin levels, Demerol doses, 
new wounds, healing places, hereditary patterns. Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis 
is inherited, and Rachel had acquired the trait from my husband, whose infancy 
also was traumatic. In the disease, the skin cells do not pass correctly up 
through the skin layers, and are not shed easily once they do finally reach the 
surface. Babies typically lose their skin too easily; when anything touches it, 
the top layers peel away. The skin develops blisters. Whereas normal people 
would lose microscopic skin cells in the course of a day as they are replaced 
by healthy skin cells, people with EK have areas, particularly around their 
joints, where the skin tightly adheres to the surface, in effect locking them 
into their skin. Topical medications help regulate the skin flow, but it still 
must be scraped away with pumice stones. Infections are common, and both the 
medications and the scraping treatments are painful, especially for babies with 
sensitive skin. In some people, the condition improves with age, especially 
around adolescence. In others, it can be debilitating. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel's case was never as severe as children we had read about, some of whom 
are badly disfigured. But we faced with her a future of infections, anguishing 
daily treatments and the burden of a lifelong condition doctors rarely see and 
do not understand. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in those early days we were coming to know Rachel as a child 
who would grow from being stoic to cheerfully resilient, a doll-like, 
round-faced girl who would love lullabies and Raffi songs. Her first smiles 
would be from cotton cocoons we wrapped around her to keep her warm. It would 
be nearly a year before she could wear clothing, but by her second birthday, 
she would be able to dance and do somersaults. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, I couldn't envision a future with Rachel. I felt overwhelming 
sadness for this baby, but I didn't feel maternal. A reporter by trade, I still 
felt detached, like I was on a disturbing assignment. 
</P>
<P>
I continued to pump my milk. It was six days before we could hold Rachel on 
pillows on our laps, for short times. She was always sleepy, and would not 
nurse. Maybe it would be best to stop trying, one nurse said gently; she 
doesn't have to be held when she gets a bottle, and that might cause her less 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering colicky nights when my son, Bobby, was comforted by nursing, and 
longing to give Rachel some protection, I persisted. Every time I could hold 
Rachel, I tried to nurse, whispering to her in the busy, clinical ICU, turning 
my back to the monitors and bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
My pediatrician, Dennis Stobie, understood. After a long, tearful phone call 
about nursing and a dozen other worries, he arranged for the lactation 
consultant, Carol Ann, to work with me in the NICU. 
</P>
<P>
She arrived in the afternoon of a very bad day. The NICU doctors were huddled 
in a conference about another baby's insurance and closed the unit to parents 
for so long that David had to go to work without seeing Rachel. Rachel then 
underwent blood tests to check for infections, and I watched her endure a 
painful bath. I was aching and discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
A smile on her face, Carol Ann entered the NICU at 3:30 p.m., balancing an 
armload of sterilized pillows. She fawned over Rachel in her transparent 
incubator bubble. Then she studied every chair, chose one, and set me up in it 
with so many pillows I looked like the Pillsbury dough mom. A nurse helped 
place Rachel delicately next to me, her head in the palm of my hand, her 
fragile body lying along my side. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked at the cool air outside her incubator and the unfamiliar position, 
Rachel opened her mouth to scream in protest. At that moment, Carol Ann lifted 
the pillow holding her head and pressed her open mouth onto my breast. Rachel 
nursed. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, I did not feel helpless. Watching her baby gulps, I let 
myself feel joy for the first time that I had helped create a new little life. 
There were things to be done: tiny toes to admire, baby sounds to smile at. 
There would be, someday, candles on birthday cakes for Rachel to blow out. 
</P>
<P>
I looked up to Carol Ann and two favorite nurses, whose eyes were shining with 
tears. Of course, I cried a little, too. I was, after all, this bright and 
beautiful baby's mother. 
</P>
<P>
The only person in our cluster in that stark white world who was not crying was 
Rachel. Secure, her tummy full, Rachel had fallen asleep.

BABIES: LACTATION SPECIALISTS PIONEER A NEW HEALTH-CARE FIELD, OFFERING MOMS 
ADVICE ON HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAST-FEED RELUCTANT INFANTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lidia Abbasi of Reseda cradled her dozing, 3-day-old baby and sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have seen us this morning," she said. "She was screaming and I was 
crying. I'm just worried she's not getting enough milk." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Ellen Petok, a certified lactation consultant called in by the staff at 
AMI Tarzana Regional Medical Center. As Abbasi spoke, Petok nodded 
sympathetically, then donned a white medical gown and set to her task of making 
breast-feeding work. 
</P>
<P>
Trained lactation consultants are pioneers in a relatively new health-care 
field aimed at helping mothers who don't know where to turn when breast-feeding 
problems arise. Petok, an actress before she took two years of lactation 
training at UCLA, is one of about half a dozen lactation consultants in private 
practice in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Petok explained to Abbasi that she was not alone; many mothers of premature 
babies such as the 4-pound, 12-ounce Larissa have difficulties nursing at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes later, after an examination of the baby's suckling reflexes, 
repositioning of pillows, baby and mother, and four unsuccessful attempts to 
nurse, Lidia breast-fed her daughter. Throughout the process, tiny Larissa 
squeaked a pathetic, frustrated cry, or groggily moaned at being awakened. 
Finally, exhausted, she began to drink her mother's milk in quiet, measured 
gulps. 
</P>
<P>
This was not breast-feeding as shown on the covers of paperbacks on parenting, 
where the blissful mother is always dressed in white lace, and the baby is 
inevitably plump and happy. 
</P>
<P>
"They say breast-feeding is the most natural thing," Abbasi said, laughing. 
"Look at me. I've got a machine, a lactation consultant and four hands trying 
to make this work. Really natural." 
</P>
<P>
Problems with breast-feeding were practically unheard of during the 1950s 
because breast-feeding was practically unheard of: Fewer than 5% of American 
mothers nursed their babies. A large turnaround occurred after the American 
Academy of Pediatrics in 1979 stated that, ideally, all infants should be 
breast-fed for the first four to six months of life because of the nutritional 
and protective qualities in human milk that cannot be duplicated in formula. In 
California, 85% of babies are breast-fed, compared to slightly more than 50% 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
When women were abruptly told that breast-feeding was better for their babies 
than bottle-feeding, it was assumed that women instinctively knew how to 
breast-feed, said Carol Ann Friedman, a certified lactation consultant. But 
lactation can be a complicated process, dependent on many structures and 
functions working properly in both mother and baby. And while scientific 
studies proliferated documenting benefits of the properties of breast milk -- 
medical journal studies show that breast-fed babies suffer fewer respiratory 
and ear infections, and are less prone to allergies and digestive disorders -- 
few researchers looked at the problems in the breast-feeding process until very 
recently, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
"People think breast-feeding is natural, which it is. Suckling is a natural 
reflex," Friedman said. "What is not natural -- a learned skill -- is how to 
put the baby onto the breast." 
</P>
<P>
Before there were lactation consultants, modern experts who understood all of 
the components of the complex breast-feeding equation were hard to find, 
Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical schools teach little or nothing about breast-feeding, said obstetrician 
Steven Hartford of Glendale. "They teach the structure and function of the 
breast but absolutely nothing about the interaction between mother and baby." 
Most of Hartford's knowledge about the problems of breast-feeding came when his 
wife nursed their children, not through his professional training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank pediatrician Kenneth Stoller said he learned about breast-feeding 
during his residency because the hospital's nutritionist was a lactation 
consultant. Although Stoller said he often can diagnose the problem when 
breast-feeding isn't going well, he prefers to refer patients to a 
breast-feeding consultant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a really busy pediatrician, I may know what to do, but I don't have the 
time to do the hand-holding and the encouragement a mother needs to keep 
going," Stoller said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harold Maller, a Van Nuys pediatrician, said he often sends patients to 
Petok because of the results she achieves. 
</P>
<P>
"She teaches babies good techniques: Many babies just don't breast-feed well at 
all without someone to give them lessons," Maller said. "She also is very good 
at straightening out all sorts of bad advice moms have been given by friends or 
family, even doctors and nurses who really don't know what they're talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The lactation consultant movement was started in the mid-1970s by people who 
sensed the need for training based on scientific knowledge that went beyond the 
emotional and practical support offered by lay groups such as La Leche League. 
In Encino, Chele Marmet and Ellen Shell founded the Lactation Institute and 
Breastfeeding Clinic in 1977, and today draw nurses, doctors and therapists 
from around the world who want to know more about the basics of breast-feeding 
or more difficult subjects -- how to teach adoptive mothers to nurse, how to 
help babies with Down's syndrome, cleft palates or cleft lips. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, lactation consultants have also been trained and certified through 
the UCLA Extension. Petok was an early graduate, as was Lois Marquis, a nurse 
who developed an interest in lactation problems when she had difficulty nursing 
her own baby 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman received training in both programs, which, like a handful of others 
around the country, sought feedback from their graduates as they developed 
curricula for the new allied health field of lactation consultation. 
</P>
<P>
The International Lactation Consultant Assn. was established in 1984, and 
examinations were given to consultants who wanted to become board certified 
through the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners, beginning in 
1985. They now number more than 1,500 nationally and undergo years of training 
in the physiology, chemistry and physics of lactation. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Petok, who recently opened an office in Woodland Hills, went into 
private practice. Friedman, a registered nurse, worked in obstetricians' and 
pediatricians' offices at first, then went on to attain medical staff 
privileges at Verdugo Hills Hospital, and now has a private practice in 
Glendale. Marquis, a mother of three, has always worked out of her home in 
Sherman Oaks, although she, like the others, makes house calls and consults in 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The lactation consultants said they are hard-pressed to define a typical day. 
Usually, they spend a few hours each week teaching pregnant women what to 
expect from breast-feeding, and how to avoid trouble. Then a phone call from a 
distraught mother or a concerned pediatrician will prompt a consultation, 
usually lasting two hours or more, in which they ask detailed questions about 
the nursing problem, examine mother and baby and watch the infant nurse. The 
most common cases involve mothers with sore, bleeding or inverted nipples, 
babies who have trouble sucking or lack the coordination to latch properly onto 
the breast, and newborns who are not gaining enough weight. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes problems are complex: Stephanie Akers Cohen of Van Nuys went to 
Marquis to rent a breast pump when her daughter was 3 weeks old, crying 
constantly and gaining no weight. She had tried supplementing baby Georgina's 
feedings with formula, and using a pacifier to soothe her, but nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was freaking out," Akers Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Marquis found that the baby had a weak suck, and taught Akers Cohen how to 
exercise her baby by having her suck on a finger placed on the roof of the 
baby's mouth. She also helped her sort out the baby's hunger cries from the 
screams of colic. Soon the baby was sucking more efficiently and thereby 
triggering the production of more milk. 
</P>
<P>
"She started gaining weight and eventually outgrew the colic, and I finally 
relaxed," said Akers Cohen, whose baby is now a healthy 6-month-old. "I'm so 
glad that we just stuck it out." 
</P>
<P>
Marquis said she considers the case one of her nicer success stories, although 
working through Akers Cohen's problems took quite a bit of time. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to really see it as a passion more than a job," she said. "When 
people need to see you, it's a crisis. You can get consumed by it, seeing 
patients six days a week, having them call you at two in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a new, relatively unknown profession and insurance companies only 
reimburse about half the time, Petok said trying to break into the field of 
lactation consultation is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part for me is the business aspect," Marquis said. "I am not a 
businesswoman. Most nurses are nurturers, and it's really hard for someone like 
me to say, well, now it's time to get reimbursed." 
</P>
<P>
The average rate for a breast-feeding consultation is between $50 and $60 per 
session, with home and hospital visits costing about $30 more. But lactation 
consultants say each paid consultation is usually followed by hours of 
unreimbursed telephone advice to the new mother. Providing rental electrical 
breast pumps, which is supposed to help offset the costs of the business, 
becomes time-consuming because consultants end up giving mini-consultations to 
women who need help with the pumps or the logistics of collecting milk for a 
baby's later use, Marquis said. (Electric pumps rent for between $1 and $2 a 
day, depending on how long a mother wants to use them.) 
</P>
<P>
Friedman saw patients for free for a year while she tried to establish her 
reputation and hone her skills. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into hospital work was most challenging, Friedman said, because she 
had to gain the trust and respect of doctors, and even more important, nurses 
in maternity wards. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they would welcome me with open arms," she said. "What nurse has an 
hour to spend with a new mom who is having breast-feeding problems, and what 
nurse has this kind of training in lactation?" 
</P>
<P>
But even though she was a nurse, Friedman found herself as the "outsider, the 
unknown." Sometimes mothers would call her after hospital consultations, 
confused because a nurse had contradicted everything Friedman had just told 
her. One nurse didn't speak to Friedman for a year after Friedman insisted that 
the staff stop trying to feed a troubled baby by bottle until a program of 
exercises and regular breast-feeding had been tried. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, though, barriers are being broken. Friedman said she recently 
chalked up a victory when 38 nurses from Verdugo Hills Hospital enrolled for a 
course she is teaching on breast-feeding techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some lactation consultants have faced criticism from another corner: 
the minority of well-meaning but untrained breast-feeding advocates who believe 
formula is akin to poison and want to believe every problem can be solved by 
what Marquis called "marathon nursing." 
</P>
<P>
All three lactation consultants agreed that there are times, albeit rare, when 
babies must be supplemented by formula feedings because mothers cannot produce 
enough milk, or their infants, for some developmental reason, cannot consume 
enough to grow and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
More often, mothers who could breast-feed ultimately give up, frustrated by 
their nursing difficulties and facing pressure from families who urge them to 
choose the "easier" alternative of bottle-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
Lactation consultants count such cases among their failures, particularly when 
the mother had a strong desire to nurse. 
</P>
<P>
But for every such memory, there are many more success stories, Petok said. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, she recalled the case of a mother who initially decided not to 
nurse her premature baby who had Down's syndrome, but changed her mind later, 
after her milk had dried up. By using a nursing supplementer that fit around 
the mother's neck, Petok was able to ensure that the baby received nourishment 
from formula while stimulating the mother's breasts to produce milk, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"After nursing for the first time, the baby pulled away and just smiled," Petok 
said. "Those are the kinds of intimate and intense times that I realize why I 
love this work so much."

PERSONAL TRAGEDY PUTS HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR ON A NEW PATH; 
</P>
<P>
DISABILITIES: NANCY NIGHTINGALE HOPES TO CREATE A ROLE THAT WILL LEAD TO 
IMPROVED CATASTROPHIC ASSISTANCE FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

"It's a mother's nightmare. I always thought that if something happened to one 
of my kids, it would crack me up," said Nancy Nightingale, hospital 
administrator at the 321-bed Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Something did happen -- the Wednesday afternoon before Thanksgiving five years 
ago, when Nightingale's only daughter, Jennifer, was driving home from Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo, where she was studying architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the feel of the day," the 46-year-old Nightingale said. "It was 
clear and breezy, with a sense of excitement in the air. I was so happy about 
Thanksgiving, and seeing Jennifer, and we were going to go see 'Cats' on Friday 
to celebrate her 20th birthday." 
</P>
<P>
But the phone was ringing as Nightingale walked into her condominium with her 
youngest son, Mike, 21. It was Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara: Her daughter 
had been in a car accident, and she was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Nightingale remembers how the neurosurgeon went through the list of injuries on 
the telephone, the fractured pelvis and ribs, the diffuse brain injury with 
brain stem involvement, the internal bleeding, the respirator. Nightingale 
remembers that the physicians didn't think Jennifer would make it through the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know if I'd have the courage to see her," Nightingale said. "And when 
I did, there was blood and glass still on her face; she was so fragile they 
didn't dare clean her up." 
</P>
<P>
For three months, Jennifer was in a coma, and Nightingale spent days and nights 
by her side, reading to her, talking to her, telling her to just try to hear 
her mother and to understand. She walked the city of Santa Barbara, talking 
into a tape recorder, recording her comments on the sights and sounds of the 
street, the kids running in the park, the weather -- and then she played the 
tapes to Jennifer in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, Jennifer got better. When she finally came home she had to learn to 
crawl, to walk, to write. Today, at 24, she lives in an apartment with a 
roommate and takes two classes at Pasadena City College. She is physically 
disabled and has problems with her short-term memory, but said Nightingale, 
she's doing well. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer's accident was the start of a new phase in Nightingale's life, an 
experience that she said has given her unusual insight into the plight of 
families involved in catastrophic illness. 
</P>
<P>
"The daughter I knew is not still alive," Nightingale said. "I have a new 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer today has different needs, different goals and a different future, 
Nightingale said. And, she said, families who experience such tragedy need to 
know that they must grieve for the person they knew and loved before they can 
fully accept the changes, challenges and disabilities that may be associated 
with survival. 
</P>
<P>
As a hospital administrator and registered nurse, Nightingale is determined to 
do something to help others deal better with hospitals, health care providers 
and tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 1/2 years in the Kaiser system as a nurse and staff development 
instructor, and 5 1/2 years as hospital administrator, Nightingale is leaving 
her job this month. 
</P>
<P>
She saved vacation time and socked away savings for a six-month leave of 
absence, during which she hopes to create a role -- perhaps a combination of 
putting her thoughts in writing and speaking to health professionals, she said 
-- that will improve the quality of catastrophic care given to patients and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
She is giving up a job that few women have, a career that she worked hard to 
achieve. According to the Hospital Council of Southern California, there are 
only 14 women hospital administrators in the 167 hospitals in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Nightingale was a candy-striper in Upland and Chino when she was in high 
school, and she graduated from Chaffey Community College at 19. Married soon 
afterward, she wanted to expand her horizons, and entered Cal State Los 
Angeles. She became pregnant; after giving birth to a son, Patrick, now 26, a 
month early, she studied for finals sitting on the floor with him in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
After separating from her husband, Nightingale went to work at Kaiser 
Permanente Hospital in Fontana. With four children now -- including Matthew, 
now 22 -- she took care of them during the day and worked an 8 p.m. to midnight 
shift at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She moved up to in-service teaching and eventually was assigned a special 
project in administration when an assistant hospital administrator left. 
Nightingale liked it so much she decided to get a degree in hospital 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
In her early 30s, broke and now divorced, she got a bachelor's degree in 
nursing while working four nights a week. Although she had no money for 
graduate school, she talked her way into Loma Linda University, signing a 
series of notes and loans until she qualified for a scholarship. For the year 
and a half she was in graduate school, she continued to work as an assistant in 
hospital administration, studying and caring for the household of children in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
"I never learned how to keep everything separate," she said, explaining that 
she sees the work force differently as a result of her long juggling act as a 
single working parent going to school. 
</P>
<P>
Nightingale's success through tough times has also given her high expectations 
for others. "Necessity caused me to stretch, but I learned we can all do far 
more than we even think we can do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by comments from colleagues at Kaiser in Panorama City -- who call her 
"wonderful" -- her style is effective. For example, Tracy Schmidt, an assistant 
administrator there, said one of Nightingale's strengths is that "she's willing 
to take risks with people." 
</P>
<P>
That same desire to stretch, Nightingale said, is why she's leaving Kaiser. She 
said her combination of circumstances -- being a nurse, a hospital 
administrator and part of a family that has suffered catastrophic injury -- is 
so unusual that she feels compelled to do something with it. 
</P>
<P>
She said the health-care establishment ignores a family's greatest area of 
expertise -- its intimate knowledge of the patient. Doctors and nurses will be 
with the patients for weeks or months, but family members, she said, will be 
with them for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
She wants to promote greater respect for families' input and encourage their 
involvement in health care, and believes hospitals should equip families to 
support patients from the moment they are admitted to a hospital. "I was the 
one with the lifetime commitment to Jennifer," she said, "not the doctors and 
the nurses." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Nightingale was forced to deal with tragedy again. Mike, now 21, 
who was with her when she learned of Jennifer's accident, fell from a 
three-story building while he was posted in the Aleutian Islands with the U.S. 
Coast Guard. His back was seriously injured, and Nightingale flew to Anchorage 
to see him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very angry that I had to sit in another ICU. I was angry that I knew 
what to do, what to bring, whom to call, because I had done it all before," 
Nightingale said. Mike has recovered -- he can walk -- but he is also disabled. 
</P>
<P>
She has gotten married again, to Arthur Roscoe, 53, whom she met while Jennifer 
was still in a coma, and married about 13 months after her daughter's accident. 
They live in Porter Ranch; he works for Unisys International, selling large 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Nightingale and Jennifer never used those two tickets to "Cats" the Friday 
after Jennifer's accident. But a year later, Nightingale, Jennifer and Roscoe 
sat down together to see the show. Jennifer, just relearning to talk, was 
thrilled to be there. In the middle of a song, Nightingale stopped and stared 
at Jennifer in disbelief. Jennifer was singing the words to the song, words she 
had heard before the accident, that no one thought she would ever sing again. 
</P>
<P>
Nightingale said Jennifer noticed her mother was staring at her. "Am I 
bothering you?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nightingale replied, "No, no, you're not."

RED TAPE SNAGS GREEN CROSS STATUE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARKS: THE MONUMENT HAS KNOWN BOTH FAME AND OBLIVION SINCE IT WAS DEDICATED 
62 YEARS AGO. NOW ITS RESTORATION HAS ENCOUNTERED A SETBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Her face is scarred and her arms are gone. She can no longer stand up without 
help. She spent years lost and neglected in an obscure Brand Park canyon, where 
vandals took potshots at her and the elements eroded her features. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendale officials say better days are ahead for Miss American Green Cross, 
a 62-year-old statue that was erected amid great fanfare by American Green 
Cross, a now-defunct organization committed to saving the nation's forests. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders say the statue has historic value, and they plan to spend 
thousands of dollars to restore her arms, refinish her bronze skin, rebuild her 
pedestal and put her back on public display. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the project remains strong, but the restoration of Miss American 
Green Cross suffered a slight setback last month. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale parks officials had chosen for the project local sculptor Ron Pekar, 
who said he could complete the work by November for $25,000. He said he would 
use modern materials that are more durable and vandal-resistant than the 
concrete-like substance originally used to form the cross behind the statue and 
the cluster of logs at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
But the Glendale Historic Preservation Commission gave the proposal a cool 
reception at its Sept. 17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission prefers to see it restored to its original condition in both 
materials and design," Commissioner William E. Dodson said. "We're to protect 
what is historic in the city and try to retain it as much as possible in its 
original condition. 
</P>
<P>
"To do less, you're really not restoring, you're creating something new. We 
wouldn't have Miss American Green Cross. We'd have a new project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A further complication arose shortly before the meeting, when a Glendale 
history buff unearthed some old photos of the statue at the Los Angeles 
Library. They showed that it originally stood upon a six-foot-high base, with 
inscriptions proclaiming the importance of forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it was a surprise to us," said Nello Iacono, the city's parks and 
recreation director. "We had never seen that base." 
</P>
<P>
Artist Pekar suggested that the mammoth base, if rebuilt, would dwarf the 
delicate five-foot-tall statue and detract from her beauty. Its size would also 
spoil a plan to put the statue in a small landscaped area near the Brand 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
But the Historic Preservation Commission urged that the large base be rebuilt 
because it was part of the original monument. "It's not so much the artistic 
quality. It's the history behind it that's important," Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Iacono has asked Pekar to draw up a new budget and schedule for rebuilding the 
base and restoring the statue with original materials. The new budget is 
expected to be higher and the project may not be completed until next spring, 
the parks director said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson is not worried about the delay. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is not of the essence here," he said. "The quality is more important than 
the time element." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was briefly the center of civic attention, time has not been kind 
to Miss American Green Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cheering onlookers attended her unveiling at the Glendale High 
School campus on April 23, 1928. On May 4, California's governor at the time, 
C. C. Young, placed a strongbox filled with mementos in the monument's 
cornerstone after being escorted to the campus by a parade of more than 100 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was a focal point for American Green Cross, but little is known 
today about the organization. Glendale officials have been unable to find any 
chapters that still exist. 
</P>
<P>
According to old news articles, the group was founded in Southern California on 
Dec. 3, 1926, as a successor to the American Reforestation Assn. It promoted 
the conservation of timber and other natural resources. Its leaders said the 
destruction of forests, which absorb rain, had contributed to serious flooding 
problems nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
One early Green Cross committee chairman urged that the group's national 
headquarters be established in his hometown, Santa Barbara, "because there are 
so many people here who have time to think about the important things of life." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the headquarters was established in early 1928 at Glendale's Sparr 
Heights community center, which was donated to the group. On April 5, 1928, 
Glendale also became the site of the nation's first local Green Cross chapter. 
</P>
<P>
The organization made plans to place its first Green Cross monument at Glendale 
High School. Little is known about its sculptor, Frederick Willard Potter, or 
his model, Verlyn Sumner, although they were on the speakers' platform during 
the unveiling of Miss American Green Cross. 
</P>
<P>
A Times report on the event said, "The monument portrays America as a woman 
standing before a green cross with outstretched arms amid ruined stumps crying, 
'Help Save Our Trees.' " 
</P>
<P>
Beneath that plea was the inscription: "The Forest Is the Mother of the 
Rivers." Other conservation messages also appeared on the base. 
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, American Green Cross' popularity apparently waned, 
as did the city's enthusiasm for the statue. According to old news reports, art 
critics of the era dismissed the statue as "an abortion." One report said its 
base was damaged when "a wildly driven car banged into it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometime during the early 1930s, Miss American Green Cross was spirited away 
from the high school campus and deposited in the remote canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
She briefly re-entered the limelight in 1954, when reporters hiking in the 
Brand Park canyon stumbled upon the statue and dubbed it the mysterious "Green 
Cross Woman." The mystery was solved a few days later when the Glendale City 
Council, accompanied by civic activist Essie Morris Hughes, journeyed into the 
brush to inspect the find. 
</P>
<P>
"There's my statue!" exclaimed Hughes, who had founded the Junior Green Cross 
chapter for Glendale's schoolchildren many years earlier. Council members joked 
about who had removed the monument, "but not one suggestion was heard that she 
be returned to her place on Glendale High School grounds," the Glendale 
Independent reported. 
</P>
<P>
Miss American Green Cross remained in the canyon and was heavily damaged by 
vandals. Glendale's Historic Preservation Element, adopted in 1977, designated 
the statue as a landmark piece that should be relocated to a prominent place in 
Brand Park. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, her arms were gone, and her cross and logs had crumbled, 
parks director Iacono said. Since 1981, she has remained in storage at Brand 
Park's maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Historic Preservation Commission was formed to take a more 
aggressive role in saving important Glendale buildings and artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
During an Arbor Day speech last March, Iacono said the city's goal was to 
complete the monument's restoration by the end of the year, to coincide with 
the renovation of the park. He said the founders of American Green Cross were 
visionary and their message more timely than ever, in view of the current 
international concern over the loss of rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the restoration and permanent placement of Miss American Green Cross 
reaffirm our commitment to trees and the integral part they play in our 
environment," Iacono said.

SCHOOL AUTONOMY IS LIBERATING, FRUSTRATING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A NEW MANAGEMENT POLICY ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO SET SOME OF THEIR OWN 
PRIORITIES, SUCH AS GIVING TEACHERS INPUT ON HIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At Allesandro Elementary School, a new school district management policy means 
a chance to preserve a year-round schedule that teachers and parents adopted 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall High School, it means a chance to crack down on students who miss 
too many classes and to give parents and teachers more control over a $200,000 
campus budget. 
</P>
<P>
At Irving Junior High School, it means a chance to create a more personal 
school within a school for each grade. 
</P>
<P>
There are high hopes at five Northeast area schools in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District for "school-based management," which is supposed to give 
teachers, parents and communities more say in running schools. 
</P>
<P>
There is also some frustration. The road to autonomy, critics say, is paved 
with paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to actually deliver on what everybody thinks is possible to do, 
it's like, 'Wait a second. Get it down on paper. Is it rational? Is it safe?' " 
said David Tokofsky, who teaches government at Marshall. "We're caught between 
this goal of being able to self-determine our environment . . . and these 
constraints that say you have to do it a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
School restructuring was set in motion by teacher contract negotiations in May, 
1989. The Northeast area schools are among 70 allowed to propose changes on 
their campuses for the 1990-91 school year, even if the proposals clash with 
district policy or state law. Franklin High School and Arroyo Seco Alternative 
Magnet School are involved along with Allesandro, Irving and Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Only 38 schools submitted proposals by the July deadline. Of those, 27, 
including Marshall and Allesandro, saw their proposals largely approved in 
August by the Board of Education and United Teachers-Los Angeles officials. 
Proposals by 11 others -- including Arroyo Seco -- were returned for 
clarification. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, Irving and the 30 other schools that did not meet the initial 
deadline have until Oct. 24 to submit their proposals for approval, said Joe 
Rao, the district's director of school-based management. Arroyo Seco also must 
resubmit its proposal by that time, Rao said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools whose proposals are approved have until June to demonstrate goals for 
raising and measuring student achievement, a goal that must underlie any 
approved change. The schools also must explain how they will address ethnic and 
cultural diversity among students, Rao said. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall and Allesandro, changes already are under way. 
</P>
<P>
A student at Marshall, which is between Los Feliz and Silver Lake, cannot miss 
more than 20 days of class without losing credit and must make up the time if 
he or she misses 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are helping to hire teachers. Next semester they will visit one 
another's classes as part of peer evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Next week officials plan to eliminate the homeroom period, during which 
attendance is taken, and shorten the school day to give teachers more time to 
plan and consult with each other, said Barbara Knight, a counselor at Marshall 
and a UTLA member involved in the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes have been delayed, Knight said. Teachers and parents cannot take 
control of $200,000 in state funds for school improvements until state 
officials formally agree, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The district and union already have approved some proposals that clash with 
district or contract policies, and others may be granted within the next few 
weeks, Rao said. But those requiring state approval may not be decided until 
December or January, Rao said. 
</P>
<P>
At Allesandro, in Elysian Valley, officials are waiting for district OKs on two 
major proposals. 
</P>
<P>
One would maintain a trimester year-round schedule that its community 
voluntarily started in 1988, even though the school board has decided to put 
all schools on a semester year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The other would increase the school's control over its budgets. For instance, 
money for materials unspent in one year could be saved and used later. Schools 
now must return unused money to the district, said Lynn Andrews, Allesandro's 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are admittedly not radical. "We started out in sort of a 
conservative way," Andrews said. "If they would agree to us keeping monies they 
previously said we couldn't, and agree to a calendar they said we could not 
keep, then we knew we could ask for more far-reaching things in the future." 
</P>
<P>
School board member Jackie Goldberg, whose district includes Marshall and 
Allesandro, said she did not agree with some of the proposed changes but would 
approve them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm committed to school-based management, and if that's what they want, I 
imagine they can probably have it," Goldberg said. "The notion is that people 
on the campuses are the experts and the most vested." 
</P>
<P>
Parents at Irving Junior High School, in Glassell Park, will finish voting Oct. 
19 on their school's proposal. If approved, it will be submitted to the 
district later this month, said Al Powell, a social studies teacher and UTLA 
representative at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, seventh-, eighth- and ninth-graders would be grouped on the 
campus by grade levels, to create a smaller, more personal environment, Powell 
said. Teams of several teachers would be assigned to groups from each grade 
level and would emphasize themes that could be shared between their classes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One proposed reform already is in place at Irving. The regular schedule has 
been shortened, and classes including cartooning, archery and sign language now 
are taught at the end of the day. Although the change is included in Irving's 
restructuring proposal, school officials already have received the district's 
permission to put it in place, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin's proposal also will be submitted by Oct. 24 if it is approved by 
parents later this month, said Edward Rosas, principal of the Highland Park 
school. Like Marshall's, it would link student attendance to grades, involve 
teachers and parents in personnel evaluations and create local control of some 
money, Rosas said. 
</P>
<P>
At Arroyo Seco, in Highland Park, decision-making control already is shared. A 
committee of parents, teachers and students interviews administrators and 
teachers for hire, and a similar council advises the principal about curriculum 
and budgets, said Brian Metzger, an English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
But Arroyo Seco still will submit a proposal. School-based management is a 
"natural course to follow" at a school that historically has been progressive, 
Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making sure that as innovators in this we don't get left behind by 
missing this current train," he said.

TENNIS PLAYERS RETURN TO COURTS AFTER LANDFILL'S LEAKY GAS LINE IS REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Play resumed this week on tennis courts at the Scholl Canyon recreation complex 
in Glendale, following completion of a massive project to replace a faulty pipe 
system that had leaked noxious gas from the adjoining city landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis courts and an adjacent municipal golf course were shut down two 
years ago because of explosive levels of methane leaking from an inactive 
landfill beneath them. The city has since installed a new gas-collection system 
at a cost of about $750,000, said Kerry L. Morford, assistant public works 
director. The golf course remains closed for more work. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 tennis courts, restrooms and a reservations office were reopened Monday 
by three partners -- Michael Rinn, who supervises the city's adult team-tennis 
program; his wife, Catherine; and businessman Sarkis Miridjanian. They will 
operate the facility under a one-year contract with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The contract allows Rinn to operate the Scholl Canyon courts at 3800 E. 
Glenoaks Blvd., as well as four courts in Central Park at Louise and Colorado 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Rinn's proposal, selected from among five submitted to the city, is expected to 
provide about $33,000 a year in revenue to the city, said Nello Iacono, 
director of parks, recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
Iacono said closure of the Scholl Canyon courts two years ago caused severe 
overcrowding at the city's 25 other courts. "Tennis is one of the more popular 
sports in our city," said Iacono, who reported that a large number of players 
showed up on opening day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rinn said the courts will be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily for a fee of $2 
an hour weekdays and $4.50 an hour evenings and weekends. The facility has new 
nets and lights and the courts have been refinished, Rinn said. 
</P>
<P>
The Scholl Canyon tennis courts and adjoining golf course were closed in 
September, 1988, after officials found potentially explosive levels of methane 
building in electrical vaults and sewer manholes and leaking from earth 
fissures. Methane is given off by decomposing garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis courts are on solid ground next to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
However, the nine-hole, 1,700-yard municipal golf course, built atop the 
landfill, had been plagued with problems since before it opened in 1981. The 
slopes of the course shifted by as much as 15 feet, wrecking landscaping and 
breaking sprinkler systems. Golfers nicknamed the facility "Stinky Canyon" 
because of the constant foul odor of methane that burned brown holes in the 
grass, killed trees and caused occasional small bursts of flame. 
</P>
<P>
The new system uses flexible pipelines connected with seams that twist and bend 
with the constant movement in the landfill. Gas is collected in wells and 
pipelines and sucked to the adjacent active portion of the landfill where it is 
burned off in flares at a county Sanitations District facility. 
</P>
<P>
Morford said the new system is four times more efficient than the old system, 
which was built in 1983 with rigid plastic pipes that clogged and broke. 
</P>
<P>
City consultants said the movement and problems at Scholl are typical of 
landfills. However, the shifting has been particularly dramatic at Scholl 
because of the extreme depth of the canyon landfill -- up to 245 feet in some 
areas, according to Mandeville and Associates of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Morford said the new system has eliminated the foul odors near the tennis 
courts and clubhouse, although he said the city will have to give the system 
constant maintenance. "We are extremely pleased with this new system. It is 
doing the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is adding a six-foot layer of dirt to the landfill to provide a base 
on which to restore the golf course. More than 5,000 truckloads of dirt are 
being hauled to the site from nearby private subdivisions at no cost to the 
city, Morford said. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects that it will take at least two years to rebuild the golf 
course, Iacono said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is investigating ways to utilize the landfill's methane. 
Morford said the city is considering building a plant to convert the gas into 
electricity, similar to a program it had several years ago that was shut down 
by the South Coast Air Quality Management District because of excessive toxic 
and smog-inducing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
New technology could be used to build a plant without harmful emissions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is considering building a pipeline to carry the gas to the city's 
power plant where it could be used instead of natural gas.

DEVELOPMENT EDGES RENT CONTROL AS THE NO. 1 POLITICAL ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: A NEW AGE IS DAWNING, PITTING VOCAL PRO-DEVELOPMENT AND 
SLOW-GROWTH FACTIONS AGAINST EACH OTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Santa Monica, as City Council candidate Sharon Gilpin sees it, has lost its 
way. 
</P>
<P>
While pursuing the admirable goal of finding money to pay for an ambitious 
array of social services, she says, the progressive politicians who have been 
running the city have struck a "Faustian bargain" with developers. The city may 
get the money it needs, but the price is a steep one: Hotels, office and 
commercial developments are transforming the beach community into a congested 
urban center. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, says City Councilwoman Christine Reed. Responsible development, aside 
from providing urgently needed revenue, keeps the city vibrant, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Count on it: The election next month will usher in a new age in Santa Monica 
politics. A city long preoccupied with tenants' rights is moving on to other 
issues. And development has emerged as one of the big ones. 
</P>
<P>
Even Assemblyman Tom Hayden, who spent a good portion of the 1970s helping to 
organize the coalition of tenants that came to be known as Santa Monicans for 
Renters Rights and who dominated city politics through the 1980s, thinks it is 
time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I just believe that as rent control and SMRR dominated the '80s, the 
slow-growthers and the critics of development will dominate the '90s," Hayden, 
a Democrat who has represented Santa Monica in the Legislature since 1982, said 
in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 6, voters will be given the chance to approve or reject two ballot 
measures that would impose wide-ranging curbs on development. Development 
issues also figure heavily in the City Council elections, where nine candidates 
are running for three seats. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the most contentious issue of all: a third ballot measure in 
which voters will approve or reject a single project that in some respects has 
come to embody the entire citywide debate over development. 
</P>
<P>
The project is restaurateur Michael McCarty's proposed Santa Monica Beach Hotel 
and Community Center. McCarty wants to build a 160-room, $300-a-night luxury 
hotel on five acres of state-owned beach, where the private Sand and Sea Club 
operated until two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
To make the project more attractive to the city, McCarty proposes to include an 
$11-million community center, which would include facilities for art and 
environmental education; a public beach club and cafe; meeting rooms; a 
playground, and an underground parking facility. The project would generate an 
estimated $3 million a year for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over McCarty's project is said to have resulted in the costliest 
election campaign in the city's history. McCarty's side alone had poured more 
than $135,000 into it as of Sept. 30 and will probably spend considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, who in recent years has generally stayed aloof from contentious local 
issues, created a stir during the summer and early fall when he entered the 
fray. Hayden said he chose to take a stand against the McCarty hotel because it 
would be built right on the beach, and on state land that he says should be 
used in a more public way. Also, he said, he was frustrated. "After a time," he 
said, "enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has split the city's large liberal community. McCarty is a popular 
local figure who has been active in many philanthropic activities, and his 
supporters criticize Hayden for drawing the line on this particular project 
after having stayed out of earlier development squabbles. Where was Hayden, 
they ask, when four earlier hotels were being approved, or the huge commercial 
developments at the Water Garden and Colorado Place? 
</P>
<P>
Hayden acknowledges being a latecomer on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I also believe that while it is a fight worth fighting, that it is too late -- 
that it is a battle to salvage some beauty rather than enhance it," he said. 
"It requires very strong measures because you are dealing with a quality of 
life that is almost in eclipse. People are leaving for Seattle every day." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty, meanwhile, insists that the hotel and community center will have no 
serious adverse environmental impacts and notes that the project has been 
approved by all the necessary city agencies. But beyond that, he depicts it as 
a facility that will enhance the vitality of the city in much the way that the 
city's thriving Third Street Promenade has. 
</P>
<P>
On the ballot itself, the development issue is anything but simple. There are 
the three confusing and somewhat contradictory ballot measures -- Propositions 
S, T and Z, dealing with development in the city and on the beach. And there is 
also the City Council campaign, in which the candidates' attitudes toward 
development can be gauged in part by their positions on the ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
The candidate most on the spot is Christine Reed. As the only incumbent on the 
ballot, she is in the position of having to defend the decisions by a council 
majority to approve not only the McCarty project in August but other projects 
as well, including a massive and highly controversial commercial office 
development on city-owned land at Santa Monica Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The council backed down on pursuing the airport project in April, after it 
became clear that residents opposed to the development had collected enough 
signatures to force a referendum on it. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of attacks by her opponents, Reed insists that she is not 
"pro-development at all." 
</P>
<P>
"I am a pragmatic person who looks for compromise and reasonable solutions," 
Reed said. "I am one single (council) member. The development that has happened 
in this city that people are angry about did not happen because Chris Reed 
waved a wand." 
</P>
<P>
One of the activists who successfully opposed the city on the airport project 
was Sharon Gilpin. She is one of at least five council candidates who have made 
slow growth issues a major part of their platforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin and council candidates Kathleen Schwallie, Larry Jon Hobbs, Kelly Olsen 
and Jean Gebman oppose McCarty's hotel project. They say it will generate 
unacceptable increases in water usage, sewage flow and garbage, and will 
aggravate traffic congestion on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The same five candidates are united in support of Proposition S, an initiative 
that would sharply restrict beach development. If approved, Proposition S would 
ban future construction of hotels and large restaurants west of Ocean Avenue 
and would impose broad limitations on beach development. The five candidates 
say they support Proposition S as a way of putting on the brakes on rampant 
development and preserving beach access. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition T in many respects is a milder version of Proposition S. It would 
establish a three-year moratorium on development of beachfront hotels and large 
restaurants. It would also set aside 50% of hotel bed taxes from beachfront 
hotels for parks and cleanup of beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition T was originally sponsored to compete with Proposition S, as a way 
of protecting hotel projects developed by McCarty and by Maguire Thomas 
Partners, which is building the beachfront Santa Monica Ocean Hotel. But 
construction has started on the Maguire Thomas project, making it exempt from 
development curbs imposed by ballot measure, and the fate of McCarty's hotel 
now has been tied directly to Proposition Z. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition Z asks voters if the City Council's approval of the McCarty project 
should be repealed. McCarty fought hard for the essentially negative phrasing 
of the measure, which means that hotel supporters must vote no on the ballot, 
and opponents must vote yes. (Some observers say there is sufficient conflict 
between the various initiatives that the fate of the McCarty project may well 
end up having to be resolved in court, regardless of the election outcome.) 
</P>
<P>
Two council candidates, Reed and Donna Alvarez, support McCarty's hotel and 
urge a novote on Z. They say the hotel and community center constitute a fine 
example of the kind of responsible development that the city needs to raise 
revenues to fix up its beaches and coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the virtues of the McCarty project, the slow-growth candidates say, 
the time has come to apply the brakes. According to Gilpin, the City Council 
since 1984 has approved 5.8 million square feet of development, of which only 
20% has been completed. Among the major projects in the pipeline are the Water 
Garden, a 1.2-million-square-foot office development at 26th Street and Olympic 
Boulevard; a 1.3-million-square-foot addition to the nearby Colorado Place 
commercial development; and two more hotels near the beach, the Park Hyatt, now 
nearing completion at the end of Pico Boulevard, and Maguire Thomas' hotel on 
Ocean Avenue, where construction has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growth candidates cite some additional symptoms of overdevelopment: at 
least 75 intersections are at or near gridlock, and the city estimates that 
$171 million will be needed to alleviate traffic problems in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Schwallie, an attorney, says there is a "serious crisis in leadership" in Santa 
Monica. She said a pro-development council there has recklessly approved 
millions of square feet of commercial projects that have threatened the 
character of the city's neighborhoods as well as its coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome of the ballot measures regarding the beach hotel, the 
campaigns themselves already have underscored an increasing awareness of 
development issues by focusing on the City Council's record, say Hayden and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden said the council's approval of the McCarty project is a sure sign that 
the coalition that led Santa Monica through its rent-control revolution has 
taken an ill-advised, short-term view of development -- one that has sacrificed 
environmental issues for a quick solution to budget crunches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a sign of the progressive coalition being seduced by the promise 
of some spare change for beach cleanup," Hayden said. "I think it is 
grotesque." 
</P>
<P>
Though he does not blame members of Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, he said, 
Hayden implicitly criticized the four SMRR members on the City Council -- 
Dennis Zane, David B. Finkel, Kenneth Genser and Judy Abdo. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a built-in aspect of being a local elected official -- facing 
a fiscal crisis. . . . You want to meet your budget, you want to expand your 
social programs, but where do you look?" Hayden said. "About the only place you 
can look is fees from developers. And developers want their pound of flesh, and 
so you give it to them. And on it goes." 
</P>
<P>
SMRR co-chairman Brad Jones defended the tenants rights organization, saying 
that many in the group are staunch slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Jones noted that Zane, Finkel, Genser and Abdo often split on issues, and lose 
out to majorities headed by other council members. For example, only Abdo voted 
in favor of the McCarty project in August. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also pointed out that SMRR did not have a council majority from 1986 to 
1988, a period in which many of the large projects now being constructed were 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Assemblyman Hayden is misfiring a bit when he says that the 
progressives sold their souls to get money for social programs," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking at SMRR as part of the problem and part of the 
establishment when we didn't have the votes to do so -- Chris Reed and the 
conservatives were the ones who approved 5 million square feet of development 
from 1984 to 1988." 
</P>
<P>
The tenants rights organization has officially remained neutral on the beach 
hotel because of the controversy. It has supported two candidates for City 
Council -- Tony Vazquez and Olsen. Olsen considers himself a staunch 
slow-growth activist; Vazquez says he considers himself a "controlled" growth 
candidate who has remained neutral on the McCarty hotel issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT-RELATED MEASURES 
</P>
<P>
Here is a synopsis of the three development-related measures that will be on 
the Santa Monica city ballot on Nov. 6. There also will be six other city 
ballot measures and a school district bond proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition S -- (Beach development ban) Would ban future development of hotels 
and large restaurants west of Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot through an initiative drive financed 
primarily by Douglas Badt, owner of the Sand and Sea Club, which was recently 
evicted from its publicly owned beach site. The measure was originally intended 
to prevent restaurateur Michael McCarty from building a hotel and community 
center on the site. The fate of the McCarty project is now specifically linked 
to Proposition Z, however. Meanwhile, Proposition S is being embraced by 
slow-growth advocates for its broader limitations on beach development. 
</P>
<P>
Council Candidates in favor -- Larry Jon Hobbs, Kelly Olsen, Kathleen 
Schwallie, Sharon L. Gilpin, Jean Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
Against -- Donna Alvarez, Christine Reed. 
</P>
<P>
No position -- Tony Vazquez, Robert T. Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition T -- (Beach development moratorium) Would establish a three-year 
moratorium on development of beachfront hotels and large restaurants, set aside 
50% of hotel bed taxes from beachfront hotels for parks and cleanup of beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on ballot through initiative drive financed by McCarty and 
by Maguire Thomas Partners, a large Santa Monica-based development firm that 
recently began building a beachfront project called the Santa Monica Ocean 
Hotel. The measure was originally designed to compete with Proposition S and to 
protect the sponsors' two hotel projects, but now will not apply to either one. 
The Maguire Thomas project is exempt because work has already begun. And 
Proposition T is superseded by Proposition Z as far as the McCarty project is 
concerned. What's left of Proposition T is a set of beach development 
restrictions milder than those of Proposition S. Supporters of Proposition T 
say the three-year moratorium should be used to study the overall beach 
development issue. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor -- Holbrook, Alvarez, Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Against -- Hobbs, Olsen, Schwallie, Gilpin, Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
No position -- Vazquez. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition Z -- (Beach hotel) Would repeal the City Council's approval of the 
Santa Monica Beach Hotel and Community Center, which restaurateur Michael 
McCarty plans to build on the site of the Sand and Sea Club. 
</P>
<P>
Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the urging of 
McCarty. On the premise that it would improve his chances of success, McCarty 
fought hard for council approval of the negative phrasing of the ballot 
question. The result is that supporters of the hotel must vote no, and 
opponents must vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in favor -- Hobbs, Olsen, Schwallie, Gilpin, Gebman. 
</P>
<P>
Against -- Alvarez, Reed. 
</P>
<P>
No position -- Holbrook, Vazquez.

WOO FEELING HOLLYWOOD HILLS HEAT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HOMEOWNERS IN THE SCENIC AREA BITTERLY OBJECT TO THE COUNCILMAN'S 
INTERVENTION THAT WOULD ALLOW A HOME BUILDER TO CHOP 80 FEET OFF PART OF A 
RIDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo has come under sharp attack by some Hollywood Hills 
homeowners for his efforts to help a corporate campaign contributor obtain 
special exemptions it is seeking to build $192 million worth of mansions 
overlooking Hollywood Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition to Woo and the project appears to be increasing, according to 
several factions of area homeowners. They say that so far, they have collected 
signatures from more than 1,300 residents and visitors to the reservoir area 
who oppose Woo's actions on behalf of the Jefferson Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents' objections are many. They say the massive development project 
will bring traffic and pollution to the wealthy neighborhood, and that it will 
encroach on wildlife habitat and mar the scenic views. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, they object to the developer's plan to flatten a portion of a 
ridge, reducing its elevation by 80 feet to create home sites. 
</P>
<P>
Such a ridge cut would be in direct violation of a sweeping environmental 
ordinance, the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan, which after 17 years of 
preparation is expected to come before the City Council for a vote within 
weeks. In anticipation of this, Woo introduced an amendment to the Mulholland 
plan early this year that would exempt Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson executives say it would be feasible to build the subdivision without 
the exemption, but that building it on a flattened ridge would make it more 
attractive and, in many respects, environmentally more sound. They also say 
that they have taken pains to seek out the opinions of nearby homeowners and 
address their concerns, and that the project as a result is extraordinary in 
its environmental sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some area homeowners have rushed to the defense of Woo and Jefferson. 
They say a few disgruntled homeowners with hidden agendas and a well-organized 
propaganda machine are attacking the councilman and the developer. 
</P>
<P>
One of Woo's colleagues on the City Council, Zev Yaroslavsky, has gotten 
involved, accusing Woo of "stooping to the very gutter of politics" because one 
of his aides solicited and accepted a campaign contribution from Jefferson. 
Seeking contributions from developers who have major projects pending is not 
illegal, but Yaroslavsky has said he is one of several council members who take 
pains to avoid such a relationship with developers when the project is in their 
own district. 
</P>
<P>
What is so sharply dividing the affluent neighborhoods high in the Hollywood 
Hills is a project being touted by Jefferson and its Japanese backers as 
"Bel-Air East." 
</P>
<P>
In all, Jefferson wants to build 64 estate-sized homes, to be priced as high as 
$3 million each, on a 172-acre parcel. The site, on the north side of the 
reservoir and not far from Universal City, is the largest and last remaining 
open canyon in the hills surrounding the reservoir, which also is known as Lake 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over the project's effects on traffic, pollution, wildlife and scenic 
views, as well as issues of governmental process, have incited various 
homeowner factions in recent weeks into something verging on war. 
</P>
<P>
Heated disputes have erupted at meetings. Neighborhood organizations have been 
snooping on each other, trying to determine who is allying themselves with 
whom. Flyers from anonymous people and mysterious groups are being slipped 
under doors and windshield wipers. Groups are accusing each other of 
circulating misleading propaganda and unfairly worded surveys and of engaging 
in smear tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But neighborhood activist Victoria Cubeiro says the opposition can be boiled 
down to one simple complaint: "The bastards are trying to cut our ridges," she 
said of the developer. "And what we're shaking our heads at is, why is (Woo) 
sticking his neck out so far to help them do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Woo's intervention on Jefferson's behalf occurred March 27, as the council's 
Planning and Land Use Committee was wrapping up discussions on the Mulholland 
ordinance before passing it on to the council. Woo successfully inserted an 
amendment to exempt Jefferson from the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson's original development proposal called for knocking more than 100 
feet off the ridge. After negotiations with Woo and local homeowners, it scaled 
back its plans to a cut of 80 feet. Jefferson officials contend that in their 
efforts to respond to the concerns of area homeowners, they have redrawn their 
plans for the project more than a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be folly for us to despoil the ridge," Jefferson said in a letter to 
area residents. "Who, then, would want to purchase our homes, or yours?" 
</P>
<P>
If the ridge cut is not permitted, Jefferson executives argue, the homes would 
be built on the steep hillside. This would cause the homes to be built closer 
together and would substantially reduce the overall aesthetic appeal of the 
development, they contend, not just for the new buyers but for other area 
homeowners who will have to look at the homes. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Woo's actions on behalf of Jefferson, particularly in light of 
the campaign contributions, have sparked a growing outcry. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the homeowners who oppose Woo's intervention have joined forces to form 
Save Our Ridges and the Hollywood Hills Homeowners Coalition, and they are 
pressing Woo to withdraw his amendment exempting Jefferson from the Mulholland 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Such special treatment, they maintain, never could have come about without 
Woo's help. "We didn't know you could do that -- cut such a ridge," Cubeiro 
said in an interview. "But if you've got a councilman behind you, you can." 
</P>
<P>
City records show that Thomas P. Sullivan, Jefferson's president, personally 
contributed $500 to Woo's reelection in spring of 1989 and $500 to Proposition 
H, the ethics reform bill spearheaded by Woo that was designed to curtail 
influence-peddling in City Hall. The ballot measure was approved by Los Angeles 
voters in June. In addition, Jefferson itself gave the maximum $1,000 allowed 
to Woo's 1989 campaign, and $4,500 to the ethics measure. 
</P>
<P>
An additional link between Woo and Sullivan is that Sullivan has acknowledged 
being a longtime friend of the parents of Woo's top aide, Gary Townsend. 
Townsend said in a recent interview that he had had little contact with 
Sullivan over the past 20 years until he became Woo's top assistant a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Townsend said, he has spoken several times with Sullivan regarding 
the Jefferson project. One of the times was when he solicited a corporate 
campaign contribution from Sullivan for the ethics bill. Following the 
discussion, the development company on May 10 donated the $4,500 to the 
Proposition H campaign. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how the contribution came about, Townsend responded that he told 
Sullivan it was an important initiative: "I said, 'Hey, why don't you 
contribute to Proposition H?' The timing made it look like a quid pro quo when 
there wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the ethics provisions of Proposition H was a 40% pay raise for 
City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Yaroslavsky, who vigorously opposed the measure because he objected 
to the pay hike, last May accused Woo at a council meeting of "stooping to the 
very gutter of politics" because his staff had solicited and accepted the 
Jefferson contribution. Although other lawmakers solicited contributions for 
the ethics measure, Yaroslavsky singled out Woo as being "unethical" because 
his office had sought funds from a developer with a pending project over which 
Woo had considerable influence. 
</P>
<P>
In all, developers and other corporate givers donated nearly $100,000 to the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Woo has said such donations do not make him feel "especially obligated" to help 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Another link between Woo and Jefferson is provided by Steven Afriat, a 
well-connected lobbyist who has been retained by Jefferson to help guide the 
Hollywood Hills development through the city approval process. Afriat also 
works for Woo as a paid fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Afriat said he believes Woo is helping the developer not because of any 
political favors, but because the project is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has voted against my clients more than he has voted for them," said 
Afriat, who has argued Jefferson's case in meetings at Woo's office. "I don't 
get favorable treatment from him. He's real careful about what he supports." 
</P>
<P>
Woo vehemently denies being influenced by campaign donations or political 
relationships. In fact, despite his sponsorship of the exemption from the 
Mulholland plan, Woo contends that he has still not decided whether to support 
the project as it goes through the City Council approval process. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of his independence, he said, lies in the fact that he is taking heat 
from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
"While some homeowners think I'm doing too much for Jefferson," Woo lamented, 
"Jefferson doesn't think I'm doing enough for them." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, Jefferson's president, agreed, complaining that Woo has demanded too 
many concessions. "He has been tougher than anybody," said Sullivan, "in trying 
to get something done that is environmentally sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan described critics of the project as a handful of "mad dogs" with no 
actual base of support. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, some homeowners and the executive board of one area group, the Hollywood 
Knolls Community Club, say the community's interests are best served by 
exempting Jefferson from the Mulholland plan because it encourages Jefferson to 
continue "good-faith negotiations" with homeowners and to listen to their 
concerns about the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
Such negotiations, they said, have led to major concessions over the last two 
years. The biggest was a reduction in the ridge cut from more than 100 feet to 
80 feet; Jefferson also has agreed to install a $250,000 gating system and 
build public hiking trails in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters are the sharply differing views about the project and 
about Woo among various community groups in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Four board members of the Hollywood Knolls Community Club, including President 
Dan Riffe, have issued a statement saying they "have supported -- and continue 
to support -- Councilman Woo's prudent amendment." 
</P>
<P>
In the statement, they urge neighbors, "Please don't be swayed by the 
histrionics of those who haven't bothered to put their efforts into serious, 
thoughtful planning for the betterment of our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the Hollywood Knolls group complained that their leaders 
threw their support behind Woo and Jefferson without consulting with the 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
Riffe, in fact, wrote to Woo on the community group's stationery last March to 
urge him to give Jefferson the exemption without polling his members or board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
When Woo later asked Riffe to poll his membership, the board of directors met 
in emergency session and approved Woo's actions, 10 to 0 with two abstentions 
-- again without telling the rank and file. A majority of the rank and file 
have since said in survey responses that their board was wrong for holding such 
a vote, and that Woo should rescind his amendment, according to Cubeiro. 
</P>
<P>
Another supporter of the exemption for Jefferson is Terry Canfield, president 
of the Lake Hollywood Estates Homeowners Assn. She contends that if the 
exemption is withdrawn and Jefferson is prohibited from making the ridge cut, 
the result would probably be a worse, more environmentally destructive project. 
</P>
<P>
But her group's rank and file, she admits, said in survey responses that they 
are split "right down the middle" on whether they support Woo and the project. 
</P>
<P>
And some have accused Canfield, a real estate agent, of supporting the project 
for personal gain -- a charge she denies. Canfield says she is no longer 
involved in her group's activities regarding Jefferson, to avoid any conflict 
of interest, because she hopes to make money when the company's homes are 
built, listed and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Less divided are two other community groups, the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn. 
and Hollywood Hills Improvement Assn. They have called on Woo to rescind his 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Woo says he is now asking all neighborhood associations to poll their members 
and report back to him on where they stand prior to the final vote by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to stick my neck out," said Woo, a media-conscious politician 
who is widely regarded as a prospective mayoral candidate, "I want to see if 
the neighbors really want this." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two independent, outside groups -- the 54-member Federation of 
Hillside and Canyon Assns. and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy -- have 
weighed in against Woo. Leaders of the groups say his actions undermine the 
landmark Mulholland plan and its mandate to preserve the views along the 26 
miles of scenic roadway from Lake Hollywood to Topanga Canyon.

MUSHROOM CLOUD SCULPTURE OKD FOR SANTA MONICA SITE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE 26-FOOT-TALL 'CHAIN REACTION' WILL BE PLACED BETWEEN THE COUNTY 
COURTHOUSE AND THE CIVIC AUDITORIUM.

<P>
A large atomic mushroom cloud should be looming over the Santa Monica Civic 
Center within the next year now that the City Council has approved the 
installation of a sculpture of a nuclear blast by Los Angeles Times political 
cartoonist Paul Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-3 vote on Tuesday night culminated a two-year approval process that began 
in the spring of 1988 when Conrad approached the city with a proposal for a 
26-foot sculpture, called "Chain Reaction," to be placed on a permanent site in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad also offered the piece to the city of Beverly Hills, which rejected it 
in March because an appropriate site could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long, long process," Conrad said after the meeting. "I don't think 
any artist should go through this." 
</P>
<P>
The process involved numerous delays, caused in part by disagreement over where 
to place the sculpture and whether it was appropriate for public art. The 
council accepted the Art Commission's recommendation that the sculpture be 
placed between the County Courthouse and the Civic Auditorium. It originally 
was to be placed in front of the gymnasium at Memorial Park at 14th Street and 
Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $250,000 cost of construction and installation of the sculpture, 
to be fashioned from oversized copper and stainless steel chain links, will be 
paid for by an anonymous donor, who will also assume the cost of maintenance 
for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the controversy over the artwork was generated by the 
political nature of both the sculpture and the artist, several residents who 
spoke at Tuesday's meeting objected to it more on aesthetic than ideological 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it to be objectionable, grotesque and offensive," said Bob Gabriel of 
the Santa Monica Historical Society. "It does nothing to enhance the beauty of 
Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
Others voiced concern over the sculpture's overtly social and political 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"What will be next for Santa Monica?" asked resident Jason Meisler. "A giant 
sculpture of the AIDS virus?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of those speaking in favor of the sculpture, however, praised the message 
it would send about nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a disturbing piece to some. But it will be a reminder, a 
disturbing reminder, of what we have all lived through," said Paul Leaf, a 
member of the Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Conrad's editorial cartoons in The Times often generate heated 
debate was also a cause for concern for some residents. But retired Judge Jack 
Tanner urged the council not to shy away from the work of a controversial 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul Conrad is a political cartoonist, the best in this country," he said. 
"Does he provoke controversy? He does. Does he provoke argument? He sure as 
hell does. But that's his job." 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the council voiced concern that the Arts Commission, in making 
its recommendation to accept the sculpture, ignored the results of a public 
poll the commission conducted last year. The commission placed a model of the 
work in the lobby of City Hall from July through October and encouraged 
residents to fill out surveys to indicate support or disapproval of the work. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey, which was not monitored and therefore allowed people 
to vote as many times as they wanted, indicated that 730 of those participating 
disapproved of the sculpture and 392 recommended that it be accepted. The 
results of the survey were overruled by the Arts Commission, which unanimously 
recommended to the council at its June 23 meeting that the sculpture be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"Asking people for their opinion is actually quite useless if you have no 
intention of following their opinion," said council member Christine E. Reed. 
"Why are we asking people for their opinion if all we do is go with the 
experts?" 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Herbert Katz agreed, and offered a substitute motion directing the 
Arts Commission to get a proper sampling of public opinion. The motion was 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Reed and Katz were joined by Mayor Dennis Zane in voting against the sculpture. 
Voting for it were David B. Finkel, William H. Jennings, Ken Genser and Judy 
Abdo. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, for his part, was glad the matter was finally resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, now the work begins," he said. "Now I know what Michelangelo felt when 
the Pope said, 'Paint that ceiling!' Now I've got to get the canvas out." 
</P>
<P>
He expects the work to be completed within a year.

L.B. STUDYING HOW TO STUDY DISNEY PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THORNY ISSUES ARISE ON FORMATION OF COMMITTEE THAT IS TO DISCUSS 
SIZE AND SHAPE OF PROPOSED $2-BILLION THEME PARK. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan that would guarantee local residents a voice in the Walt Disney Co.'s 
contentious proposal to build a $2-billion theme park downtown arrived at City 
Hall this week with brakes screeching. 
</P>
<P>
So thorny are the issues surrounding the mammoth park plan that the city has 
decided it needs two months -- not to study the size and shape of the park, but 
to study the size and shape of the citizens committee that will study the size 
and shape of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be like herding grasshoppers if it gets too big," Long Beach businessman 
Lloyd Ikerd told the Harbor Liaison Committee, which began to tackle the issue 
of citizen input Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
How many citizens is too many? Should they be allowed to look at records? 
Should they be allowed to sit at the table? Should the neighborhoods closest to 
the proposed park have a greater say on the committee than the ones, say, on 
the north end of town? If so, is Long Beach headed for a war between its north 
and its south? 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Disney unveiled its ambitious ideas for Port Disney on July 31, 
citizens have been organizing to ensure that they have a say in a project that 
could draw 13 million tourists yearly and change their town's very character. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents promptly put together a proposal to put a citizen 
representative on the team of Long Beach negotiators, and the idea was promptly 
trounced by other citizens who decided one resident could not be trusted to 
represent the conflicting wants of some 50 neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighborhood division is almost certain considering that a few parts of 
town stand to suffer the most from traffic and congestion the resort could 
cause, while other parts of town could enjoy the vast tax profits without ever 
bumping into a Disney tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Then Councilman Tom Clark came up with an idea for a committee made up of nine 
residents -- one appointed by each councilman -- 10 members nominated by 
recognized community groups and two appointed by Mayor Ernie Kell. 
</P>
<P>
That was sent to the Harbor Liaison Committee for study, which voted 
unanimously on Tuesday in favor of still more study, sending the idea to the 
city staff for a thorough going-over. City leaders hope to have some sort of 
proposal in front of the full City Council by January. 
</P>
<P>
"The wheels of justice move very slowly," attorney Randolph Linehan, who spoke 
out in favor of a citizen group, said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Wallace Edgerton contends there is no hurry to form a 
committee, since it could be a year before Disney and Long Beach even decide 
they want to be partners. Disney has also approached Anaheim with a similar 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark was pushing to get the committee up and running, lest the citizens 
feel left out. Already, he noted, the city and Disney have begun hiring 
consultants and preparing for negotiations that could begin within several 
weeks, although no date is set. 
</P>
<P>
Moderation won out. When the city staff asked for one month to look over the 
plan, Edgerton offered two. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential I am seeing out there for naysayers is significant," he said, 
noting that a little caution now could save a lawsuit later. 
</P>
<P>
The report is due back Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
On July 31, the Walt Disney Co. presented a master plan for Port Disney, a 
beachside resort and hotel complex in Long Beach. The city and Disney are now 
preparing to negotiate the terms of building the $2-billion project, a process 
that could take years to iron out. Despite the detailed sketches drawn up by 
Disney, the company has made no promises to build the resort, and could opt to 
put its fortune into a separate theme park near Disneyland in Anaheim.

DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers will have to help pay for public art displays in the city if a City 
Council proposal made last week is approved. 
</P>
<P>
In a 6-1 vote, the council directed City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Myers to draft an ordinance that would require developers who build 
non-residential projects to pay 55 cents per square foot of their projects to a 
fund for city art projects. Councilwoman Christine E. Reed voted against 
drafting the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The fee, which could generate $2.6 million in the next 20 years, would go to 
the city's Cultural Trust Fund and would come under the control of the Arts 
Commission. Under the proposal, 50% of fees from a given project would go to 
art displays in the vicinity of the construction site, while the rest of the 
money would be available for displays citywide.

CHARTER PANEL CREATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council created a Charter Commission last week to explore the future 
of city government and council elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Council voted 6 to 0, with Councilman David B. Finkel abstaining, to create 
a council-appointed 15-member commission that would review the nature of 
council elections, look at whether the city attorney and city clerk should be 
elected instead of appointed as under current rules, and consider whether the 
council should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed that the appointments should be made after the Nov. 6 city 
election, when three council seats will be decided. The commission will be 
required to submit a report to the council by Dec. 31, 1991.

BAN ON WOOD DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retreating from a proposal to make Santa Monica one of the first cities in the 
nation to ban the sale of wood from tropical rain forests, the City Council on 
Tuesday instead decided to prohibit itself from buying the environmentally 
taboo wood. 
</P>
<P>
The council also tabled a watered-down proposal, which would have required 
local businesses that sell such wood to post signs stating tropical 
deforestation is harmful to the environment, pending a 90-day review by the 
city staff on how such an ordinance could be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
On a 4-3 vote, with council members William H. Jennings, Ken Genser and David 
B. Finkel voting no, the council approved a ban on city purchases of the wood 
without the provisions for a sales ban or sign posting. 
</P>
<P>
The sales-ban proposal was dropped after City Atty. Robert M. Myers suggested 
that such a prohibition would be difficult to enforce given the wide range of 
products in which tropical rain forest wood could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Myers suggested the sign requirement, but some council members said it would be 
just as hard to enforce a sign-posting law as it would to determine whether 
businesses sell products that contain the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David B. Finkel, who proposed the citywide sales ban, was 
disappointed by the council's direction because he hoped the city could set an 
example for the rest of the nation on environmental action. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't initiate any kind of a movement from the top down," Finkel said. 
"Anything that is happening in the U.S. is happening at the city level."

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: IT IS THE CHOICE BETWEEN NINJA TURTLES AND CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the California Department of Education may be having its troubles with 
the subtleties of portraying ethnicity in American history books, a more 
immediate question is nagging at teachers in the classroom these days. 
</P>
<P>
It is the choice between Ninja Turtles and censorship. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that a lot of elementary and preschool teachers are growing frantic 
with their students' martial shenanigans, which seem to have replaced the mom 
and dad or doctor roles of old. The current model is the gang of Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles from the movie of the name and now appearing on TV, subduing evil 
with an act of violence every 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Having weathered GI Joe and "Kung Fu," some teachers draw the line at Ninja 
Turtles, forbidding any manifestation of the warrior cult in their classrooms. 
They associate the turtles, cute as they may be to look at, with the rise of 
violence and aggression in American culture. There are even teachers who will 
send a kid home for coming to school in a Ninja Turtle T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
This has brought on a backlash among teachers, and some parents, who think the 
little whirlwinds of retribution deserve the protection of the First Amendment 
every bit as much as the sadomasochistic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion split irreconcilably when the debate recently came up at the Verdugo 
Hills Chapter of the Southern California Assn. for the Education of Young 
Children, which is part of the nation's largest association of early childhood 
education teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to lay down any policy, the group's directors set up a debate, so that 
members could hear the best thinking of both camps and choose for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It was held Tuesday night at the Child Educational Center of Caltech/JPL, a 
corporate-sponsored day-care facility that occupies 10 classrooms of a La 
Canada Flintridge elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 women attended, mostly teachers and parents from the area and some 
students of early childhood development. Only two men were in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Four panelists were seated by viewpoint, their positions identified by two 
lime-green T-shirts draped over a table. One sported a Ninja Turtle crossed out 
with the circle and bar symbol for no, and the other the word "Censorship," 
also crossed out. T-shirts were on sale at $12 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist is a consultant on TV and film 
scripts, objected to the polarization of the question, which made it seem that 
being against Ninja Turtles made one for censorship. She said she was against 
Ninja Turtles but not for censorship. 
</P>
<P>
She cited studies showing that violent imagery causes "psychological unrest and 
bad development." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very strongly that Ninja Turtles should not be allowed in school," she 
said. "When children play with violent toys like Ninja Turtles, their play 
becomes aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Joann Hannaford, a teacher at the La Crescenta Presbyterian Center for 
Children, said matter-of-factly that she banned Ninja Turtles from her 
classroom and had been rewarded with a drop in unruly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's censorship, I do censor what goes on in my classroom and I'm not 
ashamed of it," she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Draude, a teacher at the Child Day Care Center at Mt. St. Mary's 
College, said he had just tuned in to his first Ninja Turtle show and found it 
to have a highly moral theme, of four men learning to follow a role in the 
battle against evil. 
</P>
<P>
Reading a handwritten lecture, Draude cited Freud and several authorities on 
childhood development. His point was that kids have always played super-hero 
games to address the powerlessness of childhood. He said he delighted in war 
games as a child, then grew up to be a conscientious objector. His conclusion: 
taking away the super heroes merely denies the teacher a tool for guiding 
children to an understanding of their aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Deane Phinney, director of the Burbank First United Methodist Nursery School, 
advocated a middle-of-the road position neither banning specific games or toys 
nor allowing them to dominate play. She thought teachers could intervene to 
help those children who display excessive aggression. 
</P>
<P>
The question period became a rapid-fire give and take. One young teacher asked 
how she could be expected to intervene when there is "a little group over there 
kicking each other and a little group over there kicking each other." 
</P>
<P>
Another pointed out that the Ninja Turtles present a sexist image. 
</P>
<P>
Several dismissed Draude's eloquent argument with testimony of their experience 
that when the Turtles are banished, the classroom violence stops. 
</P>
<P>
But others argued that they have found ways to channel the Turtle games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not banned anything, but we do not allow children to hurt each other," 
one teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Draude tried to shrug off the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids don't play with Ninja Turtle anymore," he said. "It's come and gone." 
</P>
<P>
"Ninja II is coming out," a woman shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Ninja Turtles seem to be as divisive as abortion. But at least there is a 
middle road and it is taken by nurturing people.

BEST BETS: GRAND DAME OF MUSICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of this area's best entertainment bets is the Santa Barbara Civic Light 
Opera's 1990-1991 season, which just kicked off with the classic American 
musical "Mame" at the Lobero Theater in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
And 51% of the light opera's season subscribers are residents of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"The 51% represents advanced paid subscriptions, but total annual ticket buyers 
last year included more than 33,000 from Ventura County, out of more than 
64,000 total tickets sold," the group's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe received national attention this year when it was named a finalist 
in the 1989 Regional Tony Awards. It was the only musical theater company among 
the nine nominees. 
</P>
<P>
"Mame" plays at 8 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday and 7 
p.m. Sunday, through Oct. 28. Tickets cost $21 to $22.50. Season subscriptions 
are still available at greatly reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the light opera's 1990-91 season includes the musicals "Annie," 
"Singin' in the Rain" and "A Chorus Line." 
</P>
<P>
This year, a three-show subscription for children is being offered at $33.75 
for "Mame," "Annie" and "Singin' in the Rain." 
</P>
<P>
"Mame" stars Toni Kaye, who performed for six years on "The Carol Burnett 
Show." Her film credits include "Funny Lady" and "Pennies From Heaven." She 
choreographed and starred opposite Mickey Rooney in the stage hit "Sugar 
Babies." 
</P>
<P>
Lobero Theater is at 33 E. Canon Perdido. For more information, call 963-0761.

MEMORIAL HOSPITAL GETS NEW CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frances Hanckel, a senior vice president for medical care programs at Long 
Beach Memorial Medical Center since 1989, has become the hospital's new chief 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
As such, she has taken over daily operations of the 998-bed facility from 
Michael Jhin, former chief operating officer, who was reassigned to the medical 
center's corporate office. 
</P>
<P>
According to hospital spokesman Ron Yukelson, the change is part of a 
restructuring of the hospital's senior management team undertaken by Richard T. 
Williams, who was named the corporation's chief executive officer in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It has flattened out our management structure and made us more efficient," 
Yukelson said of the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Memorial, Hanckel was vice president of planning at the 
University of Maryland Medical System in Baltimore, and associate hospital 
director and chief planning officer at Temple University Hospital in 
Philadelphia.

DEDICATION AND OPEN HOUSE TODAY FOR NEW FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dedication ceremony and open house will be held at 10:30 a.m. today at the 
new Bell Gardens fire station at 7100 Garfield Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The station, which cost more than $1 million, replaces the Fry Street station 
that was built in 1954 and was considered too small and too old by 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"The old one was so bad, it's unbelievable," said Los Angeles County 
firefighter paramedic Mark Delgado. "Things were falling apart. We could barely 
walk around the rigs because there was not enough room. This one has so much 
more room. It's a lot more comfortable. It's just real nice." 
</P>
<P>
The new station, with 6,200 square feet, is twice the size of the old building 
and is adjacent to the police station and City Hall in the Civic Center 
complex. It can accommodate 10 firefighters and has a recreation room, showers, 
lockers and a patio with a barbecue. The project was financed with city 
redevelopment agency funds.

YOUTH GROUP DENIED PERMIT TO SELL BEER AT MALL OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lynwood City Council last week refused to grant an East Los Angeles youth 
group a permit to sell beer during the opening of a new indoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollenbeck Youth Center's request to sell beer during the grand opening of 
the Lynwood Marketplace was not approved after the council could not get the 
two votes required to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
David Fuentes, a representative of the center, promised that the group would 
provide security and strict control over the sales, but some council members 
were not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"Selling beer in a parking lot with so many kids around does not seem 
reasonable," Councilwoman Evelyn Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the opening Saturday was a success, with more than 50,000 in 
attendance during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Marketplace, which contains more than 100 small shops, is at 3100 E. 
Imperial Highway in a former Montgomery Ward department store. 
</P>
<P>
Electronics, leather goods, plants and beauty supplies are among the shops in 
the two-story, 800,000-square-foot mall.

PARK AVE. SCHOOL CLEANUP TOPIC OF BRIEFING TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of meetings to discuss the petroleum contamination that shut down 
Park Avenue Elementary School last year, parents, teachers, state and school 
officials tonight will be briefed on the cleanup of the campus and its 
long-awaited reopening Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Park Avenue Environmental Task Force, which was set up to 
discuss and recommend solutions for dealing with the contamination, will begin 
at 6 p.m. at the school, 8020 Park Ave., Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Park Avenue Elementary was closed by the Los Angeles Unified School District 
last July after parents and teachers voiced concerns that the sticky black goo 
that formed small puddles on the asphalt playground was toxic. Studies later 
showed the goo to be petroleum sludge that had been buried in an old dump on 
which the school was built. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several months, an environmental engineering firm has been working 
to contain the sludge by capping the playground with a thick plastic cover and 
a layer of fresh asphalt. A built-in venting system to dissipate gases also was 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said the 1,065 students of Park Avenue, who have been 
attending two other local schools, will return to Park Avenue on Monday.

MORATORIUM ENACTED ON HIGH-DENSITY DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of a continuing controversy over the city's plan to rezone 
portions of Bell Gardens, the City Council this week passed an emergency 
moratorium limiting high-density development. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several months, officials have been mulling over extensive 
revisions to the city's zoning code that would take effect over the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
If the revisions are adopted, several neighborhoods would be completely rezoned 
-- a prospect that has residents and business owners in targeted areas in an 
uproar because their property values could decline and they eventually may be 
forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, developers, fearing that the zoning changes will be adopted, 
have been besieging City Hall with plans for multifamily dwellings, City 
Manager Claude Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of people coming in trying to get in under the line," Booker 
said. "What the moratorium does is stop high-density development where there is 
some potential that the area will be rezoned." 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium went into effect this week and will stand for the next 45 days, 
Booker said. By that time the decision on zoning revisions should be made. If 
the Planning Commission and City Council still have not taken action on the 
proposed changes by then, the moratorium may be extended for a year, he said.

THREE UNDERDOG DEMOCRATS TAKE THEIR CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCES INTO CLASSROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When political science professors Guy Kimbrough, Peter Mathews and Fred Smoller 
lecture to their students about the power of interest groups and the role of 
money in elections, they offer more than just dry observations gleaned from 
scholarly journals. 
</P>
<P>
For while all three are capable of elevating their political discussion to a 
theoretical plane, they are also all in the midst of their own very real 
campaigns for public office: Kimbrough is a congressional candidate, hoping to 
unseat Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), Smoller has his sights set on 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), and Mathews is challenging Assemblywoman 
Doris Allen (R-Cypress). 
</P>
<P>
All three also are Orange County Democrats, and chances are good they'll still 
be teaching after the November election rather than lecturing new legislative 
colleagues on Gramscian hegemony or the decline of the American party system. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped any of them from waging aggressive campaigns. And, if 
they are unsuccessful in pulling off the upset, their candidacies are an 
opportunity for themselves and students to learn firsthand about politics, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"You participate in the process and you gain new insights," said Smoller, a 
tenured professor at Chapman College, who recently had a book published on 
media coverage of the White House. "As a teacher . . . I thought this would be 
an interesting way to create some opportunities for my students." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman students helped produce a 30-second cable TV ad for Smoller's campaign 
that attacks Lewis for alleged ethical transgressions. Smoller's campaign 
manager, Rob Crane, is a 21-year-old Chapman senior and political science major 
who hopes to be a full-time political consultant someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably have the only campaign manager in the county who works part-time in 
a comic book store," Smoller said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrough, who heads the political science program at Mt. San Jacinto College 
in Riverside County, has a number of his former students who are now at 
four-year colleges in high-level positions in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews, who teaches courses in government, politics and international 
relations and is co-director of the political science club at Cypress College, 
has built up an extensive network of student volunteers who work out of an 
office set up next to a pizza parlor across from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is strictly a grass-roots effort," said Mathews, who hopes to raise about 
$16,000 altogether. 
</P>
<P>
All three professor-candidates use students in their campaign, but they have 
different rules regarding their use. Smoller said he would allow students in 
his classes to work on his campaign, leaving open the possibility that other 
students in the class might feel pressured to do the same. Both Mathews and 
Kimbrough said they do not allow students currently taking their classes to 
volunteer for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's appropriate," said Kimbrough. 
</P>
<P>
"We can both be totally honest, but there is still the appearance of a 
conflict-of-interest," said Mathews. "I've had to turn several students down 
who wanted to volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
Smoller, however, said he sees no problem using current students, adding that 
he does not currently have any of his students working on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I have students baby-sit for me too, is that a conflict?" Smoller said. "Given 
the probable outcome of this race, I really see this as an experience to take 
part in a campaign, and I don't want to deprive them of a really meaningful 
project." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem the three candidates must consider is how to keep their 
lectures from becoming campaign forums; all of them use their own campaign 
experiences to illustrate topics in their lectures, but say they try to keep 
their own politics from becoming the focus of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arose for Kimbrough when he showed one of his classes a tape of a 
candidates forum that included Kimbrough and Rohrabacher and asked the students 
to critique their performances. "If anything, what I will usually do is I will 
try to point out some of Rohrabacher's assets," said Kimbrough, who is shielded 
somewhat from the problem because few, if any of his students, are registered 
to vote in his congressional district. "It's a fine line you have to walk, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
Mathews says he makes an effort to keep his campaign out of the classroom, but 
if a student asks him his view on an issue, he will offer it. 
</P>
<P>
"Professors, I think, should give their own views as well as other views," 
Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
Smoller, who sees his candidacy as more of a valuable academic exercise than do 
the other two professors, also draws more freely on his campaign experience in 
class. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent lecture he delivered to a sociology class, Smoller talked 
extensively about his motivations for running and what he has learned as a 
candidate outside the Ivory Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely different set of activities from grading papers, standing up 
and waving to crowds, shaking hands," Smoller said. "People don't defer to Dr. 
Smoller. They're not impressed by my academic resume." 
</P>
<P>
Smoller also talked about something he calls "the fear of politics" in Orange 
County, a phenomenon that he says he has encountered again and again in his 
campaign -- voters at a street fair asking him why he is being "so political" 
on a holiday weekend, mall managers asking him not to bother shoppers outside 
their stores.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO REJECT BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 179 to 254, the House rejected the fiscal plan forged by President 
Bush and congressional leaders to cut deficit spending by $500 billion over 
five years through tax hikes and spending restraint. Republicans voted 71 for 
and 105 against and Democrats 108 to 149, sending government leaders in search 
of more politically acceptable fiscal solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The measure sought to raise the Medicare payroll tax as well as taxes on 
tobacco, alcoholic beverages, gasoline, luxury items, plane tickets and other 
items, and to curb or cut spending in the defense budget, Medicare, farm 
subsidies, civil service retirement and scores of other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives directed much of their criticism at the tax increases, while 
liberals said the plan favored the wealthy at the expense of people in poverty 
and on fixed incomes. Moderates also found much in it they disliked. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to side with the President and bipartisan Capitol Hill 
leadership and support the deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
To Back the President 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 380 to 39, the House approved a resolution (HJ Res 658) endorsing 
President Bush's military and diplomatic response to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. 
Although far outnumbered by backers of the President, critics argued that both 
he and Congress have disregarded the War Powers Act. 
</P>
<P>
That post-Vietnam law requires Capitol Hill approval, within 60 days of 
deployment, of military actions in which combat appears imminent. The troops 
are to be brought home if Congress fails to provide a green light. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote endorsed Bush's policies against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Moorhead (R): Yea 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Roybal (D): Nay

<P>
Rep. Waxman (D): Yea 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Accept More Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 231 to 192, the House passed a bill (HR 4300) increasing from 
540,000 to at least 775,000 the number of legal immigrants the United States 
will let in each year. This sent the bill to conference with a Senate bill 
raising the ceiling to 630,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is most favorable to foreigners with needed job skills, more than 
tripling the cap on employment-based visas. Most of the bill's other new slots 
would go to foreigners with family members in the United States and immigrants 
from European and African countries that in recent decades have had 
comparatively low quotas. 
</P>

A yes vote was to pass the bill.

FIRED CITY MAINTENANCE CHIEF SEEKING REINSTATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale city building maintenance superintendent, who was fired last week 
after a probe into misconduct allegations, is seeking reinstatement through 
Glendale Civil Service Commission hearings slated to begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Koehler, who supervised custodial services and communications repairs in 
city-owned buildings, was fired Oct. 3, said John F. Hoffman, the city's 
personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said Koehler had been on a paid leave of absence since early July, when 
Glendale officials began an investigation into allegations about Koehler's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The former superintendent has appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which 
was scheduled to begin reviewing the matter late Wednesday afternoon. Koehler, 
a Glendale resident, had been a city employee for three years in a post that 
pays about $64,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the hearings will likely take several months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Citing confidentiality rules regarding city personnel, he refused to reveal the 
reasons for Koehler's firing. He said the findings may become public if Koehler 
requests open appeal hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Koehler's attorney, David Cordier, said Wednesday that some of the allegations 
against his client are "pretty silly" and do not constitute grounds for 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
He said one of the city's charges was that Koehler took home junk wood to burn 
in a fireplace, but Cordier said that has been an accepted city practice for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Allegations of mismanagement are absolutely contrary to his performance 
evaluations, which have been exemplary," Cordier said.

PARAMOUNT TO OPEN COURT FOR TRAFFIC TICKETS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIAL: THE BRANCH OF COMPTON MUNICIPAL COURT IS BEING ESTABLISHED TO EASE 
OVERCROWDING AT THAT FACILITY.

<P>
Paramount will open a branch of Compton Municipal Court in a shopping mall in 
January to speed the handling of traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
The court branch will be in response to complaints from residents about long 
waits and crime in Compton. The branch will be housed in the Paramount Plaza 
Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Municipal Court is part of a statewide system handling civil, criminal 
and traffic cases. At the criminal level, misdemeanors are tried and 
preliminary hearings are conducted to determine whether defendants charged with 
felonies should stand trial in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Compton's judicial district includes Carson, Lynwood, Paramount and other 
Southeast areas of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
For several years Paramount residents have lobbied for a break with Compton 
Municipal Court, saying its caseload is backlogged and the area around the 
courthouse is unsafe. They have asked that Paramount residents be allowed to 
use another court, such as Los Cerritos Court in nearby Bellflower, or to build 
a courthouse addition to the Compton system in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
One of the residents, Daisy Majak, said the Compton system is so overwhelmed 
that many Paramount cases, especially those involving minor offenses, "never go 
to trial." 
</P>
<P>
Resident Leona Stahovich agreed: "With their (Compton's) murders, rapes and 
robberies and our tenant evictions, bad checks and traffic, our problems are 
insignificant compared to their caseload." 
</P>
<P>
Although Steven A. Sowders, head deputy district attorney for Compton, admitted 
that the high volume leads to more plea-bargaining in drug and nonviolent 
cases, he said this was typical for a busy courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the second-busiest courthouse in the county," Sowders said, "following 
only downtown Los Angeles. . . . The case backlog is a fact of life and goes on 
everywhere. It is more acute in crowded courthouses." 
</P>
<P>
The solution, he added, was building more courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount residents said they are afraid of being in Compton. Majak said: "I am 
not an easily intimidated person. When I go to Compton court, I fear for my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
But Paramount officials said an overcrowded caseload and not crime in Compton 
was behind the decision to open a storefront courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said fear or crime is exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six months, 10 crimes were reported in the Compton courthouse and 
parking lots, eight of them involving people trying to bring weapons into the 
building, said Lt. Clifford Green of the Los Angeles County Safety Police 
Division. The metal detectors sounded and the suspects were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The other two incidents were reports of car break-ins in the parking lot, Green 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The Safety Division is an agency independent of the Sheriff's Department that 
oversees security at all courthouses in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Green said Compton's "is perhaps one of the best secured courthouses in the 
county" and added: "You are relatively safe inside the building. What's 
happening outside is just like any other area. There's no difference between 
Compton and South Central, Long Beach and Paramount." 
</P>
<P>
Compton Council Member Maxcy D. Filer agreed: "There's crime in every city. 
Crime doesn't stop at Paramount's corner or at Compton's corner." 
</P>
<P>
The storefront courthouse is expected to cost Paramount $15,000 to $20,000, 
according to Patrick West, Paramount's deputy city manager. The county will 
provide and pay for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues from a traffic school in the courthouse will be shared by the school, 
the city and the shopping center landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents would prefer to use the Municipal Court in Bellflower. Of the 
six communities served by the Lakewood sheriff's substation, Paramount is the 
only one in Compton's district. Bellflower, Lakewood, Cerritos, Hawaiian 
Gardens and Artesia are all served by the Los Cerritos court in Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
West said Paramount officials asked the county to move their cases to the 
Bellflower court several years ago; the request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents hope that the new branch of Compton Municipal Court will 
eventually handle criminal cases as well as traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Jenny Lacayo said: "Anything is an improvement. I hope it (the 
storefront court) grows, possibly expands. . . . Who knows? Maybe someday we 
can have our own court."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 65-YEAR-OLD POLICE STATION HIT BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire at the old Northeast Police Station in Highland Park damaged vintage 
wooden furnishings but will not delay plans to renovate the historic station 
and turn it into a police museum, said the president of the Los Angeles Police 
Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
About 65 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out at 1 a.m. Monday in 
the station at 6045 E. York Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, but firefighters estimated the damage at $100,000, 
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause could not be determined immediately, and an arson investigation was 
begun, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old station, which was designated a city landmark, has not been 
used by the Los Angeles Police Department since 1983. A bond measure approved 
earlier this year is expected to provide funds for earthquake reinforcement and 
asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has approved plans to lease the building to the 
Los Angeles Police Historical Society for use as a police museum. Police Sgt. 
Richard Kalk, society president, said the fire apparently caused no major 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
But Kalk said the blaze destroyed some interior wood paneling, desks and the 
reception counter, all of which must be rebuilt. "We want to restore it back 
the way it was in 1925," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kalk said his group had planned to install an alarm system in the station this 
week because of continuing vandalism problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get there in time," he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS BUILDING CAP OF 1,400 UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council gave unanimous approval Tuesday to a building cap 
ordinance aimed at slowing the pace of housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the city will issue no more than 1,400 building permits 
annually for new houses, apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Among these, 700 permits will be earmarked for affordable housing, and the 
other 700 will go to build houses that can be sold or rented at prevailing 
market rates. 
</P>
<P>
The building cap is one of several growth-control measures developed by the 
city to curb a construction boom in multiple-family housing. The council placed 
a moratorium on new apartments and condominiums two years ago, saying they were 
contributing to traffic congestion and school crowding. 
</P>
<P>
The cap on building permits will take effect in 30 days, but no permits will be 
issued until the moratorium is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium is expected to be lifted after the council approves other 
growth-control measures, including citywide zoning changes that will cut the 
number of new units that can be built on each lot. The downzoning proposal is 
scheduled to be considered by the council Oct. 30.

FOR THE KIDS THEATRE ARTS FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
TWO DAYS OF HOG HEAVEN; 
</P>
<P>
THE WEDDING OF LORD BACON IS THE EVENT OF THE YEAR IN PUDDLEDUMPLIN. THERE IS 
ALSO CONTINUOUS ENTERTAINMENT FOR TWO DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to the 1850s English village of Puddledumplin. Meet Lord Swinburne 
Bacon, whose impressive snout befits his lofty position as town magistrate. 
He's about to take a bride and enter the blissful state of hog heaven. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be quite kosher, but the wedding of Lord and Lady Bacon will take 
place during the Theatre Arts Festival for Youth, Saturday and Sunday, on the 
grounds of the Peter Strauss Ranch near Agoura in the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is loaded with children's entertainment. Featured are some 30 
performing groups in a continuous swirl of music, stories, comedy, puppets and 
mime. 
</P>
<P>
The festival runs daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets are $9 for adults, $8 
for children, and anyone under 3 is admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is in its sixth year and last year about 4,000 adults and children 
attended. The Taffy Town Players, the lovable animal characters who inhabit 
Puddledumplin, were created four years ago as the centerpiece of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
The main character is Taffy, a Welsh field mouse. She's joined by Eduard de 
Ville, a Parisian sewer rat; Victor Otterman, an otter; Portland Bill, a sea 
dog; Benoit, a French frog; and Etienne, a Cajun possum. 
</P>
<P>
They will be at the wedding of Lord Bacon and his bride, a rather proper swine 
who keeps company with high society types. The wedding invitations state: "No 
gifts. We have everything." 
</P>
<P>
The wedding will be at 2 p.m. both days. Lord Bacon also will be the victim of 
a "Pork Roast" featuring the Taffy Town characters. 
</P>
<P>
During the festival, visitors can wander through Puddledumplin, with its town 
square, shops and tollbooth at the entrance. Taffy and her friends will mingle 
with children and invite them to dance around the Maypole. 
</P>
<P>
The Taffy Town Players is the creation of Michael Rogers, an illustrator, and 
John Wood, a children's entertainer. The characters are played by professional 
actors and actresses. 
</P>
<P>
"The makeup is quite remarkable," Rogers said. A face mold was cast for each 
character from Rogers' illustration. The form is glued onto the actor's face 
and the makeup is applied by one of three artists who prepare the characters. 
</P>
<P>
Professional makeup artist Clayton Martinez said it takes about an hour to 
prepare each character, but two hours in the case of Lord and Lady Bacon who 
require five appliances to create the pig face. The effect is similar to the 
character who plays the lion-like character on the television show "Beauty and 
the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Taffy Town Players, other entertainers appearing on three 
separate stages include musical humorist Dan Crow and singer Courtney Campbell; 
singer and songwriter Peter Alsop (Saturday only); We Tell Stories; and J.P. 
Nightingale, a collection of stories, songs, rhyme and mime performed by Wood 
and his wife, Pam. 
</P>
<P>
The Magical Moonshine Puppet Theatre and the Jim Gamble Marionettes will also 
perform. Mimes will be Schwartz and Chung, and Judi Garratt. 
</P>
<P>
Others include singer Joanie Bartels, Bob Schneider and the Rainbow Kids, a 
Mexican folk dancing group, traditional Japanese dancers and the rock band 
Craig and Company. 
</P>
<P>
There are other attractions too. Children can bring their ailing stuffed 
animals to the Doll and Bear Clinic where nurses from Childrens Hospital will 
tend them. 
</P>
<P>
Children can climb through a 40-foot-long nylon whale, decorate the interior of 
a giant balloon, and try their hand at puppet making and bead stringing. 
</P>
<P>
The Peter Strauss Ranch, also known as Lake Enchanto, is on 73 acres sheltered 
by sycamore and eucalyptus trees. In the 1940s and 1950s it prospered as a 
resort before actor-producer Peter Strauss bought it for his home. It was 
acquired in 1983 by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
The Theatre Arts Festival for Youth will be Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. on the grounds of the Peter Strauss Ranch near Agoura. Take the Kanan 
Road exit off the Ventura Freeway. Go south 2.8 miles, turn left on Troutdale 
Drive and continue for one-quarter mile. Go left on Mulholland Highway and 
immediately turn right into the parking lot. For information call 818-99TAFFY.

GLENDALE TO TEST 5-0 MARK AGAINST LEAGUE FOES

<P>
The Glendale High football team just keeps on rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Behind tailback Pathon Rucker and a swarming defense, the Dynamiters are off to 
a 5-0 start heading into their Pacific League opener Friday against Arcadia, 
the defending league champion. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, the only sophomore on the Times' All-Glendale team last year, has 
rushed for 800 yards and scored 14 touchdowns. In last week's 29-0 victory over 
Burbank, Rucker gained 128 yards in 20 carries despite running against a 
nine-man front. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's defense has also been impressive. The Dynamiters surrendered two 
touchdowns against Alhambra in the season opener, but have allowed only one 
since in bolting to their best start since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover (2-3), which lost to La Canada, 41-7, last week, opens Pacific League 
play Friday against Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley (3-2), a 7-6 winner over Burroughs last week, opens Pacific 
League play against Muir on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Dazed and confused: Crescenta Valley's Jason Steinlight staggered from the 
locker room before the Falcons' game against Burroughs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked as a pale as a ghost," Crescenta Valley Coach Jim Beckenhauer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the senior emerged as the unlikely hero in a 7-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been sick and I got too pumped up before the game," Steinlight said. "We 
were waiting and all of a sudden I got dizzy." 
</P>
<P>
Steinlight, a starting tight end and defensive end and a back-up kicker, didn't 
play in the first half, but was called upon late in the third quarter to kick 
the go-ahead extra point after regular kicker Jason Rountree was sidelined by a 
nagging thigh injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tempted to tell the coach to go for two points instead," said 
Steinlight, who had never kicked in a varsity game. "I felt all this pressure 
and I didn't want to look up after I kicked it. I just listened for the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting night." 
</P>
<P>
Little big man: Bobby Webster, a 5-foot-5 running back for Glendale College 
continues, to have a big impact on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, a freshman, gained 186 yards in 33 carries and scored four touchdowns 
in Glendale's 37-27 Western State Conference victory over Valley on Saturday, 
improving the Vaqueros to 2-2 overall and 2-1 in WSC play. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who gained 143 yards and scored two touchdowns in Glendale's 21-12 win 
over L. A. Southwest two weeks ago, scored on runs of four, two, one and six 
yards against Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will continue its WSC schedule Saturday at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Exciting newcomer: Occidental College, which unveiled an explosive freshman 
last year in running back Gary Little, and again this season in running back 
Brian Madlangbayan, is seeing another exciting newcomer develop. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Derrick Williams, a freshman from Crenshaw High, scored on a 
45-yard run and connected with Charles Jordan for a 95-yard touchdown pass in a 
22-10 nonconference victory over Trinity (Tex.) University last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental (3-2, 2-2), the three-time defending Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference champion, meets a surprisingly competitive 
Pomona-Pitzer (2-2, 2-0) on Saturday.

Mark Odom hasn't done the hula yet. But don't count it out. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, when the Carson native arrived here to play outside linebacker for 
the University of Hawaii, he has been teaching islanders how to dance, 
Odom-style. 
</P>
<P>
Odom's spontaneous sack celebrations have become legendary at Hawaii's Aloha 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With 28 career sacks, Odom needs just six more to break the school record held 
by Al Noga (now with the Minnesota Vikings). 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiians are hoping Odom will hula over a fallen quarterback after his 
record-breaking sack. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be calm," Odom said. "But I just get carried away. I make a sack and 
then I jump up and make a fool of myself. Sometimes I wish I could change my 
number or something." 
</P>
<P>
Odom, who says he never sack-danced as a prep standout at Long Beach Poly High 
School, has showed islanders an array of moves. But the Rainbow fans have named 
a few of their Odom favorites: 
</P>
<P>
* There is The Wrestling Referee, which Odom perfected last season when he 
sacked Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, fell to his knees, and thumped the Aloha 
Stadium turf with his fists as if Detmer was down for the count. 
</P>
<P>
* One of Odom's most creative dances is The Death Lick, in which Odom makes a 
"skull and crossbones" sign with his fingers over the downed quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
* A variation of that is The Mark of Odom, where Odom crosses his forearms. 
</P>
<P>
* And then there is The Dance of Doom, a modified limbo with Odom's arms waving 
hysterically over his head for punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
"I make 'em up as I go along," Odom said. "They change from Saturday to 
Saturday. I don't know what I'm doing half the time. It's because football is 
fun for me. . . . That's the whole reason I play football." 
</P>
<P>
The choreography, Odom said, is not rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner said: "I've seen a lot of players celebrate their 
sacks, but not many with the . . . style that Mark has. He must watch a lot of 
big-time wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
It started in Hawaii's first preseason game of 1987, when Odom was a freshman 
linebacker who had earned a starting job in a rebuilding defense. Five of the 
top six linebackers had graduated from a Hawaii defense that was ranked No. 5 
in the nation the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"We had wanted to redshirt Mark that year," Wagner said, "but he wouldn't let 
us. He played too hard." 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of that game, Odom blindsided Yale quarterback Kelly Ryan 
and dumped him to the turf. Aloha Stadium's crowd of 43,018 roared. 
</P>
<P>
And a dance was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so excited to get my first sack," Odom said. "And then it just . . . 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
It has been happening since. Odom finished with 11 sacks in 1987, and Hawaii 
went 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Odom was shifted to inside linebacker. Asked to stop the run, Odom 
recorded just one sack but led the Rainbows with 110 tackles. Hawaii went 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Odom's junior season that put the happy dancer into the national 
spotlight. Odom led the Western Athletic Conference in sacks with 13, was voted 
the conference's defensive player of the year by the media and helped Hawaii to 
a 9-3-1 record and an Aloha Bowl appearance against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
He has three sacks so far this season for the 2-2 Rainbows. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark gets off the ball real well, and he plays extremely hard," Wagner said. 
"We like to pressure the quarterback quite a bit here. We send five people at 
the quarterback a lot, and Mark is always at the front of it." 
</P>
<P>
Odom set the Hawaii record with four sacks of Detmer -- the favorite to win 
this year's Heisman Trophy -- in the Rainbows' 56-14 blowout of Brigham Young 
last season. On another play, Odom tackled Detmer and caused him to fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"Detmer isn't a big guy, but pound for pound he's one of the toughest 
quarterbacks around," Odom said. "I laid some real hits on him, and every time 
he got right back up. On one play, I hit him square and put him on his back, 
but he still threw a 20-yard completion." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii and Brigham Young meet in this season's WAC finale. Odom plans to keep 
the pressure on Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
"If you let him sit back there and get comfortable, he'll just take you apart," 
Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-feet-11, 219 pounds, Odom is a cat-quick linebacker. But some scouts 
contend that he lacks the height to play in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mark has a shot at the NFL," Wagner said. "Obviously, his lack of 
height is a liability, but with a guy like him it just might be a matter of 
timing and luck." 
</P>
<P>
Odom is expected to graduate with honors in May from Hawaii's School of 
Business -- one of the university's most challenging programs. So Odom will 
have a degree -- earned in four years -- to fall back on if a career in pro 
football fails to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouts are always hung up on things like height and weight," Odom said. "I'll 
just play hard and let things happen. I would say I could play on another 
level, but if I don't get my shot, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Carrier, a friend and teammate of Odom at Long Beach Poly, is now a safety 
for the Chicago Bears after being an all-American at USC. Odom used to watch 
Carrier play on TV -- since Hawaii's games are at night and start late on the 
West Coast because of the time difference. 
</P>
<P>
Watching college football all day gets Odom fired up for his games later that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't live without ESPN," Odom said. "I watch sports all the time -- 
everything from football to the world championships of table tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Then he gets in a dancing mood. Even Hawaii's coaches don't mind Odom's 
displays of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to demean our opponents," Wagner said. "But if a guy is playing 
hard and makes a great play, and is showing genuine enthusiasm, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
Odom doesn't figure to quit cutting the rug soon, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then, my teammates make fun of me," he said. "But they know I'm 
just having fun. As long as I keep doing my job and making sacks, I'll be 
having fun."

WORRIES GROW OVER FRYMAN CANYON COST; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BUYING THE ACREAGE AT THE CURRENT PRICE OF $10.9 MILLION COULD 
DELAY THE PURCHASE OF OTHER LAND.

<P>
Buying Fryman Canyon in Studio City at the current price would be by far the 
costliest purchase ever made by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, giving 
the state parks agency and its conservationist allies a splitting financial 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joe Edmiston warned recently that it would be a 
long time before the conservancy could buy more parkland in the city of Los 
Angeles if Fryman Canyon soaks up $10.9 million. That is the price called for 
under a proposal by Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Michael Woo, who 
represents the area, to buy the canyon from developer Fred Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
In early November, the conservancy board of directors and then the Los Angeles 
City Council are expected to vote on the Bradley-Woo plan to add Fryman Canyon 
to the conservancy's mountain park system. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's plans to build 26 luxury homes on the steep-sloped, wooded site set 
off weeks of campaigning by annoyed neighbors and environmentalists, who pushed 
the idea of buying the canyon for parkland to block development. 
</P>
<P>
But at $10.9 million, the 31-acre Fryman property would cost more than $350,000 
per acre. 
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, $8.7 million would be paid by the conservancy under the 
Bradley-Woo plan, thus making the conservancy's per-acre cost $280,000 -- more 
than five times the conservancy's most expensive previous purchase of raw land. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's most expensive acquisition to date has been the 
Holland-Avaness property, 22 acres in the Santa Clarita Woodlands area acquired 
in July for $5.1 million, or $231,818 per acre, according to a conservancy list 
of its 10 most recent purchases. 
</P>
<P>
But the Holland-Avaness property, named after its former owners, was costly for 
unusual reasons. Located west of the Golden State Freeway at the foot of Rice 
and East canyons, the land offered a strategic position to block access to 
Towsley Canyon, which is being considered by Los Angeles County as a potential 
site for a landfill. The conservancy opposes the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
And the site has a motel and stable on it and is commercially zoned, Edmiston 
said, unlike the vacant land in Fryman Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive undeveloped, residentially zoned property ever bought by the 
conservancy was a 37-acre Cherry Canyon parcel in La Canada Flintridge that 
went for $1.75 million, according to the conservancy list. That works out to 
$47,200 per acre -- less than one-fifth the per-acre cost considered for 
Fryman. 
</P>
<P>
(Although Sahadi's entire Fryman property is 63 acres, 32 acres are already 
pledged to be donated to the conservancy, so the purchase price applies only to 
the remaining 31 acres.) 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston is not the only one fretting about the price tag on the deal proposed 
by Bradley and Woo. 
</P>
<P>
Regrets, concerns and recriminations over the cost of the proposed deal can 
also be heard from other quarters, from San Fernando Valley environmental 
activist David Brown to West Side Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and advocates of a 
plan to upgrade parkland in the Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The doubts boil down to two questions: 
</P>
<P>
* Is Fryman Canyon worth what the Bradley-Woo proposal offers? 
</P>
<P>
* What other parkland purchases must be sacrificed or postponed to pay for 
Fryman's huge costs? 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy and council may resolve these questions soon. 
</P>
<P>
When they formally consider the Bradley-Woo plan in early November, conservancy 
officials expect to have a new appraisal of the Fryman property and an opinion 
from the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council is scheduled to decide in early November whether to 
approve spending $1.96 million of Runyon Canyon trust fund money for the 
buyout. The Bradley-Woo plan relied on such a contribution to bring the total 
payment to $10.9 million. The package also envisioned private parties making 
$250,000 in charitable contributions and $8.7 million from the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
But the last-minute misgivings and nervousness expressed by some have irritated 
the mayor's office and prompted Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani to speculate that 
perhaps Edmiston is seeking to torpedo purchase of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason Joe Edmiston and the conservancy have cooled to the idea of 
buying Fryman Canyon," Fabiani said in an interview last week. "We feel we 
reached a fair resolution of the price, and if Edmiston and the conservancy are 
changing their minds about it, they should step forward and say so instead of 
engaging in behind-the-scenes maneuvers to scuttle the project." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston denies he's trying to scuttle the purchase. But he does point out a 
dilemma posed by such high-priced venture. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to dump all our city of Los Angeles projects in one basket?" 
Edmiston asked. "No one should be surprised" if the conservancy, as it tries to 
serve its other geographic constituencies, says "we're going to have to take 
away from other projects planned for the city of Los Angeles because you got 
Fryman," Edmiston argued. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not irrational to say: What about Ventura County and its needs?" 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky last week questioned the Bradley-Woo deal after 
being briefed by Edmiston about its impact on planned conservancy purchases in 
his district, which straddles the Santa Monica Mountains from Franklin Canyon 
to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now you haven't heard from other quarters" about their concerns about 
buying Fryman for $10.9 million, but that will change, Yaroslavsky pointedly 
warned Woo on the council floor. "There are major acquisitions that are much 
cheaper than this one." 
</P>
<P>
Several of these are in his own district, Yaroslavsky noted. Proposed 
conservancy projects in Yaroslavsky's district include spending $400,000 to 
build a paleontological field station at Fossil Ridge -- a Studio City slope 
rich in fossils of ancient marine life that is already owned by the conservancy 
-- and buying two vacant properties near Beverly Glen and Mulholland drives. 
</P>
<P>
David Brown, an environmental activist, said in a recent interview that he has 
increasing doubts about the advisability of the Fryman purchase. One concern is 
the accessibility of the canyon to public transit, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"If people from the flatlands can't get to it, I don't want to buy it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also said that the bulk of a conservancy-owned parcel adjacent to the 
Fryman property is fenced off because vagrants have camped there in the past. 
"We bought that for $1 million and we're not getting our full value out of it," 
he said, wondering if the same might not happen at Fryman. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed price also drew protests from the Pacific Palisades. To fund the 
Fryman purchase, the Bradley-Woo deal envisions tapping all of the 
$1.96-million Runyon Canyon Acquisition Trust Fund, established for land 
purchases in the canyon in Hollywood. In seeking Recreation and Parks 
Commission approval to use this money, Woo offered no absolute guarantees that 
he would be able to replenish the account with other funds. 
</P>
<P>
Woo's failure to provide such assurances left advocates of Temescal Canyon Park 
in the Pacific Palisades unhappy. Temescal Canyon has been slated to receive a 
$719,000 loan from the Runyon Canyon fund to finance plans to build a parking 
lot, restrooms and a kiosk and place utility lines underground. 
</P>
<P>
With funding for their park in jeopardy, Palisades residents fired off angry 
letters to council members, arguing against any plan to sidetrack funding for 
the Temescal improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as Edmiston sees it, is that there is a reaction against the 
Bradley-Woo deal because it gives too much to the developer. "People are now 
beginning to realize the jeopardy," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fryman is not so crucial that we should buy it at any cost," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
But Fabiani, the mayor's top aide, said the mayor's office is mystified by 
sudden concerns about the conservancy projects that would have to be postponed 
or dropped because of the Fryman purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems strange to bring up other competing interests now," Fabiani said. It 
is "not very comforting," he added, to hear that the conservancy's professional 
staff is only now coming to grips with the fiscal ramifications of buying 
Fryman Canyon.

EGET COURTING SUCCESS AS VOLLEYBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the tradition of alumni such as Brad Holland, Greg Goorgian and Harvey 
Mason, Barry Eget made a name for himself at Crescenta Valley High by lighting 
up the scoreboard on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Despite playing with bum knees that required him to slip floating cartilage 
into place before and often during games, Eget led the Southern Section 4-A 
Division in scoring in 1987, averaging just more than 27 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Today, having derailed his own college career before it even had a chance to 
begin, Eget has returned to Crescenta Valley as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
He daily instructs players how to pass, score and exploit an opponent's 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Eget, however, is relaying his knowledge on the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
After assisting last year with the Falcons boys' volleyball team, Eget is the 
head coach of the school's burgeoning girls' program. 
</P>
<P>
Although just 3-6 entering this week, the Falcons knocked off Burbank in their 
season opener and extended traditional powers Hoover and Hart to five games 
before falling. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the improved play is Eget -- who had never touched a 
volleyball until three years ago -- and his fiancee Lynn Andriese, a former 
All-Southern Section setter at Ontario Christian High who serves as Eget's 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has brought seriousness and commitment to the program and motivated 
the players to compete regardless of mismatches in size and experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, once we fell behind, we lost it and could not come back," junior 
middle hitter Jodie Larson said. "This year, we have more heart." 
</P>
<P>
Eget's ability to instill that quality in his players has surprised many on 
campus. Most coaches and administrators remember Eget as a hard-headed high 
school student who gave up a scholarship at Cal State Northridge because he was 
not projected to start his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
"When Barry came back it was with a much more mature attitude," Crescenta 
Valley Principal Ken Biermann said. "I think he was surprised in a way that we 
would give him an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's proven to us that he's capable. . . . He's molded himself, like the 
other coaches here, so that it's right to have high expectations and hold his 
players accountable." 
</P>
<P>
Eget admits he didn't always see things so clearly, especially when he arrived 
at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going through a stage where I thought I knew everything," Eget recalled. 
"I took in everything people told me, but it just went out the other ear." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Northridge, Eget enrolled at College of the Canyons and worked 
out with the Cougars in preparation for the 1988-89 basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited," Eget said. "They had a high-speed game and I knew I would get 
to play a lot there." 
</P>
<P>
That summer, though, Eget blew out his knee again and underwent surgery for the 
sixth time. His basketball career was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the knees of a 50-year-old man," Eget said. "I thought maybe someone 
was telling me that my talents lay in another direction." 
</P>
<P>
That summer, Eget and former Crescenta Valley teammate Larry Resendez watched a 
two-man beach volleyball tournament at Manhattan Beach and decided to give the 
sport a try. 
</P>
<P>
Their first attempts were laughable. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't keep the ball in the air long enough to bump it over the net," 
Eget said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eget soon picked up the rudiments of the game. He began playing almost 
daily at the beach, where the sand cushioned the shock to his knees, feet and 
ankles. 
</P>
<P>
He became an assistant coach for the women's team at Canyons, where he met 
Andriese, and last summer he played 15 "B" tournaments with Resendez. 
</P>
<P>
Eget believes he "should have given basketball a better shot," but he also said 
his experiences have been "a blessing in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
If he had not left Northridge, he probably never would have played volleyball, 
met Andriese nor returned to his alma mater to build a volleyball program. 
</P>
<P>
"They have two coaches that can get in there and play with them at practice," 
Eget said. "When you play the game everyday and get in there and practice, I 
think that does a lot more than just standing in front of a chalkboard and 
telling them what to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons, who play at Muir on Friday, are led by Larson, who averages 13 
kills and eight blocks a match; senior outside hitter Danae Fielder, who 
averages 10 kills; and senior setter Lucy Quesada. 
</P>
<P>
Eget said it is only a matter of time before Crescenta Valley becomes a factor 
in the Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the other schools have girls that have been playing on club teams 
since they were 12 or 13 years old," Eget said. "We're just going to have to 
work that much harder. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always kind of been the CV way. They're never the biggest or the 
fastest, but they find a way to overcome those things."

CHRISTIAN SCHOOL MUST MOVE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
CHURCH: THE SCHOOL IS DENIED A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT AT ITS NEW LOCATION AFTER 
COMPLAINTS BY RESIDENTS.

Four months ago, students at Leffingwell Christian School left Norwalk and 
moved to a church in Paramount because the school's lease expired. And last 
week, the Paramount City Council told them they will have to move again. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4-to-1 to deny the junior and senior high school a 
conditional use permit needed for a private school to operate in a neighborhood 
of mostly single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The permit was denied and the school was ordered to move out because neighbors 
complained about congestion and the potential for gang and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
The private, nondenominational school began classes in June at the First 
Assembly of God Church on Orizaba Avenue and Monroe Street. Residents had no 
problems when the school was just 50 students during the summer, Mayor Manuel 
Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
After classes began in September and enrollment grew to 200, the traffic 
increased. Residents said they also saw more people in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen said the city confronted a similar issue a few years ago, when the 
Emmanuel Reformed Church applied to open a preschool and junior high school in 
the neighborhood. After discussing the issue with residents, the city allowed 
only a preschool with a maximum of 76 students. 
</P>
<P>
Officials then told the neighborhood that no more private schools would be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Now neighbors were faced with a "new school within 150 yards of Emmanuel 
Reformed," Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors also were apprehensive about the possibility of gang problems and 
drugs, he said. But school officials said neither was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Students were unhappy with the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Reddick, 15, of Norwalk, was upset with the arguments raised against 
the school. "The decision was very unjust," she said. "We had to move from the 
area where we were before. We're not a rowdy bunch of students." 
</P>
<P>
Kristal Poore, 15, of Norwalk, was worried about what will happen to her and 
her friends. "If we leave the school," she asked, "where are we going to go? 
There are not many people who are going to go to public school. This is our 
family." 
</P>
<P>
She added that Leffingwell, with tuition of $250 a month, is an inexpensive 
private school. 
</P>
<P>
School officials were determined to continue their fight. Principal John Clark 
said of the council's decision: "Looks like we're going to have to close up. We 
don't have any place to go. We're considering taking legal action." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dobson, a pastor with the Assembly of God congregation, said his church is 
looking into getting a rehearing before the City Council. He said there was not 
enough discussion at the meeting last week. "I am really appalled," he said. 
"Not by the decision. . . . I was appalled by the lack of information the 
council was interested in getting and the misinformation they had." 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Allen Parker, who cast the only dissenting vote, said he did not 
have enough information. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Dobson said he was told by the city Planning Department that a 
permit would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
But there was an apparent misunderstanding between the planner and Dobson, 
Deputy City Manager Patrick West said. The planner thought Dobson intended to 
expand an existing school. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council reversed an earlier decision by the Planning Commission 
approving the permit for the school. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on when the school must vacate is expected at the Oct. 16 council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Guillen, Gerald Mulrooney, Elvira Amaro and Esther Caldwell all 
voted to deny the permit.

A VENTURA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER INVITED A BEAR TO CLASS IN 1972 AND GOT AN 
INSPIRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Quiet, please. Brian Bemel, veteran Sheridan Way kindergarten teacher, folk 
music fan and volunteer founder of the Ventura Children's Festival, has a 
shaggy bear story to share. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time in the winter of 1972, a 23-year-old teacher named Brian Bemel 
was driving home to Ventura from a camping trip in Northern California. Around 
Big Sur, he stopped to pick up a hitchhiking bear. 
</P>
<P>
The bear was going to Ventura too, and Brian Bemel offered the shaggy beast a 
ride the whole way -- if the bear would come talk to his second-graders at 
Saticoy Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The bear was actually a Canadian circus performer between engagements; it was 
cold in Big Sur and he had put on the costume to stay warm. So the bear was 
happy to appear at Brian Bemel's class, and some days later, two dozen 
elementary school students found this bear inside a cardboard refrigerator box, 
in their classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my friend Billy the Bear," Brian Bemel said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bear did some juggling, and a few tricks, and finally took a seat and 
waited to see what would happen next. It was very quiet for a long time, until 
one brave second-grader approached Billy the Bear and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Hey. Bears don't have buttons." 
</P>
<P>
And so Brian Bemel and the bear explained what was really going on and talked 
about bears and circuses for a while. And all the kids paid close attention, 
and an enduring idea was born in Brian Bemel's head, and everyone, as far as we 
know, lived happily ever after. The end. 
</P>
<P>
"If you bring exciting people in," Bemel said last week, "kids are just 
enraptured." 
</P>
<P>
In the course of these last 18 years, Bemel has become the unofficial 
bringer-in of exciting people to the Ventura Unified School District. He still 
teaches kindergarten at Sheridan Way Elementary School, a campus tucked into 
the unglamorous neighborhood between the Ojai Freeway and Ventura Avenue. But 
he is also the man behind: 
</P>
<P>
* The Ventura Children's Festival, which presents monthly performances 
throughout the school year at either Ventura or Buena high schools. The next 
show in that series, Oct. 19, is an anthology of folk tales put on by the 
Magical Moonshine Puppet Theater at Ventura High. (Advance tickets cost $5.50 
for adults, $3.50 for children and $1 more on the night of the show.) 
</P>
<P>
* The Ventura schools' Guest Artist Series, in which performers -- often 
Children's Festival artists doing double duty -- appear during the school day 
for student audiences. The next of those presentations, set for the morning of 
Oct. 16 at Buena High, is to be the National Theater of the Deaf/Little Theater 
of the Deaf. (Tickets cost $2 each, and will go to fourth-, fifth- and 
sixth-graders.) 
</P>
<P>
* A series of monthly performing arts assemblies at Foster and Sheridan Way 
elementary schools, and occasionally at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
* A five-session series of arts education seminars for teachers, organized 
through the Ventura County school system. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Bemel estimated that he runs about $25,000 a year in arts programming, 
using school district resources like auditoriums and buses. He does it largely 
without outside donations, and makes it pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
That, officials said, is what makes his program substantially larger than any 
arts programming the school district offers through conventional channels. 
</P>
<P>
Bemel grew up in Los Angeles, where his father ran Bemel's Supply &amp; Salvage 
("We have it, can get it, or it isn't made"), and studied human development at 
UC Santa Cruz. His first teaching job, in Salinas, "was terrible . . . I was 
really into the open-education movement. . . . But I was really green, and I 
didn't know how to make something happen effectively." 
</P>
<P>
After one year, Bemel made his way south to Ventura and the second-graders of 
Saticoy Elementary. He was more conservative than he had been in Salinas, but 
still strayed from the beaten educational path. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Bemel moved to a suburb of Vancouver on a Fulbright teacher exchange. 
When he returned in 1982 he was married -- his wife runs a preschool at their 
home in Ojai -- and he had become a kindergarten teacher. And since 
kindergartners were too young to stage proper shows, Bemel started bringing in 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess, inside of me, there's a promoter and publicist," he said. "I found 
out there are a lot of things I can do that I'd never done before." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UP CLOSE BRIAN BEMEL 
</P>
<P>
Age: 41. 
</P>
<P>
Occupation: Kindergarten teacher at Sheridan Way Elementary School and founder 
of the Ventura Children's Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Stage: After 18 years of teaching and eight years of pulling together 
presentations for children, Bemel divides his loyalties between the individual 
satisfaction of teaching and the broader possibilities of producing children's 
performing arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
Rage: At the attitude that arts education is a frill and not an essential. 
</P>
<P>
Adage: "If you bring exciting people in, kids are just enraptured."

WRECKERS RIPPED INTO HISTORIC THEATER BY ACCIDENT, OWNER OF COMPLEX SAYS

It was merely a mistake when demolition workers illegally hacked down a section 
of the historic Whittier Theatre complex, said an attorney for Peter Doerkin, 
owner of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven workers took down support beams and sections of roof for about seven 
hours late last month before being discovered and stopped by residents and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The demolition contractor had a permit to demolish another theater building in 
the city of Whittier," attorney Charles Cummings said. "The crews went to the 
wrong place. They made a mistake. They went there without our knowledge, 
consent or approval." 
</P>
<P>
Demolition contractor Cleveland Wrecking is also the firm hired to level a 
non-historic theater near a mall more than two miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
The explanation did not satisfy City Council member Helen McKenna-Rahder, who 
had ordered workers off the site with the help of City Manager Thomas G. Mauk. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the key to the fence and the whole bit," she said. "There was no 
demolition permit or anything. We are pursuing a better explanation." 
</P>
<P>
In June, the state Office of Historic Preservation prohibited the 61-year-old 
theater's demolition. The developer intends to challenge the state in court, 
Cummings said.

IN THIS OFFBEAT STORE, YOU MIGHT WALK OUT WITH A JOSE CANSECO ROOKIE CARD OR A

Looking for the perfect gift to give that baseball card/fireplace mantle 
collector in your life? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for one-stop shopping you might want to try the Premier Sports Cards and 
Collectibles shop in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
You could pick up a Jose Canseco rookie card for about $100 and that mantle 
piece for $650. 
</P>
<P>
And why not toss in a Marilyn Monroe print, a used Duran Duran compact disc, a 
set of basketball cards and some jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
This offbeat business is owned by Mike Lynch and Mike Wills, two 27-year-old 
Ventura County natives who decided to chuck desk jobs for something a little 
more exciting. They opened the shop in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was stagnating. I was constrained as to what I could do at my 
other job," said Lynch, formerly a financial analyst at Northrup Corp. "The 
only similarity between that job and this one is that I have to get up in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said he's had customers come into the shop to look at sports items and 
walk out with furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"A mother came in with her son to look at the cards," he said. "She ended up 
buying a china set." 
</P>
<P>
A word of caution: There's a book sitting on the fireplace mantle titled "How 
to Sell Anything to Anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Remember last week we told you about a delivery service in Newbury Park that 
will send packages to the Persian Gulf at no cost? 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to send paperback books or magazines here's a tip from Mary Lynch, 
librarian at the Ray D. Prueter Library in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't send pictures of women into Saudi Arabia," she said. "Bare arms are 
a no-no." That includes the appendages of women featured in magazine ads. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch knows what she's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
The library sent some magazines via a Seabee battalion and plans to send an 
additional 500 paperbacks that are ready to go overseas whenever arrangements 
can be made to get them there. 
</P>
<P>
"The Seabees took a lot of romances and a lot of mysteries," she said. "But 
some of the covers had to be torn off the romances." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who'd like to donate some reading material can call 486-5460. 
</P>
<P>
In the announcement for its annual Sespe Rendezvous, the Ojai Valley 
Muzzleloaders Assn. listed some of the scheduled activities: 
</P>
<P>
"Black powder cartridge match, cannon match, wild savage attack, PLUS pancake 
breakfast with hot coffee." You know, a savage attack just isn't the same 
without some flapjacks and a cup of java. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the activities will be pretty authentic -- with costumes and equipment 
from the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that probably won't be authentic, though, is the menu. Said organizer 
Charles Bates: "We don't have access to buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
Is your bone marrow clean enough? 
</P>
<P>
Talk to Bill Berk. He'll be teaching an introductory class on the Chinese art 
of internal power exercise, Tuesday from 7:30 to 9 p.m. For information on the 
location call 486-0459. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise, Berk said, is a three-step process that demands some mental and 
physical exertion. 
</P>
<P>
"First you do a stationary meditation in a squat position with your arms in 
eight different positions," he said. "You hold it for anywhere from five 
minutes to three hours." 
</P>
<P>
Step two is bone-marrow washing. It involves lightly beating certain 
acupuncture points with metal rods wrapped in cloth. "It creates more blood 
cells and improves your immune system." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's step three, which can't really be discussed in a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say it has to do with swinging and holding weights with certain 
parts of one's body to improve the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, don't knock it. Berk said his teacher lived to be 117 years old. LEO SMITH

Along with the usual overzealous Boogey-board riders and ear-piercing sounds of 
teen-agers' radios, a Santa Barbara beach will be invaded by anything from 
giant octopuses to monster frogs this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In its 16 years, the Sandcastle and Sculpting Contest at East Beach has 
inspired such creations as mermaids, a dog watching TV and a New York City 
skyline. 
</P>
<P>
And if all goes well, a Ventura County dragon will appear in Santa Barbara for 
the 17th annual contest on Sunday, noon to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A group of employees at a Camarillo computer company won first place in a 
Ventura sand-sculpting contest this summer. They would like to recreate their 
legendary lizard, but the woman in charge of sculpting the head has moved to 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a headless dragon," team captain Carol Cook said. "And that's 
such an intricate part we don't know if we can get anyone else to do it in time 
for the contest." 
</P>
<P>
Most teams do a few practice runs before the contest to get things organized so 
they can finish their sculpture -- confined to a 15-square-foot area -- by the 
3 p.m. deadline. A total of $1,500 will be awarded to the winners, who will 
donate the money to a chosen charity. Contest entry is closed, but looking is 
open and free. To get to East Beach go north on the Ventura Freeway and exit on 
Cabrillo Boulevard. Turn left to the first visible beach. 
</P>
<P>
The films of three significant directors will be screened on three consecutive 
Sundays and Mondays starting this Sunday. The "Independent! Films by Black 
Women' series opens with works by the late Kathleen Collins, marking two years 
since her death. "Losing Ground" is an often-humorous 1982 drama about a black 
female philosophy professor's search for a more complete sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 21 and 22, Pearl Bowser, a film archivist, will discuss the work of 
black women filmmakers in general. She will present a documentary by D. Elmina 
Davis, "Omega Rising: Woman of Rastafari." The film explores decolonization and 
raises questions about race and identity. 
</P>
<P>
The series concludes on Oct. 28 and 29 with works by Ayoka Chenzira, a film and 
video artist in New York, who writes, directs, edits and markets her films. 
</P>
<P>
The first two Sunday shows -- this week and Oct. 21 -- will be at 2 p.m. at the 
Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and the third Sunday show will be at La Casa De La 
Raza, also at 2 p.m. All the Monday shows, this week and Oct. 22 and 29, will 
be at 8 p.m. at Isla Vista Theater, at UC Santa Barbara. Tickets, $5, are 
available at the door. For information (805) 893-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic arts films will be shown at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History 
on Thursday nights throughout October. Two films concerning the people of 
Oceania will be shown at the Fleischmann Auditorium at 8 tonight. Suggested 
donation for the films is $6, $2 for seniors and students. Call (805) 682-4334. 
</P>
<P>

In the early '60s, Frankie and Annette, Gidget and Moondoggie may have been 
nerds but they were right about one thing -- the beach in Southern California 
was the happening place to be. Hawthorne's Beach Boys provided the soundtrack 
for all that sun, surf and sand heard around the nation. The band sold a 
zillion records, and a million people decided it would be fun, fun, fun to move 
here, here, here. 
</P>
<P>
Who wouldn't? Hot weather, hot waves, hot sand and hot cars. "Nah, I'd rather 
freeze and shovel snow." Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago there was plenty of free parking, uncrowded beaches, 
better waves, no broken glass (beer came in cans then) and even the lifeguards 
were cool. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing at the beach that is the same now is the sand, and of course 
those developers who would consider replacing the sand with all manner of 
cement. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, lifeguards get skin cancer from raw sewage and everybody else gets 
skin cancer from that warm California sun. The beach is paved with 
triple-your-weight litter, the parking lot is paved with broken glass and it 
costs four bucks to park. You have to leave the day before to get a parking 
spot, but it doesn't matter because there's no place to park anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Beach Boys keep singing those good ol' songs about those good 
ol' days that have been gone longer than Brian Wilson's falsetto. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, before "Apocalypse Gidget" came to the beach, the Beach Boys used to 
play around these parts quite often. They played in 1962 a couple of times at 
The Roller Gardens in Wagon Wheel Junction, reportedly for gas money. Another 
time in 1964, they played at the Earl Warren Showgrounds with The Kingsmen -- 
all in red dinner jackets -- who did the nasty version of "Louie Louie." 
</P>
<P>
No more gas money in 1990. The Beach Boys' concert Saturday at the spiffy, 
tree-lined Santa Barbara County Bowl is a fund-raiser for Project Teach and 
Tomorrow's Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Education needs a lot of help," said lead singer Mike Love in a recent 
telephone interview from Lake Tahoe. "Project Teach creates a fund to help 
people who want to become teachers, not just elementary or high school or 
college, but just teachers in general. Santa Barbara City College already has 
its own program in place. This concert will be a benefit for both programs." 
And Love, who lives in Santa Barbara, is obviously concerned with much larger 
issues than pay parking at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Improving education is not solely a monetary issue. Minorities, for example, 
need more positive role models -- we need more minority teachers. Collectively, 
better education affects the nation's and the world's economies by creating a 
more creative and a more productive economy." 
</P>
<P>
Opening will be Jesse Colin Young, and other guest stars are expected. Wouldn't 
it be nice? Sure, but don't hold your breath for Brian Wilson. He only shows up 
irregularly for the band's gigs. He's probably been stuck in traffic since 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
The Beach Boys, Jesse Colin Young and others will perform a benefit concert for 
Project Teach at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, 1122 N. Milpas St. at 5 p.m. 
Saturday. Ticket prices range from $18 to $50. For tickets or more information, 
call 966-2727.

NO GERMANNESS; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER ARTS GROUP OFFERS A LIGHTHEARTED, COMIC, ENTERTAINING, FARCICAL VERSION 
-- ONE DIVESTED OF ITS TRAGEDY AND IMPORTANCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Touted as a rare opportunity to see both parts of a seldom-staged German 
classic, the UC Santa Barbara production of Goethe's "Faust" will leave purists 
and professionals disdainful. The version at the school's Main Stage Theater, 
presented by Theater Arts Group, is a lighthearted, comic, entertaining, 
farcical "Faust," divested of its Germanness, its tragedy and its importance. 
</P>
<P>
Substance is nearly always sacrificed for entertainment value, as though the 
subject were so dull that patrons would have to be chained to their seats 
unless adolescent high jinks were happening onstage, at all times. 
</P>
<P>
God is a clown; a wrinkled old woman plays Helen of Troy; the Devil comes on as 
a cute, red-eyed hand puppet; there are Halloween witches and neo-punk 
transvestite dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Why is there a potluck of accents? Why is the dramatically critical promenade 
scene in Martha's garden staged at far stage right, when the unusually wide 
span of the stage renders it so remote that a third of the audience must crane 
their necks to see it? Is the intrusive racket of hard-soled shoes hitting the 
stage, in the ensemble scenes, deliberate or an oversight? When the Heinz 57 
Varieties costuming includes 1990 college kids wearing their own clothes, how 
can theatricality do anything but fizzle like an embarrassed balloon? 
</P>
<P>
Rather than evoking faith that a studied eclecticism is at work here, these 
disparities jar and leave the tinny taste of amateurism -- of an idea 
unfinished, of a homunculus better left bottled. 
</P>
<P>
If this were a little ragtag community group trying its ambitious best, one 
could overlook a few things, but this is TAG, which in the last nine years has 
built a well-deserved reputation for high production values and fine acting. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fine acting is still evident. Simon Williams is completely in 
control of his sardonic Mephistopheles -- there is some delightful nuance of 
speech and gesture -- and it's a marvel to see an actor who can strut while 
limping on a cloven hoof. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Egan's polished and studied Faust is enhanced by his beautiful stage 
voice -- sending ringing Shakespearean tones clearly to the last row. He just 
seems to be in the wrong play. Geoff Pywell stands out as Wagner, Faust's 
assistant, though the sudden introduction of an English accent is unaccounted 
for. 
</P>
<P>
One might as well try to take the American out of "Huckleberry Finn," as delete 
all references to Germany in "Faust." There are other odd deletions. Such as 
the scene where Faust decides to end his life and actually lifts the poison to 
his lips. 
</P>
<P>
Here, in Peter Lackner's adaptation, when Faust meets Mephisto, there seems 
scarcely any reason why he should wager his soul, except as a lark. Faust 
appears mildly bored -- instead of desperately tortured with nothing more to 
live for. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of dramatic tension is furthered by Stuart Adkins' utilitarian 
translation, which uses terms like "every which way," "wholesale and retail," 
"cash box" and "Daddykins." There is little rhyme, no poetry; the significant 
change of style that differentiates Part One and Part Two in the original is 
missing. It clangs on the ear the way the New American version of the Bible 
does to those who prefer the King James. 
</P>
<P>
Though cutting a 22-hour play to 3 1/2 hours can never end in a satisfactory 
product, the greatest loss seems to be Goethe's grand design in the mystical 
mirroring of Part One and Part Two -- here the second part simply becomes a 
string of unrelated incidents with no deep mystical or artistic tie to the 
first part. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, a big green paper monster spitting Halloween devils and stage smoke 
from its maw is pushed on stage to collect Faust's soul, but spectacle and 
bathos do not make up for the loss of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
That's it in a nutshell. Rob "Faust" of its mystery and its poetry and you also 
rob it of its soul. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
'Faust" plays at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and at 2 and 8 p.m. Sunday, at the 
Main Stage Theatre, UC Santa Barbara, followed by a two-month tour to Northern 
and Southern California cities. Translation by Stuart Adkins. Stage adaptation 
and direction by Peter Lackner. Presented by TAG, Theatre Artists Group. 
Tickets $8 general, $7 students. For further information call 893-3241.

THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS APPROVED NEW CLEAN-AIR REGULATIONS THAT ARE A 
WAY TO PHASE OUT OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Since I learned last month that smog had come to Ventura County and that it 
speeds the aging process in our hearts and lungs, I've become really interested 
in possible solutions to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
You've perhaps read by now that this state, in the person of Gov. George 
Deukmejian's appointees to the California Air Resources Board, just had some 
hearings on regulations to require sales of low-pollution and electric cars and 
low-pollution fuels -- with a phase-in starting soon. 
</P>
<P>
The board's staff had done an environmental audit, found our state's air to be 
the most polluted in the land and found that "mobile sources" bear two-thirds 
of the blame. During the 20 years of the air board's existence, it has cut 
pollution emanating from cars by 90% from 1967 levels. Meanwhile, the number of 
vehicles has doubled, returning smog levels to roughly where they were before. 
</P>
<P>
I researched the proposed regulations. Buried in them was a string of numbers 
that pointed toward a 60% cut in petroleum consumption. And auto dealers' would 
be prohibited from selling vehicles that pollute. (Note: These regulations were 
thought up before the Iraqi invasion.) 
</P>
<P>
I went down to the hearings in Los Angeles expecting some fireworks. I even 
took the bus -- politically correct, but no fun, alas. The Air Resources Board 
sat on the dais. Eight men and women who looked like an audition session for 
"All the President's Men" -- characters to be interviewed by Woodward and 
Bernstein. Facing them in the hearing room was an army of 200 auto industry and 
oil lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
From the sideline chairs, a platoon of government experts filed to the 
microphone to make their case for cleaning up the air and weaning ourselves 
from dependence on petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
Then business had its say about the proposed new regulations. There was polite, 
somewhat grudging acceptance of principals but an undertone of what Bart 
Simpson calls "an attitude." Their last spokesman said this was an "illegal 
taking," and unconstitutional and contrary to sound business practice and, 
anyway, California had no authority to make such laws. (Note for readers: Ours 
is the only state that regulates clean air. The others leave it up to the 
Environmental Protection Agency in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, the whole board sat in silence and the spokesman waited by the 
podium for questions. Finally, a member -- on the far right from where I sat -- 
said of the last lobbyist's salvo, "I'm very impressed by the logic of your 
argument." He was San Diego County Supervisor Brian Billbray, from a "Navy" 
district. I braced myself for an episode wherein he would fix his fellow board 
members in his manly gaze and launch into a spirited recapitulation of the oil 
and auto industry spokesmen's spirited and persuasive appeal. 
</P>
<P>
But instead he paused briefly and said, "I'm going to have to compare your 
argument to one I heard last night at home . . . my son's excuses for not 
eating his peas." 
</P>
<P>
The board then voted 8 to 0 in favor of its new regulations. Since that vote, 
only a fortnight ago but, to me, an era ago, New York's State Assembly adopted 
a similar plan, Sacramento's public utility voted to eliminate all fossil fuel 
use in 30 years and the U.S. government began to investigate oil company 
gouging in this time of crisis. And this week, Congress wrote these new 
California regulations into the pending Federal Clean Air Act. Of course, 
Detroit's congressman, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) declared war against the 
measure, but that is for a different column. 
</P>
<P>
My fix on all of this: We Americans found out about cancer and cut down 
smoking. Our people wanted to change their habits. The new auto and fuel 
regulations passed in California have not banned cars -- just mandated a 
phase-out of pollutants that we put into them and thence into our environment. 
</P>
<P>
These Air Resources Board measures are being described in this paper and in 
other papers as revolutionary. No. Like the events of 200 years ago in this 
country, such revolutions, to paraphrase Henry Steele Commanger, occur first in 
the hearts of the people and then among the politicians. The board's vote 
ratified a revolution. In California at least, we're growing up. We've already 
begun to eat our peas.

<P>
An abundance of warm weather has speeded up the local apple crop. The apple 
season, which usually stretches into December, is already in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is very early this year because of the heat," said grower and 
packer Bunny Varn of the Apple Stop in Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
Varn, one of North County's major apple producers, specializes in unusual, 
low-chill varieties. 
</P>
<P>
"Apples like chilly weather," she said, "but the ones we grow do fine without 
the winter chill." 
</P>
<P>
Annas, galas, Braeburns, Jonathans, Fujis and Mutsus are among the myriad 
varieties grown under North County skies. 
</P>
<P>
Varn grows nine varieties from around the world. She stopped using pesticides 
and commercial fertilizers more than 12 years ago, and uses no sprays on her 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she is particularly excited about the Braeburn, a tart, New Zealand 
apple new to Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
Among other varieties, Varn favors the Anna, a firm, semisweet apple developed 
in Israel. "It's ideally suited for this area, since we don't have a late frost 
like they do up north," she said. "It starts blooming at the end of January and 
produces at the end of June." So well-suited is the Anna to Valley Center's 
unique microclimate that it yields a second crop in October. 
</P>
<P>
The green Granny Smiths -- discovered in Australia in the mid-19th Century -- 
are firm in texture and tart in flavor. They are ideal for cooking, baking and 
making juice, Varn said. 
</P>
<P>
Another native of "down under," the sweet and crisp gala from New Zealand, has 
also adapted well to the area and should be available through December, weather 
permitting. 
</P>
<P>
The Criterion, a golden delicious variety, is firm and juicy. It also enjoys a 
lengthy growing season, from October to spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Fuji, a Japanese variety, is also gaining in popularity among American 
consumers. It's sweet and retains its crispness for several months in cold 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
The Apple Stop also produces red delicious (the variety that accounts for half 
the U.S. apple harvest) as well as golden delicious and Dorsett golden. 
</P>
<P>
Zeb and Gini King operate the King Ranch orchard in Valley Center and take 
their apples to area farmer's markets. King, who retired as a music professor 
at Cal State Los Angeles, sings the praises of Granny Smiths, red delicious and 
Parkdale beauties. He planted his first trees in 1981: "I wanted something to 
do that would keep me busy all the time. I got more than I bargained for." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Kings, Leo and Jane Johnson sell their apples at area markets. They 
split their time between orchards in Valley Center and Ranchita, at the foot of 
Palomar Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
For Jane, who grows 16 kinds of apples, the mildly tart Jonathan remains a 
favorite. "It reminds me of my childhood in the Midwest," she said wistfully. 
"Many of my customers feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than doing the rounds of farmer's markets, Lewis and Jan La Dou of 
Julian Apple Mountain Orchard in Julian have come up with a different way of 
marketing their apples. 
</P>
<P>
For the past nine years, about 400 apple lovers have been able to "rent" a tree 
from their 70-year-old orchard, which is planted mainly with red and golden 
delicious, Romes and MacIntosh apples. Although the 1990 crop is already spoken 
for, La Dou is accepting tree reservations for the 1991 harvest on a 
first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
"People get really attached to their tree, and they return to harvest it year 
after year. Some even use rented trees as Christmas gifts," said La Dou, who 
keeps renters informed of the status of their crop throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Apples are ripening fast because of the drought conditions of the past four 
years," La Dou said. "Anyone who wants to buy Julian apples this year had 
better come as soon as possible because they're going fast. It gets crazy 
around here during Apple Days." The annual festival lasts through October. 
</P>
<P>
Like the La Dous, the Hall family of Apple Lane Orchards sells only locally 
grown fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a fancy setup like other Julian orchards," said Mary Hall, who runs 
the five-acre operation with her husband, Don. "We're just a small family 
orchard, and we sell only what we grow." She expects to sell Jonathans, red and 
golden delicious, Winesaps and Granny Smiths through November. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to picking and packaging their own apples, the Halls slice and peel 
the fruit for several pie companies in town. They also make cider every 
Thursday, which the public is invited to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Choose apples that are firm in texture and bright in color. The natural white 
dots on the skin, or lenticels, allow the apple to "breathe." Avoid apples that 
show brownish bruise spots or withered flesh -- this is a telltale sign that 
the apples have remained too long on the shelf. Some apples can keep for months 
in controlled-atmosphere storage, a refrigeration process that reduces the 
amount of oxygen and slows the fruit's natural ripening process. 
</P>
<P>
Galas and Braeburn are best eaten out of hand. The Empire tends to become mushy 
when cooked and is well suited for applesauce, while the Fuji and Mutsu are 
all-purpose apples. The dark red Winesaps, which prefer cooler weather, are 
ideally suited to baking and cider, as are Jonathans. The golden delicious 
flesh stays white longer than other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent darkening of the flesh on a cut apple, rub the cut with lemon juice. 
Apples are a good source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, potassium and Vitamin 
C. 
</P>
<P>

MONTEREY PARK: POLICE SAY THE CALLERS ASK FOR MONEY FOR THE POLICE OFFICERS 
ASSN. WIDOWS AND ORPHANS FUND. THE ASSOCIATION DOESN'T EVEN HAVE SUCH A FUND.

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are warning residents to be wary of a telephone scam in which callers 
claim to be collecting money for the widows and orphans fund of the Monterey 
Park Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Wes Clair, president of the association, said his group is not 
soliciting contributions and has no connection to the salesmen, who in the last 
month have requested donations ranging from $35 to $125. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys will say anything to get money out of people," said Clair, adding 
that in one instance a caller even identified himself as a Monterey Park police 
sergeant. "The only difference is some are greedier than others." 
</P>
<P>
The police association does not have a widows and orphans fund. 
</P>
<P>
Clair described the operation as a "boiler-room" scam, in which callers pass 
themselves off as representatives of different police agencies depending on the 
community they are targeting. 
</P>
<P>
In return for pledging a donation, the victim receives a package -- delivered 
c.o.d. -- in an envelope bearing the name of various police journals, Clair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In one $125 package Clair intercepted at a United Parcel Service office, there 
was a discount coupon from a rental car agency, a commendation from an 
international police union, a brochure on law enforcement and a sticker 
reading, "I support my police." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crock," Clair said. 
</P>
<P>
In Monterey Park, police have received 30 to 40 complaints from residents 
suspicious of the phone solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
However, no one has yet come forward to say they were defrauded. Even the 
intended recipient of the $125 package shied away from pressing charges, Clair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the California Police Officers Assn., whose logo appears on 
one of the envelopes seized by Clair, said she was not aware of the problem and 
vowed to investigate the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we don't condone this type of misrepresentation," said Leslie 
McGill, communications and marketing manager for the 69-year-old organization. 
"The last thing we want is to tarnish our reputation."

PASADENA'S BICYCLE TASK FORCE TO PUSH THE METTLE OF THE PEDAL

<P>
The City of Roses wants to attract pedals as well as petals. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jess Hughston wants Pasadena to be bicycle-friendly, so the city now has 
a Bicycle Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Created on Tuesday by the city directors at Hughston's urging, the task force 
will develop plans to improve bicycling around the Rose Bowl, make Pasadena 
streets more accessible and safer for bicyclists, create a bike path through 
the Arroyo Seco and encourage bicycle commuting in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Hughston took to the streets in July with 50 other riders to promote bicycling 
during the Mayor's First Occasional Bike Ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a racer or any of that thing," said Hughston, who regularly rides a 
thick-tired 21-speed mountain bike that he concedes rarely sees a trail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to ride," he explained. "And I seldom have to repair flat tires."

REAL ESTATE DOWNTURN HITS HOME; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTIES: A SURVEY OF SAN GABRIEL VALLEY REAL ESTATE BOARDS SHOWS A 30% DROP 
IN SALES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It all started when Dean Borton was suddenly, as he put it, "blessed with early 
retirement." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the public relations firm Borton worked for, "gearing down" for 
some expected losses, decided to give the 64-year-old copywriter a head start 
on his Golden Years. 
</P>
<P>
Borton and his wife Meredith had a plan. They'd sell their Diamond Bar house at 
a nifty profit, they thought, and go back home to a lake in Michigan, where the 
living is cheap and unstressful. 
</P>
<P>
The Bortons had bought the house -- a stucco-walled hillside home with a shake 
roof, a swimming pool shaped like a big footstep and a scintillating view of 
the San Gabriel Mountains -- for $160,000 in 1984. Considering the way property 
values had risen in the late 1980s in the San Gabriel Valley, they figured 
they'd sell for $290,000. Easy. 
</P>
<P>
That was in January. Since then, they've dropped the price by $10,000, gone 
into escrow twice -- both sales fell through -- and taken over the brokerage 
duties themselves. And still the house is unsold. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, after Meredith goes off to her job at a direct marketing firm, Dean 
busies himself manicuring an already weed-free yard and thinking about that 
lake in Michigan. "I'm getting a little edgy," he says. "I'm at the point now 
where I'm going to have to find something else to keep my nimble mind busy." 
</P>
<P>
The real estate downturn, which has thrown a wet blanket on the housing market 
all over the United States, has arrived with a vengeance in the San Gabriel 
Valley. Interviews with agents and brokers show: 
</P>
<P>
* Houses -- particularly in the $300,000 to $500,000 range -- have been 
languishing with "For Sale" signs on their front lawns for a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
* The infusion of foreign capital, particularly from Asia, that kept the San 
Gabriel Valley market hot through most of the 1980s has slowed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
* Houses that do sell are often going for far less than equivalent houses sold 
for a year ago. Brokers say that there is a widening gap between asking price 
and selling price. 
</P>
<P>
Except in the low end of the market, in which houses sell for under $200,000, 
buyers are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Most real estate agents don't like talking about the down side of their 
business. "We're talking ourselves into a recession," said broker Alex Turner, 
a former president of the East San Gabriel Valley Board of Realtors. "Marginal 
people are being scared out of the market because there's too much negative 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
But a survey of the real estate boards in the San Gabriel Valley shows that, 
for the first nine months of 1990, sales are down throughout the region by 30%, 
compared with the equivalent period last year. At the same time, the inventory 
of properties for sale has risen dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"Weekend open houses are really dead," said Diamond Bar City Councilwoman 
Phyllis Papen, an agent for Remax Diamond Bar. "What you get are not buyers but 
escrow company representatives and lenders, coming by with cookies and cold 
drinks" to drum up business for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Most real estate brokers expect the slowdown to last well into next year, when 
the San Gabriel Valley's strengths will begin to assert themselves again. 
</P>
<P>
Some agents say they're experiencing a normal cyclic downturn after several 
years of soaring prices, just as in any financial market. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't worry when the stock market has a tremendous surge, then settles 
back to a reasonable advance," said Jack Newe, broker-owner of Century 21 E-N 
Realty in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, prime properties in the region were being snapped up as soon as 
they went on the market. Real estate agents talk fondly now of the go-go years, 
when some houses got seven or eight offers on the day the "For Sale" signs went 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, everybody has horror stories about houses that won't sell. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Esther Schuster just sold their house in a well-to-do neighborhood 
in western Pasadena after it was listed for a year and a half. The couple and 
their two children moved to a bigger house in the same neighborhood in May 1989 
and started paying two mortgages, expecting the first house to sell pretty 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling we'd sell it by the end of the year and get about $700,000 for 
it," said Schuster, a manufacturer of biodegradable paper products. 
</P>
<P>
They finally closed the deal for the house in September, selling it for 
$560,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some real estate agents say the situation appears to be more than a simple 
market adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just affecting realtors, it's affecting banks," Papen said. "The 
market is tightening up on home equity loans and bridge loans. 
</P>
<P>
"You used to be able to get a home equity loan, then go out and buy a second 
piece of property. But those are a lot harder to get now." 
</P>
<P>
There is still a strong market for "starter" houses, agents say. "If there is 
such a thing as a $150,000 house, it'll sell -- yesterday," said Monrovia 
broker George Baker. 
</P>
<P>
But "move-up" sellers -- those seeking to cash in on middle-level properties in 
order to move up to a larger, more expensive house -- are finding buyers 
scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"About two thirds of our sales are in the move-up category," said William 
Podley, president of the Pasadena-based Podley Caughey &amp; Doan Associates. 
"We're especially active in the $300,000 to $1 million range. Our sales are off 
by more than 30%." 
</P>
<P>
"There are three elements to a sale -- a buyer, a seller and financing," said 
Newe. "We've got interest rates at less than 11%, and there are sellers willing 
to sell. But the buyers -- they're holding back, convinced that bad times are 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Others are convinced that the buyers are out there. The secret to finding them 
is "proper pricing," real estate agents say. 
</P>
<P>
"The sellers are going through a re-education process," said Fran 
Barrington-Dryden, an agent for Coldwell Banker in San Marino, who expects her 
income to be the same this year as it was last year. "Of course, they all hoped 
that prices would continue to escalate. But they just couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little shock to them to think that a house four doors down sold a year 
ago for $100,000 more than they can get now." 
</P>
<P>
Few sellers are actually losing money, Barrington-Dryden and others say. 
They're just reaping lower profits than 1988 sellers pulled in. 
</P>
<P>
The Schusters, for example, conceded that they sold their Pasadena house at a 
profit. They had bought the house 10 years ago for $230,000, and they sold it 
for twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a good profit on the house," said Schuster. "It's just that it was 
$200,000 less than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Maria DiMassa, an agent with Century 21 Lake Realty in Pasadena, calls that 
expectation of maximum profits "the California mentality." 
</P>
<P>
"People think, 'If my neighbor got $200,000 a year ago, I should get $30,000 or 
$40,000 more. I deserve it,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrington-Dryden says money from Asia is still coming into the San Gabriel 
Valley real estate market. "I have five escrows (for Asian buyers) right now in 
San Marino, South Pasadena and Alhambra," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But like other buyers, Asian investors are becoming more cautious, DiMassa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is just waiting a minute," DiMassa said. "The inventory is good, 
there are good bargains to be had. There's no rush." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers say the San Gabriel Valley's strengths will pull the region 
out of the doldrums sooner than other markets. 
</P>
<P>
There's a plentiful supply of attractive houses in the area; it continues to be 
a market of choice for Asian immigrants, and it's closer to Los Angeles than, 
for example, the Inland Empire or Antelope Valley, both of which have built up 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
As gasoline prices rise, proximity could become the decisive factor, some say. 
"When you're paying $1.35 for regular and $1.60 for super, you're going to be 
looking closer to reduce that transportation cost," said Berton M. Tibbett, 
president of the Pasadena-based Tibbett Group. 
</P>
<P>
The bright side of the picture is the buyer's side. 
</P>
<P>
An Altadena couple who own a dry cleaning business just bought an attractive 
house across the street from a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking to get into a good neighborhood in a house that would 
appreciate over time," said the man, who asked that his name be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of the tepid market, the couple was able to bargain the seller 
down, from $395,000 to $370,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good time to buy, if you can afford to," said the happy buyer.

PLANNING APPEALS CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will now take at least two City Council members to gain reconsideration of a 
Planning Commission ruling, the council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the incident that led to the decision, Councilman David Bodley earlier this 
year asked the council to reconsider a home remodeling approval granted by the 
commission, then voted to uphold the commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Molly MacLeod said Tuesday that Bodley's appeal was a waste of 
time for city staff members, the council and the people who wanted to remodel. 
Bodley said he had questions about the project that were only answered minutes 
before the council met to consider his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Bodley voted against Tuesday's measure, saying it would restrict council 
members.

DEAL WITH CHEVROLET DEALER

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council approved an agreement Tuesday with Colley Chevrolet for the 
company to build and operate an auto dealership in the Glendora Auto Mall on 
Auto Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The city will sell 5.85 acres to Colley for a down payment of about $1.3 
million, $2.3 million less than it cost Glendora to acquire and improve the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Art Cook said the shortfall is in effect a loan that Colley must 
repay at 10% interest to the city's Redevelopment Agency over the next 10 years 
through sales tax on automobiles and by increased property taxes due to 
improvements to the land. Cook said if taxes do not pay off the debt by the end 
of 10 years, the company will face a balloon payment to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Bodley voted against the agreement, saying he was concerned 
the loan may never be repaid.

2ND PARAMEDIC UNIT DENIED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over staunch objections by Mayor William Tarozzi, the City Council on Monday 
rejected a second paramedic unit for the West Covina Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Tarozzi failed to persuade council members to use Redevelopment Agency money 
for the new nine-member unit. The council voted 3 to 1 to postpone discussion 
until the city completes a financial study. Councilwoman Nancy Manners was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the unit's cost were $255,540 to start up and $480,000 a year to 
maintain.

WOODGATE DRIVE BARRICADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodgate Drive will be barricaded permanently just west of Greenborough Place, 
the City Council decided. 
</P>
<P>
The street was temporarily blocked last November, after residents complained 
that motorists were speeding down Woodgate to avoid the intersection of Amar 
Road and Azusa Avenue. Because the temporary blockade significantly reduced 
traffic, residents asked for permanent closure. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people, most backing the closing, came to Monday's council hearing. 
"Before I was living in a freeway, now I'm living in a neighborhood," Frank 
Anselmini said. 
</P>
<P>
But two people who live nearby said closing Woodgate would cause traffic 
congestion on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
Interim City Manager Harry Thomas estimated the cost of closing the street and 
forming cul-de-sacs on both sides at $29,857.

3 FIREFIGHTERS TO BE HIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the recommendation of the recent municipal audit, the City Council last 
week sided with Fire Chief Bart Carroll and unanimously approved the hiring of 
three firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The three positions had been in the 1990-91 budget, but the audit by Hughes, 
Heiss &amp; Associates urged that a battalion chief or captain be hired instead 
to bolster administration and training. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll argued that the firefighters were a higher priority because the 
department has been short-handed in its response to structure fires. 
</P>
<P>
Other audit recommendations that have been implemented: 
</P>
<P>
* Police have increased hours of coverage by parking control officers and have 
started talks with San Marino on a joint dispatch center and with Pasadena on a 
possible jail-use contract. 
</P>
<P>
* The Planning Department will hire an additional associate planner and 
increase zoning enforcement by the building inspector.

WANTED: SALES TAX REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To increase sales tax revenues, estimated at $1.2 million for the 1990-91 
fiscal year, the City Council last week hired an auditing consultant to uncover 
reporting errors by companies doing business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved a one-year contract with Hinderliter, de 
Llamas &amp; Associates of Glendora. The firm, which contracts with 98 cities 
statewide, will receive $300 per month and 15% of any new sales tax generated. 
</P>
<P>
Partner Lloyd de Llamas told the council that the average increase in sales tax 
revenues gained through his firm's investigations is about 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Robert Wagner objected that South Pasadena "has been consulted to 
death."

CABLE TV FIRM OFFERS A CHINESE CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to turn on a new audience of cable television viewers, a local company 
has started offering a Chinese-language station as part of its standard 
subscription package. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty percent of our non-subscribers are Chinese," Alan Kraslow, area 
marketing director for American Cablevision, said Monday at a news conference 
in the company's South Pasadena studio. "This group has never had an interest 
in cable programs. We tried to find a unique channel for our non-subscribers, 
unique to their lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, American Cablevision began offering Chinese-language programs 
produced by North America Television Corp., a South El Monte-based station that 
airs news, music and variety shows from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and other 
Asian countries, as well as local news of interest to the Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the shows were available via satellite only to people willing to 
spend $499 on a satellite dish and special receiver, and up to $200 for 
installation costs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all residents in South Pasadena and San Marino who subscribe to American 
Cablevision -- which costs $20.95 a month -- can watch the program, which 
broadcasts four hours daily and is billed as the primary source of news for 
North America's Chinese-speaking population. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the market of the future," said Randy Campbell, cable relations 
director for North America Television. 
</P>
<P>
American Cablevision and North America Television officials said they hope to 
attract as many as 1,000 new viewers by adding the Chinese-language program. 
Currently, few of American Cablevision's 6,300 subscribers are Chinese, 
although Chinese constitute an estimated 20% of San Marino and South Pasadena, 
Kraslow said. 
</P>
<P>
To solicit customers, the company plans to send mailers in Chinese and English 
to non-subscribers with Chinese surnames, and Chinese subscribers will receive 
bilingual programs each month, Kraslow said. 
</P>
<P>
By December, the cable company expects to have the technology to allow viewers 
to receive the channel in either Mandarin or Cantonese, but only if viewers' 
sets are equipped to receive the dual signals. 
</P>
<P>
Other cable companies from San Francisco to New York are considering adding the 
station, or others like it, to their programming, North America Television 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Cencom Cable Television, a St. Louis-based company that provides cable 
to 16 Southern California communities concentrated in the West San Gabriel 
Valley, is considering adding North America Television to its list of programs, 
Cencom general manager Craig Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 4 million potential Chinese viewers in North America," said Pi Hsou 
Chu, vice president of North America Television. "In the near future we hope to 
reach (cable subscribers) in Washington D.C., New York, Boston, Houston, San 
Francisco and Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
Cencom already carries Chinese programs provided by the Jade Channel, a Hong 
Kong station that broadcasts news, entertainment and soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
But Cencom subscribers must pay $17.95 a month extra for the channel, unlike 
the American Cablevision channel, for which there is no additional charge to 
cable subscribers. In addition, Jade Channel shows are sent via videotape, 
rather than by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Cencom is considering adding the North America Television channel 
in hopes of attracting Chinese-speaking viewers who do not watch the Jade 
Channel.

CLARIFYING DETAILS OF ATLANTIC SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letter from the Willners of Monterey Park about the Atlantic Square project 
(Times, Sept. 30) implied that my firm, Kotin, Regan &amp; Mouchly Inc., is 
biased as the city's consultant on this transaction. Apparently, the Willners 
believe this is so because a portion of our fee is being reimbursed to the city 
by the developer, Champion Development Corp. This allegation is erroneous and 
indicates that the Willners are uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
It is common practice for cities and other public agencies to ask developers to 
share the costs incurred in evaluating developers' proposals. These costs 
often, in fact usually, include consultants' fees. 
</P>
<P>
KRM has supported public agencies in their negotiations with private developers 
for more than 10 years. Within the last few years, KRM has supported and 
participated in highly controversial negotiations with developers on behalf of 
the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches &amp; Harbors, the Santa Barbara 
Redevelopment Agency and several other smaller agencies. In all of these 
engagements, all or a portion of the fees charged by KRM to the public agency 
were reimbursed by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
KRM has never and will never accept fees directly from a developer who is 
engaged in negotiation with a public agency that is a client of KRM. 
Accordingly, KRM has never had any financial or business relationship with 
Champion. It is a shame that such an inappropriate allegation was made with 
respect to a technique designed to save public money yet assure that cities 
have professional consulting support in evaluating and negotiating complex real 
estate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
While I commend the Willners for their community interest, I would urge them 
and all concerned citizens of Monterey Park to understand all the facts before 
judging either the Atlantic Square project or our firm's participation in it on 
behalf of the city.

CLARIFYING DETAILS OF ATLANTIC SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letter by Irv and Ruth M. Willner on the Atlantic Square redevelopment 
project contained a number of misstatements that warrant clarification. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is not an increase in the city's investment of 50% for the project 
as claimed. 
</P>
<P>
This figure focuses on a worst case scenario analysis prepared by the agency's 
real estate consultant. Neither the consultant nor any of the parties involved 
in this transaction believe such a circumstance would occur. 
</P>
<P>
The "loss in security" mentioned in the letter -- i.e. the change in the city's 
financial position vis-a-vis the lender in case of developer default -- ignores 
an important consideration. The crisis of the banking industry has caused 
bankers and lenders to be far more conservative and demanding in placing 
conditions on development loans. As a result, had the city required its 
interest to be superior to that of the lender in case of default, the project 
would be unable to move forward. This would not be in the interest of the 
citizens of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the letter claimed that the report prepared by the real estate 
consultant is biased due to a relationship between that firm and the developer. 
This is an absolutely false statement. The firm worked under contract with the 
Monterey Park Redevelopment Agency and serves to protect the agency's interest 
in this redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the public hearing scheduled for Oct. 29 is not intended to commit the 
city to a deal with Champion Development without public input. To the contrary, 
this date has been scheduled to allow adequate time for document preparation 
and full notification prior to the public hearing.

COLLEGES VIE FOR TEMPLE CITY LINEBACKER'S SERVICES

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Gilmour has always had a dream to play college football, but unlike so 
many other players, the dream is approaching its fruition. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 and 220-pound Temple City High senior is one of the most heavily 
recruited outside linebacker prospects in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour estimates he has already received 200 to 300 letters and mailings from 
prospective colleges -- not to mention countless telephone calls from 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters first started contacting Gilmour when he was a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
The recruiting process can be a grind for some prospects, but Gilmour has been 
able to get advice from his older brother, who went through the process. Steve, 
22, played offensive lineman for Temple City and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something new for me at first," Gilmour said. "To tell you the truth, 
it was a surprise when I first started to receive letters, but my brother told 
me I'd be getting some because he remembered when he started getting recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother helped me a lot because he'd been through it before. Without him, 
it would have been a lot more difficult for me." 
</P>
<P>
But the interest Gilmour received from colleges as a sophomore was merely a 
trickle compared to the attention he has received since last season. It didn't 
hurt to earn All-CIF Division VII honors as a defensive lineman last season and 
make numerous preseason All-American teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The letters started coming in more after my junior year," he said. "Then, 
after those all-star teams came out, that's when they really started coming." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour said he has received the most interest from USC, Colorado, Nebraska, 
Colorado State and schools in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
On an average night, Gilmour said he receives a call or two from college 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
"I get calls almost every night, usually that a coach wants to come to visit or 
maybe just to find out how I'm doing or how my last game went," he said. "I 
don't mind talking about football. I don't mind that at all." 
</P>
<P>
It is the occasional recruiter that gets a little too pushy that turns off 
Gilmour, although he said he isn't afraid to be honest with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they ask me if I'm going to their school and I will flat-out tell 
them if I'm not interested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, though, Gilmour said the distractions of the recruiting 
process have been kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"The recruiting is pretty much handled by my coach," he said. "All I have to do 
is concentrate on my schoolwork, my grades and, of course, football." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour said that grades will not be a problem for him, although he admits 
there was a time when he wasn't focusing on schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't have any problems with that any more," he said. "I've begun to bring 
up my grades and concentrate on that more because I know that's important. 
There was a problem with laziness before, to be honest, but now I'm more 
serious about that." 
</P>
<P>
There has never been a problem with laziness on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being one of Temple City's leaders on defense, he is also a team 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely knowledgeable about football and he's a very intelligent 
player," Coach Jim Walker said. "On the field he makes very good (signal) 
calls, he's very aware of what's going on around him and he's just a great 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said the development of Gilmour on defense has been a prime factor in 
Temple City's success the past three seasons. In Gilmour's three seasons as a 
starter, the Rams are 24-6-1, including a 5-0 record this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt's come a long way from his sophomore to his senior year," Walker said. "I 
think he's grown a lot along with the rest of the program. In no way has he 
reached his peak. He still has a long way to go, but he has already attained a 
lot as a player." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that he has been a starter on defense for the Rams since his 
sophomore year, 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour said he was looking to improve his game before this season started. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the summer I improved my strength and my weight and I worked on my 
speed, too," he said. "I also did a lot of running." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gilmour said he is not as fast as he would like, he has improved his 
time in the 40-yard dash to 4.8 seconds. He also expects to grow another inch 
or two and add weight before entering college. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should fill out a little by the time I go to college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lot may depend on what position he plays in college. Walker and scouts agree 
that Gilmour will probably wind up as a defensive lineman, although he has been 
mostly a linebacker at Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
"Some colleges may think of him as a defensive end but for us he's always 
played outside linebacker," he said. "He's played that for three years and he's 
an outstanding one. But because of his size, (recruiters) probably see him as a 
defensive lineman." 
</P>
<P>
From Gilmour's perspective, he doesn't care what position he plays as long as 
it is on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played some tight end before, but I just love playing defense," he said. 
"I used to play offense when I was younger but I moved to defense when I was in 
Pop Warner (youth ball) and I've stayed there ever since. I just like making 
the big hit on people." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour has also been a success in other sports for Temple City. He is starting 
center on the basketball team and averaged 12 points and 10 rebounds last 
season. He batted .385 as starting first baseman for the baseball team last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I like (playing) them all," he said. "It probably goes in that order -- 
football, basketball and baseball. But football's definitely my sport for 
college." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour led the Rams to the Division VII semifinals the past two seasons, but 
you will not catch him looking past Friday's game against Rio Hondo League 
rival San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been taught to take just one game at a time," he said. "When the 
playoffs come, we'll start thinking about it a little more. That's our ultimate 
goal. But we also want to win every game and so far we're doing pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmour admits that he thinks about his dream of playing college football all 
the time. But as a high school player, he still has a few more goals left to 
accomplish.

FOX WILL BE FORCED TO GIVE SPONSORS FREE AD TIME; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NETWORK IS RENEGOTIATING COMMITMENTS WITH ADVERTISERS BECAUSE 
ITS RATINGS HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF PROJECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fox Broadcasting Co. is falling short of ratings projections and will have to 
give several million dollars worth of free advertising time to dissatisfied 
sponsors, according to industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called fourth network has gotten off to a shaky start after ending its 
third year with a very strong performance. Now Fox is in the unhappy position 
of having to renegotiate a portion of the $550 million in advertising 
commitments made earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
So worrying is the audience shortfall that the network has stopped selling 
advertising time for the fourth quarter in order to use what's left for 
"make-goods" -- the bonus spots given away to advertisers when shows don't 
attract enough viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Fox is performing "considerably below what people had estimated," said Richard 
Kostyra, executive vice president at the J. Walter Thompson ad agency in New 
York. "The numbers have fallen so dramatically that they are using most if not 
all of the available inventory for make-goods." 
</P>
<P>
During the first three weeks of the new season, Fox has attracted 5.7% of the 
national TV audience. Although it pulled in 6.2% of the audience in the third 
week -- its best performance so far -- that is still below the average 7% that 
industry executives said it promised advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be extremely difficult for Fox to hold their guarantees," said Steve 
Grubbs, senior vice president at BBDO Worldwide, another New York ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said: "We are capable of 
making good on our guarantees." He noted that Fox had not yet run new episodes 
for all of its shows and said it was too soon to judge viewing patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, Fox takes a dip in September and October while the networks are 
promoting their new shows, but we build after that," Kellner said. "We're 
comfortable where we are right now." 
</P>
<P>
Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller said the network could handle the current 
make-goods situation without hurting the network's bottom line. "It will have 
zero economic effect on the company." 
</P>
<P>
The networks customarily keep unsold commercial time in reserve for make-goods. 
But with a soft advertising climate this fall, Fox is unlikely to sell all of 
its commercial units. So the network is giving away advertising time that it 
could not sell anyway. 
</P>
<P>
If ratings do not pick up, however, Fox could be forced to run make-goods in 
place of ads it had sold. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Fox aggressively expanded its schedule from eight hours of 
prime-time programming to 12, slightly more than half the hours broadcast by 
the other three networks. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's biggest gamble -- moving "The Simpsons" from its secure Sunday berth to 
take on NBC's "The Cosby Show" on Thursdays -- is still to unfold, but "Cosby" 
already has trounced reruns of "Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
The first new episode of "Simpsons" airs tonight, and how well or badly the 
series performs will be anxiously awaited by Fox executives. Fox hopes that 
"Simpsons" will have a "halo effect" on the shows that follow it, similar to 
how "Cosby" has boosted overall ratings for Thursday night on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising executives said Fox has promised "Simpsons" sponsors, who paid 
between $300,000 and $400,000 for a 30-second commercial, that new episodes 
will attract at least 27% of the TV audience. But reruns since August have 
averaged only 15%, and that has some wondering if the lower ratings are a 
harbinger of how the new episodes will do. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Cosby," which is perceived by many network insiders to be rickety with 
age as it enters its seventh season, has attracted about 35% of the audience 
and continues to be one of the top-rated shows in TV. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the advertisers who bought time in "Simpsons" are major Hollywood 
studios, which paid a premium to reach the 18- to 34-year-old moviegoing 
audience. This presents a major problem for Fox if the new time period should 
fail, since studio advertisers want to promote their weekend movie releases on 
Thursdays and they cannot be switched to another night. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Fox has suffered setbacks in its ambitious expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
The network is behind schedule in producing films for a planned 
movie-of-the-week program for Monday nights, and production delays for its 
animated children's shows are forcing it to substitute planned episodes with 
reruns at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Fox affiliates are on their own for nine of the 13 Monday nights 
through the end of the year, including two during the crucial November 
"sweeps," when ratings for local stations determine ad rates for the next 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Fox substituted old "Tom &amp; Jerry" reruns for its new animated 
series "Peter Pan and the Pirates" while production snafus from overseas 
suppliers held up delivery of the episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Networks customarily take a bullish attitude to predicting how their new fall 
shows will perform. At the same time, they are usually wise enough to reserve 
commercial time in the likely event that ratings don't perform up to snuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy was to sell a lot (in advance) because we anticipated a lower 
demand (later), especially in the fourth quarter," said John Nesvig, vice 
president of advertising sales at Fox. The network generally is considered to 
have sold more of its inventory than any of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Nesvig confirmed that Fox was using unsold inventory for make-goods and did not 
expect to sell much commercial time in the fourth quarter. "We will make our 
fourth-quarter budget," he said.

AS GM PREPARES TO DEBUT ITS NEW SATURN MODEL, EMPLOYEES WHO RELOCATED TO THE 
TENNESSEE PLANT FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE ARE HAPPY THAT THEY MADE 
THE MOVE. 
</P>

SPRING HILL, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a long way from the San Fernando Valley to rural Tennessee, and it's even 
farther from the old General Motors to the new. Are these journeys worth it? 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Rivera says yes, and his opinion is informed. He is among 2,800 auto 
workers from 38 states who have moved here during the past five years to help 
GM start over in the car-building business. The fruits of their labor, a new 
small car named Saturn, will be unveiled today. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera, 34, has been joined by a couple of dozen other refugees from the 
troubled GM assembly plant in Van Nuys, all casting their lot with the auto 
company's brave and costly new undertaking half an hour south of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they were giving up so much. A second-generation Californian from 
Fillmore, in Ventura County, Rivera had been laid off as often as not in the 11 
years he spent at the Van Nuys plant. The scene of endless conflict between 
labor and management, the plant, which builds the Pontiac Firebird and 
Chevrolet Camaro, is considered a prime candidate for permanent shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
On the home front, Rivera and his wife, Patty, a fellow California native, have 
fallen in love with Tennessee. It's a familiar story: a better place for their 
four young kids to grow up, an economy that lets them buy their first house -- 
four bedrooms and a full acre on a country road 20 minutes from work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to be a kid in Tennessee," Rivera says. To counter the lack of 
Mexican food, Patty Rivera has learned to make flour tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
At work, Rivera is part of another familiar phenomenon: a domestic auto 
company's effort to figure out a way to make cars just as well and just as 
efficiently as the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
But the Saturn project stands apart from other efforts along these lines 
because it is an all-American animal. The parts are 95% North American, and the 
car itself is the brainchild of GM veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Key to this, everyone agrees, is the role of employees like Rivera and their 
relationship to the company and to the process of putting cars together. 
Saturn's answer has been to create a decision-by-consensus company that, 
according to the UAW's Mike Bennett, is unique in the world. 
</P>
<P>
A one-time union militant from Flint, Mich., Bennett is president of Local 
1853. His Saturn title, however, is manufacturing adviser. He and a counterpart 
from UAW headquarters in Detroit, Richard Hoalcraft, are full partners on the 
two top policy-making bodies at Saturn, and union members are key players on 
the two other policy boards that make up the subsidiary's organization chart. 
</P>
<P>
That gives union members -- as well as other members of these councils -- 
effective veto power over all sorts of decisions. The UAW could reject a 
proposed dealer for Saturn, for example. But, Bennett says, the union's vote 
isn't wielded that way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're another set of eyes and ears," he says. "Unilateral decisions have more 
margin for risk. This has integrated the union into the decision-making 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously missing from the union's contract with Saturn, he notes proudly, 
is the paragraph in the national UAW-GM contract giving the corporation the 
sole right to hire, promote, fire or discipline employes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking elements of Saturn's personnel system is that, 
beginning in a year, union and non-union employees alike will lay 20% of their 
salary on the line: That is the portion of their income they could lose if the 
cars they build aren't of high enough quality or if other targets aren't met. 
Conversely, they could earn up to 120% of their salary. 
</P>
<P>
The starting point is the wages paid to GM workers at other plants. 
</P>
<P>
This all makes sense to Rivera, who knows the old and damaging habits that 
developed over the decades at American auto factories. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, labor is treated as an equal and not as a burden, as something to get 
rid of when sales are bad," he says. "People are appreciated for their skills. 
Along with that, you take responsibility for your work. In Van Nuys, you don't 
have to accept responsibility. You can just turn your brain off." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera says he is happy to risk 20% of his salary because everyone at Saturn 
faces the same risk and rewards. That is an important distinction to UAW 
members who resent the huge bonuses handed out to top executives even in poor 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger (Smith, former GM chairman) could get by with a terrible sales year and 
still get his bonus," he said. "That won't happen here."

CRUDE PRICES DIVE $1.71 AFTER TOPSY-TURVY DAY 
</P>

In a roller coaster trading day, oil prices soared to a record high of more 
than $41 a barrel Wednesday, then just as quickly plummeted nearly $2.50 on 
profit taking and the unfounded rumor that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had 
been assassinated or overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
But prices of crude oil for November delivery moved back up near the close to 
settle at $38.69 a barrel, down $1.71 from the previous day's record closing 
price on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The volatility highlighted the nervousness that has overshadowed the 
fundamentals of supply and demand in oil markets. "Today's activities are a 
microcosm of everything that's happened since Aug. 2," when Iraq invaded 
Kuwait, said Sal Gilbertie, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. 
</P>
<P>
November crude skyrocketed to a high of $41.15 a barrel in early trading 
Wednesday before beginning a dramatic plunge that took prices as low as $38 a 
barrel on the NYMEX. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of refined products also closed down. Unleaded gasoline for November 
delivery lost 4.66 cents a gallon to close at 93.60 cents. Heating oil for 
November delivery closed down 5.10 cents a gallon at $1.0105. 
</P>
<P>
The fall ended three days of rapidly rising prices, spurred by political 
tensions arising from the shooting deaths of 19 Palestinians in the Old City of 
Jerusalem on Monday and the subsequent harsh speech by Saddam Hussein a day 
later. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little news Wednesday to sustain the high prices. "The market is 
a bit like a hot-air balloon, and it requires fresh doses of hot air to stay 
aloft," said Michael Wilner, president of Hilltop Trading Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's high was a record for oil futures since contracts began trading in 
1983. It also approached the record price for a U.S. grade of crude oil on cash 
markets, where oil is traded for immediate delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Traders believe that record was set Tuesday, when some U.S. grades were offered 
for nearly $42 a barrel, apparently exceeding prices during the last oil crisis 
in 1979-1980 at the onset of the Iran-Iraq war. Records of cash transactions 
during that period are incomplete. On Wednesday, prices for U.S. crude on spot 
markets fell to around $38.70 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's decline began as a rumor spilled over from other futures markets 
that Saddam Hussein had been shot or overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
"No one took it seriously, but (the selloff) indicated that the market was 
looking for an excuse to take profits and technically correct itself," Wilner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plunge gained momentum as prices fell through the $40.10-a-barrel price 
that had been Tuesday's low, then through $39, then lower. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very nervous trading," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at United 
Energy Inc. in New York. "It seems that whenever the market breaks, whether to 
the up side or to the down side . . . the volume comes in very quickly . . . It 
makes for a very exaggerated type of move." 
</P>
<P>
But market watchers denied that speculation was fueling the wide price swings, 
despite accusations to that effect by President Bush and others. On Wednesday, 
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), was reported to have asked regulators to 
look into the way business is conducted on the mercantile exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that a substantial part of the buying all along has been from 
people who actually have a use for either the crude oil, the gasoline or the 
heating oil and that their primary motive or concern in life is having supplies 
to sell," said William Byers, manager of commodity futures research at the 
investment firm of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Current supplies of oil remain adequate for now, analysts said. On Wednesday, 
Reuters news agency reported that Saudi Arabia has managed to boost its oil 
production to 7.7 million barrels a day, up from 7.5 million at the beginning 
of the month and an increase of more than 2 million since the Iraqi invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Production boosts by other countries have replaced all but 1 million to 1.5 
million barrels a day of the 4 million or so daily barrels lost to world 
production under the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait, said Joseph Stanislaw, a 
Paris-based international oil economist with Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear where prices may go from here. Traders normally seek clues from 
weekly oil inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, which 
were released after the close of trading Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But those figures provided no clear signals. Oil stocks in the week ended Oct. 
5 fell strongly, by 4.2 million barrels from the previous week. But crude 
stocks, which normally fall at this time of year as refiners turn large amounts 
of it into heating oil, remain above year-ago levels, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the figures showed an 1.8-million-barrel buildup of gasoline stocks, 
which is expected with the end of the vacation driving season. Stocks of 
distillates, including home heating oil, fell 1.5 million barrels, again in 
line with seasonal expectations.

INNOVATION: 'PLASTIC TAX' COULD HELP U.S. CREDIT LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If we're lucky, Eastern Europe won't reconsider its push toward democracy after 
watching Congress, the President and his 2 Live Crew of Darman and Sununu do 
their rap wild thing around capital gains and deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Taxation is never pretty but, to paraphrase President Bush, read my text: We do 
need new taxes. But not the "round-up-the-usual revenue, inspector" taxes such 
as on income or beer and cigarettes. Or cutesy taxes such as slapping a 
surcharge on BMWs and Acuras. That's more like manicuring the problem, not 
coming to grips with it. 
</P>
<P>
We need taxes that can fairly balance social equity with the financial 
challenge of deficit reduction. We need taxes that are easy to collect and that 
promote the value of savings over the indulgences of consumption. We need taxes 
that remind us that there's no such thing as a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Far more than any other nation, America's consumers have luxuriated in free and 
easy credit. Like that outfit? Put it on the Visa. That cake looks delicious . 
. . Do you take American Express? Credit and charge cards have become the 
currencies of convenience for this country's middle and upper classes. A good 
credit rating is the passport to consumption. Credit is as good as cash. In 
some places, it's even better. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Nilson Report, the authoritative newsletter on the credit card 
business, bank card spending last year approached $243 billion. Oil and gas 
station card spending topped $25 billion. Retail card purchases approached $76 
billion. The Sears Discover card generated more than $11 billion in spending 
and other kinds of credit cards accounted for an additional $10 billion. 
American Express cards worldwide accounted for more than $100 billion in 
spending with more than half of that in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
That's real money. 
</P>
<P>
All told, roughly 13% of consumer transactions are done on credit (by contrast, 
37.5% are cash and 45.5% are check). The percentage of credit transactions is 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the charts of how consumer credit has risen over the last 
decade," says former Undersecretary of the Treasury George Gould, "it's a 
pretty awe-inspiring mountain. It looks like the slope of Mt. Everest." Credit 
card debt rose to more than $180 billion in 1988 from $81.2 billion in 1980. 
Talk about deficits! 
</P>
<P>
Credit is a good thing; too much of it isn't. Should we slap on credit controls 
as we once had in the bad old days? Of course not. But why should credit get a 
free ride? It's time we put a small -- 2% -- transaction tax on credit and 
charge card purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin once said that the role of the Fed 
was to take away the punch bowl just as the party was getting going. A tax 
doesn't take away the punch bowl; it just dilutes it a little so that people 
don't get quite as drunk with credit as they have been. The fact is, we are 
witnessing record numbers of personal bankruptcies. A tax on credit would not 
only raises billions in revenue, it could get people to think twice about how 
they purchase something. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think of this as a sales tax; it's not. It's a "sin tax" on credit. 
Pay with cash or check or debit card and this surcharge doesn't apply. It's pay 
as you go instead of "pay and I'll owe." Roughly 40% of cardholders pay their 
bills on time, says Elgie Holstein, director of the Bankcard Holders of 
America. That means 60% do not. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the idea so long as you don't make it too regressive," Gould says. "It 
appeals to me on the basis that credit card borrowing is really rather a 
free-for-all. . . . I come very reluctantly to the conclusion that government 
has a role to play when self-discipline doesn't work. This area needs some 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a bad idea at all," says Spencer Nilson, the publisher of the Nilson 
Report who has covered the field for over 20 years. "There probably wouldn't be 
any more change than there was when the interest deductibility was eliminated. 
Some people said that would be a disaster, and it didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
The superb data processing infrastructures of the credit and charge card 
companies like the banks and American Express make collecting the tax easy -- 
unlike the challenge of implementing a value-added tax. What's more, since few 
poor people use American Express cards or rely on credit cards, this tax is not 
unduly regressive (Indeed, you could create an exemption for the first $1,000 
of credit spending during a year). Moreover, a 2% tax is designed to nick 
people, not skewer them. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the credit and charge card folks are less than thrilled with 
this idea. "We think it would be regressive," says Nancy Muller, vice president 
of public affairs for American Express Travel Related Services. "We think it 
would penalize lower- and middle-income Americans who rely on credit and charge 
cards to manage their cash flow; high-income consumers are more likely to have 
access to cash that would allow them to bypass the tax. This also penalizes the 
small-business owner who uses charge cards." 
</P>
<P>
"To defend a plastic tax is a complete misapprehension of the way credit issued 
in this country," says Bankcard Holders of America's Holstein, who argues that 
the cards are primarily vehicles of convenience. Convenience, yes. But the tax 
code shouldn't be used to subsidize the convenience of the financially 
comfortable. Most economists and people who understand the dynamics of 
investment and capital formation insist that our tax policies ought to give 
savings preference over consumption. That and curbing the deficit are key to 
reducing the cost of capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that taxes should be aimed more at cutting consumption," says Gould, 
the former Treasury undersecretary. "Don't raise marginal brackets, don't tax 
my saving and investment money too hard -- but tax me when I spend." 
</P>
<P>
A "plastic tax" represents a novel opportunity to raise significant revenue 
without picking the pockets of the poor; it's easily monitored and, most 
important, it sends the signals Congress and the White House should be sending. 
The credit and charge cards are wonderful innovations that transformed spending 
patterns in this country and around the world. They'd be a little more 
wonderful if they helped narrow the deficit.

Troubles at Trump's Taj: Developer Donald J. Trump's Taj Mahal casino hotel in 
Atlantic City, N.J., is not making enough money to meet its $47.3-million 
interest payment to bondholders on Nov. 15, Fitch Investors Service said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the rating agency said, bondholders may seek up to half of Trump's 
equity in the casino hotel as part of a restructuring of the $675-million bond 
issue. "Trump asked bondholders to defer the interest payment in return for 
equity," Fitch said in a press release. "Negotiations are in progress between 
Trump and bondholders."

Semiconductor Indicator Declines: A key indicator of the health of the 
semiconductor industry continued to decline last month, further calling into 
question the industry's hopes for an upturn this year. The Semiconductor 
Industry Assn.'s monthly "book-to-bill" ratio for chips registered 0.95 for 
September, down from 0.99 in August. The measure means that for every $100 
dollars of orders shipped, $95 in new orders were received.

IGGY POP HIRED TO DRUM UP HYUNDAI SALES TO COLLEGE SET

Hyundai does not sell little deuce coupes or pink Cadillacs, but that isn't 
stopping the South Korean auto maker from looking to rock 'n' roll to put the 
beat back in its American car sales. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to reach college-age car buyers, Hyundai Motor America said 
Wednesday that it has hired pop star Iggy Pop for a 20-campus concert tour in 
the eastern U.S. to promote its new Scoupe sports car. 
</P>
<P>
The concert tour, which will run through October, comes as Hyundai seeks to 
forge a classier image to revive sagging U.S. sales. The campaign emphasizes 
the luxury features on Hyundai's stylish new models, such as the $8,395 Scoupe, 
to try to dispel the image that Hyundai builds only low-priced, no-frills cars 
such as the Excel, which the car maker introduced four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But its low-cost reputation has given the Hyundai quite a bit of prominence 
among younger buyers, particularly college students. And it is is a lucrative 
market. 
</P>
<P>
But reaching the college audience is easier said than done, Goren said. Most 
college students do not listen to drive-time radio and they are not regular 
television watchers. But they are avid pop music listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Though Detroit car makers have sponsored such mainstream artists as the Beach 
Boys in the past, Hyundai is being a little more adventuresome. Iggy Pop, who 
will appear with the French rock group Mano Negra, is more associated with 
"punk" rock than the middle-of-the-road stuff. 
</P>
<P>
With its U.S. sales slipping, Hyundai is apparently willing to take some 
chances. Hyundai's share of the U.S. auto market has fallen from 2.6% in 1987 
to 1.9% in the first eight months of 1990.

MESA TO SELL ASSETS, CUT DEBT ALMOST 30%

Mesa Limited Partnership agreed to sell a portion of its portfolio to Seagull 
Energy Corp. in a deal that could reach nearly $500 million and cut debts of T. 
Boone Pickens Jr.'s Mesa by nearly one-third, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms outlined in a letter of intent, Houston-based Seagull will pay $376 
million in cash for the properties, reserves and acreage and assume $50 million 
in liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa also would receive up to an additional $50 million in 1994, based on the 
weighted average price of natural gas sold from the properties between 1991 and 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The deal covers about 15% of the oil and gas company controlled by Pickens. It 
is subject to approval by Seagull's board and is expected to close in December. 
</P>
<P>
"It effectively reduces Mesa's reserves by only 15% yet allows us to reduce our 
net debt by nearly 30%," said Mesa spokesman Jay Rosser. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa's current debt of $1.4 billion would be cut to about $1 billion if the 
deal is successful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The assets to be purchased include Mesa's Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and 
Gulf Coast offshore properties and operations. 
</P>
<P>
"These properties will greatly diversify our total reserve portfolio, give us 
significant reserve positions and exploratory prospects in geographic areas 
other than our historic Gulf Coast area of emphasis, and extend the average 
reserve life of our company's reserves," said Seagull Chairman Barry J. Galt. 
</P>
<P>
Seagull spokesman Alan Payne said the deal would increase the company's assets 
from $391 million as of June 30 to $751 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens said the sale would help Mesa increase "our concentration of 
high-quality, long-life properties," strengthen the company's balance sheet 
and, "through the gas price participation, (retain) a meaningful interest in 
the upside on the properties being sold." 
</P>
<P>
Mesa has total assets of $2.6 billion.

FDIC PROJECTED TO LOSE $6.1 BILLION OVER NEXT 3 YEARS

New projections by the Bush Administration show the fund insuring bank deposits 
shrinking to less than half its current size within three years, a senior House 
Banking Committee member said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s fund for commercial banks will lose $6.1 
billion through fiscal 1993 even if the fees banks pay for deposit insurance 
are increased, said Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), citing projections by the 
Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimates are sharply more pessimistic than the budget office's 
previous projections. In June, the budget office had estimated that the FDIC 
would show a profit of $600 million during the three-year period, Annunzio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayer is in serious jeopardy of being asked to bail out the banks," he 
said in disclosing what he characterized as "little-noticed calculations" by 
the budget office. 
</P>
<P>
The new projections are in the budget agreement reached by White House 
negotiators and congressional leaders on Sept. 30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Watson, FDIC director of research, said the figures as described by 
Annunzio "certainly are pessimistic." 
</P>
<P>
"They are possible, but not likely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They show the fund shrinking to $5.3 billion by Sept. 30, 1993, or only 22 
cents for every $100 in deposits. That is less than one-fifth the $1.25 minimum 
considered safe and less than half the 60-cent level in the fund at the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"These OMB projections are doubly alarming when you realize that they are based 
on economic assumptions that do not include a recession," said Annunzio, 
chairman of the House Banking Financial Institutions Subcommittee.

A BASS-BARITONE PRESENTS HIS MOST ROYAL 'FACADE' IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers music and dance for The Times Orange 
County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1921, composer William Walton and poet Edith Sitwell decided to team up for 
a little "entertainment" to be given at one of the soirees held at the home of 
Sitwell's brothers, Osbert and Sacheverell. 
</P>
<P>
The result -- the stylish, quirky "Facade" for a speaker declaiming Sitwell's 
experimental poems against an instrumental accompaniment -- survived its 
hothouse origins and turned out to be one of the composer's most popular works. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it's even considered sufficiently dignified and "of the Realm" to be 
included on the Pacific Symphony "Royal Gala" concert Saturday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. The concert is part of the Festival of Britain, 
a combination arts festival and retail promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The work will be narrated by actress Lynn Redgrave and bass-baritone John 
Shirley-Quirk. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never done 'Facade' before," Shirley-Quirk said between rehearsals at the 
Metropolitan Opera in New York, where he will be singing Rangoni, the Jesuit 
priest, in Mussorgsky's "Boris Godounov" the night before he sings in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new adventure," he said. "It's not easy. It's very, very fast. . . . 
I'm moderately used to narrating in public, although the balances are totally 
different when you're speaking and when you're singing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sing, you spend more time on a note, and therefore it penetrates an 
orchestral texture better. When you speak, everything is much more staccato and 
short. You have a much greater problem in getting through an orchestral 
texture. The Walton is scored for a fairly small orchestra, which does not 
necessarily mean that it's easy to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes need -- and suspect I will need in Costa Mesa -- amplification for 
the speaking part, but not for the singing parts." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley-Quirk also will sing an aria from Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" and works 
by Ralph Vaughan Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Such repertory, particularly under circumstances of the festival, raises 
questions of whether Shirley-Quirk should be considered a specialist in British 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't I be a British specialist?" he said. "I'm British. There's a lot 
of wonderful British music. Very early on, I got associated with that, and I'm 
happy to have been associated with that, particularly with the works of 
(Benjamin) Britten. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't regard myself as a British specialist anymore. I think more I 
would regard myself as a lieder specialist, if I had to put a label on myself, 
which I would hate to have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Although the program is part of the Festival of Britain, Shirley-Quirk knew 
little about that aspect of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"I am indeed in the dark about the festival," he said. "Even though I'm in 
America, I'm some 3,000 miles away, and I don't know a great deal of what's 
going on. They just contacted me quite recently, about six weeks ago. It fits 
in perfectly with 'Boris.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shirley-Quirk was born in Liverpool in 1931 and began his career as a chemistry 
teacher. Friends who had heard him sing, however, urged him to try a career as 
a singer. Early in those efforts, he was heard by Britten and later went on to 
create roles in the composer's "Curlew River," "The Burning Fiery Furnace," 
"The Prodigal Son" and "Death in Venice." 
</P>
<P>
"Music was always there, all my life," Shirley-Quirk said. "I can't remember a 
moment when it wasn't there. I started singing at the age of 9 in a church 
choir. That was my basic musical training until I got to the university." 
</P>
<P>
But the baritone called working with Britten the "most stimulating experience 
of my life." 
</P>
<P>
"To work with a pair of musicians, Britten and (his long-term companion, tenor 
Peter) Pears together," he said, "I think that was my real music school, just 
absorbing their ideas of musicianship and dedication that are necessary to make 
the work a success."

PAIR CHARGED IN PLOT TO BLOW UP RIVAL NIGHTCLUB

The owner of an Anaheim nightclub and his head bouncer were arrested Wednesday 
in connection with a plot to blow up a competitor's cabaret across town, 
federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Tsu E. Peng, 28, who owns the Palace nightclub, and Harold M. Blaich Jr., 47, 
the establishment's security director, were arrested on felony conspiracy 
charges alleging that they planned to destroy the Ritz nightclub at 507 S. 
Brookhurst St. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our belief that they were trying to eliminate their competition," said 
FBI Special Agent Wylie B. Cox, who is based in Santa Ana. "They thought by 
eliminating the Ritz they would pick up its clientele." 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed in federal court Wednesday, Peng and Blaich 
allegedly devised the scheme to help Peng's financially troubled club at 3150 
W. Lincoln Blvd. The Ritz and Palace cater to Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents said they were tipped to the alleged plot on Sept. 28 when a 
confidential informant was contacted by Blaich, who asked whether the informant 
knew anything about explosives. 
</P>
<P>
"Blaich then told the source that the Ritz nightclub was 'killing' his business 
at the Palace nightclub and that he needed someone to 'take it out,' i.e. 'blow 
it up,' " the affidavit states. 
</P>
<P>
The informant allegedly told Blaich that he knew somebody who might do the job. 
According to the affidavit, Blaich then told the informant that Peng "would pay 
the bomber $500 as a down payment and $1,000 after the job was completed." 
</P>
<P>
Cox said the informant notified the FBI after a meeting with Blaich. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents state that several days later the informant, wearing a tape 
recorder, met with Peng at a doughnut shop near the Palace and confirmed the 
arrangement with the owner. 
</P>
<P>
"During the meeting, Peng (said) the owner of the Ritz had been causing trouble 
for (his) nightclub for a long time and was stealing his clientele," the 
affidavit states. 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent phone conversation with the informant, Blaich was heard saying 
that he didn't care "if the Ritz was bombed, burned or both so long as it was 
disabled from opening for two or three years," the court papers stated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Blaich allegedly told the informant that the Palace's employees 
would get raises if the club gained the Ritz's business. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit states that Peng subsequently gave the informant $500 on Oct. 7 
during a meeting at the Palace. Cox said the money was the down payment to 
destroy the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, FBI agents, Anaheim police, sheriff's deputies and agents from the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrested Peng at the club and 
Blaich at his home in Midway City. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietors of the Ritz could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Peng is being held on $100,000 bail and Blaich on $50,000 bail at the federal 
Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles.

An Orange County Juvenile Court judge gave prosecutors the go-ahead Wednesday 
to try a 17-year-old white youth as an adult for allegedly throwing the piece 
of glass that disfigured 15-year-old Amber Jefferson in what her supporters 
claim was a racially motivated crime. 
</P>
<P>
As Amber's mother sobbed, Judge C. Robert Jameson ordered Kurt David Wimberly 
held in lieu of $50,000 bail in connection with the Aug. 7 brawl outside the 
youth's Stanton home. The incident became a rallying point for civil rights 
activists who have said the attack is evidence that racism is prevalent in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the seriousness of the case and the failure to comply with court 
orders in the past, the court sets bail at $50,000," Jameson said, explaining 
his decision to transfer the case to adult court. "Previous attempts to 
rehabilitate Mr. Wimberly have failed. In fact, he was on a furlough when this 
incident occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Wimberly is charged with felony mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, 
infliction of great bodily injury, and battery. The judge's decision Wednesday 
means that if convicted, Wimberly would serve all of his sentence in state 
prison rather than in a juvenile detention facility. Also, the offenses would 
become a part of his permanent adult record. 
</P>
<P>
After the brief hearing, family members from both sides proclaimed victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, we finally got a little something," said Amber's mother, Cody 
Donnelly. "I feel it should have happened a while back. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Wimberly's relatives and friends also said they were pleased with the ruling 
because the youth will now face a jury trial, rather than the judgment of a 
single judge as would have been the case in Juvenile Court. Also, he will now 
be entitled to bail. He has been held as in a juvenile facility for the last 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said 19-year-old Colleen Gallagher, who said she is 
Wimberly's fiancee. "There's more than a reasonable doubt in this case, and now 
he's got bail, so an innocent person doesn't have to remain in jail." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 7 Amber, the daughter of a white mother and black father, was injured 
in the parking lot of a Stanton apartment complex during a brawl. According to 
authorities, 12 people were involved in the fighting in which youths on both 
sides armed themselves with baseball bats and boards. Amber was the only one 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered an inch-wide gash from her temple to the side of her neck, and 
doctors say it will be at least a year before they can consider performing 
reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Amber and other members of the group she was with say that some of the whites 
in the other group hurled racial epithets before the fighting broke out. But 
prosecutors decided not to file racial hate-crimes charges, maintaining that 
the attack was not racially motivated. Although racial slurs were reportedly 
exchanged, the prosecution said, the confrontation resulted from an argument 
between two girls over a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Wimberly, authorities charged two others in connection with the case: 
Wimberly's father, Earl, 42, was charged with assault and exhibiting a deadly 
weapon, and Trevor McClure, 21, another white, was charged with exhibiting a 
deadly weapon and challenging to fight. The only black charged was Louis Jones, 
19, who was cited for fighting in public and malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Wimberly and Jones are free on bail pending their next court 
appearances. Meanwhile, authorities have issued an arrest warrant for McClure, 
who disappeared shortly after the incident and has never appeared in court on 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Salvatore Ciulla argued Wednesday that the stories from both 
sides are conflicting and that some witnesses have told investigators that 
someone other than Wimberly threw the glass shard that injured Amber. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a street fight. Everything was a reflex to what was going on," Ciulla 
said. "The seriousness of the injury has overshadowed this case to the minor's 
detriment, and I don't think this is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
However, Jameson agreed with prosecutor Kathi Harper and a probation report, 
ruling that the case be transferred out of the Juvenile Court system. Although 
Juvenile Court records are confidential, he cited a previous conviction for 
residential burglary and two pages of violations in Wimberly's Juvenile Court 
file. 
</P>
<P>
Wimberly is scheduled to appear Friday in West Orange County Municipal Court to 
be arraigned as an adult on the charges.

TRIAL: ANNA L. JOHNSON ADMITS CASHING CHECK FROM UNBORN CHILD'S PARENTS AFTER 
SHE'D DECIDED TO SEEK CUSTODY. SHE DENIES TELLING THE TIMES SHE DIDN'T FEEL 
BONDED TO BABY.

<P>
Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson, who is waging an unprecedented battle for 
custody of a baby she bore for an infertile couple, testified Wednesday that 
she accepted payments from the pair even after she secretly decided to keep the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, who has attracted national attention in her effort to win the 
3-week-old boy, admitted that she cashed a $2,100 check from Mark and Crispina 
Calvert in early June and another, for an unspecified sum, in early August, but 
that she no longer intended to give up the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's comments came during aggressive questioning by the Calverts' 
attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen. Van Deusen tried to determine the exact 
point at which Johnson decided to keep the baby, and to imply that she is not 
telling the truth when she claims she "bonded" to the child early in the 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also admitted that the Calverts had made major payments earlier than 
required on at least two occasions. One of Johnson's key claims in trying to 
win custody of the baby -- and one she repeated many times -- is that the 
Calverts breached the $10,000 surrogation contract by consistently paying her 
late. 
</P>
<P>
Crispina Calvert took the witnessstand briefly Wednesday to explain her 
understanding of the contract with Johnson. She stated that Johnson had 
received legal counseling before signing it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a licensed vocational nurse and single mother, testified on the second 
day of a hearing to determine whether she can legally be considered the baby's 
mother, even though she has no genetic connection to him. The Calverts provided 
the sperm and egg from which the baby grew. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding in Orange County Superior Court is now expected to extend into 
next week. Since the baby's birth Sept. 19, the Calverts have had temporary 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
During more than two hours of intense examination by Van Deusen, Johnson denied 
telling The Times in an interview in early August that she felt no connection 
to the baby she was carrying because she knew it did not belong to her. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Johnson told a Times reporter that she did not feel bonded to the 
child because it was not made from her genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been my egg, it would have made a real big difference," Johnson told 
The Times. "But with (in-vitro fertilization), there's no connection to me. . . 
. There's been detachment from the baby from Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson told The Times that the sole reason she was seeking custody of the baby 
was that she believed the Calverts had lost interest in him and would make 
unfit parents. Her aim, she said, was to protect the child from being put into 
a bad environment. 
</P>
<P>
Since she filed suit Aug. 13, Johnson has concentrated much more on her 
"bonding" to the baby, contending she should keep him because the act of 
carrying and delivering him makes her the child's mother. She has virtually 
dropped any discussion of whether the Calverts are unfit parents. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on that change during a court recess Wednesday, her lawyer, Richard 
C. Gilbert, said: "Did you ever hear of a Trojan horse?" 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Johnson admitted she "might have" told someone else earlier in 
the pregnancy that she had not become attached to the baby, but if she did say 
that, it was because she was "in a state of denial," struggling with a bond she 
had developed even though she had signed a contract promising to surrender the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen had Johnson describe a series of events purportedly showing that, 
for many months after she became pregnant, she did not consider the child to be 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
He introduced a sonogram picture, taken Feb. 10, less than a month after 
Johnson was implanted with the Calverts' embryo. Johnson scribbled on the 
photo, "Cris' baby, Day 23," and pinned it up in the nurses' lounge of the 
hospital where both she and Crispina Calvert worked. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's court-appointed lawyer, Harold LaFlamme, also questioned Johnson 
about when she came to feel the baby was hers. He pointed to language she used 
in a July 23 letter to the Calverts, in which she refers to the fetus as "the 
child of someone else" and uses the phrase, "before your child is born." 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote the letter, yes, but in the state of mind I was in, I was confused, I 
was anxious and I was desperate," Johnson testified. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that she changed her mind and decided to keep the baby on June 10, 
at 6:30 p.m., when, she claims, she had to take a taxi to the hospital during a 
round of premature contractions because Mark Calvert refused to give her a 
ride. (Calvert denies that Johnson asked him for a ride.) 
</P>
<P>
But in a string of apparent contradictions, Johnson also testified that when 
she endorsed the June 2 check, she did not intend to give the Calverts their 
child. She also said that when she wrote the July 23 letter, she intended to 
surrender the baby. Later, she testified that by that point she was planning to 
keep it.

NOW, IT'S WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE TOLLWAY; 
</P>
<P>
LAND-USE: LAGUNA BEACH OPPOSES PLANS TO BUILD THE ROAD, BUT THE TRANSPORTATION 
CORRIDOR AGENCIES AND THE IRVINE CO. SAY THEY INTEND TO PROCEED.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the fractious battle between the city of Laguna Beach and the Irvine 
Co. over Laguna Canyon has apparently been settled, the related question of the 
San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor tollway -- scheduled to run through 
the canyon -- remains in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Irvine Co. agreed to sell 2,150 acres of the area known 
as Laguna Laurel to the city for $78 million, scrapping plans for a 3,200-unit 
housing development and several commercial centers. Much of the first 
installment will come through a $20-million bond issue if voters approve it on 
the Nov. 6 ballot. All parties to the Laguna Laurel negotiations agreed to keep 
those discussions separate from ones about the future of the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is in opposition to the toll road and presumably will continue to 
oppose it," Mayor Lida Lenney said. "We foresee Laguna Laurel as a regional 
park," and that would be harmed by the presence of the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
But both the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies and the Irvine Co. 
maintain that the sale of Laguna Laurel to Laguna Beach and its preservation as 
a wilderness area will not affect plans for the tollway. 
</P>
<P>
Although tollway officials have not seen the details of the Laguna Laurel 
settlement, spokeswoman Donna Stubbs said, "we don't think it's going to have 
any effect on us. . . . We'll be moving forward, doing business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the record in the past as having been supportive of all three 
transportation corridors, and that has not changed," an Irvine Co. spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Provision for the corridor right of way was written into the Laguna Laurel 
sales agreement, and the Irvine Co. remains committed to an earlier agreement 
to pay $30.2 million in transportation improvements associated with the 
tollway, a spokeswoman said. The settlement also includes a provision that any 
reduction in that amount as a result of the company's decision not to proceed 
with the housing development is to be deducted from Laguna Beach's final 
payment to the company. 
</P>
<P>
But the future of the tollway is still in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A revised environmental impact report for the project that was released earlier 
this month includes a new plan for a bridge that would span the canyon, 
reducing damage to the environment. The revised report was to be a topic of 
discussion today at the regular meeting of the Orange County Transportation 
Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
So far, grading for the road has been confined to the Aliso Viejo area, and no 
work has been done in Laguna Canyon. The corridor is already two years behind 
schedule, largely because the original plan was written for a freeway rather 
than a tollway. Further construction is contingent on approval of the 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs said she does not think that the scrapping of the Laguna Laurel 
development will necessitate the filing of a new environmental impact report. 
"We used existing (traffic flow) figures that were required at the time" the 
study was initially written, she said. The new agreement "won't jeopardize this 
EIR as far as I can see. The plan was contingent on congestion that we have 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the project are gearing up efforts to block it. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Laguna Beach has hired a consultant to aid its effort to show that 
the tollway would contribute to smog and be otherwise environmentally 
disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney is so opposed to the project that she wrote a letter to the tollway 
authority protesting that the signs along the route that describe it as a 
"freeway" are "false advertising."

PROTESTERS CALL FOR BORDER ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of protesters denounced U.S. immigration policies Wednesday and urged 
Congress to deliver money promised years ago to tighten security along 
America's borders. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen demonstrators from Citizens for Responsible Immigration gathered 
in front of the Federal Building in Santa Ana on Wednesday, carrying placards 
calling attention to what they see as a lack of law enforcement officers to 
patrol U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're here because our borders are not secure. We're fighting 
anarchy here," said Richard Avard, 55, a roofing contractor from Fountain 
Valley. "Mexican laborers are being exploited. As a legitimate contractor, I'm 
competing against the unscrupulous contractor who is knowingly hiring illegal 
aliens. We can't compete. How are we going to compete when a guy doesn't pay 
any taxes?" 
</P>
<P>
Several protesters said their concerns stem from dissatisfaction with 
enforcement of the 1986 federal immigration act. That law provides fines and 
the possibility of jail time for employers who hire illegal aliens. It also 
gave amnesty to thousands of illegal migrants already in the United States and 
authorized more than 1,500 border patrol agent positions. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Davidian, western regional commissioner for the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said that no money has been allocated to hire those 
agents, however. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters said employers have been hiring illegal immigrants because there 
are not enough agents to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are going to have a law, enforce it," Avard said. "If not, get rid of 
it because it's a farce." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Maldonado, 52, who traveled to the protest from her home in Imperial 
Beach, said the issue is immigrants who are breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
"They hear all the things about this country and when they get here, they are 
living in the streets and in the canyons in San Diego," Maldonado said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Mexican-Americans who stopped to observe the protest Wednesday said they 
did not think the protesters had their interests in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's right," said 14-year-old Rachel Gonzalez, who listened to 
the demonstrators with several members of her family. Gonzalez said she thought 
the demonstrators were unfairly attacking Mexican immigrants, who only "come 
here to work, make money, make a better life. Like for me, to be here and get 
an education and go to college." 
</P>
<P>
Lilia Powell, executive director for the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant 
Rights and Responsibilities, said illegal immigrants should not be hired but 
that the protesters were making their point the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a demonstration of that sort does not contribute a solution to the 
problem," Powell said from her office in Santa Ana. "In the long run, they are 
contributing to the anti-immigrant sentiment. . . . We have labor laws that 
deal with (workers hired illegally). These need to be enforced instead of 
making an immigration issue out of it." LUCY CHABOT

NELSON: RESIGNATION IS STRICTLY PERSONAL

<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Robert Nelson, whose resignation was announced Tuesday, said he 
does not have another job lined up but decided to quit so he could devote his 
energy to finding one. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, I'll be exploring whatever options I have. 
</P>
<P>
I think I have some useful skills as an executive that could be used in public 
agencies as well as private agencies," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing his resignation, Nelson referred to a Zen parable used in a 
commercial for a drug rehabilitation center. In the parable, a man hangs onto a 
rock in the middle of a river and allows himself to be buffeted by the rapids 
because he is afraid of what might be downstream. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the fear of what's downstream," Nelson, 51, said. "At this point 
in time, the job here is not meeting my personal needs, and I think I will have 
a better opportunity to find something that will meet my needs if I devote my 
time to doing that rather than devoting my primary energy to this job and my 
secondary energy to finding another job." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, city manager for four years, said the job was demanding and prevented 
him from spending time with his two young children. He said that his two older 
children are in their 20s and that he missed much of their childhood because of 
career obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors had been circulating for several days that Nelson would resign because 
of friction with new council members over Mola Development Corp.'s proposed 
housing development and the city's response to an Orange County Grand Jury 
report critical of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and council members interviewed have denied speculation that recent city 
problems or differences of opinion prompted his resignation. SHANNON SANDS

<P>
After spending more than $1,000 on his City Council campaign, candidate Rand 
Hogan still has more cash on hand than most of his opponents have in total 
contributions, according to campaign contribution statements. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan has received $2,954 in contributions, including $999 from his wife, 
Leslie P. Hogan, and $687 in copying and related services from his employer, 
Boise Cascade Office Products in Rancho Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Hogan has spent $1,062 and has $1,205 cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Harry Dotson has raised $1,878 and spent $1,027. His largest single 
contributor was his wife, Natalie G. Dotson, who provided $490. He has also 
received $1,188 in contributions of less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
The three remaining candidates have each received less than $1,100 in 
contributions, the documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Joe V. Harris has raised $1,017 and spent $815. He loaned himself $1,000 for 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Mayor Edward L. Allen has filed a statement saying that he will not 
spend more than $1,000 on his campaign. And candidate Don Martinez's campaign 
is powered solely by a $500 loan to himself, although he has spent no money 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are seeking to fill three council seats in the Nov. 6 election.

WOMAN KILLED IN CRASH ON LAGUNA CANYON ROAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 39-year-old Mission Viejo woman was killed Tuesday night when her car swerved 
into oncoming traffic on Laguna Canyon Road, police said. Three other people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
June Ruth Johnsen was pronounced dead at the scene of the 10:36 p.m. collision. 
</P>
<P>
Police dispatcher Bernadette Bertsch said Johnsen was driving a white Volvo in 
the direction of Laguna Beach and had been seen weaving on a long straight 
stretch of road just before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses related that (the) vehicle . . . had been driving erratically and 
drove onto the shoulder of the roadway," Bertsch said, reading from a prepared 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen then apparently overcompensated and swerved left into oncoming traffic 
and a Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Bronco, Joseph William Smith, 28, of Santa Ana, and 
2-year-old Bradley Johnson of Anaheim were taken to Saddleback Memorial Medical 
Center and treated for facial cuts and bruises, Sgt. Ray Lardie said. The boy's 
mother, Janine Johnson, 19, of Anaheim was hospitalized with a possible 
concussion and internal injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen's death marks the first fatality this year on Laguna Canyon Road, long 
considered one of the most unsafe roads in the county. But the collision, 
unlike most others in the area, occurred on a straightaway near the center of 
the city, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather was clear and there were no obstructions to her vision," Lardie 
said, adding that Johnsen was estimated to have been driving about 35 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Driver safety on Laguna Canyon Road has long been an issue in Laguna Beach, 
prompting some residents to repeatedly lobby the City Council to beef up police 
patrols and make safety improvements, especially around the notorious "Big 
Bend," where most of the accidents have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the City Council approved a deal with the Orange County Transportation 
Commission that allowed $250,000 in state money to be used for improvements on 
Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
City municipal services director Terry Brandt said the money has paid for signs 
warning motorists of the most dangerous curves. A traffic signal is being 
installed at Canyon Acres and Caltrans will soon begin a long-awaited 
resurfacing project. 
</P>
<P>
Lardie said the signs seem to have helped reduce serious crashes. Last year 
there were 31 accidents but no fatalities. Thirty injury accidents occurred 
this year before Tuesday night's collision, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quiet out there the last two years," Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people have been killed in the last 10 years on the road.

PETERSON, DEAN TRADE SNIPES AT FORUM; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: BETWEEN THE DIGS, THE TWO GAVE STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS TO EDUCATORS' 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS ON A VARIETY OF MATTERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
County Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson and challenger John F. Dean headed into 
the home stretch of their tight race Wednesday night, answering tough questions 
from a large crowd of educators and taking snipes at each other during a forum. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting at a joint gathering of the Assn. of California School Administrators 
and the Orange County School Boards Assn. at the Irvine Marriott, the two spent 
an hour fielding probing questions submitted by the more than 100 educators in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the forum was generally congenial and sedate, each candidate managed 
to slip in the occasional swipe at the other, creating an undercurrent of 
antagonism consistent with their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, 70, is facing his first serious challenge in his 24 years in office. 
He wasted no time in getting off the first shot of the evening. In answer to 
the first question, which asked both candidates about the sources of their 
campaign funds, Peterson suggested that if elected, Dean would be a tool of the 
California Teachers Assn. The association has endorsed Dean, and it donated 
$5,000 to his June primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"In the campaign up to now, we're underdogs in regard to funding," Peterson 
said. "The voters have concerns about positions that have plums to offer -- 
maybe that's why CTA leadership is doing what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign financial disclosure statements submitted last week show that Dean has 
raised five times as much money as Peterson. At the forum, Dean said that about 
half of the $70,000 his campaign has spent for the June primary and the 
November runoff has come from his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, 63, is head of the education department at Whittier College. He took 
advantage of several opportunities to criticize Peterson's record. At one 
point, he accused the superintendent of failing to attend his own cabinet 
meetings, saying that voters should let Peterson "enjoy his retirement." 
</P>
<P>
Dean capped his criticism of his opponent by using his closing statement to 
assert to the audience that Peterson had threatened to drop out of the forum 
unless he was guaranteed the opportunity to speak last. 
</P>
<P>
"That's protocol," Peterson said after the debate, arguing that incumbents are 
usually afforded the right to defend any accusations made by challengers. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the candidates provided straightforward answers to 
pointed questions on their positions on matters ranging from affirmative action 
to drug and gang prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dean pledged to "open the lines of communication" between the Orange County 
Department of Education and the county's 27 school districts. He said he would 
"get a handle" on the department's $74.5-million annual budget, which he 
charged is being poorly managed by the current Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson countered that the way budget money is allocated is severely 
restricted by state law, and he charged that Dean had "not done his homework" 
in studying the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"All you need to do is ask the proper type of question" to learn more about 
budget allocations, Peterson told Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also said that he would make few "dramatic changes" in current 
department operations, although he did say that he would seek more grant money 
to circumvent state restrictions in the use of certain budget funds. 
</P>
<P>
Dean won the June primary by a margin of just 0.3%. The post runs for a 
four-year term and pays $98,663 a year.

FIRE CAUSES $600,000 IN DAMAGE TO NEW BAY-FRONT HOUSE

<P>
An early morning fire ripped through a newly constructed bay-front house on 
Wednesday, causing more than $600,000 in damage and slightly injuring one 
firefighter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Freimann, the owner of the property, said he and his family were just 
about ready to move into the five-bedroom, $750,000 house, which was only two 
weeks away from completion on the million-dollar lot. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out about 2 a.m. on the second story of the single-family house 
on Harbor Island Road, Fire Capt. Ray Pendeleton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of looks like right now that it's probably going to turn into 
something that was accidental due to painters' leaving rags around," Pendeleton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Freimann said the most likely scenario was that paint cans or paint rags 
spontaneously combusted to start the fire. The fire was limited to the second 
floor of the house, but there was some water damage to the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
The injured firefighter was treated at the scene for second-degree burns to the 
back of his neck, Pendeleton said. The house was unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
Freimann, who is the owner of the Ridgeline Country Club in Orange, said in a 
brief telephone interview that he and his family have been working on the house 
for about 18 months. He and his wife have three children, a son, 13, and 
12-year-old twin girls. 
</P>
<P>
The family had been renting a Newport Beach condominium while the house was 
being built. Freimann said the 5,000-square-foot structure was insured. 
</P>
<P>
Freimann's property, which overlooks the harbor but is not located on Harbor 
Island, is valued at about $1.1 million, according to county tax records.

10 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
Years before he helped UCLA beat BYU in the 1986 Freedom Bowl and led the Arena 
Football League in passing while playing for the Los Angeles Cobras in 1988, 
Matt Stevens was leading fourth-quarter rallies for Fountain Valley High 
School. A 5-foot-11, 175-pound junior, Stevens completed four of six passes for 
52 yards during a 67-yard drive that gave Fountain Valley a 22-21 victory over 
Marina in the Sunset League opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
With Fountain Valley trailing, 21-15, midway through the fourth quarter, 
Stevens helped the Barons drive from their 33 to Marina's one and then scored 
his second touchdown of the game. For the game, Stevens completed nine of 14 
passes for 152 yards. Fountain Valley went on to lose to Edison in the Big Five 
Conference championship in front of almost 30,000 people at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>

A friendly war of the words raged between El Modena Coach Bob Lester and Santa 
Ana Coach Tom Meiss. The subject: Which team would Meiss's daughter, Paula, an 
El Modena student, root for? 
</P>
<P>
Said Lester: "Paula is a full-blown El Modena booster." 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter is in Lester's tennis class at El Modena so we had a struggle at 
home all week, " Meiss said. "If we win, he's liable to flunk her." 
</P>
<P>
"As of today, Paula is a straight-A student," Lester said, after his team won, 
27-17, in its homecoming game, ending Santa Ana's Century League winning streak 
at nine.

Bad Omen? Cedrick Hardman's ill-fated career as Laguna Beach High School's 
football coach began with the the Artists winning four of their first five 
games, their best start since 1979. But because of an ineligible player -- a 
lineman who wasn't yet 15, the minimum age for a varsity football player -- the 
Artists forfeited three of their victories. Laguna Beach finished the season 
3-7. Hardman, who was an All-Pro defensive end for the San Francisco 49ers, 
resigned in 1987 after being arrested on felony charges of possession of 
cocaine and on a misdemeanor for resisting arrest. The cocaine charge was 
dropped, but Hardman served 10 days in jail after pleading guilty to resisting 
arrest.

Arm and Hammer: Quarterback Todd Gragnano and running back Erik Mitchell of Los 
Alamitos had memorable performances in Los Alamitos' 58-28 drubbing of Katella. 
Gragnano became only the fifth player in Orange County history to pass for more 
than 5,000 yards in a career. He reached 5,051 by completing 10 of 12 passes 
for 192 yards and two touchdowns. Mitchell rushed for 224 yards in that game.

LOS ALAMITOS PUTS LEAGUE STREAK ON LINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The longest league winning streak in Orange County will be tested at 7:30 
tonight when Esperanza High School plays host to Los Alamitos in the Empire 
League opener for both schools at Placentia's Bradford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has won 20 consecutive league games since losing to Loara in its 
1986 league opener. Among the 20 victories is five over Esperanza, including a 
42-28 romp last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played well against Los Alamitos the past couple of years," 
Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. . The Aztecs' nine turnovers in one-sided 
losses the past two years would attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Alamitos (3-2) has displayed some vulnerability in losses to Servite 
(21-17) and St. John Bosco (21-20), giving rival coaches in the Empire League 
reason to be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"They've always given us problems with great team speed on both sides of the 
ball and they've had Todd Gragnano at quarterback the past three years," Meek 
said. "Plus, they've always had one receiver we couldn't contain." 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano has graduated and the Griffins don't have a linebacker in the mold of 
former standouts Roger Roadstrom, David Thompson or Brian Havens. But split 
receiver Tyler Cashman has been nearly unstoppable, catching 39 passes for 482 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Running back LaQuan Beckton has averaged 103.7 yards-per-game rushing in his 
past three games since recovering from a hamstring pull suffered in the season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (5-0) is off to its best start since 1986 when it finished 9-2-1. The 
Aztecs have allowed an average of 8.8 points per game with linebacker Mike 
Burns leading the team in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Keith McDonald is coming off his best game of the season in a 17-13 
victory over Sunny Hills. McDonald completed 12 of 16 passes for 198 yards. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Esperanza's ground game is among the best in the county. Gerrick Emry 
(72 carries, 411 yards) and Jarod Smith (72 carries, 372 yards) have given the 
Aztecs more speed in the backfield than in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Meeks says the winner tonight will have the inside track to the title; the 
other four teams in the league have losing records. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is well aware that the winner will get the No. 1 seed to the playoffs 
because we base our seedings on head-to-head competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (5-0, 2-0) vs. La Quinta (5-0, 2-0) at Bolsa Grande HS: 
Tailback Ulysses Trammell gained 224 yards and scored on runs of 60, 52 and 26 
yards in a 34-12 romp over Bolsa Grande last week. Rancho Alamitos will be 
playing without blocking fullback Vince Otteman, who strained ligaments in his 
knee last week and will not suit up. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta ended Pacifica's 22-game Garden Grove League winning streak last week 
with a 29-6 victory over the Mariners. Quarterback Donald Hopkins, throwing 
well on rollouts, passed for 233 yards and tailback George Sanchez added 127 
yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
In other games tonight: 
</P>
<P>
Century League: Santa Ana Valley vs. Orange at El Modena HS; Orange League: 
Brea-Olinda vs. Anaheim at Glover Stadium and Magnolia at Western; Pacific 
Coast League: Estancia vs. Century at Santa Ana Stadium and Laguna Beach vs. 
Trabuco Hills at Mission Viejo HS; Sea View League: Saddleback vs. Woodbridge 
at Irvine HS; Nonleague: Santa Margarita at Gahr.

HIGH COURT REFUSES TO HEAR KEATING'S APPEAL ON BAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court declined Wednesday to hear an appeal from Charles 
H. Keating Jr., the former thrift owner now in Los Angeles County Jail on fraud 
charges, to lift or reduce his $5-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas signed an order that simply 
denied Keating's petition. Only two of the court's seven justices -- Stanley 
Mosk and Edward A. Panelli -- voted to grant a hearing on the petition. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's lawyers could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. But they 
indicated earlier that they would take the bail issue to federal court -- most 
likely U.S. District Court in Los Angeles -- should the state's high court 
reject the petition. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyers also could ask Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lance A. 
Ito, the trial-court judge recently assigned the case, to lower bail. Keating 
and three co-defendants are scheduled to appear Monday before Ito to settle 
some procedural matters. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, has been in 
jail since Sept. 18, when a grand jury indictment was unsealed in court. The 
indictment charges Keating and the others with 42 counts of securities fraud in 
the sale of American Continental junk bonds through the 29 Southern California 
branches of the company's main subsidiary, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 people, mainly elderly depositors at Lincoln, invested nearly 
$200 million in American Continental bonds during a two-year period ending in 
early 1989. Many said they moved their insured deposits over to securities 
accounts at Lincoln because they were misled into believing that the bonds were 
safe and insured. 
</P>
<P>
Those bonds have become worthless since the company filed for bankruptcy 
protection in April, 1989. Regulators, who seized Lincoln immediately 
thereafter, now estimate that it is one of the worst thrift disasters ever and 
will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Los Angeles County district attorney's office originally made no 
recommendation on bail, Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner set a $5-million 
bond for Keating. The high bail stunned Keating and his family. Keating said he 
is broke and cannot pay the bail. And his attorneys have argued that his 
imprisonment will make preparation of his defense more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner, however, rejected arguments to lower the bail, citing the seriousness 
of the charges and the danger that Keating would flee. Keating is the subject 
of numerous civil and criminal investigations. A state appeals court also 
rejected a petition to lower bail. 
</P>
<P>
However, some prosecutors and law enforcement officials have said that they 
consider the bail excessive. Had Keating been charged in federal court, one 
federal agent said, he likely would have been released on his own recognizance 
-- essentially on his word that he would return. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that the U.S. courts will do something with this, but I wouldn't 
be surprised if they didn't," said Caleb Foote, a retired UC Berkeley law 
school professor. 
</P>
<P>
Foote, a criminal-law expert and author of a book on bail, said that the bail 
rule is intended to allow defendants charged with serious crimes, but not 
convicted, to be released. Now, he said, that rule is often not followed, and 
the result is a severe clogging of the nation's jails. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed a level of (acceptable) bail to build up 
that is just way out of line," he said. "The court has essentially deprived 
defendants of that clause in the 8th Amendment that says excessive bail should 
not be required."

<P>
Brother International Corp., a manufacturer of sewing machines and typewriters, 
is planning to lay off 40 of its 141 employees here, a company official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Employees in the distribution, order entry and credit departments will lose 
their jobs this fall as the company moves those functions to other branches, 
said Robert Reigrod, senior vice president at Brother western regional 
headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Reigrod said the layoffs are necessary because of the downturn in the national 
economy. "We want to do what is necessary to create a healthy company for the 
future, so we really had no choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brother International is a unit of Brother Industries Ltd. of Nagoya, Japan. 
Reigrod said the sales and dealer support operations will remain in Irvine; 
order entry and credit operations will be moved to the company's U.S. 
headquarters in Somerset, N.J., and distribution will be handled from a center 
in Bartlett, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs will take effect Nov. 30. Reigrod would not say how much the 
company expects to save through the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Standard and Poor's Register lists Brother International's annual 
sales at $318 million. The company also makes knitting machines, printers, fax 
machines and microwave ovens.

ROYAL BRITISH REGALIA TURNS UP IN, OF ALL PLACES, LAGUNA BEACH

<P>
John Harwood never thought to give his grandfather's old British uniform the 
royal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on more than one occasion, the uniform served as his Halloween 
costume. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd collect candies in the hat," Harwood recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the uniform that Harwood wore trick-or-treating is on display at the 
Robes of the Realm exhibit in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. The exhibit, which 
coincides with the Festival of Britain starting Friday in Orange County, 
features British ceremonial robes and regalia, including the investiture robe 
of Prince Charles and, now, Harwood's Halloween costume. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood had no idea of the uniform's significance -- or its worth. He only knew 
that his grandfather, Sir Ralph Harwood, had worn it while serving as treasurer 
to King George V. 
</P>
<P>
Those in charge of the robes exhibit say the diplomatic uniform, as well as two 
additional jackets and accompanying medals not on display, are an important 
find. They indicate that Sir Ralph, as Harwood refers to his grandfather, was a 
key player in King George's court. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe we found these right here . . . ," says Greg McGroarty, 
president of the Robes of the Realm exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
One clue that makes McGroarty think Sir Ralph enjoyed a favored position at 
court is the gold embroidery that covers the front and back of the uniform. As 
a general rule, the more thread on one's uniform, the higher one's rank. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much room (on the jacket) for more embroidery," McGroarty says. 
"He'd have to rank right at the top." 
</P>
<P>
If Harwood finds the right buyer, McGroarty says, he could receive more than 
$500,000 for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid I didn't realize the value," says Harwood, who works as a building 
contractor and lives in Laguna Beach. "My son used one of the jackets to dress 
up like a penguin for a school play." 
</P>
<P>
Harwood's collection found its way to the exhibit after David Battersby, a 
career-guidance coordinator at Costa Mesa High School, heard that Princess 
Alexandra would visit the school while in Orange County for the Festival of 
Britain. Battersby remembered that Harwood, a neighbor, had a British uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we were having a royal visit at my school, I thought we'd show the 
uniform to the kids and tell them what it meant," Battersby says. 
</P>
<P>
Even Battersby, a former world history teacher, looks a little sheepish when he 
admits that he dressed up a fellow administrator in the jacket for a day of 
show-and-tell with history students. 
</P>
<P>
He then wanted to put the collection on display. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted (the collection) insured, and the school informed me they would cover 
it for $50," Battersby says. 
</P>
<P>
When a student told him about the Robes of the Realm exhibit, he decided to 
show the collection to McGroarty to see if he would be interested in including 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked in here with a big case and said, 'There's a robe in here I think 
you'd like to see,' " McGroarty says. "He opened this tin box and inside it 
said, 'Ede and Ravenscroft."' 
</P>
<P>
Ede and Ravenscroft have served as the royal robe makers since the reign of 
William and Mary in 1689 and produced all of the robes in the exhibit. The 
Robes of the Realm collection was assembled in honor of the company's 300-year 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
At first the clothes inside looked like nothing special -- the fine embroidery 
was hidden in the folds of fabric. Then Battersby pulled out a sword with a 
gold handle that also had the Ede and Ravenscroft name. McGroarty knew only a 
diplomat of very high rank would have a sword with a gold handle, instead of 
the standard silver. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my assistant put the jacket on the mannequin, and I saw all of the gold 
embroidery. I realized this had to belong to a really important person," 
McGroarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying medals were also impressive. 
</P>
<P>
They include the Order of the Bath, Victorian Order and Order of the British 
Empire, all rewards for outstanding service to the crown. In addition, the son 
of Queen Victoria honored Sir Ralph with five foreign Orders. McGroarty figures 
that Sir Ralph accompanied the Duke of Windsor to Iraq, Ethiopia, Romania, 
Afghanistan and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"They're worth a fortune," McGroarty says. "I'm amazed there were these medals 
five minutes away at Costa Mesa High School." 
</P>
<P>
One medal, the Order of the Bath, could be worth up to $45,000. Students got to 
hold the medals when Battersby brought them to their classes. 
</P>
<P>
Harwood has two other jackets that belonged to his grandfather, one still 
adorned with a black arm band. Presumably Sir Ralph wore it to King George's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra visits Costa Mesa High School Monday morning, the 
Harwood collection will be temporarily displayed for her benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McGroarty has asked Britain's King of Arms in charge of genealogy to 
research Sir Ralph Harwood's past. Judging from the collection, Sir Ralph could 
have been keeper of his majesty's privy purse -- a kind of accountant to the 
king, McGroarty says. 
</P>
<P>
While the British fuss over the find, Harwood has already tired of the pomp and 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really a royalist," he says. "I want to be me rather than Sir Ralph's 
grandson." 
</P>
<P>
Harwood moved to the United States 11 years ago. His mother brought over the 
box of memorabilia by plane from England three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It set off all of the (airport) metal detectors," Harwood says. 
</P>
<P>
He has picked up only bits and pieces of his grandfather's history from his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a genius mathematician. He used to put himself to sleep at night 
solving quadratic equations," Harwood recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Although some would compare the find with winning the lottery, Harwood is far 
from elated. Once the festival ends Oct. 28, he must decide whether to sell off 
the collection or store it in a bank vault. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be fun. The kids loved to get it out and play with it. My son used 
to put his feet on the (Ede and Ravenscroft) box while playing Nintendo," 
Harwood said. "Now I've got to think about insurance."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: TEACHERS WRITE A GUIDE TO HELP PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their many years of teaching elementary and junior high school students in 
Orange County, Anne Farrell and Jacqueline Watson have learned one important 
lesson they want to pass on to parents. 
</P>
<P>
Your involvement in your child's education, Farrell and Watson say, is the most 
important contribution you can make to fulfilling your child's potential as a 
happy and productive adult. 
</P>
<P>
That's the premise behind "Parents' Guide for Helping Kids Become 'A' 
Students," which Farrell and Watson have co-written with Elaine Dundas, a San 
Diego teacher and writer. 
</P>
<P>
The paperback book (Blue Bird Publishing; $11.95) provides parents with 
specific ideas and strategies on how to help their children succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
"The question parents often ask is, how can I help my child in school," said 
Farrell, who taught for 31 years and recently retired as a resource specialist 
at Niguel Hills Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said she and her longtime friend Watson, a resource specialist at Del 
Obispo Elementary School in San Juan Capistrano, hope their book will become a 
resource guide to parents. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much information in it, just real practical activities to improve 
all the skill areas like reading, math, spelling and writing," she said. "A big 
portion of it is how study skills can be improved, including homework, memory 
techniques, note-taking and test-taking tips." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said her teaching experience shows that the best students usually have 
parents who take an interest in their schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
Her advice to parents? 
</P>
<P>
"Two words: Get involved," she said. "Get involved in their children's 
education, get involved with what's going on in the school, get involved with 
working with the teacher. Supporting the teacher is so important. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's homework, make sure the youngster has a place and specific time to 
sit down and do that homework." 
</P>
<P>
And if a child goes back to class the next day prepared with his homework, she 
said, "he's bound to have some answers the teacher is going to ask him. He's 
not only going to get a better grade, but it's going to build his self-image 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"So often we see kids with poor self-images, and they're kids who don't do 
their homework and don't have any interest in getting things completed." 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, "parents need to start at an early age -- right when (the 
children) first go to school -- and develop these great work habits. Once they 
get to junior high there won't be any fight about it. They'll know what's 
expected of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Parents' Guide for Helping Kids Become 'A' Students" is available at the 
Reading Rhinoceros in Mission Viejo.

O.C. POP BEAT: JUDY COLLINS A PUZZLE BUT A GRAND ONE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To say that Judy Collins sends a mixed message would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Her background is in the '60s folk boom, but Tuesday night she came on stage at 
the new Irvine Barclay Theatre in a shiny, silver-sequined jacket and black 
tights -- garb that virtually shouted "I am not a folkie!" 
</P>
<P>
But if Collins' look was almost ready for Vegas, her outlook was in large part 
a product of those olden folkie-hippie days. Her 80-minute set included hymns 
to love and peace, a misty recollection of Woodstock, a homage to John Lennon 
and, of course, "Both Sides Now," that Joni Mitchell-penned ode to the emerging 
youth culture's dizzy, dancing quest for self-realization. 
</P>
<P>
Toss in renditions of a Stephen Sondheim standard, an a cappella Irish ballad, 
up-to-the-minute adult contemporary pop stylings from Collins' new album and a 
smooth, friendly but unrevealing stage manner, and you've got . . . well, it's 
hard to say just what you've got. Pop cosmopolitanism, maybe. But whatever it 
was, it certainly sounded grand. 
</P>
<P>
If there were a 50-and-over circuit for singers like the one for pro golfers, 
Collins would make a killing. At 51, her voice sounds richer, bigger and more 
brilliant than it did on her '60s hits. Sometimes with the smoothness of a 
Cadillac transmission, sometimes with sudden surprise, Collins would ascend to 
her upper register and hold her notes with an assured vibrato. It wasn't a 
matter of grandstanding or straining for effect. Everything Collins sang came 
with a sense of proportion and exactness, and a focused attention to the 
meaning of what she sang. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting her was a four-member band that was sweet, clean and responsive, 
polished but not too slick. Pianist Joseph Joubert was the most valuable 
player, not just for his sensitive instrumental accompaniments but also for 
excellent, presence-filled background vocals. Zeb Katz provided firm, supple 
electric bass lines, similar to the style that's a foundation of Suzanne Vega's 
sound. Electric guitarist Lou Volpe came up with varied, appropriate shadings 
in his understated solos. 
</P>
<P>
Collins opened strumming a 12-string guitar on "Chelsea Morning" and "Someday 
Soon," songs that found her in good voice but not quite emotionally engaged. 
That missing intensity quickly emerged on "Fires of Eden," the soft-rock title 
anthem from Collins' new album. Deservedly, it received a bigger cheer than the 
more familiar songs that began the show. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Collins mixed lovingly recreated oldies (including a slow, 
melancholy "In My Life," in honor of John Lennon's birthday, and a sumptuous 
"Both Sides Now") with good, new songs. 
</P>
<P>
She turned "From a Distance," which Nanci Griffith has sung with wispy 
yearning, into a muscular yet not strident hymn, posing big questions about the 
possibility of world peace. Collins' "Fortune of Soldiers" was a darker but 
still richly melodic exploration of similar themes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blizzard," a long narrative a la Harry Chapin, allowed Collins briefly to 
link her folk and art-song strands and provided a showcase for some of her 
finest singing. With rippling grand piano, played by Collins, and shivery, 
crystalline touches from the other musicians, the song took on a chilly 
instrumental hue that only served as a prelude for Collins' soaring affirmation 
at the end, when the blizzard lifts, and with it the protagonist's troubled 
emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
A gospel-tinged treatment of "Bird on a Wire" was a bit too polite -- one hoped 
for Collins to cut loose and get a little raw, knowing she wouldn't because 
control is the basis of her style. Her only real failure, though, was a song 
about the Woodstock festival that reminisced with hazy sentimentality about the 
old hippie gathering. Couplets like "Rain, rain go away, we're gonna save the 
world today" should be sung soaked in irony or, better yet, not sung at all. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was nice to be able to sit in a comfortable, acoustically superior 
concert theater in Orange County and realize that Woodstock had some relevance 
for the star on stage. By booking Judy Collins for its second full concert -- 
and the first by a famous name -- the Irvine Barclay showed a willingness to 
embrace music of the rock era. With the exception of one night of Johnny Cash, 
that's something that the Orange County Performing Arts Center hasn't done in 
three years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Barclay's 756-seat capacity makes it ideal for pop performers who 
aren't big enough to play the county's two outdoor concrete slabs and want to 
treat fans to something more formal and conducive to concentrated listening 
than a club full of cigarette smoke and clinking beer bottles. Jazz, folk, pop 
and the sort of rock that's meant to be heard from a sitting position all would 
go nicely at the Irvine Barclay, especially with the prospect of patronage from 
a student population close at hand.

<P>
It will be interesting to see what the nonprofit theater's management comes up 
with to spice a primary diet of dance, theater and classical music. For now, 
it's encouraging to step into a theater that looks like a good place for Tom 
Waits or Ornette Coleman or Ry Cooder and David Lindley to play, and to realize 
that if they would be willing, so, most likely, would the management.

SAROYAN REVIVAL DIPS INTO THE MELTING POT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The so-called American melting pot, that increasingly discredited cliche, once 
held the sort of vigor that led many of the most notable playwrights of the 
1930s to re-create the pot on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
From Elmer Rice to Clifford Odets and from Sidney Kingsley to Moss Hart, they 
celebrated its ethnic splendor, railed against its inequalities, placed its 
contradictions on exhibit and generally beckoned its glorious future. 
</P>
<P>
William Saroyan, for instance, describes the 1939 setting for "The Time of Your 
Life," which is being revived here by the Professional Actors Conservatory of 
Rancho Santiago College, as a specifically "American place." It is a San 
Francisco waterfront bar, home to every imaginable neighborhood type. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish are here along with the Italians and the Arabs. The hookers stop by 
along with the swells. So do the cops and the dockworkers, the sailors and the 
drunks, the newsboys and the con men, the lovelorn and the simply lost. The 
place fairly teems with the species Homo Americanus like a zoo on a quietly 
domestic Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But in fact, Nick's Pacific Street Saloon, Restaurant and Entertainment Palace 
could have existed only in Saroyan's affectionate world, certainly not in the 
real one then or now. 
</P>
<P>
The righteous proprietor of Nick's live-and-let-live honky-tonk pours free 
drinks, takes a strictly fatherly interest in the local hookers, tosses an 
intrusive vice cop on his ear, provides meals as well as work for the 
unemployed and gets regular visits from his white-haired old mother. 
</P>
<P>
And Nick isn't even the hallowed saint of this whimsically meandering, 
post-Depression paean to the common man. 
</P>
<P>
That honor goes to a gentle Irishman with a bum leg, one of the saloon regulars 
named Joe. He sits around drinking champagne, while flirting with the ladies 
and dispensing dollar bills from his vest-pocket bankroll to anyone who shows 
the slightest need of money. Joe's largess goes so far that it extends beyond 
mere acquaintances to anonymous passersby on the street. 
</P>
<P>
When the newsboy arrives to hawk his papers, Joe buys not one but all of them 
and tosses them away unread -- a munificent gesture, both charming and cynical. 
When desolate Kitty Duvall can't make the rent on her hooker's wages, Joe peels 
more bills and pays for her move to a better hotel. When his gofer, Tom, needs 
a fresh start in love and in life, Joe arranges everything. 
</P>
<P>
Because "The Time of Your Life" is virtually all texture and no plot, a series 
of acting "moments" strung out over nearly three hours, the strength of any 
production is particularly dependent on the quality of the players. Meanwhile, 
the very reasons that make it a difficult play to negotiate -- 26 speaking 
roles, for example -- also make it a desirable choice for a training program. 
</P>
<P>
Victor's Pappas' PAC staging happily manages to finesse the problem of cast 
inexperience with directorial clarity and several nicely shaped collegiate 
performances, despite a glaring weakness in the central role of Joe, wanly 
played by Phillip Beck (the lone professional actor and, ironically, the 
conservatory director). 
</P>
<P>
If Mark Ciglar gives the comedy's most extroverted and entertaining performance 
as Kit Carson, a Western old-timer with a con man's gift of gab and a skein of 
eccentric stories, Darin Heames gives the most authentic performance as Dudley, 
a bespectacled young man desperately trying to connect with the woman he loves 
on the saloon's public telephone. 
</P>
<P>
But the real test of the production's authenticity comes in the roles of Harry, 
the would-be hoofer-comedian who wants to break into show business, and Wesley, 
the starving drifter whose talent for noodling on the piano turns into gainful 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
As Harry, Pete Benson somehow creates the illusion that he can do a bit of soft 
shoe, though he doesn't really seem a dancer. But, much more than that, Benson 
captures the yearning innocence that one imagines Gene Kelly projecting as the 
original Harry in the Broadway production. In his climactic speech, which is 
one of the subtler peaks of the play, Benson achieves a wonderful, double-edged 
flush of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley, a totally self-effacing role that reflects a certain amount of racial 
stereotyping, has less importance as a character but is essential to the 
texture of the play just the same. Saroyan calls him "a colored boy" in his 
stage directions, and he is supposed to be portrayed by a black actor. Here he 
is played by David Fraioli, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice of casting someone with the right skin color who can't play 
the piano or someone with the wrong skin color who can, Pappas made the 
appropriate move. It would have been disconcerting to listen to canned music 
for the piano tunes that compose so much of the play's aural backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, James Rice gives a solid-as-rock portrayal of Nick. Sam Zeller 
brings a blushing energy to the boyish Tom. Betsy Ferguson has the right look 
as Kitty, though she needs more personal allure. 
</P>
<P>
Notable cameos include Barth L. Maher as the union intellectual McCarthy, Dan 
Cole as the sadistic vice cop Blick, Terra Shelman as an enthralled society 
lady and Jeff Hutcherson as a drunk who bounces off the furniture like a 
billiard ball. 
</P>
<P>
Mention must also be made of the attractive set, particularly the red-and-blue 
jukebox that plays and replays "The Missouri Waltz," and the "American Destiny" 
pinball machine, a flag-waving contraption that is played nonstop for the 
entire length of the show by Todd Terry as the silently obsessive pinball whiz 
Willie.

Soviet police fired machine-guns at three families in four cars that failed to 
stop at a road checkpoint returning from a trip to the West, the Communist 
Party daily Pravda said today. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old boy was injured and the cars were riddled with bullets in the 
nighttime incident near the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk. The families, 
driving foreign-made cars from Germany to Kazakhstan, said they ignored an 
order to stop because they mistook the police for roadside bandits.

A new policy at Stanford University gives homosexual and unmarried couples the 
same rights as legally married students, entitling "domestic partners" to 
housing and university services such as library and athletic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Robinson, the school's acting dean of student affairs, said the policy, 
announced Tuesday by the university Board of Trustees, will keep students from 
having to choose between Stanford and their love interest. 
</P>
<P>
"The change also affirms Stanford's policy of not discriminating against 
students on a variety of factors, including sexual orientation," Robinson said.

The port of Los Angeles, one of the nation's busiest, was reopened today after 
being closed down Wednesday night by a wildcat longshoreman's work stoppage 
that began when authorities tried to serve a warrant at a union hall, an 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the harbor at San Pedro and adjoining Long Beach Harbor were operating as 
usual this morning as day-shift workers reported for work, a longshoremen's 
union spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The wildcat action, initially involving as many as 300 people, appeared to have 
had little effect because few ships are unloaded at night. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 5:30 p.m. when two investigators from the district 
attorney's office went to a union hall in Wilmington to serve an arrest warrant 
on a man wanted for failing to pay child support.

GULF FLIGHTS GROUNDED IN WAKE OF U.S. CRASHES

The Air Force grounded all training flights in the Persian Gulf area for a 
24-hour period ending today in order to discuss with pilots the recent rash of 
U.S. aircraft accidents in Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon announced. 
</P>
<P>
The "flying stand-down" was declared Wednesday at noon Saudi time and lifted at 
noon today, Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The halt applied to all training flights but not to reconnaissance missions and 
other "operational patrols," said another spokesman, Col. Miguel Monteverde. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no degradation of our ability to defend ourselves," Monteverde said. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 700 Air Force combat and support aircraft in the gulf 
area as part of Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force declared a flying stand-down for one day to conduct safety 
awareness meetings with Air Force pilots," Williams said, "to get together with 
everybody and just sort of review what they need to do to fly more safely." 
</P>
<P>
The official death toll for Operation Desert Shield rose to 31 on Wednesday 
when an Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi 
Arabia, killing both crew members. On Monday, two pilots were killed in the 
crash of an Air Force F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet in Saudi Arabia, and just 
hours earlier two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters, each carrying four crew 
members, crashed over the Arabian Sea, killing all eight men. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Britain turned up the pressure on Iraq, saying the U.S.-led 
alliance in the Persian Gulf must decide within weeks whether sanctions -- or 
war -- will force President Saddam Hussein to pull out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the anti-Iraq coalition will have to assess 
whether the diplomatic isolation of Baghdad, economic sanctions and an oil 
blockade will drive Iraq from the emirate it seized Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Within a matter of weeks the alliance must "take stock whether these pressures 
are going to do the job or whether the military option will have to be 
prepared," he told British Broadcasting Corp. television. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain believes it is vital to keep pressure 
on Hussein and "leave him in no doubt that a military option exists."

FOSSIL OF OLDEST 'MODERN' BIRD FOUND IN CHINA

<P>
Scientists have pieced together what they believe is the oldest fossil of a 
"modern" bird, a sparrow-sized creature that flitted among the forests of China 
about 135 million years ago, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from three clawed fingers along its wings hinting at its dinosaur 
ancestry, the ancient bird likely looked and acted much like the songbirds that 
drop by suburban bird feeders, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw this bird perched in a tree it would probably appear modern, with 
flying and perching abilities virtually identical to today's birds," said Paul 
Sereno of the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Based on plant and animal life found surrounding the fossil, Sereno estimated 
that the bird dates back about 135 million years -- 10 million years older than 
the oldest previously known fossils of modern birds, which were found in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese bird, which has not been named, is still about 10 million 
years younger than the oldest known bird-like creature, called Archaeopteryx. 
The chicken-sized Arachaeopteryx is not considered a modern bird because its 
flying consisted mostly of gliding, it lacked grasping feet and its long tail 
probably kept it from taking off from the ground, Sereno said.

U.S. DECRIES TREATMENT OF EVACUEES;

GULF CRISIS: IT SAYS SOME OF THE 270 AMERICANS WHO FLEW HOME WEDNESDAY WERE

<P>
The State Department expressed outrage today over Iraqi intimidation and 
harassment of the latest planeload of evacuees from Iraq and Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that a chartered 747 left 
Basra, in southern Iraq, on Wednesday with about 320 people, about 270 American 
citizens and the rest foreign-born members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuees are now in London, recovering from what was described as a long 
ordeal without food and water, punctuated by constant interrogation and threats 
by Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuees, originally scheduled to arrive in the United States late this 
afternoon, will be flown to Raleigh-Durham (N.C.) Airport on Friday instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We are profoundly disturbed by several aspects of yesterday's evacuation," 
Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Iraqis did not allow a U.S. Embassy representative to accompany 
the evacuees from Kuwait to Basra. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Iraqis also reneged on their promise to provide a representative 
from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist the bus convoy from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Ten buses left Kuwait on Wednesday for what should have been a three-hour ride 
that turned into a 10-hour ordeal for the passengers, many of them infants. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said the buses, instead of taking the direct route to Basra, were 
redirected by the Iraqis to a hotel in Kuwait City, where the passengers were 
herded into rooms and interrogated for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of passengers, suspecting they were going to be permanently 
detained, left the buses and returned to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
When the buses were allowed to proceed, Iraqi soldiers again interrogated 
passengers at the border for another three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said there was no food or water available and that some of the 
passengers said they were threatened with weapons by the Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
At Basra, the Iraqi authorities challenged the documentation of seven of the 
evacuees and refused them permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that when the plane arrived in Baghdad, an ill American man, an 
American woman, her Jordanian husband and their two children were removed from 
the plane and were reportedly taken to a hotel.

The Soviet Union's most advanced booster, carrying what was believed to be a 
Soviet spy satellite, exploded seconds after liftoff last week, Tass news 
agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
The blast nearly destroyed the launch pad and may complicate Soviet efforts to 
sell space hardware to the West, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the booster "broke up" at the Baikonur spaceport in the Central Asian 
republic of Kazakhstan last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that no one was hurt and that a commission was investigating the 
accident. The three-sentence dispatch did not identify the payload or give any 
other details, including why the accident was not reported sooner.

The French chemical and pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc SA said today it 
will slash 3,500 jobs from its Brazilian work force due to government austerity 
measures that are crimping business activity there. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary layoffs are being conducted at the Sao Paolo-based Rhodia SA, which 
makes chemicals, fibers and medical products, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"People that leave simply won't be replaced," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 workers have already left since Brazilian President Fernando Collor 
de Mello instituted his anti-inflation austerity program last year. Another 
1,500 are expected to go over the next two years, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc's first-half profits were off 13% from a year ago, partly due to 
a $58.7-million loss at Rhodia. It was the first loss recorded by the Brazilian 
division, which had been a jewel in Rhone-Poulenc's crown during the 1980s.

West Palm Beach, Fla., is projected to experience America's fastest pace of 
economic growth to the year 2000 along with other metropolitan areas in the Sun 
Belt, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Also projected to lead the nation in growth of income, population and jobs, in 
order, are Phoenix; Orlando and Tampa, Fla., and Riverside-San Bernardino, San 
Diego and Sacramento. 
</P>

Angeles and Washington will have economic growth above the national average to 
the year 2000," the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 19 million new jobs are projected for the nation by the year 2000," the 
department said. "Los Angeles and Washington are projected to gain more than 
one-half million jobs each." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Oakland, Calif.; Ft. Lauderdale and Jacksonville, Fla., Atlanta and

Prosecutors today linked a second major Japanese bank, Tokyo-based Sanwa Bank, 
to a growing stock manipulation scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before the Tokyo District Court, prosecutors charged stock 
speculator Mitsuhiro Kotani and a longtime associate with conspiring to 
manipulate the share prices of a large resort development firm in April. 
</P>
<P>
They also alleged that Sanwa Bank provided Kotani and associates with $238.5 
million that was used to manipulate the share prices, according to a transcript 
of the prosecution's argument published in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the chairman of Sumitomo Bank, Ichiro Isoda, resigned after a 
manager at one of Sumitomo's branches was linked to Kotani's stock activities 
in the latest scandal to rock Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Kotani pleaded not guilty today to charges of manipulating the share prices of 
Fujita Tourist Enterprises, a major hotel developer listed on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The other suspect indicted in the case, Shuichi Yamamoto, 50, head of the small 
construction firm Joko Co., also entered a not-guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution told the court that Kotani, Yamamoto, officials of the 
construction firm Tobishima Corp. and Fujita Tourist had cooperated to drive up 
the price of Fujita shares in May, 1989.

Burger King Corp., America's No. 2 hamburger chain, is poised to trim up to 400 
people from its staff nationwide, including regional vice presidents and 
franchise operations managers, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald said 300 to 400 workers could be affected by the cuts, which 
would represent the second such round of layoffs since the fast-food giant was 
acquired by Grand Metropolitan PLC in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Burger King employs about 41,000 workers nationwide, including more than 1,000 
at its south Florida headquarters and in its regional offices. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Met cut Burger King's corporate staff by 550 employees in April, 1989, 
including about 100 workers at its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions left the company with a headquarters staff of about 450 and a 
field staff of about 580, Burger King said at the time.

Japanese baseball fans will get their chance to toast Cecil Fielder, the newest

approval. 
</P>

Steve Greenberg, deputy commissioner of baseball, announced in September that 
Fielder would be part of the all-star team sent to Japan for a string of eight 
exhibition games in November. But Tigers General Manager Bill Lajoie said the 
commissioner's office failed to get permission from the club to include 
Fielder. Lajoie has since given Fielder permission to play in the tour. 
</P>
<P>
A photograph of Fielder, idolized in Japan since his stint last year with the 
Hanshin Tigers, appears on the tour's program.

FRANCE SURPRISES U.S. IN DUNHILL CUP

Defending champion United States was eliminated 2 1/2- 1/2 in the first round 
of the Dunhill Cup by France today, adding another bitter souvenir of a 
European trip for American golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Also out was second-seeded Australia, with its top two players -- PGA Tour 
money leader Greg Norman and PGA champion Wayne Grady -- losing to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The unseeded French team of Marc Farry, Jean Van de Velde and Emmanuel Dussart 
led from the very first hole of the medal-match play series to beat U.S. 
golfing millionaires Mark Calcavecchia, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
Only a double-bogey 6 by Van de Velde on the 17th -- the notorious Road Hole -- 
enabled Strange to tie him for the lone American points. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight year that France started the team event with a major 
upset. France beat second-seeded Australia in the opening round a year ago. It 
also was the first time since the initial Dunhill Cup in 1985 that the United 
States had been a first-round loser. 
</P>
<P>
Farry, with a blue ski cap pulled tight against the cold, damp weather, beat 
Calcavecchia, the 1989 British Open champion, 70-73. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no luck involved. He just beat me," Calcavecchia said. "Their whole 
team played well, it looks like, and we didn't play at all." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Velde led two-time U.S. Open winner Strange by two strokes when he hit 
his second shot into a bunker at No. 17, then missed a 4-foot putt. He and 
Strange tied at 69-69. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying a thing," Strange snapped at reporters who tried to find out 
what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Dussart, whose third-place tie in this year's Tenerife Open was the best career 
showing for any of the French trio, then clinched the upset victory when he 
nailed a downhill 6-foot bogey putt on the 18th to seal a 73-74 victory over 
Kite, the leading money winner in golf history.. 
</P>
<P>
"I am elated," Dussart said. 
</P>
<P>
France plays eighth-seeded Japan in the second round. Last year's runners-up 
beat Argentina, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Norman lost to New Zealand's Frank Nobilo, a journeyman on the European tour, 
67-76. Norman collapsed on the back nine with three bogeys and a double-bogey 6 
at the Road Hole. 
</P>
<P>
Grady also had back-nine problems, including a quadruple-bogey 9 at No. 14 that 
turned a two-shot lead into a two-shot deficit. The PGA champ needed four shots 
to get out of a bunker there, then took a double-bogey 6 at the 16th to lose to 
Simon Owen, 74-78. 
</P>
<P>
Rodger Davis got the lone Australian win, 66-75 over Greg Turner.

<P>
The NBA champion will face top teams from other nations in a world club 
championship that could begin as early as 1993, NBA Commissioner David Stern 
and international officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which would be held during the NBA preseason, eventually could 
include up to 16 teams that have won national titles in Europe, South America, 
Australia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Stern and Boris Stankovic, head of FIBA, the international basketball 
association, said the tournament could grow out of the four-nation McDonald's 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in 1993 you will see the beginning of expansion of the McDonald's Open 
to where it would develop into the world championship of clubs," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
Details have not been worked out, but Stankovic said he hopes the event could 
begin in 1993 -- the year after NBA players become eligible to play in the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still discussing the date, but we will try to do everything possible to 
start that year," Stankovic said. "Before that is too early, and after that is 
too late." 
</P>
<P>
The club tournaments now involving 28 European nations could be used as 
qualifying events for the world club championships, he said, and similar 
qualifying tournaments could be held in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said the international role of the NBA will grow, with more preseason 
games, and possibly regular-season games, overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz will open this season with two games in Japan.

New England Patriots wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes, who suffered an eye injury 
in a brawl outside a nightclub, should be ready to play in the Patriots' next 
game, his doctor said today. 
</P>
<P>
The team was more cautious, saying it was too early to discuss Dykes' status. 
</P>
<P>
He was expected to be released from the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
"He is dramatically better than he was yesterday," ophthalmologist Robert Bahr 
said after examining Dykes at Rhode Island Hospital. "He's feeling better and 
he's seeing better." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes and teammate Irving Fryar were injured early Wednesday in an altercation 
outside Club Shalimar. Fryar, who pulled a handgun to stop the assault, said 
people were beating and kicking Dykes. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes' eye was swollen and he was kept overnight at the hospital for 
observation, Bahr said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to probably have to take it easy for a while," Bahr said, adding he 
expected Dykes to be able to play Oct. 18 against Miami. The Patriots have a 
bye this week.

Donald Trump's new book, "Surviving at the Top," has toppled from the New York 
Times' best-seller list after just seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Now its publisher, Random House, may be stuck with tens of thousands of unsold 
copies, the Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's first book, "The Art of the Deal" in 1987, stayed on the best-seller 
list for 48 weeks. Based on that success, Random House published and 
distributed nearly 500,000 copies of the new book and paid Trump an advance 
estimated at $2 million, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially brisk sales since publication two months ago propelled "Surviving at 
the Top" to the No. 1 spot for two weeks, but the book fell from the 
best-seller list released Wednesday, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is bombing heavily," said Carla Bayha, a purchaser for Book Inventory 
Systems, a company that buys books for 23 independent stores. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Vitale, Random House chief executive, said, "From the financial point 
of view, it has not been a disaster. And even if it does prove a mistake, 
that's publishing." 
</P>
<P>
Trump said he is delighted with the book's sales. "I think it's great," he 
said. He said Random House had told him it expects to sell as many as 250,000 
copies. The Times estimated sales so far at nearly 80,000 copies.

KLAN BARRED FROM PLAYING PHONE TAPES; 
</P>
<P>

The Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan must stop playing racist telephone 
recordings that imitate the "Mister Rogers" children's television show, a 
federal judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs on Wednesday also ordered the Klan and 
three of its alleged members to turn over tape recordings and other materials 
that lawyers for the program say infringe on its trademarks and copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
Sachs issued the temporary restraining order one day after Fred M. Rogers and 
his Family Communications Inc. sued to stop the Klan's use of the recording. 
The message imitates the sound effects and song of the "Mister Rogers" 
television show and Rogers' voice and speech patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"The messages are of racism, white supremacy and bigotry -- the antithesis of 
everything Rogers and Family Communications Inc. stand for," said Cynthia E. 
Kernick, a lawyer for Rogers from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
A group of civil rights, community and religious leaders complained last week 
that the number for a telephone in Independence that played the racist message 
had been circulated among elementary and middle school students in the 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
The same phone number was used earlier this year to promote the philosophy of 
the Missouri Knights of the Klan. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names the Klan and Adam Troy Mercer of Independence; Michael 
Brooks, also known as M. B. Madison, of Kansas City, and Edward E. Stephens, 
also of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Mercer, Madison and Stephens were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The judge set a hearing on a preliminary injunction for Oct. 20.

DILLER'S PET PROJECTS MAY RAISE EYEBROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Phyllis Diller is odd. 
</P>
<P>
After an impeccably served lunch of roast turkey with mashed potatoes and gravy 
on a screened-in patio overlooking the green acreage of her Brentwood estate, 
Diller asked her secretary Ingrid to fetch her pets. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid dutifully arrived carrying a clear plastic box about eight inches square 
with air holes the circumference of a wooden pencil. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully setting the box on the table, Ingrid stepped back. 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't they beautiful?" Diller asked, delighted by the arrival of her pets. 
</P>
<P>
Crawling around in the container were three of the ugliest creatures on this 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Their hard-shelled backs, multiple legs, lengthy feelers and sinister heads 
bespoke a mad scientist's genetic laboratory disaster. They were 
greenish-brown, almost four inches long and utterly repulsive. 
</P>
<P>
"They're Madagascar cockroaches!" Diller said. "I've named the little darlings 
Manny, Moe and Jack." 
</P>
<P>
The Madagascar cockroach is to the common American cockroach what King Kong is 
to a gibbon. 
</P>
<P>
Warned that if the creatures multiplied, Southern California could become an 
environmental wasteland, Diller said not to worry, "They're all males." 
</P>
<P>
After playing with the atrocities for a moment, Diller turned her attention to 
her business enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Although she continues to make millions from comedy appearances, resorts, TV 
guest shots and movies, she is one of the most successful businesswomen among 
Hollywood's performers. She runs seven separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
There are PhilDil Productions, Phyllis Diller Theatres Inc., Rockingham 
Productions, Diller Art Inc., Phyllis Diller Creations, Philli Dilli Chilli and 
La Vie Beauty Products. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm putting together deals for a chain of Phyllis Diller Theatres with 
attached restaurants," she said. "Not dinner theaters, because that is too 
distracting. We want to serve meals before and after performances. 
</P>
<P>
"The theaters would mount many new plays and most of the shows will involve 
comedy. The first theater will be in the Tampa (Fla.) area. I will have my own 
theaters where I can appear. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockingham Productions is for movies. Our first one is a Western, and I don't 
want to tell the title. 
</P>
<P>
"PhilDil is for producing my live comedy shows. Philli Dilli Chilli is my brand 
of chili and other food products for supermarkets. The art company is for the 
sale and distribution of my paintings and reproductions." 
</P>
<P>
Diller oversees her far-flung financial empire under the supervision of 
top-flight executives in each of the divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only called in for making important decisions," she said. "I'm good at 
making up my mind. I say a bad quick decision is better than a good slow 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Diller was interrupted by the raspy scrabbling of Manny, Moe and Jack in their 
confined quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"You may find this hard to believe," she said, "but you can really become 
attached to these things. Look, I think they recognize my voice. I really 
believe they like me."
