CHICANO STUDIES MAKES COMEBACK ON CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When he was a student at Santa Monica High School, Elias Serna's goal was to 
become an engineer and "make lots of money." 
</P>
<P>
There had never been much of it around the Serna household. "My mom is a single 
mother who raised us by herself," the young man explained. 
</P>
<P>
Since going to college, however, his goals have changed dramatically. Now his 
main interest is pursuing a career through which he can serve his community, 
possibly as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Serna, 20, attributes the change to his exposure -- for the first time -- to 
Latino teachers who have served as role models, and to the study of the history 
and literature of Mexican-Americans through the Chicano studies program at UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot about being Chicano and the importance of going back to 
your community to help," he said. And Serna said he is not alone, that despite 
the trend on college campuses emphasizing careers for personal advancement, 
most of his Chicano friends have also developed a strong commitment to their 
community through the lessons of Chicano studies. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of Serna and his friends for Chicano studies mirrors a rise in 
popularity of the programs, not only at UC Berkeley, but at universities across 
California and the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in Chicano studies programs has doubled on some campuses, and 
classes are drawing large numbers of non-Latino students for the first time. 
Beginning in 1991, UC Berkeley plans to require that all undergraduate students 
take an ethnic studies class, and other UC campuses are considering similar 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The growing demand for the classes, coupled with increasing public attention to 
the state's Latino population boom, has focused renewed interest on the field 
of Chicano studies. The state Legislature has called for an increase in hiring 
of Latino and other minority faculty members, calling their representation on 
public university campuses "dismal." 
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by these encouraging signs of change, Chicano professors are pushing 
for an expansion of existing programs and calling for a recommitment to the 
1960s ideals that spawned the Chicano studies programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research should address itself to the pressing problems of our community," 
said Tatcho Mindiola, director of the Mexican-American Studies Program at the 
University of Houston and a leader in the National Assn. for Chicano Studies. 
He added that the mission of Chicano studies remains "to challenge the status 
quo" and improve conditions in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Rodolfo Acuna, founder of the Chicano studies department at Cal State 
Northridge and honored by the association earlier this year as a model of 
academic excellence and community activism, credits Chicano studies with 
keeping the Chicano middle-class mindful of its responsibility to the broader 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the role of Chicano studies to that of black universities and 
churches in nurturing a community's collective conscience, Acuna said Chicano 
studies "has kept our history alive." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the university programs provide those who share a concern for 
Chicano community issues "a place where they can go and get support and where 
their ideas can ferment." 
</P>
<P>
A legacy of the 1960s Chicano protest movement, this activist tradition began 
when Chicanos barged their way into American academia and insisted on staying 
-- on their own terms. 
</P>
<P>
Their insistence on looking at the world through Chicano eyes has admittedly 
set some of the scholars apart from the Euro-centric mainstream of academic 
life that emphasizes academic "objectivity." But Chicano scholars argue that 
the so-called objectivity of previous Anglo scholars has often misrepresented, 
denigrated or ignored Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"We've institutionalized our courses and wrested control over what is said 
about us," Mindiola said. "It used to be all in the hands of Anglo scholars; 
now the majority of research on Chicanos is done by Chicanos." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the work of Chicano scholars has been in the social sciences, but 
increasingly there are contributions coming out of the humanities, in such 
fields as literary criticism and theory, according to some scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Others point to a blossoming of literary works and of research by Chicanas 
about women. The area of public policy research is another expanding field, 
with such work as UCLA Prof. David E. Hayes-Bautista's book, "The Burden of 
Support," which deals with the state's changing demographics and their economic 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicano studies resurgence of recent years followed a decade of 
retrenchment, marked by dwindling enrollment, budget cuts and denial of tenure. 
</P>
<P>
A Times telephone survey of a dozen universities in California shows that 
enrollments at most of the campuses fell to their lowest points during the late 
1970s and early 1980s, beginning their recovery only in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount University is typical in this regard. It had 229 students in 
the 1975-76 school year, but enrollment dropped to 91 by 1984-85. Last year, 
more students than ever, 288, took Chicano studies. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Northridge, 4,399 students were enrolled in Chicano studies last 
year, making it the nation's largest program in this subject. 
</P>
<P>
And while enrollment is clearly on the increase, other studies show that most 
campuses have only a handful of Chicano studies professors on staff. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report released earlier this year by a joint legislative 
committee calling for increased hiring of minority professors, while Latinos 
make up about 25% of the state's population, they are only about 3.4% of all 
tenured faculty in the University of California system. This is only a slight 
improvement over 10 years ago when the figure was 2.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The report challenged the universities to work harder to recruit more minority 
faculty, as well as students. It warned that the state "is threatened with a 
permanent underclass" unless higher education better serves minorities. 
</P>
<P>
UC President David Gardner has long advocated developing a faculty more 
reflective of the state's population, according to Rick Malaspina, a spokesman 
for Gardner. However, the number of available minority candidates has been 
limited, Malaspina said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chicano scholars are critical of what some call the intransigence of 
university officials in facing the realities of a changing society. 
</P>
<P>
"Universities should be the social conscience of society, the leaders. But 
they're not," said Adaljiza Sosa Riddell, director of the Chicano studies 
program at UC Davis. "To the extent that universities are moving on this issue, 
it is because they are being pushed by Chicanos."

 Humberto Luna is considered to be morning disc jockeys Rick Dees and Jay 
Thomas rolled into one. His new, $5-million, five-year contract -- the highest 
for a disc jockey in Spanish-language radio -- gives him a salary to match. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm well paid, but it makes me uncomfortable because I'm identified with the 
average person, the average Mexican," said Luna, 41, a native of Zacatecas. "I 
don't want to seem presumptuous, but I appreciate that they're recognizing my 
work after 20 years on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Luna's madcap antics during the 6 to 11 a.m. morning drive-time has brought 
KTNQ into the top 10 Los Angeles stations in the Arbitron ratings. "That's why 
we were so anxious to sign him," said KTNQ general manager Ken Wolt. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Ortega became a hero at San Gabriel High School when he wrested a 
semiautomatic rifle from a fellow student who was holding him and 69 other 
students hostage in a classroom last year. "I was afraid," Ortega said, "but I 
was just trying to get the gun away from him." Now, Ortega of Alhambra is also 
a hero to President Bush, who has awarded him a 1988 Young American Medal for 
Bravery. 
</P>
<P>
For singer Tony Melendez, life irrevocably changed "when the Pope jumped off 
the stage and we touched with a kiss. He kind of rubbed a little of his 
charisma off on me -- and maybe a little responsibility of the church." 
</P>
<P>
Born without arms, Melendez, 29, of Chino, plays guitar with his feet. Since 
John Paul II's kiss at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1987, Melendez has 
practiced a kind of ministry -- "singing my music and just trying to give 
people hope." 
</P>
<P>
His biography, "The Gift of Hope," will be published this year, and readers, he 
said, "will see this guy with no arms leading a very normal life." EDWARD J.

CALIFORNIA LEADS U.S. SPURT IN ELECTED LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California leads the nation in the percentage increase of Latino elected 
officials, the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Latinos won 580 elective offices in California -- an increase of 
20.8% over last year. A total of 3,783 Latinos hold elected offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that the increase -- primarily at the county, municipal and 
school board level -- will translate into a rise in political influence over 
the next decade for Latinos nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
For the sixth year, women made substantial gains; Latinas now comprise 19.7% of 
Latino officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
But while the association's figures show increased political activity, Latinos 
account for less than 1% of all elected officials.

AT 5 FEET 1, 97 LBS., LATINA GYMNAST, 13, SETS SIGHTS ON OLYMPICS TRYOUTS, 
CAREER

<P>
She is only 5 feet 1 and weighs a mere 97 pounds, but gymnast Denise Fierro has 
some big ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to get a college scholarship to study to become an orthodontist 
and I would like to compete in the Olympics," Denise said recently at her home 
in Covina, where she lives with her parents and younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old eighth-grader at Royal Oak Junior High School will have to wait 
awhile to join a sorority, but a potential Olympic appearance could be as close 
as the 1992 summer games in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Denise is one of the rising stars in American gymnastics. She won a gold medal 
in July as a member of the winning team at the U.S. Olympic Festival in 
Oklahoma City and made the 16-girl junior national squad by finishing 11th 
overall in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Her goal is to be one of the top three in the division by next year and then 
jump to the senior national team. To make that happen, Denise trains nearly 30 
hours a week -- including as long as eight hours a day during the summer -- 
something that is not exactly inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fierro, a manager at a luggage-manufacturing company, said it can cost 
up to $20,000 a year to develop the talents of gymnasts such as his daughter. 
Some of the travel and boarding expenses are paid by a booster club and a 
private fund set up for Denise, while others are covered by the U.S. Gymnastics 
Federation when it sanctions an event. The rest is picked up by Fierro and wife 
Bobbie, who works a part-time job to help with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
And the outlay of cash notwithstanding, all those heavy doses of tumbling 
passes and twisting vaults in the gym can have other side effects, too. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't even have a social life with us, let alone with friends," said 
Bobbie Fierro, who splits long hours driving Denise to the gym and 10-year-old 
Christine, a black belt in tae kwon do karate, to little league baseball 
practices or games. 
</P>
<P>
"We go out to dinner on Fridays and she never goes," she said in reference to 
Denise, who often trains into the night on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not to say Denise avoids food. Before a recent late-afternoon 
training session at the Charter Oak Gymnastics Center, she consumed a hearty 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, clad in a black-striped pink leotard that accentuated her 
Nadia Comaneci-like physique, Denise was spinning on the uneven parallel bars 
and landing back aerials on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
No judges were around, but Denise was putting on a good show for a photographer 
snapping her picture. 
</P>
<P>
"She has audience appeal; she plays to the crowd," said Beth Rybacki, who with 
her husband, Steve, coaches Denise and who in 1980 made the U.S. Olympic team 
that never got to Moscow because of the American boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"She is coming up very fast. All you have to do is tell her things once and 
she's got it. And she has no fear factor. That just doesn't come along every 
day," added Rybacki. 
</P>
<P>
That carefree attitude is evident when Denise talks about some of her favorite 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
"One is a vault catch and release on the uneven bars, and another is a 
round-off entry vault with a tucked full twist," said Denise with a smile that 
uncovered a set of dental braces. 
</P>
<P>
And although the routines can often be dangerous, and the personal sacrifices 
significant, Denise wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's (gymnastics) going to get me where I want to be," she explained. "All 
I've done until now was to make the national team and it paid off, so I'm 
happy."

ARNOLD M. PICKER; FILM INDUSTRY FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arnold M. Picker, former executive vice president of United Artists Pictures 
and a nationally prominent political fund-raiser for Democrats, has died at the 
age of 76. 
</P>
<P>
He died Sunday of pneumonia at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
As finance chairman for former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie's 1972 
presidential campaign, Picker became something of a political power broker. In 
1980, he was considered the driving force behind Democrats for an Open 
Convention, a group of businessmen and officials who tried to prevent the 
nomination of either incumbent President Jimmy Carter or Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of his work with Muskie, Picker was targeted by a 1971 plan of the 
Nixon White House to use Internal Revenue Service audits in what a memo called 
an effort "to screw our political enemies." According to secret memos given to 
the Senate Watergate Committee by John W. Dean III, counsel to President 
Richard M. Nixon, Picker was the No. 1 target on a priority list of 20 supposed 
"enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Picker gained respect in the film industry for his efforts to foster the medium 
as art. He helped form the American Film Institute and was a co-founder of the 
Holocaust Documentation &amp; Education Center at Florida International 
University in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
He also served as chairman of the board of the National Center for Jewish Film 
set up by the American Jewish Historical Society at Brandeis University in 
Waltham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Loews Theater executive David V. Picker, he began his career with 
Columbia Pictures in 1935 in its foreign department. Ten years later, he was 
named vice president in charge of foreign distribution for Columbia Pictures 
International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Picker switched to United Artists Pictures in 1951 as a partner and executive 
vice president in charge of international distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"No executive to my knowledge was more respected and admired by those who were 
privileged to work with him," Arthur B. Krim, former chairman of United Artists 
Corp. and now chairman of the board of Orion Pictures, told Daily Variety after 
Picker's death. 
</P>
<P>
President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Picker to the U.S. Advisory Commission on 
International Education and Cultural Affairs in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Picker is survived by his wife, two daughters, two brothers, and seven 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Private services were conducted Wednesday in New York.

COAST PANEL APPROVES ARTIFICIAL REEF; 
</P>
<P>
PROJECT SEEN AS COMPLEMENT TO BATIQUITOS LAGOON RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The California Coastal Commission on Wednesday approved plans for a 10,000-ton 
artificial reef near Carlsbad, and state officials said they expect to begin 
construction later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The quarry rock reef, to be located about half a mile offshore near the mouth 
of Batiquitos Lagoon, will be the sixth artificial underwater habitat built by 
the California Department of Fish and Game since 1980. State marine biologists 
believe this reef, like others near Oceanside and Santa Monica, will attract 
fish and eventually increase fish populations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're learning to build the ultimate reef," John J. Grant, a marine biologist 
with the state's Nearshore Sportfish Habitat Enhancement Program, told the 
commissioners at their monthly meeting in San Diego. With the commission's 
support, Grant said, he expects no further obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad politicians, eager to help spur the local sportfishing industry, said 
they were thrilled that the long-awaited reef will soon be under way. Funded 
with about $300,000 from a special tax on fishing equipment and fuel used by 
sportfishing boats, the reef is designed to complement a proposed $20-million 
lagoon restoration that could be completed by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so pleased," Carlsbad Mayor Pro-Tem Ann Kulchin said. "We see this as 
an opportunity to lure the fishes and keep them here." And she sees it as an 
inexpensive recreation that requires only a fishing pole and a boat. 
</P>
<P>
State scientists found that the reef will have no negative effect on the 
environment. In fact, Grant said, the reef will increase the "survivability" of 
some fish by making them less vulnerable to predators. 
</P>
<P>
But some environmentalists see the reef as linked to the larger lagoon 
restoration, a project they fear will disrupt some endangered birds that now 
live there. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Jackson, coastal chairwoman of the San Diego chapter of the Sierra Club, 
said she is particularly worried about the California least tern, a small white 
bird that is one of several endangered birds that call the wetlands home. 
</P>
<P>
"That reef is one little stop on the way to disaster," she said.

Jackson's objection stems from the fact that the restoration is a so-called 
mitigation project, intended to compensate for the destruction of marine 
habitat elsewhere in the state. In this case, she says, Batiquitos Lagoon is 
being disrupted to aid the Port of Los Angeles, which is financing the lagoon 
restoration in order to offset damage that occurred when it built a landfill in 
San Pedro Bay. Such reparations are required under the Endangered Species Act, 
but Jackson said she thinks the act is being misapplied. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it was the intention of the Endangered Species Act to sanction 
the destruction of habitat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Grant acknowledged that the reef site was chosen in part because of the planned 
restoration. But, he said, the reef has "nothing to do" with the Port of Los 
Angeles. Although he has no role in the restoration, Grant said he believes it 
would have a positive effect on the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The bay is already artificial and man-made. All the restoration will do is 
return it to the way it was before we started messing it up," he said. "Man 
leaves such big footprints wherever we go, it's nice to be able to fill one 
back in. And I believe that's what we'll be doing with this reef."

SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISTS MAY BE THE TRAPS, FBI WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As city officials open their arms to the largest number of Soviet tourists ever 
to visit San Diego, FBI officials are shaking their heads and urging caution. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual public appeal, the bureau is warning San Diegans that their 
contacts with visiting Russians may be used by "skilled intelligence officers" 
for espionage. 
</P>
<P>
"Every San Diego citizen should be a good host to visitors but should also be 
alert. If activity is observed which appears to be outside the normal tourist 
activity, the FBI should be contacted," according to an FBI statement prepared 
for a news conference this morning. 
</P>
<P>
During the next two weeks alone, more than 300 Russians will arrive for San 
Diego's Soviet arts festival, which begins Oct. 21. City officials say they are 
making every effort to welcome the visitors, but the FBI warns that spies could 
easily prowl the city, using the festival hoopla to veil their activities and 
dupe unwitting citizens into revealing more than they ought. FBI officials 
point to 13 proven cases of espionage in the past three years that have 
blemished the nation's security. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987, the U. S. State Department granted 12,000 Soviet tourist visas 
nationwide. In 1988, the number jumped to 27,500, and this year officials 
estimate that the number will increase to more than 60,000 visas. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in visitors coming to San Diego is proportionately similar," the 
FBI statement says. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials declined to comment on the statement, saying they will discuss it 
in greater detail at today's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"This increased contact between San Diego residents and Soviet citizens is both 
good and bad," the statement says. "There is, however, the possibility that 
these contacts will be used by skilled intelligence officers for other 
purposes. Experience shows such has occurred in the past, and wisdom suggests 
it will happen in the future." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say residents have responded to the Soviet visitors with 
hospitality. Some have offered their homes; others said they would cook 
dinners. More than 100,000 tickets to the festival have already been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, the leading proponent of the festival, could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday. Her spokesman, Paul Downey, said: "We really 
don't see any problems at all; we are doing this with the total blessing of the 
U.S. government. From our standpoint, everybody who is coming from the Soviet 
Union is connected with the arts. I think everybody coming is who they say they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Local military officials declined to discuss whether they will increase 
security, as the FBI is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The military is not going to change its posture," said Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a 
Navy spokesman. "If the Soviet Union wanted to get someone to San Diego, it's 
not impossible, and they don't need a festival to do it." 
</P>
<P>
As the warmth of glasnost trickles down to the military, officials are sending 
mixed signals. Although they now welcome top-ranking Soviet officials -- 
including the Soviet defense minister -- to visit local military bases, they 
are admonished not to be overly friendly. Since 1988, all Navy personnel have 
been required to report "any form of contact, intentional or unintentional" 
with anyone from a list of designated countries, which includes the Soviet 
Union, China, Cambodia, Iran, Romania and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Agents at the Naval Investigative Services in Washington have warned officers 
to watch for unusual signs among personnel such as "unexplained affluence, 
exotic vacations, things out of the ordinary like working late and excessive 
amounts of time spent copying things," according to the Navy Times. 
</P>
<P>
The NIS recently set up a nationwide espionage hot line for Navy personnel to 
call if they suspect espionage. (The number is 1-800-543-NAVY.) And, to raise 
sensitivity to the spy-threat, it has issued a 36-page booklet titled 
"Espionage." The booklet's cover consists of photographs of Navy personnel who 
were convicted on espionage charges from 1962 to 1989.

HIGH COURT BARS D.A. FROM MURDER RETRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court on Wednesday barred San Diego County prosecutors 
from the retrial of a San Diego insurance executive accused of murder, by 
declining to review a ruling that Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller had lost his 
"perspective" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action left standing a decision issued in June by the 4th 
District Court of Appeal in San Diego, upholding San Diego Superior Court Judge 
J. Perry Langford's order that the California attorney general prosecute the 
retrial of Herman Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Langford said in his order that Miller had "lost his perspective" in the case, 
and the appellate court upheld that view when it ruled 2 to 1 that Martin could 
not get a fair trial from Miller's office. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was charged with arranging the 1981 killing of La Jolla attorney Richard 
Crake. He was convicted in March, 1982. But Martin won a new trial in November, 
1987, when the state Supreme Court found "serious misconduct" by San Diego 
County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
That 1987 decision, in turn, upheld the findings of a special referee, 
appointed by the high court to investigate the case. Retired appellate Justice 
Gerald A. Brown concluded in a 1986 report that misconduct by a prosecutor in 
Miller's office and perjury by the prosecutor's key witness resulted in 
Martin's wrongful conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's findings had so angered Miller that he issued press releases and made 
strong public statements criticizing the report. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said in a 1986 interview that Brown's analysis of the case had been a 
"rather naive, gullible approach." Shortly after the 1987 Supreme Court ruling, 
Miller called Brown's report "just bunk." 
</P>
<P>
Martin's attorney, Charles M. Sevilla, then charged that Miller was so biased 
against Martin that Martin could not receive a fair trial if the San Diego 
district attorney's office were involved. Sevilla said Miller was trying to 
"vindicate" the honor of his office by proving Brown wrong and winning Martin's 
conviction a second time. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District court agreed, saying that the "district attorney's involvement 
in the Martin case has moved from "purely impartial 'professional' concerns to 
undue 'personal' concerns based on a desire to prove the referee's findings 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court's action Wednesday was made without comment. Miller 
could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla was out of the country on vacation, but his partner, John Cleary, said 
that Sevilla "kind of expected" the state Supreme Court's action because of the 
nature of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the manner in which it was resolved by the Court of Appeal and given the 
press of business at the California Supreme Court, there was not a great deal 
of serious consideration that it would rise to the level of cases the Supreme 
Court considers," Cleary said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin remains free on bail, Cleary said.

CENTINELA VALLEY SCHOOLS TRY HIGHLY TOUTED STUDENT JOBS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Centinela Valley Union High School District, as part of a pilot program in 
California, this semester began a new work-training and job-placement program 
that has cut youth unemployment by 40% in schools in other states. 
</P>
<P>
The program, unveiled in a special presentation to parents Wednesday night, is 
intended to consolidate the district's fragmented vocational, work-experience 
and job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The district so far has enrolled 475 junior and seniors from Leuzinger and 
Hawthorne high schools, school officials said, targeting all high school 
students who are most likely to drop out. It is specifically aimed at seniors 
with a grade-point average below C- and poor attendance, Supt. McKinley Nash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Created by Jobs for America's Graduates Inc. -- a Washington-based, nonprofit 
corporation funded by foundations and corporate donations -- the program was 
first implemented statewide in Delaware in 1979. It has been copied in 280 
schools in 14 states. In California, it is being offered this fall in the 
Centinela district and Merced County. 
</P>
<P>
Four job specialists were placed in each high school in Centinela to identify 
students for the program, assist them in enrolling in vocational and technical 
courses, help them obtain entry-level jobs, and monitor their job performance 
for up to nine months after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
The job specialists meet with students for at least 60 hours throughout the 
year, teaching them basic employment skills such as succeeding in an interview, 
expressing leadership skills, dressing properly, writing resumes and having 
good work habits. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators praised the program as a weapon against delinquency and 
dropouts in their remarks during Tuesday's school board meeting. The district, 
which covers Lawndale and Hawthorne, has 5,200 students in its two main high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
In districts where the program has operated, there has been a 40% reduction in 
youth unemployment, a 100% increase in minority student employment and a 20% 
increase in earnings for youths, according to a school district report. 
</P>
<P>
"It is designed to reduce dropouts (and) train youngsters with a certain number 
of skills," said Nash. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted with this," said school board President Aleta Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has earmarked $400,000 for start-up costs, with $300,000 
coming from the State Department of Education and $130,000 from the South Bay 
Private Industry Council, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
District representatives are seeking state and federal grants to reimburse the 
schools for the cost of the program. After the first year, the program is 
expected to cost about $200,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The need for the program outweighs the cost, Nash said, because the district's 
two high schools have a 25% dropout rate over four years. It is average for the 
state, according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
The district sought the program after Nash heard about it in June at a 
conference in Baltimore. At the same time, officials of Jobs for America's 
Graduates were separately seeking to get the State Department of Education to 
offer the program. 
</P>
<P>
Students volunteer for the program and earn credits toward graduation for the 
vocational and technical training courses. They are bused to the South Coast 
Regional Occupational Center in Torrance for vocational classes and go to El 
Camino College to attend technical courses such as computer programming and 
electronics repair, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Wakiaa Fisher, a 17-year-old senior at Leuzinger, said she joined the program 
to get training and counseling to help her find a high-paying job after 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . .You don't want to work at McDonald's all your life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Watkins, also a senior at Leuzinger, said he thinks the program will 
encourage students to finish school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy for someone to drop out and quit. My brother did," he said, 
adding that the skills and counseling provided by the program "give you 
reassurance." 
</P>
<P>
Cristina Tapia, 16, agreed, adding that students at Leuzinger are very 
supportive of the program, which she said has been the topic of much campus 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Smith, president of Jobs for America's Graduates Inc., said the program has 
had an 85% success rate in placing students in jobs and keeping them employed. 
He said that if the program succeeds in Centinela and Merced, it will stand as 
an example for districts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will be watching this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he is in the process of appointing a board of directors composed of 
13 corporate vice presidents from businesses in the South Bay to oversee the 
program and recommend policy changes to the school board.

CLEANUP AT ASBESTOS-TAINTED SITE TO START; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: A FORMER MANUFACTURING PLANT IN CARSON WILL BURY CONTAMINATED SOIL 
AT THE SITE WHERE THE SOIL WAS FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleanup is scheduled to start today on a former Carson manufacturing site 
contaminated with asbestos, which can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cubic yards of contaminated soil will be buried at the 65-acre 
site, where Manville Corp. operated a pipe manufacturing plant from 1937 to 
1982. The soil will be buried in two dumps on the west side of the site, at 
2420 E. 223rd St. 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Health Services, this is the first time 
that a South Bay company has been allowed to permanently bury toxic waste on 
the same site at which it was found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's less costly and a lot safer," said Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for the 
state Health Services Toxic Substances Control Division. "You want to try to 
move the asbestos as little as possible." 
</P>
<P>
When inhaled, asbestos fibers have been shown to cause lung cancer and 
respiratory ailments, Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
The site is across the Dominguez Flood Control Channel from the Arco Oil 
Refinery and borders the Ventura Transfer Co. The nearest residential area, 
Lincoln Village, is three-fourths of a mile away. Hirsch said residents will 
not be at risk during the project because the soil will be sprinkled with water 
to keep the asbestos fibers from entering the air. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the site posed a health risk to residents in the past is uncertain, 
said Bill Kelly, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. "Obviously," Kelly said, "it is possible the asbestos migrated from 
the wind off the site." 
</P>
<P>
During the four-month project, workers will move about 70,000 cubic yards of 
soil -- enough to fill 28 Olympic-size swimming pools -- to two heavily 
contaminated areas of the site, said Dave Samson, a spokesman for Denver-based 
Manville Corp. These two disposal areas, at the western edge of the property, 
already contain about 325,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil. 
</P>
<P>
According to state documents, soil studies have found that in some areas, 
including the disposal sites, asbestos concentrations ranged from 40% to 90%. 
Concentrations in most areas were less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Water Quality Control Board found that asbestos had not 
contaminated the ground water, Hirsch said. It also found no evidence that, 
once buried, the asbestos would migrate through the ground to other areas, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
State agencies will continue to monitor the site's two disposal areas once the 
project is done, Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dumps, a 7 1/2-acre disposal area at the northwest edge of the 
property, will be covered with a foot of fresh soil and a layer of sod. A 6 
1/2-acre waste dump at the southwest corner will be covered by a foot of soil 
topped by asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch said deed restrictions will prohibit anyone from developing the areas or 
digging into them without state approval. Nevertheless, Trammell Crow Co., a 
developer of business and industrial parks, has agreed to purchase the property 
provided the cleanup is a success, Samson said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Rakowich, a partner in Trammell Crow's South Bay office in Carson, said 
the firm plans to build a business park at the site. Samson and Rakowich 
declined to reveal the sales price. 
</P>
<P>
Although Manville will retain ownership and maintenance responsibilities of 
both disposal areas, it will lease the asphalt lot to Trammell Crow, which 
plans to use it to store trucks and vehicles, Samson said. 
</P>
<P>
Manville, formerly the Johns-Manville Corp., manufactured asbestos-lined cement 
pipes and insulation at the site from 1937 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
When Manville began dismantling the site in 1983, it informed the Department of 
Health Services that asbestos was present on the property, Hirsch said. Over 
the years, asbestos had been dumped in waste piles, pits and settling ponds on 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the state asked Manville to begin an investigation into the extent of 
the soil contamination. Manville submitted a work plan for the investigation in 
1985, and the department approved the results of the investigation in November, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, the South Coast Air Quality Management District had cited 
Manville for violating a regulation that requires sprinkling or coating of 
areas where dust can be released into the air, Kelly said. Manville pleaded no 
contest and was fined $1,026, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the citation, Manville installed a water sprinkling system to keep the 
fibers from freely floating in the air, Samson said. 
</P>
<P>
Manville started a feasibility study in 1987 on its options: among them, moving 
the asbestos off the property, perhaps out of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"That was by far the most expensive (solution)," Samson said. "That also posed 
the greatest risk." 
</P>
<P>
Moving the asbestos off the site would have cost $119 million, according to an 
engineering study included in the cleanup plan. That would also have risked 
asbestos spreading through the air during transport, Samson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hauling all the asbestos off probably poses the greatest danger," said David 
Reizer, an assistant planner for the city of Carson. "You're talking about 
hauling stuff out and hauling stuff in, not to mention the traffic side. It 
would be a very monumental project." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Long Beach-based Earth Technology Corp., a firm that specializes in 
planning hazardous-waste cleanups, came up with the plan to keep the asbestos 
on the site yet salvage most of the property. The Department of Health Services 
approved that plan in May. 
</P>
<P>
Manville will spend about $3 million on the cleanup, including the cost of 
maintaining the area, Samson said. It also includes the cost of studies 
performed by Earth Technology for Manville over the last five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manville has done a similar project in Toronto, and is using on-site burial in 
cleaning up one of its sites in Manville, N.J., Samson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a new experimental technique," Hirsch said. "It's been done 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
During the project, workers will wear respirators and protective suits while 
they move the soil, Samson said. They also will continue to water down the soil 
to prevent it from blowing to nearby industrial plants during the move, Samson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND

can raise the risk of lung cancer. Recent studies suggest that drinking 
asbestos-contaminated water can increase the risk of gastrointestinal and 
pancreatic cancers.

LIVE, FROM ROLLING HILLS ESTATES, IT'S CITY COUNCIL NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was "show time" for the first time Tuesday in the Rolling Hills Estates City 
Council Chambers as the council made its debut on Dimension Cable Service, 
Channel 3. With two cameras set up and technicians checking monitors at the 
back of the chambers, Mayor Nell Mirels told the audience: "We're live on TV -- 
for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Before the cameras were turned on, council members got a few pointers from 
Dorothy Ciffone, Dimension's public access studio coordinator, on how to look, 
act and sound before the electronic eye. 
</P>
<P>
Out are white clothing and busy patterns that reflect too much light or jump 
around on the TV screen. In are solid colors, ranging from the darker hues to 
light peach. Jewelry, too, is fine. 
</P>
<P>
Sound, Ciffone cautioned, is a major concern. "Talk a proper distance from the 
microphone, not too far forward or too far back," she said. And don't "shuffle 
papers or drag maps over the microphones." That makes a terrific racket. 
</P>
<P>
And, she said, beware the open microphone: "You're on live and whatever you say 
will be picked up." This prompted Mirels to say that the council had better 
watch its "editorial comments." 
</P>
<P>
Council chambers have been brightened up for the cameras. There is new 
light-blue carpeting, and a darker blue wall-covering behind the council dais 
comes complete with a new wooden logo with the city's name and its pepper tree 
symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates council meetings -- held the second and fourth Tuesday at 
7:30 p.m. -- will be telecast live, with repeat showings the following Thursday 
at 7:30 p.m. Dimension already telecasts meetings of the Rancho Palos Verdes 
City Council, Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District board and the 
board of the Palos Verdes Library District. 
</P>
<P>
The debut telecast had a potential audience of 22,360 homes -- the total number 
of Dimension subscribers on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and in a portion of San 
Pedro. But only a handful -- 878 -- are in Rolling Hills Estates, where 
installation of the cable system has yet to be completed. Some 1,800 homes are 
able to receive service and new hookups are being made on a daily basis, 
according to the company. 
</P>

EX-U.S. ATTY. NUNEZ IS EXPECTED TO GET A TOP U.S. TREASURY POST

Peter K. Nunez, former U.S. attorney in San Diego, is expected to receive an 
appointment as an assistant secretary for enforcement in the Treasury 
Department, Bush Administration officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Nunez, contacted at his private law office in San Diego, said he has 
received no official word from the White House about the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably shouldn't comment, since nobody's called to tell me anything," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Bush Administration officials, Nunez has been recommended 
personally for the job by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The nomination 
is subject to confirmation by the Senate, and, if approved, Nunez would replace 
Salvatore R. Martouche, a Reagan Administration appointee. 
</P>
<P>
The post is a third-tier management position within the Treasury Department, 
and Nunez would be responsible for such agencies as the Secret Service and the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime Republican activist, Nunez was U. S. attorney in San Diego from 1982 
through mid-1988, and served as an assistant U. S. attorney for three years 
before that. Officials said he has extensive experience in the enforcement of 
drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration also said that another Californian, Carol Boyd Hallett, 
is being appointed as U. S. commissioner of customs. 
</P>
<P>
Hallett, former California state assemblywoman from Atascadero and ambassador 
to the Bahamas, would succeed William von Raab, who resigned earlier this year 
after differences with Brady and the Treasury's senior staff. Her appointment 
is made by Brady and does not require nomination by the President. She is 
expected to begin within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Hallett was a member of the California Assembly from 1976 to 1982, and was 
Republican leader from 1979 to 1982, leaving to become state director of parks 
and recreation in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
From 1984 through 1985, she served as assistant to the secretary of the 
interior for Western regional operations. Reagan appointed her ambassador to 
the Bahamas in 1986.

BUILDERS SHOULD INSTALL SOUND WALLS, L.A. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of fielding complaints about traffic noise from neighbors of the 
Hollywood Freeway, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday asked the Planning 
Department to require future developers of property beside any freeway to 
install walls or landscaping to buffer sound. 
</P>
<P>
But because the action applies only to new homes built next to freeways, it 
will not help those who have fought hardest for city assistance: residents of 
30 homes on the west side of Babcock Avenue in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't ignore us anymore," said Bob Brice, who lives in one of the 
houses. "The name 'city planning' implies that somebody sat down and thought 
about what they were doing when they built 30 homes next to the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Transportation experts concede that the freeway din on 
Babcock Avenue exceeds allowable levels. But because the homes were built after 
the freeway's 1968 completion, the area is not eligible for state-funded sound 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a semitrailer truck carrying hazardous waste careened off 
the freeway and into two of the houses, severely damaging them. Since then 
Caltrans has installed a freeway guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores agreed with the North Hollywood residents during 
Wednesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the city's responsibility, if we give the permission to build 
homes where we know there are going to be problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a concession to residents of Babcock Avenue and other existing 
neighborhoods, Councilman Joel Wachs asked the Planning Department to look into 
"creative solutions" for funding the sound walls. In the past, the department 
has maintained that the only option is for residents to pay for the walls 
themselves, by forming an assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
r Wachs also asked the city attorney's office to determine whether noise levels 
at homes on the east side of Babcock Avenue, which predate the freeway, also 
would exceed allowable levels if it were not for the sound buffer provided by 
the newer homes on the west side of the street. If that is the case, he said, 
then perhaps the city can argue with Caltrans that the newer homes deserve a 
state-funded sound wall, because their construction saved the state from having 
to build a wall to shield the homes across the street. 
</P>
<P>
During earlier committee meetings on the subject, council members expressed 
concern that the cost of requiring walls in new freeway-adjacent communities 
would be passed on to home buyers in the form of higher prices. At the Planning 
and Land Use Management Committee level, Councilman Hal Bernson suggested that 
the Planning Department be allowed to review the need for the walls on a 
case-by-case basis.

DENIAL OF MOST SANTA CLARITA VALLEY HOUSING TRACTS PREDICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jo Anne Darcy, a Santa Clarita city councilwoman and aide to Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, says the county will reject "more than half" of 43 
proposals to build 38,000 houses, apartments and condominiums in the 
unincorporated areas of the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy made the remark late Tuesday while the Santa Clarita City Council 
discussed how the developments might affect the young city. Council members 
have expressed concern that such development would eventually overburden the 
city's infrastructure, particularly roads. 
</P>
<P>
The 43 proposals all require amendments to the valley's general plan, which 
guides development in the area. The county is updating the general plan and 
will hold the first hearings on it in January. 
</P>
<P>
If the 43 are allowed under the new plan, developers would be able to build 
38,000 units on land zoned for 7,000 dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Council members expressed shock Tuesday after a consultant, hired to analyze 
the proposed projects, explained the potential growth outside the city 
boundaries. Alan Fishman of Tierra Planning &amp; Design said most of the 
projects would overburden public services and provide few benefits to the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon asked how such growth could be allowed. "How 
do you provide police and fire protection to all those areas?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Darcy, apparently trying to calm her colleagues, said the county would 
deny more than just a "small percentage" of the developments. "They'll cut it 
more than half," she said of the list of proposed projects. Darcy did not say 
which projects might be affected. 
</P>
<P>
However, Darcy later said that she did not know how the county's Regional 
Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors will assess the projects in the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
County policy allows up to 270,000 residents in the Santa Clarita Valley by the 
year 2010. County Planning Director James E. Hartl has said the county will 
have to reject some of the 43 projects to stay under that ceiling of 270,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
But the county also has the authority to raise that ceiling, and Hartl and 
other planning officials have declined to say definitively whether the county 
will keep the ceiling or whether it will scale down or reject the proposed 
developments. The population ceiling will be addressed when the county revises 
the valley's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the valley's population vary, but it hovers around 130,000, 
according to county and Santa Clarita officials. The 43 projects would add 
another 114,000 residents to the valley, Fishman said. 
</P>
<P>
The projects represent only a portion of the potential growth in the valley, 
Fishman said. The county has already approved more than 13,000 housing units 
that have yet to be built. Those developments would bring about 41,000 
residents into the valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fishman said the City Council should not endorse any of the 43 projects until 
their potential impact on roads and the environment is studied in greater 
detail.

NORIEGA CRONY JAILED IN PROBE OF STEROID LAB

<P>
A man who said he was a business associate of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel 
Antonio Noriega was charged with tax fraud Wednesday for running a Tijuana 
laboratory that allegedly produced millions of dollars worth of illegal 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is believed to be the main owner of Laboratorios Milano and could be 
prosecuted in the United States on charges related to the production of the 
illegal body-building drugs, a U. S. prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Javier Macklis, president and general manager of the laboratory, was held 
at a Mexico City prison after his arrest by Mexican police Monday at the Mexico 
City airport, officials at the attorney general's office told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
Macklis, 52, was charged with evading more than $600,000 in taxes and may face 
additional charges in connection with the laboratory, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Macklis told authorities he met the Panamanian military chief two years ago and 
said Noriega's profits from the steroid lab totaled $5 million, press reports 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
His arrest followed an extended investigation by Mexican authorities and 
several other arrests, including that of Macklis' son, during a raid on the 
laboratory in April. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. court documents, a wide range of steroids were manufactured 
at the laboratory, and phony labels were pasted on the bottles to make them 
appear to be the product of legitimate U.S. and European manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The steroids were then smuggled into the United States for sale and reportedly 
reaped millions of dollars in illegal profits. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega invested $800,000 in the company in 1988, Macklis was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who survived a bloody coup in Panama City Oct. 3, is already wanted in 
the United States on drug-trafficking charges.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISTRIAL DECLARED IN SLAYING OF 2 IN DESERT NEAR 
PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of a Palmdale man originally charged with executing two men in the 
Mojave Desert ended in a mistrial Wednesday after jurors said they could not 
agree on a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Howard Schwab ordered a new trial for Brad 
Millward, 30, on charges that he killed Bruce Gruber, 28, of Yucca Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Millward was initially charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the 
July 5, 1987, slayings of Gruber and Albert Dulyea, 37, of Norwalk. Last week, 
however, jurors acquitted him of Dulyea's death. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Joyce Tisher said the jury split six to six on whether to convict 
Millward of first-degree murder for Gruber's death. She said testimony from 
ballistics experts convinced most jurors that Millward shot Gruber, but some 
believed he fired in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were not given the opportunity to convict Millward of a lesser charge. 
Before deliberations began, Schwab instructed them that their only options were 
a conviction for first-degree murder or acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
During the four-month trial, Millward testified that Gruber and Danny Lucero, 
22, of Palmdale, were trying to kill him because they believed he was a Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent. Lucero was aiming for Millward when he shot 
Gruber by accident, Millward said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero testified that he was driving home from a party when he happened upon 
the crime scene, near Palmdale. He said he saw Millward shoot Gruber in the 
head and flee into the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Before jurors reported their deadlock, prosecutors, sensing the disagreement, 
offered Millward a plea bargain. In exchange for a guilty plea to a reduced 
count of voluntary manslaughter, he would be sentenced to 13 years. Millward, 
however, maintained his innocence and refused the offer, which will stand until 
Oct. 20.

SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
CULINARY EVENTS OFFER TASTE OF GEORGIA REPUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When chefs in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia want to make an omelet, 
they break some eggs. But they generally prefer to avoid the whole issue by 
whipping up such specialties as mtsvadi (lamb shish kebab), basturma (grilled 
strips of marinated beef filet) and lobio, a bean stew that in its rich 
creaminess bears a sunny resemblance to refried beans. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans will be able to taste these and other dishes prepared by a team of 
six visiting chefs from Tblisi, the capital of Georgia, at a number of public 
events from Oct. 22 through Nov. 4. The visit, coordinated by restaurateurs 
Piret and George Munger, is slated as an adjunct to the city's Soviet Arts 
Festival that will allow locals to take a bite out of perestroika. Most should 
find themselves chewing with smiles on their faces; travelers to Moscow report 
that the best of the new, for-profit "cooperative" restaurants specialize in 
Georgian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian chefs will close ranks with U. S. Navy mess specialists (that's 
cooks to you) at the Naval Training Station's Advanced Food Preparation School 
from Oct. 19 through Oct. 21 to prepare the more than 9,000 "tastes" of 
Georgian cuisine that will be offered at the Oct. 22 "Super Powers Sunday" in 
Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The daylong event, which will feature 3,000 performers on 15 stages and is 
expected to attract at least 50,000, will allow those who have feasted their 
eyes on the jeweled Faberge eggs at the San Diego Museum of Art to nibble on 
grilled sturgeon and sour plum sauce at immense tasting areas set up in the 
Plaza de Panama and on the Federal Building lawn. Each tasting area will be 
manned by three Georgian chefs, Navy personnel and the staffs of 14 leading San 
Diego County restaurants and hotels. An additional 11,000 servings of the five 
featured Georgian dishes will be prepared and sold for $2 each. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian sextet will perform at several more elaborate functions that also 
are open to the public, although reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these will be Oct. 27 at the UC-San Diego Faculty Club, beginning 
at 6 p.m. with a broad sampling of such classic Georgian hors d'oeuvres as 
aragvi (a salad of chopped tomatoes, cucumbers and assorted fresh herbs), the 
pate-like vegetable pkhali, and turkey with quince jam, and continue with lamb 
kebabs and walnut pastries. The cost, including wine, is $45 per person. For 
information, call Claus Sellier at 534-1755. 
</P>
<P>
A Georgian Sunday supper will be from 4 to 9 p.m. at the Piret's cafe in La 
Jolla Village Square, and will include a full selection of specialties. Cost 
per person is $20, excluding wine, tax and tip. For reservations, call the 
restaurant at 455-7955. 
</P>
<P>
The American Institute of Wine and Food, the Chefs de Cuisine of San Diego and 
the Southern California Culinary Guild will present a reception and banquet 
Oct. 30 at the Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel. The Georgian chefs, aided by a 
battalion of local cooks, will prepare a complicated menu for the 7:30 p.m. 
dinner; the 6:30 p.m. reception will feature caviar and vodka. Cost is $20 per 
person for the reception and $35 per person for the dinner; the cost to attend 
both is $55 per person. For reservations, telephone Lauren Ash at the Sheraton 
at 291-2900. 
</P>
<P>
The Albert Schweitzer School for orthopedically handicapped children will 
benefit from a cooking demonstration and buffet Nov. 4 at the patio at Vic's 
restaurant in La Jolla. Chef Jim Hill will join his counterparts from Tblisi in 
demonstrating the finer points of grilling meats and stewing beans. Caviar 
tasting is also included. The cooking exhibition and meal, including wine, 
costs $25 per person. For reservations, call Vic's at 456-3789. 
</P>
<P>
Children touring the exhibit of religious icons at the B Street Pier will be 
treated to fanciful Georgian New Years cookies baked and handed out by Navy 
personnel. The cookies are free, and will be given out from Oct. 31 through 
Nov. 3 and again from Nov. 7 through Nov. 10.

Another delay in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial was granted Wednesday when 
a juror said a death in her family required her to travel East for the funeral.

Testimony is scheduled to resume Tuesday in the complex case against Hunter, 
50, former mayor of Del Mar and former lover of J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, who 
is serving a 20-year term for similar offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is charged with 197 counts of fraud, making false statements to 
authorities and income-tax evasion in connection with the failed J. David &amp; 
Co. run by Dominelli.

In an effort to eliminate traffic backups during stadium events, two 
lane-control signs with illuminated arrows will be installed on Friars Road 
near San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium by January, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
The signs will direct motorists heading east and west on Friars Road into the 
stadium's west entrance or to continue straight. When the parking lot is full, 
all lanes will be designated as through lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the signs is to give motorists time to make a lane change 
before the stadium entrance. They are located far enough back so cars can 
change lanes before getting stuck in traffic in front of the stadium," said 
John Mills, project director for the city's engineering and development 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Once the $220,000 signs are installed, police directing traffic at stadium 
events will no longer have to manually flip signs in front of the stadium. It 
will take about four months to complete the custom-made signs, Mills said.

CHAVEZ AND FARM WORKERS UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of articles have recently appeared in newspapers across the country 
bemoaning the plight of farm workers and the death of our union. The articles, 
of course, blame me, Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled by these crocodile tears and these lies. The United Farm 
Workers union is alive. 
</P>
<P>
The charges have a familiar ring. The most recent article appeared in The Times 
on Sept. 26, by Robert A. Jones, in his column "On California." It claims our 
union is evaporating and that "the dream of unionizing California's farm 
workers has also died." 
</P>
<P>
It asserts that the current table grape boycott has "little or no connection to 
the union." Agribusiness would dearly love you to believe that, just as it 
would like you to ignore the dangers from pesticides. The men, women and 
children who harvest the crops for your table feel differently. For them, the 
dangers from pesticides are all too real. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in the pesticides. We get in the pesticides. We don't know what type 
of pesticides they are," said farm worker Gonzalo Ramirez, as quoted in the 
Bakersfield Californian of Sept. 15. His 4-year-old daughter, Natalie, was 
discovered to have kidney cancer at the age of 2. Since 1983, seven cases of 
childhood cancers have been found in Earlimart, where the Ramirez family lives. 
That's 1200% above the expected rate. 
</P>
<P>
So we urge you to join farm workers and consumers everywhere who are boycotting 
table grapes. It's for their health, and yours. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout our struggle to build a union, agribusiness insisted we didn't have 
the support of the workers. That myth exploded when a California law was passed 
in 1975 that gave workers a chance to make their views known by secret ballot. 
The United Farm Workers Union won about 90% of those elections. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the law was enforced, we got contracts. We were certified to 
represent some 70,000 workers at more than 400 companies. 
</P>
<P>
When Gov. George Deukmejian came into office, he changed the Agricultural Labor 
Relations Board, cut the funds, and made sure the law is no longer carried out 
fairly. Since then, we have not been able to get contracts when those we had 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
As for our union headquarters being in the Tehachapis, it was not selected 
because I wanted to have a monastery setting. The property was a gift to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, we have had a high turnover in staff. Agribusiness calls it "purges" that 
I ordered. The truth is that most of our staff are volunteers. That's all we 
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
As for the claim that I "never trusted or even wanted the farm workers union," 
the statement only proves that the author's entire article is intended as a 
hatchet job, and has no basis in facts.

CHAVEZ AND FARM WORKERS UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jones' ignorance about "La Causa" is no less apparent than it must have been 
when, as he alleges, he walked into the farm workers headquarters in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
To dismiss Deukmejian's role in the dismantling of the Agricultural Labor 
Relations Board and the resultant freeze on successful organizing campaigns by 
the UFW as "hogwash" is hogwash indeed. 
</P>
<P>
And Jones' characterization of Chavez as a vandal is the ultimate insult -- not 
only to the man but to everything he stands for. 
</P>
<P>
To dignify this quisling's article by placing it on Page 3 (rather than the 
Opinion section where it would still be crude) clearly demonstrates The Times' 
anti-union animus.

CHAVEZ AND FARM WORKERS UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The facts about the remarkable decade of the '60s now seem to shake down into a 
sort of innocent distortion, especially as writers who came of age back then 
try to balance the idealism of the day with today's cynicism. Jones' piece on 
Chavez and his dream deferred falls into this category. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded as though Chavez's recent failures and the UFW's current problems 
are a result of Chavez never really wanting to organize a union in the first 
place. This is a colorful theory, but it is a specious one. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Chavez wanted to build a union of, and by, farm workers, and 
about the only thing he did not want was that first grape strike in 1965. It 
propelled him into history, but he didn't want it, and not for the reasons 
Jones cites. Chavez did not believe that his fledgling organization was 
prepared for a grueling strike, but even more than that, he knew that they 
could not honor the Filipino walkout. Chavez knew that the only way to win 
justice for farm workers was through a union, and he was an organizational 
wizard. 
</P>
<P>
As the victories grew, so did Chavez's notoriety and power. To now call him a 
"Mexican Godfather" may not be entirely flattering, but it is relatively 
accurate, and for him, it has to be intoxicating. Keep in mind, also, that for 
the longest time it was the UFW against the world. Because there was little 
else, he depended on his faith, his staff and his remarkable resolve. Now, if 
there is a paranoia to his personality, at least it may have had its roots in 
reality. There have been death threats and there have been betrayals, and 
recent behavior and action suggest that he has lost his once indefatigable 
sense of direction. 
</P>
<P>
My father worked closely with Chavez since 1961, and what I know is this: 
Chavez is a lot of things, and in the past year or two he has hurt a number of 
people he had no business hurting. Without knowing the whole story Jones has 
written a piece full of speculation, one that missed the boat. But it is more 
complicated than what his brief musing suggests, and it deserves a more 
thorough treatment.

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley wants at least 500 city employees to work with a 
computer at home for one or two days a week as part of an experiment to reduce 
smog by keeping some cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
It is called telecommuting, and we urge the City Council to approve the 
experiment. It is important to know whether the theory works because the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District wants 20% of Southern California's work 
force to be telecommuters by the year 2010. AT&amp;T, Pacific Bell and Allergan 
Pharmaceuticals in Orange County are among the private companies in Southern 
California that already allow employees to work at home in Southern California. 
Planners tell employers they can expect not only a boost toward cleaner air but 
also increased productivity, lower absenteeism and access to larger labor 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,600 of 49,000 city employees ranging from clerical workers to managers 
qualify for the pilot project. Employees may volunteer as long as supervisors 
approve; supervisors may have doubts about the program, but doubting 
supervisors, in particular, should approve, because the idea of the plan is to 
test whether such doubts are valid. The idea is to monitor the quality of work, 
cost-effectiveness and the effect of telecommuting on workers themselves. The 
council should go for it.

CHAVEZ AND FARM WORKERS UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a third-generation Californian and someone who is writing a book on 
California for the Atlantic Monthly Press, I read Jones' weekly column "On 
California" with great interest. 
</P>
<P>
The column on Chavez, while it makes some good points, is extraordinarily 
misdirected. I left college to work for the United Farm Workers in 1975 and 
have kept track of the union's activities since then. Chavez made huge mistakes 
and undoubtedly contributed greatly to the UFW's decline. But to dismiss 
Deukmejian's role in systematically dismantling the Farm Labor Board and to 
ignore, as Jones did, the flood of immigrants willing to work for a pittance 
into the farm labor market, is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Jones presented the UFW's focus on pesticides as essentially a hustle designed 
to elicit contributions from gullible Anglos. For someone picking grapes, 
lettuce, or tomatoes in a field, the spraying of pesticides in that field is a 
matter of health and safety. And worker health and safety issues are clearly in 
the realm of trade unionism. Farm workers, as it happens, are excluded from 
protection under the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act. 
</P>
<P>
Unions are sometimes reactionary forces in today's changing economic scene. 
Worse still, they are often irrelevant. By focusing on pesticides, Chavez seeks 
to make his union relevant to workers and consumers. He may or may not be right 
in all the specifics, but that's not the point here.

NEW POLITICS FOR HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hungary's Communist Party has declared political bankruptcy, reorganized under 
a new name and with different top managers, and is now back in business 
offering what it says is a better line of goods. This remarkable 
transformation, unprecedented in the history of world communism, represents a 
last-ditch effort to give the party that has held near-totalitarian power for 
40 years a gloss of respectability as Hungary prepares for promised multiparty 
elections next spring. The more committed among the party's reformers, however, 
are already questioning whether the metamorphosis goes far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Hungarian communism's old guard has found a home within the successor 
Socialist Party and managed to retain some measure of ideological influence as 
well. Thus the new platform states that "the party is a left-wing socialist 
party striving for a synthesis between fundamental socialist and communist 
values." Most Hungarians are likely to regard this hybrid as representing 
something less than a clean break with the discredited and despised past. For 
those who last week called themselves communists but who now say they have 
turned Lenin's picture to the wall, it represents an uneasy compromise, 
dictated by a sense that if the party is to have any hope for future electoral 
success it must avoid further internal squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
The reformers nonetheless can claim to have achieved much of what they wanted. 
While the platform pledges to prevent the restoration of capitalism "by all 
political means," it also promises -- without attempting to explain the paradox 
-- to "abandon our stubborn prejudice against private property." It calls for 
abolishing the state's monopoly in education, for transforming the 
party-controlled Worker's Militia into a non-military emergency-aid 
organization, and for opening parliamentary discussions on how to dispose of 
the considerable real estates and other assets that were acquired by the 
Communist Party during the course of its rule. 
</P>
<P>
Like Poland's Solidarity-led government, the Socialist Party has carefully 
committed itself to maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union and 
membership in the Warsaw Pact and Comecon trade bloc. As for the 50,000 Soviet 
troops still stationed in Hungary, the party says their withdrawal must await a 
general agreement on disarmament in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
All this, as the reformers worry, is likely to be interpreted by most 
Hungarians as something less than a full separation from the party's past. The 
central and historically impressive fact nonetheless remains that the Hungarian 
Communist Party has dissolved itself, and its successor has solemnly pledged to 
abide by the free political choice of the electorate. That vote, if polls are 
right, is likely to leave those who have long ruled Hungary and who are 
responsible for its economic and social malaise no more than a small opposition 
party. 
</P>
<P>
That moment has not yet arrived. But the point of no return does seem to have 
been reached, with Hungary headed for an electoral revolution that -- more than 
four decades after a Communist coup d'etat -- will provide it with a true 
popular-based government. Step by step, country by country, the system that 
Stalin imposed on Eastern Europe is being dismantled and interred.

FLAP OVER PIGEONS IN TORRANCE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second appeal of a Torrance Building Department's decision to reject a 
special animal permit for the keeping of racing pigeons was held on Sept. 5, 
1989. Like the first, the appeal was made to the City Council. Again, the 
outcome was the same: It's OK for residents to keep large quantities of 
pigeons! 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the rights of one household versus the rights of the surrounding 
neighbors. Both appeals were made by citizens who are deeply involved in a 
hobby/business which gives them satisfaction and income. 
</P>
<P>
The "rats with feathers" create a nuisance for surrounding neighbors as well as 
a health hazard. Both appeals required the council to weigh the benefits to one 
household with the negative effects experienced by a greater number of nearby 
neighbors. Both decisions by the council favored the pigeon proponent. A track 
record is now established: The Torrance City Council favors the rights of 
residents who create a nuisance! This is not acceptable! 
</P>
<P>
A second track record is being established. Council Members Bill Applegate, 
George Nakano and Dee Hardison (who voted against approving the permit) put 
themselves in the position of the affected residents and judged the situation 
with empathy. Around City Hall, Council Members Tim Mock, Mark Wirth and Dan 
Walker (who voted in favor of approving the permit) laugh about the matter; 
they think it is a joke. Mayor Katy Geissert was the swing vote in both 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Geissert had an interest in approving this latest permit approval. She 
supported rewriting the city's long-standing animal control ordinance to allow 
pigeon owners to seek a permit to keep more than four pigeons or doves. In 
June, she voted in favor of a permit for a Country Village proponent even 
though 24 neighbors petitioned the council to deny approval because the pigeons 
create a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mayor admitted that residents in the more recent case should not 
have to put up with the nuisance in their Los Codona neighborhood, she proposed 
a "compromise." Her proposal will allow the nuisance to continue another six 
months, during which time she hopes the pigeons will change their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Ridiculous! 
</P>
<P>
This indecision demonstrates wanting leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
Quite frankly, the council has made a bad decision and has neglected the best 
interest of the residents. Their loud and clear message is that the council 
condones residents who cause problems and will not help affected residents to 
get relief; handle your own nuisance problems! 
</P>
<P>
This decision is the reason why increasing numbers of citizens are taking 
matters into their own hands. It is clear that the council needs to be 
reoriented in their responsibility to act in favor of the best interest of 
their constituency rather than allow the dynamics of our community to become 
upset by a few nuisance peddling residents.

TRUE EVANGELISTS NEED NO DIVINE MASK; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: THOSE WHO LITERALLY LOVE GOD AND THEIR FELLOW MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T BE 
JUDGED BY THE SINS OF THE CHARLATAN FROM CHARLOTTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAL THOMAS, Cal Thomas writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conviction of television evangelist Jim Bakker brings to a close a sordid 
chapter in the history of American religion. For the last 2 1/2 years, much of 
the press and public have watched in astonishment, and some in glee, as 
Bakker's private sins of greed, sexual indiscretion, pomposity and fraud have 
been exposed. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the word evangelist has become a synonym for the worst kind of 
deception, in which a charlatan carries out his criminal activity behind a 
divine mask. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, just as supporters of 1988 presidential candidate Gary Hart did not 
abandon the Democratic Party when Hart's private activities were made public, 
neither should we cynically indict all evangelists because a minority are shown 
to be corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
I recall keeping company with genuine evangelists at a 1986 meeting in 
Amsterdam, sponsored by the Rev. Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
These were itinerant evangelists, and their mode of living was the antithesis 
of most of those involved in big-time American religion. I remember meeting 
John Bulawyo, who rides along the border between South Africa and Mozambique on 
the wheel rims of his bicycle because he cannot afford tires. His territory 
covers a 40-mile radius, and he is the only minister to 20,000 refugees living 
in tents and cardboard shacks. 
</P>
<P>
I had dinner (on paper plates and using plastic utensils) with Odo Ratchie, a 
black pastor in Soweto who is responsible for six churches. Why so many? Few 
pastors want to serve there. Ratchie and his family are constantly threatened 
and intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Sami Daghar, who is pastor of a church in Beirut. Daghar has 
been offered positions in the United States but stays in what may be the least 
desirable spot on earth because "God called me with my people in Beirut." His 
church has been shelled several times, and many church members have been 
wounded or killed. 
</P>
<P>
Hernando Martinez was one of 43 evangelists who came to Amsterdam from 
Nicaragua. Martinez had been arrested by the Sandinistas for his preaching and 
sent to prison. When he was released and told not to preach any more, he 
preached anyway and was sent back to prison.So he started a church in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Tadesse Welde Giorgis of Ethiopia spent two years in prison because he preached 
to young people in violation of the Communist system's laws. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Ebiasali Emolu Akeso of Uganda was preaching in his church during Idi 
Amin's regime when troops stormed in and arrested him and his 65-member 
congregation, hauling them off to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these evangelists live at or near the same economic level as those to 
whom they minister. They ride burros or bicycles, or walk. Most got to 
Amsterdam because Graham's organization paid their way. Many had never left 
their countries before or flown on an airplane. A few had never seen indoor 
plumbing and began to dig latrines behind their dormitories before others 
introduced them to toilets. 
</P>
<P>
These are the people I think of when I think of evangelists, not the charlatan 
of Charlotte, Jim Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
These are people literally in love with God and with their fellow men and 
women. They had no love for the things of this world. Heritage USA and 
American-style TV evangelism would be as foreign to them as life on another 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakkers got caught up in the sin of much American religious work: the 
belief that big is better and small means failure. 
</P>
<P>
"While big is not necessarily evil, or small necessarily virtuous," notes 
Senate Chaplain Richard C. Halverson, "results are not the acid test for a 
given program. The end does not justify the means. God is interested in means, 
perhaps as an end." 
</P>
<P>
I have met many evangelists, in Amsterdam and elsewhere. I have known some 
evangelists quite well. And Jim Bakker is no evangelist. A biblical warning 
seems appropriate here: "Not everyone who says unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall 
enter into the kingdom of heaven."

RESCUING ANDEAN ECONOMIES FROM COCAINE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: WE ALREADY SWAP THIRD WORLD DEBT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION, SO WHY NOT 
TRY THE SAME THING IN THE DRUG WAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) is chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the drug menace in this country, narcotics are deeply rooted in South 
America, where cocaine profits play an integral role in the Andean economy and 
daily violence in Colombia and Peru threatens democratic institutions. But the 
drug-producing nations of the Andes bear another burden -- external debt -- 
that seriously inhibits their ability to fight the drugwar. 
</P>
<P>
The "Andean strategy" outlined by President Bush is notably silent on this 
problem. We must correct this flaw, and one way to do so would be to link debt 
relief to anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
This initiative is not motivated by charity. It simply recognizes the 
undeniable link between debt and drugs in the Andes, where large debt burdens 
make both debt service and a full-scale war on drugs fiscally impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The Andean economies have become "hooked" on drugs. Repatriated cocaine profits 
account for an estimated 10% of all export earnings in Colombia, one-quarter in 
Peru and one-half or more in Bolivia. As many as 500,000 Bolivians, nearly 
one-third of the labor force, are involved in the drug trade. Little wonder 
that former Bolivian Finance Minister Flavio Machicado has said: "If narcotics 
were to disappear overnight, we would have rampant unemployment. There would be 
open protest and violence." 
</P>
<P>
The "debt-for-drug swaps" that I propose are modeled on 
debt-for-nature-preservation exchanges that have already been successfully 
negotiated in Latin America. Under this plan, the United States, with the help 
of our European and Japanese allies, would create an international fund to 
acquire a portion of the external debt of the Andean nations at discounted 
rates. The fund would then forgive the interest payments -- and ultimately the 
principal -- on this debt in return for the successful implementation of 
anti-narcotics programs. 
</P>
<P>
Swapping debt for drugs would give the economies of the Andes room to breathe 
and provide increased resources for the war on drugs. Debt relief, which would 
still be contingent on continued economic reforms, can leverage more money than 
foreign aid, because the debt of the countries involved -- Bolivia, Colombia 
and Peru -- has already been discounted from face value by lender banks. 
Governments can also use local currency to implement new anti-drug programs, 
rather than the precious foreign reserves that must go to debt service. 
</P>
<P>
This approach will fail unless we alter our current strategy of forcibly 
eradicating coca fields in South America, which by all measures has been 
self-defeating. The Andes are awash in coca. Forced eradication, especially in 
Peru, has alienated peasant farmers, driving them into the arms of 
anti-government insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
Why this failure? One reason is that forced eradication temporarily raises the 
price of the coca leaf, as less raw material is available to suppliers. The 
higher price attracts more farmers, who plant new coca crops in the warm ashes 
of recently eradicated fields. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of destroying their fields, we should offer farmers an economic 
alternative to coca cultivation while continuing vigorous enforcement against 
the traffickers. Prices for coca leaf fall when such enforcement is sustained. 
Fearing that prices may bottom out, farmers become desperate to unload their 
coca and would switch to other crops if they could find help to weather the 
transition. Debt-for-drug swaps would make more funds available for such 
economic alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
These debt swaps have other benefits. The Andean nations would invest in their 
own rural economies instead of using foreign exchange to pay creditors. 
Economic-development programs would drive a wedge between the cartels and the 
growers, giving governments more freedom to take on the traffickers. Just as 
important, the legitimacy of the fledgling democracies in Bolivia and Peru -- 
and a longstanding democracy in Colombia -- would be greatly enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
Like the ghettos of our nation's cities, the jungles of South America are the 
front line of the drug war. But just as tough law enforcement on the street is 
doomed unless accompanied by treatment and education, the best eradication 
programs will fail if they leave only burned and fallow fields. Indeed, coca 
and cocaine will spring endlessly from the ruins of debt-ridden and 
drug-dependent Andean economies unless we help them rebuild their legal 
sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The drug menace terrorizes all the nations of the Americas with a vengeance, 
corroding our families, our institutions and our societies. We must work 
together to attack this problem, or together we will continue to suffer the 
consequences. Swapping debt for drugs is one way for all Americans -- North and 
South -- to make common cause against the blight on our Hemisphere.

IF NOT IN YOUR BACK YARD, WHY PUT HOMELESS IN OURS?; 
</P>
<P>
DOWNTOWN: THE HASTY MOVE OF THE UNION RESCUE MISSION SEEMS DESIGNED TO SPARE 
STATE WORKERS FROM SEEING UNKEMPT STREET PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A shocking process is under way to move hundreds of homeless men who seek 
shelter from the elements each night in downtown Los Angeles. The city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency is enticing the Union Rescue Mission with 
millions of taxpayer dollars to encourage it to find a new home. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the CRA want to give the Rescue Mission $6.5 million to buy a new home 
and then millions more in payment for its Main Street facility, where it has 
served the homeless for more than 70 years? It's simple. For a long time, the 
CRA has been pressured by the state of California to get rid of the Union 
Rescue Mission's 800-bed shelter on Main Street, because a new state office 
tower is being built around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have made it clear and the redevelopment agency has agreed: It 
is unacceptable for well-groomed and stylishly dressed state workers to be 
confronted by the sight of the homeless huddling down the block. The situation 
can be compared to a potential home buyer demanding that his real estate agent 
evict his new next-door neighbors because the family has no concept, 
understanding or appreciation of social graces. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA is buying into preposterous arguments that hard-working state employees 
have no business being subjected to the real or imagined daily threat presented 
by people who might not have shaved, showered or slept in a bed. What the CRA 
should do is to fix up the existing mission so that it can become a shining 
example of a redevelopment project for the homeless. Instead, the agency is 
transferring blight from one neighborhood to another. To call this an outrage 
is an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
While the CRA and the state are trying to give the Union Rescue Mission the 
bum's rush, they don't intend to sweep the homeless clear of Main Street and 
move them far away. No, the mission's moving vans will need to travel only a 
few blocks to Central City East, an area popularly known over the years as Skid 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for this is disturbingly clear. Central City East is already home 
to the largest concentration of homeless service shelters in Southern 
California: Los Angeles Mission, Fred Jordan Mission, the Weingart Center, L.A. 
Men's Place, Transition House and a host of single-room-occupancy hotels. The 
CRA seems to be saying, "Hey, what's one more mission? After all, most of their 
homeless friends are already there, so they will feel more at home." The agency 
would have you believe that this forced migration of the homeless is intended 
to improve the quality of their lives. This is hypocrisy at its best. 
</P>
<P>
Why should the Union Rescue Mission be offensive to state employees, yet be 
acceptable to the blue-collar women and men working in Central City East? What 
the state doesn't want to confront before it moves into its gleaming office 
tower, we manage to deal with on a daily basis with a good measure of 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
But the story doesn't end there. The CRA's handling of this phase of the Union 
Rescue Mission's relocation has been rushed, incomplete and contrived. The 
mission entered into an agreement to buy its hoped-for new home months ago. It 
was done in great secrecy. Neighbors were not informed. Neither was the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The whole matter is being brought before the City Council only days before 
escrow is scheduled to close on the proposed new site. An artificial sense of 
urgency has been purposely created. There has been no formal and thorough city 
review and no compelling research to justify the relocation. There has been no 
meaningful consultation with the Central City East community. Worse yet, during 
a time when the CRA says that it's running out of funds, it hasn't convinced 
anyone that less expensive relocation sites are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
The deal to move the Union Rescue Mission to a new home at 6th and San Pedro 
streets will be considered by the full City Council on Friday. The council 
should see through this raw deal and disallow the CRA action. 
</P>
<P>
A careful deliberation by the City Council could only benefit the homeless 
population on Main Street and might even save the taxpayers money. The Union 
Rescue Mission has been serving the homeless at its current site for 
generations; why the rush now?

PANEL BACKS PALMDALE ANNEXATION; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER LOSES LATEST BATTLE IN OLD RIVALRY OVER LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Lancaster failed in its attempt Wednesday to prevent 40 acres of 
the unincorporated Quartz Hill area from being annexed by neighboring Palmdale 
in a flare-up of the local turf war. 
</P>
<P>
By a 7-0 vote, the county's Local Agency Formation Commission reaffirmed its 
original Aug. 23 decision to give the undeveloped area to Palmdale. In 
rejecting an appeal filed by Lancaster, the panel sided with landowners in the 
affected area, who want to build housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
The two cities have a history of land feuds. In June, 1988, they reached a 
settlement of sorts that specified the spheres of influence of each city and 
marked the outlying areas that each could consider annexing. The Quartz Hill 
dispute was the first of its kind since the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-acre parcel at the northeast corner of Avenue N and 55th Street West was 
within Lancaster's sphere of influence. But the county commission, which had 
approved last year's agreement, changed that by giving the land to Palmdale -- 
a move that rankled Lancaster officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster Councilman George Theophanis accused the county panel of violating 
the spirit of the 1988 accord, which he said was supposed to allow the two 
cities to resolve such disputes themselves. He also blamed Palmdale officials 
for not cooperating sufficiently with Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale officials responded that they remained neutral in the dispute, even 
saying they had no objection to Lancaster's desire to preserve its sway over 
the area. But Palmdale granted the property owners prezoning for their land, 
allowing up to three houses per acre. 
</P>
<P>
A commission spokeswoman, Michi Takahashi, defended LAFCO's decision. She said 
the panel thought there were "overriding considerations," mainly that the 
property already is bounded on three sides by Palmdale and that the closest 
part of Lancaster is nearly a mile to the east. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staff members also had promised worried Lancaster officials that the 
case would not set a precedent to remove other land from the city's sphere of 
influence. A commission report noted there is "no similarly located parcel" 
between the two fast-growing cities. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was good news for the owners of the three parcels, although they 
probably could have developed their land in either city. Two owners now hope to 
build a total of 59 homes on 20 acres. The owners of the remaining 20 acres 
have no development plans, their representative said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Maevers of JK Civil Engineering in Palmdale, who initiated the annexation 
request on behalf of the owners, said they preferred Palmdale only because 
Lancaster officials earlier had told them that the location of their land made 
annexation by Lancaster unlikely.

MORNING BRIEFING: A NOBLE THOUGHT: HERNANDEZ COULD PUT PADRES OVER TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From Marty Noble of Newsday: "The San Diego Padres will displace the San 
Francisco Giants as National League West champions next season if they sign 
Keith Hernandez as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Padres ought to make that move to protect the investments they made last 
winter and assure themselves of realizing their potential. Hernandez can make 
that much difference. 
</P>
<P>
"The Padres don't necessarily need a first baseman. Jack Clark is in place. But 
they need Hernandez and all he brings to a team. If the Padres insert Hernandez 
at first and shift Clark back to the outfield, the outfield defense might 
suffer, but not nearly so much as the infield defense would improve. 
</P>
<P>
"And who knows? With Hernandez around to impart his wisdom, Tony Gwynn might 
bat .360, not .340." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, at least as of last week, said they are not interested. 
</P>
<P>
A true semi-pro: John Steadman of the Baltimore Evening Sun writes that Dave 
Johnson, the former truck driver who helped pitch the Baltimore Orioles to one 
of the most astonishing comebacks in major league history, is a hero to his 
former co-workers. Steadman quotes Raymond Valentine, operations manager for 
Bestway: "I dispatched him a lot. He was everything you would want in an 
employee. Some people believe you just jump in and drive a truck. It doesn't 
work that way. You have to take tests and be federally certified and highly 
qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The 201 strikeouts by pitcher Jose DeLeon of the St. Louis 
Cardinals were the fewest by a National League leader since 188 topped the 
league in 1957. Who led that season? 
</P>
<P>
Successful failure: Jim Henneman of the Baltimore Evening Sun quotes Chicago 
Cub General Manager Jim Frey on being fired as field manager after winning 
division titles for the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Cubs in 1984: "I won 
my first year in Kansas City and that wasn't good enough, and I won my first 
year in Chicago and that wasn't good enough. I figured I must have been in the 
wrong line of work." 
</P>
<P>
On Cub Manager Don Zimmer, a buddy since high school: "My relationship with Don 
Zimmer is best explained by saying he doesn't want to be a general manager and 
I don't want to be a manager. We get along pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Field of dreams: From Don Markus of the Baltimore Sun: "When Illinois was in 
Los Angeles for its season opener against Southern Cal, John Mackovic took his 
players to see the Rose Bowl. Said fullback Howard Griffith: "When I walked in, 
I was overwhelmed. This is what people work eight or nine months to get to. The 
Rose Bowl could be played on a parking lot, and it wouldn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Add Markus: Iowa State Coach Jim Walden, on what it's like to have only 56 
uninjured scholarship players: "It's taken a lot out of me, and it continues 
to. Every day I go to practice, it takes a lot out of me. It's like somebody 
rubbing sandpaper on your cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Enough is enough: George McDowell, 81, has missed only six Sooner football 
games, home or away, in the last 40 years. What kept him away from the ones he 
missed? Sickness, weddings, family emergencies? 
</P>
<P>
"They were at Kansas State," McDowell said. "I just didn't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma leads that series, 59-11-4, and hasn't lost to the Wildcats since 
1970. The Sooners won last year's game, 70-24; the teams play in Norman, Okla., 
on Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Philadelphia Phillies' Jack Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Angel pitcher Jim Abbott, asked if the wooden bat might eventually 
be replaced by the livelier aluminum bat in the major leagues: "I'll quit if 
they go to aluminum bats." GARR KLUENDER

FATE OF FITTIPALDI, PATRICK TEAM UP IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emerson Fittipaldi and the Marlboro-sponsored Patrick Racing Team have already 
won the PPG Indy car championship before the final race of the season, but it 
hasn't been decided what is going to happen to Fittipaldi and Pat Patrick's 
team next year. 
</P>
<P>
All of those involved will be in Monterey this weekend for the season-ending 
Champion Spark Plug 300-kilometer race Sunday at Laguna Seca Raceway, but how 
much they will say may be something else. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's buttoned up yet," is their standard reply. "We'll have something to 
say as soon as the contracts are signed." 
</P>
<P>
The scenarios for next year's $17-million season are endless. 
</P>
<P>
Marlboro, the biggest-bucks sponsor in Indy car racing, has already committed 
its bankroll to the Roger Penske team, which has dominated the sport with eight 
championships in the last 13 seasons. This apparently would leave Patrick, 
despite having the current No. 1 team, without a major sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Fittipaldi, winner of the Indianapolis 500 and four other races for 
his first Indy car championship at age 42? He has been with Marlboro since 
joining Patrick in 1986, and the sponsor has made it known that it wants to 
maintain the relationship. Does that mean the charismatic Brazilian will join 
Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan on the already loaded Penske team? 
</P>
<P>
If that comes to pass, it could force Penske into running a three-car team, a 
heavy burden for a 16-race season, and one he has steadfastly refused to carry 
in the past, even when he had national champion Al Unser in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
Mears has won three national championships and three Indianapolis 500s during 
his 12 years with Penske and is not about to leave. Nor is the yellow color of 
his Pennzoil-sponsored car likely to change. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan has carried Miller beer sponsorship while winning the 1988 Indy car 
championship and two races this year despite missing part of the season with a 
broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
But Marlboro spokesmen insist that there will be two cars in their 
red-and-white colors next year. One for Fittipaldi and one for Sullivan seem 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the look of Sullivan's car would be simple. After all, both Marlboro 
and Miller are owned by Philip Morris Companies Inc., and cigarette companies, 
whose products are banned from appearing on TV commercials, have more money to 
spend on their racing venture than breweries, which are sponsors of major 
sporting events as well as racing teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal (between) Marlboro and Penske was made over a year ago, but Emmo 
(Fittipaldi) and Patrick threw a wrench into things when they won Indy and the 
championship," one team insider said. "Marlboro doesn't want to give up 
Fittipaldi now, so Penske may be stuck with three drivers." 
</P>
<P>
The last team with three top-rated drivers was the Vel's Parnelli Jones Super 
Team of Mario Andretti, Al Unser and Joe Leonard between 1972 and '75. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, it was that team, sponsored by Viceroy cigarettes, that drove 
Marlboro from Indy car racing. Marlboro entered the American racing picture as 
a sponsor for the entire United States Auto Club season in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't be in a position where a team sponsored by a rival cigarette company 
could win the Marlboro championship," a spokesman said at the time. "We don't 
want to pay our money to a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Marlboro did not return to Indy car racing until 1986, sponsoring Patrick's 
team with Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
There is a remote possibility that Fittipaldi could remain with Patrick and 
Sullivan with Penske, but with the same sponsor. However, it would mean that 
Fittipaldi would be without the new Penske PC-19 model for 1990. This year, in 
a unique arrangement between Penske and Patrick, Fittipaldi drove the same 
PC-18 model that Mears and Sullivan had. 
</P>
<P>
No such arrangement has been made for next season. And if Fittipaldi remains 
with the year-old car, it would be with a beat-up machine. He totaled one car 
at Phoenix before the first race of the season and wrecked a second one last 
month while testing at Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, faced with the loss of his championship driver and his sponsor, is 
rumored to be linking up with Alfa Romeo, the Italian car builder, which 
entered the Indy car picture this season with Roberto Guerrero of Colombia as 
its driver. 
</P>
<P>
If Patrick and his partner, Chip Ganassi, make such a move it will reunite 
Guerrero with his former team manager in Formula One, Maurice (Mo) Dunn, who 
directed Patrick's operation this year. A move to Alfa, which uses its own V-8 
engine, would cause Patrick to lose his link with Chevrolet and the 
all-powerful Ilmor-Chevy engine that won 12 of the 14 races this season. 
</P>
<P>
There was a strong rumor circulating along pit row last month that Sullivan 
might join Teo Fabi as the second driver on the Porsche team, but that was 
scotched when Porsche made a public announcement that it is going with a 
one-car team next year except for the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
Fabi and the Porsche have been one of the surprises of this season. After 
nearly two years of sorting out a new car, Fabi drove the Porsche to its first 
win last month at Mid-Ohio. Now he is looking forward to two races this 
weekend, the 100-mile Marlboro Challenge Saturday and the 300k championship 
race Sunday on his favorite track. 
</P>
<P>
"For sure, Laguna Seca is my favorite track in America," the Italian driver 
said. "I know how to win there. I have won in Can-Am and Indy cars and I have 
tested there a great deal. I also like it because it is quite similar to many 
of the road courses I have driven on in Formula One." 
</P>
<P>
Robby Unser, 21, the youngest son of three-time Indy 500 winner Bobby Unser, 
will make his Indy car debut this weekend driving for Ron Hemelgarn in a 
Judd-powered Lola. Unser earned his ride by winning 11 of 14 races this season 
in the Machinists Union American IndyCar Series for stock block machines. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- The Western States 100, second of a three-race series for NASCAR 
sportsman cars, will close the season Saturday night at Orange Show Speedway in 
San Bernardino. The series pits drivers from Orange Show, Cajon and Saugus 
Speedways in late-model Camaros, Firebirds and Thunderbirds. Dave Scheidecker 
won the Orange Show sportsman track championship. . . . Street stocks will race 
Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Jerry Meyer's margin in the California Racing Assn. standings 
over defending champion Ron Shuman has dwindled from 207 points in July to 
eight going into Saturday night's 30-lap main event at Ascot Park. Meyer's 
decision to go for the win instead of holding on to second place last week cost 
him dearly when he crashed with Billy Boat while racing for the lead two laps 
from the end and finished 13th. Shuman was second behind Lealand McSpadden and 
picked up 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- Danny Hill Jr. of Lawndale, Formula Ford champion of the Sports 
Car Club of America's Southern Pacific Division, will lead a group of about 20 
drivers from Southern California in the SCCA national championship runoffs this 
weekend at Road Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 28, won five races to earn his way into the finals, where his toughest 
competition may be Mike Berg of Downey. Other Southland hopefuls include Mark 
Edwards of Los Angeles in Formula Vee, Beaver Theodosakis of Carlsbad in 
Showroom Stock GT and Bill Hagerty of Vista, who is taking two cars to the 
finals, a Mitsubishi in Showroom Stock A and an Oldsmobile in Showroom Stock B. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- Drivers in Saturday's Gold Coast 300, a High Desert Racing Assn. 
event south of Las Vegas -- especially No. 1 starter Corky McMillen -- will 
face an unusual challenge. For the first time in HDRA/SCORE racing, there will 
have been no opportunity for racers to familiarize themselves with the 75-mile 
course. A rule against pre-running the course was issued to placate wildlife 
officials who have become concerned after recently listing the desert tortoise 
as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I'd be elated to be first off the line," McMillen said. "But without 
pre-running, we're going out absolutely blind. That first guy, which is me, has 
nothing to guide him." McMillen is a former unlimited two-seater series 
champion from Bonita. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- The full midgets and TQs will split up this weekend. Robby Flock, 
Sleepy Tripp &amp; Co. will race the big midgets Saturday night at Cajon 
Speedway, while the three-quarter variety will go at Ventura Raceway the same 
night. 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE CARS -- The second Greatrace West, for cars from 1900 to '59, will be 
held this week between Long Beach and Sparks, Nev. Thirty-two vehicles will 
take off at 10:30 a.m. today from the Queen Mary and meander 1,000 miles 
through California and Nevada before reaching Victorian Square in Sparks at 5 
p.m. Sunday. There are two classes, one for pre-1943 cars and the other for 
1943-59 models. Featured will be a red Kurtis Kraft sports car driven by Joe 
Sexton of Indianapolis and a 1936 Cord Phaeton driven by Bud Melby of Kent, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
POWERBOATS -- Veteran Bill Seebold, of Fenton, Mo., thwarted Scott Gillman's 
bid for the International Outboard Grand Prix championship when he finished 
second to Chris Bush of St. Paul, Minn., in the season's final race Sunday at 
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Gillman started the day only two points behind Seebold, 
but the Orange County driver had engine problems and finished 13th. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Shawn Moran did not fare so well in the United States Speedway 
championships last Saturday night, when he finished fourth behind 33-year-old 
Bobby Schwartz, but he did become the first American rider to win the British 
League title by scoring a perfect 15 points in the championship finals at Belle 
Vue.

<P>
Suddenly, Losing State University -- LSU to its brave followers -- is making a 
stumble for the Bottom Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
The Paper Tigers (1-3) lost the hard way Saturday, in overtime. College games 
aren't supposed to go into overtime -- the players complain they're underpaid 
as it is -- but when time ran out with the score tied, the clock was set back 
to one second to allow Florida to kick a winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the next Rout of the Week victim is Saturday's USC-Cal game. 
Television officials so far have jerked the starting time from 1 p.m. to 7:30 
p.m. to 3:30 p.m. The day hasn't been changed, yet.

<P>
The Pros 
</P>
<P>
That crunching you heard over the weekend was the sound of a couple of NFL 
notables eating their words. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the New York Giants' Phil Simms, quoted in a Philadelphia 
paper last week as saying that a good high school quarterback with proper 
protection could throw for 300 yards against the Eagles' defense. He was 
promptly sacked four times in a 19-21 loss to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the Chicago Bears' Mike Ditka, who said of the performance of 
Tampa Bay's Vinny Testaverde against Minnesota: "Someone said it looked like he 
was color-blind and the color was green because he kept throwing the ball into 
the carpet." Testaverde, seeing red, picked the Bears apart for 22 completions 
and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde's strong performance removed him from contention for the Bottom 
Ten's Least Valuable Player Award. The winner, incidentally, will be handed the 
keys to a 1987 Yugo in January by last year's LVP, Brian Bosworth.

ENGLAND AND SPAIN GET BERTHS WITH TIES

<P>
England and Spain tied their matches Wednesday but still became the seventh and 
eighth nations to earns berths in the 24-team World Cup soccer finals next 
summer in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Playing away from home, neither England nor Spain was able to win. England was 
not even able to score in a tie against Poland at Katowice. Spain and Hungary 
played to a 2-2 tie at Budapest. But all England and Spain needed to qualify 
for the finals was the one point that is awarded for ties. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's tie also virtually assured the first World Cup berth for Ireland, which 
won Wednesday in Dublin against Northern Ireland, 3-0. To advance instead of 
Ireland, Hungary would have to win at Spain next month by six goals and Ireland 
would have to lose at winless Malta. 
</P>
<P>
In other games Wednesday, Belgium, Romania and Scotland failed to advance to 
the finals. But all still have an excellent chance of qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming for its third consecutive appearance in the finals, Belgium tied, 2-2, 
at Switzerland. Romania lost, 3-0, at Denmark. Denmark leads its region by one 
point but must play Nov. 15 at Romania. Scotland lost, 3-0, at France, even 
though the French were reduced to 10 men for most of the second half. Two of 
the French goals came after defender Eric Di Meco was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Netherlands moved closer to a spot in the finals with a 2-1 victory 
at Wales; Bulgaria won, 4-0, over Greece in a torrential rain at Varna, 
Bulgaria; Portugal overpowered Luxembourg, 3-0, in a match played at 
Saarbruecken, West Germany; and Yugoslavia, which already has clinched a berth 
in the finals, beat Norway, 1-0, at Sarajevo on a penalty kick by Faruk 
Hadzibegic. 
</P>
<P>
England, which survived a last-minute Polish shot that ricocheted off the 
crossbar, and its 40-year-old goalkeeper, Peter Shilton, did not give up a goal 
during six qualifying matches. England scored 10 times as it won three games 
and tied three. 
</P>
<P>
In its victory, Ireland got goals from Ronnie Whelan, Tony Cascarino and Ray 
Houghton against goalkeeper George Dunlop, an aircraft mechanic chosen to start 
at the last minute for Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting closer and closer (to the finals), and now we just want that 
little whisper in the ear to say we're there," Ireland Coach Jack Charlton 
said. "Then we'll all be delighted. It will mean a great deal to me, the 
players and the people of Ireland, which is what it's all about, really." 
</P>
<P>
It was only the fourth game ever between Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, checks on cross-border traffic began Tuesday night in preparation 
for the match, which started at noon Wednesday for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 police and 1,300 match stewards were on duty in and around 
Lansdowne Road, where large force of riot-control officers was standing by. 
Police leave was canceled for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland fans were being escorted to and from the stadium, where 
possible, and checks for non-ticket-holders were being made half a mile from 
the entrance gates. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 1,000 tickets were officially sent to Northern Ireland fans, but 
more fans than that were expected to go south. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs trained to detect explosives joined searches of the stadium and 
surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest security maneuver, however, was mounted in Poland, where 1,500 riot 
police and anti-terrorist squad troops were drafted to watch the 1,000 or so 
visiting English fans, after the violent scenes which marred England's visit to 
Stockholm last month. 
</P>
<P>
Police chief Major Wyszkowski warned: "If necessary we will use force. If the 
English fans want to spoil it for their team, our cells are ready for them.' 
</P>
<P>
Poland's leading authority on football hooliganism, Major Tadeusz Gorecki, said 
Silesia Stadium in the Katowice suburb of Chorzow would be ringed by police and 
mounted troops, roads into the city would be patrolled every 100 yards, and 
units would be based outside the hotels where the fans were staying. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the stadium, the largest policemen the country had to offer were ready 
to form a human wall to keep the English fans segregated from the rest of the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
At Paris, where France and Scotland played, a special security fence was being 
built to make sure that thousands of fans arriving without tickets did not get 
near the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was the only European nation to clinch a spot before Wednesday, 
taking one of the two spots in its region. Brazil, Uruguay and Costa Rica also 
have claimed spots, while Italy gets an automatic place because it is hosting 
the finals and Argentina receives a spot as defending champion.

SAN FERNANDO SENDS BACK TO N. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maurice McFarland, a running back who was suspended from San the Fernando High 
football team last week, has been transferred to North Hollywood High and may 
play for the Huskies against Van Nuys on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland, San Fernando's leading rusher last year as a junior, changed schools 
under the Los Angeles Unified School District's opportunity-transfer program 
that is used for students in disciplinary cases or for the student's 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Coach Fred Grimes met with McFarland on Wednesday and then 
welcomed him to practice, during which he worked out with the team. McFarland 
will enroll in school officially today. 
</P>
<P>
"From watching him work out today, it's obvious he's got a football future," 
Grimes said. "If he's serious about playing football, he'll play for us. If 
he's not, we'll get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes said that he will decide after today's practice whether McFarland will 
play in Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland was suspended from the San Fernando football team after an incident 
Sept. 28 at the Crenshaw-Kennedy game in which several San Fernando players 
were ejected from the Kennedy campus stadium after verbal exchanges with 
Granada Hills High players. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland did not play in San Fernando's 28-0 loss to St. Paul the following 
night, the second game that he missed in the season's first three weeks. He was 
benched for the opening game at Fontana because he missed practice. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez accepted McFarland's equipment Tuesday and 
wished him well at North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"He never did anything outrageous with us," Hernandez said. "There was just a 
long line of things of him getting into trouble at school. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see him go because none of his problems have been solved. But at 
least this is one way to keep him in school." 
</P>
<P>
McFarland rushed for 670 yards last year but has gained only four yards this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't playing at last season's level," Hernandez said. "There just seemed 
to be too many other things he was doing. He worked hard to get in shape, but 
then he'd come back after the weekend after tearing down his body and he had to 
start over again."

<P>
INCENTIVE: BARRY VOORHEES' MEMORY OF HIS LATE FATHER MOTIVATES HIM TO BECOME 
THE FIRST CS NORTHRIDGE PLAYER DRAFTED BY THE NFL.

Barry Voorhees says that he would like to play professional football. 
</P>
<P>
So who's going to tell him he can't? 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees is 6-foot-5, weighs nearly 300 pounds, has bench-pressed almost twice 
his weight and is routinely timed in the 4.75 range for 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, his track record shows he delivers. What Voorhees wants, he usually 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, five years ago an attractive brunette dumped him for someone 
else. Voorhees wanted her back. She became Mrs. Voorhees on Aug. 15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And that truck he had to have as soon as he could drive? Voorhees, still a few 
months shy of his 16th birthday, paid cash for it. Four thousand, eight hundred 
dollars earned delivering newspapers and mowing lawns. 
</P>
<P>
You say the odds of playing in the National Football League tend to be slim no 
matter how big you are? No kidding, Voorhees says. Please spread the word among 
friends, family and anyone else who asks. 
</P>
<P>
They see that physique, chiseled like Greek sculpture. They know of his speed 
and strength. Therefore, they expect certain things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Barry, when you go pro . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone just say when? 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Voorhees, 25, currently toils at offensive guard for Cal State 
Northridge, a Division II school that has managed to play football for 28 years 
without one of its players getting drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Voorhees, a senior, might be the first. He has been told by 
professional scouts that he might be selected as high as the third round of the 
April draft. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not sure he believes them. And no, it's not false modesty. It's 
because he is a Voorhees, one who chooses to hold emotion close to the vest. 
Some might say he's a tad cynical. He likes to think he's a realist. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's mother, Nancy, says those traits come from his father, a man who would 
speak his mind without pausing to sugarcoat the words. You either liked Vern 
Voorhees because he was honest, or disliked him for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Marquez, who lived in the same Goleta neighborhood, tagged his best 
friend's father with the nickname "Vicious." Why? "Because he was," Marquez 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Heck, the man didn't even like Christmas. "He thought it was used as an excuse 
for America to get crazy and spend money," his son says while resting in the 
bleachers at North Campus Stadium after a recent practice. "He thought it was 
blown way out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving, now that was a real holiday. No commercialization. Just a time to 
reflect on life's goodness, sit down to a hearty meal with family and watch 
football on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Voorhees spent Thanksgiving Day, 1988, doing just that. He helped cook 
dinner, made his first apple pie, then settled in for an evening of 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
He died, a victim of heart disease, two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Stubbornness may not be hereditary, but don't try telling that to the people 
who best knew Barry and Vern Voorhees. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, it is said, is a size-XL chip off the old block. He says so himself. "We 
were so much like each other," Barry says, "we clashed." 
</P>
<P>
The two couldn't even agree on football, a passion they shared. Barry was a 
Dallas Cowboys fan. His father rooted for the Washington Redskins. The 
intra-division rivals played twice each season, at which time Nancy was forced 
to send son and husband to neutral viewing sites in order to keep some 
semblance of peace. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until he suffered his first heart attack, in 1980, that Vern Voorhees 
started to mellow. 
</P>
<P>
"I feared the man until I was 14," says Marquez, who lived around the corner. 
"I'd come over to see if Barry wanted to do something and I'd see his car there 
and just say, 'Forget it.' He had a real tough side to him. But after his heart 
attack, Vicious was a lot more open with his feelings to Barry and other 
people. Once you got to really know him, he was an incredible man." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it took a heart attack -- and a series of other heart ailments 
that followed -- to bring father and son together. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it but (the heart attack) was probably the best thing that could 
have happened to me and him," Barry says. "At least we got quite a few close 
years before he died. Before, he always wanted to uphold that Mr. Tough Dad 
image. We just didn't relate." 
</P>
<P>
Vern had been only 13 when his father died of cancer, leaving him to provide 
for his mother by shoveling sidewalks and taking other odd jobs. He wanted 
Barry to learn similar responsibilities and priorities at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
So, soon after reaching double digits in age, Barry was encouraged to work. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really leaned on me to work," Barry says of his father. "It was my 
money and I did what I wanted to do with it. But I definitely earned everything 
I got." 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, while friends played touch football in the street, Voorhees was on 
the job. "We'd go, 'Come on, let's play!' " Marquez says. "He'd just say, 
'Gotta work.' And off he'd go." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the training came in handy. 
</P>
<P>
Vern's first heart attack put him out of work for more than three months. The 
family received a disability check during that time, but it wasn't enough to 
pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, without being asked, made up the difference. He never got around to 
playing football at Dos Pueblos High in Goleta because there simply wasn't 
time. There was always a job to be done. As a freshman and sophomore, Voorhees 
took all of his basic study classes so he could be out of school and to work by 
noon in his final two years. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Voorhees eventually returned to his job as a route salesman for a food 
distributor. But a full work day seemed to drain every last ounce of his 
energy. What few chores Barry wasn't already doing around the house, he added 
to his already busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no talking about it," Nancy Voorhees says. "You never had to ask him 
to do anything. He just did it." 
</P>
<P>
From junior high through junior college, in no particular order, Voorhees 
recalls working as paper boy, gardener, plumber's assistant, landscaper, 
janitor, ice cream server, pool cleaner, construction laborer and nightclub 
bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
The job Voorhees remembers best would probably be the one as bouncer at one of 
Santa Barbara's trendiest night spots. He quit that one shortly after being 
greeted at the door by a man toting a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
"Good thing it wasn't loaded," Barry says. Of course, he didn't know that when 
he charged the man, slapped the gun out of his hands and wrestled him to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Voorhees tipped the scales at 11 pounds, 5 ounces at his inaugural 
weigh-in, a fact his mother states with a pained expression. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Voorhees is pretty sure she decided immediately upon her son's arrival 
that he would be an only child, although it might have been a little later, 
when she noticed his footprints went off the page of his birth record. 
</P>
<P>
A former high school cheerleader, Nancy was the daughter of a football 
official, the sister of a professional football player and the wife of a 6-2, 
240-pound rabid Redskins fan. 
</P>
<P>
This was definitely the right kid. 
</P>
<P>
Barry -- did he have a choice? -- loved football too. He played in all the 
local youth leagues. But at the same time, he also learned the value of a 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
So in high school, when it came time to choose between work and football, sport 
took a back seat. There would be time for that later. 
</P>
<P>
If only he had known how much later. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the fall of 1986 that Voorhees returned to football. It had 
been seven years since he last played competitively. 
</P>
<P>
When he had graduated from high school in 1982, Voorhees was a lean 6-2, 200 
pounds. He had grown substantially since then. 
</P>
<P>
So much, in fact, one might have wondered if there hadn't been a little 
artificial stimulation. Quite the contrary, actually. Her name was Tyree 
(pronounced Tie-ree). 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees met the former Tyree Rickel while visiting a friend near Carson City, 
Nev. They dated for a while, but then broke up when Tyree found another 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
As Marquez tells the story, Tyree chided her ex-beau a bit when she broke up 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'You need to get that bigger and these bigger and these bigger,' and 
she pointed to his chest, arms and legs," Marquez says. "He came back to town 
and started lifting weights like a crazed man. 
</P>
<P>
"(Barry) said, 'You watch, I'm going to get so big, then I'm going to go back 
to see her and say, 'OK, you wanted me big and muscular? What do you think 
now?' " 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer to that question was supposed to be something like, "You 
look great. Let's go out." Then, Voorhees told Marquez, "I'm going to say, 'You 
can't have me now!' " 
</P>
<P>
After months of training six to eight hours a day, Voorhees did exactly what he 
told his buddy he would do. With one minor exception. 
</P>
<P>
When Tyree said, "Let's go out." Voorhees said, "OK." 
</P>
<P>
Already bulked up, Voorhees decided he might as well use his new size 
constructively. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dinaberg, who had been the football coach at Santa Barbara City College 
when Voorhees' uncle, Al Knapp, played there, greeted his new project warmly. 
</P>
<P>
"He was more a big body than anything else," says Dinaberg, who had become the 
defensive line coach after stepping down from the head job. "I remember 
thinking, 'Oh, my. There may be a little potential in there.' I mean, he wasn't 
just big, he was also one of the fastest guys on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees never developed into a dominant junior college player, Dinaberg says. 
"But he was a great second-year player. He learned so quick. Of course, having 
those tools sure didn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Voorhees completed his second season, he was a major-college 
prospect. There was only one problem: Because five years had passed since he 
graduated from high school, he was ineligible under National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division I rules. 
</P>
<P>
He thought about trying to catch on with a professional team as a free agent, 
but decided against it. He did, however, take time out to observe the Cowboys' 
training camp in Thousand Oaks, along with Dinaberg. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched the Cowboys scrimmage against the Chargers," Dinaberg says. "There 
was a line of kids who came up and asked Barry for his autograph. I think he 
looked more like a professional than the professionals did." 
</P>
<P>
It is a rather ordinary-looking trophy that rests on a table next to a recliner 
in the living room of Nancy Voorhees' modest three-bedroom home. It was awarded 
to Santa Barbara City's best defensive lineman of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It was earned by Barry, owned by Vern. 
</P>
<P>
Barry wanted it buried with his father, but Nancy decided the trophy should 
stay put, right next to Vern's favorite seat in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The last years of Vern Voorhees' life centered on watching his son playing 
football. 
</P>
<P>
In May of last year, he and Nancy took what they referred to as a vacation. 
Their destination? A whirlwind tour of the stadiums where Northridge would play 
away games during the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
Vern's bodily functions, weakened by the heart attacks and then major heart 
surgery in March of 1986, were operating at a fraction of normal capacity. 
Travel was an ordeal. There were motels to scout, parking availability to check 
and seating arrangements to be made. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's game against Idaho State in Pocatello, Ida., was the only game 
they missed, and even then Barry had to promise he would call with the result 
as soon as he left the field. 
</P>
<P>
After CSUN's 34-23 upset victory, he happily obliged. He just couldn't believe 
what he was hearing on the other end of the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hear him crying," Barry says. "He was so happy for us. . . . See, I'd 
never, ever seen my dad cry. My mom said she hadn't, either. But toward the end 
. . . He'd be out there screaming and yelling. After a game, he'd have tears in 
his eyes . . . I think maybe he realized he was close to death." 
</P>
<P>
What Barry saw in his father's tears were the words he never actually heard. 
They said he was proud. They said he approved. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Vern never saw Barry play his new position the way he was 
capable. Switching from defensive tackle to offense only weeks before CSUN's 
first game last season, Voorhees struggled to learn techniques that were needed 
to supplement his raw physical power. 
</P>
<P>
If he could only see him now. The work ethic Barry showed off the field has 
helped him on it, as well. With a year to learn -- and yes, work at -- his new 
position, he has become a driving force for the Northridge offense. 
</P>
<P>
Barry believes that his father knew he was slipping fast on Thanksgiving night. 
Vern said he wasn't feeling well, but he still stayed up talking to Barry until 
the early hours of Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics of conversation, Barry recalls, were pro football, taking care 
of the family and handling additional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about everything," Voorhees says. "I look back on it now and wish I 
would have known, because I think he was trying to say goodby. I remember 
thinking, 'That was real nice.' We were in the kitchen for probably close to 
four hours. I never really got to talk to him after that." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of going to bed that early Friday morning, Vern got up and told 
Nancy that his pacemaker was acting up, which happened occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
The family doctor was called, and Vern was taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, at approximately 3 a.m., he died. 
</P>
<P>
On the nightstand next to the place Barry Voorhees sleeps are three framed 
photographs: 
</P>
<P>
His father relaxing in the recliner. Barry and his father embracing after a 
game. Barry, his father and Tyree posing together on the field last year at 
Southern Utah State, two weeks before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"If I made pro football, it would be the icing on the cake for him," Barry 
says. "I'm doing it for me, but there's a big part of me that's doing it for 
him, too." 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, Voorhees will at least get an opportunity. Even if it's as a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a professional scout, I don't see how you can let a prospect like 
that get by," Dinaberg says. "You have to at least take a look. He has tools 
that are as good as anybody in the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees has been nominated to play in the East-West Shrine Game at Stanford in 
January. He also has been told to expect an invitation to the NFL scouting 
combine next spring in Indianapolis, where the nation's best prospects are 
timed, tested and physically examined. 
</P>
<P>
But his attitude is such that he will wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of real good football players who never play pro ball for one 
reason or the other," Voorhees says. "A lot of it is politics, and I understand 
that. I'm coming from a small school, so that's one strike against me right 
there. But I know I can play. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens with football, Voorhees is confident that he'll succeed. 
He always has. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the dollars and cents. Maybe it's the prestige," he says. "I'd be 
doing it for nothing, maybe just to say I can play pro football. 
</P>
<P>
It's about pride . . . and maybe ego. It's in my heart."

CSUN CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM MAY BE OUT OF STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Invitational is not just another jog in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Don Strametz, Cal State Northridge cross-country coach, calls Saturday's race 
the premier Division II invitational of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Strametz, his teams won't be at full strength for it. 
</P>
<P>
Derik Vett, the men's team's No. 3 runner, and Gena Jauregui, a 1988 Division 
II All-American on the women's team, are questionable for the race. 
</P>
<P>
Vett sprained his left ankle this week during a training run and Jauregui has 
an infected thyroid that has limited her training. 
</P>
<P>
"Derik's injury isn't that serious," Strametz said. "We'll just have to see how 
quickly it heals. We've just had him on the bike for the last few days." 
</P>
<P>
Jauregui's problem is more severe. She might need surgery to remove a goiter 
from her thyroid. She is currently taking iodine to keep it from growing. 
</P>
<P>
"Her energy level is extremely low right now," Strametz said. "So her chances 
of racing don't look very good." 
</P>
<P>
Shouldering the burden: Freshman Craig Ashley carried Cal Lutheran's offense 
with 151 yards rushing and three touchdowns against Cal State Northridge, but a 
late-game shoulder injury might have played a role in his fumble on the 
Kingsmen's last possession in a 34-33 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley missed practice on Monday and Tuesday because of a bruised right 
shoulder and is questionable for Cal Lutheran's home game Saturday against Cal 
State Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably erred in putting him back in, but I didn't realize his shoulder was 
injured until later," Cal Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, who scored on runs of 66, 20 and 41 yards against CSUN, is averaging 
11.9 yards a carry this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rest for the wounded: Having won its past two games, Occidental's football team 
would seem to have some momentum. But Tigers Coach Dale Widolff said that he 
welcomed his team's bye last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're banged up," Widolff said after Occidental improved its record to 3-1 
with a 24-12 victory over La Verne two weeks ago. "We need the time to get 
people healed." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the La Verne game, five Tiger defensive starters -- cornerbacks 
Mike Bonetto and Ben White, safeties Craig Hartley and Ronnie Cunningham and 
linebacker Pete Tucker -- were on the bench with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental will resume its schedule Saturday at home against undefeated 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Title run: The Glendale men's and women's cross-country teams are hoping to use 
Friday's invitational at Mt. San Antonio College as a tuneup for their second 
Western State Conference meet Oct. 20 at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaquero men came in first and the women finished third in their first WSC 
meets, putting both in contention for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
The WSC format calls for all conference members to compete in two meets before 
the championships are run Nov. 3 at Cuesta. A team's finish in the 
championships counts double toward final standings. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention: Cal Lutheran running back Jeff Lapinski was off to a great 
start this season when he was shaken up against St. Mary's in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
Lapinski suffered a mild concussion when he was hit on a pass pattern late in 
the first half. At that point, he was Cal Lutheran's leading rusher with 119 
yards in 19 carries. Since then, he has rushed for 53 yards in 34 carries and 
has not hit the line with the same explosiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Lapinski, who also suffered a hematoma in his left hand against UC Santa 
Barbara, minimizes the effect of his injuries. A little-known reserve entering 
the season, he believes he quickly became a marked man. 
</P>
<P>
"Those first couple of games, I got the ball a lot of times, and the next 
couple games, the linebackers were keying on me," Lapinski said. "It's sort of 
weird when you're in that position, and they know what's going to happen. 
They're yelling, 'Draw, draw, No. 22.' " 
</P>
<P>
The added attention Lapinski has drawn may have benefited his fellow tailbacks, 
though. Dean Henderson broke loose for 120 yards at La Verne, and Ashley darted 
for 151 against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Water works: The Occidental water polo team gained its first victory of the 
season last week with a 20-9 win over Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven of Occidental's 12 players scored goals. John Reinecke and Robert Jaffe 
each scored five goals to lead the Tigers (1-8), who will travel to Pomona on 
Saturday for a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference match.

MONTCLAIR PREP TO FACE MARSHALL FUNDAMENTAL

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After five weeks of dominating nonleague opponents, Montclair Prep (5-0) will 
begin Alpha League play against winless Marshall Fundamental (0-5) at 7:30 
tonight at La Canada High. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep has outscored opponents, 202-20, and gained 1,050 yards more 
than the opposition (1,657 to 607). The Mounties lead Valley Southern Section 
schools in total offense, averaging 331.4 yards a game, and rank second in 
total defense, yielding 121.4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Fundamental Coach Lew Underwood, whose Eagles tied Montclair Prep last 
year for the Alpha League title, says that this is a "trying year" in Pasadena. 
The Eagle roster has been reduced to 15 players because of injuries and 
eligibility problems. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep's touted backfield of senior Michael Jones and junior Derek 
Sparks might be running on only one cylinder again this week. Jones' playing 
status is questionable after missing last week's game because of a bruised 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks moved from fullback to tailback and gained 215 yards in 11 carries and 
scored six touchdowns, five on consecutive carries. Sparks leads Valley rushers 
with 879 yards in 85 carries and has scored 17 touchdowns. BRIAN MURPHY

DAVE DISTEL: BEFORE WE TURN TOWARD OTHER BAY AREA, LET'S LOOK AT THIS ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all these years, we finally have a Bay Bridge showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Allegiances are sure to be torn, what with the populace divided between San 
Diego and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
No? Not that Bay Bridge? 
</P>
<P>
That being the case, I suppose I can devote a few moments to addressing some 
nagging questions here in America's Finest Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 What if San Diego throws an America's Cup regatta and no one comes? 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
A good chunk of the rest of the world has apparently come to the conclusion 
that the vase itself is not as important as the magnitude of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Quite true. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, those on the outside looking in, meaning all but San Diego and 
New Zealand, are contemplating a different trophy . . . say the World's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to the Washington Post, sailor/sportscaster Gary Jobson said: "I have 
maybe 20 proposals that have come to me since the court cases started. These 
are viable entities, wanting to do something different." 
</P>
<P>
The Post's report, filed as a preview to this week's Cadillac Columbus Cup on 
Chesapeake Bay, suggested rather strongly that the rest of the world would sail 
for some cup in 1992. And that cup henceforth would be the cup of consequence. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, should the dispute between San Diego and New Zealand not be settled in 
time for such a regatta in 1992, an America's Cup regatta in 1993 just might be 
something we've seen before . . . a match race. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that a carrot dangling over the Sports Arena? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure is. 
</P>
<P>
The promoters would like you to buy the notion that a big crowd for tonight's 
exhibition game between the Bekins Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics will send a 
message to the National Basketball Assn. that San Diego wants a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to spend your bucks, do it because you want to see exhibition 
basketball . . . or maybe "featured halftime performer Mat Plendl . . . and his 
remarkable hula hoop stunts." The quoted material is from a San Diego NBA Inc. 
news release, which also heralds an appearance by some chicken who left San 
Diego about the same time the Clippers did. 
</P>
<P>
But don't spend your bucks thinking you are sending a message. Spend 15 on a 
post card to NBA Commissioner David Stern, and you will have the same impact. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the NBA has said there are absolutely no plans for expansion in the 
foreseeable future. Once again, the National Hockey League will be here first. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is the media depriving San Diego's youngsters of heroes? 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, I did not realize that the dastardly media hereabouts were guilty of 
such a dampening of the youthful experience. I learned this a couple of weeks 
ago while listening to an interview with Steve Ortmayer on the Chargers' 
pre-game show. 
</P>
<P>
This was an enlightening experience, because the Chargers' director of football 
operations managed to divert a question on his organization's problems with the 
media into a dissertation on the impact of the media on San Diego's youths. 
</P>
<P>
Come again? 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, what he was dispensing was Pablum. 
</P>
<P>
I was struck by the irony of a Charger executive accusing the media of 
depriving kids of their heroes when the Chargers themselves have not been able 
to come to terms with running back Gary Anderson, thereby depriving San Diego's 
kids of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it true that the Padres have hired an attorney to assist with the Mark 
Davis negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
 It is . . . and it scares me. 
</P>
<P>
These could be simple negotiations, signed and sealed before Davis even gets to 
the point of filing for free agency. The Padres have a feeling of appreciation 
and loyalty for Davis, and it seems to be mutual. 
</P>
<P>
So what's an attorney doing in this picture? Give 10 minutes to an attorney, 
and he will reduce proceedings to the coldest and most impersonal levels. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the Padre hierarchy put together a package both generous and fair 
and have the club president personally present it? Why complicate it with third 
parties? 
</P>
<P>
In a situation calling for a Valentine, I fear that the Padres are sending a 
letter bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the best way to build a high school football power? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the same way you build a political constituency. You warp 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the impression I got from reading a statement Vista High School 
Coach Dick Haines wrote to the media after a 34-14 loss to neighboring but 
apparently unneighborly Rancho Buena Vista High School. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rancho Buena Vista coaches did a great job utilizing the talent . . . 
gathered through gerrymandering the district boundaries," Haines wrote. "Our 
board sat silently . . . " 
</P>
<P>
You know how these neighborhood rivalries can get folks worked up. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask them in the other Bay Area.

CHARGER NOTEBOOK: SPANOS, ORTMAYER WILL MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS BANKS SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charger Owner Alex Spanos will meet today with Steve Ortmayer, his director of 
football operations, and one of the subjects scheduled for discussion is what 
the team plans to do about linebacker Chip Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Banks has been troubled with drug problems and drug-related arrests over the 
past 18 months, but the NFL cleared him to play last week. Banks' attorney has 
said Banks would like to return. 
</P>
<P>
But Spanos has said on more than one occasion that Banks will never play for 
the Chargers again. 
</P>
<P>
"The owner's position has not changed on that," Ortmayer said again Wednesday 
night. Banks is under probation for a conviction involving cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ralph Cindrich, the agent for unsigned running back Gary Anderson, 
again expressed anger at what he perceives is the Chargers' continued refusal 
to negotiate on a new contract for Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"Ortmayer thinks Gary Anderson will come crawling back after the (Tuesday) 
trade deadline," Cindrich said. "But I'm going to see that Gary Anderson 
carries this thing through." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ortmayer: "I've quit thinking about those guys. Those guys have made a lot 
of statements. It seems to me they're a little bit uptight." 
</P>
<P>
Talk about sending a little man to do a big job. 
</P>
<P>
When Rod Bernstine went down with a bruised knee in the Chargers' 16-10 loss to 
the Broncos in Denver last Sunday, Dana Brinson had to be one of those least 
likely to replace him at H-back. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-feet-9 and 172 pounds, Brinson is six inches shorter and 66 pounds lighter 
than Bernstine. Like Lionel James, the player he beat out to make the club, he 
is a combination wide receiver, running back and punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
But a guy that small at H-back? 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they tell me," Brinson said Wednesday. "I think a running back and 
an H-back are pretty much the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Brinson will not assume all of Bernstine's duties Sunday when the 
Chargers meet the Seattle Seahawks at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Tight end 
Chris Gannon will play when blocking is an obvious requirement, and running 
backs Tim Spencer and Victor Floyd also figure in Coach Dan Henning's revised 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
But Brinson will be an H-back when he is in the game on offense, and the rookie 
from Nebraska is excited about the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
In five games, Brinson has carried nine times for 48 yards and caught seven 
passes for 49 yards. He also has returned five punts for 95 yards, including 
one for 52 yards against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I've been looking forward to, my first real chance to play a 
lot," Brinson said. "I've been more of a receiver, but now I'll be running the 
ball quite a bit, too." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine has been in Bryan, Tex., for the funeral of his stepfather. He is 
expected back today but has little chance to play Sunday. He is listed as 
doubtful on the Chargers' injury report. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim McMahon looks upon the near-miss against the Broncos as an 
indicator that the Chargers still don't qualify as contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if they were almost there, McMahon said, "Well, you get there by winning 
close ballgames like that. Until we do that with regularity, we're not going to 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to tie for the lead (with Denver in the AFC West), and we blew 
it. We've got to win games like that from now on, and maybe the last game of 
the year (against Denver at home) will mean something. Until we do, we won't 
get respect." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon likened the Chargers' current position to that of the Chicago Bears 
when he joined them in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We were terrible until the last part of '83," McMahon said. "Then we won five 
of our last eight (actually, five of six) and ended up 8-8. At that point, we 
realized we were a pretty good ballclub, and the next year we played for the 
conference (NFC) championship." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was 100% after being troubled by nagging minor injuries, McMahon 
said, "I'll never be 100%. I'm too old for that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Sammy Seale (shoulder) and wide receiver Quinn Early (knee) are 
questionable for Sunday. Coach Dan Henning said, "I'd say Seale was 62 1/2(-37 
1/2), with the arrow pointing up, and Early is probably 45(-55). Early felt a 
twinge in his knee today. He tried it, and it didn't respond." . . . Probables 
on the Chargers' injury report are quarterback Jim McMahon (back), wide 
receiver Darryl Usher (hamstring), tight end Arthur Cox (foot), tight end Joe 
Caravello (hip), tackle Brett Miller (knee), tackle Joel Patten (knee), 
linebacker Cedric Figaro (ankle) and safety Lester Lyles (ankle). . . . The 
Seahawks' injury list is short but serious. Wide receiver Tommy Kane (knee) and 
linebacker M.L. Johnson (eye) are out.

Mitek Systems: The San Diego-based manufacturer of computer peripheral devices 
that meet TEMPEST government security standards, said that it expects to report 
about $18 million revenue for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, a 70% increase 
over 1988 sales. The company did not disclose its profit expectations. The 
company will report audited financial results in November, president Phillip

UPDATE ON CABLE TELEVISION; 
</P>
<P>
CABLE TV COMPANIES PUSHING QUALITY AS S.D. MARKET TIGHTENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With slower subscriber growth ahead for the local cable television industry, 
the largest of San Diego County's 14 cable companies say they are placing 
greater emphasis on improving programming, reception and service so as to 
minimize cable service "disconnects." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, many of the nearly 700,000 cable TV households in the county 
are finding themselves on the receiving end of customer preference surveys, 
special offers and direct mailings that tout new programming and technology, 
including fiberoptic transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
With about 70% of San Diego County homes accessible to cable now receiving the 
service, San Diego is commonly referred to in the industry as the most "wired" 
cable TV market in the country. The county's penetration is far above the 56% 
penetration of households nationwide, said Robert McRann, vice president and 
general manager of Cox Cable San Diego, which is the county's largest provider 
with 305,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
The housing and population booms that the county has experienced over the last 
six years have produced tremendous surge in demand for cable TV hook-ups. That 
demand curve has meant that local cable companies have been able to replace 
disconnects easily with orders from new residents. 
</P>
<P>
Cox and three other companies -- Southwestern Cable TV of San Diego with 
130,000 subscribers, Dimension Cable of Vista with 112,000 households and 
Daniels Cablevision in Carlsbad with 44,000 -- together control about 85% of 
the county's cable TV subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing of the four is Dimension Cable in Vista, which has the 
cable TV franchise for several fast-growing North County municipalities. 
Dimension has increased its subscriber rolls from 98,000 households since the 
end of last year, a 19% annual growth rate. Southwestern Cable will grow by 
about 11% this year, Daniels by 10% and Cox by between 3.5% and 5.5%, the 
companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
(Conventional wisdom seems to have it that San Diego's high cable TV 
penetration is because of high demographics and a good local economy. McRann 
said it is more a result of the generally poor quality of network broadcast 
transmission. The county's rugged topography lacks a central vantage point from 
which signals can be beamed without topographical interruption. "Affluence has 
nothing to do with it," he said.) 
</P>
<P>
But industry observers say growth is due to level off because the supply of new 
housing is being cut by the slow-growth initiatives passed by local 
municipalities in recent years. The fact that many corners of the county are 
already fully "wired" means cable companies can't grow as easily as in the past 
from simple market penetration. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, cable companies are paying much more attention to keeping their existing 
customers content and avoiding subscriber "churn." 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Cable, the cable company that provides service to city of San 
Diego residents north of Interstate 8, added two channels over the past year, 
Turner Network Television (TNT) and Prime Ticket, as a direct result of viewer 
preference polling, spokeswoman Sandra Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
TNT offers mainly sports and movie selections from Ted Turner's 4,000-title MGM 
film library and Prime Ticket is a Southern California regional sports network. 
</P>
<P>
McRann said TNT, which recently was added to Cox's menu of channels as well, is 
the most successful new cable channel "launch" in history, having signed up 
cable systems with 32 million subscribers nationwide in the year since it was 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Dimension and Cox are also touting their fiberoptics lines that have been 
installed in certain segments of their transmission lines. The new technology 
improves reception and increases the lines' transmission capacity, a Dimension 
spokeswoman said. CHRIS KRAUL

ART BUCHWALD: BLUEBIRD OF HAPPINESS FLIES PAST TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first victim in the war of the sexes is truth -- or at least the truth as 
we know it. One of the arguments that wives constantly use against their 
husbands is, "If I don't tell you the truth, who will?" 
</P>
<P>
The only sensible response to that is, "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
I was witness to such a discussion on the beach the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Allen said to her husband, Paul: "Your problem is that nobody tells you 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with that?" Paul asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that you think you can get away with murder. I'm the only one who 
levels with you." 
</P>
<P>
Paul wanted to know, "Who anointed you the 'Goddess of Truth'?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's what wives are for," Susan said indignantly. "We have to see you as you 
really are -- warts and all." 
</P>
<P>
Paul protested: "Men don't want the truth -- ever, and they certainly don't 
wish to hear it from their wives." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose you expect us to behave like cheerleaders." 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly. We want you to swing your pompons back and forth, kick your legs and 
spell out H-U-S-B-A-N-D in the middle of Yankee Stadium. Is that asking too 
much from someone who provides you with extravagantly beautiful towels from 
Macy's?" 
</P>
<P>
"Every male has to have one honest person in his life to tell him when he has 
no clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe so, but it shouldn't be the person he's married to. The trouble with 
wives is that they don't just tell husbands about one thing that's wrong with 
them -- they tell them about everything. It's a litany of boo-boos -- from 
forgetting to put gas in the car, to mixing up the names of the new Polish 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is when you correct me in front of other people, rather than 
when we're alone. This is not something for a woman to do while searching for 
the bluebird of happiness." 
</P>
<P>
Susan said: "The fact that you won't take my criticism means that you won't 
accept criticism from anybody." 
</P>
<P>
"There," yelled Paul, "you're doing it again. You're criticizing me for being 
unable to take criticism." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing anything of the kind. I am just making a statement of fact. If 
there was anything wrong with me, I would expect you to call my attention to 
it. That's what marriage is all about." 
</P>
<P>
"Marriage is not about that at all. Show me the license that allows you to tell 
me when I am making a fool of myself in public." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a license but, as your wife, I have been given the right to let 
it all hang out. I know husbands who would kill to know when they use the wrong 
fork at a dinner party." 
</P>
<P>
"This may surprise you, but I didn't want to hear that. Neither did I wish to 
know the correct way to hang up my pants when I lost money on the stock market. 
You think I like to know the truth about myself, but you have to believe me 
when I say that it's not something I yearn for." 
</P>
<P>
"A wife can't get close to her husband unless she tells him what he's doing 
wrong, even if it's just in conversation." 
</P>
<P>
"There," screamed Paul, pounding his head, "you're doing it again."

<TEXT>
<P>
This city may boast one of the world's finest and most famous orchestras. But 
it is also home to an opera company. Ranked 10th in size among American 
companies, Cleveland Opera is not famous and decidedly not adventurous, relying 
mainly on old-fashioned productions of old-fashioned operas and Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Tuesday night, the company finally had its moment of stardom. It gave the 
premiere performance of a new opera by a rock star, the first new opera by a 
pop celebrity, we are told, since "Porgy and Bess." 
</P>
<P>
The opera is "Holy Blood and Crescent Moon." The rock star is Stewart Copeland, 
former drummer of the band, Police. The staging is lavish, cost a million 
dollars and looks a lot like an extension of Cleveland Opera's State Theater, a 
renovated movie palace. And the result turns out to be an old-fashioned 
production of an old-fashioned opera. Where, you might ask, is the Sting? 
</P>
<P>
Copeland had been commissioned four years ago to write an opera in the hope 
that he might bring something new to the medium. It hadn't mattered that the 
drummer had never heard an opera when he began, or that he lacked basic 
compositional technique. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently also doesn't matter that he still mispronounces viola and 
considers the differences between instruments of the same family to be fine 
distinctions. He has a computer that can remember, manipulate and make notes of 
what he plays. He has a synthesizer that demonstrates the instrumental sounds. 
And that has been good enough for him to produce a ballet score and film along 
with television background music. 
</P>
<P>
It was not, however, good enough for opera. In fact, what Copeland has done has 
been to produce some more background music, this time operatic. Some of it is 
admittedly engaging, especially when it is rhythm driven, as in the 
swashbuckling battle scenes. But Copeland seems determined not to rely upon his 
strengths as a pop musician, and most of "Holy Blood and Crescent Moon" comes 
dangerously close to grand opera parody. 
</P>
<P>
Set to a stilted libretto by British playwright Susan Shirwen, "Holy Blood" is 
a contrived but potentially explosive drama examining Middle East tensions, 
paralleling the religious fervor during the Crusades with current situations. 
Shirwen's characters include a temperate and cultivated Palestinian ruler, a 
somewhat reasonable Christian king, a prince who is believed by a controversial 
sect to be the descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. But all voices of 
moderation are stilled by warlike religious fanatics on both sides, while the 
prince is torn between attraction for the Grand Wazir's steamy daughter and the 
Christian king's vapid one. 
</P>
<P>
To bring this to life, Copeland produces fast squiggles (the composer's own 
term) for the fast parts and lush strings for the slow ones, just as he would 
for the movies. He gives the Muslims vaguely sinuous Oriental squiggles and the 
Christians more forthright ones. The singers sing just like in real opera, only 
they sing a sort of formless arioso over the orchestral squiggles. The choral 
writing is simplistic, with few attempts at real counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
With Cleveland Opera General Manager David Bamberger's hokey production putting 
the stultifying final touches on the work, little could be expected from 
singers given such slight musical or theatrical oppportunity for character 
development, while dressed as if for a '50s B movie. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jon Garrison, as Prince Edmund, contributed a useful bright tenor; 
Edward Crafts made a reasonably commanding Grand Wazir, and Gloria Parker was 
his passionate daughter. A strange touch was entrusting the ayatollah-like Imam 
to a raucous countertenor, that of Tom Emlyn Williams. The rest of the large 
cast pretty much blended in with the fancy woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
In the pit, Imre Pallo did little to make the many awkward transitions sound 
convincing, but the chorus, given pallid unchallenging part-writing, was just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a flash of excitement at the end, when Copeland took his 
bow. Triumphantly running onstage, he jumped all over the place, with his fist 
in the air, at long last demonstrating the excitable rocker roots that his 
music had worked so pitifully hard for three hours to deny.

FORSYTH, SAYLES, REYNOLDS TEAM IN 'BREAKING IN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pairing of director Bill Forsyth and John Sayles, this time as a 
screenwriter, to create the delightful "Breaking In" (opening Friday at 
selected theaters) seems so felicitous you wonder that it didn't happen sooner. 
These are both men who know when to leave well-enough alone and when the 
smallest grace note will set a scene tingling. 
</P>
<P>
The same might be said for Burt Reynolds and Casey Siemaszko, whose pairing as 
the steady old hand and the decidedly shaky new one sets the precise tone for 
this smart, affectionate comedy about chemistry and larceny. 
</P>
<P>
Dapper Ernie (Reynolds), a man for whom the action-back golf shirt was 
invented, is careful about his appearance, his habits and the impression he 
leaves behind. With his very slight limp and his handsome silver hair and 
mustache, he might be a Portland high school principal, although his business 
card says "Ernest Mullins, Sculptor." What's it supposed to say: "Ernest 
Mullins, Safecracker"? 
</P>
<P>
Ringleted Mike (Siemaszko), the goof-off at Bob's Tire and Body Shop, is half 
bouncing ball, half Labrador puppy. You'd swear his tongue was hanging out as 
he panted; the only thing Mike is likely to leave behind is a banana peel, with 
predictable results. Ernie calls him a wacko and Ernie is rarely ever wrong. 
</P>
<P>
They are both set to become partners in the serious business of safecracking. 
With the care that he would use to case a job, Ernie sizes up the goofy Mike 
and thinks just maybe there's the making of a working relationship there, since 
he has recently lost his longtime partner, Red. For his part, once he really 
believes that Ernie's true calling is as a master of "grease" (i.e., 
nitroglycerin), Mike is giddy with the prospect. You half expect him to get 
cards printed too, but you shudder to think what they'd say. 
</P>
<P>
"Breaking In" is decidedly minor-key, done on the notes between the solid, 
expected chords. Like everything Forsyth has put his hand to, but especially 
"Local Hero" and "Comfort and Joy," the humor as well as the character 
development is cumulative. Forsyth is in no hurry to crank up the voltage; he's 
assured enough to let the observations pile up until the audience does his work 
for him, chortling when they can foresee a reaction because they understand the 
characters so well. 
</P>
<P>
And Sayles has given him gorgeous characters. Ernie's two poker cronies, for 
example: Shoes (Harry Carey, who has at last abandoned the Jr. at the end of 
his name) and Johnny Scat (Albert Salmi), who set their considerable experience 
to coming up with the right moniker for Mike. The Artichoke Kid would be a 
natural, given Mike's home town of Castroville, but there was an Artichoke Kid, 
so of course that would be disrespectful. The Tire and Body Shop does it: Mike 
is hereafter the Firestone Kid, and he's as pleased as a general who's gotten 
his fourth star to be so called. (The payoff on this little gag is delayed and 
de-lovely.) 
</P>
<P>
There are also the ladies whom Ernie brings into their relatively sedate lives. 
You and I and your smart 10-year-old know these are ladies of the evening. Mike 
thinks that big-eyed Carrie (Sheila Kelley) has a thing for him. What he makes 
of Delphine (Lorraine Toussaint), Ernie's statuesque regular, the good Lord 
alone can fathom. 
</P>
<P>
But even after Mike learns the truth, that Carrie is neither an actress nor a 
musician -- the impression he got when she explained gravely that her acting is 
"Not at performance level yet -- I'm still developing my instrument" -- he 
finds her irresistible. That's pretty much our reaction too, since Kelley (seen 
so far as the artistic one of the three beautiful young sisters in "Some 
Girls") seems not to be troubled that the warmhearted hooker is the oldest role 
playable, and chooses to make it divinely hers. As Carrie, Kelley is earnest, 
impulsive, dizzyingly eager to please and deliriously funny. And she may 
certainly be in demand for poetry readings, if her delivery of Carrie's ode 
"What Would I Do?" is any indication. (It and other language and mores are the 
reason for the film's R rating.) 
</P>
<P>
Forsyth must have finished the film with callouses from reining Reynolds in 
instead of pushing him down the path of broad reactions and least resistance 
that far too many directors have encouraged in recent years. And both actor and 
director should be elated at the result. It is a superb job, the equal to 
Ernie's deftness with the "grease," not an ounce wasted, not an excess motion, 
with the most satisfying pop to cap things off. To hear Reynolds' comic timing 
when it's being calibrated to a minisecond is an absolute joy, and there are 
more than one of those moments lurking here. 
</P>
<P>
Siemaszko, whose forte is unpredictability and a certain irrepressible energy 
(and whose name is pronounced Sheh-mash-ko), gives absolutely full measure as 
Reynold's sparring partner. Besides, there's always the danger that Mike will 
be a little more of the wacko than even Ernie expects. It gives this 
luxuriously civilized movie its edge.

A DEVILISH EGG SALAD A LA FABERGE; 
</P>
<P>
S.D. GALLERY COOKS UP IRREVERENT COMPANION TO SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Someone had to do it. The pomp and heavy hype embellishing the upcoming show of 
Faberge eggs was ripe for a satirical swipe. Few in San Diego were as fit and 
willing to do it as James Dean Healy, proprietor of downtown's Tohubohu 
Studio/Gallery and self-professed renegade of the local art scene. 
</P>
<P>
Healy put out a call for contributions to the show, "Fabulous Egg Salad," and 
eggs began rolling in from as far as Los Angeles and Arizona. Nearly 50 of the 
artist-designed ovoids will be on view starting Oct. 19, just days before the 
kick-off of the city-sponsored San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
As the centerpiece of the festival, the precious Faberge Imperial eggs promise 
to send a constant hum of "oohs" and "aahs" through the galleries of the San 
Diego Museum of Art. Meanwhile, their irreverent cousins at Tohubohu will 
prompt plenty of giggles and guffaws. The eggs range from the humorous to the 
political, said Healy, citing the "Steve Garvey Egg," its bases loaded with 
women, and the "Maureen O'Connor Egg." Healy will serve -- what else? -- 
deviled eggs at the show's opening reception. 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous Egg Salad" is the most frivolous of the many fringe events running 
concurrently with the San Diego Arts Festival. Other gallery shows may lack the 
levity of Healy's spoof, but they will add their own brand of vitality to the 
festival by presenting a variety of contemporary and historic Soviet art. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious of the independent shows will introduce "unofficial" 
contemporary Soviet art to San Diego. "Contemporary Art from Leningrad: The 
Fellowship for Experimental Art" will contain more than 50 paintings by artists 
working outside of the Artists Union. Without membership in the union, Soviet 
artists are denied the privileges of studio space, ready art supplies and 
exhibition opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"The work is very colorful, bold and expressionistic," said gallery owner David 
Zapf, who co-curated the show with Kathleen Stoughton, director of the Mesa 
College Art Gallery. "All of the paintings seem to have some underlying irony 
or political connotation." The show, consisting of cityscapes, nudes, genre 
scenes and other figurative works, will be divided between the David Zapf 
Gallery and the Mesa College Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The Fellowship for Experimental Art "has used the inadequacies of the current 
rules of culture policy in its own favor," according to a member of the 
Fellowship's council. Artists Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid found these 
rules insurmountable and left their native Russia for Israel in 1977, moving to 
the United States the next year. Working as a team since the early '70s, Komar 
and Melamid were kicked out of the Moscow Union of Artists for "distortion of 
Soviet reality and deviation from the principles of socialist realism." 
</P>
<P>
"They were some of the leading contemporary artists in Russia before they 
left," said Gerry McAllister, director of UC San Diego's Mandeville Gallery. 
During the San Diego Arts Festival, the gallery will show 23 of Komar and 
Melamid's conceptual, autobiographical works, including paintings and mixed 
media works from their recent series on New Jersey's "Bergen Point Brass 
Foundry." The artists will make their first visit to southern California to 
deliver a lecture in conjunction with the show. 
</P>
<P>
The Photowest/W. Bradley Lemery Gallery will cast a glance backward in time 
with the show, "USSR in Construction," featuring experimental photographic and 
typographic montages from the 1930s, many of them published in the monthly, 
"SSSR Na Stroykie." Featured artists include Alexander Rodchenko, who regarded 
the artist as a "constructive" force in the design of post-revolutionary Soviet 
society, and El Lissitsky, who taught constructivist principles of art at the 
famed Bauhaus school in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In a curious twist on the festival theme, the Acevedo Gallery will present 
"Russian Icons by American Artists," with works by Nathaniel Hauser and Robert 
Lentz. Hauser, 
</P>
<P>
affiliated with a Benedictine monastery in Oceanside, paints religious subjects 
using the traditional media of egg tempera and gold leaf. Lentz, an American of 
Russian descent, paints 20th-Century heroes and martyrs, such as Martin Luther 
King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi and Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. His icons 
"celebrate the uncanonized modern-day saint," according to the gallery.

Choreographer Alvin Ailey has resigned his $80,000-a-year professorship at City 
University of New York following complaints that he paid others to teach his 
classes. Professors and former dance students at CUNY told the New York Post 
that Ailey paid other students from his Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater 
Company to teach his ballet and modern-dance courses. Distinguished professors 
at CUNY must spend some time teaching and the university forbids the use of 
surrogates, the newspaper said. ALEENE MacMINN

FOSTER AND DONOHOE IN OPENER OF PACIFIC SYMPHONY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was opening night for the Pacific Symphony, and it sounded like it. That is, 
it sounded as if the orchestra hadn't played together for a while, hadn't sat 
in Segerstrom Hall of the Orange County Performing Arts Center all summer, 
hadn't had time to adjust to this week's guest conductor. All in all, it was an 
inauspicious beginning to the orchestra's 11th season. 
</P>
<P>
Kazimierz Kord, the orchestra's musical adviser and principal guest conductor, 
was not on hand for the opening festivities Tuesday. Lawrence Foster, former 
assistant conductor with the Los Angles Philharmonic and now music director of 
the Monte Carlo Philharmonic, held the podium on this occasion. He is the first 
of seven guest conductors this season, as the orchestra continues searching for 
a permanent music director. It's an ensemble in a transitional stage, which 
certainly goes a long way in explaining Tuesday's unsettled results. 
</P>
<P>
British pianist Peter Donohoe served as the evening's soloist in Bartok's Piano 
Concerto No. 1. If ever there was a concerto to test an orchestra's mettle, 
this is it. The complex sonorities, the driving and shifting meter and the 
complicated interplay between soloist and ensemble tax even the greatest of 
orchestras. This one wasn't yet ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, orchestra and soloist never quite got together. Donohoe 
leaped into his part with neat, energetic efficiency; the orchestra lagged 
behind. Foster beat out the rapidly changing meter clearly but his players 
turned the corners with labored effort. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the slow movement, with its steadily repeated thump, thump, thump, the 
ensemble didn't gel. The music plodded along aimlessly. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. The unevenness of the hall's acoustic, its clear highs and 
muffled bass, made balances an ongoing problem. The percussion, placed 
immediately surrounding the soloist, obscured orchestral detail. The brass 
section could have been in another county: Its sound did not project forward. 
Donohoe gave a propulsive, clean account of the solo, but this concerto does 
not live by piano alone. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission things went a little better for Schubert's Symphony No. 9 in 
C. Here the strings made a solid contribution, with precise execution and lean 
tone. Foster was most convincing in the Andante second movement, where the 
steady clockwork of his tempo, the intimate details in small-scaled passages 
and a warm unhurried lyricism worked its charm. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, his interpretation proved more neat than noble, interesting 
rather than inspired. Woodwind solos generally lacked sparkle and the brass 
were, again, recessed. Schubert's Ninth has been known to have greater effect. 
</P>
<P>
The concert began with a stately, well-played account of "The Moldau" by 
Smetana. TIMOTHY MANGAN

Paramount Pictures has a stake in the upcoming Broadway musical "The Grand 
Hotel," due to open Nov. 12 at the Martin Beck Theater. Paramount, which is 
co-producing the show with Martin Richards and Mary Lea Johnson of the Producer 
Circle, views the endeavor as "an opportunity . . . to further nourish a vital 
American art form, the musical theater." Last season, Paramount co-financed the 
Broadway play "Shirley Valentine," for which Pauline Collins won the Tony Award 
as best actress and in which she stars in the current Paramount film version.

Hold the organ music: Friday the 13th has apparently exacted its curse on 
Valentina Vitale and Anthony Nunzio, the title characters of "Tony n' Tina's 
Wedding." The producers of the environmental theater piece that re-creates an 
Italian-American wedding celebration have canceled this Friday's press 
performance. The reason: anticipated noise interference from a Rip magazine 
party-concert (featuring Faster Pussycat, Wolfsbane, Phantom Blue, Love Hate, 
Johnny Krash, Mimes) that will be going on in a room directly above a ballroom 
at the Park Plaza Hotel, where the mock wedding is staged. ALEENE MacMINN

You don't have to hail from the heartland to hate heartland rock, but it helps. 
It's gotten so it's hard for a Midwestern boy to enjoy the simple pleasures of 
a small-town gas station or a desert sunset without having the scenery spoiled 
by all the myth-making perpetrated on the landscape by the Men Who Would Be 
Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
The BoDeans indulge in their share of that, and can slip into melodramatic 
cliche, but their fun, casual intelligence makes them refrain from turning 
real-life three-minute songs into rootsy rock operettas. 
</P>
<P>
At the Whisky on Tuesday, the hard-working Milwaukee group once again proved 
not only tolerable for the genre but terrific, even while further reinforcing 
their move away from likable, loping country touches toward a rock-radio-ready, 
anthemic style. They sang of lost love and parched land with none of the 
self-seriousness of a Mellencamp. With these guys, you would willingly visit 
the land of drought and hard drink. 
</P>
<P>
The credits for their third album, "Home," indicate that it was cut "live" in 
the studio. You can figure then that in concert you're due for something at 
least as good, which in this case is pretty good indeed. In addition to old 
favorites, the 105-minute set included all of the songs from the current LP 
(plus one of the CD bonus tracks), from the Springstone-age rave-up "Good Work" 
to the accordion-accompanied waltz "Beaujolais." 
</P>
<P>
Dueling lead singers Sam Llanas (once described by Robbie Robertson as sounding 
like an old woman -- but a soulful old woman, mind you) and Kurt Neumann 
actually both sounded less ravaged than they do on the album, where they were 
probably trying to sound ravaged. By the time their voices soared together on 
the closing refrain of "You don't get much without giving," they had put their 
money where their mouths were. CHRIS WILLMAN

SPECIAL SCREENING: THE CLIOS: MASTERPIECES IN THE ART OF SELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes a TV commercial will pass into the vernacular (remember "Where's the 
beef?"?), but most of the time its appearance is a swift cue for us to do 
something -- anything -- other than watch television. The Clios -- the awards 
that honor the best commercials each year -- were concocted nearly 30 years ago 
to prove that there is indeed an aesthetic to all things, and to give heart to 
those people who work in the dubious profession of butting in. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 awards were announced in New York over the summer, but the public will 
get to see the winners in a screening at 8 tonight at the Wilshire Ebell. Since 
they were culled from nearly 27,000 entries, you could expect that virtually 
all these ads have something to recommend them, whether it's humor, pizazz, 
beauty, spectacle, or a surprisingly effective and even profound social 
concern. The worst you could say about any of them is that they're short. 
</P>
<P>
Taking this batch as a representative sample, tots and pets appear to rank 
highest as ideal pitchmen -- who could resent them for being too cute? There's 
less sex here than you'd expect from an industry that uses hunks and bathing 
beauties to shill almost anything, though in a couple of instances a sexual 
theme serves an inadvertently cynical end, as when that soignee Revlon model 
brushes aside every male-on-the-make cliche to tell us: "Never take men like 
this seriously, but by all means take them"; or when that young stud in Levis 
virtually abducts a willing teen-age girl from under the nose of her fuming 
father, who's left stranded in the desert. Thanks, guy. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a funny Seagram's Wine Cooler ad in which a young woman runs 
a whole love-and-marriage fantasy through her mind over the sight of an 
unassuming stranger at the other end of a bar, and then berates him when the 
marriage sours (he, of course, has no idea what she's indignant about, or 
what's behind her lament: "Relationships are so complicated"). 
</P>
<P>
And you have to feel for the exquisite anguish of that hotel room-service 
waiter who delivers breakfast to two lissome women dressed only in bras and 
panties: Gazing discreetly down as he uncovers their tray, his eyes fall 
painfully on the sight of two hard-boiled eggs. The ad, for bras, was made in 
France. The French haven't lost their touch. 
</P>
<P>
Though humor is the device used most frequently to get a point across, the 
strength of a number of these ads is in how gorgeous they are to look at, 
whether in the deliquescent way the camera caresses the contours and surfaces 
of a BMW, or in how darkly lush and shimmering Ireland looks in a tourist ad -- 
you can almost smell the fecundity of its landscapes as they softly unfold 
before the eye. Whitney Huston has just the right buoyancy and vocal panache to 
offset the elaborate techno-pop atmosphere of her Diet Coke spots. And the 
angelic purity of those boys' choral voices in Kodak's "True Colors" ad is 
every bit as touching now as they were when we first heard them during the 
Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Even while we can appreciate the dexterity, technical assurance and 
innovativeness of a lot of these ads, it's a little grim to realize to what 
degree we're forever being caught up in these swift rites of manipulation, and 
how inescapable and ubiquitous is the sales pitch in the modern world. To sit 
through a program dedicated purely to commercials is to feel a perverse 
satisfaction: This is what television is about; this is what television does 
best. These ads are a kind of TV haiku where the medium is indeed the message 
and the message is always about sales. 
</P>
<P>
There is the occasional startling exception, here expressed in the public 
service ad. A Marlboro-Man type out on the range lights up a cigarette and 
doubles over in a coughing jag; the sardonic narrative says, "No wonder the 
cowboy is a dying breed." In a Third World Charity spot, a towheaded British 
lad descends into a public lavatory and drinks out of a filthy toilet bowl. The 
narrator intones, "Five million children die in the Third World from drinking 
water polluted with feces. . . . If you don't mind little black children 
drinking out of a toilet, you won't mind little white children drinking out of 
a toilet either. Or is there a difference?" 
</P>
<P>
The subtlety and visceral power of this ad shows us that we can question the 
aims of some if not most commercials, but not their power to coerce.

CRUDE PLOT SHIFTS BUT NICE CARS ON 'CAMPION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public television launches a new "Mystery!" season tonight, but the results are 
mixed, even for die-hard fans of British crime fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The mild-mannered snooping of blue-nosed detective Albert Campion, played with 
twitty charm by English actor Peter Davison, is fetching, and the British 1930s 
countryside setting is a cozy respite from urban crime zones. But the opening 
two-parter, "Campion: A Case of the Late Pig" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28 and 
15, with the concluding episode airing next Thursday) is meandering to the 
point of distraction. 
</P>
<P>
The plot twists are stagy, even crude. More interesting are the nifty 
roadsters, the manors, the tweeds, the evening wear (people dress for dinner) 
and the geranium urns. One of those pots is a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The show anticipates a series in which style and tone seem far superior to 
content. Having never read a Margery Allingham thriller, four of which were 
adapted into "Mystery's" eight weekly installments (two episodes to a story), I 
can't guage what justice or injustice was done to the late British novelist. 
But the debuting two episodes squander their modest pearls on a script (by Jill 
Hyem) leaden with red herrings. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking the killer of an unbeloved, old school chum aptly known as Pig, 
Davison's Campion cuts a Clark Kent-like figure with his round eye glasses and 
his awkward sex appeal. 
</P>
<P>
An actress with the melodic name of Dilys Laye delivers a bouquet of a 
performance as a frilly hostess of chirpy sophistication; in fact, she almost 
steals the hour. Brian Glover is the hero's pugnacious valet. 
</P>
<P>
During the hokey capture of the murderer and the protagonist's unabashed 
explanation of the plot convolutions (concluding the second episode next week), 
director Robert Chetwyn loses his grip entirely. Even Hitchcock could not have 
salvaged this amateur ending.

EXHIBITS GET TO THE ROOTS OF GEOMETRIC ABSTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUVAN GEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geometric Abstraction gets some of its American roots exposed and its 
contemporary vitality examined in two worthwhile downtown exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"Progressive Geometric Abstraction in America, 1934-55," a highly specific 
selection of works from Southern California physician Peter B. Fischer's 
collection, is being presented at the USC Fisher Gallery through Oct. 28. And 
"Grand Tour, Italian Geo-Romantic" is at Otis/Parsons Gallery through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the formative years of American Abstraction, the Fisher Gallery 
exhibit is a tight survey of some of the abstract artists who lived and worked 
in New York in the early decades of this century. A few, like Arshile Gorky, 
Leon Polk Smith and Ad Reinhardt, are well known. But it is largely the 
paintings by less heralded artists that illuminate and spark interest here. 
</P>
<P>
Charmion Von Wiegand's brightly amusing "Individual Worlds" is a delightful 
primary-colored pipe dream filled with traffic signs and international symbols 
that pitches art as non-verbal communication. There are a couple of masterful 
untitled oils by collector and scholar Albert Gallatin and an exquisite 
iridescent free fall in deep space called "Lyrical 7" by John Sennhauser. 
</P>
<P>
The collection favors totally non-objective, hard-edged, linear abstraction. A 
few biomorphic forms, abstracted landscapes, still-lifes and portraits soften 
the analytical edges of what is at heart a purist's vision of even more 
idealistic art. Overall, the quality of the paintings is remarkably high. These 
43 artists may not be the most original or memorable from the '30s and '40s, 
but these paintings nevertheless clearly resonate with the intellectual vigor 
and conceptual rigors that launched American Modernist painting. 
</P>
<P>
The Fischer collection shows how indebted American Modernism was to the 
influence of European Cubism and Constructivism. Yet it is surprising how vital 
some of those images remain within today's art-about-art discussion of image 
making. That the discussion still rages internationally is the point made at 
Otis/Parsons' "Grand Tour, Italian Geo-Romantic" exhibit. You'll have to rush 
to catch this one before it moves to Milan, but the energy of the assembled art 
is worth the hustle. 
</P>
<P>
The nine artists in this "tour," organized by critic and writer Maria Grazia 
Torri, are Italian. Their art gives the rational formalism of Modernism healthy 
humanity. For all their earnestness, Bruno Sacchetto's paintings of massed, 
machine-hive numbers have the easy-to-take blunt appeal of a comic book. 
Giovanni Sgarbossa's flat-out decorative paintings that parody ornament as 
Florentine geometric design take the clinical sting out of abstraction. And 
what Satprakash does to architectural pillars by playfully covering the rigid 
geometry with Naugahyde-buttoned upholstery spoofs formalism with colloquial 
vernacular. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the art takes such a whimsical attitude to the traditions of Modernism 
or approaches it with this kind of inventive flair. Marco Lavagetto's folding 
box paintings and Piera Legnaghi's curls of painted iron seem curiously bland 
and dated. By contrast, Giancarlo Neri, Giovanni Albertini and Stefano 
Giovanazzi make exacting, idealistic paintings that manage to pump contemporary 
musings into old angular symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Tour" makes a clear point that geometric art isn't simply a moribund 
footnote in the art-history books. It is a living symbolic language. When the 
art, like the high-tech, pseudo-fishing lures of assemblage artist Carlo 
Marzuttini, can bait us with ideas and images we find intriguing, we're hooked 
-- and glad to be.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: BACTERIA-BORNE LISTERIOSIS POSES GREATEST THREAT TO 
YOUNG AND ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-August, millions of Americans in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West 
Virginia were advised to return a particular brand of ham salad. The salad had 
been distributed not only to grocery stores, but to restaurants and 
institutions as well. Not a single person had fallen ill from eating the dish. 
So what was all the fuss about? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that tests had shown that the salad contained a bacteria called 
Listeria monocytogenes. If the name sounds familiar, it may be because it 
gained far wider attention in 1985, when a Mexican-style cheese in Southern 
California was linked to 142 cases, 78 of them fatal. A key point about 
Listeria bacteria is that while most of us can get rid of these microscopic 
creatures without ill effect, for certain other individuals they may pose a 
deadly threat. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the word from the USDA press release, advising the August recall: 
"Consumption of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause 
listeriosis, a rare but potentially fatal disease. In general, healthy people 
are at little risk from listeriosis; most vulnerable are those with weakened 
immune systems -- infants, pregnant women, the elderly and the chronically ill. 
Listeriosis is usually manifested as meningitis or meningoencephalitis, which 
affects tissues around the brain or spine, or septicemia, which is blood 
poisoning. Listeriosis can cause spontaneous abortions and stillbirths." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unidentified Infections 
</P>
<P>
The mixed tones of reassurance and gravity in the message reflect the 
difficulties in understanding how to control the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Listeriosis is not common, although it's true that significant numbers of 
infections -- especially sporadic cases -- probably go unidentified. It is 
believed that there are 1,700 serious cases annually, and that it contributes 
to approximately 450 deaths and 100 stillbirths a year. Unfortunately, 
developing measures to prevent illness presents a formidable challenge to food 
manufacturers and government agencies charged with protecting the safety of the 
food supply. A major problem is that unlike many harmful bacteria, this one can 
continue to grow under refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
Listeria is not a new organism, nor are its potentially harmful effects on 
humans newly recognized. That knowledge has been around for over 50 years. What 
is new is that in recent years it has been identified as the organism in 
commercially produced foods consumed without further cooking that is 
responsible for clustered cases of food-borne illness. 
</P>
<P>
Like numerous other microorganisms, it finds homes in many places, including 
dust, soil, water and sewage, and in decaying vegetation such as animal feed 
and silage. It causes illness in sheep and cattle, and has been isolated from 
42 different wild and domestic animals, 17 types of birds, certain crustaceans, 
trout, ticks and flies. It has also been isolated from cucumbers, radishes, 
potatoes and cabbage. One outbreak several years ago was traced to cole slaw. 
It turned out that the farmer had fertilized his cabbage patch with untreated 
sheep manure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varying Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of the illness vary among those at particular risk. Pregnant women may 
display flulike symptoms, with fever, headache and muscle pain. It may also be 
accompanied by lower back pain. The condition in infants who become ill shortly 
after birth is difficult to separate from other types of infection, although 
small tumors may appear on the skin. Infants who fall ill within a few days to 
a few weeks of birth are more likely to have meningitis. Non-pregnant adults 
and children most likely to be attacked include cancer patients, transplant 
recipients, individuals taking medications that suppress their immune systems, 
and the elderly. Definite diagnosis requires isolating the organism from a 
normally sterile site, such as the blood. Antibiotics are used in treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Preventing the disease is no easy task. To start with, it is unclear why some 
people become ill. Studies show that some individuals who have the organism in 
their stools show no symptoms. And since the incubation period may be as long 
as several weeks, it is often difficult to identify the likely source. By the 
time the infection is diagnosed, the suspect food may no longer be available 
for testing. 
</P>
<P>
Programs run both by the Food and Drug Administration and by the USDA to 
monitor foods for the presence of Listeria microorganisms are being upgraded. 
In 1986, the Centers for Disease Control launched an active surveillance 
program in several states aimed at better understanding the infection. By now, 
it has been established as a disease that should be reported to public-health 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
It is also known that while an estimated 5% of milk carries the bacteria, the 
danger is destroyed by pasteurization. Consumers thus can take a first step 
toward reducing risk by avoiding raw milk. And early diagnosis and treatment 
can improve the outcome, especially in pregnant women, who should consult a 
doctor if typical symptoms occur. 
</P>
<P>
Still, more work is needed to bring the problem under complete control. 
Meanwhile, most of us can comfort ourselves with the thought that the threat of 
infection is rare.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: HOW TO AVOID STIRRING UP TROUBLE IN THE MICROWAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy cooking with my microwave, but when a recipe says to 
stir, is it still necessary since the microwave has a turntable? 
</P>
<P>
 -- RENE, Houston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR RENE: If a recipe says to stir, it is very important that you do so even 
though the microwave has a turntable. Stirring usually keeps dishes from 
cooking unevenly on the bottom and around the edges. The turntable has metal 
gears that may block out some of the microwaves and the food might cook 
unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My husband discovered a way to keep the contents of two-liter pop 
bottles from going flat after being opened. Put the cap back on loosely, then 
squeeze the plastic bottle until the remaining liquid comes right up to the 
neck or as close to it as possible. Then, while holding it there, tighten the 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
With practically no air remaining in the bottle, the contents will retain most 
of their original qualities. This works except for the last few ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MAYLO, Glendive, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I read in your column a hint about mixing and preparing frozen 
orange juice by using a potato masher to break down the frozen juice. 
</P>
<P>
I know an easier way. The night before I want to serve the juice, I dump the 
frozen juice out of the can into my plastic container, then add the required 
amount of water. I place the container in the refrigerator and when I take it 
out in the morning, the frozen juice has thawed and I only need to stir or 
shake it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JEAN, Concordia, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My daughter and I had a half-bushel of cherries to be pitted. It 
was taking us forever and I thought there had to be an easier way. A good 
thought came to me -- try a carrot peeler. 
</P>
<P>
I put the end of the peeler through the top of each cherry and pulled the seed 
out. It really saved time and lots of trouble. Wanted to pass this along to 
other cherry pitters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HAZEL, Henderson, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Coffee filters sure are versatile. I use them for so many things. 
</P>
<P>
Our family is watching calories and fat intake, so I steam as many things as I 
can. One of our favorite steamed dishes is fish. The problem is in removing the 
fish, which crumbles into a zillion little pieces. What a mess. 
</P>
<P>
I came up with this. Before placing the fish in the steamer, I place it in a 
coffee filter. When the fish is done I simply lift it out in the filter in one 
piece. It looks more appetizing this way too. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I bought some new smoked glass pie plates, but they look smaller 
than my standard nine-inch pie plates. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to prepare pie filling for a nine-inch pie and find that it won't 
all fit into one of my new plates. How can I test them? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANN, Casper, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ANN: Our home economist suggested the following method: Pour four cups of 
water into the plate. If it holds it, then it is a nine-inch pie plate. A 
nine-inch pie plate should hold four cups of liquid exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I just moved into an apartment and really have a problem with 
insects. Any tips sure will be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CELIA, Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CELIA: One of the most important things to do to keep insects away is to 
regularly clean the areas where they are most commonly found. Usually these 
areas are the kitchen, bathroom, basements or areas that are damp and dark. 
</P>
<P>
To discourage these pests, clean under all appliances and heavy furniture. You 
may want to treat this area with an insecticide to deter any stubborn 
residents. Read all label directions on any insecticide and follow them 
exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget to clean areas like air ducts, cracks, baseboards, floor 
registers, corners and other areas where insects can hide and breed. These 
areas can also be treated with an insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
All foods should be stored properly with tight-fitting lids or they should be 
covered appropriately. When bringing grain products home, place the products in 
the oven at 130 degrees for 30 minutes or place them in the freezer at zero 
degrees for seven days. If the products have weevils, this procedure will keep 
them from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a heavy infestation of unwanted insect tenants, call a professional 
exterminator. This is often the only way to totally rid a home of all unwanted 
pests. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When cooking pasta we all know the trick of using a drop of 
cooking oil in the water to keep the pot from boiling over, but here is another 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Spray a light film of vegetable-oil spray on the inside of the colander before 
you drain the pasta in it. You can now drain the pasta for as long as you want 
and it won't stick to the surface of the colander.

SCALED-DOWN AIRPORT COMPLEX APPROVED 4-3; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL SPENT A CONTENTIOUS FIVE HOURS 
DEBATING THE MERITS OF THE COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL OFFICE PROJECT BEFORE THE 
MAYOR CAST THE DECIDING VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council approved plans for a controversial office complex 
at Santa Monica Airport early Wednesday, despite an hours-long effort by one 
member to defeat the project with a point-by-point challenge of traffic and 
revenue information. Tempers were flaring after midnight when the council voted 
4 to 3 to approve a 822,000-square-foot version of the originally proposed 
Santa Monica Common commercial and retail office complex. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Reliance Development Group, had agreed to accept the scaled-back 
version of the project, and said the smaller version of the project would have 
little or no impact on surrounding areas. Reliance was selected by the city in 
1987 to develop the 37.56 acres of city-owned property at Bundy Drive and 
Airport Avenue, at the southeast corner of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
In reducing the original 1.3-million-square-foot proposal, the council hoped to 
satisfy Reliance, which had threatened to back out if the city cut the project 
to less than 822,000 square feet, and also soothe angry nearby residents, who 
said the sprawling complex would wreak havoc on traffic in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"In my judgment, this project will help this community in a dramatic fashion 
with many of its major concerns," said Mayor Dennis Zane shortly before 
providing the key vote. 
</P>
<P>
Zane argued that money received from the project -- estimated as high as $27 
million over the next 10 years from lease payments and taxes -- could be used 
to bolster sagging social, education, and parks programs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Though several of the council members appeared to have made a decision on the 
fate of Santa Monica Common early in the five-hour hearing, some members posed 
a long series of highly detailed questions to city staff and the developer in 
an effort to sway members against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ken Genser doggedly pursued supporters of the project with inquiries 
into how traffic studies were made, whether the description of the smaller 
project as having "no impact" on surrounding areas was accurate, and whether 
projected revenues from the project were overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the council was nearly forced to adjourn when it was unable to 
pass a motion to extend the meeting beyond 11 p.m. because Genser would not 
agree to halt his questions. Councilman Herbert Katz, who with Mayor Pro 
Tempore David Finkel sided with Genser against the project, objected to 
Genser's persistent questions on minute details, and said he would not vote to 
extend the meeting as required unless questions were halted. Several council 
members accused Genser of conducting a filibuster but they finally were able to 
vote to continue the meeting and end questions. 
</P>
<P>
Though clearly annoyed, Genser stopped his questions after explaining why his 
interrogation had been so exhaustive: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't accept a (project) analysis that says the sky is red when I know it's 
blue. I just think it is very unwise of us to dispose of open space like this 
for a period probably longer than our lifetime," Genser said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision brought to a formal end the fight over what to do with the 
city-owned tract at the airport's southeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, many from Mar Vista and other neighborhoods of Los Angeles, had 
swarmed a series of public hearings before the council and the Santa Monica 
Planning Commission in recent weeks to loudly protest the project. Most 
objections revolved around traffic that would be generated by the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles residents complained that because the development is blocked off 
from the rest of Santa Monica by the airport, all of the traffic from Santa 
Monica Common would pass through their neighborhoods, even though Los Angeles 
would receive none of the financial benefits from the project. Santa Monica 
residents protested that the project would produce traffic jams and 
construction dust, and said the property would better serve the city as a park. 
</P>
<P>
Though public comment on the project had been closed by the council after a 
special hearing Oct. 3, about 30 vocal opponents awaited the council's decision 
with cheers for the no votes and jeers for the ayes. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles resident William Scheding, who jumped up and shouted "coward!" when 
Zane cast the deciding vote, predicted that the decision would come back to 
haunt Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"All the negative effects are in Los Angeles," Scheding said. "All the positive 
effects are in Santa Monica. That's not a good-neighbor policy. . . . I think 
the city of Santa Monica will get burnt by this project in the end." Scheding 
said several lawsuits against the project are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Though an environmental impact report estimated that as many as 12,000 daily 
car trips would flow onto Bundy Drive, both city staff and developer's 
consultants argued that improvements by Santa Monica at a number of 
intersections and the widening of Centinela Avenue south of the airport by the 
city of Los Angeles would reduce the impacts of that traffic to zero. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP The City Council will formally authorize the project with ordinances 
in the next month. Lawsuits to block construction are certain to follow. If 
they are resolved, construction could begin in 1991.

PARENTS AT ALL-GIRL WESTLAKE PROTEST MERGER PLAN WITH ALL-BOY HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of parents of girls attending Westlake School are demanding an 
explanation and a voice in the decision announced last week to merge the 
prestigious girls' school with Harvard School for boys. 
</P>
<P>
Parents circulated petitions at an open house Tuesday night seeking a 90-day 
delay during which parents, students, faculty and alumnae would be consulted 
about the proposed plan to go coed. Nearly 200 parents, representing the three 
junior high classes alone, signed the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Flyers headlined, "Save the Westlake School for Girls," with for girls 
underlined, were plastered on parents' cars, urging parents to attend an 
all-school meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Parents complained that they were presented last week with a fait accompli. 
Many were left with questions about the necessity of the merger and fears that 
their daughters will lose an educational atmosphere that encourages them to 
reach their potential and enhances self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Parents said their first inkling of the merger came when their distressed 
daughters called them from pay phones at school after an assembly at Westlake 
last week. Westlake is located in Holmby Hills, where the seventh, eighth and 
ninth grades will be taught if the schools merge as planned in 1991. The upper 
grades will be taught at Harvard School in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a drastic change in the lives of 700-odd girls and their families and 
no one asks them (their opinion)," said Karen Hill-Scott, a UCLA professor with 
a daughter in the 10th grade. "The absence of communication casts an overall 
negative pallor for many, many parents," she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
David Higgins, as did many other parents, voiced his concerns to Westlake 
Headmaster Nathan Reynolds at the open house. "The underlying objection is the 
haste and the secrecy," said Higgins, who has two daughters at the school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Support Merger 
</P>
<P>
Some parents expressed their support of the merger to Reynolds and suggested 
that they may be a silent majority. But disgruntled parents said they found 
deep dissatisfaction during a telephone tree process to invite parents to 
tonight's meeting. They said their position is: Convince us that this is in the 
best interest of our daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard will dominate the newly formed board of trustees by a 2-1 margin in the 
merger plan. The Harvard headmaster will be in charge and the new school will 
be named Harvard-Westlake, leading Westlake parents to worry that Westlake got 
the short end of the merger. "What did Westlake get out of this?" one parent 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
The composition of the new board was based on diversity, not which school the 
board member came from, Reynolds said. However, he acknowledged that while the 
board members from Harvard had been selected, the Westlake representatives had 
not. 
</P>
<P>
The merger was placed on the agenda of the Westlake Board of Trustees meeting 
last week without warning, said several parents who requested anonymity. The 
parents said that when the 12 or 13 board members present voted on the subject, 
they had not had adequate time to evaluate the data on which the merger was 
based. Three trustees voted against the merger. The plan was presented to the 
board by a subcommittee that had been negotiating with Harvard without telling 
the rest of 23-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds defended the secrecy as necessary for the success of the plan, saying, 
"They would have never gotten as far as they did" if the process was open to 
public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier attempts to merge, one of them six years ago, were stymied by 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said the merger was based on confidential information about the future 
enrollment base for Westlake. The concern was that if Harvard went coed on its 
own, as it was prepared to do, it would siphon off some of the top girls from 
Westlake, turning it into a second-rate school. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year Westlake veteran said it was more important to maintain the quality 
of the student body and faculty than to continue as a girls school. "I'm 
talking about first-rate education for young women and young men," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents said they find such talk ironic in that Reynolds has always sold 
Westlake's all-girl composition as superior to coeducation. At the open house, 
they distributed a reprint of a Wall Street Journal article on research that 
concluded boys receive more attention from teachers, which undermines the 
self-esteem and damages the morale of girls. 
</P>
<P>
They were originally given the article, and others like it, by Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Can Empathize' 
</P>
<P>
Reaction at Harvard School has been more positive, according to Headmaster 
Thomas C. Hudnut, who will run the merged schools. "I can empathize with 
Westlake parents who feel a great sense of loss, but I hope their sense of loss 
will give way to the conviction that we're preparing for a better future." 
</P>
<P>
A coeducational environment is preferable, he said, "because the world out 
there is a coed world." 
</P>
<P>
Hudnut said it was appropriate for the trustees to make the decision to merge. 
"I think trustees who are charged with management of an institution must be 
able to carry on their deliberations confidentially." 
</P>
<P>
Some parents believe that they may be able to block, or at least postpone, the 
merger, which must be voted upon again by the Westlake board. That opinion is 
not shared by the administration. Seventh-grade girls who were circulating 
their own petitions to keep Westlake an all-girls school were advised at an 
assembly that their effort was futile because the matter had been resolved, one 
parent said.

TEACHERS REJECT CULVER CITY PACT; NEW TALKS LIKELY; 
</P>
<P>
NEGOTIATIONS: THE HEFTY PAY RAISE WON BY LOS ANGELES TEACHERS IS MAKING LIFE 
DIFFICULT FOR SURROUNDING DISTRICTS, AND CULVER CITY IS THE LATEST TO SUCCUMB 
TO "L.A. SYNDROME." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The settlement reached by Los Angeles teachers last spring continues to 
reverberate in surrounding school districts, and the latest twang has sounded 
in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City teachers voted 111 to 86 Tuesday to reject a tentative agreement 
with the school district that included a 6% pay raise and new health benefits 
for retirees. The agreement, however, also had higher health insurance 
copayments. 
</P>
<P>
Bess Doerr, president of the Culver City Teachers Assn., said the vote 
indicates that the rank and file "may think there's lots more money than (the 
district) says there is" and "the 8% from L.A. is ringing in their ears." Los 
Angeles teachers, after striking in May, won 8% raises for each of the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said she was not surprised that the agreement was rejected, but she still 
believes that it is "an excellent package." 
</P>
<P>
The no vote does not mean a strike, Doerr said. The union and the school 
district now must return to the bargaining table, and if face-to-face 
negotiations don't work, a state mediator will be called in. At this point, she 
said, "We just start over." 
</P>
<P>
Starting salary for teachers in the Culver City Unified School District is now 
$24,000 and would have risen to $25,440 under the tentative agreement. Top pay 
is now $43,300 for those with 20 years experience and would have risen to 
$45,898 under the rejected agreement. Los Angeles teachers this year start at 
$27,346 and earn a maximum of $50,123 with 20 years experience and a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, the district would have increased its 
contribution by 7% for teachers enrolled in a fee-for-service health plan. But, 
because the cost of such health coverage is rising at a higher rate, a 
teacher's payment for individual coverage would go up from $41 to $57 a month, 
according to Doerr. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would also have adopted a new state provision in which teachers 
can buy into Medicare by paying 1.45% of their salary, which would be matched 
by a district contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the district would also pay $1,250 per year for health 
insurance for future retirees after age 65, to supplement Medicare coverage. 
Retirees who are older than 65 do not have any district health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr and David Mielke, president of the rival Culver City Federation of 
Teachers that was ousted as the bargaining representative in 1988, said the 
ratification vote was not split along political lines. "There were several 
federation people for it, and some CCTA teachers who said they were voting 
against it," Doerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said the union will survey teachers to plan its strategy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union's Dilemma 
</P>
<P>
The health insurance issue in particular, she said, has put the union "between 
a rock and a hard place." Teachers who belong to a health maintenance 
organization and who do not pay any out-of-pocket costs for their coverage want 
higher salaries; those with fee-for-service plans are concerned about 
increasing copayments. 
</P>
<P>
"What (the teachers) probably want is the 8% along with the lifetime benefits," 
Doerr said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said she wasn't sure the district would or could give that. "We'll 
check the books all over again, and see if it's possible there's more." 
</P>
<P>
James Lively, the district's chief financial officer, said the tentative 
agreement would cost about $850,000 for the 280 teachers, counselors, 
librarians and nurses in the district. The district's 250 custodians, 
instructional aides, cafeteria workers and other classified employees, under a 
"me-too" clause in their contract, will get the same percentage salary increase 
and benefits teachers get, bringing the total cost of the package to about $1 
million, Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
The district intends to pay for its salary settlement with reserves, savings 
from employee attrition, cutting purchases of supplies, and getting extra state 
lottery money, Lively said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More Concessions 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that the district does not have more to give. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they got the very best deal. We've given everything we could," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Villani, an assistant superintendent who is in charge of negotiations, 
said the teachers were "responding to the L.A. syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
The school district, he said, is "stretched to the very nth degree" and there 
was "no way we can give everybody what they want." 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said two Culver City teachers have left for the higher salaries in Los 
Angeles this year. One of them, a bilingual teacher, is making $10,000 more 
than she did in Culver City, in part because Los Angeles gives bonuses to 
bilingual teachers and Culver City does not, Doerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Many others are applying and interviewing, Doerr said. "It's difficult for 
Culver City to compete for teachers, but (it is) going to have to." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers federation leader Mielke, who had opposed the tentative agreement, 
said the no-vote was a grass-roots effort that shows that "teachers don't want 
anything else taken out of the contract." 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a vote of no confidence in the negotiating team," he said. He said 
the teachers association partly had itself to blame for the rejection, because 
it was voted in on campaign promises to negotiate for 10% pay hikes and 
lifetime health benefits. "Now the time has come to follow through on those 
promises."

Even the experts are shaken by disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Mory B. Framer has been experiencing mild symptoms of post-traumatic stress 
disorder since he visited South Carolina in the days after Hurricane Hugo. "I'm 
still having images of trees snapped in half," said the Westside psychologist, 
who went to Charleston to teach local counselors and therapists how to deal 
with the emotional aftermath of the devastating storm. 
</P>
<P>
Framer is clinical director of Barrington Psychiatric Center in West Los 
Angeles, whose 26 psychiatrists, psychologists and other therapists specialize 
in treating the victims of natural disasters and other catastrophes. According 
to Framer, at least 90% of the victims of killer storms and other disasters 
experience one or more of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the 
psychological affliction most commonly identified with troubled Vietnam War 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
These symptoms, he said, can include everything from flashbacks, nightmares, 
anger, shame, irritability and emotional numbness to loss of sexual drive and 
cold-like symptoms. Just knowing that such symptoms are a predictable part of 
the disaster experience helps victims recover, Framer said. 
</P>
<P>
Framer said his firm was invited to South Carolina to work with the staff of 
the Medical University of South Carolina. Their job was to help equip 
mental-health workers for the emotional cleanup necessitated by Hurricane Hugo, 
which killed at least 18 people and left an estimated 70,000 homeless and many 
thousands more without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"What was so fascinating was that, due to the enormity and scope of that 
disaster, the people entrusted with mental-health care were suffering the same 
consequences of the disaster as everyone else," Framer said. "We're not 
immune." 
</P>
<P>
Framer said he and his colleagues gave the mental-health workers the advice 
they give all disaster victims. First, they educated them as to what to expect, 
including feelings of being out of control or feelings of guilt at having 
survived. "If you know what to expect, it helps you to normalize the reaction," 
Framer said, adding, "It doesn't take away the pain." 
</P>
<P>
The mental-health workers were told that the healing process would take time 
and not to have heroic expectations for themselves. "People hold themselves to 
an unreasonably high standard," said Raymond J. Friedman, Barrington's medical 
director who was also part of the Charleston team. "People feel that after a 
day or two they should feel much better." 
</P>
<P>
The mental-health workers were urged not to bottle up their feelings and to 
talk about their own reactions to the storm. They couldn't stop doing so. 
Barrington staffer Jan Friedman, who also went to Charleston, noted that the 
closer she got to the storm-ravaged area, the more she heard people talking 
with great sadness about trees, one of the treasures Hugo had destroyed. 
"Everyone was literally mourning the trees," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helpful Tips 
</P>
<P>
The Barrington team advised the mental-health workers to seek additional help 
if their symptoms got worse. They also counseled the counselors to watch their 
diets, get plenty of exercise and to maintain familiar routines. Framer said he 
followed his own advice and kept up his jogging routine while in Charleston, 
despite sneers from passers-by who didn't recognize psychological self-help 
when they saw it. 
</P>
<P>
The study and treatment of traumatic stress is a relatively new field, Framer 
said. His organization advises companies on how to deal with stress after 
workplace accidents or disasters, in part with an eye to containing costs. The 
group is also one of the few that provides post-disaster psychological services 
to communities, usually at no charge, as was the case in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
The center has sent response teams to disasters as diverse as the Whittier 
earthquake, the First Interstate Bank fire and the Stockton schoolyard 
massacre. The group also worked with search and rescue workers after the 1987 
crash of a PSA plane near San Luis Obispo. Other clients include reporters 
haunted by horrifying news stories they have covered. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster, Framer said, "teaches us probably the most painful lesson in life: 
that we are mortal, that we are not Rambo or Superwoman. There are forces out 
there that are more powerful than ourselves." A personal perception of 
powerlessness is one almost universal consequence of experiencing a disaster, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Help 
</P>
<P>
But he and his colleagues have found that the earlier professionals are on the 
scene working with disaster victims, the sooner people regain a sense of 
control. Early intervention reduces the severity of the individual's distress 
and also the ultimate cost of the experience, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the Charleston experience, Framer said he is convinced that 
Angelenos should prepare for the Big One emotionally, as well as physically. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should have a list to put in their little 
earthquake-preparedness kit," he said, referring to the list of emotional 
reactions disaster victims can expect to experience and self-help tips for 
dealing with them. The prepared parent knows, for instance, that a toddler who 
has given up his bedtime blanket may want it back again after a quake. Prepared 
parents will also return as quickly as possible to the telling of bedtime 
stories and other family rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Framer said he has also realized how important it is for disaster victims to 
have access to mental-health professionals who aren't unduly stressed or 
exhausted by the catastrophe. Local mental-health workers should start 
networking now, he advised, so that experts from other parts of the country 
will be poised to move quickly into Southern California in case of need.

GLENDALE WEIGHS COMPETITION TO LAUNCH ARTS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale officials are considering sponsoring an artists' competition to launch 
a cultural renaissance that would bring artworks, festivals and other events to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The competition -- in which artists would be asked to submit ideas for a 
sculpture, painting or other art forms to be displayed in a public place and 
paid for at taxpayer expense -- was among several ideas proposed Monday in the 
second of a two-part workshop on a proposed public arts program. 
</P>
<P>
"Contests bring out the very best," Councilman Larry Zarian said after city 
leaders, artists and developers wrestled for two hours over the idea of 
promoting artistic endeavors in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Raggio said an open competition, inviting participation by 
hundreds of artists in Southern California, "would send out a signal that 
Glendale is interested in art." 
</P>
<P>
Others at the study session took a strictly pragmatic approach to Glendale's 
quest to establish a cultural arts identity. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're really serious about getting art in Glendale, the first thing you've 
got to do is get rid of the pigeons," said Aulden Schlatter, executive vice 
president and general manager of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Schlatter fears that the hundreds of pesky birds that roost on rooftops along 
Brand Boulevard, like their counterparts in other cities, could quickly lay 
claim to any sculptures or other artworks. 
</P>
<P>
While council members apparently agree that the city should have some form of 
arts policy, they seem to disagree on who ultimately will decide what is art. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio said he would like the city to form an arts advisory panel of experts. 
"I don't feel competent to do this by myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said she is skeptical of the idea of an 
arts panel. "We've got to consider a lot of details before we jump in," she 
said, adding that she prefers classical, traditional artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fuller of the ELS Design Group of Berkeley, the city's consultant, said 
he studied art programs in 15 cities and found that "all are quite different. 
Conceptually, the programs are very easy. No one is against art. The problem is 
practicality. Whose piece do you choose?" 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold Milner said that with or without an advisory panel, the 
five-member council ultimately will decide what is art in Glendale. "We are 
making decisions that will affect the quality of life for the next 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Officials have been talking for months about adopting a public arts policy that 
would encourage private- and public-sponsored art forms and events. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this year, the City Council set aside $100,000 in the budget 
to promote an arts program. The workshops, held last week and this week, were 
geared to determine how best to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
A competition was proposed by Glendale artist Ron Pekar, one of a small group 
of artists, architects, developers, consultants and curators who have been 
meeting with council members to help draft a public arts policy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, one or more suggestions from artists could be selected by a 
special panel to receive public funding for creation and display, possibly in 
the public service building to be constructed soon in the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
An arts policy suggested by the city's Redevelopment Agency would require all 
developers in the downtown area to incorporate artworks into their projects or 
to contribute money to a downtown arts fund. The fund could then be used for 
permanent and temporary exhibits; cultural events such as performances, 
festivals and lectures, and cultural facilities, said Jeanne Armstrong, 
redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong called artworks and cultural events "vital elements of a mature, 
urban downtown." However, she recommended that the city enter a program 
gradually by introducing temporary installation of artworks and sponsoring 
special events rather than seeking a permanent, prominent piece that could be 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always a question of using taxpayer money for art," Armstrong said. 
"The community must like it." 
</P>
<P>
City staff members are expected to incorporate council suggestions into a draft 
arts policy to be brought back to the council within a few weeks.

WHITTIER VOTES UNANIMOUSLY TO TEAR DOWN HISTORIC THEATER AS PRESERVATIONISTS 
FIGHT ON 
</P>

<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to demolish the historic 
Whittier Theater, closing the final curtain after two years of emotional public 
debate over whether the city can afford to save the crumbling, Depression-era 
film palace. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge may save the building by refusing to lift an 
injunction that for two years has prevented the city from demolishing the movie 
house. The court will examine a recently completed environmental impact report. 
City officials said the report clearly supports the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago attorneys for the Whittier Conservancy obtained the injunction 
after successfully arguing in court that the city must conduct an environmental 
impact report before razing the theater, which was damaged in the Oct. 1, 1987, 
earthquake and then partially bulldozed by a city wrecking crew. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style theater was built in 1929 at Whittier Boulevard and Hadley 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Whittier Conservancy, the group fighting to save the old 
theater, said the environmental impact study is inadequate because it does not 
explore ways the theater could be rehabilitated. Members said they will try to 
persuade the judge not to lift the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully the judge will recognize that the EIR is incomplete," said Helen 
Rahder, spokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy. "The EIR could have been a 
McDonald's menu and the City Council would not have known the difference." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, Rahder said she believes the theater will be demolished 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply a city policy decision," Rahder said. "The theater is going down 
over our dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
After listening to two hours of heated public testimony from historical 
preservationists, officials said privately that the decision to destroy the 
building was based on one thing: money. To rehabilitate the theater, the city 
would have to heavily subsidize the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to subsidize this project or put the money to some other use?" 
City Attorney James Markman asked the council. "It comes down to public money." 
</P>
<P>
For two years council members have said that they would not subsidize the 
theater, which could cost the city $1.6 million to $3.4 million for acquisition 
and rehabilitation, plus an additional $500,000 annually to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the business of spending a lot of money to restore a badly 
damaged theater," said Councilman Gene Chandler. "We have better places to 
spend our money." 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people -- including historical enthusiasts from Los Angeles, Pasadena, 
Santa Barbara and San Bernardino -- spoke out on the importance of saving the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater could be a jewel in our crown," Peter Holliday, an art and 
architectural history professor at California State University at San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the film palace, designed like the court of a Spanish hacienda, is 
one of a few remaining examples of a once-popular style of theater architecture 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly, it is the kind of theater that some developers are now trying 
to re-establish," Holliday said. "We have a chance to keep what other cities 
are trying to imitate." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to historical value, the theater also has emotional value as well, 
Holliday and several other people told the council. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Whittier and the Whittier Theater is where many of us first saw 
certain movies," Holliday said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents reminisced about the interesting design of the inside of the 
theater. Painted clouds and lights that looked like stars decorated the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"If you got bored with the movie you could always look up at the ceiling," one 
resident told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Kovacic, an attorney for Peter Doerken, the developer who bought the 
theater in June, 1987, for $1.1 million, told the council that the historical 
preservationists are "dreaming" if they think the theater could be restored. 
</P>
<P>
Before the quake Doerken asked the city for permission to demolish the theater 
so he could build a $14-million shopping center on the site. The council was 
considering the issue when the quake occurred. 
</P>
<P>
A deed restriction prohibited Doerken from showing major motion pictures at the 
theater. Therefore, the developer said he would not rehabilitate the movie 
house, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could hit a fast ball like Will Clark and the theater could be 
restored," Kovacic said. "But it's pie in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"History has proven that people come up here and state that the theater must be 
saved, but when it comes to putting the dollar forward, no one is willing to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney will ask a Superior Court judge to review the EIR and lift an 
injunction prohibiting the demolition of the historic theater. If the 
injunction is lifted, a wrecking crew will raze the building. City officials 
said it could take several months for a judge to rule on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MILESTONES IN HISTORY OF WHITTIER THEATER 
</P>
<P>
Summer, 1929 -- Construction was completed on the 982-seat theater, originally 
outside the city limits to prevent the Whittier City Council from censoring 
motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 23, 1986 -- The theater was placed on the local register of historic 
places by the Whittier City Council. 
</P>
<P>
July 1, 1987 -- Sold by Pacific Theaters to Doerken Properties Inc. for $1.1 
million with a deed restriction stating that the property could not be used as 
a motion picture theater. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1987 -- Demolition was scheduled by developer Peter Doerken, who 
said he planned to build a $14-million shopping center on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1, 1987 -- The building was damaged by a major earthquake centered in 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 8, 1987 -- The city issued a notice to demolish the theater because of 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 18, 1987 -- Demolition began, but was halted when a lawyer for the 
Whittier Conservancy obtained a temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 9, 1987 -- A preliminary injunction prohibiting demolition was granted 
until the city could complete an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 10, 1989 -- Environmental report was sent to the City Council, which voted 
to demolish the theater.

CLAWS COME OUT WHEN POMONA TRIES TO CURB CATS 
</P>

How many cats is too many? 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona City Council couldn't agree this week, so Councilwoman Nell Soto -- 
who originally proposed a limit on what she said is an out-of-control cat 
population -- is back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said that in trying to solve the cat problem, 
"we've strayed into an area we should stay out of." 
</P>
<P>
Soto said she suggested a cat limit because of complaints from residents who 
say their neighborhoods are full of felines. Soto originally proposed a 
three-cat-per-household limit, then raised the ceiling to five. 
</P>
<P>
But Ted Krueger, who has seven cats, said owners should keep their cats indoors 
or have them neutered. Establishing a cat limit, he said, "is unfair to pet 
owners who are conscientious and take care of their animals, regardless of the 
number they have." 
</P>
<P>
Another pet owner, Betty Ann Jenkins, said the problem is not the number of 
cats in caring households but the number of strays. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the current stray program, in which residents borrow traps from the 
Pomona Valley Human Society, doesn't work. She said she heard from one man who 
"ordered a trap, but had to take it back because he kept catching skunks and 
possums." 
</P>
<P>
William C. Harford, executive director of the society, which provides animal 
control for La Verne, Diamond Bar, Chino and Montclair as well as Pomona, said 
pet limits are enforced only after a complaint, making restrictions "almost a 
tool for one neighbor to get back at another neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Harford said a limit on the number of pets a family can have is "not the answer 
to the problem" but is a start. He suggested that Pomona might follow 
Claremont, which limits the number of cats over 4 years old but provides a 
process for households with more cats to obtain kennel licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning cat population is a national problem, Harford said. In the year 
ending June 30, Harford said, 4,753 unwanted cats were picked up in Pomona, and 
4,010 had to be destroyed. Although a decade ago, animal control officers 
mainly caught dogs, they are now almost as busy catching cats. Harford said his 
agency handled 13,300 dogs and 12,920 cats last year. 
</P>
<P>
People need to be educated to confine cats or have them neutered, Harford said. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected Soto's proposal 4 to 1. But Soto said she will look into 
another ordinance that would impose a limit but allow families with more cats 
to qualify for licenses to keep them.

BOARD OPTS TO STAY NEUTRAL ON PUPIL SHIFT; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE ARCADIA SCHOOL BOARD HAS DECIDED NOT TO TAKE A STAND ON WHETHER 
SIERRA MADRE STUDENTS SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM PASADENA UNIFIED TO ARCADIA. 
</P>

<P>
Whether Sierra Madre students should be allowed to switch from the Pasadena 
Unified School District to Arcadia Unified will get its first public hearing 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
A final decision isn't expected until the fall of 1990, but at least one of the 
players has already taken a stance, of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Arcadia school board voted to remain neutral, saying its 
school district of 7,500 students could absorb the 632 Sierra Madre students 
who now attend Pasadena public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't to say that at some future time we might not move toward opposition 
or support," said Arcadia board member Joann Steinmeier. "I don't think we have 
enough information to say what the consequences would be." 
</P>
<P>
One variable is how many Sierra Madre students who now attend private schools 
might cross over into Arcadia public schools, if the redistricting drive is 
successful. Those favoring breaking away say that, based on 1988 census 
figures, there are 1,900 school-age children in Sierra Madre. 
</P>
<P>
And, based on an informal parent poll, secession proponents estimated 1,200 
children, counting current public school students and those who would switch 
from private school, might move to the Arcadia system. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia officials say they are skeptical of that figure and need more 
information before they decide whether they favor the switch. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, organized by the Los Angeles County Committee on School 
Reorganization, is the result of a controversial proposal by a group of Sierra 
Madre parents to secede from the 22,000-student Pasadena Unified School 
District and annex Sierra Madre to Arcadia Unified. 
</P>
<P>
Those parents, from mainly white and middle-class Sierra Madre, say they have 
concerns about Pasadena schools, where class enrollment is now 90% minority 
children and students score in the bottom third on standardized reading and 
math tests. 
</P>
<P>
But some members of an opposing parents' group called All Children Count have 
accused the Sierra Madre group of racism and say parental fears are greatly 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Madre Parents for a Better Education, the group that sparked the 
secession drive, denied the allegations of racism. Spokeswoman Susan Lavoe said 
members of her group want what is best for their children. She cited concern 
with eroding test scores in Pasadena schools and rising problems with gangs, 
drugs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
And the Pasadena school district, which with all others receives state funding 
based on the number of students enrolled, is chafing at the possible loss. It 
has authorized $25,000 for an attorney to stave off secession, which it says 
would hurt existing school programs. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say that, even if the secession drive is successful, there 
will not be any changes until July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
After a second public hearing next Wednesday in Arcadia, the county board has 
90 days to make a recommendation to the State Board of Education. The state 
will probably take three or four months to rule. If the state finds in favor of 
redistricting, the issue will then go before voters, with election boundaries 
to be set by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Forgy, secretary to the Los Angeles County Committee on School District 
Reorganization, said the county and state committees weigh concerns such as 
whether the move would substantially alter community identity, promote ethnic 
or racial discrimination or segregation, disrupt existing educational programs, 
or increase state costs. 
</P>
<P>
The state committee receives up to nine reorganization proposals each year, and 
Forgy said the last three have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's hearing begins at 7 p.m. at Pasadena High School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The second hearing will take place at 7 p.m. at First Avenue Junior High School 
in Arcadia. The county board will make a recommendation to the State Board of 
Education, which will decide whether to allow an election.

DEPUTY CLERK PROMOTED TO CLERK/TREASURER JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has promoted Deputy City Clerk Judith E. McDonnell to city 
clerk/treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell has worked for Downey 19 years, first as executive secretary to the 
city clerk and then, since 1987, as deputy city clerk. The council voted 
Tuesday night to pay her $43,000 in her new position. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell succeeds Jenny Young-Felty, who resigned last month. Young, a former 
Whittier city clerk, did not give a reason for her resignation. Former City 
Clerk/Treasurer Robert L. Shand came out of retirement to temporarily fill the 
position.

<P>
CHURCH DENIED PERMIT TO BUILD ON RESIDENTIAL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing concerns with traffic and noise, the City Council has denied a request 
by the Danish Lutheran Church of Los Angeles to build a church in a residential 
area of Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
At its Monday meeting, the council voted 3 to 0 not to allow a 
3,500-square-foot church and a 4,000-square-foot assembly hall to be 
constructed at 11504 E. 178th St. Mayor Dennis Fellows was absent and 
Councilman Ronald Oliver abstained from voting because his property is adjacent 
to the site. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people filled the council chamber during the meeting to hear 
presentations by parishioners and residents. 
</P>
<P>
The church wanted to relocate to escape rising gang violence and crime at its 
current location in Los Angeles, according to documents filed with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The new church was proposed on 1.4 acres donated by friends of the church, Andy 
and June Andersen, who are longtime residents of Artesia.

COUNCIL PULLS THE PLUG ON FILMING PUBLIC COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in its six-year history, Compton turned off its cable 
television cameras Tuesday when it came time during the regular weekly City 
Council meeting to hear comments from members of the audience and individual 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
Just moments before it pulled the plug, the council reaffirmed the 4-1 vote it 
cast last week when Councilwoman Bernice Woods introduced a motion to limit the 
broadcasts. Woods and other council members who supported her motion complained 
that too many people use the council television broadcasts to promote 
themselves and further their political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, the live broadcasts will include only that portion of the council 
meeting that deals with items that have been put on the agenda in advance for 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, as well as Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who voted against 
pulling the plug, charged that the council's action is tantamount to censorship 
because audience comments often contain criticism of city officials and council 
policy.

<P>
ARSONISTS STRIKE MEDICAL BUILDING FOR 4TH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-alarm blaze Tuesday night -- the fourth since August in the same 
Hawaiian Gardens medical building -- was the work of an arsonist, say 
investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
There are no suspects and it is not known if the arsonist broke into the 
building, said Deputy Rafael Estrada, a department spokesman. Damage to the 
structure was estimated at $500,000, he said. Estrada would not say what led 
investigators to determine that the fire was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 Los Angeles County firefighters battled the flames that broke out on 
the second floor of the medical office building at 21530 S. Pioneer Blvd. on 
the grounds of Charter Community Hospital. The south wing of the building 
houses a clinic run by Family Health Plan, the health corporation that manages 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started, as it did three times before, in the largely vacant north end 
of the building, where a handful of private doctors rent office space. During 
the blaze, which was reported about 11:45 p.m., the roof of the structure 
reportedly collapsed and firefighters had to be pulled back for a time. No 
injuries were reported.

FOXFIELD DERBY RIDES IN AN EXCLUSIVE LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON FARLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They came from as far away as Napa Valley and Arizona to attend the exclusive 
jumping derby. 
</P>
<P>
Professionals accustomed to competing in the World Cup, Grand Prix and Olympics 
came to ride against amateurs at the annual Foxfield Jumping Derby on Sunday at 
the Foxfield Riding School in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
The event has put the Conejo Valley bedroom community in an exclusive league. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few derby competitions are held throughout the world each year. The 
oldest and most prestigious events are in Hickstead, England, and Hamburg, West 
Germany. The Foxfield derby is one of only two in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A jumping derby is different from traditional show-ring competitions because of 
the obstacles that are used. Derbies use logs, water, natural inclines and 
ditches, which are intermixed with the fence-type jumps that are found in 
show-ring events. 
</P>
<P>
Show-ring contests are particularly popular on the East Coast, where winners 
can take purses as rich as $500,000. In California, prizes on the show-ring 
circuit often reach only $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Postel, who designed the derby course and has run Foxfield Riding School 
with his family for 22 years, said the Westlake locale is unique because it has 
a permanently natural, woodsy environment that is required for derby 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing else in California like it," said Susan Hutchinson, winner of 
Sunday's jumping derby, which was sponsored by a Westlake car dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson rode Rangoon, a Holsteiner horse from her home stable in La Canada 
Flintridge. In addition to a trophy, she won $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson, who has been riding for 31 years, has been a member of the U. S. 
Equestrian Team and competed at the World Cup in Sweden and Paris. She said the 
uniqueness of the event is what draws her to compete at Foxfield, where she 
also won in 1982, 1983 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That uniqueness attracted a crowd of parents, friends and sponsors Sunday. Many 
sipped wine and snacked on Brie while lounging under shady oaks and watching 
well-groomed horses -- and well-groomed riders -- maneuver through the 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
The main event followed the Junior and Amateur Jumping Derby, sponsored by a 
Calabasas saddlery, which fielded 61 riders on 69 horses. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Eldredge, 29, of Hollister won the event on her thoroughbred Rainmaker. 
Her prize was a $3,000 saddle, a trophy and $710 in cash. She said she has won 
jumping events at the Monterey national competition and the State Fair in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight riders competed in the main derby. Horses were eligible only if 
they had not placed fifth or better in any previous event offering more than 
$15,000 in prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said because of this classification, the derby is more demanding for 
professional riders who are trying to give young horses experience in 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The triple combination, three fences in a row, proved to be the most 
troublesome obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Postel had put a water jump, which many horses are not familiar with, under the 
second fence to separate the well-schooled from the inexperienced. Most of the 
afternoon riders had no problem with the obstacle -- although some of the 
junior riders took tumbles into the water. 
</P>
<P>
In a derby, jumpers are judged in the first round on faults, which include 
refusals and the number of rails that are knocked down. Other factors, 
including riders or horses falling or exceeding the time limit, also are judged 
as faults. 
</P>
<P>
In the last round, called a jump-off, the rider with the fastest time and least 
number of faults wins. The average rider completes the course in 90 to 120 
seconds; horses typically cover the course at a speed of about 12 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Postel, who has been designing competition courses about 12 years, brought the 
derby to Foxfield because "I wanted to do something different that wasn't being 
done everywhere on a weekly basis." 
</P>
<P>
He said the derby is a training ground for young riders hoping to become 
world-class competitors. The 24-jump layout has 4-foot-high obstacles for 
advanced horse-and-rider teams. Novices face 3-foot, 9-inch obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
The variety of obstacles makes the course challenging for both horse and rider. 
</P>
<P>
But for spectators, it's just plain fun, Postel said.

TEACHER TALKS TO RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills teachers and the school district are scheduled to resume 
negotiations today under the direction of a state mediator, with both sides 
saying they are willing to go into marathon talks to avoid a strike. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers union has said it will strike Monday if a salary agreement is not 
reached. The district has offered a pay raise of 9% over two years; the Beverly 
Hills Education Assn., which represents about 300 teachers, wants double that. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Handelsman, a teacher who earns $46,000 after 26 years in the district, 
said she is ready to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had students who've gone to Harvard because I told them they can do it," 
she said as she took part in a teachers' protest march Tuesday down Rodeo 
Drive. "I'm proud of the work I've done and I think they're proud of me. . . . 
The servant is worthy of his hire." 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. Robert French earlier declined to comment on the protest but said 
he was "still very positive we'll be able to reach a settlement." He has vowed 
to keep the schools open if there is a strike and said that almost 200 
substitutes have been hired.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: IT'S LIKE KINDERGARTEN FOR MATURE ADULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sourik Avedissian met his tutor Monday afternoon in a sweltering classroom in 
south Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In an hour and a half with her, he breezed through his ABCs, learned how to 
say, "My name is Sourik" and made her understand that he has two 
granddaughters, ages 4 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
He also managed to communicate more difficult ideas with hand signals, props 
and a few English words: He came from Iran on Dec. 17, 1988, by air. Back home, 
he worked in a shop, cutting wood on a machine. He drew a picture that looked 
like a band saw and demonstrated, adding a sawing noise with his tongue, how he 
would make seven precise cuts in whatever it was he manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
For now, that's all there is to know about Avedissian, except that he sits 
formally in a chair, dresses in an Old World way -- he wore an open brown shirt 
with a kind of key design -- has a letter tattooed on each finger of his left 
hand and seems pleased that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is dead. He showed his 
feeling by drawing the side of his flattened hand across his throat. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, by the end of the semester, Avedissian will be able to tell wonderful 
tales to his tutor, Karen King. But first the two of them will spend many hours 
working over the plastic alphabet she bought at Pic 'N' Save. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the primary tools of the English-as-a-second-language volunteer. 
King is one of about 60 volunteers who meet privately with recent immigrants 
enrolled in the non-credit program at Glendale Community College. It has 2,500 
students learning English at six sites around Glendale. About 100 are matched 
up with tutors. 
</P>
<P>
Like her students, she is middle-aged. She has a career, as fund-raiser and 
publicist for the St. Barnabas Senior Citizens Center near MacArthur Park. She 
tutors after work, on her way home to Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
She became a volunteer on a whim. She saw a notice in the Glendale College 
bulletin and signed up for a 10-hour tutoring class. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it could be interesting," she said. "I went to the class and I was 
hooked." 
</P>
<P>
There is an offbeat appeal to what she does. It's like kindergarten for mature 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
Her class, which had two students Monday and may grow to as many as four, is 
for those who are at the bottom of Level 1. She calls it the minus Level 1 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"I get from that group the ones who need even more, more help," she said. "My 
goal is to get them into Level 2." 
</P>
<P>
King meets with the students Monday and Wednesday afternoons for 90 minutes at 
the college's Adult Learning Center, which opened this semester on Garfield 
Avenue near Chevy Chase Drive. The students also go to class three hours a day, 
four days each week. Some double up, taking six hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
King's goal is to teach speaking, reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a little more emphasis on speaking because it is a survival skill," she 
said. "They want to know how to speak right now." 
</P>
<P>
She began the session Monday with the family tree, illustrated with stick 
figures drawn in red marker on a sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>
King's other student, Vartoosh Alexanian, had done hers last semester and 
easily pointed out her four children and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
King drew a male figure, representing Avedissian. Then she drew a female. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a wife?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, madame," he said, nodding. 
</P>
<P>
When Avedissian got tied up in the third generation, unable to explain whether 
his two sons each had a daughter or one of them had both grandchildren, 
Alexanian tried to interject a hint in Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
"Vartoosh!" King exclaimed in mock reproach. She gave her the sign to zip her 
lip. 
</P>
<P>
King then took the fluorescent-colored alphabet from a zip-lock bag. She spread 
the letters on a tiny table around which she and the two students sat. She 
asked them to organize the letters, which they did almost without help. 
</P>
<P>
Reading them was more difficult. Neither Avedissian nor Alexanian could 
differentiate entirely between the names and the sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the name?" King asked, pointing to an M. 
</P>
<P>
"Ma," Avedissian answered. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the sound," she said. "Em." 
</P>
<P>
"Em," he would repeat. 
</P>
<P>
King finally stopped the exercise short of perfection when fatigue and 
confusion seemed to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of the day was with the personal possessive pronoun, though they 
didn't call it that. 
</P>
<P>
"What is my name?" King asked Avedissian. She beckoned with her upturned palm 
to indicate she wanted him to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Kara?" he said gravely. 
</P>
<P>
King turned to Alexanian, who smoothly handled "my," "your" and "his," though 
she sometimes dropped the verb. 
</P>
<P>
Avedissian tried again and got it almost right. 
</P>
<P>
"Good, you did it," King said. 
</P>
<P>
She urged them both to practice at home. Alexanian laughed bashfully and made 
an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Busy," she said. "Home much busy. Children, vacuum, wash, cook. . . ." She 
struggled for another word. 
</P>
<P>
King pantomimed and had her repeat a new word, ironing.

The University of Judaism and the Jewish Federation Council's Martyrs Memorial 
and Museum of the Holocaust are sponsoring a series of lectures and films on 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Thinking about the Unthinkable," the talks are intended to "reconsider

psychology and literature have anything to tell us about this dark chapter of 
human history," a statement by the organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers include authors, philosophers, film makers, a rabbi and a 
psychologist, who will deal with the impact of the killing of 6 million Jews 
and others by Germany's Nazi regime during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held on Tuesday evenings at the University of Judaism campus 
on Mulholland Drive, starting Oct. 24, for a fee of $15 a session or $105 for 
all eight. 
</P>
<P>
Four films, sponsored by the consulate general of West Germany, will be shown 
for free on successive Thursday evenings starting Oct. 26 at the Jewish 
Community Building, 6505 Wilshire Boulevard.

RETIREMENT HOMES TO MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Lutheran Homes, which operates The Alhambra retirement home at 2312 
S. Fremont Ave., is planning to merge with a Norwalk retirement home, a move 
that will make it one of the largest senior care facilities in Southern 
California, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will not be final until the board of directors for Southland 
Lutheran Home approves it Dec. 2, but California Lutheran Homes has already 
begun managing the Norwalk facility under a special agreement, said Richard 
Bennett, a California Lutheran Homes spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Alhambra is one of three retirement facilities operated by California 
Lutheran Homes, a nonprofit service organization founded in 1947. The group 
also manages independent living facilities such as Pasadena Lutheran Apartments 
in Pasadena and Pilgrim Tower in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will allow the parent group to negotiate better deals when 
purchasing supplies, thus benefiting all the homes, Bennett said.

VALLEY BLVD. CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If parts of Valley Boulevard are blighted enough to qualify as redevelopment 
project areas, should the city set up a redevelopment district there or leave 
expansion to the private sector? 
</P>
<P>
For $6,500, consultant Ralph H. Webb will answer that and other related 
questions for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, the former Baldwin Park city manager who resigned under fire in May, was 
awarded the Valley Boulevard study contract at an Alhambra Redevelopment Agency 
meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Agency Director Mike Martin said he recommended Webb Public Management Services 
of Huntington Beach for the project because of Webb's extensive experience with 
redevelopment issues in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he is up on current legislation for establishing new redevelopment 
areas," Martin said. Webb was the only consultant the city contacted, Martin 
said, describing the selection process as routine for professional services. 
</P>
<P>
If the study indicates that a redevelopment area is justified, Webb will 
develop an implementation plan. The total contract, including the preliminary 
study, is not to exceed $10,625. 
</P>
<P>
The study is part of a program to guide development along the commercial 
corridor. Webb is scheduled to report to the agency in late November.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK; 
</P>
<P>
VOTE ON SALES TAX OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare moment of unity Tuesday night, the City Council voted 5 to 0 against 
putting the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's proposal for a 
half-cent sales tax increase on the ballot. But city councils in El Monte, 
Hermosa Beach and Compton approved similar resolutions Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the commission's proposal, 30% of the tax money would be distributed to 
cities so they can improve local streets and roads. The remainder would be used 
for freeway and highway projects such as car-pool lanes and tow service patrols 
and to buy land for commuter rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
In order to place the measure on the ballot, the commission needs backing from 
44 of the county's 86 cities. It now has support from 20 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park is one of four cities that have refused to back placement of the 
sales-tax issue on the ballot. Last month, Temple City rejected a similar 
proposal. But San Gabriel Valley communities such as Covina, West Covina and 
Duarte have supported the ballot plan. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Councilman Chris Houseman questioned the plan's emphasis 
on freeway and road projects. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this is going to create more lanes for more cars to get stuck in," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy Chu said she is reluctant to support the plan partly because 
the city and other Southland communities are not adequately represented on the 
county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's enough to have just two representatives for all the cities 
outside of Long Beach and Los Angeles," Chu said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback in Monterey Park, commission spokeswoman Brynn Kernaghan 
said she is optimistic the county will be able to round up enough support by 
the end of next month to get the measure on the ballot.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
APARTMENT PROJECT REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Hollywood Hills area were neither fooled nor amused when a 
developer took a unique "time machine" approach to building a new apartment 
complex overlooking the Hollywood Freeway. Members of the Los Angeles City 
Planning Commission were likewise not taken in by Lincoln Properties' bid to 
use a 24-year-old permit to build a 200-unit apartment project just off 
Mulholland Drive, but the panel appeared to take the unusual approach with more 
humor than the angry residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I take my hat off to you. It certainly was creative," Commissioner Theodore 
Stein Jr. told Doug Ring, attorney for the developer at last week's Planning 
Commission hearing. The "creative" approach that drew outrage from citizens and 
snickers from commission members has a long and complicated history. The 
developer argued that a loophole in a use permit granted in 1965 for the 
28-acre property would allow him to go forth with the expansive construction, 
even though the permit was to have expired after six months. 
</P>
<P>
The property is currently zoned to allow the building of no more than three or 
four single-family homes, according to Planning Commission staff. Although it 
had given varying interpretations of the validity of the old permit in the last 
decade, the Los Angeles city attorney's office ruled in May that the permit was 
no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed, Lincoln representatives took their chances with a roomful of hostile 
residents before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
After the unusual bid was denied, spokesmen for the developer said an appeal 
before the City Council is possible.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL TAX PROPOSED TO PAY FOR RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach landowners would pay another $8 million a year in property taxes 
under a proposal to finance expanded recreation programs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's Quality of Life Committee this week sent the proposal to the 
full council, which must approve the measure before it can be put on the ballot 
for a public vote next year. Such a special tax levy would require a two-thirds 
approval by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Residential property owners would pay 80% of the new tax, on the theory that 
they would enjoy most of the benefits of the recreational programs. City 
officials estimate that annual property tax increases on residential units 
would range from about $38 to $71 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be used to fund programs for youths and the elderly, added park 
patrols and park maintenance. Although the city's finances improved this year, 
the city budget is still too tight to support such expanded activities without 
additional income, say the proposal's proponents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark, while supporting the new tax, warned that it will take a 
concerted community effort to garner the necessary voter support. Many voters, 
Clark said, will consider it a reversal of Proposition 13, the landmark voter 
referendum that greatly limited local property tax increases around the state.

COAST CLUB RAZING BLAMED ON MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Chenoweth (executive director of a Minneapolis organization that drew up a 
plan to save the Pacific Coast Club) is absolutely correct when he lays the 
blame for the destruction of the Pacific Coast Club at the feet of Long Beach 
Mayor Ernie Kell (Times, Oct. 1). Kell was the one who coldly ignored the 
outcry of citizens trying to save the landmark building. If the mayor had shown 
any fortitude or guts, that beautiful building would still be standing. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need to fly in from Minnesota to experience Long Beach city officials 
who behave like "a bunch of Neanderthals" or a mayor who consistently exhibits 
"the lowest standards of democratic procedures." Under Kell's poor imitation of 
leadership, the heritage of Long Beach has been gang raped by greedy developers 
whose only friends sit in the overstuffed chairs of the City Council. From 
their luxury view offices, the once-classic skyline must look like model toys 
that can be removed on an uneducated whim. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that Kell could not be reached for comment on the 
Chenoweth revelations. The mayor's conscience and value system have been 
unavailable to public scrutiny since he took office. While 5,000 homeless men, 
women and small children wander helpless and dazed through our city, Kell has 
facilitated only the rapid development of more luxury hotels and office 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if what replaced our demolished treasures had been for the betterment 
of the city, one could chalk it up to progress and a move in the right 
direction. But Kell has presided over a downtown redevelopment that most 
citizens consider a sad joke. From the ugliest, least desirable mall on the 
West Coast, to the fear and loathing that keeps downtown a vacant wasteland, 
the mark of Kell has left a nasty stain on the image of Long Beach, one his 
standard "No comment" will not erase. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kell now talks big about being responsible for establishing the 
Neighborhood and Historic Preservation Commission. That may fool the small 
percentage of Long Beach voters who actually cast ballots for him, but to the 
rest of us he is as credible as the Chinese government's version of what 
happened in Tiananmen Square.

W. HOLLYWOOD RESIDENTS OBJECT TO SCALE OF PROJECT FOR ELDERLY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: EVERYONE AGREES THAT WEST HOLLYWOOD NEEDS MORE SENIOR HOUSING, BUT THE 
ROSSMOOR REGENCY, A PROPOSED LUXURY RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX, IS UNDER FIRE FOR ITS 
SIZE AND HIGH FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 2-year-old proposal to build a luxury senior residential complex in West 
Hollywood nears the end of the public hearing gantlet, about the only thing 
opponents in the fight agree on is that the city needs more senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed six-story, 152-unit Rossmoor Regency senior care residence on the 
Beverly Hills border would violate city height and density restrictions for a 
residential neighborhood, but developers say city officials should approve the 
project because of the overriding value of senior housing in a city where more 
than one-third of the residents are over 55. 
</P>
<P>
If that argument isn't quite enough, Rossmoor Enterprises Inc. of Laguna Hills, 
which developed the sprawling Leisure World senior retirement communities in 
Orange County, is also dangling a $1-million donation to city housing coffers 
to help with low-income housing, if the project is approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smooth Sailing 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the proposed site on Doheny Drive between Harland and Keith 
avenues, including many seniors, have in recent months disrupted what had been 
smooth sailing for the proposal, complaining that the facility is too big. They 
say Rossmoor would loom 50 feet over the single-family homes in the area, 
obscuring skylines, casting shadows and causing traffic to be clogged with 
delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also say the estimated $2,000 to $3,000 a month it would cost to live 
at the complex would keep most West Hollywood seniors from living there. The 
$1-million gift from the developer, they say, is an enticement for betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the (city) is not willing to sell the (area) for 30 pieces of silver," 
E. (Budd) Kops, community activist and resident of the area, told the West 
Hollywood Planning Commission last week. "I know if you dangle (]1 million in 
front of some members of the City Council, they'll bite." 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 West Hollywood residents stood in opposition to the Rossmoor plan 
before the commission last week. The proposal had experienced little opposition 
until neighbors began organizing about a year ago. Rossmoor tried to alleviate 
fears of neighbors with guarantees that the building would have 
traffic-reducing shuttles, adequate parking and widened streets to accommodate 
delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
But Rossmoor spokesman Jeffrey A. Seymour said the height of the project is not 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
"You would make the allowance for greater height and density because of the 
significant contributions to quality of life in West Hollywood," Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lift Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Under the city's General Plan, height and density restrictions can be lifted if 
a project is shown to be beneficial to the community as a whole. Rossmoor has 
argued that the Regency project would benefit local seniors, and hence, all of 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring city of Beverly Hills, which would also feel increased traffic 
and catch shadows from the Regency, sent members of its Planning Department to 
express support for the plan -- as long as the design of the building is 
altered so that the outside portions of the blocklong building would rise to 
only three stories, with the center rising -- in pyramid fashion -- to six 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission eventually sided with concerned neighbors when it 
tentatively approved a chopped-off version of Rossmoor that could not exceed 45 
feet in height, which is less than four stories. The panel was on the verge of 
shooting down the whole project, but fear that the City Council would reverse 
that action led it into the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the City Council has abandoned neighborhood preservation, and I 
think they are going to do it again here," said Planning Commissioner Stephen 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
In West Hollywood and most other cities, city councils have the final say on 
development projects and may overrule commission decisions if an appeal is 
brought by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Smith later said the city had "meekly caved in to big development at the 
expense of neighborhood sanctity" in several recent debates. He said he was 
referring to recent City Council action allowing expansion at the Writers Guild 
of America West Inc. headquarters off Beverly Boulevard after the planning 
commission had rejected the plans. He also cited the city's agreements with 
"bellicose" Severyn Ashkenazy, in which the hotelier was allowed to convert 
apartment buildings to hotels under certain conditions in exchange for payments 
of fees and back taxes to the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cash Register Mentality' 
</P>
<P>
"More and more there is a cash register mentality in this city," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman John Heilman, whom Smith singled out for criticism, said those 
planning decisions were based on "the long-range view of the council" but 
acknowledged that the potential $1-million windfall from Rossmoor Regency is 
the life preserver keeping the project afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that makes it worth considering at (the six-story) height is 
that it does, indirectly, through money to the city housing corporation, help 
low-income housing," said Heilman. "The money will certainly be something the 
city considers in its decision, but I don't think it would lead us to approve a 
harmful project." 
</P>
<P>
Heilman, who was treasurer of a committee supporting a bond issue, also said 
donations made to that committee last April by people connected with Rossmoor 
were "no doubt to try and curry favor with us." But such donations are legal, 
he said, adding "I never make any promises, and I never would." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why people make those kind of contributions, but I think (Rossmoor) 
also recognized the need for city services" in supporting the unsuccessful 
measure that would have provided funds for a new firehouse and library, Heilman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Planning Commission has yet to approve a formal resolution on the 
building, the next move will be up to the developer. Faced with accepting a 
scaled-down version, abandoning the project along with as much as a half a 
million dollars in initial development costs, or appealing the Planning 
Commission's decision to the City Council, Rossmoor spokesmen said the choice 
is almost certain. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the appeal of the decision is highly likely," Seymour said.

COUNCIL POSTPONES HOME ALLOCATION DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After moving boldly two months ago to clamp a first-ever population cap on 
Ventura, City Council members were in a more timid mood this week as it came 
time to divvy up the 185 new homes that will be allowed built each year during 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than adopt an allocation system for builders, council members decided to 
let the new figures sink in. 
</P>
<P>
"I need more time to digest this," Mayor James Monahan said Monday as officials 
sat down to discuss how to divide up building allotments while maintaining the 
city's new 102,000-resident population cap. About 92,000 people now live in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Developers representatives and others had waited in the wooden-paneled council 
chambers to argue for their share of future building permits. 
</P>
<P>
Over the objections of the council's two strongest slow-growth advocates, 
council members postponed action until Oct. 30 to give them time to schedule an 
informal public workshop on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to face it sooner or later," Councilman Don Villeneuve argued, 
urging the council to complete the action Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already had . . . seven nights of public hearings on this," added 
Councilman Richard Francis, referring to the adoption in August of the 
Comprehensive Plan that set the population cap. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan and council members Nan Drake, William Crew and John McWherter voted 
for postponement. Monahan and Drake face reelection next month. The new plan 
limits the city's population to 115,000 over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
It sets the city's population cap at 102,000 in the year 2000, unless the city 
or its contracted water districts are able to build a pipeline to import state 
water, or find other means of increasing the local water supply. 
</P>
<P>
If the water supply is increased, the 10-year cap grows to 105,000. 
</P>
<P>
Working backward from the number of new homes that a population of 102,000 
would support, city planners have calculated that a total of 1,850 homes can be 
constructed over 10 years.

RESTAURANTS: BUCKING A TREND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, THE CITY'S LONE SPOT FOR 
TRADITIONAL NEW YORK-STYLE DELICATESSEN FARE IS STRUGGLING.

<P>
When New York's Carnegie Deli opened a spot in Beverly Hills this summer, the 
kitchen ran out of food the first day. At Juniors Deli in Westwood, there is 
standing room only. They say an elderly man once fainted in the packed lobby of 
Nate 'n' Al's in Beverly Hills, and when they revived him, he wanted to know if 
he'd lost his place in line. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much business out there it's ridiculous," Juniors' owner Marvin 
Saul said. 
</P>
<P>
Except in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The deli wars are raging all over Los Angeles County, but in Long Beach, they 
haven't even fired a shot. 
</P>
<P>
There are still people in Long Beach who have never tasted a bagel. ("I've 
heard bagels are just like rocks.") People in Long Beach who fear bagels. ("Do 
I have to have my sandwich on a bagel?") 
</P>
<P>
There are Italian delis and Chinese delis and submarine-sandwich shops that 
call themselves delis. But when it comes to a New York-style, Jewish deli where 
you can find a decent knish, Long Beach is a one-deli town. And the one deli in 
Long Beach is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Long Beach are marvelous. You would not believe the number of 
Gentiles who come in to wish me a happy New Year," said Bert Markovitz, owner 
of the Bagel Bistro, the only traditional Jewish deli in the city limits. "It's 
a shame I have to make a living. Otherwise, I would enjoy this." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Long Beach has the World Trade Center. Sure it claims to be "the most on 
the coast." But if a city does not cry out for a restaurant where the smell of 
pastrami and hot dogs hits you in the face, where the waitresses ignore you and 
make your life miserable, can it ever be truly cosmopolitan? 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach is virgin territory, you'll forgive the expression," Saul said. 
"The San Fernando Valley didn't exist until it got a half-dozen delis. It's 
part of being cosmopolitan. It's part of being avant-garde. You can't be 
anywhere unless you've got a decent deli." 
</P>
<P>
It is not just the fact that a sizable number of Jews migrated from 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach to Orange County years ago. Deli mavens say their customers include 
"yuppies, yippies, blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Italians -- you name it, we've 
got it." As the late Leo Steiner, who made New York's Carnegie Deli famous, put 
it: "Who doesn't know chopped liver?" 
</P>
<P>
"A nice Jewish lady explained it to me," said Belle Markovitz, Bert's business 
partner and wife. "Long Beach was settled by a bunch of people from Iowa, and 
they didn't know delis from nothin.' But I don't believe it. Long Beach is a 
beautiful city. It's so centrally located. It just isn't ethnic." 
</P>
<P>
The Markovitzes had been running delis for 35 years, from Manhattan to the 
Bronx to Encino, when they moved to Long Beach a couple of years ago with every 
intention of getting out of the deli business. It was a virtual act of mercy 
when they opened the Bagel Bistro at 45th and Atlantic in Bixby Knolls, a 
storefront operation with a case full of knockwurst and a room full of red 
tables, most of them empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early-Morning Start 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around and said, 'Where you gonna get a dozen bagels when you're 
having people over?' " said Belle, a friendly woman with a red apron who gets 
up at 4 every morning to start baking bagels. She knows her customers not by 
their first names but by what they like to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell your sister I said hello," Belle said, handing $6.52 worth of creamed 
herring and rye bread to a stooped lady in her 80s who was admiring the olives. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my sister," the lady said, the cuffs of her pants rolled up around her 
blue sneakers. "She fractured her hip and that was bad, and then the next thing 
she did she fractured her vertebra, and I had to call 911 to get her up." 
</P>
<P>
"Well my dear, you have a happy and healthy New Year," Belle said 
sympathetically.

It was 4 on a Tuesday afternoon, three days after Rosh Hashanah and six days 
before Yom Kippur, and the counter girl was already sweeping up. At the same 
time in New York, the customers would have been lining up for an early dinner 
or a couple of pounds of corned beef to take home, Belle said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cohen's Deli 
</P>
<P>
For 39 years, Cohen's Deli thrived on East Anaheim Street in Long Beach, but 
business was dwindling when it closed in 1985. Two years passed before the 
Bagel Bistro opened, and for two years Long Beach did just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Harmatz, who founded Cohen's and has since retired to Lakewood, said he got 
too old to eat deli food, and he thinks the rest of Long Beach did too. 
</P>
<P>
"Older people can't eat that stuff," Harmatz said. "Everything is pickled, 
smoked and cured. When you pass the 50 or 60 mark, you gotta watch yourself." 
</P>
<P>
But many people insist that there is a demand for good deli food in this town 
and that, in fact, some Long Beach residents drive as far away as Beverly Hills 
for brisket. Others just suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss a good, juicy corned beef sandwich. I love pastrami. I love tongue," 
said Long Beach City Councilman Evan Braude. "I can't tell you how many times 
I've thought of opening a deli myself. But I'm too busy doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
Bert and Belle Markovitz would stack their pastrami against anything you buy in 
Los Angeles. The trouble is, a lot of people in Long Beach, including Braude, 
do not know his place exists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sprouts and Decor 
</P>
<P>
Storefront delis such as his might make it in New York, Juniors' Marvin Saul 
said. But in L.A., people want sprouts and decor. "You have to give them a 
little schmaltz," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach still has some growing up to do, its civic leaders admit, and a 
Midwestern image to shake. But it won't be a chicken pot pie city forever. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Saul declared. "I love Long Beach. I was there last spring. When I retire 
and give Juniors to my sons, I'm going to open another restaurant, and Long 
Beach will be the place. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes half a million people to support one big deli. Long Beach has what, 
400,000? In another 10 years, Long Beach will be ready for one big Juniors."

OH, DEER, THEY'RE TRASHING THE GARDEN AGAIN!; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE FAUNA ARE SEVERELY AFFECTING THE FLORA, AS DEVELOPMENT 
SQUEEZES DEER OUT OF THEIR HABITUAL TERRITORY INTO HOMEOWNERS' BACK YARDS. 
</P>

Call them urban deer. Driven by increasing hillside development and persistent 
drought conditions, they venture into an unlikely and often unwelcome 
environment, from busy streets and residential gardens in the San Fernando 
Valley to the pounding surf of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Their search for food and water brings them into almost daily contact with 
residents of communities that border the canyons and foothills of the Santa 
Monica and Santa Susana mountains, particularly in areas where new development 
is displacing existing wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drink From Pools 
</P>
<P>
Lost and panicked deer have been injured and killed on canyon roads. They have 
been spotted along Ventura Boulevard in Encino and outside upscale restaurants 
and chic boutiques, struggling to find their way back to the mountains, animal 
control officers said. 
</P>
<P>
They drink from back-yard swimming pools, feast on roses and begonias, dart 
down quiet streets, and stroll along lush country-club fairways. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate conflict between mountain development and the wilderness," 
commented Rob Glushon, president of the Encino Property Owners Assn., who 
observed four deer during a recent round of golf at the El Caballero Country 
Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Deer have always inhabited the area mountains. State and local officials 
estimate that 9,000 live in the vast and undeveloped ranges of the San Gabriel 
Mountains and anywhere from several hundred to more than 1,000 are in the Santa 
Monicas and Santa Susanas. 
</P>
<P>
The animals have been turning up near hillside residences for years. But state 
Department of Fish and Game officers say more of them appear to be venturing 
into urban areas as new developments invade their territory and the drought 
stretches into its third year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Consolation 
</P>
<P>
"A deer is like any other animal," said Jon Fischer, a wildlife biologist with 
Fish and Game. "It will go where food is easiest to get, and if I water my back 
yard and it is full of succulent flowers, a deer would be crazy to stay 400 
yards away and eat dry grass. So they are overcoming their fear of people and 
coming into back yards." 
</P>
<P>
Enchanted by their beauty and grace, hillside dwellers often welcome the deer 
-- at first. But the novelty wears off once the animals start eating expensive 
flowers and ravaging gardens that took years to create. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials offer homeowners little consolation. They can't move 
the deer, they say, because that would overpopulate existing animal ranges and 
lead to starvation and disease. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they say, deer adapt poorly to new areas. When 200 were moved from 
Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay to Napa County 10 years ago, 80% wound up 
dead on local roads within three weeks, most of them victims of traffic 
accidents, said Larry Sitton, wildlife management program supervisor for Fish 
and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers, who warn that deer can be dangerous if cornered, 
recommend using commercial repellents or lion droppings to keep them away. But 
homeowners who have tried those remedies say they offer only a temporary 
reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Food Sources 
</P>
<P>
"We have no ivy left," said Susan Gottsegen, who lives on Coronet Drive in 
Encino. "They ate the whole hillside. It's barren. They come three and four at 
a time, and they're very brazen. They come right down and walk on the street. I 
have a German shepherd, and they're not even afraid of her. She barks at them, 
and they just keep grazing. They've become domesticated. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time my neighbors saw one, they said, 'Look, it's Bambi!' " 
Gottsegen recalled. "They thought it was so beautiful -- until Bambi started 
eating all their flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Gottsegen has lived on Coronet Drive for 26 years. She said she never had a 
problem until grading began for the 178-home Caballero Canyon development at 
Reseda and Ventura boulevards. She suspects that the deer have come from there, 
seeking new shelter and food sources. 
</P>
<P>
"They have nowhere else to turn," said Sonia Thompson, program manager for the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, who predicts that the deer population in 
Los Angeles will ultimately perish as their habitat is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have no natural vegetation in the canyons and no water sources, and 
they go down to gardens where people put out poison . . . that is sort of a 
death warrant right there. Then there are domestic dogs that chase them into 
the road, where they are hit by cars." 
</P>
<P>
About 18 deer are killed by motorists each year in the West Valley area, said 
Irene Malloy, president of the Marine and Wildlife Rescue Station in Agoura 
Hills, who helped prepare a 1988 study on animal fatalities for the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
But the number could be even higher. In September, 10 deer were hit and killed 
by cars in the West Valley area served by the county's animal care and control 
center in Agoura, said Lt. Martin Broad of the West Valley Animal Care and 
Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deer Grow Confused 
</P>
<P>
Most are traveling between the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains, where 
only one wildlife corridor remains, she said. The deer grow confused and 
venture into oncoming traffic. One died two weeks ago on Agoura Road in an 
incident that occurs so frequently that Malloy has started calling the drag 
"death row for deer." 
</P>
<P>
"The desecration of deer in this canyon is pitiful," said Malloy, who lives in 
Liberty Canyon. "It's tragic." 
</P>
<P>
There also have been problems along Mulholland Drive, Coldwater Canyon Avenue 
and Beverly Glen and Laurel Canyon boulevards. "Deer live in there," said 
Dennis Kroeplin, a wildlife officer with the city-operated West Valley Animal 
Care and Control Center. "They have trails that cross those roads, that were 
there before the roads. You find deer-crossing signs to caution drivers, but 
they still get killed." 
</P>
<P>
State game warden John Hernandez said he recently helped rescue a buck that was 
chased by stray dogs all the way to the ocean in Malibu. "It wouldn't come near 
the shore," Hernandez said. "We had to get everyone back so it felt confident 
returning to the hills." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Nieman never had deer problems at his Encino hills home until last spring, 
when his dog died. Now six deer frequent his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"They've eaten hundreds of dollars of begonias," Nieman said. "You feel sorry 
for them. The poor deer, they're hungry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Advice 
</P>
<P>
Nieman took the advice of animal control officers, drove to the Wildlife 
Waystation in Little Tujunga and picked up lion droppings that he placed around 
his property. It worked -- for two weeks. Then the deer were back. 
</P>
<P>
"This is insane," Nieman said. "I can't lick it. I'm not going to do this every 
two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
In Sherman Oaks, deer feasted all summer on 75 rosebushes that surround J. 
Hardy's hillside home. "They've just stripped them," said Hardy, who peered out 
her bedroom window late one night in July and found herself staring a deer in 
the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed," she said, "and it went flying." 
</P>
<P>
Animal advocates say development is the greatest threat to deer in the Los 
Angeles region. "When you stop and think of the growth in Southern California, 
that's not surprising," Fischer said. "We build houses and put up fences. We've 
restricted their movement. So what has been historically deer habitat is now 
somebody's back yard." 
</P>

RACING PIGEON OWNERS CAREFUL TO DODGE FLAK FROM NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Quietly, before the neighbors awaken each day, dozens of South Bay residents go 
out to their dew-laden back yards to enjoy a sport that has been getting some 
of them in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Whistling and clucking softly to their athletes, they round up a practice team 
and send them winging away. After a few darting circles, the team disappears 
into the morning sky. 
</P>
<P>
Pigeon racing, often regarded as a barnyard sport, has been a little-noticed 
part of city living for decades. Enthusiasts say more than 90% of all American 
pigeon racing takes place from lofts tucked away in city and suburban back 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
As cities have grown and people have moved closer together, however, pigeon 
racers have begun to ruffle their neighbors' feathers. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, the feud between racer and neighbor has blossomed into a 
full-scale pigeon war. Two pigeon racers in the last three months have faced 
City Council hearings on whether they should be allowed to keep their birds. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Paul Woehlcke, won a narrow victory but has decided to move out of 
the area, in part because neighbors remain angry at his 75 birds. 
</P>
<P>
Council members reached a six-month compromise on the second racer, Roger 
Mortvedt, that requires him to reduce his flock from 100 pigeons to 60 and 
limits how often they may fly. 
</P>
<P>
A third man, Vince Orefice, testified to the City Council on behalf of his 
racing colleagues and now fears for the future of his own birds because he has 
been ordered to apply for a city pigeon-keeping permit. 
</P>
<P>
Without the permit, Orefice would be allowed to keep only four pigeons, far 
fewer than the 50 or 60 birds South Bay racers say they need to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
If any neighbors complain, Orefice could face city hearings on his flock. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the South Bay's roughly 70 pigeon racers is not new. 
</P>
<P>
A similar fight flared in Manhattan Beach four years ago when a pigeon racer's 
birds were accused of messing up neighbors' yards. In Torrance, pigeon fanciers 
were banned in 1965 from keeping more than four birds after a man who trapped 
and bred wild pigeons in Hollywood Riviera allowed his flock to sit -- and drop 
-- on a neighboring Superior Court judge's house. 
</P>
<P>
The law remained unchanged until February of this year, when Mortvedt and 
Woehlcke, threatened with losing their flocks, persuaded the City Council to 
approve a special permit allowing the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities have laws banning large flocks of domestic pigeons, but the 
fanciers who race the birds in those cities either are not aware of the laws or 
believe that they will not be enforced if owners keep a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Several anti-pigeon Torrance residents, still smarting from their two council 
defeats, have founded a new community group they call RAP -- Residents Against 
Pigeons -- to make sure the issue remains high-profile. 
</P>
<P>
In a newsletter that sports a logo of a chirping bird with a black line through 
it, the group insists that pigeon breeding should be banned from densely 
populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Citing health studies that say pigeon guano can carry a number of dangerous 
airborne diseases, RAP argues that each pigeon racer endangers scores of his 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Form of Poultry Raising 
</P>
<P>
"It's a form of poultry raising. We have only 6,000-square-foot lots, so we're 
living on top of each other here," said David Brent, one of the group's 
founders. "This belongs on a farm. Pigeon breeding in a congested area like 
ours is not appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Mortvedt's outraged neighbors agree. A parade of them appeared before the 
Torrance City Council last month to complain about droppings in their yards, on 
their cars and in their pools. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like a prisoner in our own home," said John Perparas, who lives two 
houses away from Mortvedt. "They do defecate in flight. I have seen them." 
</P>
<P>
Perparas complained that when it comes time to sell his house, he will be 
forced to disclose information about Mortvedt's pigeons to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Which house would you buy?" he asked the Torrance City Council during debate 
over the pigeons. "The one with 100 pigeons next door or the one without?" 
</P>
<P>
Racers, however, say their birds are the victims of mistaken identity by 
observers who assume that wild pigeons seen roosting around the neighborhood 
are actually a domestic flock. 
</P>
<P>
"To most people, a pigeon is a pigeon is a pigeon," said Joe Arrigo, the 
Manhattan Beach racer who in 1985 won a city permit to keep his flock. "The 
public attention is drawn to all these birds that are nuisances, like the ones 
in parking lots and on public buildings that are not controlled. They do make a 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
Domestic racing pigeons are about as similar to the average wild "flying rat" 
pigeon, fanciers insist, as a plow nag is to Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Bred Athletes 
</P>
<P>
"They're highly bred athletes, born for racing," Mortvedt said. "They don't 
hang out on fences and wires messing up the neighborhood because they're 
trained not to do that. You can win or lose a race by seconds, so you don't 
want them to get in the habit of hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
Racing pigeons released for exercise flights and races have not eaten in 
several hours, breeders say, leaving nothing for them to drop when they take to 
the skies. 
</P>
<P>
"When any bird flies, it's to his advantage to be as light as possible because 
when his weight is heavy it requires a lot of energy," said Cornell University 
pigeon researcher Irene Brown. "Consequently, when birds take off, they usually 
relieve themselves of their droppings before they even leave the premises." 
</P>
<P>
RAP members are not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not supernatural birds that are so well-controlled that they can hold 
it back forever," Brent said. "When you've got to go, you've got to go, and 
they circle the neighborhood and they do it." 
</P>
<P>
It is the perception that their birds are the scourge of their neighborhoods 
that has made pigeon racers throughout the South Bay a wary group. 
</P>
<P>
During the racing season, which runs from September to November for young birds 
and from April to June for the older pigeons, racers from throughout the South 
Bay gather on weekends at their Hawthorne clubhouse -- a borrowed room in the 
American Youth Soccer Organization's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Many racers interviewed during the preparations for a recent race from Fresno 
to Southern California told a reporter that they did not want their names used 
because it might attract attention to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my birds for 15 years and some of my neighbors still don't know 
they're there," one racer said. "Why would I want to create a problem where 
there isn't one?" 
</P>
<P>
For many of the men -- only three or four of the South Bay's roughly 70 racers 
are women -- pigeons are an essential part of their lives. Although racers 
usually only name a handful of their flock, each bird, they say, is special to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of them as humans. Each one has a personality all its own," said Danny 
Hinds, 62, a retired Sun Valley bread truck driver who now makes his living 
taking truckloads of racing pigeons from the South Bay and Orange County 
hundreds of miles to distant release points. 
</P>
<P>
"One I named Mongoose, because he was a sneaky little devil. I've got one I 
call Bull Durham. He's a mean bird," Hinds said. "They just fascinate me, all 
of them. I mean, they only weigh 16 ounces, and they've got the heart of a 
lion." 
</P>
<P>
After several practice releases at increasing distances from their home loft, 
birds enter their first 100-mile race when they are only a few months old. The 
racing distance is increased roughly 50 miles each weekend of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The night before a race, competitors take 15 or 20 of their birds to the 
clubhouse, where $500 racing clocks are synchronized and each pigeon is fitted 
with a numbered elastic leg band before being placed in spring-loaded holding 
crates. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty or so birds are placed in each crate, with males separated from females 
to prevent any "hanky-panky" during the long trip to the release site, one 
racer explained. The crates are then fitted onto special trucks equipped to 
open all the doors at once at the start of a race. 
</P>
<P>
During the preparation hours for a race, enthusiasts trade tips and enjoy some 
good-natured banter. Occasionally, the fastest birds trade hands for as much as 
$1,000 to become breeding stock in a new loft. Such sales are rare, racers 
insist, because young birds are often given away to help a new racer get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do this for the money," Mortvedt said. "If I was going to be paid by 
the hour for what I put into these birds, I'd be a rich man. The greatest thing 
for me is to win and be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, trucks from several clubhouses meet at the assigned 
release point, which can be as far away as Oregon. After a short countdown, the 
crate doors spring open and a confusion of competing birds, sometimes as many 
as 15,000, thunder out in a whir of beating wings. 
</P>
<P>
Looking like a swarm of bees searching for a hive, the pigeons circle the 
release point several times, climbing higher and slowly getting their bearings. 
Eventually they dart off, racing at speeds up to 60 m.p.h. toward their distant 
lofts. 
</P>
<P>
Although scientists have discovered that homing pigeons can detect many things 
humans cannot -- infrasound that is inaudible to the human ear, ultraviolet 
light that is invisible to the human eye and magnetic fields that are not 
detectable by the human body -- they still are not sure how pigeons pull all 
this information together to find their home loft. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem is, how do pigeons know where they are relative to home?" 
Cornell researcher Brown said. "It's one thing to get the compass headings down 
and know which way is north and south and all that, but how do they know which 
way is home? We've never found a pigeon carrying a little map showing where the 
release point is relative to home." 
</P>
<P>
As the birds filter down toward Southern California, owners who live closer to 
the release point call their more distant colleagues to report that the birds 
are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious South Bay owners, warned by San Fernando Valley racers that the birds 
are coming in, stand in their yards ready to urge the arriving pigeons quickly 
into their home loft. 
</P>
<P>
Catching each bird as it arrives, the owner slides off the pigeon's elastic leg 
band and pops it into a chamber in his racing clock, where the time is recorded 
and sealed until a club official reads the results. 
</P>
<P>
The pigeon that covers the greatest distance in the least time, measured as 
yards per second, is declared the winner. It's not uncommon for some birds to 
travel more than 60 m.p.h. for an entire day to reach their loft. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent race from Fresno, one of Roger Mortvedt's pigeons came home so fast 
that he was not ready for her. The 6-month-old bird had been in the loft nearly 
a minute, he said, before he sealed her leg band in his clock. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the delay, the unnamed pigeon won second place -- out of 12,000 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
After 31 years of pigeon racing, such results are not uncommon for Mortvedt, 
president of a three-club coalition called the Southern California Racing 
Pigeon Combine, which covers Los Angeles County from west Los Angeles through 
the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Mortvedt achieved the pinnacle of American pigeon racing: a national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Only four or five such champions are selected each year in several age and 
competition categories, based on their record of victories and their speed 
during races. Mortvedt's champion -- which, like most of his other birds, is 
nameless -- is now kept locked away as part of his breeding stock. 
</P>
<P>
Mortvedt's success also makes it even harder to think that he might have to 
give up the sport. 
</P>

flights home. ; Photo, Roger and Anne Mortvedt check on their prized racing

ACADEMICS: FOOTBALL ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT ATTRACTS LEONARD RUSSELL TO THE 
WALNUT CAMPUS. HE'S HAD TO BUCKLE DOWN IN CLASS -- AND HE LIKES IT.

<P>
It was not the world's best recruiting effort that attracted former high school 
All-America running back Leonard Russell to Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
It was more like a world of good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mt. San Antonio Coach Bill Fisk didn't even have to step foot outside 
his office on campus to recruit Russell. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very fortunate," Fisk said. "His parents moved close to our school, 
and on the first day of classes he just walked into my office and asked if he 
could come out." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it wasn't quite that simple. 
</P>
<P>
Russell said the academic environment surrounding the football program at Mt. 
San Antonio also played a vital role in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When my mother and father moved out to Walnut, I knew the JC (junior college) 
was right down the street but I didn't know they had a football team," he said. 
"So I came down here and found out they did. My mom talked to the coach and he 
seemed like a good guy and he was concerned about academics, so I came out (for 
the team)." 
</P>
<P>
Fisk said the presence of the 19-year-old sophomore at Mt. San Antonio has been 
instrumental in the renaissance of the school's football program. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something we didn't expect," Fisk said of Russell's arrival. "Something 
like that can turn your program around." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Mt. San Antonio, it has turned the program around. 
</P>
<P>
After not producing a winning record since 1982, the Mounties finished at 8-3 
and won the Southern California Bowl last year in Russell's first year with the 
team. Mt. San Antonio was even ranked as high as No. 3 in the state at 2-0 this 
season before dropping its last two games by close margins. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk said it is no coincidence that the program blossomed as soon as Russell 
joined the team. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my 24th year of coaching here, and he's probably the best back I've 
had come through as far as the things he can do," he said. "He's a team leader, 
he's our team captain and he's a very hard worker." 
</P>
<P>
The coach is hardly overstating his point. 
</P>
<P>
In only 15 games with the Mounties, Russell has already shattered most of the 
school's rushing records. He ran for 1,618 yards and eight touchdowns in 278 
carries last season -- a school record for yards and carries. 
</P>
<P>
With 723 yards and six touchdowns in 117 carries this season, he has already 
surpassed the school's all-time career record for rushing yardage with 2,341 
and is on a pace to break his own single-season record by the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
From Russell's perspective, the success on the field has been gratifying. But 
for Russell, the biggest satisfaction has come from his improvement 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the academics, I knew I wasn't as disciplined in the classroom as I 
was on the football field," Russell said. "I wanted to be in a program where 
people pushed me academically, and that's the way it's been here." 
</P>
<P>
He said the coaching staff is concerned with more than just the results of the 
players on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here I didn't know what to expect, but Coach Fisk and Coach 
(Paul) Russell really care a lot about us," Russell said. "I know some programs 
that just let the player take enough units to keep playing, but at Mt. SAC they 
get you to take the classes you need so you can get your (associate of arts) 
degree and have a choice of (four-year) schools that you can attend." 
</P>
<P>
Russell said the academic climate is far better for him at Mt. San Antonio than 
it was at his first college stop, Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have asked for a better situation to come into," he said. "I feel 
I'm a better student-athlete -- not just an athlete. I'm a much better student 
than I was before I came here. I was lacking academically before, but now I 
know I've improved a lot. When I came from Arizona State, I came in with a 1.8 
(grade-point average), and I've been here a whole year plus summer school and 
it's now at 2.8 and getting better." 
</P>
<P>
He said his academic problems started when he was a high school star at Long 
Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not studying as hard as I could," Russell admitted. "I was going to 
class. I wasn't the type who didn't go to class. It's just that when homework 
was assigned I didn't do it. It was like I wasn't a bad student when I was in 
class. I paid attention and I tried to contribute. It's just that once I left 
the classroom I didn't have the discipline and I didn't take it home with me." 
</P>
<P>
There was more attention paid to his athletic skills in high school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was more pressure on me to be a better athlete than a student at Long 
Beach Poly for some reason," Russell said. "Maybe it was because we always had 
such good athletes there and you were always compared to people in that way. 
You never heard about academics. It seemed like there was more pressure to do 
well on the field and academics came later." 
</P>
<P>
Once he was recruited for college and signed a national letter of intent to 
attend Arizona State, Russell's academic situation did anything but improve. 
Because he didn't have a 2.0 grade-point average in high school, Russell had to 
sit out his freshman season under the NCAA's Proposition 48 guidelines and the 
adjustment to life as a college student was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big adjustment being independent," Russell said. "I had to get up on 
my own, go to classes on my own, and the teachers don't take role. I was away 
from home and I didn't apply myself. I thought: 'Well, I'm finally here. That's 
it.' I thought I could just show up and not have to worry about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, he says attending a major college such as Arizona State may have 
been a mistake considering his educational background. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably shouldn't have gone straight to a university," he said. "I should 
have gone to a JC because I wasn't ready for college. I didn't know you could 
go to a JC first. Nobody ever told me that in high school. It was like they 
were just concerned about what I did on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like, 'Arizona State can get you in even if you don't pass the 
(Scholastic Aptitude Test) test.' So I thought I'd just go there and get good 
grades, and it didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his academic problems at Arizona State, Russell said he was in a 
position to become eligible to play but chose to withdraw from the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to summer school and I would have had the 24 units I needed, but I 
was feeling down about the whole thing," he said. "I wasn't confident in 
myself, so I just sat down with my parents and decided to come home and get 
myself together." 
</P>
<P>
Russell said he has changed his priorities for college since attending Mt. San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"Before it was like 90% football and 10% academics and now it's 60% academics 
and 40% football," he said. "Football has always come easy to me. I've always 
been a good athlete, but academics has always come harder. Now I'll find myself 
practicing on the field for an hour or two and then I'll go home and study two 
or three hours." 
</P>
<P>
That is what convinces Russell that he made the right decision to leave Arizona 
State and attend Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I didn't know it, but looking back at what's happened at Arizona 
State and here at Mt. SAC, it's the best thing that could have happened," 
Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
It has also worked out for Russell as a member of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
Russell said the success of the team has been an added bonus considering the 
program's struggles in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of heard it around campus that Mt. SAC wasn't a good football 
team," he said. "But when I came in, three other coaches came in, and some good 
players from Pasadena came in and you could just see it turning around. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came in, coming from a high school like Long Beach Poly that won all 
the time, I just expected to win. But in the environment around me here, it 
just felt like a winning program, and we have won." 
</P>
<P>
Fisk said Russell has matured on the football field in the same manner that the 
program has developed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's matured a lot, and I think last year he got better with each game," Fisk 
said. "He's also been on a weight program and he's gotten stronger." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-2 and 226 pounds, Russell combines his 4.5-second speed in the 40-yard 
dash with exceptional strength. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tailback, but he can also block," Fisk said. "He's a big, strong guy, 
but he can run too. I think as the game goes on he wears people down, as most 
big backs will. By the fourth quarter, you can usually see the defenses 
dragging a little." 
</P>
<P>
It is Russell's strength that he says has improved the most since last season. 
In fact, he bench-presses 475 pounds and squats 550. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked real hard in the weight room and with my running ability this 
summer," he said. "Before, I didn't have an idea about the weights. It was 
foreign to me in high school. I feel much stronger and healthier on the field 
too." 
</P>
<P>
He said he also has improved vision on the field this season. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as my sight, I can see holes I wouldn't have seen last year and my wind 
is much better," Russell said. "I can carry 30 times because I'm much stronger 
than I was last year." 
</P>
<P>
That is why Russell thinks he can reach the 2,000-yard plateau this season. 
</P>
<P>
It is also why he has been recruited by most of the top college football 
programs in the nation for next season. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Russell says he is still more concerned about finishing the 
season and completing his class work at Mt. San Antonio this season. But he has 
set guidelines for what four-year school he will transfer to next season. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as trips go, I won't take any until after the season," he said. "I'll 
have only two years to play two seasons, so I want to go to a place where I can 
start and a place that runs 70% of the time and likes to throw out of the 
backfield. I'm not going to a school that runs the wishbone because that's not 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I also want to go to a school that pushes academics, a place where they care 
about whether you get your class work done. Everyone needs a push now and then 
in academics, and the people that do (push) are the ones that really care about 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Russell says there are a lot of people who never expected him to be saying that 
after he withdrew from Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought that I was going to quit," he said. "My mom heard that 
from a lot of people, so she told me to just make it. My parents (Leonard Sr. 
and Lillian) pushed me to succeed academically and on the field. Without them, 
I don't know what I'd do. They've kept their faith in me." 
</P>
<P>
Russell is proving every day that their faith was justified.

AZUSA PACIFIC AIMS TO EVEN ITS RECORD AGAINST LA VERNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific University football team will try to reach the .500 mark when 
it visits longtime rival La Verne at 1:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific enters the game with a 1-2 record and La Verne is 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars won their second game of the season, 29-0 over Cal Poly Pomona last 
week. But the game does not count in the standings because Pomona is a club 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa has been led on offense by its rushing attack that includes fullbacks 
Tommy Daniel and Jerrold Johnson and tailback James Brewer. Against Pomona, 
Brewer rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
One of the team's leaders on defense has been defensive back Mario Riveros, who 
has two interceptions and is also an excellent kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne, which defeated Whittier by a 23-19 score last week for its first win 
of the season, has been led by the passing of quarterback Mark Brown. The 
Leopards also have an outstanding pass-catching corps that includes wide 
receivers Lamont Landers and Anthony Grove and tight end John Kusleika. 
</P>
<P>
The Leopards, who had been struggling on defense, also turned in one of their 
top defensive efforts of the season against Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
In other games involving four-year colleges Saturday, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
(1-3) hosts Pomona-Pitzer (1-2) at 1:30 p.m. and Occidental (3-1) hosts the 
University of San Diego (5-0) at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Like La Verne, Claremont also won its first game of the season last week. But 
La Verne did not have to travel to San Antonio, Tex., where Claremont defeated 
Trinity by a 42-20 score. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont has been led on offense by the passing combination of quarterback 
Mike Pembroke and wide receiver Darin Carlsen. Pembroke completed eight of 14 
passes for 184 yards and four touchdowns against Trinity and Carlsen caught 
three passes for 77 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer suffered a 31-6 loss to San Diego last week. But the Sagehens 
have an outstanding running back in freshman Chris Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's soccer team, ranked No. 17 in the NCAA Division II, 
will make its longest road trip of the season when it plays three games in 
Colorado this week. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona faces Metro State (5-4) today in Denver. Then they travel to Greeley for 
two. They will face Northern Colorado (2-4-1) on Saturday and Missouri-St. 
Louis (8-3-1) on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who have a 3-6-1 record, will try to snap a two-game losing streak 
after losses to NCAA powers UC Santa Barbara (6-0) and UC San Diego (1-0). 
Santa Barbara was ranked No. 2 in Division I and San Diego finished second in 
Division III last year. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led by senior midfielder Melissa Rogers, who has two goals and 
seven points.

the end of the Long Beach (710) Freeway at Valley Boulevard in Alhambra have 
seen the answer to the question: What happens to old freeway signs? The section 
at the end of the freeway is used as a storage and salvage yard for signs with 
a disorienting array of destinations. When a new sign is needed, workers reuse 
the metal frames from signs that used to point the way to where things used to 
be. LOU MACK / Los Angeles Times

REST HOME CAN'T SUBDIVIDE LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIMAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has overturned a unanimous Planning Commission recommendation 
and rejected a retirement home's application to subdivide its property, saying 
the home could find itself landlocked if it ever needed to expand. 
</P>
<P>
The action pleased residents who showed up at Tuesday's meeting to protest the 
subdivision, saying they feared it would open the area to development. 
</P>
<P>
American Retirement Villas was seeking to divide its 18-acre property on the 
southwest corner of Cypress Street and Valley Center Avenue into a five-acre 
parcel that it would keep and a 13-acre parcel that it would sell. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Planning Commission approved the division. Neighborhood 
residents oppose the split, fearful that the imminent sale to developer Brian 
Barbuto would open the gates for a 47-house project, potentially disturbing a 
canyon and creek bed that are home to possums, quail, rabbits and woodpeckers. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided with a 4-0 vote that the smaller parcel did not meet 
parking, setback and open space standards, and thus the retirement home may 
need the remaining land. Mayor Terry Dipple did not participate in the 
discussion or vote because he is a consultant to Barbuto in development 
projects in other cities, including La Verne, West Covina and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a shoehorn job," said Councilman Curt Morris, referring to the 
retirement center's contention that five acres are adequate for its existing 
seven-story residential building, a two-story administration, dining and 
recreation building, and a planned minor enlargement of the parking area. "It 
just seems to me it's too tight." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Collins, assistant director of the Planning Department, told the council 
that the center would need at least another half an acre should it ever need to 
increase parking from 97 to 167 spaces to meet a requirement that is waived 
under its present conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
"Parking will never be a problem because of the type of elderly person that we 
house," said John Jason, executive vice president of Costa Mesa-based American 
Retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He later said using the parking issue as a justification for denying the lot 
split was ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
"They want one space per bedroom for a facility where people don't drive," he 
said, adding that he has not decided what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
Barbuto had submitted an application to the city for a 54-home development at 
the site in February but later withdrew it because of resident opposition and 
because the city is in the process of updating its General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The draft plan is expected to come before the council early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents pleaded with the council Monday to protect the wilderness area 
behind their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the seven-story (retirement) building was minimized by 18 acres 
that are wild and rustic," said Carla Damrill, a member of Save Our Rural 
Environment, a group of residents on the canyon's southern edge who oppose any 
building in the canyon. "That's why we're living here." 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Damrill said she hears coyotes in the night and has watched 
raccoons bathe in her hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
"We have quail in our back yard," said John Boyadjian, a resident on the north 
side of the canyon. "Let's just leave a little bit of space and keep the 
wildlife there, so we can show our kids what was there before we destroyed the 
area."

Kids grab the fishing spotlight this week. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Sanderson of Harbor City and his 13-year-old son, Kevin, launched their 
skiff at Cabrillo Beach, picked up a scoop of anchovies and headed out to the 
oil rigs for a day of perch fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Using light rods and 15-pound test line, the bite was on, and within an hour 
the pair was two fish short of a limit. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson set down his rod and started to clean the catch. 
</P>
<P>
With no bait remaining, Kevin continued to fish, inserting cut squid to a lead 
head jig and made several casts. He got a strike, set the hook and the fish 
spooled him. 
</P>
<P>
The fish started to move out. As Kevin tried to gain line with it the skiff 
drifted faster. Sanderson thought it could be a shark or big bat ray. Kevin 
refused to give the rod to his father. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later a yellowtail surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
A net was lowered but the yellow was too big. Kevin held on although his arm 
was weakening. Another small boat that was watching nearby moved in and helped 
put the fish aboard the waiting skiff. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin said it was the largest fish he ever caught as he posed, all smiles, with 
his 27 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Lagrande, 11, of Long Beach was fishing for marlin aboard the Wicked Ways 
with his father, Ron, when he hooked his first marlin off Avalon bank. 
</P>
<P>
Alex, who has a hearing impairment, was instructed by sign language and worked 
the big marlin for 35 minutes before it came to gaff. The marlin was weighed in 
at Avalon at 169 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica from Long Beach Sportfishing got into the marlin action over the 
weekend at Catalina Island. 
</P>

LOS ANGELES MAY JOIN PANEL OVERSEEING CLEANUP OF UP MONTEREY PARK LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A Los Angeles City Council committee recommended Tuesday that the city's 
Department of Water and Power join an industry-run committee that is cleaning 
up the Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation, expected to be considered by the full council later this 
month, would make the department the only municipal agency on the 82-member 
committee. The committee was set up several years ago by companies identified 
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as "potentially responsible" for 
contamination at the landfill, which has been designated a federal Superfund 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The 190-acre dump, bisected by the Pomona Freeway, opened in 1948 and accepted 
liquid hazardous waste as well as municipal trash until it was closed in 1984 
amid complaints about odors, the accumulation of landfill gas and other 
environmental problems. In 1986, the dump was placed on the national priority 
list for cleanup under the Superfund program, which makes companies and 
agencies liable for the hazardous waste they generate even after they have 
legally disposed of it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DWP Used Dump 
</P>
<P>
The DWP allegedly dumped hazardous liquid waste at the landfill, although the 
department has not acknowledged liability for the pollution problem there. DWP 
spokeswoman Mindy Berman said the department disposed of 700,000 gallons of 
"water with some oil in it" from steam plants and other facilities. She said 
the DWP waste accounted for a fraction of the total liquid waste at the 
landfill, estimated at 200 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Tuesday before the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee, an attorney for the DWP said the city would face a battle 
with the EPA if the department does not join the so-called Operating Industries 
Landfill Steering Committee. The department would pay $49,250 to join the 
committee, with other costs through the end of December expected to total 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The EPA has told us they will not deal with us as a separate entity," said 
Deputy City Atty. Roberta Zinman. "They only wish to deal with the steering 
committee. It appears there will be no secondary group." 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council panel, the City Administrative Office said joining 
the committee was financially wise because the admission fee would be less than 
the cost of drilling one test hole at the landfill and the related laboratory 
expenses. The steering committee is expected to drill two dozen monitoring 
wells at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, taking everything into consideration, it would be a lot 
cheaper and probably a lot more effective to join the organization than 
fighting on our own," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who heads the 
three-member council panel which unanimously approved the DWP request to join 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 120 companies and government agencies agreed to pay a total 
of $66 million to help clean up the dump, with the DWP's contribution exceeding 
$440,000. At that time, Daniel W. McGovern, regional administrator of the EPA, 
described the dump as "one of the most complex and contaminated sites in the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
The landfill has been plagued with problems involving the migration of landfill 
gas into surrounding neighborhoods, emissions of gases containing vinyl 
chloride and other harmful substances, and the accumulation of leachate, which 
is landfill water contaminated with chemicals. In May, the EPA agreed to 
gradually hand over the job of cleaning up and monitoring the landfill to the 
steering committee, which is scheduled to take full control of the job within 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The steering committee, through contractors and consultants, is expected to 
expand the system for monitoring, collecting and burning landfill gas at the 
dump. It has already agreed to improve irrigation and erosion control at the 
site and collect and haul away leachate. The group will also design and 
construct a plant to treat leachate at the site. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials have estimated that the cleanup cost could reach $200 million to 
$300 million. The City Administrative Office estimated in its report that the 
cleanup could total $1 billion.

EAST GERMANS CONCEDE REFORMS ARE NEEDED; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: THE BELEAGUERED HARD-LINE POLITBURO CHANGES ITS TONE AND WILL DISCUSS 
'ALL BASIC QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.' 
</P>

<P>
East Germany's ruling Politburo, in a startlingly high-level change of tone, 
conceded Wednesday night that reforms are needed in the Communist state, which 
has been racked by demonstrations and the recent flight of thousands of its 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo said in a special statement that "together, we want to discuss 
all basic questions of our society." The statement was read over East German 
television and distributed simultaneously by the official news agency ADN. 
</P>
<P>
It came after a long Politburo meeting Tuesday night that continued into 
Wednesday morning, at which the regime's leadership reportedly came under heavy 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
It also came after sharp remarks by the party's chief ideologist, Kurt Hager, 
who argued that policy changes are necessary in the hard-line Communist 
country. Hager, 77, spoke out Sunday in an interview with the Soviet news 
agency Novosti, after a two-day visit to East Germany by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. His remarks were published widely Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that East German policy regarding the news media must be revamped 
and that ordinary people must be drawn somehow into the policy-making process. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a senior East German official had publicly 
recognized the refugee crisis. He admitted that "too many obstacles have been 
put in the way of youth" and that "something needs to be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
There were reports that lower-level Communist Party officials in 20 districts 
of East Germany have demanded that the government discuss the problems with the 
people and that local talks were already under way in some districts. 
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the ADN reported abruptly and without explanation that East 
German leader Erich Honecker has canceled an official visit to Denmark 
scheduled for Oct. 25-26. 
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an East German diplomat in Copenhagen as saying only that "we 
think it would be better to have the visit at a later date." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers speculated that the cancellation could be due to the health 
of Honecker, 77, who reportedly has not recovered from the effects of a 
gallbladder operation. 
</P>
<P>
But they also suggested that major political developments might be in the 
making and that Honecker may not wish to be away from East Berlin at a critical 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo statement, referring to the thousands of East Germans who have 
recently fled to the West, said: 
</P>
<P>
"They had a homeland that needed them and that they needed. The causes for 
their decision may be many. We must and will look for them here, everyone in 
their place, everyone together." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist leaders agreed that among the questions that need to be aired are 
economic efficiency, consumer goods, a freer news media, foreign travel and 
democratic cooperation. They said that such matters will be discussed at the 
next meeting of the larger Central Committee, which usually meets in late 
autumn but may meet earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo insisted, however, that any dialogue with the people will not 
involve the essence of the socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow the power of the workers and peasants, the values, ideals 
and achievements of socialism to be infringed upon," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, East Germany has seen thousands of its young people flee 
to West Germany and thousands of others take part in massive but nonviolent 
street demonstrations in its major cities, calling for reform and more 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations came at the time of the country's 40th anniversary 
celebration and were the largest since the workers' uprising of 1953, which was 
suppressed with Soviet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Hager, in the interview with Novosti, said the time is right for reform. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he said, "it is necessary to draw up a clear-cut concept. But 
the will is there, and I believe we will succeed in bringing about the 
necessary renewals. We have discussed our achievements, but now it is necessary 
to talk about what is needed to change and renew in the run-up to (next year's) 
party congress." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what sort of changes are needed, he said: "It is possible to perfect 
everything. There are many such questions -- for instance, the more active 
involvement of the population in deciding on social problems and the 
improvement of information policy." 
</P>
<P>
Another Communist party official, Herrmann Kant, said in a letter to the 
Communist party youth organ, Junge Welt, that "clearer and better " press 
reports are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic analysts said the emphasis on the press suggests that the man in 
charge of the Ministry for Agitation and Propaganda, Joachim Herrmann, is being 
discredited and may be blamed for the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, the Politburo and the official news media had taken a severe 
line, arguing that no reforms were necessary and that the demonstrations were 
the work of thugs and "hooligans." According to this line, the people who fled 
the country are traitors. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, the trade union daily Tribune quoted popular actress Ursula 
Werner as expressing concern about life in East Germany and the unrealistic way 
it has been described in the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, there has been a great loss of confidence that worries us," 
she said, and she pressed for free discussion of political and economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
One of the groups urging reform is New Forum, which in three weeks has obtained 
more than 10,000 signatures on a statement of principles but has been 
proscribed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Rolf Henrich, a New Forum founder, told West German Radio it is 
too early to ask people to suspend the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way is for the dialogue to begin," he said, "and if it really 
proceeds in a credible way, the streets will clear of protests." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Politburo issued its statement, the official Communist party 
newspaper Neues Deutschland accused West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl of 
"flagrant interference" in urging East German leaders to undertake reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"We will solve our problems alone, not with Kohl's recipes but with socialist 
methods, in a socialist fashion, to further strengthen socialism," Neues 
Deutschland said in a commentary. "Any demands and recommendations which in 
reality aim at weakening or abolishing socialism will bear no fruit here."

LAWMAKERS IN FLORIDA REJECT ABORTION LIMITS 
</P>

<P>
Abortion rights advocates scored a resounding victory and Florida's Gov. Bob 
Martinez suffered an embarrassing defeat Wednesday when the state Legislature 
swiftly killed the last of his attempts to build on a U.S. Supreme Court 
decision allowing tighter restrictions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the lessons from Florida will be taken into account by other governors 
and state legislatures across the country," pro-choice leader Kate Michelman 
declared shortly after the Democratic-run Legislature had spent barely more 
than a day burying all four proposals pressed by the Republican governor in a 
special session. 
</P>
<P>
"Elected officials are catching up with the people on the question of freedom 
of conscience," said Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion 
Rights Action League. "And they are recognizing that the bark of the 
anti-choice minority is louder than its bite." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and leaders of anti-abortion groups bitterly disagreed, charging that 
partisan maneuvers to kill legislation in committee had prevented the full 
Senate and House from enacting, at a minimum, stronger regulation of abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Senate and House committees decisively rejected a clinic control bill 
Wednesday. An effort was made later to have the full Senate consider it, but a 
bipartisan 22-18 vote in favor of the move fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
"The Florida Legislature is incredibly cynical," said Ken Connor, president of 
Florida Right to Life. "And I think you are going to see an outpouring of 
outrage so profound in other states that they will look very hard and try to 
avoid that kind of thing there." 
</P>
<P>
The brief legislative session was marked by emotional outpourings from both 
sides. Police estimated that 10,000 abortion rights demonstrators and 7,000 
anti-abortion demonstrators had converged on the Capitol at the start of the 
special session. 
</P>
<P>
The session had been scheduled to last up to four days but ended just 27 hours 
after it started when all of the governor's proposed legislation had been 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez denied that he had been hurt politically by the futile session, which 
he called last July shortly after the Supreme Court upheld a restrictive 
Missouri law and opened the way for other states to adopt abortion curbs. 
</P>
<P>
Many GOP legislators pleaded with him to abandon the session after public 
opinion polls ran strongly against it -- and after the Florida Supreme Court 
ruled last week that Florida's right-to-privacy law gave broad protection to 
women choosing to terminate a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I stood for my convictions," Martinez said. "I don't think people in 
any state have an adverse feeling toward someone who stands up on a matter of 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
However, in an extraordinary move, moderate Republican Sen. Marlene 
Woodson-Howard announced during the session that she would challenge Martinez 
in his bid to win reelection to a second term next year. She voted against 
three of his proposals in a Senate committee and offered a watered-down version 
of his clinic regulation bill. 
</P>
<P>
Besides seeking strengthened regulation of clinics, Martinez proposed to ban 
most abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, to prohibit abortions at 
public hospitals and to require that those seeking abortions be informed of the 
condition of the fetus and the risks of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion clinic measure, far less stringent than an Illinois law now being 
reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, was supported even by some pro-choice 
legislators who were appalled by a recent Miami Herald expose describing 
botched abortions at a Florida clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was rejected despite graphic testimony by state investigators who, 
responding to the newspaper report, had raided 16 clinics in recent weeks and 
found conditions "shocking" enough to close three and further probe five 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Coler, secretary of the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative 
Services, said a Miami clinic had an unlicensed physician, no toilet, no hot 
water and cockroach poison in a room where surgical instruments were 
sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
Another clinic's doctor paid a bonus if personnel could get the patient to opt 
for "the more expensive type of anesthesia," he told the Senate Health Care 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I have really been shocked," said Connie Sheren, the state licensing 
director who displayed photographs of clinics she had investigated while posing 
as an abortion customer. 
</P>
<P>
Coler, claiming that the legality of the raids was clouded by a 1982 federal 
court ruling, appealed for more authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion leaders, seeking to salvage something from the session, made a 
last-ditch effort to pass a stripped-down regulation bill. But Democratic 
leaders, originally inclined toward such a deal, spurned it after pro-choice 
groups protested that making any concession to Martinez and anti-abortion 
groups might deprive them of momentum in other states. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection infuriated Rosemary Gallagher of the Florida Catholic Conference, 
who told the Senate committee: "In your hands lies the ability to protect the 
women of this state from exploitation by these clinics. The blood of these 
women will not be on the hands of the pro-life movement." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Rep. Elaine Gordon, one of three women committee heads who 
spearheaded defeat of the Martinez bills, said the Legislature probably would 
tighten regulations in a regular session, after the Supreme Court has ruled on 
the Illinois law and lawmakers have had more time to consider the matter. 
</P>
<P>
But she said the Legislature responded to the grass-roots fury of women who 
suddenly realize that their right to abortion, legalized by the Supreme Court 
in 1972, is threatened by the court's Missouri ruling last July. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely the awakening of the sleeping giant," she said. "And I 
think in many other states it is possible to waken the sleeping giants there as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion forces, badly beaten in Florida, hope to turn things around in 
Pennsylvania, where the state Legislature has begun considering a batch of 
restrictive measures. Abortion-rights supporters appear to be outnumbered, but 
they are fighting back with a new opinion poll, which they say shows that 
legislators are out of step with Pennsylvania voters. They promised to target 
anti-abortion candidates in the state's elections next year.

SIPAN, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1602, Spanish settlers diverted the Moche River to make the waters eat away 
an ancient adobe pyramid and bare its riches. They found stunning treasures 
from an earlier Indian empire and, as was common practice, melted down the 
artifacts for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, after three decades of pick-and-shovel looting in hundreds of 
thousands of graves in the Batan Grande burial ground, labor-intensive 
techniques gave way to mechanized robbery. Hacienda owners brought in 
bulldozers to move the earth and get at the gold. The objects nurtured private 
collections and museums in Peru and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
One night in mid-September, armed looters tried to raid an archeological site 
in the village of Sipan that has yielded probably the most extraordinary tomb 
ever discovered intact in the Americas. A gun battle broke out as guards drove 
off the attackers from the Moche Kingdom burial mound. 
</P>
<P>
That was a rare victory in a region of uncounted, unguarded pyramids and 
graveyards covering a 200-mile stretch of desert coast in northern Peru. More 
typical was the scene a few hundred yards from the Sipan excavation on a recent 
Sunday afternoon: Grave robbers, unmolested, were digging yet another pit in a 
time-worn cemetery that fills the floor of a mystical valley. 
</P>
<P>
As the worldwide market for pre-Columbian artifacts surged in the 1950s, 
questions arose over the moral aspects of the trade, especially the looting 
that it prompts and the resulting havoc at archeological sites. The terms used 
suggest the tenor of the dispute: Archeologists excavate, grave robbers dig. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular discovery here, announced a year ago, and an intricate 
controversy engulfing it, have brought the issue of commerce in Peru's cultural 
heritage into international focus. After spreading beyond Peru's borders to a 
federal court in Los Angeles, the dispute is likely to prompt an emergency 
ruling by President Bush before the year ends, banning the import of the looted 
riches of the Moche Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
But this is no black-and-white case of saving the artifacts of 3,000 years of 
successive civilizations from greedy predators. At issue are the traditions of 
looting, the economic motives behind it, the legacy of corruption and neglect 
in Peru and the often conflicting interests of archeologists, museums, 
collectors and dealers, honorable and otherwise. At bottom, it is a wrenching 
debate over how nations where ancient civilizations once flourished can best 
explore and preserve their past. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, the National Geographic Society sponsored a news conference 
in Washington to disclose the discovery of the tomb of "the Lord of Sipan." 
Peruvian archeologist Walter Alva had found an exquisite grave of a leader of 
the Moche, a pre-Incan people who dominated the river valleys along the coast 
from about AD 100 to 700. 
</P>
<P>
In the continuing excavation funded by National Geographic, Alva and his 
assistant, Luis Chero, in July found yet another intact tomb in the same burial 
mound, a rectangular lump of adobe bricks in the shadow of a pyramid, both 
pockmarked from years of prospecting. 
</P>
<P>
Workers are painstakingly removing the layers of oxidized copper objects that 
cover the corpse, dubbed Spiderman. While the find appears less dramatic than 
the Lord of Sipan's tomb, Alva has already extracted a magnificent gold 
necklace made of spiders with human faces on their backs, poised on spiraling 
webs spun from thin gold filament stretched over palm-sized gold bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Alva is working the site only because looters found it first, in startling 
fashion. Funded by a local family, a team of grave robbers dug with skill and 
caution for two months in late 1986, and found what actually may have been the 
richest tomb in the burial mound. A substantial number of objects were sold, 
then police arrested several people and shot one fatally in a confused 
confrontation that still festers in the village. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best looted pieces are on display in a private collection in Lima, 
which infuriates Alva. Others were allegedly smuggled to Europe. Some made 
their way back from Europe to Los Angeles, where a few were seized by U.S. 
Customs, thanks to an informer and wire-taps. But many items have vanished into 
the clandestine world of illegal trading in pre-Columbian art. 
</P>
<P>
Learning of the looters' find, Alva came from the nearby town of Lambayeque, 
where he is director of an archeological museum called the Bruning, to 
investigate. He slept at the burial mound at night, armed, and chased away 
scavengers as the work proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
Four-man police units armed with machine pistols now guard the site. Out of the 
thousands of huacas, or ruins, of sacred places from Moche and other kingdoms 
along the coast, Sipan is one of a handful that is protected from the huaqueros 
(looters). As the recent raid demonstrated, even the police guard could not 
deter an armed attack. 
</P>
<P>
In the abject village of Sipan that abuts the burial mound known as Huaca 
Rajada, many of the several hundred families are bitter. These descendants of 
the civilization that built the tomb complain that they are now denied a piece 
of the action. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Alva didn't find that tomb, the huaqueros found it," said Ismael Piedra 
Effeo, a 30-year-old sometime handicrafts seller, artifacts buyer and Sunday 
huaquero himself. "They may have titles as archeologists, but we know more in 
practice. We know early Chavin from classical Chavin artifacts, we know Moche I 
from Moche III and Moche V (phases). This is our own culture." 
</P>
<P>
He mused about the site's lore: "They say the man who found it dreamed that the 
huaca was there. There had been a light over the huaca, and people heard a band 
playing music there at night. Years ago a girl went mad there. She was 13. She 
died a while later. She said the spirits were calling her." 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Bernal, 36, whose brother was killed by police over the loot, and three 
of whose family members were convicted in the case, scoffed: "Alva the great 
discover! He sits behind a desk and waits for people to find things and have 
them fall on his desk." 
</P>
<P>
Alva, a jovial, bearded man who is from the region and has devoted more than a 
decade to digs and to the Bruning Museum, has in fact made a number of finds of 
his own, but he acknowledges that such comments reflect the tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an economic crisis. We have vague laws. The traffickers go free. 
People say, 'Alva is the biggest huaquero.'" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he claimed progress in getting residents to understand that the 
archeologists seek not treasure but information -- how the Moche lived, what 
they believed, how they worshiped, why they disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, we were lucky if we had two visitors each afternoon (at the 
Bruning Museum); it was a big event. The staff would come to me and say, 
'People are here!' " he recalled in his office. Raising his arm toward the 
now-crowded display rooms, rebuilt a few years back, he added, "There is an 
awakening now of awareness in the region." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the sackings have increased in the area since the Sipan find, and "we have 
the absurd situation where 600 meters (656 yards) from our site, people are 
looting while we are excavating. We go out with the police, but the next day 
they are back. There is almost a tacit agreement that we are letting people 
sack some of the richest archeological lodes in America." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the loot is abundant, or appears to be. In the old central market in 
Chiclayo, stalls offer an array of pre-Incan artifacts, most of them obvious 
copies, alongside the herbs used in faith-healing ceremonies that have survived 
from ancient times. 
</P>
<P>
One dealer spied a browser surveying the pots and copper-work and murmured, "I 
also have genuine items." Inviting the visitor behind the counter, he opened a 
drawer and brought out several handsome pots. An archeologist pointed out that 
most of those, too, were fake, but several were real. 
</P>
<P>
The huaqueros range from poor villagers on weekends -- and especially Easter 
Weekend when they believe the souls leave the cemeteries -- to well-financed 
criminal teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The huaqueros wage a saturation war. It's like dropping 20 bombs to kill a 
single enemy," Alva said. "The huaquero tries 100 times, and hits one tomb, but 
over time that is effective." 
</P>
<P>
The long-term solution, he said, is similar to that in Peru's anti-drug war: 
reduce demand, both in the capital, Lima, and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment that people stop buying, the occasional huaqueros will stop. The 
few professionals will continue. They have capital, they can afford to go a 
long time without finding anything." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners among archeologists reject any suggestion that they work with 
the huaqueros rather than fight them. They argue that the goal must not be 
merely to find the ceramics and gold objects but to learn where they came from 
and to investigate every aspect of the site, even the refuse, to discover who 
the people were and how they lived. 
</P>
<P>
While the painted and sculpted pottery and jewelry of the Moche leave a rich 
record, the people had no writing system to offer details about their beliefs 
and practices. Given the ravages of the looting and the Moches' mysterious 
disappearance 1,300 years ago, they are lesser known than the later Incas, 
although greater artists by far. 
</P>
<P>
If the government encouraged looting by offering to buy rather than seize 
artifacts, many archeologists say, there would be a flood of loot but no 
knowledge of where it came from and its context. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, though, some archeologists wonder whether it is time to face the 
reality of the huaqueros and even exploit their skills. The huaqueros 
themselves, and their local middlemen, certainly endorse that view. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Garcia Cacho, a 69-year-old father of 17 in the nearby town of Zana, 
has dealt in looted objects since the 1950s. He displayed to an American 
visitor an array of his recent purchases, including bowls, pots, necklaces and 
beads, and allowed that they could be obtained for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be the first to sell to the government if it was possible, to avoid 
the flight of these things from Peru," he said. "We don't do this to get rich, 
but to get by. The amount of sacking depends on the economy. If there is work, 
nobody is looting." 
</P>
<P>
James Vreeland, an American anthropologist who runs a travel agency offering 
archeology tours of the area, said much of the looting is a way of adapting to 
Peru's growing economic stress. 
</P>
<P>
"The contemporary inheritors of this culture see the huacas as a bank account 
left by their ancestors, to be drawn on in times of need," he said. "The same 
is true for the collectors, who see their gold as a security deposit for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Vreeland, from the district's provincial capital, Chiclayo, said that only in 
the 1950s did the value of the objects themselves begin to exceed that of their 
often minimal gold content. Then the looting really boomed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody loots; it's part of Peruvian cultural tradition," he said. "We see 
it as a scourge, but there is no force of order out there to fall back on. The 
solution? That the huaqueros become the first line of defense in protecting the 
sites, that they become involved in the process with the archeologists." 
</P>
<P>
Johan Reinhard, a veteran American anthropologist in Latin America, cited one 
major obstacle: "Money. There's no money for the archeologists, for buying 
objects, for controlling the sites." 
</P>
<P>
He tells of a friend in Nazca, south of Lima, who raced to police to advise of 
looters, only to be told: "You pay for our gasoline, and we'll go after them." 
</P>
<P>
The archeologists and government officials tend to save their loudest 
complaints for the dealers and collectors in Lima and especially overseas. But 
here, too, there are complicating subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
Enrico Poli, an eloquent collector, lives in a unprepossessing house in a Lima 
suburb. But when he opens the door to a visitor for a $50 tour, a startling 
world of pre-Columbian and colonial art beckons. Poli's collection is arguably 
among the finest anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Before Alva even learned of the looting at Sipan, Poli says, he had bought 
about 200 objects from the first scavenged tomb. Poli insists the looters found 
by far the richest lode and that Alva's Lord of Sipan is a poor cousin. Poli 
recalls the huaqueros' description: "The gold came up to their knees." They 
carried it away by the sackful. 
</P>
<P>
Poli was allowed to register his Sipan pieces with the National Institute of 
Culture, to the puzzlement of many, since legitimate acquisition is normally a 
requirement. The registration prevents him from selling the items but lets him 
possess them. 
</P>
<P>
The registry was designed as the guardian of cultural assets. But it is 
infamously disorganized, and the institute itself is scorned for doing little 
to prevent grave-robbing, illegal at least since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
Poli and other dealers fret about government suggestions that all private 
pre-Columbian collections might be nationalized. He worries, too, that his 
Sipan works will be seized, and may try to hide them. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutor Julio Ubilluz, responsible for handling the 400 or so 
cases involving grave-robbing and smuggling, said Poli is under investigation 
for the Sipan items, even though the cultural institute has registered them. 
</P>
<P>
Ubilluz said the government believes another set of Sipan gold objects is 
floating around Lima, hidden for fear of seizure. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed law that would consolidate and simplify the rules on pre-conquest 
patrimony has been debated for four years. Peru has had 251 laws and rules 
affecting these objects, Ubilluz said. A judge in Los Angeles ruled against a 
Peruvian attempt to reclaim some objects in part because of the law's 
vagueness, even while expressing sympathy for Peru's plight. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the legal disarray, Peru's government has been criticized for 
failing to act aggressively while expecting foreign governments to crack down 
on trafficking. Only last June, more than two years after the Sipan looting, 
did the government formally request the United States to impose an emergency 
order, under a 1983 U.S. law, that would restrict imports of Sipan or all Moche 
artifacts. A commission is studying the request, and President Bush is expected 
to approve it in November. That would reduce the burden on Peru to prove if and 
when the works were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Ubilluz said control is improving, and the government also is attempting to 
raise awareness of the problem. New high school textbooks this year include a 
chapter on Peru's archeological treasures and the need to preserve them. 
</P>
<P>
"What is in the hands of the collectors is tiny compared to what is still in 
the ground," he said. "We are more concerned with that." 
</P>
<P>
But after touring the northern coastal districts, where virtually no site 
appears undisturbed, it is hard to accept that 450 years of non-stop looting 
has left many tombs untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Alva said that the best stolen items remain for only a few hours before moving 
to foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
Given that exodus, Poli contends: "You shouldn't shout at the person who is 
keeping this art in Peru. I didn't smuggle it. . . . I prefer to keep in the 
country what otherwise would flee. If it weren't for me, where would the masks 
and the golden peanut shells be? In Boston? Vancouver?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the string of gold peanut-shell beads, a ruler's scepter and other 
treasure from Sipan are lovingly displayed in a vault-like annex that he has 
constructed in his back garden. Poli said he might give them to the national 
museum. Meanwhile, he notes with a smile that a tourist recently called him 
"the living Lord of Sipan."

USE OF ABORTION FUNDS EXPANDED; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: A VOTE IN THE HOUSE TO ASSIST VICTIMS OF RAPE AND INCEST MARKS A 
DRAMATIC AND SURPRISING TURNABOUT IN POLICY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic policy turnabout that gave abortion-rights forces an important 
symbolic victory but risked a presidential veto, the House on Wednesday 
narrowly approved using public funds to provide abortions for victims of rape 
and incest. 
</P>
<P>
The House, acting on back-to-back roll-call votes of 216 to 206 and 212 to 207, 
voted to broaden a provision approved every year since 1981 that permits 
government funding of abortions only when the life of the mother is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Already endorsed by the Senate, the expanded funding was approved as part of a 
$156.7-billion appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and 
Human Services. The bill now must return to the Senate for what is expected to 
be routine approval. Then it will be sent to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Since the provision was reaffirmed by the House only a year ago by a margin of 
50 votes, the outcome of Wednesday's emotional debate surprised the winners as 
much as the losers. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we have an historic moment -- a change in direction," said Rep. Barbara 
Boxer (D-Greenbrae), leader of the victorious challengers on an issue that had 
become a litmus test for organizations opposed to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), author of the original restriction, said that he 
expects President Bush to veto the bill because it expands abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration tried but failed to prevent the adoption of Boxer's proposal 
and a similar provision in another appropriations bill for the District of 
Columbia, which Bush also has threatened to veto. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made no public comment on the measure after Wednesday's vote, but senior 
advisers recommended that he veto it, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
While the President opposes abortion except in cases involving threats to a 
mother's life, rape or incest, he would use federal funds to pay for the 
procedure only in the case of abortions needed to save a woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, he sent a letter to Congress saying that he would veto a measure 
appropriating federal funds to pay for abortions other than those in which a 
continued pregnancy would threaten the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
While abortion-rights groups would find it difficult to get the necessary 
two-thirds vote to override a veto, supporters of the change said that a Bush 
veto would risk a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"The political momentum on this issue is so strong that he'd be making a big 
political mistake," Boxer told reporters after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a stalwart of the anti-abortion 
movement, declared: "I think we're feeling the weight of the 
multibillion-dollar abortion industry." 
</P>
<P>
New members of Congress and switches of position by some old members apparently 
accounted for the unexpected turnabout on the limited use of Medicaid funds for 
abortions in cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Democrats and five Republicans who voted against funding abortions in 
rape and incest cases in 1988 switched positions in Wednesday's vote, according 
to an analysis provided by Boxer's office. Of 38 new members, 20 voted for the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Among Californians, for example, Reps. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), Douglas 
H. Bosco (D-Occidental), Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) and Al 
McCandless (R-Bermuda Dunes) switched their positions and voted in favor of 
expanded funding. Also, Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Palo Alto), a new member, voted 
for the change. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the change acknowledged that it allowed only a small exception to 
the general ban on the use of Medicaid or other federal funds for abortions, 
but they said that the victory was a sign of changing times. 
</P>
<P>
In part, they said, the Supreme Court's decision last July that gave states 
more power to curb abortions has galvanized organizations and individuals who 
favor allowing women to choose whether to have an abortion or not. 
</P>
<P>
"The pro-choice activists are taking names -- there are no more free votes for 
the anti-abortion position," said Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.), a leader in the 
struggle to reduce the restriction against use of Medicaid funds for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's vote is a change from our high-water mark of 166 votes on an identical 
motion last year," AuCoin said. "It shows how far the pro-choice organizations 
have moved." Hyde said that the arrival of new members was the major factor in 
the turnaround. Even so, he said that it had to be considered a setback for the 
anti-abortion position in the House, traditionally a bulwark of the national 
anti-abortion movement compared to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
He also acknowledged that opponents of the "Hyde Amendment" restrictions now 
are more vocal, in part because of the Supreme Court's ruling. But he said that 
he expects the more stringent restriction to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted twice on the issue for parliamentary reasons. First, Boxer 
moved that the House recede from the position it took in a Senate-House 
conference to deny funding in cases of rape or incest. That motion succeeded by 
a 216-206 vote. On that roll call, 175 Democrats and 41 Republicans prevailed 
over 134 Republicans and 72 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Then a roll call was demanded on Boxer's motion to concur with a 
Senate-approved proposal to make Medicaid funds available in these exceptional 
cases. It passed by a 212-207 vote. There were 173 Democrats and 39 Republicans 
on the winning side, compared to 136 Republicans and 71 Democrats in the 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
Debate on the funding issue was emotional. Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) said 
that it would be wrong for the House to turn its back on victims of rape and 
incest and tell them, in effect: "You have not suffered enough so we are going 
to force you to bear a child that was conceived in hatred and violence." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Hyde said that the government should not provide tax funds 
for "killing, execution, extermination" of unborn babies. "I bleed for women 
who are raped and are victims of incest," he said. "They deserve our love. . . 
. But don't kill the innocent" by authorizing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE VOTE 
</P>
<P>
All but three members of the California delegation voted along party lines when 
the House approved, on a 216-206 vote, an amendment to allow welfare abortions 
for rape and incest victims. The 27 Democrats voted for the amendment, while 15 
Republicans voted against it. The three Republicans who voted for the amendment 
were Tom Campbell, Al McCandless and Bill Thomas.

IMMUNOLOGY: EXPERIMENTS THAT DEFUSE THE BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM SHOW PROMISE IN 
TREATING AND EVEN PREVENTING DISEASES LIKE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND DIABETES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A broad series of experiments suggest that it may be possible to defuse the 
immune system in humans to treat and even prevent diseases like multiple 
sclerosis and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Oregon and San Diego independently report they have used a 
synthetic molecule to immunize mice against an autoimmune disease -- in which 
the body's own immune system attacks its host -- that is widely used as a model 
for multiple sclerosis. Clinical trials of the approach could be undertaken in 
humans within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, researchers at Harvard are already using special antibodies in humans 
in an attempt to knock out MS patients' own antibodies that are producing the 
disease. Stanford researchers are preparing to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard researchers are also vaccinating some MS patients with immune cells 
in an attempt to protect them from the ravages of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great excitement about extending these (animal) efforts to humans," 
said neurologist Dale McFarland of the National Institutes of Health in 
Bethesda, Md. "We need things to get excited about. It's good for the patients 
to know that there are a lot of people still trying." 
</P>
<P>
MS is a paralyzing neurological disease that affects as many as 250,000 people 
in the United States. It usually strikes in young adulthood and lasts for the 
remainder of the victim's life, often 20 to 30 years. There is no effective 
treatment, although many patients go through long periods of spontaneous 
remission. 
</P>
<P>
The disease occurs when the victim's immune system goes awry and attacks the 
insulating protein sheath that surrounds nerve cells, effectively 
short-circuiting nerve impulses and producing the disease's characteristic 
symptoms: weakness, tremors, disturbances of speech and vision, and ultimately 
paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
In rodents and some other animals, an MS-like disease called experimental 
allergic encephalitis (EAE) can be produced by injecting the animals with 
ground-up nerve tissue. In an overreaction to the injected tissues, the 
animals' immune systems begin to attack their own nerve tissues, producing MS 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The attack is carried out by immune cells, called T cells, that normally 
proliferate in response to an infection and destroy the foreign invader. In MS, 
some of the person's immune cells inexplicably attack the nerve cells' 
insulating sheaths. 
</P>
<P>
MS researchers in the past have used drugs that wipe out all T cells in an 
attempt to halt the progression of MS, but such drugs leave the MS patient 
highly susceptible to life-threatening infections. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of most research now is to deactivate only those specific T cells that 
are attacking the nerve sheath while leaving the rest of the immune system 
intact. The two major -- and complementary -- ways of doing this are called 
active and passive immunization. 
</P>
<P>
In passive immunization, the researchers attack the T cells that have already 
been formed. If, for example, they know which specific type of T cell is 
attacking neural sheaths in EAE, the animal form of MS, they can produce 
special antibodies, called monoclonal antibodies, that bind to the T cells and 
help destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
Several researchers have shown that monoclonal antibodies can slow and even 
reverse the progress of EAE, as well as diabetes, in mice and rats. Neurologist 
Howard L. Weiner and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in Boston have used such antibodies to treat about 20 human MS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
In their safety trials, they have shown that the antibodies suppress the 
functioning of the T cells thought to be involved in MS, but they are not yet 
sure if they produced any remission of the disease because MS often goes into 
remission spontaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Neurologist Lawrence Steinman of the Stanford University Medical Center is 
planning to begin similar trials soon. 
</P>
<P>
In an active approach, such as that reported today in the journal Nature, the 
researchers hope to prevent the formation of the destructive T cells in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation for this approach was laid by immunologist Irun Cohen of the 
Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. For 10 years, Cohen has been isolating 
from rodents the T cells that cause EAE, diabetes and arthritis, treating them 
with radiation or chemicals to deactivate them so they do not cause harm, and 
injecting them back into the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The immune system produced antibodies against the injected T cells -- and thus 
against the identical T cells produced by the animals' bodies. These antibodies 
hold the T cells in check and thereby block progression of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner has already tried this approach in three human patients, isolating T 
cells from spinal fluid, deactivating them, and reinjecting them. As was the 
case with the monoclonal antibodies, the injections suppressed the undesired 
immune function, but Weiner has not yet been able to determine the clinical 
effects. Other researchers are expected to begin similar trials soon. 
</P>
<P>
The results reported in Nature represent a more sophisticated way of achieving 
the same end. Neurologist Arthur A. Vandenbark and his colleagues at the 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland, Ore., synthesized a small 
chemical, called a peptide, that is a key part of the T cells that are involved 
in EAE. 
</P>
<P>
When they vaccinated rats with the peptide, the rats no longer developed EAE 
when they were subsequently injected with ground nerve tissue. This approach is 
preferable to the use of whole cells because it is more widely applicable. In 
treating humans, the patient's own deactivated cells must be used so that the 
injection does not cause an adverse immune reaction. But a peptide would not 
trigger such a reaction, and could be used to treat anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Immunologists Stephen Brostoff and Marc Howell of Immune Response Corp. in San 
Diego said Wednesday they have achieved virtually identical results using a 
slightly different peptide. A report of their findings was presented at a 
recent meeting in England and will appear shortly in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
Brostoff said his company hopes to begin trials in humans "within a year," 
while Vandenbark predicted he would begin trials in "one or two years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease that causes weakness, 
tremors and paralysis in as many as 250,000 Americans. It results when the 
patient's own immune system goes awry, and there is no effective therapy for 
it. Researchers have been attempting to halt its progression by interfering 
with the immune system activity that causes the disease.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
Multiple Sclerosis -- An Oct. 12 article implied that multiple sclerosis 
victims live only 20 to 30 years after diagnosis. While that is sometimes true, 
MS is not considered a lethal disease, according to the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society. Also, while MS typically weakens the neuromuscular system, 
not everyone who contracts the disease develops paralysis.

POLITICS: BALLOT INITIATIVES WILL NOT BE USED TO GET AROUND CAMPAIGN SPENDING 
LAWS, VAN DE KAMP AND WILSON VOW. BUT SUSPICION REFUSES TO DIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two leading candidates for governor are taking the pledge -- the pledge not to 
try to waltz their way around California's new and confusing campaign spending 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
This curious phenomenon arises because of the intertwining of campaigns for 
high office and campaigns for ballot initiatives during this upcoming election 
cycle. Both Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Republican U.S. Sen. 
Pete Wilson have chosen to link their 1990 campaigns for governor with 
grass-roots ballot proposals. Other candidates are contemplating coming forth 
with their own ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law enacted by voters in 1988, candidates for office are under 
strict financial limits. They can receive no more than $1,000 per contributor 
per year, meaning an end to easy financing from fat-cat donors. Candidates are 
instead forced into desperate searches for lots of friends with $1,000 to 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
The fat-cat still has a happy home, however, in supporting ballot initiatives. 
There are no contribution limits for such propositions. And with old-fashioned 
ballot favorites like crime, corruption and the environment leading the agenda 
of proposals, money is bound to flow in large chunks, meaning large advertising 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
So the question is: Does Wilson or Van de Kamp intend to appear in television 
or direct mail advertising paid for by the ballot initiative campaigns, thereby 
supplementing his own limited advertising budget? Or more simply, are ballot 
initiatives really a shortcut around spending limits? 
</P>
<P>
No, both Van de Kamp and Wilson now insist. 
</P>
<P>
The two said they fully intend to pay for their own commercials to link 
themselves in the public eye with their pet proposals -- but only using money 
they have collected under the $1,000 per contribution limit. 
</P>
<P>
And this week, as they have before, they separately pledged not to appear in 
advertisements -- broadcast or printed -- paid for from the treasuries of 
ballot propositions they are pushing. Another major Democratic candidate for 
governor, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, has resisted the 
temptation to work up her own catchy initiative and is not part of the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"Utter nonsense," said Van de Kamp about the continued suspicion that he would 
somehow use the initiatives to finance his own campaign. "I'll be putting much 
more into these campaigns than I'll ever get out of them in terms of television 
broadcasting or the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is a sponsor of three initiatives -- one on legislative ethics, 
another on crime and drugs, and a third on environmental preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilson about his one ballot proposal to speed up criminal trials: "The 
initiative will not pay for any spots in which I appear, not ads in print, 
radio or on television." 
</P>
<P>
This did not end the controversy, however. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson indicated Wednesday that he remains skeptical of Van de Kamp's pledge. 
He cited a letter from a Sacramento law firm to the California Fair Political 
Practices Commission, seeking clarification of the issue. The letter, on behalf 
of an unnamed candidate, asked specifically whether someone seeking office 
could appear in ads for an initiative outside of the spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
"So far there is only one candidate pushing ballot initiatives for the 1990 
campaign," said Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Wilson turned out to be mistaken. The inquiry was not made on behalf 
of Van de Kamp, but for Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is considering whether to 
sponsor a 1990 ballot initiative and wanted clarification of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the commission has declined to make a clear-cut ruling on the issue. It 
rejected the McCarthy letter because of its policy to refuse anonymous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the rules are strict enough. And I don't know what the 
commission can do," said Chairman John Larson. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking for me, and probably all the commissioners, I think there should be 
restrictions on candidates appearing on television (advertisements) in 
connection with ballot propositions. I would hope that we can reach that 
conclusion. That would be the appropriate conclusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes for candidates are easy enough to fathom. Wilson has set a campaign 
budget of about $16 million for his campaign, Van de Kamp $10 million. Most of 
that money will end up in advertising. A few million more in advertising, tied 
to a ballot proposition campaign, could add substantially to a candidate's 
crucial exposure late in a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said the whole issue is overblown because the intention of voters 
is clear. They want candidates limited in receiving contributions. And, he 
said, the precedents of the Fair Political Practices Commission are 
unmistakable: Initiatives will not be allowed to serve as a way around campaign 
finance limits. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson remained unpersuaded. "This is a very serious potential problem. There 
is a very large and unintended loophole," he said.

STATE'S LATINO POPULATION IS UP 2 MILLION, U.S. ESTIMATES 
</P>

California's Latino population, which represents one-third of the Latinos 
nationally, has increased by nearly 2 million since 1980, according to a Census 
Bureau estimate released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the nation's total Latino population has grown by 39% 
since 1980, rising to a record 20.1 million. Latinos now make up 8.2% of the 
U.S. population and have a population growth rate that is five times that of 
non-Latinos, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau spokesman Carmen Denavas said that half of the 6.7 million 
California residents of Latino origin are immigrants. Immigration accounted for 
about 50% of the national increase in the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first estimate of over 20 million," said bureau spokesman Jorge 
Del Pinal. "It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980." 
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report are estimates and include illegal immigrants. There 
are no precise figures for the numbers of illegal immigrants in the state or 
the country, and estimates of the number vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
California retains its rank as the state with by far the largest Latino 
population, followed by Texas, which is home to 21% of the nation's Latinos. 
Next are New York with 10% and Florida with 8%. The report also identified 
Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado as having significant 
Latino populations. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates are not prepared for every state because "Hispanics are not well 
spread out throughout the United States," Del Pinal said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mayor Tom Bradley joined with Latino leaders and 
celebrities to kick off a city campaign designed to encourage Latino youths to 
stand and be counted in the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends, tell your family that Hispanics must be counted to earn 
political power," came a message shouted not from the mouth of a politician, 
but by Latin American rock star Jose Luis Rodriguez, who attended the event at 
Roosevelt High School. 
</P>
<P>
And, based on the high-pitched screams of approval from hundreds of teen-agers, 
the words were well received. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, bolstered with $600,000 in funding, has joined forces 
with a host of community and civic groups to find ways to reach traditionally 
undercounted groups, including Latinos, the homeless and those who live in 
overcrowded apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have targeted high school-age Latino youths because the 
students can pass along census information to their parents and push them to 
fill out forms for the April 1 head count. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, schools in areas with large immigrant populations will 
be sent census lessons for classroom instruction throughout the campaign, which 
lasts until April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The official 1980 count missed as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos, according to 
federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that the largest segment of the Latino population 
is of Mexican descent, about 12.6 million. Residents of Central and South 
American origin total 2.5 million, while those of Puerto Rican descent total 
2.3 million and those of Cuban descent account for 1.1 million. The remainder 
are of Spanish or other Latino origin. 
</P>
<P>
While people of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group in the United 
States, they are not the fastest-growing segment, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimates from 1982 and 1989, the bureau said that the number of 
Central and South Americans had increased by 67%. The "other Hispanic" category 
rose 31%, followed by Mexicans, up 30%, Puerto Ricans, 14%, and Cubans, 12%.

JUDGE TO ALLOW BRAIN TEST TO AID SALCIDO DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sonoma County judge has cleared the way for accused mass murderer Ramon 
Salcido to travel to UC Irvine this month for a state-of-the-art brain scan 
that could aid his defense -- if the university will accept him. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge R. Bryan Jamar on Tuesday denied a motion by Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Peter Bummerts that Salcido not be removed from the Sonoma County jail 
without a special court hearing. Bummerts had warned that flying Salcido to 
Southern California could be a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
However, Salcido's defense attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, said 
Wednesday he believes a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, a brain 
imaging technique that can detect subtle brain malfunctions, could reveal that 
Salcido has suffered organic brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old winery worker could face the death penalty if convicted of 
killing seven people -- two of his three daughters, his wife, mother-in-law, 
two sisters-in-law and his boss -- in an April 14 shooting rampage. The 
killings shocked Sonoma County and prompted a manhunt that ended with Salcido's 
capture in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A finding of brain damage might help persuade a jury that Salcido lacked the 
willfulness and premeditation required for a first-degree murder conviction or 
sway a judge toward leniency if Salcido is convicted, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine Brain Imaging Center, however, has not decided yet whether to 
accept Salcido as a patient, according to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The center's director, Dr. Monte R. Buchsbaum, "indicated he didn't want to use 
this as a fishing expedition to try to find something (abnormal)," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted some definitive data that there is some brain dysfunction, then he 
would go in and explore it further," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum was out of the country and could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he has evidence that Salcido may have suffered brain damage. He 
said the evidence consisted of an electroencephalogram, or EEG, showing some 
disturbance in the right temporal lobe and the fact that Salcido had suffered 
injuries, including electrical shock, as a child. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's PET scanner has already been used by defense attorneys in two other 
trials. In 1985, Buchsbaum performed a PET scan on mass murderer Barry Wayne 
McNamara, who later told psychiatrists that he had been told to kill his family 
by voices on TV. The psychiatrist testified that McNamara's PET scan was 
consistent with other testimony that the defendant was schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bummerts, however, said defense attorneys will have "a long row to 
hoe" in making such claims for Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a statement from him that to me is clear that he knew exactly what he 
was doing, that he had a purpose and that he tried to succeed in accomplishing 
his purpose" by the shootings, Bummerts said. "Proving this claim now that it 
wasn't premeditated is going to be a difficult proposition." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department is preparing to keep Salcido 
under tight wraps if he makes the trip to Irvine. Sgt. Norm Hardin said even 
the date of the PET scan will be kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
Although Salcido has not received death threats, he is being held under maximum 
security and in complete isolation, Hardin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily because of the larger-than-normal amount of notoriety that this 
case has received," he said. "This isn't the normal run-of-the-mill murder. 
</P>
<P>
"We do want to protect Ramon to make sure he has the day in court that the 
Constitution allows him."

REFORMS SEEM TO GIVE FORD CROWING RIGHTS

Former President Gerald R. Ford, once roundly ridiculed for declaring "there is 
no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe," says he is taking particular pleasure 
in liberalization moves there, especially in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother taught me it is wrong to crow," Ford wrote in a column on the op-ed 
page of today's editions of The Washington Post. "But former presidents as well 
as small boys know no greater joy than being able to say: 'I told you so!"' 
</P>
<P>
Ford recalled his statement during a 1976 presidential campaign debate with 
Jimmy Carter, who went on to defeat him, that "there is no Soviet domination of 
Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford Administration." 
</P>
<P>
"I blew it," Ford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Reading the verbatim record with 20/20 hindsight in the light 
of recent developments in Poland and throughout Eastern Europe, I come out 
pretty well as a prophet." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years after he made the statement that angered many Americans of 
Eastern European descent, Ford said countries in the Soviet orbit "are writing 
themselves new constitutions, based on fundamental human rights and freedoms." 
</P>
<P>
The former President noted that "boasting, like lusting, is best limited to 
one's heart." 
</P>
<P>
So, he added, "when my friends say, 'You know, what you said about Poland not 
being dominated by the Soviet Union wasn't so stupid after all,' I give them a 
Sphinx-like smile and accept their (I guess) compliments."

SOVIETS QUIETLY OFFERING DEAL ON DEFENSIVE ARMS;

<P>
DISARMAMENT: IN A NEW BID TO CURB U.S. 'STAR WARS' TESTS, THE KREMLIN SAYS IT'S 
WILLING TO SCRAP THE ANTI-MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM AROUND MOSCOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Moscow, in a new effort to curb the U.S. anti-missile program known as "Star 
Wars," has privately offered to eliminate entirely its own existing 
anti-missile system around Moscow, according to Bush Administration and 
congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union would eliminate the anti-missile weapons it now has deployed 
around its capital if the Administration would commit itself to a narrow 
interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Soviet diplomats have 
suggested. A narrow interpretation of the treaty would act as a brake on some 
facets of the Strategic Defense Initiative or "Star Wars" program. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet arms negotiators also have indicated that the Kremlin is prepared to be 
more flexible on the kinds of experiments with anti-missile components that 
would be permitted in the future -- a key issue for SDI. 
</P>
<P>
The possible concession on Moscow's ABM network, which has been broached twice 
by Soviet diplomats but not yet formally proposed, comes at a time when the 
Administration is already conducting a detailed review of space defense issues, 
particularly the U.S. negotiating position at Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The review probably will lead to changes in the U.S. position that indirectly 
constrain SDI, officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
The new Soviet moves on ABM came in advance of Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's recent "de-linking" of the space defense issue from strategic arms 
talks aimed at cutting offensive weapons by about 50%. But it appears to have 
the same goal as the previous attempt to link SDI and the strategic arms talks: 
restraining the SDI program. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives, such as Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a top Pentagon official in 
the Reagan Administration, fear that the U.S. review of anti-missile defenses 
will be the fig leaf behind which SDI is curtailed or even abandoned by an 
Administration that is far from enthusiastic about the program. 
</P>
<P>
The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972, permits each side to have up to 100 
ground-based rocket interceptors ringing either its capital city (Washington or 
Moscow) or a single offensive missile field. The Soviets initially put 64 
interceptor missiles around Moscow. The United States declared that it would 
not build such a network because it could be easily overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, the Soviets have been replacing their initial system with 
a two-tiered network at a cost measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, 
U.S. officials said. About half of the interceptors are long-range missiles 
that would engage incoming warheads outside the atmosphere. The rest are 
shorter-range, fast-accelerating missiles intended to hit warheads after they 
have re-entered the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The upgraded Soviet system also can be overwhelmed by incoming warheads, 
according to the Pentagon's new "Soviet Military Power" booklet, although the 
Defense Department said that the network does provide some degree of protection 
for "high value" targets in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said privately that more than 20% of all the "high value" targets in 
the Soviet Union, including the leadership shelters and military command 
headquarters, come under Moscow's new anti-missile umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the military value of the Moscow system to the Soviets, eliminating it 
could offer them a significant diplomatic gain. Such a move could rob SDI 
proponents of one of their principal arguments: that the Moscow network could 
become the core of a nationwide anti-missile network if the Soviets suddenly 
chose to break out of the ABM treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Although SDI is not a formal topic of the Administration's review of space 
defense issues, officials concede that decisions made about negotiating stances 
will have an indirect impact on the SDI program. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a senior White House official said that the Administration will 
"not necessarily" continue holding to a key negotiating position of the past -- 
the U.S. refusal to compromise U.S.-Soviet differences on the ABM 
interpretation by agreeing to a list of prohibited and permitted tests that can 
be legally conducted under terms of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"We historically have been opposed" to negotiating such a list, the senior 
official said, "because we don't know right now what we may or may not want to 
do" under the SDI program. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go back now and we'll look over our positions in all these respects," 
he said. "I'm not saying we're willing to drop it. What we have is a new 
condition now that wasn't there before (i.e., "de-linkage"), and we'll go back 
and review all of the positions related to defense in space and see what it is 
that makes sense now in light of this." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Soviet moves, the White House is also under domestic pressures from 
congressional Democrats and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to negotiate a list of 
permitted and prohibited tests. Each has a different reason, however. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wants such a 
list so that Pentagon budget requests are not defeated by liberals who fear 
that the Soviets will abrogate the arms treaties if the United States goes too 
far in SDI testing. 
</P>
<P>
The Joint Chiefs want a list, according to a knowledgeable U.S. official, so 
that the Soviets -- who have their own "Star Wars"-like program going 
unconstrained by Congress -- do not steal a march on the United States with 
some test that will constitute a technological breakthrough.

<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE CLASH IN NAGORNO-KARABAKH REFLECTS GROWING ANIMOSITY BETWEEN 
THE LOCAL POPULATION AND SOLDIERS TRYING TO KEEP THE PEACE.

<P>
Soviet troops opened fire on a crowd of Armenians in the violence-ridden 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, officials said Wednesday. One man was reported 
killed and seven wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The clash, which took place Tuesday night, reflected the growing animosity 
between the local population and troops sent by Moscow in January to patrol the 
area. It brought to 118 the number of people killed in the last 20 months, most 
of them in fighting between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, you are seeing anger between Azerbaijanis and Armenians directed 
instead at Moscow, and the troops are an obvious target for that," said a 
Western diplomat who monitors the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
"For their part, the troops have been increasingly demoralized by their 
inability to stop the bloodshed there. So this kind of violence between the 
people and the soldiers was really inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's clash followed an incident last month in which Azerbaijanis seized 
three Soviet generals and briefly held them hostage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Armenian activists in Stepanakert, the capital of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, have said they have lost confidence in the soldiers sent from 
Moscow and have established vigilante groups to protect themselves against 
possible Azerbaijani attack. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's population of 165,000 are Armenians -- 
most of them Christians -- and many are demanding that the enclave be removed 
from the predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan republic and made a part of Soviet 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted in violence in February, 1988, and dozens of people were 
killed in waves of ethnic rioting in the two republics. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday night's clash, according to Yuri M. Arshenevsky, a spokesman for the 
Interior Ministry, six soldiers were injured when soldiers crossing a bridge 
into Stepanakert were confronted by an enraged mob. 
</P>
<P>
Arshenevsky said the crowd of Armenians began throwing rocks and then firing on 
the troops with hunting rifles, forcing the troops to return their fire in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
But this version was disputed by an Armenian legislator, Ashot Manucharyan, who 
said in a telephone interview that most of the crowd converged at the bridge 
only after the troops fired warning shots and a signal flare into the sky. He 
said none of the civilians had fired. 
</P>
<P>
Arshenevsky said eight civilians were wounded in the confrontation, and 
Manucharyan said that one of them died later in a hospital.

made up largely of Armenian intellectuals demanding independence for the 
enclave, also said that one of the eight wounded had died. Galstyan charged 
that the Soviet troops had fired on a peaceful crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's efforts to bring calm to Nagorno-Karabakh through the presence of 
troops and a special commission to run the region has not worked, Western 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians and Azerbaijanis living in the region have continued to fight each 
other with homemade weapons and guns obtained illicitly. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television reported earlier this week that a large cache of weapons and 
ammunition had been found on board a helicopter chartered by Armenians to fly 
supplies into Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
Food and fuel supplies have diminished steadily, and a diplomatic source said 
Wednesday that the region is beset by a hepatitis epidemic that has spread 
because of the lack of medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures kept by independent Western analysts, 118 people have been 
killed in the 20 months since trouble flared in Nagorno-Karabakh, 1,000 people 
have been injured and more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a rail blockade of Armenia that Azerbaijani activists had promised 
to end appeared to be continuing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Local Azerbaijani officials and the Azerbaijani Popular Front had signed a 
pledge to stop preventing trains from reaching Armenia. But Armenian officials 
said cars loaded with fuel and food were being derailed before they reached 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said that fuel tankers were arriving filled with water. They 
said that Azerbaijanis, including women and children, were lying across 
railroad tracks to prevent cars loaded with goods from reaching Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani activists say the blockade started Sept. 4, but Armenian officials 
say goods virtually stopped arriving by rail nearly three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background 
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh has a predominantly Christian Armenian population but was 
administered by mostly Muslim Azerbaijan until February, when growing tensions 
prompted Moscow to impose direct rule. The ethnic Armenians, claiming to be the 
victims of discrimination, demanded that the region be declared part of Soviet 
Armenia. The Kremlin fears that the 20-month-old feud over control of the 
enclave appears to be edging closer to civil war.

FEDERAL PANEL URGES STEPS TO HALT FLIGHT OF DOCTORS FROM OBSTETRICS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: SHIELDING PHYSICIANS FROM MALPRACTICE COSTS AND OFFERING INCENTIVES 
TO PRACTICE IN UNDER-SERVED AREAS ARE PROPOSED.

<P>
Federal and state governments must take "immediate steps" to curb the flight of 
physicians and other health professionals from the practice of obstetrics and 
to ensure access to care for all women who need it, especially the poor, an 
Institute of Medicine panel recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of malpractice litigation represents "a serious threat to the 
delivery of obstetrical care in this nation," according to the committee, which 
conducted a two-year study for the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing liability costs and the fear of being sued have affected the 
availability of care, especially in rural areas, and many health care 
professionals have limited their practices, particularly for women with 
high-risk pregnancies, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member committee comprised individuals with expertise in medicine, law, 
ethics, insurance, economics and public policy. The Institute of Medicine is an 
affiliate of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, a congressionally 
chartered private organization that advises the federal government on matters 
of science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"While liability issues have been a growing concern for all medical 
specialties, the issue is particularly acute in obstetrics," said Roger J. 
Bulger, president of the Assn. of Academic Health Centers, who headed the 
committee. "The result is a serious shortage of obstetrical care in many rural 
and inner-city areas." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Bulger said at a press conference, the committee determined that "all 
too often, the trust relationship that used to be typical of a provider-patient 
contract has become adversarial in nature." 
</P>
<P>
The committee found that the number of obstetrics providers in rural areas has 
fallen by 20% during the last five years. Bulger said that the decline "has 
left sizable rural areas, such as entire counties, without obstetrical care." 
</P>
<P>
Rural areas have been disproportionately affected, he said, because the family 
physicians and nurse-midwives who deliver more than two-thirds of babies born 
there have relatively low incomes and are harder hit by rising malpractice 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
For the short term, the panel suggested new measures to improve the access of 
poor women to obstetrical care. 
</P>
<P>
It recommended that the federal government put providers of maternity care in 
government-financed community and migrant health centers under the Federal 
Torts Claims Act, which permits an injured party to sue the government under 
certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"This would relieve practitioners of steep malpractice insurance and of 
personal liability, while providing plaintiffs a legal remedy," Bulger said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended also that states establish programs that either indemnify 
or subsidize the medical liability premiums of obstetrical providers who 
participate in Medicaid or who otherwise provide care to low-income women. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the panel proposed that the National Health Service Corps, a federal 
program, "be revived and expanded" through improved scholarships and loan 
options to help increase the number of physicians in under-served areas. 
</P>
<P>
For the long term, the panel suggested alternatives to the current legal 
system, including no-fault compensation for certain injuries, such as 
neurological impairment of a newborn, and privately negotiated contracts 
between patients and providers that would establish in advance that binding 
arbitration or some other mechanism would be used to settle disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the panel said that it supported a proposal already made by the American 
Medical Assn. to set up a fault-based administrative process in which state 
agencies would review claims, determine fault, fix awards and discipline 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government should encourage these changes by funding pilot projects 
in various states, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of which alternatives work best for individual states, one course 
we should not take is inaction," Bulger said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chairman of a House panel that is scheduled to conduct 
hearings today on the impact of malpractice on obstetrics, said the new report 
"shows that, without dramatic immediate action, we will see the plight of 
low-income pregnant women worsening alarmingly." 
</P>
<P>
Wyden, who heads the subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and 
energy of the House Small Business Committee, said that "the government and the 
medical community must do more to protect patients and we must realistically 
assess the causes of the problem in order to formulate long-term workable 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Before reaching its conclusions, the panel commissioned more than 20 papers by 
experts in various fields, initiated three surveys to collect new data and 
studied more than 50 previously conducted surveys, Bulger said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, obstetrician-gynecologists are "more than twice as likely" as other 
physicians to be sued, and claims against them generally run "two to three 
times higher" than for other medical specialties, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when a case comes to trial, the jury finds for the plaintiff "twice 
as often" as is the case for other specialties, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to understand this situation, since most cases involve 
brain-damaged infants whose parents generally are without resources to provide 
for a lifetime of complex care," Bulger said. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members said they found that the day-to-day practice of obstetrics has 
been affected by liability issues. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these changes have been beneficial, Bulger said, such as improved 
patient record-keeping and "better discussion with patients about health risks 
and options in obstetrical care." 
</P>
<P>
But he called other changes "questionable," such as the routine use of 
electronic fetal monitoring, which he said increases the likelihood of 
unnecessary Cesarean deliveries.

KEY PIECE OF DOOMED DC-10 FOUND IN FIELD

The discovery of a key engine part from a jumbo jet that crashed in July has 
intensified the search of Iowa cornfields for other pieces to the puzzle of 
what caused the DC-10's rear engine to fly apart, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet whether this is the golden nugget we're looking for," said 
Jim Burnett, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, of the 
discovery of the engine's fan disk. "But we're glad we found it." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for General Electric Co., which made the engine, said that the fan 
disk of the crippled DC-10 that crashed on July 19 when trying to land at the 
Sioux City airport is vital to the investigation into what happened to United 
Flight 232. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the key to the whole search," said Jerry Clark, a flight safety 
investigator for GE. 
</P>
<P>
Clark spoke at the Storm Lake airport before the fan disk was flown to GE's 
Evandale jet engine plant in suburban Cincinnati, where it arrived later in the 
day. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said that federal inspectors would oversee 
analysis of the part. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred searchers hired by GE will walk newly harvested fields in northwest 
Iowa this weekend looking for additional parts. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 232 crashed at the Sioux Gateway Airport after its aft engine 
disintegrated in flight, throwing off parts that severed the plane's hydraulic 
lines. The jet cartwheeled across the runway in a fiery crash that killed 112 
people; 184 survived. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been recovering small pieces of the No. 2 engine for several 
weeks, but investigators said that the key to what happened is apparently the 
290-pound titanium disk that holds fan blades. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, about two-thirds of the disc assembly was found by Janice Sorenson, 
who was running a combine through corn a half mile from her house on her farm 
about 10 miles north of Alta. Alta is about 80 miles northwest of Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a resistance against the combine, so I backed up, and I looked and I 
could see the fan blades protruding from the ground," Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the disk "was buried between 6 and 8 inches. It was all in one piece 
but there were pieces of fan blades that had been broken off." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett said it is too early to assume that a flaw in the disk caused the 
crash. "The metallurgical examination of the disk itself, if in fact the 
problem originated there, should . . . reveal the cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely, he said, that the NTSB will disclose results of tests before a 
hearing that begins Oct. 30 in Sioux City. 
</P>
<P>
In Evandale, GE plant spokesman David Lane would not theorize about what might 
have gone wrong with the disk, which probably was made in the early 1970s, but 
he said that GE was eager to see the part. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant find, in our eyes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
GE lawyer Stephen Gadd said Sorenson will receive a part of the $50,000 reward 
it offered for the disk equal to the percentage of the disk she recovered, plus 
separate rewards for each fan blade. The company is paying up to $1,000 each 
for recovered blades.

TOWN DELIVERS HEALTH KICK TO CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINES

Cigarette vending machines will be snuffed out in this St. Paul suburb in 90 
days by an ordinance passed by the City Council, a move that one health expert 
calls the first of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, passed 4 to 1 Tuesday, calls for the removal of the 19 cigarette 
vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience stores and apartment and 
office buildings in this town of 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
The law was backed by the city Fire Department, several University of Minnesota 
researchers, the White Bear Lake School Board and a coalition of business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe White Bear Lake is the first city in the country to ban cigarette 
vending machines," Jean Forster, assistant professor of public health at the 
University of Minnesota, said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Bill Bennis, in casting his dissent, said: "Machines are not 
attacking the real problem. If merchants are sincere about this, they'd take 
cigarettes out of their place of business." 
</P>
<P>
A local group called the Tobacco Free Youth Project, whose members have 
interviewed juvenile smokers, maintains that 93% get their cigarettes from 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months ago, White Bear Lake police started arresting juveniles caught 
smoking in public. So far, 155 teen-agers have been arrested and ordered to 
attend a two-night lecture and discussion session at the White Bear Lake 
Community Counseling Center.

2 CAMPS TRY TO SORT OUT PANAMA EVENTS

Refugees from the unsuccessful coup in Panama remained in seclusion in Miami 
Wednesday as the Bush Administration and Panamanian exiles each tried to put 
together a coherent account of last week's debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, seeking to deflect charges that they helped cause the 
failure by not providing adequate support for the coup, have been working to 
portray the coup leaders as disorganized bunglers. The exiles, meanwhile, are 
"attempting to get themselves together" and "work things out internally before 
they present their case to the public," said a congressional source who has 
been in contact with the Panamanians. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Panamanians appear to be divided about how much they should blame 
the failure of their coup on the Administration, which has disappointed them in 
the past but which remains their chief hope for ever returning home. 
</P>
<P>
Several exile sources have quoted coup survivors as saying that the U.S. 
government did not provide promised aid for their effort. But another 
Panamanian source, who has been in close contact with the exiles, insisted that 
"they don't blame the United States." The downfall of the coup was confusion 
and a "lack of coordination" with U.S. forces, this source said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush met Wednesday morning with two senior members of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee to smooth relations after his national security 
adviser and defense secretary complained about congressional "micromanagement" 
of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The micromanagement charges surfaced Sunday during a television appearance by 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
repeated the charge Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press, 
complaining that congressional interference during the coup last week created 
"all kinds of problems" for the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is the commander in chief. He's the one who has to manage a 
crisis. You cannot have every member of Congress involved," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The comments set off a minor storm in Congress, which Bush sought to quiet by 
meeting Wednesday with Sens. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and William S. Cohen 
(R-Me.), the chairman and senior GOP member of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The senators emerged placated. "The meeting had a very good spirit," Boren said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to analyze the failure of the coup continue to be hindered by the 
welter of conflicting stories about practically every key moment in the drama. 
</P>
<P>
Several sources, for example, have said that after the rebels seized Noriega's 
compound, Noriega's subordinates summoned help while the general remained under 
detention in his office. But an American military officer with long experience 
in Panama said that two Panamanians who participated in the coup told him that 
the rebels actually let Noriega leave after deciding not to turn him over to 
American officials. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels sent the general home from Panama Defense Forces headquarters with 
an aide-de-camp and a chauffeur behind the wheel of his blue Mercedes, this 
source said. Once clear of the compound, Noriega apparently picked up his car 
phone and ordered his protege, Maj. Fiqui Olechaea , commander of Battalion 
2000, the largest combat unit of the Defense Forces, to attack the compound. 
</P>
<P>
The attack led to the death of the coup's leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega. One 
source said that Noriega shot Giroldi three times in the chest after the major 
was beaten by other Panamanian officers, and shot the other coup leader in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
The various stories about the coup seem to agree on one key point -- that the 
insurrection was doomed when Battalion 2000 threw in its lot with Noriega 
rather than the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian exile leader said he was told by Capt. Javier Licona, the most 
senior officer to survive the coup, that the rebels had been counting on the 
support of the elite battalion when they seized Noriega's headquarters in 
Panama City the morning of Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The exile source offered no explanation of why the battalion, whose 
participation was apparently central to the rebels' plans, did not join them. 
He said that Giroldi "kept his planning close to his chest." He added that when 
Giroldi died, "a lot of explanations died with him."

The widow of the Panamanian major who led an unsuccessful coup against Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega says it failed because her husband was betrayed by another 
major who switched sides at the last minute, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
Adela Bonilla de Giroldi said in a New York Times interview that her husband, 
Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had worked with Maj. Fiqui Olechaea, commander of the 
elite Battalion 2000, in planning the coup. But instead of helping oust 
Noriega, Olechaea used his battalion to crush the coup.

<P>
Colombian police announced Wednesday that they have arrested the fourth-ranking 
trafficker in the Medellin cocaine cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Rafael Abello, who was seized Tuesday night as he dined in a Bogota 
restaurant, will be extradited to the United States to answer cocaine charges 
in a federal court in Oklahoma, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest was regarded by Colombian authorities as a milestone in their drive 
against traffickers who use Colombia as the hub for world cocaine distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers said that Abello, 34, nicknamed "the Monkey," was No. 4 in the 
Medellin cartel and one of three important cartel figures now in Colombian 
custody. The others are Evaristo Porras, who was captured in Ecuador and 
extradited to Colombia on Oct. 2, and Bernardo Pelaez, arrested in Colombia in 
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
The three are the highest-level traffickers caught since President Virgilio 
Barco Vargas began a blitz against the Medellin cartel on Aug. 18, a police 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who for security reasons asked not to be identified, said agents 
of Colombia's Administrative Department of Security arrested Abello at dinner. 
Although Abello was accompanied by bodyguards, he did not resist arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Abello, based in the port city of Santa Marta, was the Medellin cartel's chief 
of transportation on the northern coast, where most Colombian cocaine leaves by 
private plane or ship en route to the United States, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Abello was outranked in the cartel only by fugitive kingpins Pablo 
Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and Jorge Luis Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an intimate friend of Pablo Escobar," the official said. "He had a 
monopoly on transportation from the coast." 
</P>
<P>
He said Abello had fled Santa Marta after President Barco's crackdown began, 
and that intelligence information helped agents track him in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
He said no charges have been filed against Abello in Colombia but that the 
United States had requested his arrest for extradition several weeks ago, based 
on federal charges in Oklahoma of "conspiracy and distribution of cocaine." The 
U.S. Embassy in Bogota refuses to comment on extradition cases. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Justice Department officials said that Abello, born in 1954, was 
indicted in October, 1987, in the northern district of Oklahoma on charges of 
conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to distribute it. He allegedly was 
part of a group trying to ship 500 kilos of cocaine from Colombia to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said Colombia had arrested Abello on its own authority but 
that the Justice Department had asked the State Department to present papers to 
Colombia for his provisional arrest, the next step in the extradition process. 
</P>
<P>
Abello was roughly equal in cartel rank to Porras, the Colombian police 
official said. Porras, 41, was hiding under a false identity in Ecuador when 
police there arrested him last month. He is wanted in Colombia to serve out a 
two-year sentence for illegal possession of arms. The 1986 sentence was upheld 
by the Colombian Supreme Court this week. Porras is also wanted in Peru, where 
he was arrested in 1978 on cocaine trafficking charges. Peru has requested his 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
The police said Porras was once in charge of shipping cocaine paste from Peru 
for refining by the Medellin cartel. He was based in Leticia, a town in the 
Amazon lowlands near the Brazil border. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian newspaper El Tiempo has called Porras "one of the heads of 
narcotics traffic in Colombia." He is not wanted in the United States, a U.S. 
Embassy spokesman said. The Colombian police official said agents of the U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration suspect Porras of being involved in major 
American cocaine deals, but "there is no proof." 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Pelaez was announced Sept. 14 by the Administrative Department of 
Security, which said he would be extradited to the United States for trial in 
Detroit on charges of "conspiracy and distribution of cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, head of the department, said then that Pelaez was 
"much bigger" in the cartel than Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was extradited to 
the United States on Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, charged in Atlanta with laundering money for the Medellin cartel, was 
the first major cartel suspect to be caught in the current Colombian crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha have eluded police despite a $250,000 reward 
offered by Colombian authorities.

COUNTY GEARS FOR WALKOUT BY 5,126 NURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a strike by 5,126 nurses looming for today, Los Angeles County-run clinics 
and hospitals prepared Wednesday to drastically scale back their operations -- 
including diverting ambulances to private hospitals, discharging or 
transferring patients and postponing non-emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A walkout, set to begin at 12:01 a.m., appeared imminent -- unless a last-ditch 
effort by Board of Supervisors Chairman Ed Edelman to settle the dispute 
between the county and the nurses over pay and working conditions produced an 
end to the stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, a former federal mediator, summoned both parties to his Hall of 
Administration office Wednesday afternoon. Both sides met for several hours 
with Edelman, but had reached no accord by late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
About 5:20 p.m., Edelman emerged and told reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful that before the evening is out we will reach some kind of 
settlement. We may be getting close." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials predicted that even a short strike could overwhelm the 
county's sprawling public health care system and would severly impact private 
facilities, where most of the patients would be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
When the nurses struck for three days in January, 1988, the county's emergency 
and trauma services were severly curtailed, filling emergency rooms at private 
hospitals in cities throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
In that dispute a Superior Court judge ordered the nurses back to work. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, county health officials scrambled to draw up contingency plans to 
handle a nursing shortage, including training doctors and mapping out transfer 
plans for hundreds of non-critical patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Our health care system is so depleted and so fragile that every element has to 
be functioning, or all the elements are strained," said David Langness, a 
spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California. "If you lose one 
element, then the entire system begins to back up so any contigency plan will 
only work well for a short amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
County officials have said they will seek a court order, as they did in 1988, 
directing the nurses to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
Union negotiators said they did not yet know what they would do if ordered back 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses, represented by Local 660 of the Service Employees International 
Union, AFL-CIO, want a 22% pay raise over the two year life of the contract, 
plus increased security, such as security guards to escort nurses to their cars 
at night. 
</P>
<P>
The county Tuesday night made a "last, best and final offer" of a 17.25% 
increase over two years. 
</P>
<P>
The full impact of a strike at six county hospitals and 47 clinics, should it 
occur, was not expected to be felt until 7 a.m., when the morning shift begins, 
said Deborah Williams, an emergency room nurse at County-USC Medical Center and 
a member of the union negotiating team. Nurses who began work at 11 p.m. 
Wednesday were expected to finish their shifts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of anger out there," said union spokesman Steve Weingarten. "The 
nurses are mad at the wages that they're getting. They're mad that the county 
just stood up and walked out" of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
County nurses -- who currently earn between $2,600 and $3,000 a month -- claim 
they make less money than nurses working at private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"We want something that is going to rebuild the health care network, not to 
mention take care of the stress of the nurses," Weingarten said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential effects of the strike already were felt at several county 
facilities Wednesday, when the majority of the county's 64 nurse anesthetists 
staged what a union official called a wildcat sick-out, forcing postponent of 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Foley, administrator at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, said the sickout 
forced the closure of three operating rooms at the 553-bed facility in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the emergency rooms at Harbor and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center already were filled to capacity and would only accept critical 
care patients. County officials said the number of patient transfers would 
depend on the number of nurses who stay off the job. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cordova, administrator of General Hospital, part of the 1,450-bed 
County-USC Medical Center complex, said he expects the hospital to begin 
discharging patients early and diverting ambulances to other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
County hospital administrators said they would also postpone scheduled 
surgeries for non-critical patients, including heart bypass and abdominal 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room remains open, but we will ask paramedics to take patients 
to private hospitals," Cordova said. "We will probably look at closing down the 
outpatient services," where patients walk in for non-emergency care, such as 
immunizations or routine medical appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"We could take some cases, but there is no way we would be able to take the 
current workload," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The giant hospital treats 500 patients in its emergency room each day. 
</P>
<P>
Cordova said he expects some nurses to report to work, supplementing non-union 
nursing supervisors. He said that when the nurses struck for three days in 
1988, the hospital cut in half its number of patients, from 900 to 450. 
</P>
<P>
A recorded telephone message at union headquarters advised nurses: 
</P>
<P>
"After several days of continuous negotiations, county management declared 
impasse and refused to continue negotiations. Efforts are being made to get the 
county back to the bargining table." 
</P>
<P>
Nurses are planning to set up picket lines outside of hospitals today. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Moreland, a recovery room nurse at Martin Luther King hospital in 
Watts, said the effects of the potential walkout could already be seen at the 
facility Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The recovery room is packed with patients, because they are trying to get all 
of the patients out of the way before (today)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said that several nursing supervisors skipped work Wednesday, 
because they knew that they "would have to pull long hours tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
County health officials said management employees, including non-union nurses, 
were prepared to work 16-hour shifts today should there be a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators met all day and into the night Tuesday in their 20th bargaining 
session, attended by about 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials claimed the county broke off talks without giving the union 
time to "sleep on" the county's final offer. 
</P>
<P>
But county negotiator Jim Ellman said the union refused to meet any further. He 
said he has asked the county Employee Relations Commission to appoint a 
mediator, but, "My impression is that the union is not interested in 
mediation." 
</P>
<P>
The parties can either voluntarily agree to a mediator, or the employee 
relations commission can order one. The commission is not scheduled to meet 
until Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to go to court if we need to," Ellman said, but he declined to 
say when the county would file a suit similar to the one that resulted in the 
1988 court order against striking nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Andrea Ford, Edward J. Boyer and Hector Tobar contributed 
to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 5,000 Los Angeles County nurses struck for three days before a judge 
ordered them back to work. They set a deadline of 12:01 a.m. this morning to 
again walk off the job in a salary dispute with the county, threatening to 
cause havoc to the county's vast hospital and neighborhood clinic system that 
primarily serves low-income patients. The nurses, who have demanded a 22% pay 
raise over two years, say they are paid far less than those who work in private 
hospitals. The county has offered a 17.25% raise over two years.

Opposition members of Parliament disrupted upper house proceedings and heckled 
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi with cries of "Thief!" and "Resign!" amid continued 
allegations over the scandal-tainted purchase of Swedish-made artillery. As the 
first day of a four-day session of the 242-seat House of Elders opened, 
opposition leaders demanded that Gandhi respond to a Hindu newspaper report 
raising questions of wrongdoing in the 1986 artillery deal with A.B. Bofors, 
the Swedish arms giant. But the catcalls began as Gandhi rose to respond to the 
accusations.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAS PIPELINE BREAK PROMPTS EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction workers ruptured a natural gas pipeline in the 7500 block of Santa 
Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood Tuesday, forcing officials to shut down the 
busy street and briefly evacuate several buildings as a precaution. There was 
no explosion and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, buried five feet underground, was ruptured about 11:15 a.m. by a 
private construction crew that was converting overhead power lines to 
underground, said Helen Goss, a city public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 workers from four buildings near the leak were evacuated and 
pedestrians were kept out of the area, Goss said. The leak was sealed about 
noon.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TRASHING SPIRIT OF MEETING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State law requires public boards and agencies to conduct the public's business 
in public. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Unified School District board members may not have violated the letter 
of that open-meeting law. But they surely trashed its spirit when they met in 
Palm Springs in August and voted, 4 to 3, to change school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees have come under fire from a group of parents who believe that the 
vote created racially segregated schools. The change allows a group of 
predominantly white parents to send their children to an elementary school that 
has a 90% white enrollment, instead of another school that is 49% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice President Ruth Evans said the board "did not break the law," 
ostensibly because the meeting was open to anyone who cared to make the long 
journey. But obviously, no parents thought the long trip was necessary, with an 
agenda that described the board's Palm Springs "retreat" as a study session. 
</P>
<P>
The board is legally bound to do the public's business in public. It should 
also do it in the district, not 100 miles away.

THERE'S NO HOKEYPOKEY IN THIS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: PORTLAND STATE PHENOMENON IS PART SHOW-BIZ, PART STRATEGY; BUT MORE 
THAN ANYTHING, IT'S POPULAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's as if Pokey and Dream have this slogan, "Watch What We'll Do Next" for 
Portland State football games. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, they're putting together Mascot Day. Michelin Man, Smokey the Bear, 
McGruff the Crime Dog and dozens of other characters of varying degrees of fame 
will parade around at halftime, just for the heck of it. 
</P>
<P>
With Pokey and Steve (Dream) Weaver around, Portland State does lots of kooky 
stunts and draws publicity around the nation. The crowds love it all, and 
sometimes even get to call some of the plays. Of course, the Vikings also have 
reached the Division II national championship game the last two years, so the 
crowds have grown and grown. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Weaver, the director of marketing and promotions at Portland State, may 
even be thinking about "Monday Night Football." He has already tapped into 
everything from the school paper -- he took $300 from a student in one of the 
more memorable attention-getters -- to "The Today Show." 
</P>
<P>
And Pokey Allen, the coach, takes care of the rest. He goes along with Weaver's 
stunts and wins the games. 
</P>
<P>
He also is given to sleepwalking and once, while somnambulating, stepped off 
his houseboat on the Columbia River and into the drink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pokey's Fun Football 
</P>
<P>
His real name is Ernest Duncan Allen Jr., but he was Pokey before he even knew 
it. His father's nickname was Pokey, too, so little Ernest inherited that 
moniker right along with the given name. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of people out there named Pokey," Ernest Jr. said. "Probably 
a few dogs and a couple horses." 
</P>
<P>
He attended high school in Missoula, Mont., then went to the University of 
Utah, where he was captain of the 1964 team that went 9-2 and won the Liberty 
Bowl game. His playing career ended after three years as starting cornerback 
and backup quarterback to Joe Kapp for the British Columbia Lions in the 
Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a coach since 1967, everything from an assistant in Canada to 
defensive coordinator with the L.A. Express and Portland Breakers of the United 
States Football League. But nothing ever like this. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it's the first time Allen has been the head coach, not counting 
the four years spent as co-coach at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
For another, the folks at Portland State are a little, well, far out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think his (real) personality is a match to the crazy-living 
personality he has (developed)," said Dick Coury, Allen's boss with the 
Breakers and now the Rams' quarterback coach. "He was involved with some of the 
things they'd done with the press and the fans and he likes what it does for 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
So when Pokey comes on TV to push attendance by warning, "If you don't get your 
tickets now, a big meteor is going to land in your back yard," understand that 
it's the script. But realize at the same time that it works. The average 
attendance last season was 11,594, up from 4,071 in 1985, the year before Allen 
arrived. That's a 285% jump. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've gotten across to the people of Portland that Portland State is a 
place to go to watch fun football," said Pokey, whose team plays host to Cal 
State Northridge Saturday. "The coaches are the ones who started the tailgate 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
At Portland State, a commuter school with an enrollment of about 16,000, half 
of whom are part-time or night students, the popular pregame parking-lot 
parties didn't go over big at first. In fact, they were mostly coaches-only 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some transients stopped by to grab some lunch meats," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
That was back when they played "The Hokeypokey" song after every Viking 
touchdown. That gimmick has disappeared, though, and so have the winos. Fans 
have taken their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pokey and His Paycheck 
</P>
<P>
Pokey made a bold prediction while speaking to the State Board of Higher 
Education in December, 1987, during a presentation intended to show that the 
program had enough support to consider moving up to Division I-AA. He said that 
the Vikings would average 10,000 fans for home games the next season, including 
playoffs. He felt so confident, the coach said, that he would bet his paycheck 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
The next fall, Bill Clunie remembered and decided to hold him to it. A 
columnist at the Vanguard, the student newspaper, Clunie offered to donate one 
of his monthly paychecks, worth about $300, to the athletic department 
scholarship fund of Allen's choice if the Vikings broke the 10,000 mark. If 
they didn't, Allen would forfeit one of his checks, about $2,100 after taxes 
and IRA payments, to the English department scholarship of Clunie's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the athletic department were infuriated with Clunie, accusing him of 
trying to show up the coach. But Weaver, who never met a promotion he didn't 
like, and Allen, thought it was a great gimmick. They held a press conference 
on the 50-yard line of Civic Stadium one day to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Portland State had a 4-2-1 record, was averaging 8,017 for its 
home games and had only two left on the schedule, although the Vikings were 
strongly hoping to be back in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But the gimmick took off. More than once, Pokey would be walking along when 
somebody would roll down the car window and shout: "I'm coming. I'm going to 
save your paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
And save it the fans did. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings got 14,163 in a victory over Southern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after two road games, including a 49-0 thrashing of Cal Lutheran before 
1,733, they returned to 13,934 at Civic Stadium and beat Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Next came victories in the Division II playoffs: Bowie State before 9,773; 
Jacksonville State in front of 13,210; and, finally, with 21,079 looking on, 
Texas A&amp;I for a second consecutive trip to the title game in Florence, Ala. 
Portland State, which in 1987 lost the championship game to Troy State of 
Alabama, 31-17, was beaten in Florence by North Dakota State, 35-21. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time to collect on the attendance bet, the football coaches 
went soft. They didn't want to take Clunie's money. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about holding a postseason tailgate party, making a cake to look 
like a check and having Clunie eat that. 
</P>
<P>
But no. Clunie paid up. 
</P>
<P>
And Pokey and Dream said they took the money. 
</P>
<P>
Others aren't so sure they didn't slip most of it back to him. 
</P>
<P>
Pokey just thinks about the attention it all got and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like any promotion," he said. "People like to laugh and be cute, but 
you're not sure it's going to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Like when I bet the paycheck. It was just a fluke that the school paper 
reporter remembered what I said at a school board meeting. But that was maybe 
the most fun we ever had. That may have been the first time we really brought 
the school together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dream Homecoming 
</P>
<P>
Mark it on your calendars: Coming Nov. 4, it's, Geez, I Can't Get to My 
Homecoming Homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
Take in the 7 p.m. game against Western Illinois at Civic Stadium and pretend 
it's the homecoming you couldn't get to. Forget that work commitments won't 
allow you to get home for the real thing. Pay a to-be-determined fee -- this is 
a fund-raiser for the athletic department, after all -- and it'll be the 
next-best thing to being there. 
</P>
<P>
Portland State will take care of the rest. You'll even get a name change to 
celebrate with. 
</P>
<P>
Can't get to Chapel Hill? Welcome alumni from the North Carolina Tar Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Trip to South Bend too expensive? Hello representatives of the Notre Dame 
Fighting Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
But, wait. There's more. A, Geez, I Can't Get to My Homecoming king and queen 
will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
Dress accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Dream Weaver 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the demented promoter behind all this," Dream says. 
</P>
<P>
No one disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
He was simply Steve Weaver until 1976, when Gary Wright had a pop smash on the 
charts in "Dream Weaver." The nickname stuck to Steve, who, unlike Ernest, 
didn't mind the tag much. It fit nicely. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he was director of public relations for the St. Louis Stars of the 
North American Soccer League. He read the autobiography of Bill Veeck, perhaps 
sports' greatest nonconformist-promoter and wrote to the Chicago White Sox 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
Veeck responded, wished Weaver luck and told him to stop by if he ever was in 
Chicago. Dream did. He stuck around for six days, learning about promotions. 
</P>
<P>
Allen called last September, saying he could use some help pumping a Division 
II college. Dream, who was promoting air shows at the time, came, planning to 
stay 10 weeks. He has never left. 
</P>
<P>
Of his relationship with Pokey, Weaver says: "Somebody once told us, 'You two 
are cut from the same cloth. And it's out of style.' " 
</P>
<P>
Except that Viking football has become very trendy. It's just that no one could 
have Dreamed it would be this popular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Great Bag-Off 
</P>
<P>
When it was time for the Bag-Off, everything was in place. The judges certified 
that all the groceries on the table in front of Pokey and Dream would fit into 
three bags. Mark Goodman, host of Allen's weekly radio show -- not a bad 
platform for a Division II coach -- readied to call the play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
The object, beyond bagging the goods, was -- what else? -- raising money. The 
Bag-Off promoted Football Fever, itself a fund-raiser by food manufacturers, 
distributors and grocery stores around Oregon that, contrary to the name, got 
money for non-revenue sports. After eight years with just Oregon and Oregon 
State participating, Portland State was allowed in for the first time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Dream declared the contest to be held under the rules of Australian Rules 
Bagging, and they were off. Weaver was the first to fill. Allen didn't go 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"I bagged hurt," Pokey announced on his show the next week. "But I tried not to 
let it hurt my performance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bleacher Quarterbacks 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in the second series of the second half during the season opener 
against Cameron University of Lawton, Okla., the Vikings took over on the 
Cameron 26-yard line after recovering a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd went wild. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard went wild, too, urging fans to "Help Pokey Call The Play" and 
flashing "Run" or "Pass" underneath. 
</P>
<P>
The cheerleaders went wild, encouraging the fans to hold up their signs. 
</P>
<P>
The public-address announcer went semi-wild, telling the fans to help Pokey 
call the play. 
</P>
<P>
This was perhaps the pinnacle of Portland State promotions, even though it 
wasn't a Dream original. The 1,500 fans in two sections just behind the Viking 
bench were asked, ta-da, to call the series. 
</P>
<P>
"The place went absolutely nuts," Weaver said. "Pokey had a big grin on his 
face when he saw all the cards go up. It was a pretty amazing sight." 
</P>
<P>
Just before halftime, eight kids had gone into the stands, handing out white 18 
x 24-inch cards. One side said RUN in eight-inch red letters, the other said 
PASS, in green. The crowd would actually determine how Portland State would go. 
</P>
<P>
Without much time to get a quick reading and then send in the play, Pokey 
turned to his new offensive coordinators. Suddenly, this didn't seem like such 
a great promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded a lot better in June than it did on that day in September," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pokey stayed with it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
PASS, the crowd decreed. 
</P>
<P>
The play was good for 14 yards, and a roughing-the-passer penalty moved the 
ball to the six. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only 14-7 and we were struggling," Allen recalled. "I said to myself, 
'If we screw this up, we'll be laughingstocks.' 
</P>
<P>
"There was more than some stress involved. You're on the field with 15,000 
people yelling and you have to turn around and see the signs and who's yelling 
pass and who's yelling run? It's hard to tell. There were so many signs in the 
two sections and you have only about 10 seconds to make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Pokey turned again for the next play. 
</P>
<P>
RUN, the crowd said. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing, too. If the fans had called for a pass, he might have run anyway 
and claimed he had miscounted in the pressure of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
When running back Curtis Delgardo, the 1988 Western Football Conference player 
of the year, scored on the next play, the crowd was off the hook. So was Pokey. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to get a reading of how popular the stunt was on the first try, Weaver 
went into the stands the next day, figuring anyone who had had a good time 
would have kept his card. He found only 15 of the 1,500 that had been handed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
He and Dream will probably try it again next season, but not before. Pokey said 
he couldn't stand the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Dream, however, thrives on pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year," he said, "we may do the house." 
</P>
<P>
The every-week fan-involvement gimmick here is Call a Play. Pokey resorts to it 
once a game at home games. The mailed entries are coming in at a rate of about 
120 a week now, and Allen and the staff sort through them, picking the best 
one. Something catchy and tricky but not too ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes time to put the chosen play into action, Pokey, still facing the 
field, waves a white towel over his head. That's the sign to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Some suggestions that don't figure to fly: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The receiver should run out of bounds and then back into play. "If you 
don't get caught, this could work," the fan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The running back should take the ball and run up the middle past "the hiker 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- An entire drive, one play to supposedly set up the next all the way to a 
touchdown. The fan submitting it said worked great for his high school team in 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of fans' suggestions that have been used: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Don Bailey faked a handoff to the halfback as fullback Burnell 
Harvin headed up the middle, turned right and did a buttonhook about six yards 
upfield. Bailey overthrew him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A naked bootleg by quarterback Darren Del'Andrae on a two-point conversion. 
He didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Fans can pick up forms at a chain of local sporting-goods stores. The stores 
give a $10 gift certificate for every yard the chosen play gains, $20 if it 
results in a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Some people get downright serious about their pet plays. One person inserted 
the names of the starters on the forms, except at one guard, who would have to 
pull on the running play. There, the backup was substituted. "He's quicker to 
the outside," the guy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Next! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good Night's Dip 
</P>
<P>
About that sleepwalking . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pokey usually takes midnight strolls about nine or 10 times a year, about half 
a dozen of which are during football season because of tension, he says, which 
indicates how serious he really is about the job. 
</P>
<P>
The time he walked into the water, Allen says, he pulled himself out and walked 
back to the bedroom. Didn't realize what had happened until morning, when he 
woke up with wet nightclothes and saw the tracks leading from the boat slip. 
</P>
<P>
Pokey's nocturnal wanderings may strike some as strange, but he doesn't mind 
talking about his sleepwalking. Heck, it may even generate some publicity for 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we're good coaches and players at the Division II level," Allen said. 
"We kind of enjoy the attention, and it helps Portland. Maybe they could hire 
us over at the Chamber of Commerce." 
</P>
<P>
What would you do for them? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Pokey said. "Ask Weaver."

SEARCH COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS SCHILLER; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPICS: SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE COMMISSIONER IS EXPECTED TO BE NAMED, FOR THE 
SECOND TIME, AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNITED STATES OLYMPIC COMMITTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A search committee unanimously voted Wednesday to recommend that Harvey 
Schiller return as the U.S. Olympic Committee's executive director, confident 
that his second term will last longer than the 19 days of his first one in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schiller still must be approved by the USOC's executive board next 
week in a meeting at Denver, his appointment is considered a foregone 
conclusion. He resigned Wednesday as commissioner of the Southeastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Schiller, 50, has been in that position since Sept. 15, 1986 except for a brief 
period beginning on Jan. 1, 1988, when he assumed the role of USOC's executive 
director. Citing personal and family reasons, he submitted his resignation Jan. 
20 and returned to the SEC. He said later that anxiety about a cancerous growth 
on his face had clouded his judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of his resignation, Schiller told USOC President Robert Helmick 
that he wanted to be considered when the executive director's position became 
available. 
</P>
<P>
That has happened sooner than anyone expected at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In February of '88, the USOC's executive board extended Baaron Pittenger's 
contract as executive director until December, 1990. He had been interim 
executive director for four months before Schiller's election, then officially 
assumed the position when Schiller resigned. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the end of the year, the USOC decided to begin the transition 
to a new executive director in 1989. In an interview with the search committee, 
Pittenger, 64, asked for an additional contract extension until December, 1992. 
Instead, he has been told that he will be asked to step down upon Schiller's 
anticipated election by the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the USOC, Helmick said that Pittenger has been asked 
to remain at the USOC's headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo., as a senior 
consultant "through his contract and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Pittenger, who is in Moscow for a drug conference, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
He was praised Wednesday by Helmick and USOC secretary Chuck Foster, chairman 
of the 10-member search committee. But it was apparent that the USOC sought an 
administrator who was more familiar with modern marketing strategies and could 
make the most of the $249-million quadrennial budget. 
</P>
<P>
Schiller supervised the SEC's marketing efforts, including corporate 
sponsorships and television contracts. He also was responsible for 
sponsorships, advertising and general operations for the 1986 Live Aid Concert 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
He has had a long-term involvement in the Olympic movement. While serving as a 
professor and head of the chemistry department at the Air Force Academy between 
1979 and 1986, he was actively involved in the administration of the U.S. 
Amateur Boxing Federation. In the 1984 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, he was 
competition director for boxing. He recently has acted as an adviser to the 
Atlanta Olympic Committee in its bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said that Schiller's credentials made him as attractive a candidate this 
time as when he was first offered the job two years ago. But Foster said that 
Schiller still had to satisfy the search committee during an interview Monday 
at Chicago about his reasons for resigning 21 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us that this was the job of a lifetime," Foster said from his home at 
Duxbury, Mass. "He felt that then and he feels that now. He stepped aside for 
personal and family reasons. But when our search started, it was apparent that 
he was one of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interim, he's re-established himself with the U.S. Olympic Committee at 
large and has general support from the national governing bodies of the sports 
involved in the movement." 
</P>
<P>
Schiller said Wednesday from SEC headquarters in Birmingham, Ala., that the 
obstacles that prevented him from continuing in the job in 1988 have been 
removed. He said that he is healthy and that his family is happy with the 
impending move. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help with the transition to a new commissioner here, but I'm anxious 
to begin with the USOC as soon as possible," he said. "This is the job that I 
wanted, and it's also the job I wanted before. But, due to circumstances, I 
wasn't able to do it then." 
</P>
<P>
Schiller denied published reports that he had been dissatisfied with the 
position in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that changes since have been made that will make the 
executive director's job more manageable. 
</P>
<P>
He credited that in part to recommendations submitted earlier this year by the 
USOC's overview commission, which was headed chaired by George Steinbrenner. 
Schiller contributed to the commission's report and has been actively promoted 
for the executive director's job by Steinbrenner, a USOC vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're asking whether the organization is different today than it was a 
year and a half or two years ago, the answer is yes," Schiller said. "Certain 
things came out of the overview commission that will improve the working 
relationship among the membership, the athletes' groups and the executive 
director." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said that he had informed Pittenger of the search committee's decision 
by telephone and believes that Pittenger will accept the offer to remain with 
the USOC as a consultant. Pittenger was interviewed last week by the search 
committee by telephone before he left for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Wales, a Cincinnati attorney who is honorary secretary of the 
international swimming federation, and Jack Kelly, executive director of the 
1986 and 1990 Olympic Festivals, were interviewed Monday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schiller has been considered the leading candidate, Wales said that 
the search committee was open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing I could point to that leads me to believe that it was anything 
but a fair process," Wales said. "I'm disappointed, but I wish Harvey the best 
and know that he and I see an awful lot of things from the same vantage point."

BO STARTS TO PRACTICE, MUELLER IS THE STARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things are getting thin among the Raiders, who are used to throwing out a 
backfield of matched Heisman Trophy winners in October. 
</P>
<P>
This year, they may be featuring a brace of wounded Heisman winners. Vance 
Mueller, who comes from Occidental and the other end of the publicity spectrum, 
will start Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Allen's injured knee, described as a two-week problem, may be six weeks' 
worth. The team is thinking of putting him on injured reserve, which would make 
it six weeks, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson is here and practicing -- although his annual news conference was 
pushed back to today -- but there's a question of how ready he may be. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Royal outfielder pulled a thigh muscle in June, which was one 
reason he stopped trying to steal bases. All but assured of joining the 30-30 
club at the All-Star break, when he had 23 steals in 28 attempts, he made only 
seven attempts (three successful) afterward. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week of the baseball season, he told a Kansas City reporter that 
his thigh was still only 75% recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Coach Art Shell says he is concerned about trying to force him 
into the lineup too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we've got to be careful about," Shell said, "we don't want to take 
this guy and push him in this thing. He hasn't had training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo will help us make the decision as to what he can do and where he can go. We 
won't in any way try to force him, try to make him the focal point of this 
particular game coming up. It's not going to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
"What he'll be doing will use muscles he hasn't used in a while. And there's 
the contact factor, also, you have to be concerned about. If he does play, 
it'll be a limited situation for him." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, similar circumstances existed upon his arrival last season, when Bo 
didn't start at Kansas City but entered on the second play, carried three 
consecutive times and wound up with 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Bo knows the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Bo knows coy, too? 
</P>
<P>
Approached as he headed out to practice, he pulled his shirt up over his face 
in a mock attempt to hide his identity, and kept walking. 
</P>
<P>
It was good to be back, presumably. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Art Shell said defensive end Howie Long may make his first start of the 
season Sunday. Shell was encouraged by Long's play at the Meadowlands in the 
Raiders' 14-7 victory over the New York Jets. "Every time the ball was snapped, 
he was double-teamed," Shell said. "His presence makes other players better." . 
. . Special teams standout Stefon Adams is doubtful with a hamstring injury. 
Center Don Mosebar is listed as probable after sitting out most of the last 
three games with a knee injury. . . . Shell, on the Herschel 
Walker-to-the-Raiders rumors: "Really? What are we going to do with all these 
running backs? Herschel Walker is a great player, but we've already got great 
players here."

The International Weightlifting Federation, stung by a fresh wave of positive 
drug tests, is introducing a controversial testing system that critics say is 
unfair and unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to adopt the steroid profile procedure," Tamas Ajan, general 
secretary of the IWF, said. "It would be a good idea if other sports followed." 
</P>
<P>
Under the system, created by West Germany's Manfred Donike, the amount of 
steroids in an athlete's body can be detected not only at the time the test 
takes place, but several months beforehand, although the drug is not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure has not yet gained formal approval from the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"If the IWF uses it, it'll be sued," said Arnold Beckett, a member of the IOC 
medical commission.

Minnesota Viking General Manager Mike Lynn visited Herschel Walker's home in 
Irving, Tex., to try to persuade the Dallas Cowboy running back to join the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him all the reasons why he should go to Minnesota, but we still don't 
have a deal," Lynn said. "I'm not disappointed, and the clock is ticking and it 
will continue to tick until Tuesday at 4 p.m. (the NFL trading deadline). There 
is no urgency in the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The winless Cowboys will play the San Francisco 49ers Sunday. Asked about his 
chances of still being with Dallas, Walker said: "Good, I reckon. Nothing's 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn talked about a trade with Cowboy officials and Walker's agents Tuesday, 
but Walker showed up for practice Wednesday morning. He was excused from the 
afternoon session and met with Lynn.

MAGAZINES: WOLFE STARTS A BOOK BONFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American novelists, get real! You're wasting your time, gang. 
</P>
<P>
While you've been noodling around with avant-garde, self-reflective, nouveau 
roman clones in hopes of impressing Susan Sontag, the Great American Novel has 
been smack in front of your face, wiggling its fingers in its ears, jumping up 
and down and shouting: Write me! 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what Tom Wolfe says in the November Harper's Magazine, and you 
can bet that penthouse intellectuals soon will be lining up at news racks as if 
Moses had just chiseled out an 11th Commandment. With good reason. 
</P>
<P>
America's most renowned popular culture critic's latest pronouncement is simply 
this: the Great American Novel of the 20th Century will be a work of social 
realism. And it will probably be about New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe should know. He attempted that selfsame big book in his fiction 
best-seller, "The Bonfire of the Vanities." And came pretty darn close to 
hitting his mark, he implies. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that even 20 years ago, as Wolfe was starting to pound out such 
journalistic benchmarks as "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" and "Radical Chic 
and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers," he was worried that someone would, at any 
moment, beat him to the punch. Someone must be out there writing a realistic 
novel that finally grasps the city and the era in its glorious, chaotic 
entirety. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, "To my relief, and then my bafflement, those novels never appeared," Wolfe 
writes. "And to this day they remain unwritten." 
</P>
<P>
For reasons Wolfe finds "bizarre and hilarious," serious American authors, 
sometime after World War II, accepted the academic truism that the realist 
novel was dead and struck off to pursue all sorts of effete and self-indulgent 
alternative forms of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wolfe himself was wrestling with the giants that fictioneers shied 
away from: "the racial clashes, the hippie movement, the New Left, the Wall 
Street boom, the sexual revolution, the war in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
But eventually he realized that his only hope for getting the "big picture" in 
his grasp was through fiction. Hence "Bonfire." 
</P>
<P>
In detailing his decision to switch forms, Wolfe sounds like the brilliant 
poetry professor who waits impatiently for a dull class to explicate a favorite 
text, then finally figures he'd better do it himself. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, it seems, the world has been painfully slow in grasping how very 
important "Bonfire" is and why. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe is least effective in his evaluation of why other novelists have been so 
foolish as to ignore the proper literary route of realism. His simplification 
slights the masters who set the alternative course -- James Joyce, Virginia 
Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and, later, Latin Americans such as Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez -- presumably because they weren't Norte Americanos. 
</P>
<P>
And Wolfe is at his snobbish, xenophobic worst -- none dare call it racism -- 
when he wonders if the fact that a nonwhite majority will soon rule urban 
America will "render these cities incomprehensible, fragmented beyond the grasp 
of all logic, absurd, meaningless to gaze upon in a literary sense." 
</P>
<P>
No, the task of the writer will be merely more difficult, he concludes with a 
patrician sniff, ignoring the possibility that ethnic diversity might just make 
America more comprehensible, more easily grasped by certain novelists -- those 
of color, for instance. (After all, "Bonfire" just might have been the Big One 
if Wolfe hadn't fallen so far short in his portrayal of the book's nonwhite, 
non-privileged characters). 
</P>
<P>
But even readers who decide that Wolfe's world view is prissy and bigoted will 
marvel at the dazzling case he builds for social realism. 
</P>
<P>
A big reason writers have feared the realist approach, Wolfe believes, is that 
they've seen that modern fact is much more preposterous and entertaining than 
fancy ever hoped to be. Not to worry, though. By developing the craft of 
factual reporting, as well as fictional technique, a good observer can at once 
capture the nuttiness of reality and wrestle it into manageable form. 
</P>
<P>
It was those skills that allowed Sinclair Lewis to write of the fictional Elmer 
Gantry, a flamboyant evangelist who gets caught in a tryst with a secretary who 
then turns around and demands hush money. And so it was, Wolfe points out, that 
Lewis "happened to scoop the Jim Bakker story by 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the example of 19th-Century French Naturalist (read realist) Emile Zola, 
Wolfe issues a cry: "At this weak, pale, tabescent moment in the history of 
American literature, we need a battalion, a brigade of Zolas to head out into 
this wild, bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping Baroque country of ours and 
reclaim it as literary property." 
</P>
<P>
Novelists had better soon muster the courage to take America away from 
nonfiction writers like him, Wolfe writes, or be prepared to abdicate their 
perch atop the hierarchy of letters. 
</P>
<P>
"If fiction writers do not start facing the obvious, the literary history of 
the second half of the 20th Century will record that journalists not only took 
over the richness of American life as their domain but also seized the high 
ground of literature itself." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the November Harper's is also full of literary fun. In one piece, 
literary scholar Hugh Kenner writes a simple, amusing celebration of the joys 
of computer networking. 
</P>
<P>
Another selection, in the "Readings" section, disproves the old folklore that 
every poem published in the New Yorker contains some sort of water imagery. 
Studying four months of New Yorker poems published earlier this year, Poet 
Charles Bernstein found references to "ancient pools," "midnight's watery ghost 
house," etc., in only 87% of the poems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
McMartin News 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens in the McMartin preschool case this year, the media 
post-mortems are certain to start rolling in. Without question, the analyses of 
the 29-month, $15-million case will be oversimplifications. It just isn't 
possible to make sense of that much testimony, delivered over that much time, 
without boiling down the information. 
</P>
<P>
In the October Los Angeles Magazine, Mary A. Fischer (with the help of former 
Los Angeles Times reporter Bob Williams) does just that. Her story is titled 
"McMartin, A Case of Dominoes?" But it's the sort of headline where the 
question mark is laughable. 
</P>
<P>
The writer is anything but hesitant here to pass judgment. Arguing that early 
reportage on the case fell into lock-step with the prosecution, Fischer comes 
down plainly in the defense camp. 
</P>
<P>
In making her case, Fischer does what she contends the prosecution did 
throughout the investigation and trial: She all but ignores anything that would 
cast doubt on her hypothesis. Still, the evidence, as she presents it, was 
convincing. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer concludes that the longest criminal trial in U.S. history was a fiasco, 
triggered by a crazy woman and kept tumbling along by a succession of other 
players including a police investigator, a social worker, a district attorney, 
a television reporter and a prosecutor. She raises questions about the motives 
and or competence of each of them. 
</P>
<P>
Her thesis is summed up in the magazine's subhead, another one of those 
spurious question mark statements: "Did six crucial players simply invent the 
longest, most expensive, most sensational -- and most trumped-up -- case in 
L.A.'s history?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book Lovers 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers who noticed some time ago that they stopped receiving the 
Florida-based publication Inside Books can rest assured: The remainder of their 
subscription to that short-lived publication will be paid off in copies of the 
West Coast Review of Books, a Los Angeles-based periodical. 
</P>
<P>
The publisher of Inside Books officially stopped publication as of Oct. 4, said 
David Dreis, editor and publisher of the West Coast Review of Books. "I've 
agreed to take on his (6,400) subscribers." But Dreis added quickly: "I'm not 
taking on any of his debt." 
</P>
<P>
No one could be reached at Inside Books, and Dreis said the publisher has 
closed his offices. 
</P>
<P>
The next issue will be West Coast Review's 15th anniversary issue.

SHE'S BAWDY, SHE'S ZANY, SHE'S PUSHING SAFER SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like an Italianate Dr. Ruth stuck on fast forward, Suzi Landolphi is skipping 
around on the lawn in front of the Cal Poly Pomona bookstore, talking sexy, 
flinging blue condoms into the air, having a marvelous time. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you just love that word?" she says. "Don't you think it sounds Italian? 
Gen-i-tal-ia. It's like an Italian liqueur. Let's see, you ordered the 
Amaretto, you had the Galliano and yours is the . . . Genitalia, right? You 
want it on the rocks or straight up?" 
</P>
<P>
Passing students are giggling hard, threatening to drop their books. Many 
decide to stop and listen as Landolphi, 39, all 5 feet, 1 inch of her, dressed 
in turquoise leopard-skin print spandex pants, a stretched-out T-shirt and 
high-top jogging shoes, steamrolls them with high-voltage sexual truth, giddy 
blasts of earthy humor and a simple but effective demonstration of the 
properties of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
She has been at it since January, making paid appearances on college campuses 
mostly in the East, talking about how to bring more knowledge and 
understanding, and less confusion and viruses, into bed. 
</P>
<P>
Her one-woman show, called "Hot, Sexy and Safer," arrived at Cal Poly Tuesday 
as part of that university's AIDS awareness campaign. It was the first stop on 
the five-campus Southern California leg of her national tour. (She is scheduled 
to appear at Cal State Long Beach at noon today.) 
</P>
<P>
The subject was safe sex, without the thou-shalt-nots. Landolphi did cover the 
list of ways to become exposed to and to prevent AIDS, but rather than dwell on 
the clinical, she went careening off into the more fanciful. Around the medical 
information was spun a wildly uninhibited sexual primer for the possibly 
bewildered young adult of the late '80s, awash in a sea of sexual anxiety and 
misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the whole essence of what I do," she says later. "It takes more courage 
and guts to practice safer sex, but it can be more satisfying. We're so quick 
to judge that if something's safer, it's not fun." 
</P>
<P>
Landolphi says that, for college and university students right now, AIDS 
prevention needs to focus basically on safe sexual practices, a fact of which 
school administrators are aware. 
</P>
<P>
"The administrators in the schools very much want me to talk about AIDS in 
relationship to safer sex," Landolphi says, but it's not called an AIDS 
lecture. "If we did that, no one would show up. I talk about AIDS, but we call 
it provocative and zany and we use comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Good sex is not limited to practices that can endanger one's health, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the sexual revolution made everything kinky again, everything we used 
to do in between. Nobody pets anymore. Nobody even says the word pet anymore. 
It's very satisfying, but no one does it. They go right to intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
The root of the problem, she says, is a seemingly universal lack of 
communication, honesty and trust between sexual partners, which leads to 
inevitable confusion, misunderstanding and fumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the country people ask me if there's any difference between people from 
the East or West, or the North or South. I say, 'Nah, people are having bad sex 
everywhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bad sex for Landolphi is sex that is unsafe, sex by rote, or sex that lacks an 
element of playfulness. It's that last one that is Landolphi's hook to focus 
attention on the others. She uses it to attract a crowd of about 200 in Cal 
Poly's University Park area within the first few minutes of her 75-minute 
ramble. 
</P>
<P>
There is practically no escape into euphemism for those who stop to listen. 
</P>
<P>
She explains, for instance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The essential differences among a number of condom designs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How communication between sexual partners can go awry. ("We need to start 
to talk right from the beginning. As women to women and men to men, we don't 
tell the truth to each other. Maybe safe sex is just bringing back honesty.") 
</P>
<P>
 -- How "there are 2,862 ways to satisfy both yourself and your partner. Know 
how I know? I'm up to 1,908." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it's pretty frank stuff from a woman who says she once wanted to be 
a minister. 
</P>
<P>
"I did end up being a kind of minister, though," she says. 
</P>
<P>
A former film and video producer, Landolphi began doing volunteer work with the 
AIDS Action Committee in Boston, where she was taught how to educate audiences 
about AIDS and its prevention. She chose to do her speaking in local high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
This January, she decided to escalate to college audiences, spruce up the 
presentation with comedy and lots of frank adult talk, and take the show on the 
road. She said she speaks at between 20 and 25 colleges each month to audiences 
that sometimes number 2,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a process Landolphi says is designed to break a kind of sexual 
logjam. 
</P>
<P>
"People will come up to me after a show," she says, "and say that they were 
just stuck sexually. Maybe they just didn't have the courage to make changes. 
Or all the talk they've heard is the old condom-or-a-casket stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Though her frank talk at Cal Poly occasionally caused some edgy laughter and a 
few averted eyes, the reactions afterward were positive. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very effective," said Douglas Lin, commissioner of programming for Cal 
Poly's Associated Students Inc., the sponsor of the event. "(The audience) 
responded a lot better to her than they would to someone saying that if you 
don't use a condom you'll die. It was lighthearted, but the message still came 
across." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, eyebrows do rise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get any (bad reactions) after I talk," says Landolphi. "I'll 
occasionally get it before. Some people think I'm here to promote sex and 
promiscuity. I'm asking them to consider getting more information based on 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one woman in Modesto who didn't mind my talking about intercourse or 
anything else, but she said, 'I can't believe you came to talk about 
masturbation.' " 
</P>
<P>
She says she didn't always come off like your crazy, bawdy older sister. Her 
Hot, Sexy and Safer persona "grew as I grew. It's an exaggerated form of me. 
It's part little girl, part brassy Italian and part professional educator." 
</P>
<P>
The current sexual mine field, says Landolphi, is "a storm, and we've got to 
hold each other's hands and take care of each other and go through it 
together." But, she says, there's no reason you can't have fun on the trip.

A LOST TREASURE OF GOLD RESURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The weekend after Hurricane Hugo hit the South Carolina coast, James Lamb, coin 
director of Christie's, the New York auction house, made a secretive trip to a 
Southern port city. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb won't name the city but will say that he went there to see what has become 
the talk of the coin community: the horde of gold coins and bullion pulled from 
the wreck of the SS Central America before the hurricane struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very, very exciting," Lamb said. "I spent (a day) down there. It was 
the most extraordinary day of my career." 
</P>
<P>
For Lamb, that's quite a statement. Among the numismatic experts who have 
reviewed the list of coins and gold bars taken from the wreck, 200 miles off 
Charleston, there is widespread agreement that the find is certain to make 
investors in the Columbus American Discovery Group wealthy indeed. The gold, 
unloaded recently from a salvage ship in Norfolk, Va., has been valued at $28 
million to $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There has never been anything like this," Lamb said. "One of the things that 
makes a difference from other shipwrecks is that the coins appear to be in good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
None of the hundreds of U.S. gold coins recovered, thus far, from the 
132-year-old wreck have knocked the coin community on its ear. The most 
impressive find has been the pioneer gold coins and bars, which were produced 
by assay offices in California and were being shipped East when the Central 
America sank in a hurricane in 1857. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven pioneer coins have been catalogued thus far, and the American Numismatic 
Assn. says eight of them, $50 gold pieces from the U.S. Assay Office in San 
Francisco, have the highest value, up to $20,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, that places the value of the individual coins well below the record 
$1.35 million reportedly paid for a 1852 $20 pioneer gold coin produced by San 
Francisco's Augustus Humbert. That coin was reported to be of mint uncirculated 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
What is making a review of the Central America's coins difficult is that many 
were discovered welded together by time and marine life. The salvage teams have 
not decided whether to break some of those coins apart to assess their value. 
</P>
<P>
What has excited most experts has been the large number of gold bars and coins 
from California's pioneer mints, including Kellogg &amp; Humbert, Harris 
Marchant &amp; Co., Justh &amp; Hunter, and Henry Hentsch.

The larger gold bars weigh 5 to 750 ounces each and are stamped with an 
assayer's mark, a serial number and the bar weight in troy ounces, the parts 
per thousand gold and its dollar value when the bar was melted. As of 
mid-September, the Columbus America group reported it had recovered 494.21 troy 
pounds of gold in bars alone.

"At the moment, there aren't that many of them in collectors' hands," Lamb 
said. "If you had any collector who had 20 of these, you had a great deal."

As for the hundreds of gold coins from U.S. Mints, "it's difficult to say 
without looking at the individual coins," said Stephen Bobbitt, a spokesman for 
the American Numismatic Assn. in Colorado Springs, Colo. "But Robert Hoge, our 
curator, says it doesn't look as if there is anything of major significance" 
among the coins. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-priced U.S. coin, according to the ANA's review, could be $7,750 
for a $5 gold "Classic Head" coin, produced between 1834 and 1838. If the 
condition is judged poor, however, that same coin could be worth as little as 
$250. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP A key to how much the find ultimately will be worth will rest in how 
the gold coins and bars are marketed. That question will require so much care, 
experts say, that it may be years before many of the coins even reach the 
market.

Police discovered the bound bodies of 80 murdered young Sinhalese men along a 
road in southern Sri Lanka, a day before the final round of peace talks to try 
to resolve ethnic conflicts that have claimed more than 16,000 lives. The 
victims, all between age 18 and 30, had their hands tied behind their backs 
before they were shot to death, police said. No one claimed responsibility for 
the massacre, one of the worst this year. But authorities blamed pro-government 
death squads seeking revenge for the murder Monday of three Sinhalese soldiers 
in Kalutara district.

Tropical Storm Dan pounded Manila and nearby Philippine provinces, killing 31 
people and raising to 149 the death toll in two storms that struck the country 
in less than a week, news reports and officials said. Carrying peak winds of 60 
m.p.h., the storm roared across provinces on the southern portion of the main 
Luzon island from the Pacific Ocean and swiped Manila as it swirled out into 
the South China Sea.

Pope John Paul II received a tumultuous welcome in the Roman Catholic heartland 
of Muslim-dominated Indonesia as he took his pilgrimage to the remote island of 
Flores, where 85% of the 633,000 residents are Catholic. Cheering 
schoolchildren lined the road from the airport to the soccer stadium where the 
Pope celebrated Mass before more than 100,000 people. The crowd repeatedly 
chanted in Indonesian "Hidup bapok Pauk" or "Long live the Pope." John Paul is 
on the third day of his six-day visit to Indonesia. His next stop is the island 
of East Timor.

The distress call did not identify the boat but said there were 18 people

Attorneys for state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya sought to minimize the significance 
of a superseding indictment filed against the Whittier Democrat, saying it 
simply corrected "defects" in the original 10 charges filed against him. In a 
brief statement, the law firm of Kelton &amp; Artan maintained that the revised 
indictment "appears to do no more than correct errors contained in the original 
indictment." The new indictment filed in Sacramento Federal Court by U.S. Atty. 
David F. Levi adds two counts of bribery against Montoya based on allegations 
already included in the original indictment. At the same time, one bribery 
allegation that initially had been cited in a sweeping charge of racketeering 
was dropped because it used an inappropriate section of the penal code that 
applies to executive branch officials. Lawyers on both sides of the case said 
the revised indictment does not substantially affect the case against Montoya.

Acting on the tip of a viewer who had seen a composite drawing on television, 
police found a newborn boy who had been taken from his teen-age mother at 
Sacramento's Mercy General Hospital by a woman dressed in a visitor's smock. 
The 6-pound, 1-ounce son of Ka Zoua Thao, 15, was found safe in a Sacramento 
home. Police Chief John Kearns said a woman who had worked as a nurse's aide 
and was familiar with hospital procedures was held for questioning. Her 
identity was not immediately disclosed. Investigators said the abductor took 
the infant after telling the baby's mother that it was feeding time.

HOUSE PANEL REJECTS FASTER REFUNDS FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday refused to prod the nation's 
utility companies into paying customers about $19 billion in refunds over the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are owed an average of more than $200 each, but will have to wait up 
to 30 years for refunds from gas, electric and telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows how powerful the utilities are in Congress," said Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento), referring to the bill that would have given state 
utility commissions the power to order faster refunds. Matsui co-sponsored the 
defeated bill, along with Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.). 
</P>
<P>
The dispute revolves around $19 billion in excess funds that utilities 
collected from customers to pay future corporate taxes to the federal 
government. When Congress enacted the 1986 tax overhaul, it cut the top 
corporate rate from 46% to 34%, providing the utilities with the windfall. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui originally sponsored a provision in the 1986 law giving the utilities up 
to 30 years to refund the excess charges. He now says that was a mistake, and 
sponsored the bill to allow stepped up payment as a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a simple matter of the public good versus special interests," Matsui 
said. "But I couldn't overcome the lobbying of this very influential industry." 
</P>
<P>
Utility companies mounted a determined offensive to preserve the 30-year 
timetable. Telephone, power and gas utilities, through political action 
committees, increased their political contributions to House members to a total 
of $5 million in 1987 and 1988. About $510,000 went to members of the House 
tax-writing committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill lost on a 22-13 vote, with 12 Democrats and one Republican on the 
tax-writing panel supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui said the defeat in committee probably dooms his effort to eliminate the 
special deal for utilities. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) has offered a similar 
proposal, but he carries little weight in tax issues. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure, led by Reps. Ronnie Flippo (D-Ala.) and Ed Jenkins 
(D-Ga.), argued that if utilities are required to pay refunds over the next few 
years, they might have to borrow to make up for the lost funds and thus be 
forced to boost rates. 
</P>
<P>
California ratepayers, topping those in all other states, have paid $1.9 
billion extra to utilities to offset the expected taxes. Pacific Bell led all 
utilities with $816 million in excess deferred taxes, with Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric owing $429 million and Southern California Edison owing $368 million, 
according to tax analysts.

INNOVATION: VIRUS VANDALISM MAY BE A PRELUDE TO COMPUTER CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm sick of viruses. 
</P>
<P>
I'm even sicker of the weasels who program them. Starting at midnight tonight, 
the so-called Columbus Day virus (also known as the Datacrime virus) will 
allegedly spring to life to destroy all the hard disk data on thousands of 
IBM-compatible personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Picture someone sneaking into your office and torching every item in your files 
-- letters, reports, memos. Everything. Multiply that by thousands and you have 
computerdom's equivalent to Hurricane Hugo. This current threat may be just the 
latest round of media hype, but IBM, AT&amp;T and the federal government are 
taking this virus very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The metaphor is apt: Viruses are little program-lettes designed to make 
computers sick. They're spread by computer telecommunications networks and by 
tainted floppy disks. This isn't like traditional computer hacking, where 
people break into systems for the heck of it. Breaking into a system to look 
around is one thing; planting a virus that destroys people's work is both cruel 
and malicious. 
</P>
<P>
To make an analogy, if a teen-age kid takes a car on a joy ride and returns it, 
he has unquestionably committed a crime, but his intent is clearly not 
malicious. If, however, our teen jiggered the engine to break down or explode 
when someone else drove the car, it's clear that he's a psycho who should do 
hard time. 
</P>
<P>
Too many of these creatures fancy themselves as the Jasons, Freddie Krugers and 
Michael Myerses of software -- they think that they're stars of a digital 
slasher pic. They mutilate data as mindlessly as their screen idols skewer 
teens. The computer networks serve as their masks and machetes. And, like their 
gore-spattered role models, if they don't get caught, you have to put up with a 
sequel. 
</P>
<P>
These virus sleazoids raise very important questions about the future of 
personal computing: Do viruses represent an aberrant phase or an ongoing 
phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
"Most people now understand that writing a virus is a genuinely bad thing," 
says Clifford Stoll, an astronomer turned network security expert who helped 
crack a computer-based West German spy ring. "Two or three years ago, it was 
possible to write a completely innocuous virus. Today, you can't, because you 
can't be sure innocent people won't get hurt. If a hospital gets a 'HA! HA! I 
GOT YOU!' virus that freezes up its computer, that can have a disastrous impact 
even though the virus is intended to be innocuous." You simply can't know what 
systems a virus will infect anymore. 
</P>
<P>
My belief is that, as with folks who love slasher flicks, we are dealing with a 
declining quantity of deviants. The overwhelming majority of computerniks are 
more intent on demonstrating how clever they are rather than how destructive 
they can be. Novelty, not perversion, intrigues them. These folks may still be 
inclined to take a Cray supercomputer for a joy ride if they get the chance. 
Troublemakers? Yes, but the focus isn't viral vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, viruses are fading as a hot topic among computer cognoscenti. 
"The virus is pretty much over," asserts Donn Parker, a longtime computer 
security expert at SRI International in Palo Alto. "The real question is, what 
will the next crimeoid be?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the right question because truly gifted (and dangerous) technoids find 
virgin technology more intriguing than yesterday's hack. Parker suggests that 
"voice mail hacking" may become the the next focus for malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of companies now rely on voice mail answering systems for eliminating 
telephone tag and speeding internal corporate communications. It's not that 
difficult to get into these systems and eavesdrop on and play back all the 
messages. Similarly, pranksters can use the technology to "broadcast" messages 
to all the phones in the company. Parker notes cases of voice mail terrorism 
where sickos use the knowledge they have gleaned from eavesdropping to 
broadcast threatening messages to individuals' phones. 
</P>
<P>
The point isn't that there are always sickos, it's that new technologies always 
invite experimentation. In the 1950s, it was hot-rodding and joy rides; in the 
1960s, it was psychedelic drugs; in the 1970s, it was telephone's blue box 
bandits, and the 1980s have seen the PC hackers and mini-plague of destructive 
viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's obvious that viruses such as Datacrime are slash-and-burn programs. 
There's no ambiguity surrounding them. My big fear is that the cleverer 
computerniks will move into the hazy arena of merry pranksterism and infect 
systems in ways they might consider clever or elegant. 
</P>
<P>
To wit, suppose this newspaper's computer system was infected with a virus that 
randomly deleted the word "not" from news stories and editorials? How about a 
"Robin Hood" virus that conned ATM machines into spewing out more money than 
requested after every Nth transaction? Not only would these viruses be 
difficult to detect, they probably wouldn't stir the sort of public/media 
outrage that other viruses do. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the sharp computerniks now enforce a code of honor that 
respects the clever and mischievous hack over the insidious and destructive 
virus. That is unlikely to change. The real risk is that really clever people 
will get caught up with how really clever they can be and blur the distinctions 
between pranks and vandalism. The next 48 hours may tell us a lot about the 
next few years.

Two Contractors May Rescue Ferranti: Two of Europe's biggest defense 
electronics contractors, Thomson-CSF of France and British Aerospace PLC, said 
they were considering a bid to rescue Britain's troubled Ferranti company. 
Thomson-CSF and British Aerospace, in a statement released in Paris and London, 
said an offer would aim to uphold Ferranti's position as a principal British 
defense equipment supplier. Ferranti International Signal PLC last month said 
it was the victim of serious fraud involving phantom contracts that would cause 
it to write off $300 million. The company, which specializes in military 
electronics, said the costly fraud involved contracts of its U.S. subsidiary, 
ISC Technologies, based in Lancaster, Pa.

PACKAGING EXPO TAKES WRAPPER OFF NEW IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 7,200 conventioneers who gathered in Anaheim Wednesday for a packaging 
industry exposition didn't look like they were under attack. The demonstrations 
of wrapping, stuffing and labeling machines seemed to proceed unhindered, and 
the racks of plastic bottles, cardboard cartons and foam insulators were not 
being visibly assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
But any doubts that the industry has an image problem were quickly put to rest 
by the latest cover story in Packaging magazine: Packaging Under Attack. Rising 
concern about the environment -- and especially about the ever-growing 
mountains of garbage that have nowhere to go -- has jolted the $70-billion 
packaging industry, and companies from bottle makers to label-printers are 
trying to adjust to a new climate. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an immense consciousness about this now," said William Pflaum, 
executive director of the Institute of Packaging Professionals. "We are 
committed to the traditional role of packaging, but we're also concerned about 
the environment." 
</P>
<P>
That concern, many in the industry concede, is relatively new, spurred by fear 
of a consumer backlash against products perceived to be environmentally unsound 
as well as a desire to head off legislation that might ban packages that are 
non-recyclable and non-biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our heads in the sand, but we're trying to reverse that," said John 
McKernan, director of marketing at Setco, a large Anaheim-based firm that 
manufactures plastic bottles for everything from shampoo to spice. "We are 
threatened by irresponsible legislative action, and we have an image problem, 
and we are trying to educate the public . . . and educate the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic bottles, McKernan said, can in almost all cases be recycled just as 
glass or aluminum can, and the company is now trying to develop workable 
methods of getting the plastic bottles back from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon E. Hart, legislative representative of the Sierra Club, drew grimaces 
from assembled packaging professionals when he suggested that a lot of 
packaging products were not necessary to protect and preserve products. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said legislation is necessary to provide incentives for reducing the 
amount of waste contained in packages. He suggested by way of example a 
per-unit fee on all packages, with a higher fee for those that cannot be 
recycled. 
</P>
<P>
And recycling, he emphasized, is not a complete answer; reducing the amount of 
waste that is produced to begin with is equally critical. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum of the Institute for Packaging Professionals said industry was not 
necessarily completely opposed to legislation, but that it wanted desperately 
to avoid having different sets of regulations in different jurisdictions.

Polygram Acquiring A&amp;M's Real Estate: The Polygram unit of Dutch-based N. 
V. Philips said at a New York news conference that it has agreed to buy 
privately held A&amp;M Records for about $500 million. Polygram, which says it 
is the world's third-largest music group, will acquire A&amp;M's record 
operations plus its music video interests, its Los Angeles offices, including 
the former Charlie Chaplin film studios, and the A&amp;M recording studio. 
Earlier reports speculated that the real estate would not be included in the 
deal.

CalFed to Sell Insurer: CalFed Inc. said it agreed to sell Anglo American 
Insurance Co., a London-based property casualty business, for about $100 
million to John Head &amp; Associates, a New York merchant banking company. 
CalFed, the Los Angeles parent of California Federal Bank, started Anglo 
American in 1987, injecting $80 million into the firm. CalFed said the sale 
must be approved by the British Department of Trade and Industry.

NEW SEC CHIEF NOW MUST PICK A 'TOP COP'

One of the first tasks facing Richard C. Breeden, sworn in Wednesday as 24th 
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will be to name a new 
enforcement chief, and many expect him to draw from within SEC ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Top contenders for the highly visible job are the SEC's three assistant 
directors of enforcement -- William McLucas, John Sturc and Joseph Goldstein -- 
SEC and industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Called the triumvirate, these men have rotated the directorship weekly since 
Gary Lynch stepped down, and they have won industry praise for their 
competence. 
</P>
<P>
Chief SEC trial attorney Thomas Newkirk also is a strong candidate, said SEC 
and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
"All are experienced, all are tough-minded and proven in the heat of battle, 
and all would be not much change from the Lynch era," said securities lawyer 
John Stoppleman. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch resigned in July after three years as the SEC's chief enforcement 
director to work at the New York law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell. 
</P>
<P>
The job of Wall Street's "top cop" is much coveted in the federal government. 
Its high-profile cases of corruption and manipulation in the nation's financial 
markets are often headline news. 
</P>
<P>
While Lynch was in power, he spearheaded the investigation that helped federal 
prosecutors put powerful stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky behind bars, and a 
98-count indictment was brought against junk bond mastermind Michael Milken of 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"Any lawyer who had the opportunity would love the job," said Newkirk, 47, when 
asked if he was interested. He has four years of SEC experience and before that 
was deputy general counsel at the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
McLucas, 39, a 12-year veteran of the SEC enforcement division, also confirmed 
that he would be interested in the position. Goldstein and Sturc did not return 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very capable people inside," whose depth of experience in major 
cases such as the Milken one Breeden may wish to tap, said Richard Phillips, a 
lawyer with Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
But one securities lawyer said the new chairman may prefer fresh blood to 
ensure he has a director with a broad range of legal experience. 
</P>
<P>
The only outsiders' names to circulate are two lawyers well-known for their 
work before the SEC -- Robert Romano of the New York firm Morgan Lewis &amp; 
Bockius and Robert McCaw of Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering. 
</P>
<P>
Romano said he would not apply for the position and has not been asked to 
submit his name. 
</P>
<P>
But a senior SEC official has mentioned Romano, the SEC's chief trial attorney 
from 1980-83, as a possible candidate, an industry source said. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw did not return several telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden also has SEC commissioner jobs to fill.

CARTIER TO OFFER CIGARETTE WORTHY OF RODEO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cartier has plans for a diamond in the puff. 
</P>
<P>
A pricey cigarette bearing the Cartier name and logo -- once reserved for the 
likes of fine jewelry -- makes its American debut in the Los Angeles area this 
week. The cigarette already is sold in Europe. If enough Los Angeles area 
smokers buy it, Cartier cigarettes will eventually be sold in other U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The brand, which will come in specially designed packs with Cartier's familiar 
"double C" logo, will be made in the United States by Philip Morris under a 
licensing agreement with the French company, House of Cartier. Executives say 
the brand will cost about twice the price of conventional cigarettes -- more 
than $3 per pack. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not for everyone," said Ellen Merlo, vice president of marketing services 
for Philip Morris U.S.A. Indeed, Cartier won't even be sold at the corner 
drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
The company says Cartier cigarettes will be sold mostly in luxury hotels, fine 
restaurants and at tobacco specialty stores. It will also be delivered -- by 
the carton -- to smokers with major credit cards who want the swanky cigarettes 
sent to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone plans on placing an order. "Smoking is no longer seen 
as sophisticated in America," said John F. Banzhaf III, executive director of 
the Washington-based anti-smoking lobby, Action on Smoking and Health. "Cartier 
must think cigarette smokers are pretty stupid," he said. "What are Cartier 
smokers going to get -- cancer at twice the price?'

STOCKS PRICES SLIP AS TRADERS CASH IN GAINS

<P>
Stock prices declined for the second straight session Wednesday in selling 
attributed to new worries about interest rates and uneasiness about pending and 
rumored buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 6.08 Tuesday, dropped 
another 11.97 points to 2,773.36. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 2 to 1 in nationwide 
trading of shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The market got off to a shaky start after Japan announced a higher discount 
rate, a move that signaled concern about inflation and surprised traders. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders also found it hard to resist the temptation to cash in 
gains from the market's rise to record highs last week and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a dimming of hope that 
the Federal Reserve Board will relax its credit policy any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days in anticipation of 
stimulus from the Fed, rose in Wednesday credit-market activity. Hope for lower 
rates had been one reason for the market's recent robust gains. 
</P>
<P>
"I would attribute this (market weakness) to (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan," 
said James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott. 
"His remarks were absolutely negative, and people are just now realizing what 
he's saying." 
</P>
<P>
High interest rates choke off investment and make stocks less attractive than 
bonds and other, more liquid assets such as money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said the market was due for a pullback and that Greenspan's 
comments just provided a timely excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market was a little overly aggressively bought earlier this week, 
and this is a technical setback," said Lewis Smith, a technical analyst at Bear 
Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
On the mergers and acquisitions front, AMR shares fell 4 1/4, to 97 1/8, in 
active trading, on word that the company was asking for legislation to help it 
ward off investor Donald J. Trump's takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
In other airline stocks, USAir Group fell 2 5/8, to 46 1/2, and Delta Air Lines 
was down 2 5/8, at 77 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Ramada Inc. fell 2 1/4, to 11. The company said it was taking off the market an 
offering of debt securities that had been part of its restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
Gulf States Utilities, the most traded issue on the Big Board, tumbled 2 1/8, 
to 12 1/8. A Louisiana judge rejected the company's attempt to raise 
electricity rates to cover $1.4 billion in costs associated with a nuclear 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1/4 at 45, American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/2 at 42 1/2, International Paper, down 1 at 
54 3/4, and International Business Machines, down 1/2 at 107 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 164.07 million shares, up from 147.56 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise hike in Japan's discount rate threw the Tokyo stock market for a 
loop, but it landed nearly right side up and investors said the market would be 
back on track after a few days. The Nikkei index of 225 key issues plunged 
370.60 points on news of the rate rise, but closed just 136.28 points off, at 
35,240.07. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed unchanged, largely due to gains in key blue chip 
stocks rather than any change in sentiment about Britain's high interest rates 
or the weak pound. The Financial Times 100-share index closed at 2,218.8, 
unchanged from Tuesday's closing. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices declined Wednesday in dull trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell about 1/2 point, or $5 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, 
jumped to 8.05% from 8.01% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some traders continued to take advantage of gains from last 
week's rally, but there were no fresh developments to affect the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going on in our market," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president 
at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "It doesn't seem to want to move; it needs new 
information to move it one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
Market participants were looking forward to Friday's scheduled government 
report on September wholesale prices as a potential factor in bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
Traders are "looking with some apprehension" toward the report, said John 
Sebastian, executive vice president of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in 
Chicago. If the data show a resurgence of inflationary pressures, they could 
knock down bond prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues slipped 1/32 point to 1/16 point; intermediate maturities declined 3/32 
point to 5/16 point and long-term issues fell 9/32 point to 1/2 point, 
according to figures from Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
Movement of one point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, 
was quoted late in the day at 8.813%, down from 8.875% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork belly futures climbed sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
boosted by stronger cash markets, shrinking supplies and bullish technical 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, livestock, energy and precious metals were mostly 
higher and grain futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork bellies settled 1.10 to 1.22 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in February at 47.72 cents a pound. The rally erased most of the 
losses of the three previous sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Pork belly prices have been recovering slowly since early September. They slid 
to 18-year lows during the summer as supplies piled up in warehouses, partly 
due to declining consumption of bacon. 
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to add pork bellies to the U.S. program of food aid 
to Poland helped get the market moving again last month, as did a drop in 
retail prices for bacon that some consumers apparently found irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday reported a 2.4-million-pound 
decline last week in supplies of pork bellies stored in warehouses outside of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as anything, the bellies are getting energy from fairly good 
out-movement," said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc. in 
Bloomington, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle futures settled 0.10 to 0.35 cent higher, with October at 73.20 
cents a pound. Feeder cattle were 0.20 to 0.60 cent higher, with October at 
83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.30 cent lower to 0.40 cent higher, with 
October at 47.62 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures rose slightly. Silver made substantial gains on New York's 
Commodity Exchange. Analysts said the silver price had been due for a 
correction since it fell 23 cents an ounce in the last four sessions.

The Commerce Department issued a final ruling Wednesday that Japan and Taiwan 
were "dumping" some telephone equipment on the U.S. market, paving the way for 
possible permanent import duties. 
</P>
<P>
The department issued a preliminary dumping ruling July 27. It said small 
business telephone systems and some components were being sold at far less than 
fair value. 
</P>
<P>
It began assessing temporary anti-dumping duties in July and those would be 
made permanent if the International Trade Commission, a U.S. agency, issues a 
final ruling that the dumping was injuring American firms that make similar 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The ITC, an independent agency that monitors adherence to U.S. trade law, has 
45 days to act. 
</P>
<P>
It ruled provisionally last February that U.S. companies were in danger of 
being injured by the imports. 
</P>
<P>
The ITC and the Commerce Department acted on a complaint by American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial Corp. of Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean firms were included in the complaint, but one of them requested an 
extention and as a matter of routine was granted a delay, to Dec. 18, a 
department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The department said imports of the equipment in 1988 totaled $776 million from 
Japan, $342 million from Taiwan and $227 million from South Korea.

CHASE SAYS $1.1-BILLION LOSS CAUSED BY BOOSTING RESERVES

Chase Manhattan Corp., the second-largest U.S. banking company, kicked off the 
third-quarter earnings reporting period Wednesday by disclosing a $1.1-billion 
loss, owing to a huge charge for boosting its Third World loan-loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
However, excluding the special provision, Chase's earnings were strong, fueled 
by loan growth and trading income, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was attributed to $1.26 billion in after-tax charges for the increased 
loan-loss reserves.

Without special items and reserve boosts, Chase's third-quarter 1989 income 
rose to $151 million, up from $130 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter operating profits, Chase said, were helped by increases in 
net interest income, consumer and investment banking fees and trading account 
income. Foreign exchange trading income was lower, and expenses were higher. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 third quarter it earned $283 million, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
"Setting aside provisions, the quarter was confirmation of the high quality of 
Chase's core earnings," said Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.'s James McDermott.

Motorola Inc.: Third-quarter profit edged up 2% to $89 million from a year ago. 
Sales totaled $2.41 billion, up 20%. The Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and 
communications company cited strong sales in its General Systems Group and its 
Government Electronics Group. The results reflect a pretax provision to cover 
the anticipated costs of the voluntary severance program announced earlier this 
month and a decrease in the estimated 1989 full-year tax rate.

Mayor Tom Bradley, City Council President John Ferraro and Derreck Burney, 
Canadian Ambassador to the United States, were among the party of dignitaries 
who greeted Mulroney at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>

"There is a great deal that connects our two countries," Bradley said before 
the prime minister's plane arrived. "This visit is a great boost to our effort 
to strengthen our ties with our Canadian friends."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH, 17, SHOT AFTER CHURCH BASKETBALL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth who was shot in the head Tuesday after a basketball game at 
an Inglewood church, remained hospitalized Wednesday in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon Bradford of Inglewood was listed in critical but stable condition at 
Centinela Hospital after surgery, said Julius Mason, a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the shooting occurred about 9:20 p.m. after rival gang 
members were put out of the First Church of God on Crenshaw Boulevard when a 
fight broke out inside the church gymnasium. Beatrice Jordan, a church 
administrator, said a program for gang members is held every Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
As the fight continued in the church parking lot, someone pulled out a handgun 
and began firing, according to police. The gunman fled after the incident.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULES TO SHUT LOOPHOLES IN RENT CONTROL 
APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday gave final approval to an ordinance 
intended to close loopholes used by landlords to increase rents beyond 
city-mandated limits for rent-stabilized apartments. 
</P>
<P>
In an unanimous vote, the council approved changes in the 10-year-old rent 
stabilization ordinance that eliminate a landlord's right to remove apartments 
from rent control by making substantial capital improvements to the units. Also 
eliminated was a landlord's right to evict tenants while doing major 
rehabilitation work, then re-rent the units at market rates. 
</P>
<P>
New rules also were established for dealing with repair costs -- from new 
faucets to carpets or appliances.

STATE TO PROBE ELKS IN VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
BIAS: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER A LODGE VIOLATED 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF 2 BLACKS IT REJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state attorney general's office announced Wednesday that it will 
investigate whether members of the Van Nuys Elks Lodge violated state civil 
rights laws last month in twice rejecting two blacks who applied for membership 
in the predominantly white club. 
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a similar investigation into the Lompoc Elks Lodge, which 
rejected two blacks for membership last winter. That investigation was called 
off after the lodge voted last month to admit the men under new voting laws 
passed last July by the national membership, Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new laws allow lodges to admit members by a two-thirds vote. Previously, 
applicants could be rejected if as few as three members opposed them. 
</P>
<P>
Before investigators try to determine whether the club's votes constitute 
illegal discrimination, they must decide whether the matter falls within the 
attorney general's jurisdiction, said Verdugo, who works in the office's Civil 
Rights Enforcement Unit in Los Angeles. That means showing that the lodge has 
attributes of a business or that membership generates business advantages, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If investigators find evidence of illegality, they will present the findings to 
a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, who can hold a hearing to decide 
whether to order the lodge not to consider race in reviewing membership 
applications, Verdugo said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Davis, a spokesman for the 300-member lodge, said he was unaware of the 
attorney general's decision and could not comment on it. He has said in the 
past that the lodge is not racist and that it accepts applications from men of 
all minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected black applicants Wednesday welcomed the investigation but said 
they wished it were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous that this has come to pass," said Thomas J. Montgomery, 67, a 
retired state motor vehicles examiner who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor 
in the Army in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any idea that racism was so close to us here in the San Fernando 
Valley, in Van Nuys. I was shocked that we were turned down, and the second 
time was even worse." 
</P>
<P>
The other rejected applicant, Jules S. Bagneris III, said: "If the Van Nuys 
Elks are without racial prejudice, then they have nothing to fear from an 
investigation. It's not a big surprise that he is going forward with it. Where 
there's smoke, there's fire, and apparently the smoke was strong enough to 
warrant a full investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Bagneris, 29, is a Lake View Terrace resident and minister at an African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in El Centro who ran unsuccessfully against Los 
Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi in April. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), a lodge member who sponsored Bagneris and 
Montgomery for membership, said he does not believe the inquiry will uncover 
evidence of widespread racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a case of bias by the entire lodge," he said. "I think 
there are some members that are racially motivated, but I think they are a 
small minority. 
</P>
<P>
"A majority of the members that voted are in favor of admission," he said, 
referring to the second ballot vote of 34 to 19 to admit the men, two votes 
short of the needed two-thirds support.

ACCUSED TRUCK DRIVER FOR COCAINE RING GETS A LOW-PROFILE HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly drove a semi-trailer truck delivering cocaine to the Sylmar 
warehouse that was the scene of the world's biggest narcotics seizure was 
arraigned in low-profile proceedings Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Mendoza, 28, of New Mexico pleaded not guilty to charges of 
transportation of cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale. He was then taken 
to an undisclosed location, where he is being held on $9-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, three other defendants in the case were ordered held without 
bail in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. A fourth has a bail hearing 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities revealed that Mendoza was arrested Oct. 3 in an undisclosed area of 
Van Nuys after he left a residence under surveillance by members of the 
multi-agency task force that made the Sept. 28 seizure of more than 21 tons of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"He is believed to have been a courier, a truck driver, for this organization," 
Huntington Park Police Detective William Huffman said. "The trailer that was at 
the warehouse was his." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza's arrest -- the seventh in the high-profile case -- was kept secret by 
authorities for eight days. Both Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Curt 
Hazell and Mendoza's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Rita Smith, declined to 
explain why the arrest was not announced as the other arrests were. The 
attorneys would not say whether Mendoza has cooperated with officials, as some 
other defendants in the case reportedly have done. 
</P>
<P>
"That's privileged information," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
In federal court, Magistrate Volney V. Brown Jr. declared three other suspects 
in the case a flight risk and a danger to the community. Brown ordered the men 
held without bail pending their trial on a charge of conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's ruling came after defense attorneys for the three men said their 
clients had strong family ties and no record of previous arrests. The three 
suspects are Hugo Fernando Castillon, 32, of Sherman Oaks; Mauricio Monroy, 36, 
of Mexico City, and James Romero McTague, 41, of El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, McTague's attorney, Michael Pancer, said his client was being 
unfairly detained in a "lock-down" facility at Metropolitan Detention Center 
because of statements he made to narcotics investigators under "threats and 
coercion." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, both McTague and Monroy have been separated from the general prison 
population at the Metropolitan Detention Center because of statements they made 
to investigators concerning the case, Pancer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview outside the courtroom, Pancer vehemently denied that 
McTague was "a snitch." 
</P>
<P>
Brown denied bail after Assistant U.S. Attorneys Susan Bryant-Deason and James 
Walsh argued that the potential risk of flight among the three federal 
defendants was heightened by the fact that each has been charged with 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life 
in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also denied a defense attorney's motion to dismiss the complaint against 
the defendants on grounds that prosecutors waited too long before arraigning 
them in federal court.

HAHN STAFF DEFENDS DECISION ON BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staff of the city attorney's office on Wednesday continued to defend its 
decision not to prosecute Mayor Tom Bradley for alleged conflicts of interest 
as a City Council ethics panel pushed the lawyers to explain how they reached 
their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"What was missing in this case to prosecute?"asked Councilman Gloria Molina in 
the third day of hearings. "I don't know how else to ask it." 
</P>
<P>
Molina was referring to Bradley's relationship with Far East National Bank, the 
focus of much of the ethics committee hearing Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was paid $18,000 in 1988 as a consultant to the bank, which obtained $3 
million in city deposits in 1988 and 1989. Bradley returned the payments. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released last month, City Atty. James K. Hahn said there was 
"damaging" evidence that Far East benefitted financially from Bradley's 
influence, but he said the evidence was not strong enough to prove that Bradley 
intentionally caused the $3 million to be deposited in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
That evidence was circumstantial, Assistant City Atty. Charles Goldenberg told 
the ethics panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office determined that the circumstantial evidence was too 
equivocal "for us to have any reasonable chance of successfully prevailing at a 
trial," Goldenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
A key piece of circumstantial evidence was a letter sent to Bradley in January, 
1988, by Henry Hwang, chairman of Far East. In the letter, Hwang sought 
Bradley's help in getting deposits. The letter was forwarded to City Treasurer 
Leonard Rittenberg and subsequently $1 million in city funds was deposited in 
Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Bradley telephoned Rittenberg last March 22 and within hours 
Rittenberg reinstated a $1-million deposit in Far East and added another $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg said Wednesday that there was no direct evidence that the mayor 
"ordered the treasurer's office to do their machinations." He said the 
transactions might be explained simply by the "craziness" in the treasurer's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding whether to press criminal charges, Goldenberg said, "We make the 
determination about whether or not there is a likelihood we could win."

PATIENT RABBI; 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITAL HELPS PASADENA GET A TRANSFUSION OF FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virtually every Saturday morning, the new rabbi for Pasadena Jewish Temple 
rises from his bed at St. Luke Medical Center and walks a block to the 
synagogue where he leads the Sabbath rites. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so dedicated that I get out of my hospital bed to conduct services," Rabbi 
Gilbert Kollin said with a laugh, describing his weekly routine. 
</P>
<P>
Since July, Kollin has had a private room in St. Luke's fourth-floor ambulatory 
unit, where he is a familiar sight to doctors and nurses during the Jewish 
Sabbath from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes worry," he said half-seriously, "whether someone will make a 
mistake and plug a needle in me, cart me away and remove a vital organ." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, Pasadena Temple didn't hire a sick man -- Rabbi Kollin hikes 
halfway up Mt. Wilson each weekend with several temple members. However, an 
ailing housing market did leave Kollin in a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Previously the rabbi for nine years at Hollywood Beth El, Kollin this year 
accepted the pulpit position in Pasadena, assuming that he would soon sell his 
home in the Beverly-Fairfax area and move with his wife and youngest son near 
the temple. But house sales have fallen off sharply in recent months because of 
a glut of listings. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a problem for me because I don't drive on the Sabbath," Kollin said. 
As a rabbi affiliated with the Conservative movement, Kollin is not required to 
follow Jewish law prohibiting driving on the Sabbath as rigorously as his 
Orthodox brethren. 
</P>
<P>
"But I just never have driven on the Sabbath," he explained. "The core of the 
Sabbath means 'stop,' 'slow down,' 'stay where you are.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kollin commutes by car from his home other days and drives to Pasadena on 
Friday afternoon before dusk. The problem was what to do after conducting the 
Friday night service for the 475-family congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is no hotel or motel near here, and I didn't want to impose on 
temple families who live nearby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because St. Luke Medical Center was so close to the synagogue, Kollin went to 
the hospital's executive director, Samuel W. Pangburn. "I made a discreet 
inquiry about any available rooms on the weekend," Kollin said. 
</P>
<P>
Pangburn, also a new resident in the area, was sympathetic with the rabbi's 
problem in selling his house. "I had just gone through the same thing," 
Pangburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Since a room was usually available on the weekend, Pangburn came up with a 
plan. He offered free accommodations in exchange for the rabbi's chaplaincy 
services. "He calls on patients who have need of some support," the 
administrator explained. 
</P>
<P>
Kollin broke his Sabbath routine only on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, 
when he stayed with a family that belongs to the temple. 
</P>
<P>
But Kollin returned to Room 402 at the hospital last weekend and he expects to 
keep checking in weekly until the housing market improves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect for the situation," he said. The room comes with a bathroom and a 
cushioned, adjustable chair, and he is permitted to use the doctors' shower 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Kollin observes Jewish strictures against handling money during the 24-hour 
Sabbath by using a meal card in the hospital cafeteria. It's not a kosher 
kitchen, but the rabbi says he manages by sticking to fruits, cereal and the 
salad bar. 
</P>
<P>
Kollin does not follow the Orthodox tradition of avoiding turning on lights or 
electrical gadgets. And so, he can enjoy the television in his room. 
</P>
<P>
"I go back to my room Saturday afternoon for a little nap, then return to the 
temple for our 5 p.m. study group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
How is the bed? 
</P>
<P>
"Hard as a rock," the rabbi confessed, "but you're not going to hear me 
complain."

STAKES ARE HIGH FOR O.C. IN HIGHWAY FUND BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1944, when citrus groves and bean fields were the icons of an Orange County 
rich in open space and free of choking traffic, Congress decided to build a new 
network of federal highways that promised to speed people and cars to 
destinations in ways no one had yet dreamed possible. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 years later, the $122-billion, 42,500-mile system of federally funded 
interstate highways is all but complete. As gridlock becomes a daily reality, 
Congress is poised to begin the most significant revision of the country's 
national highway program in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
At stake for densely populated, traffic-clogged urban centers like Orange 
County is nothing less than the quality of their economic and social 
development, say local, state and national officials who are working to 
influence the new federal policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the crossroads," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), a member of the 
House Public Works and Transportation Committee, whose 43rd Congressional 
District includes southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very much a watershed," said Francis B. Francois, director of the 
American Assn. of State Highway and Transportation Officials. "And these 
watersheds come along once in a generation." 
</P>
<P>
The battle in Congress is expected to last at least through next year, and 
possibly into 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The lexicon of this transportation war will include buzzwords like smart car, 
block grant, demand management, HOV lane, transit corridors, congestion tax, 
mobility study, user fee and private sector. But in the end, the keyword is 
likely to be money. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the lack of funds . . . over the last several years, highway 
construction and highway improvement has been lagging behind, and of course 
Southern California feels the pressure," Packard said. "We're going to have to 
develop a blending of several approaches to highway funding." 
</P>
<P>
By way of example, a study released this summer projects that in the next 20 
years traditional local, state and federal funding sources will fall short of 
providing enough money to meet Orange County's transportation needs by as much 
as $12.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
To bridge the gap, the county must look increasingly to private investment in 
roads and transit systems, said Monte R. Ward, manager of government and 
community relations for the Orange County Transportation Commission. But 
current federal law, fashioned largely in an era of government largess, 
severely frowns on mixing federal money with private funds. 
</P>
<P>
Many Orange County officials said they want the federal government to loosen 
the strictures on the way local governments can spend federal highway and mass 
transit dollars. Instead of building roads, the federal government should be 
concerned with moving people, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking at is maintaining and upgrading our existing freeway 
facilities, and then looking at newer and more flexible ways of moving people," 
Ward said. That may include car-pool lanes, rail systems, ride sharing, work 
schedule changes and even home work stations, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"One day we are going to have to get out of our cars and move people in a 
better way than we are doing today," said John Meyer, the former executive 
director of the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, which are 
working to build three new toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
The current system of federal funding dates to 1956, when Congress created a 
special highway trust fund to finance construction of the interstate highway 
system. A separate account to pay for mass transit projects was added later. 
</P>
<P>
The trust funds are supported with receipts from the 9-cent-per-gallon federal 
tax on gasoline and other highway-related taxes. Eight cents of the gas tax 
receipts go to the highway fund, while the transit fund receives a penny. In 
the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 1988, highway fund revenues exceeded 
$12.8 billion, and transit fund income totaled nearly $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, the highway trust fund has supportedconstruction of the 
interstate highways. It also has paid for other state and local road-building 
projects through a series of complex matching formulas that financed bridges 
and primary, secondary and urban roads. 
</P>
<P>
Authority for the federal aid program for highways and mass transit, last 
enacted by Congress in 1987, is set to expire at the end of the 1991 fiscal 
year. The program that replaces it is expected to be a dramatic departure from 
the funding schemes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do now is look at what our transportation system should look 
like in the next 40 years," said one key congressional staffer. 
</P>
<P>
The process will begin sometime before Christmas, when the surface 
transportation subcommittee of the powerful House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee is scheduled to hold the first in a series of 
hearings. Packard is a member of the subcommittee, as is freshman Orange County 
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
The Public Works Committee expects to draft legislation early next year. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner is expected 
to unveil a national transportation policy that his office has been preparing 
since last spring. Legislation to implement the policy will probably follow in 
a few months, said James McCarthy, chief of policy evaluation for the Federal 
Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, McCarthy said, "What the post-interstate system will look like, 
we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no dearth of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress, including Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of 
the House Ways and Means Committee, want to increase the federal gasoline tax, 
not to build more roads, but to cut the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Congress already has adopted a practice of maintaining healthy balances of 
unspent gasoline tax money in both the highway and mass transit trust funds. At 
the end of the 1988 fiscal year, those balances totaled about $14.4 billion. 
One congressional staff member called it a "smoke and mirrors" trick to make 
the deficit appear smaller than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
Local and state transportation officials, as well as members of the House 
Public Works Committee, strongly oppose the use of gasoline tax revenues to 
shore up the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see them release the $14 billion they're sitting on right now. 
That's really our biggest concern," said Ernie Schneider, director of Orange 
County's Environmental Management Agency, which has road-building 
responsibilities. "We're in a desperate situation here . . . we need relief." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cox: "It would do irreparable damage to our national infrastructure to do 
what Dan Rostenkowski wants to do with the trust fund, and that is to steal 
from it. There is an important national need, and it must be met." 
</P>
<P>
Cox represents one school of conservative thought that favors turning over to 
states, or regional transportation planning agencies, large portions of the 
federal gasoline tax revenues through a block grant program. 
</P>
<P>
"To think there is any repository of knowledge back here in Washington about 
where roads ought to go in Orange County is to miss the point entirely," Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Without committing himself, Packard said the idea has some appeal. Even 
California Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), chairman of the Public Works 
Committee, has flirted with the notion of block grants. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech last month in Anaheim to members of the Amalgamated Transit Union, 
Anderson said: "One much discussed alternative assumes the creation of a block 
grant program, which would allocate funds by formula to urbanized areas, 
provide for ongoing funding for existing programs, and then allow the use of 
federal funds for either highway or transit purposes based on the need for 
increase in transportation capacity." 
</P>
<P>
But many in Congress are likely to oppose block grants because lawmakers would 
have to surrender much of their life-and-death power over hometown public works 
projects, several congressional aides said. "A lot of congressmen still want 
their name on the bridge," one aide explained. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, congressional representatives from rural areas are likely to fear 
that block grant money would flow to centers of urban and suburban congestion, 
largely at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a block grant program is not enacted, Orange County transportation 
officials said they will push Congress to allow them to use federal aid for 
highways and transit with much greater flexibility than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S NEXT 
</P>
<P>
The future of federal funding for highways into the 21st Century will be 
developed by Congress in a process to begin this fall. The process will begin 
with hearings by a subcommittee of the powerful House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEEDED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND COSTS 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission has identified the top 
transportation needs of Orange County during the next 20 years as three 
tollways in South County, the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway from 6 to 12 
lanes with transitways for buses and car pools, and repaving and signal 
synchronization projects on surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
But improvements would cost $12.4 billion more than revenue now projected to be 
available during that time period, according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
In thousands of dollars, through July 1989

QUAKE: It's a geological time bomb that experts say could kill 4,400 people and 
cause $60 billion damage. The catastrophic impact of a major quake on the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault is explained in LIFE, along with a two-page color map 
(N8) and a guide to making your home safe (N2). The good news: $33,000 has been 
raised for a unique plan by emergency physicians to stash medical gear at fire 
stations and schools and train doctors to react. "They want to be effective," 
says Dr. Robert H. Bade, the county's emergency physician, "not just helpless 
survivors."

UTILITY MERGER PLAN STIRS FEAR IN S.D., RELIEF IN SOUTH O.C.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A local group that opposes Southern California Edison's proposed merger with 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric recently unveiled a TV ad comparing San Diego's 
fate in such a merger to that of a man facing death in the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
An off-screen voice urged San Diegans to "get out of the chair and call 233-NO 
LA. Before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-hitting ad struck a responsive chord. In a city that prides itself on 
staying clear of the Los Angeles/Orange/Riverside/San Bernardino county 
megalopolis, the proposed merger has many business and civic leaders seeing 
red. Covering much of Central and Southern California -- though not Los Angeles 
-- the Edison utility giant with headquarters in Rosemead would, if it takes in 
San Diego, become the nation's largest supplier of electricity, serving 4.8 
million customers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor recently described the proposed merger as the 
most important issue of her political career. That assessment came even as the 
city struggles with drugs and gang violence, an intensifying debate over growth 
controls and problems linked with the international border with Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
To San Diego merger foes, Edison's bid to gobble up the city's local utility 
symbolizes everything that is wrong with Los Angeles, with its smog, traffic 
and crime. The intensity of the feeling among community leaders can be gauged, 
for example, by Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce President Lee Grissom, 
who derisively refers to Los Angeles as the dreaded "L-word." 
</P>
<P>
Many San Diegans took pride in a recent Los Angeles Times Magazine poll 
suggesting that many Los Angelenos would rather live in San Diego, where they 
hold the quality of life to be better. 
</P>
<P>
On the Edison/SDG&amp;E merger question, a Times Poll in February showed that 
San Diegans with an opinion oppose the merger by a 4-1 margin, with two-thirds 
of the opponents saying they "strongly disapprove." 
</P>
<P>
While most of Orange County is served by Edison, SDG&amp;E provides service to 
a large section of South Orange County, including San Clemente, San Juan 
Capistrano, Dana Point, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo and the 
South Laguna section of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, who is also head of the South 
Orange County Leadership Conference, said Wednesday that he knows of no Orange 
County opposition to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said: "I'm very supportive of this," adding that he believes that 
the change may result in lower electric rates for South County customers. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anderson, a director of the Laguna Hills Community Assn., said Wednesday 
that she looks forward to the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"I would feel more comfortable with Southern California Edison," she said. 
"We've had some problems with our (SDG&amp;E) services, outages, things like 
that, and I've been impressed with Edison." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said about a month ago there was a power outage in her area of Laguna 
Hills for about four hours, during which she said SDG&amp;E's performance was 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't seem to know how to get the problem fixed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many San Diegans tend to distrust Edison's management, the poll suggested. 
Although Edison executives have pledged to seek a 10% rate reduction for 
existing SDG&amp;E customers, the poll showed that, while 33% took the company 
at its word on that promise, 49% did not. 
</P>
<P>
Merger foes believe that the quality of life in San Diego would deteriorate 
should control of SDG&amp;E move from the utility's downtown office building to 
Edison's headquarters in far-off Rosemead. The merger, they argue, will 
ultimately drive up electric rates -- despite Edison's claims to the contrary 
-- and eliminate 1,000 local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans also fear that Edison will dirty the county's relatively clean air 
by boosting dependence on three under-used electric generation plants owned by 
SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"We might as well rename (the county) Branch Diego because that's about all 
we'll have left," Grissom complained shortly after the proposed merger was 
announced in 1988. "We need that corporate headquarters here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Division Town' 
</P>
<P>
Turning control of SDG&amp;E over to Edison would "clearly label San Diego as a 
division town," said Dan Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic Development 
Corp. "We would become the largest city in the United States whose utility was 
not headquartered within the community. . . . It (would be) a major mistake." 
</P>
<P>
University of San Diego professor Peter Navarro believes that the proposed 
merger would devastate San Diego by aligning Edison, generally known as a 
hard-nosed, pro-development force, with land developers who will build at an 
even greater rate. 
</P>
<P>
"I just shudder to think of what will happen," said Navarro, whose Prevent Los 
Angelization Now group hopes to place a growth control initiative on the ballot 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's labor, business, civic and consumer group leaders, who generally do 
not agree on many things, nonetheless sat down in the same room and created the 
Coalition for Local Control. Grissom acknowledged that he had never been in the 
same room with the Sierra Club representative or the leader of a San 
Diego-based consumer group that monitors SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, which hopes to derail the merger and keep "control" of 
SDG&amp;E in San Diego, is unfazed that SDG&amp;E is already owned largely by 
out-of-town investors. 
</P>
<P>
The merger has spawned other groups. One group supports the merger, while 
another was formed to oppose a possible government takeover of SDG&amp;E 
intended to thwart Edison's bid. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's new-found fervor for the utility industry surfaced last winter, 
shortly after Edison made its uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, for nearly a decade before the merger proposal, SDG&amp;E was the 
object of scorn in San Diego. During the early 1980s, SDG&amp;E managers gave 
serious thought to stripping the company logo from trucks and cars to protect 
employees from irate San Diegans who were upset by the utility's notoriously 
high electric rates. 
</P>
<P>
Why has the current love affair with SDG&amp;E blossomed? 
</P>
<P>
"We have the reputation of our city at stake," Great American Bank Chairman 
Gordon Luce said earlier this year. "I think this is a very unusual situation." 
</P>
<P>
Luce, a rock-solid Republican and proponent of the free-market system, has used 
acquisitions and mergers to transform Great American from a tiny San Diego 
thrift to a regional powerhouse with branches in California, Oregon and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Mergers 
</P>
<P>
But Luce, a native San Diegan, has set corporate etiquette aside and agreed to 
head the Coalition for Local Control. His opposition is based largely on a 
philosophical issue: Utilities, he argues, with their government-guaranteed 
monopolies, are unduly protected from free-market forces. Keeping SDG&amp;E 
alive, he reasons, would keep competition alive in Southern California's 
utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's business psyche has taken a beating in recent years with the 
departure of other large, publicly held companies -- most notably PSA and 
Signal Cos., which was devoured by Allied-Signal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But ill will caused by those mergers pales in comparison to the open hostility 
generated by the proposed utility merger. SDG&amp;E Chairman Tom Page, for 
example, who just over a year ago was hailed as a hero for reducing SDG&amp;E's 
electric rates, now finds himself cast as the villain for embracing Edison's 
takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
It will take at least another year for state and federal regulators to complete 
their reviews of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger is subject to approval by the state Public Utilities 
Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Both are conducting 
reviews that are not expected to conclude until late 1990. Their rulings will 
follow thereafter.

STATE'S LATINO POPULATION IS UP 2 MILLION, U.S. ESTIMATES 
</P>

<P>
California's Latino population, which represents one-third of the Latinos 
nationally, has increased by nearly 2 million since 1980, according to a Census 
Bureau estimate released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the nation's total Latino population has grown by 39% 
since 1980, rising to a record 20.1 million. Latinos now make up 8.2% of the 
U.S. population and have a population growth rate that is five times that of 
non-Latinos, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau spokesman Carmen Denavas said that half of the 6.7 million 
California residents of Latino origin are immigrants. Immigration accounted for 
about 50% of the national increase in the Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first estimate of over 20 million," said bureau spokesman Jorge 
Del Pinal. "It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980." 
</P>
<P>
While the Census Bureau estimate did not include specific Orange County 
figures, the National Planning Data Corp., a Los Angeles-based research firm, 
has estimated that the local Latino population has increased by 53% since 1980. 
Orange County Latinos totaled 286,339 or about 14.8% of the population in 1980 
compared to an estimated 440,117 -- about 19.2% -- in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos account for 22.8% of North County residents, while they represent only 
8.7% of the South County population. 
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report are estimates and include illegal immigrants. There 
are no precise figures for the numbers of illegal immigrants in the state or 
the country, and estimates of the number vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
California retains its rank as the state with by far the largest Latino 
population, followed by Texas, which is home to 21% of the nation's Latinos. 
Next are New York with 10% and Florida with 8%. The report also identified 
Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado as having significant 
Latino populations. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates are not prepared for every state because "Hispanics are not well 
spread out throughout the United States," Del Pinal said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mayor Tom Bradley joined with Latino leaders and 
celebrities to kick off a city campaign designed to encourage Latino youths to 
stand and be counted in the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends, tell your family that Hispanics must be counted to earn 
political power," came a message shouted not from the mouth of a politician, 
but by Latin American rock star Jose Luis Rodriguez, who attended the event at 
Roosevelt High School. 
</P>
<P>
And, based on the high-pitched screams of approval from hundreds of teen-agers, 
the words were well received. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, bolstered with $600,000 in funding, has joined forces 
with a host of community and civic groups to find ways to reach traditionally 
under-counted groups, including Latinos, the homeless and those who live in 
overcrowded apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have targeted high school-age Latino youths because the 
students can pass along census information to their parents and push them to 
fill out forms for the April 1 head count. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, schools in areas with large immigrant populations will 
be sent census lessons for classroom instruction throughout the campaign, which 
lasts until April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The official 1980 count missed as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos, according to 
federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that the largest segment of the Latino population 
is of Mexican descent, about 12.6 million. Residents of Central and South 
American origin total 2.5 million, while those of Puerto Rican descent total 
2.3 million and those of Cuban descent account for 1.1 million. The remainder 
are of Spanish or other Latino origin. 
</P>
<P>
While people of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group in the United 
States, they are not the fastest-growing segment, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimates from 1982 and 1989, the bureau said that the number of 
Central and South Americans had increased by 67%. The "other Hispanic" category 
rose 31%, followed by Mexicans, up 30%, Puerto Ricans, 14%, and Cubans, 12%.

JUDGE OKS UCI BRAIN SCAN OF RAMON SALCIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sonoma County judge has cleared the way for accused mass murderer Ramon 
Salcido to travel to UC Irvine this month for a state-of-the-art brain scan 
that could aid his defense -- if the university will accept him. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge R. Bryan Jamar on Tuesday denied a motion by Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Peter Bummerts that Salcido not be removed from the Sonoma County Jail 
without a special court hearing. Bummerts had warned that flying Salcido to 
Southern California could be a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
However, Salcido's defense attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, said 
Wednesday he believes a positron emission tomography, or PET, scan, a 
brain-imaging technique that can detect subtle brain malfunctions, could reveal 
that Salcido has suffered organic brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old winery worker could face the death penalty if convicted of 
killing seven people in the April 14 rampage. Salcido allegedly killed two of 
his three daughters, his wife, her two sisters, his mother-in-law, and his boss 
at the winery. He also is accused of slitting the throat of the third daughter, 
who survived, and sexually assaulting his wife's sisters. The killings shocked 
Sonoma County and prompted a manhunt that ended with Salcido's capture in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A finding of brain damage might help persuade a jury that Salcido lacked the 
willfulness and premeditation required for a first-degree murder conviction, or 
sway a judge toward leniency if Salcido was convicted, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials at the UC Irvine Brain Imaging Center, located on the 
outskirts of the campus, haven't decided whether to accept Salcido as a 
patient, according to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The center's director, Dr. Monte R. Buchsbaum, "indicated he didn't want to use 
this as a fishing expedition to try to find something" abnormal, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted some definitive data that there is some brain dysfunction, then he 
would go in and explore it further," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Buchsbaum was out of the country and could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he has evidence that Salcido may have suffered brain damage -- an 
electroencephalogram, or EEG, showing some disturbance in the right temporal 
lobe, and the fact that Salcido had suffered injuries, including electrical 
shock, as a child. 
</P>
<P>
The university's PET scanner, operated by the College of Medicine, already has 
been used by defense attorneys in two other trials. In 1985, Buchsbaum 
performed a PET scan on mass murderer Barry Wayne McNamara, who later told 
psychiatrists that he had been told to kill his family by voices on television. 
The psychiatrist testified that McNamara's PET scan was consistent with other 
testimony that the defendant was schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bummerts, however, said defense attorneys will have "a long row to 
hoe" in making such claims for Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a statement from him that to me is clear that he knew exactly what he 
was doing, that he had a purpose and that he tried to succeed in accomplishing 
his purpose" by the shootings, Bummerts said. "Proving this claim now that it 
wasn't premeditated is going to be a difficult proposition." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sonoma County sheriff's office is preparing to keep Salcido 
under tight security during the trip to Irvine. Sgt. Norm Hardin said even the 
date of the PET scan will be kept secret.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;

<P>
REACTION TO WETLANDS AGREEMENT EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of preservationists, developers and local officials hope to get 
their first hint next week of whether federal regulators are likely to go along 
with a compromise to end 15 years of fighting over the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition reached a broad agreement last May for restoring 1,000 acres of 
coastal saltwater marsh near Huntington Beach and, at the same time, permitting 
construction of thousands of homes along the environmentally sensitive 
coastline. The plan must be approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, 
which has generally prohibited development in wetlands areas. 
</P>
<P>
While allowing residential development on about 80 acres of wetland, the 
proposal would provide Orange County with one of the largest restored wetland 
preserves in the state. Environmentalists say the preserve, along the Pacific 
Coast Highway south of Warner Avenue, would be a critical nesting and breeding 
area for birds from as far away as Alaska and South America. 
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to the plan because we have seen the overall benefits," said 
Adrianne Morrison, executive director of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an 
environmental group that has fought to preserve the wetlands. "We have all 
compromised. This is the best offer. . . . I think the (Environmental 
Protection) agency has its rules but they certainly have the ability to be 
flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison is among eight leaders in the Bolsa Chica compromise who have 
scheduled a series of meetings Tuesday in Washington with federal regulators, 
White House staffers and members of the California congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Formal federal approval for the compromise is a lengthy process not expected to 
be completed before the end of next year. But the local coalition hopes to find 
out next week whether regulators at the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA are 
likely to look favorably on the plan. Under the proposal, Signal Landmark 
Corp., the principal landowner and developer, would make significant 
concessions to environmentalists. Signal, which bought the property in 1970, 
had planned a huge waterfront residential community with a 1,400-slip marina, 
restaurants, hotels and a channel to the ocean deep enough for boats to 
navigate. 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal eliminates the channel, the marina and all commercial 
development. It also reduces the residential construction, setting aside 51 
acres for a park. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents point out that the proposal would establish 1,000 acres of wetlands, 
more than the 927 acres the EPA has said must be maintained. An additional 105 
acres would be protected from development as environmentally sensitive or 
open-space, buffer areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping it will help us get some idea of how they feel about this plan. I'm 
saying hoping," said Darlene Shelley, Signal vice president for governmental 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must also be approved by state and local agencies, including the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors and the California Coastal Commission. The 
coalition is still working out details, but members said they hope to present a 
formal proposal to the board by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriet M. Wieder, who helped put together the coalition, is a key 
advocate of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe our efforts will be a role model for the rest of the country," 
Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of next year we want to see it off and going. I can't be any more 
definitive than that right now. We're just starting to crawl." ROSE ELLEN

TRUCK DELIVERY HOURS EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Modifying a proposed ordinance, the City Council has expanded the hours that 
commercial trucks can make deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Arco and Mobil oil companies protested the council's 
Sept. 25 action that limited delivery hours to between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., with 
no deliveries allowed on Sundays or federal holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The action came in response to complaints from residents who live near shopping 
centers and must contend with the noise from deliveries being made throughout 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
"Something had to be done to alleviate the problem for our citizens," said 
Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age. 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies complained that the new hours would cause a hardship since 
many deliveries are made to gasoline stations late at night. 
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the council voted 5 to 0 to extend the hours of delivery to 
include Sundays and federal holidays from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. Companies 
seeking an exemption from the ordinance must apply for a conditional use 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
The modified ordinance will undergo a second reading before the City Council on 
Oct. 30.

SILVERADO DAYS EVENT KEYS ON DRUG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A salute to "Drug Abuse Resistance Education" will be the theme for this year's 
Silverado Days, an annual Buena Park event sponsored by the Noon Lions Club. 
The festivities will start at 3 p.m today at Peak Park, with carnival rides, 
games and food. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of this year's four-day celebration include a canine beauty contest, 
youth parade, special bicycle raffle, boxing match and pie-eating contest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, members of the Buena Park business community organized the first event 
to promote their town. It was called "Home Town Days" until 1957, when downtown 
merchants, worried about the trend toward newer, more convenient shopping 
centers, decided to spruce up the festival and attach more of a Western theme. 
</P>
<P>
The event is not a fund-raiser for the Lions Club; profits will go directly to 
local groups. 
</P>
<P>
Peak Park is bounded by Knott Avenue and El Monte and El Dorado drives near La 
Palma Avenue. For more information, call (714) 826-5666.

MINOR IMPACT SEEN IN BUILDING FREEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Robert A. Curtis' proposal to freeze all new development in the 
city until its general plan is complete would have little impact on future 
growth, a spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co. said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still researching the issue, but 95% of our residential units have 
either been built or have already received approval," said Wendy Wetzel, the 
company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who presented the idea to the council Monday, noted that more than 
1,800 new building permits have been issued by the city in less than two years, 
and he says the proposal is needed to control development until the city 
completes work on its general plan, a land-use document that will guide growth. 
Curtis said he expects the plan to be finished within a year, and he advocates 
freezing all new permits until then. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many undeveloped areas of the city, and we need to keep them intact 
until we can put together our plan," he said. "Otherwise, what good is the 
plan?" 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who is facing the likelihood of a recall election next year, has 
tangled often and openly with the Mission Viejo Co. The company and the 
councilman split over Curtis' support for annexing Aegean Hills, a pie-shaped 
community south of Mission Viejo, and the company is helping finance the recall 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her comments downplaying the significance of Curtis' proposal, Wetzel 
said the Mission Viejo Co. would not take a formal position on the idea until 
it came before the council. If it reaches that point, she added, the company 
would make its views public. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has asked the city staff to prepare an analysis of his proposal within 
the next several weeks, after which the councilman says he intends to press 
ahead for a vote on the matter. JIM NEWTON

<P>
An unidentified man was struck and killed as he attempted to cross a busy 
intersection Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 8:53 p.m. when the pedestrian, described as being in 
his 60s, walked across the intersection of Puente Street and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Brea police said that the man was struck by a 1986 Chevrolet Blazer driven by a 
Chino woman. Initial investigations revealed that the pedestrian did not 
observe a "don't walk" signal, a Brea Police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The pedestrian suffered massive head injuries and was pronounced dead at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials are still attempting to determine the pedestrian's 
identity. Brea police are continuing their investigations into the incident.

AN HISTORIC FARMHOUSE IS RESCUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE BEL BRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old farmhouse in east Irvine doesn't look like much. 
</P>
<P>
Dirty white paint hangs from its sides. The weather has torn at the roof, 
taking a few shingles. There is no foundation or porch, because the house was 
built to be moved to farm plots as needed. 
</P>
<P>
But where some see a dilapidated tenant farmer building, others see history. 
For Judy Liebeck, a member of the Irvine Historical Society, the 
turn-of-the-century oak farmhouse was a rare piece of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Liebeck, a historical conservationist who has come to the rescue of similar 
buildings, recently convinced Irvine city officials to appropriate more than 
$15,000 to move the house from the path of the proposed widening of the Santa 
Ana Freeway near Jeffrey Road. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finding that more and more of these great old houses are being lost 
because nobody really cares about them. A freeway will take priority over 
something that has been there much, much longer," Liebeck said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is old in this city. People who move to Irvine from other parts of the 
country think everything started new and planned here. The last buildings of 
the Irvine Ranch are the only reminders that Irvine has a past." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when Irvine was virtually a collection of open fields and orange 
groves, James E. Irvine built the tenant farmer quarters to house the family 
that would run the ranch's lima bean operations. 
</P>
<P>
The first occupant, George O. Cooke, came to the ranch to find steady work 
after the California Gold Rush died. His family lived there until the 
mid-1950s, and the house was never rented again. 
</P>
<P>
When farming as an industry died, the house became an anachronism as rows of 
housing tracts sprang up. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the house has been reviewed for state recognition as a historical 
landmark, Liebeck said that she has found little sympathy from the city and the 
Irvine Co., which owns the house. The Irvine Ranch Water District provided the 
only corporate help: a parcel of land which will serve as a temporary site for 
the house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people at the Irvine Co. see the historical value of houses like this one 
but don't want to act on it because it would be a hassle to move them and keep 
them up," she said. "They are a big company, and I can see how they would 
rather build over them, rather then (relocate) them." 
</P>
<P>
In the next year, the Irvine Historical Society is expected to ask the City 
Council to save two more houses, but Mayor Larry Agran said he might be 
reluctant to spend more money unless the houses would "serve some economic 
value" for the city. 
</P>

"I don't know if we should undertake similar costs in the future, unless we can 
find a use for them," he said. "Could it house a real tenant farmer, be part of 
a model farm or help transitional families who have no homes? I don't have any 
problems in avoiding demolition, but we have to identify an economic or social 
return to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Liebeck looks to the city of Santa Ana as a prime example of old homes being 
restored. French Park, for example, contains homes representing a cross-section 
of styles from different eras of the city's history. Though the houses are 
occupied, walking tours of the neighborhoods are held regularly. 
</P>
<P>
While many historical structures are now being used for commercial purposes in 
Irvine, the society would like to see houses grouped together as in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a great idea to use them to help educate the community 
about Irvine's past," Liebeck said. "We need that kind of historical value. We 
could be doing so much for the community, and future communities, by saving 
these houses. Not many people grow up in a neighborhood void of anything 
historical." JOE BEL BRUNO

BLAZE CAUSES AT LEAST $400,000 IN DAMAGE

<P>
A two-alarm fire Wednesday afternoon caused at least $400,000 in damage to a 
Raymond Hills area home occupied by a 14-member family, including 11 adopted 
children, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the fire that started about 12:45 p.m. at the home 
of Pierce and Mary Ommanney, although a housekeeper and three others were home 
when the blaze started, Fullerton Fire Department spokesman Marc E. Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at the end of a cul-de-sac at 1400 Vista Del Mar Drive sent clouds of 
heavy black smoke billowing over the neighborhood. Thirty firefighters from 
Fullerton and Buena Park spent 1 1/2 hours containing the blaze, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the children, all of whom are school age, the Ommanneys are also 
guardians for a blind adult, fire investigator Thomas Thompson said. The family 
is staying at a nearby hotel, where they were taken by Red Cross workers. The 
Ommanneys declined to comment about the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The house has 15 to 20 rooms, Battalion Chief Jack Cooper said. The unusual 
two-story home, which includes a bell tower, was marked by intricate mosaic 
work on the exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is under investigation, firefighters said. MARY LOU

CORRECTION MADE TO WATER BAGEL RECIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The amount of all-purpose flour was incorrect in last week's Judy Zeidler story 
on Iz's Water Bagels recipe. The entire corrected recipes follows. 
</P>
<P>
IZ'S WATER BAGELS 
</P>
<P>
2 cups cold tap water 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
3/4 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon malt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
8 cups high gluten flour (12% to 13%) (or 8 cups all-purpose flour plus 4 
tablespoons powdered gluten) 
</P>
<P>
5 teaspoons dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
In bowl of electric mixer, using dough hook, blend water, sugar, salt, malt and 
oil. Combine 6 cups flour and yeast and add to bowl, blending until dough comes 
together. Add remaining flour, beating until smooth. (If any dry flour mixture 
remains in bottom of bowl, add several drops of water to moisten and continue 
beating 5 minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Transfer to wooden board but do not add any oil, water or additional flour. 
Cover with towel and let rest 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough into 15 pieces, each weighing about 3 ounces. Keep covered with 
towel while shaping each piece. Knead by folding each piece in half and pushing 
out any air-pockets. Then, fold in half and knead again. Shape into rope about 
5-inches long, then form into doughnut shape. Overlap ends by about 1 inch and 
knead into smooth perfect circle. Repeat with remaining dough. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle cornmeal on wooden board and place bagels on top. Cover with towel and 
let rest 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Fill large pot with water and bring to boil. Drop 4 to 6 bagels (do not crowd) 
into boiling water and boil 10 seconds only. Bagels should rise to top of 
water. Using slotted spoon, transfer to wire rack and drain. Then place on 
parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees 10 minutes or until golden 
brown. Makes about 15 bagels. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
Onion-Poppy Seed Bagels -- After boiling and draining bagels, press top of each 
bagel into mixture of chopped onion mixed with poppy seeds. Bake as directed. 
</P>
<P>
Egg Bagels -- Using recipe for water bagels, place 2 or 3 egg yolks in 2-cup 
measure and add enough water to measure 2 cups. Use as liquid in recipe.

SILENT KILLER: ONE IN EIGHT LATINOS HIT BY DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consuelo wishes she could share her First Communion this year with Abuelita. 
She misses her grandmother very much. 
</P>
<P>
Abuelita was not very old -- just 62 -- but there was not much the doctors 
could do to save her life. She had uncontrolled diabetes: her kidneys were 
failing, her blood pressure was too high and she finally died of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Consuelo and Abuelita aren't actual people, but their story nevertheless is 
played over and over again among the more than 3 million Latinos in the Los 
Angeles metropolitan area, health officials say. The reason is diabetes, a 
silent killer that afflicts one in eight Latino adults. This rate is higher 
than that of any ethnic group except for American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who 
already have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in 
the Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos 
about diabetes. The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug 
companies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can't be 
controlled by changes in eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
Like heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a 
condition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors 
say. Being 20% or more overweight is one of the major diabetes risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the 
adolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits," said Dr. 
Jaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes 
association's Latino education efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people think that when Latinos come here (to the United States) they gain 
weight because they continue to eat the way they ate at home. But in fact, they 
change," Davidson said. "What happens is, fast foods are readily available . . 
. and they are higher in fat and calories. And at home they didn't have a car, 
and here instead of walking we take the car to go one block. 
</P>
<P>
"That ends in having more obesity. If you have already a predisposed group of 
people, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes." 
</P>
<P>
With funding from Upjohn Co., the Los Angeles chapter of the American Diabetes 
Assn. sponsored a diabetes health fair at Olvera Street Plaza on Aug. 26. Of 
3,000 who attended the fair, 1,000 underwent tests for diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
More of this kind of effort and wider education among the public and physicians 
can be expected in the future, said Janet Matkin, of the association's 
California affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes is a defect in the body's system for using sugar in the blood. It 
results from the body's failure to make insulin or, some studies indicate, from 
its inability to use insulin that is available. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and 
incidence of the disease increases with age. In one survey done in San Antonio, 
a third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes, Davidson 
said. Latinos' higher susceptibility is thought to result from a combination of 
both heredity and diet. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, American Indians have the highest diabetes incidence of any ethnic 
group in the United States. Genetically controlled defects in the body's 
insulin system are also thought to exist both for them and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote 
obesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes that begins in childhood requires daily insulin injections. Most 
commonly in Latinos, however, diabetes takes the form called Type II, which 
first appears in adulthood and often can be controlled with proper diet and 
exercise. The disease tends to show up in the late 20s and early 30s among 
Latinos, a decade earlier than it does in Anglos, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
But, because it progresses slowly, Type II diabetes can go undiagnosed for 
years, allowing complications such as kidney failure, heart disease, blindness 
and the need for amputation of a foot or toe. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, who often have less access to regular health care than Anglos, are 
more likely to go undiagnosed, Matkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The new educational efforts to change that picture are necessary, not only 
because they help individuals stay healthy but also because the nation's health 
care funding crisis will only get worse if the problem is not reduced, Davidson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a problem that is going to grow, maybe at epidemic proportions," 
Davidson said. "In some states like California or Texas, if nothing is done 
we're going to pay so much money for health care for people of Latino origin 
that it may become prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
The number of Latino diabetics in the United States will nearly quadruple by 
the year 2000 to 8 million, according to projections by Eli Lilly Co. Caring 
for them will cost more than $10 billion a year, even if the disease has no 
complications, the company projects. 
</P>
<P>
Yet life-style changes today to cut down on obesity can prevent many of those 
cases from ever occurring, health officials say. That means adapting an 
Anglo-oriented health education network to the needs of a diverse Latino 
community that has a different social structure, health beliefs and eating 
habits from the majority culture. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the fact that Type II diabetes frequently shows up in women 
during or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to 
influence an entire Latino family's eating habits, said Dr. Martin Montoro, 
co-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Any Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider 
herself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent immigrants and even some longtime U.S. residents are not likely to want 
to switch completely away from a diet reliant on beans, tortillas and other 
carbohydrates, Montoro noted, but modifications can be made easily. One of the 
most important is to cut down on fat in the diet by eliminating fried foods -- 
for instance, by not frying tortillas for tacos or enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Other barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors 
interested in the issue say. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer 
information or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said 
Dr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Any physician practicing in Southern California needs to be aware of that and 
to learn to ask more diabetes-related questions of their Latino patients, 
Lifshitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on 
diabetes. He pointed to the recent indications that Americans' risk of heart 
disease is lowering as examples of how educational programs can work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we give them the opportunity and the tools that Latinos are no 
different than anybody else," Davidson said. "We need to give them the 
opportunity to enter the health care system, and we need to give them the 
opportunity to learn that diabetes is the biggest health care issue that they 
are going to face into the year 2000."

TONIGHT'S PREP FOOTBALL; 
</P>
<P>
IN DANA HILLS' LEAGUE, IT PAYS TO BE CAUTIOUS . . . EVEN AFTER A 5-0 START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When someone says a Dana Hills team is off to a 5-0 start, people usually think 
tennis. But football? 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins, who have finished out of the playoffs for 13 consecutive years, 
are trying to douse their pushover image in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills is 5-0 in football for the first time in the school's 18-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The football team's previous best start was in 1980 when the Dolphins were 4-1 
after nonleague play. "We finished 0-5 in league that season," Athletic 
Director John Klink said. "That's not an omen though, absolutely not. We have a 
much better team than we had in 1980." 
</P>
<P>
It might not be an omen, but it is an indication of how tough it is for a team 
to pull itself up by the bootstraps in the competitive South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
How competitive? 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, when the Southern Section began holding conference championships, 
South Coast League teams have been in a conference final nine of 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Dana Hills is ranked eighth in Southern Section Division III, 
which is something for the Dolphins to stand up and shout about. "Everybody is 
excited around here," Coach Don Douglass said. "It's like a new school." 
</P>
<P>
Although enthusiasm is at an all-time high, folks at Dana Hills aren't counting 
on a playoff berth just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'OK, you did really good in preseason, but here comes (the) season 
and you have to prove yourself all over again," Klink said. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of skepticism is the fact that three other South Coast League 
teams are ranked ahead of Dana Hills in the Southern Section Division III poll: 
Mission Viejo (No. 2), El Toro (No. 3) and Capistrano Valley (No. 4). 
</P>
<P>
There's more. Dana Hills will play the county's top-ranked team, Mission Viejo, 
at 7:30 tonight at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass, who is in his eighth year at Dana Hills, sees the early-season 
meeting as a positive. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is out there and you gotta accept it," he said. "You've just got 
to go after them. I really don't mind opening up with them. We're both 5-0. 
Let's find out who is going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer you wait, the more you worry. So I suppose we might as well get 
with it. We're playing No. 2 (in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. prep 
football poll) next week in El Toro. I would rather not play them back-to-back 
honestly. But I really don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins will send their rushing attack against the Diablos' more balanced 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission Viejo is very strong, very methodical, makes very few mistakes and 
capitalizes on other team's mistakes," Douglass said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't turn the ball over at all. We can't give them the big play, the big 
pass or the big break that could turn the ballgame around." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills has the county's fifth-leading rusher in senior fullback Matt 
Carvalho, who has nine touchdowns and 694 yards in 104 carries. Halfback Scott 
Perlman has 350 yards in 55 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Grant Taylor had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and 
missed the first three games, but led the Dolphins to their past two victories. 
He has completed 10 of 19 passes for 83 yards, one touchdown and five 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Mark Gaw leads Mission Viejo with 445 yards and 12 touchdowns in 68 
carries. Quarterback Don Disbro has completed 22 of 43 passes for 243 yards, 
five touchdowns and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (3-2) vs. Huntington Beach (4-1) at Orange Coast College at 8 p.m.: 
</P>
<P>
Things should be resolved early in the Sunset League. League coaches have 
selected both teams as favorites for the title. Edison's strength is offense. 
The Chargers have the league's most efficient passer and leading rusher. 
Quarterback Donnie Smith has completed 68% of his passes for 799 yards, five 
touchdowns and three interceptions. Tailback Shane Sherman is the county's 
sixth-leading rusher with 689 yards in 105 carries. Last week he broke Kerwin 
Bell's 9-year-old school rushing record for one game (238 yards). Sherman had 
307 yards in 31 carries and scored four touchdowns despite sitting out the 
fourth quarter of a victory over St. John Bosco. That was the seventh-highest 
single-game rushing total in county history. Edison's offensive line averages 
200 pounds, but the Chargers might be in trouble on defense. Edison has allowed 
105 points in five games. Huntington Beach has allowed just 38 points, 19 in 
its only defeat, a 19-14 loss to Mater Dei last week. Edison also played Mater 
Dei and lost 21-14 two weeks ago. Oiler quarterback Jeff Gibson has passed for 
558 yards and six touchdowns. He has been intercepted six times. The Oilers 
have a powerful rushing tandem in Doug Cunningham, second in the league with 
444 yards in 77 carries, and Jeff Dunagan (231 yards in 46 carries).

BRIEFCASE: TUSTIN COMPANY AGREES TO REPRESENT FIRM MAKING HIGH-DEFINITION 
FILMS;

<P>
Tustin-based Cameron/South Coast Group Inc. has just been signed to provide 
investor relations and counseling services to Showscan Film Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City-based Showscan Film is a fledgling public firm that makes 
high-definition films using the movie technology. Its process, called Showscan, 
was created by Douglas Turnbull, the special effects whiz behind "2001: A Space 
Odyssey" and the first "Star Trek" series, among other science-fiction epics. 
</P>
<P>
Showscan changes the speed at which film is shot. It is a patented, 
high-definition filmmaking process that photographs movies on 65-millimeter 
film at 60 frames per second -- rather than the conventional 35-millimeter film 
at 24 frames per second. 
</P>
<P>
The result is movies that just about everyone agrees are much brighter, clearer 
and more realistic than what is now playing at the local theater. 
</P>
<P>
But whether the Showscan technology becomes any more than the latest expensive 
gimmick remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Showscan movies cost a least $2 million to $3 million more per film to produce. 
And the effect is best in a specially equipped theater -- which costs up to 
$300,000 to convert. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Showscan with a Catch-22. Producers must pay more to shoot more 
footage in Showscan, but there are very few theaters (only one in the United 
States) to screen them. And theater owners have to pay to install Showscan 
equipment even though there are no Showscan full-length movies to screen. 
</P>
<P>
Showscan Film, meanwhile, has branched out into mock amusement park rides, 
using motion simulators akin to Disneyland's Star Tours attraction. Showscan 
vice president David Nassif boasts of contracts for 20 simulator systems but 
acknowledges that some of those are subject to cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, controlled by a group of executives who formerly owned the Plitt 
theater chain, had a $2.9-million loss for the last fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-person Cameron/South Coast office will work with Showscan Film "to 
expand the financial market's awareness and understanding" of the publicly 
traded company, Joseph Allen, president of CSCG, announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-year contract, valued by Allen "in the $100,000 range," 
Cameron/South Coast will develop and manage programs for Showscan to 
communicate with shareholders, investors, financial analysts and brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron/South Coast, which specializes in financial and investor relations and 
crisis communications, is optimistic. "Without national and international 
network of resources, we are well positioned" to boost Showscan, said Rene H. 
Caron, vice president of CSCG. Compiled by MARY ANN GALANTE, Times staff writer

COMPANY HOPES ITS FUZZY THINKING PAYS OFF;

COMPUTERS: FIRM IS FIRST IN UNITED STATES TO MARKET PRODUCTS USING FUZZY LOGIC, 
A FORM OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
You wouldn't expect a company with a moniker like Togai InfraLogic to be in the 
business of making, say, pencils or pin cushions. And, as a matter of fact, it 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling Irvine technology company develops "very-large-scale integration 
processors for embedded real-time fuzzy logic applications." In plain English, 
that means the company does complicated things with computers that ordinary 
folks can't even begin to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
Togai InfraLogic is the first company in the United States -- and until 
recently, the only one -- to market computer products incorporating the 
so-called fuzzy logic technology. A branch of artificial intelligence, fuzzy 
logic is an esoteric mathematical concept for solving problems that deal with 
imprecise reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuzziness deals with those shades of gray problems, as contrasted with the 
traditional yes or no ones," said Carl Perkins, a co-founder of Togai 
InfraLogic. "It deals with ambiguity and vagueness." 
</P>
<P>
The fuzzy logic concept was developed in the mid-1960s by Lofti Zahdeh, a 
Russian-born computer science professor who teaches at the University of 
California at Berkeley. Zahdeh, who has become something of a cult figure among 
fuzzy logic followers, is an adviser to Togai InfraLogic. 
</P>
<P>
Zahdeh invented fuzzy logic as a way for computers to deal with imprecise 
information such as "maybe," "probably" or "most" -- the kind of reasoning that 
humans do every day. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of artificial intelligence research is concerned with how to 
reason with information you aren't certain of, something human beings do all 
the time," said Nils J. Nillsen, chairman of the Stanford University computer 
science department. "There are many approaches, and Zahdeh's is just one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
And it's the one with which tiny Togai InfraLogic hopes to prosper. Founded in 
1987, Togai InfraLogic is a privately held firm funded by corporate and private 
investors in Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The company is named after co-founder Masaki Togai, a Japanese-born engineer 
who in 1985 co-invented the world's first fuzzy logic computer chip at AT&amp;T 
Bell Laboratories. Togai tells the story about how he and other Bell engineers 
tested their invention by trying to program a robot to play Ping-Pong using 
fuzzy logic theory. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent a lot of time on that, but couldn't do it," he said. "It's very hard 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
Togai later teamed up with the firm's other founders: Carl Perkins and Rodney 
J. Corder, ex-engineers at Rockwell International's semiconductor division in 
Newport Beach, who left to start a company specializing in fuzzy logic after 
failing to interest Rockwell in pursuing the technology. 
</P>
<P>
Togai InfraLogic has developed a fuzzy logic chip and software tools for 
developing fuzzy systems. So far, its products have been used primarily by 
Japanese customers in applications involving cameras, air conditioners and 
automobiles. Most of the applications are in the research rather than 
production stage, however. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concept originated in the United States, the Japanese have taken a 
big lead in fuzzy logic research and in bringing the technology into commercial 
products. Perhaps due to its oddball name, fuzzy logic is still considered a 
bit kooky in some scientific circles in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is now where Japan was about 10 years ago," Togai said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy logic is hot in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Entire Japanese television programs have been devoted to fuzzy logic, and 
Hitachi Ltd. has built a fuzzy system that runs subway trains in Sendai, Japan, 
200 miles north of Tokyo. Yamaichi Securities, a Japanese investment firm, 
recently introduced a "fuzzy fund" in which stocks are traded using a fuzzy 
logic-based computerized system. One company has even developed a fuzzy logic 
technique for improving the swings of golf-crazy Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Many large Japanese electronics companies, including Hitachi, NEC Corp. and 
Toshiba Corp., are conducting research in fuzzy logic. It is also being studied 
in the Soviet Union, Europe and, especially, in China, which is said to have 
about 10,000 fuzzy logic researchers. But only a handful of companies in the 
United States are involved in fuzzy logic research, including, now, Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
"We've applied fuzzy logic for controlling a flexible aircraft wing," said 
Allen Firstenberg, director of information sciences at Rockwell's research 
center in Thousand Oaks. "There are lots of applications where you'd like to 
have improved control of the wings so you can fly faster. Fuzzy (logic) is an 
excellent controller in laboratory situations." 
</P>
<P>
Still, fuzzy logic has its skeptics in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's overrated," said Judea Pearl, a computer science professor at 
UCLA. "In applications such as medical diagnosis and prediction, it has failed 
miserably. . . . If a sprinkler is on, fuzzy logic will suggest it has rained, 
simply because the ground is wet. It has no context." 
</P>
<P>
Bart Kosko, an engineering professor at USC, says fuzzy logic's oddball name 
has given it a reputation akin to "a boy named Sue." But, he sees great promise 
for fuzziness, calling it "one of the fundamentally new mathematical concepts 
of the 2Oth Century." 
</P>
<P>
Togai's first major commercial project is a joint development program with 
Japan's Mitshubish Heavy Industries to develop the world's first 
air-conditioning system using fuzzy logic. The system is designed to function 
more like a human's sense of temperature, making adjustments based on more 
variables than just the temperature being more or less than a certain degree. 
</P>
<P>
Togai is working with a major Japanese electronics company, whose name it is 
won't disclose, to develop an automatic-focusing camera using fuzzy logic, said 
Perkins, the firm's vice president of business development. Another customer, 
which the Irvine firm also won't disclose, is a large U.S. aerospace company 
that is using fuzzy logic equipment to diagnosis mechanical problems in jet 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
Masaki Togai hopes that more U.S. companies will begin to see the benefits of 
fuzzy logic. He believes that Japanese firms are more willing to invest in 
fuzzy logic research because they generally take a longer-term view of business 
than their American rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese industry is very competitive and more likely to look at new 
technologies" even if the bottom-line return is years into the future, Togai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But USC's Kosko offers a cultural explanation for the resistance to fuzzy logic 
in the United States. Eastern culture is more rooted in religion and philosophy 
that stresses vagueness and uncertainty -- the essence of fuzzy logic theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the Buddhist and Taoist religions, "there is a simultaneous occurrence of 
something and its exact opposite," Kosko said. "This type of thought permeates 
Eastern belief. What you are seeing in fuzzy theory is the clash of Eastern and 
Western belief systems at the level of science."

ENVIRONMENT: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS PERCEIVED AS THE CHAMPION OF METHANOL. 
THE PROPANE INDUSTRY IS LAUNCHING AN ASSAULT AGAINST METHANOL AND FINDS ITSELF 
JOCKEYING FOR A FUELS NICHE ALONG WITH OTHERS IN WASHINGTON.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the morning rush of commuters, the white Ford Taurus blended well with the 
hundreds of other cars on Washington's traffic-clogged six-lane Beltway. 
</P>
<P>
But as the sedan passed an 18-wheeler at 60 miles an hour, the driver flicked a 
switch just below the dashboard and the Taurus became like no other car on the 
busy highway. 
</P>
<P>
It was now running on propane instead of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
As Congress moves toward enacting tougher laws to combat urban pollution and 
other environmental concerns, including global warming, the word is out: The 
1990s may well become the decade in which the alternative-fuel automobile with 
its fewer pollutants will challenge the conventional gasoline-powered car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phase-In by 1995 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has proposed legislation calling for a phase-in of thousands of 
alternative-fuel vehicles beginning in 1995 and for production of at least 1 
million such cars a year by 1997 in urban areas with the worst smog. 
</P>
<P>
William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, says there is no 
other way to attain a significant reduction in urban smog and still acknowledge 
Americans' love of their automobiles than to phase in large numbers of cars 
that use cleaner fuels than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there has been a rush to Washington by almost every conceivable 
maker and promoter of alternative fuels in an attempt to carve out a niche in 
that yet-to-be-defined future market of motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lots on Capital Hill were dotted one day recently with vehicles 
powered by various fuels from propane to hydrogen. 
</P>
<P>
Among then were: 
</P>
<P>
* A transit bus with a specially designed engine powered by natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
* A Mercedes-Benz sedan powered by an experimental solar-hydrogen system. 
</P>
<P>
* Vehicles from beer and pizza trucks to mid-size sedans all fueled by propane. 
</P>
<P>
The propane-powered sedans -- including the white Taurus -- were equipped with 
duel-fuel systems that allowed with a touch of a switch to shift from unleaded 
gasoline to propane, even at highway speeds, with hardly a notice. 
</P>
<P>
But the alternative fuel most talked about for passenger cars -- and cited 
specifically by Bush -- is methanol, a liquid that comes from methane, the main 
component of natural gas. Methanol is in large supply, requires no 
pressurization and could be dispensed from service station pumps alongside 
those offering gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol has been so widely discussed that producers of other alternative fuels 
have sent their representatives to Capitol Hill to complain that it is the only 
substitute fuel the EPA and the White House are interested in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bias' Toward Methanol 
</P>
<P>
"What we're striving for with the EPA and the legislative (lobbying) is a level 
playing field," said Bob Meyers, executive vice president for marketing at 
Petrolane Inc., the country's largest retailer of propane. He said there is 
clear evidence of a "bias" toward methanol in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Top EPA officials do tilt toward methanol and White House counsel C. Boyden 
Gray has made no secret of his views on the fuel. He has been driving a 
Chevrolet Citation that runs on alcohol for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people have portrayed the Administration as being dominated by methanol 
junkies," Patrick Quinn, the EPA's director of congressional liaison, told a 
propane industry group, insisting that such a characterization is not true. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Quinn acknowledged that methanol appears to be a "fuel of 
choice" as an alternative to gasoline for most passenger cars. But he said the 
agency plans to establish pollution standards for other fuels as well and 
envisions both propane and compressed natural gas as eventually gaining 
significant niches, especially in such areas as fleet vehicles and transit 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Numbers 
</P>
<P>
There already are an estimated 350,000 propane-powered vehicles in use 
nationwide, almost exclusively in fleet operations. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are more than 250 taxis in Las Vegas, 160 school buses in Kansas 
City, Kan., sheriff's department cars in Sarasota, Fla., and a variety of 
delivery trucks. Propane has been used in farm vehicles for years. 
</P>
<P>
But propane still is primarily used for heating, with only about 3% of sales 
going to vehicles. "What we see now is a golden opportunity (for expansion). 
The niche we see is really in the fleet industry," says Jerry Schmitt, a 
marketing consultant for Ferrellgas, a major propane retailer. 
</P>
<P>
But all this talk of substitute fuels for gasoline has not escaped notice of 
the petroleum industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Gasolines 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. recently announced it would begin offering a 
reformulated, cleaner-burning leaded gasoline for older cars. Other oil 
companies reportedly are developing cleaner-burning unleaded gasoline and plan 
soon to put them in test markets in light of the expected tighter air pollution 
standards being debated in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the oil industry has unleashed a public relations assault on 
methanol, including newspaper ads saying that it is highly toxic and even small 
amounts could be fatal if swallowed; that it releases formaldehyde, an 
ozone-causing and probably carcinogenic pollutant; and that it would likely be 
more expensive than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA responded with a report on methanol saying that the fuel remains a 
sound alternative, that its expected price will be competitive with gasoline 
and that its safety risks are no greater than with other fuels, including 
gasoline.

CHASE SAYS $1.1-BILLION LOSS CAUSED BY BOOSTING RESERVES

<P>
Chase Manhattan Corp., the second-largest U.S. banking company, kicked off the 
third-quarter earnings reporting period Wednesday by disclosing a $1.1-billion 
loss, owing to a huge charge for boosting its Third World loan-loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
However, excluding the special provision, Chase's earnings were strong, fueled 
by loan growth and trading income, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was attributed to $1.26 billion in after-tax charges for the increased 
loan-loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Without special items and reserve boosts, Chase's third-quarter 1989 income 
rose to $151 million, up from $130 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter operating profits, Chase said, were helped by increases in 
net interest income, consumer and investment banking fees and trading account 
income. Foreign exchange trading income was lower, and expenses were higher. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 third quarter it earned $283 million, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
"Setting aside provisions, the quarter was confirmation of the high quality of 
Chase's core earnings," said Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.'s James McDermott. 
"Net interest income was up and the trading account was up nicely." 
</P>
<P>
The banking company also took a $126 million pretax charge for Arizona real 
estate assets, and a $38 million pretax charge to restructure its securities 
trading business.

The central Kentucky farm of Bobby and Judy Lutz is truly a family business. 
The Lutzes' three children help to care for and milk the Holstein herd, which 
is a family in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
About three of every four cows they milk is a daughter or granddaughter of 
Mitzi or Alice, two registered Holsteins the Lutzes bought more than 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In just one decade the Lutzes have built a superior herd of about 200 purebred 
Holsteins, something that once took a farmer's lifetime. Embryo transfers -- 
implanting fertilized eggs from Mitzi or Alice into surrogates -- has made it 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Lutz says a cow normally will have about four offspring in a lifetime. 
Mitzi and Alice each have produced several dozen. He says all of their female 
offspring, born to surrogate mothers, have become super milk cows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investment Paid Off 
</P>
<P>
Embryo transfer, commonly called ET, began in the mid-1970s. Lutz says he and 
his wife invested $30,000 in start-up costs in 1980, when ETs were financially 
risky and the couple was struggling to pay off their 230-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
The investment paid off. 
</P>
<P>
The Lutzes last year earned more than $50,000 -- about 25% of their farm income 
-- from the sale of frozen embryos and live bulls from embryo transfers. 
</P>
<P>
The family sells embryos for $800 to $1,500 per egg, depending upon pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreigners prefer the embryos because the risk of importing a disease is less 
and it's less expensive than sending a bull or a breeding female," Lutz says. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnancy rates of the surrogates range from about 65% to 80%, about the same 
or better than natural breeding, according to farmers and veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
The process used to be more costly because implants were done surgically. Now 
they're generally done with a plunger-type device, and unregistered commercial 
animals are usually the surrogates. This allows the farmer to continue using 
the superior cow as an egg producer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Eggs Frozen 
</P>
<P>
Some eggs are frozen in liquid nitrogen so they can be used or sold later. 
</P>
<P>
Fees for embryo transplants vary, but the costs generally are about what the 
Lutzes pay Cheryl and Larry Nelson, owners of Nelson Reproductive Services. 
</P>
<P>
The Nelsons charge $200 to flush embryos from an egg-producing cow with a 
saline solution, about one week after the eggs are fertilized through 
artificial insemination. It costs the Lutzes $100 per cow for implants and $50 
for each egg that is frozen for export. 
</P>
<P>
Injections of hormones beforehand, to prompt an abundance of eggs, aren't 
harmful to the cows and don't present a health risk to people who drink their 
milk, according to George Hershey, a University of Kentucky dairy specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The protein hormones aren't like steroids and seem to break down in cows' 
bodies, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Lutz says the biggest drawback to ET is the record keeping. He says it takes 
hours of detailed paper work to track the bloodlines of his herd and embryos. 
</P>
<P>
Embryo transfers may not be for every farmer. 
</P>
<P>
Panayiotis Zavos, University of Kentucky reproductive physiologist, says 
farmers who don't own a registered herd may not find the process 
cost-effective. He says those who are interested in the technology should 
consult an expert with a successful track record. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let just anyone in to monkey with your cows," Zavos says.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geneva Brown's house would look right at home in Big Sur. Its cedar siding 
would slip seamlessly into the greenery of the Vermont mountains, and its large 
windows would let in the crystalline light and turquoise skies of the American 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Geneva Brown's house is in Essex, Md., in a working-class 
neighborhood of small, ranch-style houses. But it fits right in there too. At 
the end of her road sits a patch of woods, and the house, a two-story, 14-sided 
"round house" with decks both upstairs and down, makes the best possible use of 
its small plot of suburban forest. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has been a lifelong home to Brown, a psychiatric nurse. She 
was raised in Essex, and when she inherited her one-third acre wooded plot from 
her mother, who owned several parcels of land in the area, she knew she wanted 
to build a house there. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want a traditional home," says the divorced mother of four, who only 
a couple of years ago was living in a townhouse development. Her custom-built 
house had to be a design she loved, but it also had to be a house for which 
she, who describes herself as an "age 51, black, single, registered nurse not 
making a fortune," could obtain financing. 
</P>
<P>
She found her dream in an advertisement in a newspaper. Eagle's Nest Homes, 
based in Canton, Ga., offered California-style cedar houses with spiral 
staircases, high "pagoda" ceilings, wraparound decks and computerized security 
systems. But the company also promised affordability, energy-efficiency and 
design flexibility. Brown was so taken by the concept that she visited the 
Georgia headquarters, and not only put down a deposit on the house, but signed 
on as a Baltimore-area Eagle's Nest franchisee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty good with people," explains Brown, who has sales experience as a 
wholesale distributor for a variety of products. She told the Eagle's Nest 
executives that she would soon appear on Fortune's list of new American 
millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle's Nest occupies a growing middle ground between the development house and 
the architect-designed luxury custom job. Occupying this territory are 
companies that provide "pre-engineered" houses, with components that can be put 
together in a variety of ways, to appeal to independent-minded consumers. Among 
the better known of these companies are Yankee Barn, whose open-plan houses 
resemble the company's namesakes; Timberpeg, which provides materials and plans 
for old-fashioned post-and-beam houses; and a number of log house 
manufacturers. Related to these, but usually more traditional in style, are 
modular houses, which are put together in a factory and then transported to the 
buyer's building site. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle's Nest "open-faced panelized" house kits include exterior wood wall 
panels and woodwork, thermal pane windows and insulated doors (which are 
mounted in the panels), roofing materials, decks, and, if desired, fireplaces. 
Systems (except for the computer) and interiors are not included, but must be 
installed by a local contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"You can do anything you want to with the inside," says Jay Arkuszeski, whose 
company Aries Builders was hired to build Brown's house. "On the first floor, 
the only thing in the entire interior of the building is one steel post in the 
center. On the second floor there is nothing, because the roof is 
self-supporting, so even the interior walls are done locally." 
</P>
<P>
While Brown's house is a single unit, Eagle's Nest kits can be combined for 
unusual architectural effects, or the houses expanded with the addition of 
"cluster units," linked to the main building by bridges or atriums. A number of 
units can be put together to form office blocks, condominiums or dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
For her own 2,100-square-foot, single-unit home, Brown opted for a simple open 
plan, with the living-dining room, master bedroom, and an open kitchen with an 
L-shaped dining island on the second floor. Downstairs is the family room, 
which is used mostly for parties and as a playroom for Brown's seven 
grandchildren, and two bedrooms, one of which belongs to one of her sons. Both 
her bedroom and her son's open out onto decks that face the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury touches abound, including a pedestal whirlpool bathtub and an elaborate 
computer system. As the computer system provided by Eagle's Nest was fairly 
simple, Brown had it beefed up with a more extensive system from Intellitech in 
Owings Mills, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"This one does everything but cook for you," says Brown, who predicts that all 
new houses will be "smart" houses within a few years. "It's really another 
friend. It's actually better than a friend. I don't have to give it anything, 
but it gives me everything!" 
</P>
<P>
The system is programmed to tell her if a door or window is open or has been 
broken; and will inform intruders (and police) that they have entered a secured 
area. Instead of a key, the door is opened with a prearranged code, which can 
be changed at the whim of the homeowner. The computer turns on lights and 
appliances at Brown's signal, and has even been programmed with her favorite 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with getting the house built was arranging the mortgage. 
Although Eagle's Nest houses have been approved for FHA and VA financing, some 
banks are still leery of such an experimental style of housing. However, Brown 
reports, such resistance is fading. 
</P>
<P>
As for Arkuszeski, he says his toughest job was getting the panels and other 
materials out of the tractor trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't waste any space. It's really wedged in there," he says with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company literature touts the affordability of Eagle's Nest houses 
("Here is a custom built home almost everyone can afford. . . . You no longer 
have to wait for your ship to come in to live in the home of your dreams. . . 
."), there are a number of variables that affect the total cost, including land 
costs, contractor's fees, and the elaborateness of the interiors (The basic 
kits range in price from $21,000 to $25,000). 
</P>
<P>
"She ended up paying $48-a-square-foot (for the completed house), which at the 
time was anything from $2 to $7 less a square foot than anything else custom 
built," Arkuszeski says. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to hear anybody say they can't afford one of these homes, because 
they can," Brown exclaims. "If I can do it on a nurse's pay, they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Her home does have a decidedly upscale look, (a fact that, she says, has 
irritated neighbors who fear that property tax assessments on their homes will 
increase), and she has decorated to emphasize the luxe look. 
</P>
<P>
Even if she does not join that Fortune list any time soon, Brown thinks her 
house, which she moved into a year ago, one of the most exciting things that's 
ever happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come home feeling stressed, I sit out here and have a cup of coffee, 
and look out at the greenery, and know things are going to be all right," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
She has other dreams for the house: She wants to install a serene "prayer 
garden," with a small altar, in the woods. And someday she hopes to build a 
pool next to her lower deck. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a showplace," she says. "The great thing is, it's like 
being a millionaire, even if you're poor. That's it, I'm a poor millionaire!"

LONDON BAROQUE IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chamber Music in Historic Sites matched genuine Baroque musical style with a 
campy, mock-Baroque interior for the opening of the Nakamichi Brillante series 
Monday evening. The site: the Second City Theater (ex Mayfair) in Santa Monica. 
The players: London Baroque, an 11-year-old ensemble featuring some recent 
personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
The exuberant performances fit the gaudy showcase -- its hospitable acoustic 
compromised by an insistent buzz from the ceiling lights -- with an informal, 
almost improvised feeling. The sense of convivial camaraderie -- and the length 
of the concert -- were extended in a gracious and game but misplaced effort to 
serve everyone coffee and dessert during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
The musical goodies were presented with thorough respect, understanding and 
affection for period practices -- original instruments, very low pitch, 
ornamental elan, etc. Such attention to detail is no rarity these days for 
historically oriented groups, but the bracing vitality, conversational approach 
and sheer recreative joy of the playing is. 
</P>
<P>
Violinists Hiro Kurosaki and Richard Gwilt, cellist Charles Medlam and 
harpsichordist Lars Mortensen played trio sonatas by Corelli, Handel and Bach 
as if the music had just been composed. Ideas were discovered and exchanged 
seemingly spontaneously, in elastic tempos and pertinent phrasing. Balances and 
textures were clear, and technique secure. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosaki, a flamboyant fiddler and one of the newer members of the group, had 
the engaging solo duties in an animal sound extravaganza by Biber, the Sonata 
Representativa Avium. Mortensen, also new, gave an almost indolent, then 
explosively speedy account of Bach's Prelude, Fugue and Allegro, while ensemble 
leader Medlam proved eloquent although occasionally technically troubled in a 
sonata by Vivaldi. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosaki and Gwilt completed the printed program with the dazzling interplay of 
an unaccompanied duet by Leclair. For their encore, the quartet turned to what 
Medlam characterized as modern music -- a Church Sonata in D by Mozart. JOHN 
HENKEN

JAZZ NOTES : PAOLO NONNIS TO LEAD BUDDY RICH BIG BAND; CONCERT WILL AID VICTIMS 
OF HURRICANE HUGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paolo Nonnis, a relatively unknown Los Angeles-based drummer who has led his 
own big band for several years, has been selected to front the reorganized 
Buddy Rich Big Band. 
</P>
<P>
Nonnis will lead a band with some Rich alumni, including saxophonist Steve 
Marcus, in engagements at At My Place in Santa Monica on Monday and Tuesday. 
The Rich band has not been active since the great drummer died in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Paolo led a band playing some of Buddy's charts and with some of Buddy's 
players at jazz festivals in Italy this summer," said Tony Oppedisano, Nonnis' 
manager, in explaining the surprising choice. "When he got back home, he and I 
sent a tape of that band to Cathy Rich, Buddy's daughter, and she flipped over 
it. She felt that it was time to have the band back, and that the best way to 
keep her father's name alive was to keep his music alive." 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is really exciting," said Nonnis, who has lived in Los Angeles 
for 10 years and has also backed trombonist Dick Shearer's band. "Buddy didn't 
work all his life to have his music disappear. This music is really going to be 
fun to play." 
</P>
<P>
Plans are for Cathy Rich to help book the band, Oppedisano to manage it and 
Nonnis to lead it. The drummer said there will be East and West Coast versions 
and that they will feature Rich alumni as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Nonnis will be in attendance, but will not play, at the first Los Angeles Buddy 
Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert, set for the Wiltern Theatre Saturday at 7 
p.m. That night, the Buddy Rich Big Band will be backed by such drummers as 
Louie Bellson, Steve Gadd, Vinnie Colaiuta, Gregg Bissonette, Dennis Chambers 
and Dave Weckl. Comedian Jeff Altman and Rich will be the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the event will go to a scholarship for drummers who are 
eligible for college in fall, 1990. Five finalists have been selected from 
those who applied for the award through Modern Drummer magazine, and the winner 
will be announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Information: At My Place: (213) 451-8596; Wiltern: (213) 480-3232. 
</P>
<P>
To aid victims of Hurricane Hugo, the Biltmore Hotel, the American Red Cross 
and the radio program Alma del Barrio (heard weekends on KXLU-FM) are 
presenting a Latin/jazz concert at the Biltmore Bowl downtown on Tuesday at 8

Singer Anita O'Day achieves septuagenarian status next Wednesday, and thought 
that was as good a reason as any for a bash. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure if you live to be 70 with the way I've lived, you might as well throw 
a birthday party," said O'Day, who is making a one-nighter at the Vine Street 
Bar &amp; Grill Tuesday at 9. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, we can sing 'Happy Birthday' to me at midnight," quipped the singer, 
whose latest release is "In a Mellow Tone" (DRG). 
</P>
<P>
O'Day, who will be backed by pianist Pete Jolly's trio plus saxman Gordon 
Brisker, said show business is still her business. "You can't beat it," she 
said. "It's even getting better." 
</P>
<P>
The singer returns to Vine Street for a regular engagement Nov. 2-5. 
Information: (213) 463-4375.

With sounds provided by the Manhattan Transfer, the Hi-Los and the New American 
Orchestra, about 400 music lovers attended the Foundation for New American 
Music's 11th annual Musicale, last Saturday afternoon at Hugh and Kimberley 
Hefner's Playboy mansion in Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation's president, Jack Elliott, the event, a fund-raiser 
at which Carl Reiner was the chipper emcee, brought in approximately $100,000. 
"I'm delighted," he said. "Now I don't have to beg for money until February." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra will make three appearances at UCLA's Royce Hall this season, 
beginning in December. Plans are also in the works to have the ensemble, which 
blends elements of jazz, classical and popular musics in its offerings, to 
record an LP for MCA Jazz Records. 
</P>
<P>
If you missed pianist Michel Petrucciani in town last week, you can catch up 
with him on fellow pianist Marian McPartland's "Piano Jazz" radio program 
Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KPCC (89.3 FM). Petrucciani offers his composition, "The 
Prayer," and joins McPartland for a rendition of John Coltrane's "Giant Steps." 
Other McPartland guests this month on this "Best Of" series include two late 
pianist geniuses: Phineas Newborn, Oct. 24, and Mary Lou Williams, Oct. 31.

JOB BRINGS OUT THEIR FRIGHTENING PERSONAS

BUENA PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most people, the perfect vacation would be two weeks in the Caribbean or 10 
days at a Colorado ski resort. But for Bob Penske, the ideal escape is a 
$4.42-per-hour job for which he dresses as the Hunchback of Ghost Town and 
scares the daylights out of people at Knott's Berry Farm's Halloween Haunt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun. This is my vacation," Penske said Friday at the park's first Monster 
College, a two-hour crash course designed to train hired extras in the fine art 
of fright-making. 
</P>
<P>
"How many people actually get a chance to put on a different face and pretend 
to be someone else?" asked the 32-year-old business executive from Riverside 
County, a veteran of six Knott's Halloween Haunts. "It's like being a kid 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Penske is typical of many of the hired ghouls who haunt the rides and back 
streets of Knott's every year -- not for the money, but for the chance to 
really scare people and feel good about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved the rush you get from being scared. I want to pass that rush 
on to others," said 19-year-old Robby Robertson, a first-time ghoul who will be 
haunting the park's "Baits Motel," Friday through Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the Haunt offers a chance to let their hair down -- to really cut 
loose without the fear of becoming a public spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
"Halloween is the time I can let go and have fun," said Cynthia Dewell, 18, of 
Buena Park. "As a waitress I normally have to be cool and collected. At the 
Haunt I can really let my frustrations out." 
</P>
<P>
For others, being a monster is a way to unleash the wilder side of their 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"As a normal person, I would never jump out at people. But when I put on the 
mask I go out there and go crazy," said Craig Hareld, a seven-year veteran of 
the Haunt who plays the Cat Man in Ghost Town. 
</P>
<P>
For Don Ballwey, a 29-year-old art major at Cal State Fullerton, it's the 
camaraderie he shares with his fellow goblins that has led him to reprise his 
role as Dracula for the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun," he says. "I just keep coming back for the people. It's 
like a family reunion." 
</P>
<P>
Still, being a zombie or a werewolf can have its downside. 
</P>
<P>
"The guests can be monsters themselves," complains Penske. "A lot of times 
these 11-year-old boys will slug you or spit on you. You really have to know 
how to interpret the crowd and be able to tolerate abuse from the guests. 
That's the mark of a good street character." 
</P>
<P>
John Kennedy, a registered nurse from Burbank who claims to hold the record 
(eight years) for longevity as a Knott's ghoul, agrees with Penske. 
</P>
<P>
"The teen-age boys are the ones to watch out for, they can be a bit 
rambunctious. But you just have to go into it with the attitude of having fun 
and being careful. Even with its bad moments I'd be willing to do it for 
nothing. It's that much fun."

EARTHQUAKE WHAT-TO-DOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If an earthquake strikes and you are . . . 
</P>
<P>
In your home: Do not run outside (most earthquake-related injuries happen 
outdoors). Get away from windows, mirrors and light fixtures. Watch out for 
tall bookcases or china cases that might topple. Climb under a table or desk or 
stand in a doorway if possible. If this isn't possible, crouch against a solid 
wall. Get into a duck-and-cover position, using sofa cushions or pillows to 
protect your head. 
</P>
<P>
In a car: Pull to the side of the road (if possible) and stop the car. Do not 
attempt to continue driving. Do not park under trees, light posts or signs. Do 
not park on or under a bridge. Stay inside your car and get down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In an office: Get under your desk or in a doorway if possible. If not, crouch 
against a solid wall and protect your head with what is available, such as a 
book, notebook, large handbag, suit coat or briefcase. Many offices have fake 
drop-ceiling tiles that are easily shaken loose by quakes, so protecting your 
head with something is a must. 
</P>
<P>
In a mall/store: Get away from glass store fronts. Do not head for the exits, 
most of which are glass. Crouch against a solid wall. If you have children, put 
them against the wall and drape yourself over them in a crouching position. 
Make as small a target as possible. Do not attempt to use escalators or 
elevators. 
</P>
<P>
In an elevator: Most elevators will automatically stop moving when the shaking 
starts. When the quake stops, stomp on the floor in an attempt to get someone 
to hear you. If possible, escape through the trapdoor at the top of the 
elevator, since there is a danger of fire. 
</P>
<P>
In a restaurant: The safest place is under the table, since table-tops are made 
of sturdy material. Do not attempt to run across the restaurant if you are at a 
table or booth near the windows -- climb under the table and protect your head. 
Many restaurants have objects on the walls that could fly across the room, so 
climbing under your own table is the best bet. 
</P>
<P>
In a high-rise building: Climb under a desk or stand in a doorway. Stay clear 
of windows, shelves, cabinets and glass partitions. Most high-rises are built 
so they will sway with a quake more than you would think, but it is actually a 
protection to keep them from toppling. Do not run for the exit because the 
stairways may be broken and/or jammed with people. Do not attempt to use the 
elevator since the power may have failed. 
</P>
<P>
In a parking garage: Do not run. Crouch against a pillar or solid wall, 
covering your head with your purse, jacket or shopping bags. If in your car, do 
not attempt to drive. Stay in the car and get down on the floor.

THE SAN ANDREAS CAUSES MANY TO QUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
BUT THE NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FAULT MAY EVENTUALLY PACK THE BIGGER WALLOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Andreas is the glamour fault, the crease in California's surface that 
grabs the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the lesser-known Newport-Inglewood Fault, which runs through the 
heart of coastal Orange County, Long Beach and West Los Angeles, that 
scientists say may deliver the really Big One. 
</P>
<P>
Geologically, the two faults are cousins. They are classic strike-slip faults, 
meaning that when an earthquake occurs the earth on either side of the fault 
line shifts horizontally, rather than vertically in the case of a "thrust" 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas is the granddaddy of strike-slip faults. It forms the boundary 
between two massive "plates" or sections of the earth's crust that are moving 
in opposite directions. When the plates along the San Andreas move far enough, 
a quake may occur to relieve tension on the fault. 
</P>
<P>
Geologists expect a major earthquake -- perhaps one as strong as 8.5 on the 
Richter scale -- along the San Andreas' southern section within the next 50 
years. Such a quake could kill thousands of people and cause billions of 
dollars in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
But a sizably smaller temblor on the Newport-Inglewood fault could produce the 
same catastrophic results. The reason is location. The San Andreas skirts the 
most densely populated portions of the Southern California basin, running 
roughly north-south from the Salton Sea along the backside of the San Gabriel 
Mountains across the San Joaquin Valley to San Francisco Bay. It is the master 
fault of a vast fault system that runs nearly the length of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport-Inglewood fault is a runt, by San Andreas standards. It has neither 
the length of the San Andreas nor the standing in quake lore. But its potential 
for destruction should it shake or shift is unarguable, experts say. The fault 
encompasses some of the most intensely developed neighborhoods and commercial 
centers in Orange and Los Angeles counties, running from Newport Beach to Long 
Beach and north to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A magnitude 7.3 quake on the fault could cause $60 billion in property damage. 
Nearly 5,000 people could die. 
</P>
<P>
"A smaller earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood could cause an equal amount of 
damage of a bigger quake on the San Andreas," Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is the geological makeup of Southern California. Most of the soil in 
the basin, including Orange County, is a relatively loose sediment from river 
and storm runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"The L.A. Basin is like a big hole filled with Jell-O," said Hutton, adding 
that there is very little bedrock or solid material to "absorb the shaking." 
Thus, a quake on the Newport-Inglewood tends to feel more powerful than its 
actual magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, for example, a moderate 4.6 magnitude quake centered on the fault 
under Newport Beach violently shook wide areas of the county. It frightened 
even seasoned Southern Californians because of the severity of the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas, on the other hand, is buried in more solid ground, geologists 
say. Therefore, it will take a more powerful quake to generate the same 
vibration of a smaller temblor on the Newport-Inglewood fault. 
</P>
<P>
But Hutton said the San Andreas deservedly gets more attention because 
scientists believe it has a shorter "recurrence time" between major quakes. 
Earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or greater are likely to occur every 250 
years or sooner along the San Andreas, while such temblors on the 
Newport-Inglewood are more likely every 1,500 years. The last major episode on 
the Newport-Inglewood fault was the 6.3 Long Beach quake in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are estimates," Hutton said. "And estimates are just that. A quake could 
happen anytime -- tomorrow, next week or 50 years from now. We don't make 
predictions because we just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas is a more closely studied fault, Hutton said. In Central 
California near Parkfield, there are more than 100 different creep meters, 
seismographs, strain tests and other experiments under way to monitor the 
fault's movement. That stretch of the San Andreas has been pegged by scientists 
as the most likely for a quake of 5.0 or greater. 
</P>
<P>
Similar scrutiny of the Newport-Inglewood fault, however, is impossible, Hutton 
says. Because nearly all of the fault zone is developed -- and privately held 
-- Hutton said, it is difficult to find a safe and suitable location to set up 
test equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to monitor such a fault because of the traffic noise and issues of 
access and vandalism," Hutton said. "We're left to draw conclusions about the 
fault's behavior from past experience."

HOW TO PURIFY WATER

<TEXT>
<P>
If water is polluted (cloudy or you have reason to believe it has been 
contaminated in some fashion even though it looks clean), strain it through 
paper towels, coffee filters or several layers of clean cloth. This will remove 
sediment and anything floating. Bring the water to a boil (it will bubble 
vigorously) and let it remain so for five minutes (or longer if you have the 
heat to spare). 
</P>
<P>
If you have no heat source, strain the water as explained above and then add 
liquid chlorine household bleach or tincture of iodine (do not use granulated 
forms of bleach as they may be poisonous). Stir or shake well and let it stand 
30 minutes before using. 
</P>
<P>
Buy an eyedropper to make this easier and use it for this purpose only. Here 
are the formulas:

Mention earthquakes and Orange County residents look to the notorious San 
Andreas Fault, 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Yet 
experts say a greater danger lies underfoot the Newport-Inglewood Fault slicing 
north along the Orange County coast from Newport Beach. It has already provided 
the worst urban quake in Southern California history -- the 1933 Long Beach 
Earthquake that killed 120 people and caused $40 million damage. Yet that 
6.3-magnitude jolt was not the worst this fault can deliver. Geologists believe 
a quake of at least magnitude 7 is possible -- and that would cause more death 
and destruction than an even greater quake along the San Andreas. Based on 
interviews with experts and a scenario recently published by the state, here is 
what Orange County would be like if a 7.3-magnitude quake struck at 7:41 on a 
typical Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
* A major water line snaps near Fullerton Creek in Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
* El Toro Marine Corps Air Station closes for 6 hours, but an inspection of 
runways finds no serious damage because the facility is inland and not subject 
to significant ground settlement 
</P>
<P>
* John Wayne Airport sustains damage to the runway, fuel tanks and other 
structures. Closed for 24 hours, it reopens after repairs are made at the 
northeast end of its runway. But surrounding freeway damage makes it difficult 
to passengers to reach the terminal 
</P>
<P>
* Sewage plant in Fountain Valley, one of two serving 80% of the county's 
2.1-million residents is severely damaged and likely to remain that way for 
weeks or months. Raw sewage overflows into streets and the ocean 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center -- an emergency earthquake 
operations post -- sustains significant damage to runways, fuel tanks and 
structures. Closed for 24 hours, it reopens for landings of C-130 cargo planes 
bearing relief supplies 
</P>
<P>
* Alamitos power plant is shut down for more than 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Haynes power plant is shut down for more than 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* A major natural gas line to the Huntington Beach power plant ruptures east of 
Bolsa Chica Beach State Park 
</P>
<P>
* Huntington Beach power plant is shut down for more than 3 days 
</P>
<P>
* Sewage plant in Huntington Beach, one of two serving 80% of the county's 
2.1-million residents is severely damaged and likely to remain that way for 
weeks or months. Raw sewage overflows into streets and the ocean 
</P>
<P>
* San Onofre nuclear power plant, 5 miles south of San Clemente, is undamaged 
</P>
<P>
* Storage tanks in Seal Beach are damaged and spill fuel into Alamitos Bay 
</P>
<P>
* Water Supply 
</P>
<P>
Water lines and pumping stations near the fault are damaged, forcing coastal 
cities to rely on local storage facilities and tank trucks for drinking water

'Strike-slip' Fault 
</P>
<P>
* Earthquakes along the Newport-Inglewood and San Andreas fault occur when 
earth on either side of the fault line lurches horizontally in opposite 
directions. In contrast to the "strike-slip" fault, a "thrust" fault -- such as 
the one that caused the 1971 Sylmar-San Fernando quake -- has one sides that 
moves vertically up or down against the other 
</P>
<P>
Richter Scale 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, former Caltech professor Charles F. Richter devised a logarithmic 
scale that grades the severity of earthquakes. Each whole number on the scale 
indicates a quake that is 10-times greater than the number before. A magnitude 
of 5.0, for example, would be 10-times a 4.0, but 100-times a 3.0. The atomic 
bomb dropped on Hiroshima -- about 20,000 tons of TNT -- would amount to a 6.3 
earthquake. So the 7.3-magnitude quake in the Newport-Inglewood scenario would 
exert 10-times the force

ASK THE VET: SMALL OUTDOOR SHELTER KEEPS TABBY PROTECTED

Q: Is it true that one dog year is equal to seven human years? I see this fact 
on commercials and everyone seems to mention it when they talk about how old 
their dogs are. How do you determine such a ratio? 
</P>
<P>
Paul Munoz, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
A: The seven-to-one rule is probably a rough average estimate, not meant to be 
an accurate gauge for comparing human years to dog years. 
</P>
<P>
On the average, a dog reaches sexual and growth maturity within six to nine 
months, which would be roughly equivalent to a 15- to 18-year-old human. A 
dog's "adult" life span is generally uniform for about six to eight years. Then 
they start to show definite signs of aging. Many dogs will age very rapidly, 
changing hair coat color and losing weight. These changes occur more rapidly 
than in a human. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-to-one ratio is probably based on the average life span of a human 
being, which is in the 70s to early 80s, while a dog's average life span is 10 
to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What would cause my cat to have a drastic bowel movement change? He is about 
4 years old and is a Himalayan (not purebred). He had an eye infection about a 
month ago. I took him to our vet, he was treated with antibiotics and seemed to 
be doing well. However, he didn't eat for a week, drank a lot of water and had 
diarrhea during that week. He underwent X-rays to find out if there was 
anything unusual going on in his stomach. Everything was negative. 
</P>
<P>
He was given a vitamin shot and started eating again. He seems to be in good 
health. He is playful and happy again, but he still has diarrhea. I've asked my 
vet about it, but he's not very explicit and seems to think it will just go 
away. This condition has been going on for two weeks now and I'm very worried. 
I don't want to be an alarmist, but I feel this might lead to something 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
I love my cat. He is all I have left after I lost my husband four months ago. 
I'm 70 years old, and I couldn't stand another loss. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jessie Gonzalez, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
A: Diarrhea in cats is a very common condition with a wide variety of causes. 
Changes in diet, scrounging in trash cans, eating mice or birds, intestinal 
parasites, stress, bacteria and viruses can all be listed as causes of 
diarrhea. The difficult part is trying to identify the cause and getting your 
pet treated. Ideally, multiple fecal samples should be examined for parasites 
or their eggs. You should supply your vet with a fresh sample to be submitted 
to the lab, or your vet may want to hospitalize your cat to obtain multiple 
samples. Occasionally, fecal cultures may be of some benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Strict diet control and symptomatic treatment with anti-diarrheal medications 
and antibiotics may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, no cause is ever found, and often long-term medication is the 
only treatment. Most cats seem to respond to diet restrictions and medications. 
Your cat may even be sensitive to the antibiotics that were given for his eye 
infection and could return to normal with a change in medication.

JOSEPH N. BELL: ISSUES THAT RAISE THE HACKLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outrage time again. It has been building for a long time, but a recent front 
page in The Times broke it loose. Side-by-side stories: a Santa Ana police 
officer shoots a running man in the back while the victim's wife and children 
watch on a residential street; Costa Mesa police officers dress up like 
contractors, then arrest a group of men who seek work from them. A picture, 
also on the front page, shows these men handcuffed, clear dangers to society 
because they had the effrontery to look for honest work. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, I wrote a piece questioning the judgment involved in a 
police shooting in a crowded parking lot in South Coast Plaza. I quoted Capt. 
Tom Lazar of the Costa Mesa Police Department as saying: "Our officers are 
taught to use firearms only when their lives or the lives of other people are 
in danger. . . . But you've got to remember, they have to make that judgment 
within seconds. . . . What it finally boils down to is the judgment of the 
individual officer." 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of that column, The Times received a lengthy letter from Dr. 
Robert Sonntag, a Corona del Mar internist. Dr. Sonntag wrote, in part: "If a 
policeman is not willing to risk his own life to avoid injury to others 
(whether suspect or bystander), then he does not belong on the force. . . . As 
a physician, I have frequently placed my own life on the line for patients with 
life-threatening, communicable disease. I would have it no other way. I have 
lost one lung, surgically removed, the result of a practice-acquired infection. 
To use police logic, I should shoot down every infected patient who might pose 
a risk. 
</P>
<P>
"The most chilling fact of all is this: The police, once they draw their guns, 
are trained always to kill . . . never to give a warning shot. Never to wound, 
never to shoot in the leg or the arm. Naturally, that is the safest action for 
an officer, but that must never be our concern. This is the attitude of a 
police who have declared war against the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart of this tragedy is an indifferent and uninformed citizenry and 
legislature. So inured are we to the daily disclosures of police atrocities 
that we take them for granted as a 'necessary' ingredient of contemporary life. 
. . . Given the choice of confronting a cop with a gun or armed robbers, I 
would take my chances with the latter any day." 
</P>
<P>
If an Establishment physician feels this way, how must the little people -- the 
minorities without status or clout in this ultraconservative, law-and-order 
county -- feel? The man who ran from the Santa Ana officer two weeks ago was a 
petty thief, frightened out of his wits. He paid for that with his life. So did 
a young man in Anaheim earlier this week when he was killed by police, 
allegedly after grappling for a gun as he was trying to climb a fence to escape 
from the site of a drug stakeout. 
</P>
<P>
I once asked a former Newport Beach police chief how many of the people stopped 
by his officers were actually criminals, posing some danger to society. He 
estimated about 1%. When I asked him why the other 99% are also treated like 
criminals -- I had just experienced this after a routine traffic stop and it 
happened repeatedly to my students at UC Irvine -- he said that the police have 
no way of knowing which group a subject falls into. If he was serious -- and I 
think he was -- then Dr. Sonntag is justified in his fears and police 
professionalism is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa "contractor" police scam was, of course, the byproduct of 
municipal policies that seem to achieve new lows in wrongheadedness each week. 
A court will decide whether or not this was entrapment, but if it wasn't, that 
term should be removed from the book. If nothing else, I hope this incident 
will shut down some of those people who complain endlessly that all indigents 
are lazy, good-for-nothing bums who spend their lives on the public dole 
avoiding work. Many of the same people who mouth such cliches support a local 
policy that punishes those same indigents when they try desperately to find 
work. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one could assume that the major problems with which we are dealing 
in this country today are homosexuality, government support of the arts and the 
passage of a constitutional amendment to protect the flag, according to news 
inspired by several county congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Then we have Orange County Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) -- who usually takes a 
back seat to his noisier colleagues -- throwing a bash in Virginia for Oliver 
North, explaining that "he didn't keep all the rules, but the intent was there. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
What North did, of course, was break the law, frequently and with impunity. 
Packard went on to say that he believes Orange County has a particular affinity 
with North and his cause. I would like to opt out of that group, and I suspect 
there are a million or so other Orange Countians who would like to join me. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, another newspaper juxtaposition that sends a very clear message 
about priorities in this wealthy county in which we live. A large picture on 
the front page of The Times Orange County section showed homeless people -- 
since evicted -- living under an Orange County bridge because a few thousand 
dollars can't be found to provide them a temporary shelter. Beside this picture 
is a lengthy, upbeat story about the successful efforts to raise millions of 
dollars to rebuild the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier. First things first.

The Bush Administration today denied allegations by Panama's Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega that the United States paid $1 million to rebel officers to launch last 
week's failed coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nonsense," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"Absurd," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in Gulfport, Miss., that 
he would check the report out, but added, "I don't believe anything Noriega 
says." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega told reporters for The Times and the Boston Globe in an interview 
Wednesday night that Panamanian investigators discovered a bank account in the 
name of Capt. Erick A. Murillo, one of the alleged coup leaders, with more than 
$1 million. (Story, Section A, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian," Noriega was quoted as 
saying. "Six zeroes. It was a million-dollar account." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega also said Nicaraguan Contras delivered money and relayed messages 
between U.S. officials and coup plotters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first I've ever heard of something like that," Tutwiler said of the 
accusation concerning the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has said previously that U.S. officials were notified 
in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but did not play a part in 
planning it.

1,200 EVACUATED AT ROCKWELL PLANT AFTER FIRE NEXT TO CHEMICAL TANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO and RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,200 people were evacuated this morning from a Rockwell International 
plant in Canoga Park after a fire erupted next to a chemical storage tank in a 
building where space shuttle engines are manufactured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 57 people were examined by paramedics and doctors after 
complaining of feeling ill from fumes that may have escaped from the tank; 10, 
including three Rocketdyne firefighters, were hospitalized for observation 
after the fire at Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division in the 6600 block of Canoga 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was spotted about 9:20 a.m. next to a 900-gallon tank containing a 
highly toxic mixture of hydrofluoric and nitric acids and water that is used to 
clean stainless steel components of shuttle engines, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people working in the area at the time, but they got out right 
away," said Pat Coulter, spokesman for Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Boyd, manager of the area where the fire broke out, said he saw flames 
seven feet high next to the tank. The cause of the fire was still under 
investigation, but Assistant Fire Chief Alan Schroeder said the blaze may have 
been caused by a chemical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was in the sprawling plant's Building 1, a huge hangar-like shop where 
the shuttle engines are built, and two adjoining floors of engineers and 
designers' offices. The building was closed for the day after the evacuation 
and the employees were sent home, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said no liquid chemicals escaped from the tank and the leakage of 
fumes was probably minor. That led to some discrepancy in how authorities 
viewed the number of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have inhalation injuries -- nobody we would describe as being serious," 
Assistant Chief Paramedic A. N. Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that some of the complaints of illness were probably a reaction 
caused by hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
"There probably were some fumes in the building and any time people work in a 
building like this and they get a whiff of something . . . , " Schroeder said. 
"We send them to the hospital to determine if it is hysteria or an actual 
reaction to a chemical." 
</P>
<P>
Several people examined at the scene complained of scratchy throats, dizziness 
and nausea. Most said, however, that the evacuation proceeded quickly and 
orderly, as with company safety drills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was handled pretty smoothly, mainly due to the previous training 
that employees have had," said a man who complained of a sore throat after the 
evacuation. "There is a potential here for chemical hazards, and it's important 
that everybody here is well trained to handled this type of situation." 
</P>
<P>
The fire was initially fought by three Rocketdyne firefighters and then put out 
when city firefighters arrived, officials said. A total of 80 firefighters and 
five paramedic teams were called to the plant.

The U.S. Roman Catholic Church should drop its qualified support for teaching 
about condoms in public schools as a way of preventing AIDS, and should urge 
that youngsters be taught chastity instead, a committee of bishops said today. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as safe, or safer, sex. That's an illusion," said 
Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on the 
HIV Statement. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's draft statement revises an earlier document released by the 
church's 50-member Administrative Board in December, 1987, which said the 
church could tolerate public schools' providing information about condoms as 
long as sexual abstinence outside of marriage was presented as the "only 
morally correct and medically sure way" to prevent AIDS.

Russell Graham, 34, was arrested at 12:30 a.m. after police pulled over a 
pickup truck he drove away from a bar at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Sheldon 
Street, Detective Al Ferrand said. Graham was being held without bail in the 
Foothill Division jail in Pacoima on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said Graham is suspected of fatally shooting a 22-year-old man outside 
a 7-Eleven store at Woodman Avenue and Osborne Street in Panorama City on 
Wednesday, apparently during a robbery attempt. The victim's name was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that shooting, shots were fired at two men standing in the yard 
of a home in the 12200 block of Truesdale Street in another robbery attempt, 
Ferrand said. Neither man was hit. Forty minutes later a market in the 10100 
block of Stonehurst Avenue was robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they identified Graham from descriptions of the gunman and pickup 
provided by witnesses. Investigators watched the Sun Valley bar that he was 
known to frequent, and his pickup was spotted there early this morning.

PHONE RATE HIKES TIED TO INFLATION

The state Public Utilities Commission today scrapped its 50-year-old system of 
regulating telephone rates and adopted a new plan tying rates to inflation, 
encouraging new technology and promising Pacific Bell customers a rate 
decrease. 
</P>
<P>
"Local telephone companies are becoming more like competitive businesses and 
should be treated that way," commission President G. Mitchell Wilk said before 
the new system was approved on a 5-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and GTE California, the other company affected, both praised the 
plan. A consumer group, Toward Utility Rate Normalization, called it "a 
dangerous ride down an unmapped road." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, effective next year, is part of an overall policy by PUC members, 
appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, to loosen some of its traditional 
regulation and scrutiny of management decisions by utility companies in 
telecommunications, energy and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Current phone rates are based on the commission's determination of major phone 
companies' revenue needs, based on its costs, efficiency and the state of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, rates will be changed annually according to this formula: 
A federal inflation index called the Gross National Product Price Index will be 
reduced by 4.5%, based on the assumption that phone companies can increase 
their productivity by that amount each year. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if inflation is 4.8%, the figure shown by the index this past 
March, the rate increase would be 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The companies' basic rate of return on investment will be set at 11.5% as of 
Jan. 1. Carl Danner, an aide to Wilk, said the result will probably be a rate 
decrease of $100 million or more for Pacific Bell next year and probably little 
change for GTE, which had a 20% rate cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
If a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate of return, 
stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13%. Additional earnings up to 16.5% 
will be split 50-50 with ratepayers, and any amounts above 16.5% will belong to 
ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime next year, the $1.20-a-month charge for touch-tone telephone service 
will be eliminated, and the free local calling area will be expanded from eight 
to 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC said Pacific Bell will be allowed to spend $405 million to modernize 
its system over the next three years so that 950,000 customers will have access 
to services they lack.

COURT VOIDS CONVICTION IN PALME SLAYING;

<P>
JUSTICE: SWEDISH APPEALS PANEL FINDS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO LINK CAREER 
CRIMINAL TO PRIME MINISTER'S DEATH.

An appeals court today threw out the conviction of a 42-year-old career 
criminal accused of fatally shooting Prime Minister Olof Palme three years ago. 
Hours later, the defendant was freed from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Birgitta Blom of the Svea Court of Appeals said the court ruled there was 
not enough evidence to show that Christer Pettersson stalked and killed Palme 
as the Swedish leader left a movie theater with his wife on Feb. 28, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised. I never really believed I would be acquitted, although I am 
innocent," Pettersson, 42, told the national TT news agency after leaving the 
Kronoberg Prison with his lawyer and a police escort. 
</P>
<P>
Blom, the president of the appellate court, told Swedish radio the decision to 
overturn the conviction was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the culmination of a sensational case that authorities have 
been accused of bungling since its inception. Police for a year pursued a 
series of vastly different conspiracy theories before prosecuting Pettersson, a 
drug and alcohol abuser with a long and varied criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson was convicted in July even though no motive was established, no 
weapon was found and no witnesses testified to seeing the Swede fire five shots 
at the dynamic leader on a darkened street. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court judgment may be referred to the Swedish Supreme Court. But 
because the high court usually agrees only to hear cases that could form legal 
precedent, legal experts have said it probably will not hear Pettersson's case. 
</P>
<P>
Experts had said if the conviction were to be overturned it would be virtually 
impossible to find Palme's killer, since all the witnesses police could find 
pointed to Pettersson as the man they saw at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson's three-week appeal hearing was presided over by a jury of three 
laymen and four professional jurors. The hearing ended Monday.

Banner-waving youths opposed to Indonesian rule of East Timor fought 
baton-wielding police today in front of the altar where Pope John Paul II was 
finishing his blessing to a crowd of 100,000 in the capital of East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
Four women were reported hospitalized with injuries suffered after being 
crushed in the surging crowd during the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Hurling chairs and shouting "Viva independence!" and "Viva Papa!" about 20 
youths unfurled a banner in front of the altar. 
</P>
<P>
As the Pope looked on, plainclothes police hit the youths with canes. Much of 
the crowd scattered, but about 100 people came to the aid of the youths, 
hurling chairs at the police. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters were supporters of Fretilin, the pro-independence movement that 
has been fighting Indonesian troops since the Portuguese left the former colony 
in 1975 and it was annexed by Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
They got to within 100 feet of the steps to the high altar where the Pope stood 
watching. The Pope did not seem directly threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated the film of some photographers after the fighting ended 
about 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
White-cassocked priests and seminarians moved quickly to calm the crowd and the 
Pope was escorted to his car, surrounded by Vatican and Indonesian security 
men. John Paul is on a 10-day tour of South Korea, Indonesia and Mauritius. 
</P>
<P>
A non-Indonesian priest said it was clear that the protesters respected the 
Pope because they did not act until the Mass was over. 
</P>
<P>
During four days in Indonesia, the pontiff has urged the government of the 
world's most populous Muslim nation to protect human rights in East Timor. The 
local Roman Catholic Church and the human rights group Amnesty International 
say violations include mass arrests, torture and "disappearances."

The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today to two Americans and a West German 
whose work led to the atomic clock used as an international standard. The 
chemistry prize went to two Americans for the discovery of surprising 
properties of the genetic material RNA. 
</P>
<P>
The physics award was given to Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard University for 
measurement techniques that led to the cesium atomic clock, and to Hans G. 
Dehmelt of the University of Washington and Wolfgang Paul of the University of 
Bonn for a method to isolate single atoms and make exacting measurements of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genetic Research 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize in chemistry is shared by Thomas Cech, 41, of the University of 
Colorado, and Sidney Altman, 50, of Yale University. They showed independently 
in the 1970s and early 1980s that RNA, then thought to be merely a genetic 
messenger, could rearrange itself and produce chemical reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Their discovery "will probably provide a new tool for gene technology, with 
potential to create a new defense against viral infections," the Swedish 
Academy said. 
</P>
<P>
Half the physics prize will go to Ramsey, 74. The other half will be shared by 
Dehmelt, 67, and Paul, 76. 
</P>
<P>
"All three of them have developed exact methods of measurement, which has made 
it possible to conduct experiments that might force us to reconsider some basic 
physical laws, especially regarding time and space," said Ingvar Lindgren, 
chairman of the awarding committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prize Worth $469,000 
</P>
<P>
Each Nobel Prize is worth $469,000. 
</P>
<P>
Informed by the Associated Press that he had won the prize, Ramsey said: "Are 
you sure? It feels great. I'm just delighted, and I'm delighted with the people 
with whom I'm sharing the prize." 
</P>
<P>
Cech, reached in Boston, said: "My main emotion is that this is a great thing 
for the University of Colorado and the state of Colorado. This is not the sort 
of event that happens annually in the mountains the way it does in Boston. That 
gives me a really good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-born Altman, reached by telephone in New Haven, Conn., said, "I'm 
very happy. I'm very grateful to all my colleagues and co-workers, teachers and 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Americans have shared or won the chemistry prize 36 times among the 112 times 
it has been awarded since 1901. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two of the 134 recipients of the physics prize have been Americans. Last 
year's winners were Americans Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack 
Steinberger.

The farmer who found the 400-pound engine part suspected of causing a jet crash 
that killed 112 people learned today that she will get a reward of more than 
$100,000 from General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a shock," said Janice Sorenson, who found the piece while harvesting 
corn Tuesday with a combine. 
</P>
<P>
GE had offered a $50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from the rear engine 
of United Airlines Flight 232, which crashed July 19 in Sioux City, killing 112 
people of 294 people on board. GE manufactured the engine. Investigators 
suspect that the fan disk came apart, causing the engine to disintegrate and 
spew shrapnel that severed the jet's hydraulic system and made the plane 
virtually impossible to control. 
</P>
<P>
GE spokesman David Lane said the company would not give the amount of the 
reward. But a source close to the matter said it will be about $130,000, and 
Sorenson today said GE told her that it will be more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just in shock. I can manage $20,000, but this?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sorenson said she has no immediate plans for the money.

Two of the nation's biggest insurance companies, sued in one of the largest 
antitrust lawsuits in Texas history, have agreed to testify for the state and 
pay $500,000 in legal costs each, Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox said today. 
</P>
<P>
Mattox said Travelers Insurance Co. and St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance 
Co. also agreed to cease certain industry activities in the settlement 
agreement signed by state District Judge Pete Lowry. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, these companies have entered a (no contest) plea and have agreed 
to testify for the state as the lawsuit continues against the other 
defendants," Mattox said. 
</P>
<P>
The state is accusing the insurance industry of seeking to create a phony 
"insurance crisis" several years ago in which insurers claimed that an increase 
in lawsuits was forcing them out of the commercial liability field.

European Community negotiators have agreed to a compromise with the United 
States over limits on community steel exports, an EC spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The EC initially opposed Washington's demand to extend a so-called voluntary 
restraint agreement (VRA) that expired at the end of September, arguing that it 
is time the United States did its bit to liberalize steel trade. 
</P>
<P>
But it opted for a pragmatic approach, capitalizing on a new willingness to 
defuse potential rows in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We never wanted the deal, but if we were going to have to have one, a 2 
1/2-year deal is a credible step to liberalizing the steel market," the 
spokesman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had originally wanted a five-year pact to shield its aging 
steel producers and give them more time to adjust to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new deal, the community gets a small boost in its market share, 7% 
instead of the 6.68% in the previous accord. 
</P>
<P>
The accord also spells out that any disputes have to be settled by mutual 
consent, not by unilateral action from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Washington imposed VRAs to cut the market share of imports from 30% five years 
ago to 20.2%.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, plans to spend $15 billion in 
the next six years to maintain its supremacy in the oil market, regional 
bankers and oil industry analysts said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia wants to remain a market leader in the 1990s," one oil industry 
manager said. "It also does not want its share within OPEC to erode as world 
demand grows." 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry sources in the Gulf said the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco) 
wants to push the kingdom's oil output capacity to 10 million barrels per day 
by 1995 from the current 6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia's plan was a clear warning to some of 
its OPEC partners and to independent producers who might be planning expensive 
oil development schemes beyond the year 2000. "Would you contemplate a new 
investment in the North Sea if you heard the Saudis will double what they are 
producing now by 1995?" an oil industry executive said.

The machinists union at United Airlines has asked the Labor Department to block 
the proposed employee buyout of the airlines' parent company, claiming it 
violates laws governing the use of retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-page letter sent Wednesday to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole, the union charged that the tax benefits of the proposed $6.75-billion 
buyout "are effectively subsidizing a substantial and excessive windfall" to 
UAL Corp.'s management and United's pilots, the employee group spearheading the 
takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, United's pilots voted overwhelmingly to commit $20 million from 
their $1.2-billion pension fund to buy preferred stock in an employee stock 
ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots are the only UAL employee group so far committed to participating in 
the buyout.

The nation's trial lawyers called today for the recall of Lewis Red Devil Lye, 
warning that the drain cleaner available nationwide is explosive and its use is 
"akin to playing Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
The warning was the first in a campaign by the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of 
America to reveal information about dangerous products that is uncovered during 
litigation but is often kept secret under out-of-court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
American Home Products Corp., which sells the drain cleaner, acknowledged in a 
statement issued in New York that lye can be dangerous but said Lewis Red Devil 
Lye is safe when used according to label instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers group said it knows of 21 people who have been hurt when the 100% 
lye drain cleaner was poured down a drain and then "blew back" after mixing 
with water, showering the user with a burning mixture of lye and drain sludge.

New York Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield has agreed to pay $163,000 in alimony 
and attorney fees to a woman a jury ruled was his common law wife. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield agreed to the payment Wednesday, and he postponed his appeal of the 
jury's June ruling that he and Sandra Renfro had a common-law marriage from 
1982 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
State District Judge Allen J. Daggett had ordered Winfield to pay $13,500 in 
temporary alimony and child support to Renfro pending their divorce trial, plus 
$210,000 for attorney fees. Winfield had initially refused to pay more than the 
court-ordered child support for their daughter, Lauren Shanel, 6. 
</P>
<P>
Renfro's attorney, Earle Lilly, said Wednesday he received a check from 
Winfield for $163,000, an amount agreed upon by Lilly and Winfield's attorney, 
Tom Alexander. Lilly said Renfro will receive $33,000 in back alimony, and his 
firm will get $130,000.

Former NFL player Glen Collins was banned from broadcasting a game at an 
all-white academy because the former Mississippi State standout is black, a 
Jackson broadcaster claims. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Adams said he and Collins had been scheduled to broadcast the Aug. 25 
Jackson Academy-East Holmes Academy game on WJXN-AM from East Holmes. He said 
Collins was told he should not go. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who played with the Cincinnati Bengals and Green Bay Packers, could 
not be reached today for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who is white, said he did the game alone after being told by Jackson 
Academy Athletic Director Bobby West that Collins could not help broadcast the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he and Collins had worked together to broadcast public high school 
games and had been scheduled to broadcast all Jackson Academy games. However, 
he said Collins had a scheduling conflict the night of the academy games and 
would have been able to work only the game at East Holmes Academy. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby West called me a couple of days before the game and told me that Glen 
was not welcome up there (at East Holmes) because he was black," Adams said. "I 
told Glen. He thought I was kidding. He couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
East Holmes Headmaster Frank Drake denied Adams' claim. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not the case," Drake said. "I have never told anybody nor turned down 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he "never thought when I was getting Glen Collins about what color 
he was. He's a former NFL player who is qualified and knows a lot about 
football. He's the best person for the job. I thought we were past all that 
other stuff. I guess we aren't." 
</P>
<P>
West would not comment about the East Holmes situation, except to say, "I 
passed along the information given to me." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a racist school," the Jackson Academy's West said. "We welcome 
black students at any grade level. We are above racism. I don't know about the 
other schools, but I'm not going to say anything negative about another MPSA 
(Mississippi Private School Assn.) school. I don't want to be any part of a 
negative article." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said he had talked with Jackson Academy officials and "we would be 
welcome to do their (home) games," he said.

A Soviet round-the-world yachtsman whose body was found hanging from a tree in 
the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este on Wednesday committed suicide, Tass 
press agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
It said Alexei Gryshenko, 43, skipper of the yacht Fazisi, left a note asking 
his wife and parents to forgive him. "He expressed regret that he was unable to 
fulfill the role of captain adequately. This testifies to the fact that he 
suffered a nervous breakdown," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that he had been showing signs of stress before the 25-boat Whitbread 
Round the World race started and that his participation had been in doubt from 
the outset. 
</P>
<P>
Gryshenko, who co-skippered the 80-foot Fazisi with American Skip Novak on the 
first leg from Southampton, England, to Punta del Este, had been due to take 
sole charge of the 17-man crew for the rest of the 33,000-mile course.

J. Patrick Barrett, New York state Republican chairman, today withdrew his name 
from consideration for the NFL commissioner's job. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett was one of four finalists interviewed by club owners at their meeting 
in Grapevine, Tex., this week in their search for a successor to Pete Rozelle, 
who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I withdraw with regret," Barrett said in a statement. "Yet my withdrawal is 
necessary because I have family and business commitments that cannot be 
postponed any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett was considered a long shot. Other finalists are Jim Finks, president 
and general manager of the New Orleans Saints; Paul Tagliabue, an NFL counsel, 
and Willie Davis, a Hall of Fame defensive end for Green Bay.
