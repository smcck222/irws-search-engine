A PLACE WHERE SCRATCHED VINYL CAN BE GOLDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Lawrence Bausch says the sources of life's wisdom are often 
surprising. He said a fountain of insight might be right there in front of you, 
and you won't even know it. 
</P>
<P>
So, for his universal truths, he often heads to El Cajon Boulevard, to what 
used to be a massage parlor. 
</P>
<P>
It's now a record store -- Off the Record. You can buy a Beatles album for $450 
or sell one of your Johnny Mathis records for 10 cents. Actually, Johnny might 
be Mathis non grata at this place. 
</P>
<P>
But Bausch isn't. He's a loyal, paying customer, who finds nuggets of 
revelation tucked away in envelopes that don't -- unfortunately -- take away 
the scratches that work on the soul like fingernails on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
But as the man behind the counter points out, with a frizzy-haired shrug, life 
isn't perfect, is it? 
</P>
<P>
Bausch bought one of his favorite albums -- "Riding With the King," by John 
Hiatt -- at Off the Record, which revels in the offbeat, the forgotten and the 
never-knew-about, whether it's new, used or on album, tape or compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
Off the Record is the sort of store where the Severin Browne and Livingston 
Taylor sections are likely to be bigger than that of their brothers (Jackson 
and James). 
</P>
<P>
It's by no means the only vintage record store in the county, but, Bausch says, 
it's one of the best. And it is, as David Ritchie, one of its customers, 
pointed out this week, "funky to the max." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really one of the best in Southern California," said Bausch, the priest 
at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Ocean Beach. "I grew up in Los Angeles, but 
I've lived in San Diego since 1966, and I love music, so I've been to lots of 
stores like this." 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, Bausch happily discovered the Hiatt album, parts of which 
have made their way into Ocean Beach sermons. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this great song on there called 'You May Already Be a Winner,' " he 
said. "This guy keeps getting all this sweepstakes junk mail, like we all get, 
with the headline, 'You May Already Be a Winner!' He talks to his wife about 
it, and they laugh about it, and then he realizes that, because of the way they 
care for each other and the love that they feel, they're winners in a way that 
money can never duplicate." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Farkas said that Off the Record, which he co-founded with Richard 
Horowitz in 1978, has brought them exactly that kind of happiness. He and 
Horowitz were working for Wherehouse Records, which Farkas said simply refused 
to stock the marginal, the bizarre or the in-your-face "punk" music that they 
longed to sell. 
</P>
<P>
They opened on El Cajon Boulevard 11 years ago, added a "used" store next door 
five years ago and have since invaded Encinitas and Hillcrest, where a new 
store opens next month. 
</P>
<P>
Farkas is proud of the fact that the Irish rock band U2 was on the shelves at 
Off the Record long before the masses discovered the group. He likes the 
store's status as an "underground" shop, where even the artists themselves 
occasionally wander in. Band members from Husker Du and singer Henry Rollins 
are among the faithful who Farkas says often find what they need at Off the 
Record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Singles Found 
</P>
<P>
In the singles rack, you can find a category for Paul and Paula, a bubble-gum 
'60s duo, whose one hit was "Hey, Paula." Incredibly, you can't find that one, 
but you will find a string of other Paul-and-Paulaisms, such as "Holiday 
Hootenanny." 
</P>
<P>
"We like being thought of as an alternative place," store manager Keith Larson 
said. "We're really not for the people who like to listen to Whitney Houston or 
George Michael. In our new section, we tend to start where Tower (Records) and 
(the) Wherehouse stop. And, in the used building, well, you might find Frank 
Sinatra and the Sex Pistols side by side." 
</P>
<P>
Bausch says he's found records at Off the Record, which caters largely to a San 
Diego State University crowd, that he could find nowhere else: The early work 
of country artist Nanci Griffith and Irish classics by the likes of Tannehill 
Weavers and Ossian. He says he shops at Rockaway Records, Lou's Records in 
Encinitas and the Blue Meanie in El Cajon. He likes them all but says "Off" is 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Farkas, 38, said he has so many record albums that he didn't want to say for 
publication how many. 
</P>
<P>
"That many?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That many," he said with a worried look. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worried About CDs 
</P>
<P>
He says the business has been a thrill, but he worries about the impact that 
compact discs may soon have on discount houses such as his. He carries CDs, but 
the vast majority of sales are records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be real interesting to see what happens," he said. "It could end 
up like baseball cards, where it's a market mainly for collectors. Ten-year-old 
kids are no longer getting record players for Christmas. They're getting CD or 
tape players. I find that kind of sad. 
</P>
<P>
"I love records. As a kid, I loved watching them spin around on the turntable. 
I'd like to think there will be this huge market for vinyl, but 78 (r.p.m.) 
records are worthless and eight-track cassettes are worthless, so will 
long-playing records be worthless, too. Five years from now, it may be that one 
part of our store will be new stuff -- CDs -- and the other part will be vinyl 
meant for collectors. Like me." 
</P>
<P>
It may be, as Farkas pointed out, that lots of records will cost as much as the 
Beatles album on the wall with a price tag of $450. It's the original "The 
Beatles: Yesterday and Today," which bears a rarely seen cover with the Fab 
Four wearing butchers' outfits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the genuine article," Farkas said, with Bausch noting that that's pretty 
much what the store is.

CANCER VICTIM WHO COULDN'T FLY HOME DIES

A terminally ill Air Force employee who unsuccessfully sought passage aboard a 
government air ambulance to spend his last days in his Massachusetts hometown 
has died, a Lancaster medical center spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Avram Brody, 25, of Palmdale died late Tuesday, said a spokesman with the 
Antelope Valley Neuroscience Medical Group. Brody had been determined to have 
an inoperable brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Brody, who worked as an electronics engineer at Edwards Air Force 
Base for three years, was angry over the government's refusal to fly Brody to 
Norwood, Mass., where he grew up. Air Force officials said regulations 
prohibited granting the request because he was a civilian.

HOMELESS, HOUSING NEEDS CITED IN REQUESTS FOR HUD GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Rickords wants Los Angeles officials to use federal community development 
funds to build showers for the homeless, but a group of Panorama City investors 
says the need for affordable housing in the San Fernando Valley is more 
pressing. 
</P>
<P>
Those were among the requests from residents throughout the city that officials 
will consider when they divide about $50 million in grants from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, said Stephen Rodriguez, an 
administrator with the city's Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal regulations, the funds may be spent on improving housing for low- 
and moderate-income residents and on a variety of social programs, such as rape 
hot lines and AIDS projects. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, officials listened to requests from San Fernando Valley residents 
during a public hearing attended by 30 people in Pacoima. The hearing was one 
of four mandatory meetings to be held throughout Los Angeles this month under 
HUD guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Housing is the most important problem facing poor people," said Ken Mitchell, 
a Canoga Park businessman seeking funds for a Panorama City investment group to 
build low-income housing in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming more and more apparent that people cannot afford to buy houses 
and have places to live anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rickords, a spokeswoman for the Valley Mayors' Fund for the Homeless, said 
her nonprofit group believes building showers for the homeless is equally 
important. "Unless the homeless have a place to clean up, there's no way they 
can find work," she said, and showers are important for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne E. Mariajimenez, an attorney for San Fernando Legal Services of Pacoima, 
said her nonprofit group is applying for HUD funds "to provide free legal 
services for indigent people who are faced with foreclosures, immigration and 
welfare problems." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said city officials will begin reviewing applications in April from 
individuals and social service agencies for federal funds allocated for fiscal 
year 1990-91. Those attending the meeting were asked to fill out surveys, 
copies of which will be given to City Council members to assess community 
needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has the final say over how the funds will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
This fiscal year, Los Angeles received about $50 million from HUD, placing the 
city third in the nation in terms of size of grants after New York and Chicago, 
Rodriguez said. The federal agency allocates the grants based on population, 
income levels and age and condition of housing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles will actually spend about $70.8 million in HUD funds this fiscal 
year because of money left over from previous years, Rodriguez said. More than 
half of the funds, or about $39.6 million, will be used to improve housing 
through low-interest loan programs and rental subsidies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Separate figures for the San Fernando Valley were not available. 
</P>
<P>
The city will spend about $7.1 million on economic development, such as 
rehabilitating rundown commercial districts, including several strip malls on 
Van Nuys Boulevard in Van Nuys, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
About $4.4 million will go to developing or improving neighborhood facilities, 
such as day-care centers and city libraries. Federal funds from HUD helped 
build the Boys and Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley, where the meeting was 
held Thursday, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has allocated $8.4 million for public services, such as rape hot lines 
and drug and anti-gang programs. 
</P>
<P>
About $11.3 million of the funds will be used to pay for administering the HUD 
grants, including monitoring the recipients, Rodriguez said.

JURY AWARDS $7.5 MILLION TO PARALYZED RAPE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court jury awarded $7.5 million in damages to a 
paralyzed woman who was raped and made pregnant in a North Hollywood nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital grossly negligent in protecting 
patient Andrea Nerpel, 38, who has lived at the nursing home since she suffered 
major brain damage in an automobile accident when she was 19. 
</P>
<P>
Nerpel, who is fed through a tube in her stomach and cannot speak or 
communicate meaningfully, was raped in 1982. A pregnancy was discovered by her 
grandmother about three months later, and Nerpel was given an abortion and 
sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
Before jury deliberations began Wednesday, Judge David M. Schacter instructed 
jurors that they could award damages based only on the consequences of the 
negligence. They could not award punitive damages against the nursing home 
because there was no evidence of malice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the monthlong trial, defense attorney Richard B. Castle argued 
that there was no evidence that Nerpel suffered from the rape, saying her 
medical condition was unchanged since then. 
</P>
<P>
But jurors said the rape might have been an emotional trauma for Nerpel, 
although she was unable to express her pain. Videotape shown during the trial 
indicated that Nerpel is aware of her surroundings and people who come to see 
her, jurors said. In the videotape, Nerpel smiled when her grandmother entered 
the room, and her eyes followed the moving camera. 
</P>
<P>
"They were never able to prove that she has no sense of feeling or that her 
mind is not working," said jury foreman Michael D. Williams of Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors agreed that Laurelwood was negligent in its duty to protect Nerpel. 
About six months before she was impregnated, Nerpel was moved from a room in 
front of a nursing station to one farther down the hall. Jurors felt that she 
should not have been moved because she was so helpless, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 12 said they believed that $7.5 million was appropriate 
compensation for her suffering. Several jurors said they believed that Nerpel 
was raped repeatedly because of the slim chance that one rape would result in a 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Nerpel's medical expenses are about $4,500 a month, said her attorney, Alan J. 
Schultz, and the award settlement will be placed in trust to pay them. Nerpel's 
grandmother is her only living relative, he said, adding that he does not know 
who pays her medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Castle said Laurelwood's parent company, Western Medical Enterprises, will 
appeal the award. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the jury in a state of emotion decided to punish 
Laurelwood," Castle said. "An emotional issue can defeat justice. The only 
damages were to compensate Andrea for the harm that she suffered, but there is 
no evidence of that. Nobody knows if she knows she was raped or not."

<P>
Frank Fisher couldn't believe the news, the first good news he had heard in a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago a brush fire destroyed his house in Saugus, forcing Fisher and 
his wife of 63 years, Mabel, to live in a trailer on the property ever since. 
Then in August, their landlord cut off their electricity and water in a lease 
dispute, leaving them without utilities for 55 days. 
</P>
<P>
So Thursday morning it was hard for Fisher, 82, to believe that the owners of 
Apple Homes, a mobile home dealership in Canyon Country, had offered the couple 
a new $35,000 mobile home free of charge. The mobile home dealers, brothers 
Robert and Pat Milan, had already found a space for the unit at a mobile home 
park in Canyon Country and said they would pay the $275 monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to do something to help you two," Robert Milan told the Fishers at 
his office, saying he had read newspaper accounts of their plight. The couple 
had been brought there by their attorney, Richard A. Patterson, who on Oct. 2 
won a court order forcing the landlord, Bill Jordan, to re-connect the 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher didn't understand at first. He thanked the Milan brothers for their 
interest but said there was no way he could afford to buy a mobile home. Then 
the news sank in. 
</P>
<P>
It was all free. 
</P>
<P>
He looked stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be a beggar," he protested. Mabel Fisher, 85, possibly 
embarrassed, just looked away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to impose on anyone," Frank Fisher continued. "All my life I've 
been able to work. You can't do it for free." 
</P>
<P>
But Patterson reminded Fisher that the stress of the dispute over the lease had 
aggravated a heart condition. "You can't work," Patterson said, pleading with 
him to accept the gift. 
</P>
<P>
The Fishers stood quietly, thinking. 
</P>
<P>
The house that burned to the ground two years ago was to have been their 
retirement home. A tough man with a sharp tongue, Frank Fisher built the home 
himself after a lifetime of unusual jobs, from stunt man and chef to ambulance 
driver and used-car salesman. He once wrestled bears in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
The Fishers obtained a lease to live on the remote Saugus property, along 
Hasley Canyon Road, 19 years ago. But Jordan maintained that the lease, which 
expires Dec. 20, 1990, became void when the house was destroyed. He also said 
the trailer was a hazard because the electricity had been connected illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson admitted that Los Angeles County ordinances do not allow a trailer on 
the property. All he wanted, he said, was time to find a new residence for the 
Fishers. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday morning, the Fishers repeatedly resisted Patterson's pleas. "I'm 
better off in the damned trailer," Frank Fisher said. "All my life I've paid my 
way." 
</P>
<P>
"You've had a lot of bad luck and it's time you had some good luck," Pat Milan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Fishers were taken to Sierra Park, a 75-space mobile home park 
along Soledad Canyon Road. The Milans and another Apple Homes employee, Duke 
Eriksen, let the couple tour a home, saying it was identical to one already 
ordered for the Fishers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mabel Fisher spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother lives here," Pat Milan said. "You'll be her neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
The Milans then led the Fishers to a vacant trailer space shaded by a large oak 
tree. Their mobile home would go here, the Milans said. It will be ready in 
about a month. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time all day, Mabel Fisher smiled. She and her husband had a new 
home. "I've have a lot of surprises in my life, but I ain't never had one like 
this," Frank Fisher said as tears filled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how grateful I am. I don't have any words."

SEPULVEDA WOMAN GETS 3-YEAR TERM FOR KILLING SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Sepulveda woman who stabbed her son to death during a quarrel over $50 was 
sentenced Thursday to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber gave Sammie Lavern McGee, 38, the 
relatively short term because she had no prior criminal record and feels 
remorse for the killing. Voluntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
With credit for time she has already served in jail and work performed while in 
custody, McGee will be eligible for parole in 45 days, Haber said. 
</P>
<P>
McGee pleaded guilty May 31 to one count of voluntary manslaughter in the May, 
14, 1988, death of her son, Bluefus Davis, 18. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for McGee's guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious 
charge of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, whom police said was a gang member, was found lying in the living room 
of his mother's apartment in the 14600 block of Parthenia Street. He was later 
pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said McGee picked up a steak knife and stabbed Davis once in the 
chest after he told her he was a gang member and "nobody messes with me." 
</P>
<P>
Some friends and family members told police McGee stabbed her son after an 
argument over his refusal to pay $50 in phone calls, for which his mother had 
been billed. Other witnesses contended that McGee wanted the money to buy 
cocaine, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Plafker, prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Plafker argued for a mid-range prison term of six years. 
</P>
<P>
McGee's attorney, Phil Nameth, had asked that McGee be sentenced to probation, 
saying she had suffered enough while incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
A Department of Corrections psychologist evaluated McGee and recommended 
probation, Plafker said.

POLICE ARREST WOMAN SOUGHT IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman sought in the slaying of her former roommate was arrested after a Los 
Angeles police officer sighted her car outside a bar and she was found inside, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Crue, 42, of Van Nuys was arrested at 8 p.m. Wednesday in the bar in the 
7200 block of Sepulveda Boulevard, Lt. Warren Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
Crue had been sought since Saturday, when firefighters found the burned body of 
Carol Hix, 39, in the bedroom of her Van Nuys apartment in the 15800 block of 
Vanowen Street, police said. Investigators determined that Hix had been shot to 
death before a fire was started in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Crue was believed to have been the woman that neighbors saw leave 
the apartment shortly before the fire was noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Crue was arrested after Sgt. John Day sighted her car while on patrol on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. She was arrested without incident after identifying 
herself to Day and other officers inside a nearby bar. 
</P>
<P>
Crue was being held without bail on suspicion of murder.

RTD BACKS EAST VALLEY METRO RAIL EXTENSION; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: DIRECTORS GO ON THE RECORD AS SUPPORTING A POPULAR SUBWAY PROPOSAL 
RATHER THAN LIGHT RAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District on Thursday 
endorsed a widely supported plan to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood 
Metro Rail subway across the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of RTD Director Nick Patsouras, the board without dissent 
gave its support to a plan unveiled several months ago by state Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is studying Valley route 
options and also whether the system should be underground in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD would operate any line built in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
RTD spokesman Jim Smart said that while directors normally steer clear of route 
decisions, "this alignment has drawn so much support that the board decided to 
get on board." 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins-Braude Metro Rail proposal was offered as an alternative in May to 
ground-level light rail, which also is being studied by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Because Metro Rail is far costlier than light rail, Robbins and Braude envision 
extending the line initially only from the Metro Rail station at Chandler and 
Lankershim boulevards in North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which has the support of most homeowner and business groups, 
passengers bound for the West Valley would transfer to buses at a station near 
Victory and Balboa boulevards in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was incorporated into a bill Robbins sponsored in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation passed both houses but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, 
who said that route decisions should be made locally.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was killed Thursday when the car he was driving crashed 
into a parked car in East San Diego, a San Diego police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim reportedly fell asleep while driving east on Home Avenue about 12:40 
a.m., Sgt. Mike Healey said. The car veered across the double-yellow line and 
smashed into a car parked along the north curb, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was pronounced 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Healey said the coroner's office has been unable to determine the victim's

TRANSIENT ARRESTED IN ROBBERY SPREE SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect in a 40-minute robbery spree that left one victim dead was arrested 
Thursday morning after he was sighted leaving a Sun Valley bar, Los Angeles 
police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Graham, 34, a transient, was arrested at 12:30 a.m. after police pulled 
over a pickup truck he drove away from a bar at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and 
Sheldon Street, Detective Al Ferrand said. Graham was being held without bail 
on suspicion of murder at the Foothill Division jail in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said that on Wednesday Graham fatally shot a 22-year-old man near a 
phone booth outside a 7-Eleven store at Woodman Avenue and Osborne Street in 
Panorama City. The victim, whose name was not released, apparently was shot 
during a robbery attempt, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the noon shooting, the same suspect -- in another attempted 
robbery -- fired shots at two men standing in the yard of a house in the 12200 
block of Truesdale Street, police said. The shots missed, and the gunman fled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at 12:40 p.m., the gunman robbed a market in the 10100 block of 
Stonehurst Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were able to identify Graham from descriptions of the gunman and his 
truck provided by witnesses, Ferrand said. Investigators watched a Sun Valley 
bar he was known to frequent, and his pickup truck was sighted there early 
Thursday.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REDUCES ACTOR'S SENTENCE BY A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court judge has reduced by one year the sentence of an 
actor charged with felony drunk driving during a crash that injured a Studio 
City man and his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Richard G. Kolostian, who sentenced Kenneth 
Charles Swofford to 28 months in June, reduced the sentence by one year 
Wednesday, saying it was a hardship on Swofford's family and that he had erred 
in making the initial sentence so stiff. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford's attorney, John Yzurdiaga, had requested the sentence reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford, 55, who played a high school principal in the television show "Fame," 
which aired in syndication until 1987, had pleaded no contest at an earlier 
hearing to drunk-driving charges stemming from the Dec. 11 accident. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford was driving west on Ventura Boulevard when his car swerved into 
oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into a car driven by George Charous, 37, 
of Studio City. Charous suffered a broken leg and fractured spine. His son, 
Paul, 11, suffered a skull fracture, and his other son, Stephen, 6, suffered a 
broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the initial sentencing, Kolostian noted that the actor had no 
prior history of arrests or convictions, but the judge said he was going to 
give Swofford a stiff sentence because "unless a first-time drunk driver is 
sentenced to jail time, we won't have any effect on drunk drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a plea bargain, Kolostian could have given Swofford a maximum 
sentence of four years. 
</P>
<P>
Kolostian also ordered Swofford to pay $9,600 in restitution to the Charouses.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRIPS MEMBER GETS 17 YEARS IN SHOOTING OF 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the terms of a plea bargain, a 22-year-old member of the Crips gang was 
sentenced Thursday to 17 years and four months in prison for shooting five 
members of a rival gang during a dispute over drug-selling territory, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Young, originally charged with seven felonies, pleaded guilty to four 
counts of attempted murder for the June 30, 1987, attack. Five Bloods were shot 
with a .45 semiautomatic pistol at a Van Nuys apartment complex, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Ed Nison. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the five were seriously wounded, including one who was shot seven times. 
All recovered. 
</P>
<P>
In connection with the same attack, Bruce Lee, 22, of North Hollywood was 
sentenced Thursday to seven years in state prison in exchange for pleading 
guilty to three counts of assault with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of the shootings, Lee -- also a Crip -- accompanied Young to the 
apartment complex in the 12700 block of Van Nuys Boulevard, Nison said. Lee had 
a gun but did not fire, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Nison said Young belonged to a downtown Los Angeles group of Crips and was 
trying to link up with Valley gang members to expand the gang's drug network. 
He and Lee, a local gang member, had argued with the Bloods earlier in the day 
and returned to the complex to "settle the score," Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were in the complex responding to an unrelated call and heard the 
gunfire in the courtyard. Young and Lee escaped but were arrested three days 
later. They pleaded guilty on Sept. 25, moments before lawyers were to begin 
picking a jury for the trial.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: MENU AT DEL MAR BISTRO GARDEN MORE LIKE AN 
EPICUREAN FASHION PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the decade lazes to a close, the menu at the Del Mar Bistro Garden at the 
new and agreeable Del Mar Inn suggests a minor if fascinating revelation about 
the cooking of the 1980s: ingredients have become comparable to hemlines. 
</P>
<P>
A glance down the list of entrees reads something like a Fifth Avenue fashion 
parade for foods. Those ingredients that may as well have come off the designer 
shelf are noted here in italics, and are numerous. In the 1990s, at least a few 
of them presumably will go the way of the mini or the maxi, perhaps to return 
in a later age. 
</P>
<P>
There are, for example, Wisconsin duckling with cepes, and a "California coq au 
vin" of chicken braised in Zinfandel with pancetta, onions and carrots. The 
sauteed boneless breast of chicken arrives stuffed with goat cheese and basil, 
the Norwegian salmon mesquite grilled with cilantro beurre blanc. Grilled jumbo 
shrimp may be naked and unsauced, but they garnish a bed of angel hair pasta 
dressed with tomato concasse, herbs, lemon juice, shallots and olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
In '80s terms, the menu would be incomplete without five spice baked halibut 
with black and pink peppercorns. It also gets the necessary accents from the 
morels that garnish the veal chop, and the onion confit that glamorizes the 
otherwise Plain Jane New York steak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Ageless Classics 
</P>
<P>
However, just as a few very proper ladies always wear their hems at mid-calf, 
the menu concludes with two ageless classics, a rack of lamb roasted with 
rosemary and garlic, and filet of beef with goose liver pate and truffled brown 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The nice thing about this roster of ingredients is that it has greatly expanded 
our eating options, both by introducing novelties that formerly belonged only 
to specific ethnic cuisines (pancetta is Italian belly bacon, for example), and 
by internationalizing others, as in the cilantro beurre blanc, which puts a 
Mexican accent on a quintessentially French butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
These dishes add up to a fine menu for the Del Mar Bistro Garden, a 
descriptively named eatery that encompasses a pair of dining rooms and a 
handsome outdoor terrace. Dinner is possible outside, but because Southern 
California restaurant patrons generally disdain the great outdoors at night, 
the garden terrace sees most of its action at lunch; the dining rooms, with 
their high pitched ceilings and white walls, have a sort of French country look 
but the casually chic atmosphere typical of the North County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Trendiness is the watchword in all departments of the menu, which starts out 
calmly enough with an appetizer of oysters on the half shell, but plunges 
immediately into ahi sashimi (thinly sliced raw Hawaiian tuna with Japanese 
seasonings), gravad lax (Scandinavian cured salmon), a casserole of snails and 
cured ham and, for the nutritionally nervous, a plate of mesquite grilled 
vegetables with garlic mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition returns briefly on the soup list with the onion soup gratinee, but 
vanishes again with the lobster and leek bisque en croute. This soup had the 
potential to be good, but it tasted of commercial lobster soup base, included 
far too much leek and was canopied by soggy, half-baked commercial puff pastry 
that would have been happier had it remained in its box. Caesar and spinach 
salads dominate the greenery patch. But the less assertive Bistro salad is 
really quite nice, because it stylishly tosses the best greens with fresh 
herbs, lemon and a mixture of oils. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blended and Balanced 
</P>
<P>
Pizza and pasta also appear, as they virtually must these days, and 
occasionally in wild guises, such as the moo shu shrimp pizza and the 
lobster-stuffed ravioli with cream, Port and rosemary. The angel hair pasta 
with sauteed scallops and a lightly creamy sauce elaborated from decent 
Chardonnay is calmer and quite tasty, the flavors beautifully blended and 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entrees, the grilled veal chop is outstanding. All that really is 
required here are a thoughtfully cut, well-trimmed piece of meat and a cook who 
knows how to grill it, both elements usually lacking with restaurant veal 
chops. The Del Mar Bistro Garden did send out a carefully done chop, however, 
and the forest-perfumed morel mushrooms, so perfect for the meat, were lavishly 
apportioned. The plate garnish included a fancy arrangement of crisply cooked 
tiny yellow squash, waffle-cut carrots and pea pods, as well as a small cake of 
gratin dauphinoise, or cream-scalloped potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The grilled giant sea scallops also pleased, not only for the lightness of the 
kitchen's touch (they were barely done, and ever so juicy), but for the 
brilliant, emerald-colored tarragon puree that gave them such a lift. Color and 
much additional flavor also came from the topping of grilled red bell pepper 
bits, which were arranged in decorative crowns atop each of the shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert cart offers mostly catered products and is of limited interest. But 
guests who plan ahead and order the Belgian chocolate souffle when they give 
the dinner order will find themselves, at meal's end, dipping up a Sybaritic 
soup of gooey puffed chocolate and velvety custard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
This restaurant's luncheon menu also is quite attractive. Many items repeat 
from dinner, but the composed salads are served only at lunch and are sometimes 
stunning. 
</P>
<P>
The finest salad is the Del Mar Cobb, which substitutes crab, shrimp and tiny 
scallops for the traditional turkey and bacon and carefully decorates them with 
avocado, tomato and a wonderfully generous sprinkling of crumbled blue cheese. 
The California chicken salad also is handled well, the sliced breast meat 
tossed with raspberry vinegar and deliciously musty walnut oil for moistening, 
and with snow peas, lettuces and shredded vegetables for substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Unusual Sandwich 
</P>
<P>
None of the sandwiches were sampled, but the list includes an ahi "burger" of 
grilled tuna steak on a bun with marinated roasted peppers and avocado; a 
sandwich of roast turkey carved from a whole roasted turkey rather than from 
one of those insidious commercial turkey rolls, and an unusual club sandwich of 
mesquite grilled chicken breast with pesto mayonnaise, bacon, lettuce and 
tomato. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entrees, the only dish that does not also appear on the dinner list 
is the crab and spinach omelet. The kitchen included plenty of crab in the 
fluffy egg mixture (James Beard said that shellfish must be served lavishly or 
not at all, and it is impossible to disagree), but the flavor overall was quite 
flat. The simple addition of an herb -- tarragon would be ideal -- would have 
brought up both the crab and the eggs, and melded them into something far 
better than this workmanlike but dull omelet.

MORNING BRIEFING: G. ROLLIE WHITE DOWNS IS PROOF ALL'S NOT BIGGER, BETTER IN 
TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Beyer of the Washington Post, on the opening of pari-mutuel horse racing 
in Texas last weekend: 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't at a grand facility in Houston or Dallas. The first thoroughbred 
racing was conducted in the town of Brady (Pop. 5,976), best known as the home 
of the world championship barbecue goat cook-off. Brady is so rural that signs 
at the local motel advise patrons, 'Do Not Clean Birds in the Room.' 
</P>
<P>
"The track in Brady is G. Rollie White Downs, and its first day of racing drew 
a crowd of about 4,000 who wagered a meager $188,975. The crowd figure was an 
estimate because G. Rollie White Downs has no turnstiles to count the patrons. 
Nor does it have a clubhouse or a press box. Nor do the tents serving as the 
makeshift clubhouse and press box have any electricity, although this was 
viewed as a blessing by some patrons. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The tents were ankle-deep in water,' said Randy Moss of the Arkansas 
Democrat, 'so if we'd had electricity, we'd probably be dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
Question of attitude: Steve Buckley of the Hartford Courant reports that the 
Oakland Athletics will not go into the World Series as flat as they were last 
season against the Dodgers. He quotes Jose Canseco: "The experience of having 
been there last year means so much. . . . I think I tried to do too much last 
year. I'd come up with nobody on base and try to hit a three-run homer. That 
won't happen this time. I'm just going to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Add Buckley: A reporter asked A's shortstop Mike Gallego about the status of 
his wrist. "I cracked my wrist three years ago, and now I have somebody asking 
how it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the only American League staff without a 100-strikeout 
pitcher this season? 
</P>
<P>
No mistake about it: Richard Justice of the Washington Post quotes Chicago Cub 
reliever Les Lancaster on pitching to San Francisco Giants' first baseman Will 
Clark: "Oh, he can be pitched to. It's just a matter of getting the ball there. 
If you don't put it in the right spot, he makes you pay. That's what separates 
good and great hitters. A good hitter will occasionally miss a mistake bad. 
Will Clark didn't miss any pitches (during the National League playoffs.)" 
</P>
<P>
Add Justice: Clark on hitting: "I start thinking about that day's pitcher the 
morning of the game. It might be earlier. I'll look in my book or maybe look at 
a videotape if there's something I want to check on. I'll usually get three or 
four other opinions. You need to go up there with some idea about what the 
pitcher wants to do with you." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The New York Yankees. Andy Hawkins had 98 going into his last 
start but had no strikeouts in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>

Someone made him." GARR KLUENDER

TV-RADIO: ELVIS DIDN'T SHOW, BUT QUIP ENDS UP HAUNTING COSTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If, during a World Series game, Oakland has a big lead in the ninth inning with 
Dennis Eckersley pitching, don't expect ABC-TV announcer Al Michaels to say 
something such as, "The Giants have about as much chance of coming back as 
Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the line has already been used -- by NBC's Bob Costas during the 
ninth inning of Game 2 of the Toronto-Oakland American League playoff series. 
At the time, the Athletics led, 6-3, and Eckersley was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Costas simply meant that the Blue Jays didn't have much of a chance of winning 
the game. A Toronto newspaper columnist apparently thought Costas meant that 
the Blue Jays didn't have a chance of coming back in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Costas was Public Enemy No. 1 in Toronto. Things got so bad, when he 
registered at his hotel in Toronto, the security people recommended that he use 
an assumed name. 
</P>
<P>
The one he came up with isn't exactly obscure in Toronto: Ben Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels has empathy with Costas. "Bob and Tony Kubek did a fabulous job during 
that series, but all you hear about is that one line," Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
"Network announcers root for one thing, and one thing only -- good theater. 
They want great games, classic endings, interesting managerial decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Michaels is going home for this World Series -- sort of. He was an announcer 
for the San Francisco Giants in 1974, '75, and '76 and continued to live in the 
Bay Area for nine more years after he was hired by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Michaels and his family moved to Brentwood, where he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is, I know the Bay Area, I know the fans," he said. "I've seen 
some banal features portraying San Francisco fans as white collar, Oakland fans 
as blue collar. You won't hear anything like that from me. 
</P>
<P>
"The sense I get is that most people in the Bay Area are thrilled both teams 
are in it. There isn't a lot of animosity between Giant and A's fans." 
</P>
<P>
About two hours before Game 1 of the World Series begins Saturday in Oakland, 
another sporting event will be taking place a few miles north in the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
USC will play football against California in Berkeley at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This game has had more time changes than a cheap wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
It was originally scheduled for 1 p.m., then 12:30, then 7:30, and finally 
3:30. 
</P>
<P>
It was first moved to 12:30 for ABC. But the network instead picked 
UCLA-Arizona, at least for the West Coast. Most of the nation gets 
Michigan-Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad ABC doesn't do a national doubleheader instead of one split-national 
telecast. Surely, West Coast fans would also like to see Michigan-Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, after ABC made its move, Cal made a deal with ESPN and changed the 
starting time of its game with USC to 7:30. ESPN also agreed to provide 
portable lights, since Cal's Memorial Stadium has no lights. But Cal's 
chancellor, Ira Michael Heyman, nixed the night game, saying it would 
inconvenience fans and also create security problems. 
</P>
<P>
In making that decision, he didn't endear himself to Cal's athletic department, 
nor to USC. An ESPN telecast would have been worth $200,000 to each school. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise was reached. Heyman agreed to a 3:30 kickoff, permitting the game 
to be televised by Prime Ticket and a network of seven regional affiliates, 
which together reach 22.5 million homes in 24 states. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket pays $100,000 a school, so each school lost only $100,000 in 
potential revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket also must provide lighting, since the game will end after dark. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman deserves credit for putting the interest of his school's fans ahead of 
television and the almighty dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The new gametime created another problem for USC, since its flagship station, 
KNX, is also carrying CBS Radio's World Series coverage. A 3:30 start for the 
football game meant it would overlap into the 5:30 baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, KNX decided it would leave the football game and insert periodic 
reports. That's what the station did last Saturday, when Game 4 of the American 
League playoffs extended well into the second quarter of USC's game with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But missing the start of a game isn't as bad as missing the ending. So USC 
Athletic Director Mike McGee made a strong pitch to KNX late Thursday and got 
George Nicholau, the station's general manager, to agree to farm out the game 
broadcast. KDAY (1580) will carry it in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kudos to Channel 11 sportscaster Tom Nettles and producer Martin French for the 
feature they did Saturday night on Dorsey High School football player Kevin 
Copeland, who died last Friday night during a game against San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
French, a former USC defensive back from Fairfax High, and a crew went to the 
Coliseum to do some interviews since several Dorsey players were there to see 
their former teammate, Beno Bryant, now a freshman running back for Washington, 
which was playing USC. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant was also interviewed and said Copeland was his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the feature was Nettles' sensitive and emotional live 
interview with Copeland's older brother, Ron Jr., a sophomore at USC. Ron said 
he and his brother were both aware of the history of heart problems in their 
family, but both had undergone physicals and been given a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved my brother," Ron Copeland said. "He was also my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
ABC-TV's World Series coverage will begin at 5 each game day, with the games to 
start at about 5:30. The game announcers are Al Michaels, Tim McCarver and Jim 
Palmer. . . . CBS Radio announcers for the Series will be Jack Buck and Johnny 
Bench. . . . ESPN will televise a one-hour World Series preview today at 4 p.m.

umpiring in the minor leagues. Joe Garagiola (remember him?) is the host. . . . 
MTV will televise a World Series special Sunday from 4 to 8 p.m., with a number 
of Giants and A's making guest appearances. . . . From Jeff Miller of the 
Dallas Morning News: "File this one away: Brent Musburger, CBS play-by-play man 
for the next four seasons, noted on CBS Radio that Mark McGwire bobbled a 
grounder 'out of bounds.' " 
</P>
<P>
KMPC's Jim Healy reported the other night that a disc jockey for San 
Francisco's KNBR, the Giants' flagship station, got the team's Mike Krukow on 
the phone for an interview before last Monday's game against the Chicago Cubs. 
Said the disc jockey, according to Healy: "Sorry we got you out of the shower." 
Said Krukow, not knowing he was on the air: "Oh, I wasn't in the shower. I was 
. . . " Healy, to give listeners an idea of what Krukow was doing, played his 
toilet-flushing sound effect. . . . According to the latest Arbitron radio 
ratings book, which covers the summer months, Healy easily won his 5:30-to-6 
p.m. time slot in the males, 18-and-over category. He had nearly twice as many 
listeners as KABC, which finished ninth in the same category. . . . Frank 
Robinson will be a guest on the "Pat Sajak Show" tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Pro football Sunday: The 10 a.m. CBS game on the West Coast will be the San 
Francisco 49ers at Dallas, with Tim Brant and Dan Jiggetts reporting, while 
most of the country gets Washington and the New York Giants. At least the 
Redskin-Giant game can be heard on KNX. NBC, at 1 p.m., will provide L.A. with 
another look at the Denver Broncos, who play the Indianapolis Colts. The

Garrett, Anthony Davis and Craig Fertig. . . . KRTH-AM has been sold and is 
expected to go to a Spanish-language format around Jan. 1, pending FCC approval 
of the sale, meaning the Clippers will be in the market for a new radio 
station. The team is hoping the sale isn't approved until after the basketball 
season.

NHL ROUNDUP;

MODANO, CASEY HELP NORTH STARS REMAIN UNBEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie Mike Modano scored his fourth goal in as many games and goalie Jon Casey 
made 24 saves for his second shutout as the North Stars remained one of only 
two unbeaten National Hockey Lehue teams with a 3-0 victory over the St. Louis 
Blues Thursday night at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars, who had a 27-37-16 record last season, lead the NHL with a 
3-0-1 record for seven points. The New York Rangers (3-0-0) are the other 
unbeaten team. 
</P>
<P>
Casey recored his only other NHL shutout March 18, when he beat Buffalo, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 5, Winnipeg 4 -- Gerald Gallant scored two goals and defenseman Rick 
Zombo scored a goal and assisted on another as the Red Wings won their home 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
After Steve Yzerman's power-play goal 6:18 into the second period trimmed 
Winnipeg's lead to 3-1, the Red Wings scored twice in 12 seconds midway through 
the period to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Gallant, who begins a five-game suspension Oct. 19 for a stick-winging 
infraction, deflected Zombo's shot past Jet netminder Tom Draper to cut the 
lead to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
After the ensuing faceoff, Zombo stole the puck from Winnipeg's Randy 
Cunneyworth along the boards, skated to the faceoff circle and beat Draper with 
a wrist shot to the far side. 
</P>
<P>
Tony McKegney stuffed a wraparound shot past Draper with 2:39 remaining in the 
period to put the Red Wings ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Quebec 2 -- Rick Tocchet scored a rare power-play goal for the 
Flyers as they beat the Nordiques at Philadelphia for their first win of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tochet's goal was only the Flyers' second with a manpower advantage in 18 
attempts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 9, Toronto 6 -- Denis Savard's second goal of the game on a breakaway 
broke a 5-5 third-period tie, and Doug Wilson had two goals and two assists as 
the Blackhawks won at Chicago.

COLLEGE NOTES: LOYOLA CAGERS LOOKING FOR SOME GAIN WITH THEIR PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount basketball team came into the gym after running laps 
around the soccer field one day last week -- puffing, sweating and looking 
forward to practice Sunday after more than a month of tough conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
One of those happy to be feeling the pain was senior guard Bo Kimble, whose 
tagline the last two seasons has been: lots of pain, no gain. 
</P>
<P>
Bo knows pain. The 6-foot-5 shooting machine managed to put up some big numbers 
for Loyola in spite of knee injuries that sidelined him for a month as a 
sophomore and required arthroscopic surgery as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
From the bench last season, he watched boyhood friend Hank Gathers lead the 
NCAA in scoring and rebounding. For the player who can stand up to the rigors 
of Coach Paul Westhead's system, gaudy statistics and a potential spot high in 
the pro draft await. Indeed, with Kimble seeing what amounted to spot action, 
the Lions still shattered the NCAA scoring record, averaging 112.5 points per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead and Kimble himself have continued to assert that nobody has seen the 
player at 100%, although he has had some scorching performances -- scoring 68 
points in two games the same week against Pepperdine as a sophomore and 40 
points in a game last season against Gonzaga. Part of Kimble's physical 
problems last season were laid on him for sloughing off on his summer 
rehabilitation exercises. 
</P>
<P>
And last season, when several games were lost in the final minute, Loyola was 
left wondering what might have been with a healthy Kimble in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
That's all in the past, Kimble said. Showing off a new, buffed-up physique, 
Kimble is coming off a summer in which he led Philadelphia's summer league in 
scoring and, he says, faithfully stuck to his rehab exercises. "I shot 500 
baskets a day," he said. "That's my job. This is gonna be a big year. You've 
never seen anything like you're gonna see this year at Loyola. We're gonna 
break (scoring) records all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Hills soccer teams appear to be headed in opposite directions 
after the men suffered another tough conference loss Wednesday and the women 
continue to roll along at 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
The men bowed to Cal State Northridge, 1-0, to fall to 0-2-1 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. and 6-5-1 overall. They need to win virtually all 
their remaining CCAA games to have a shot at the title. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Cano, who coaches both teams, had high hopes for the men, who returned a 
veteran lineup from last year's CCAA co-champion team. But the Toros' offense 
has had trouble rolling. In their conference opener last week, they needed a 
late goal by Martin Mira to tie Chapman, 1-1. Over the weekend, a strong Cal 
State Bakersfield team took a 3-0 lead and held off the Toros, 3-2. Wednesday's 
loss to No. 4 Northridge was a heart-breaker, with the Matadors scoring the 
game's only goal 88 minutes into play. 
</P>
<P>
"We're struggling. We can still (contend) with seven games left," Cano said. 
"My concern right now is to get a W (win) on the board. It's not that we're 
playing badly -- of the three (CCAA) games we've played we've dominated all 
three -- but we're losing. Our offensive punch is not there. I've got to find a 
way to give 'em some kind of punch, maybe make a couple little changes." 
</P>
<P>
Among the ploys Cano has tried is getting thrown out by the officials 
Wednesday, when hefelt Northridge was getting the calls. "It seemed like (the 
referee) was being lazy. I said, 'You're not running.' Boom, I was gone. I 
wasn't worried about being ejected. I wanted to give (the team) a boost," he 
said. "But then a minute later Mira gets ejected and we play the rest of the 
game 10-on-11. We just couldn't mount any kind of attack." 
</P>
<P>
Cano said the other CCAA teams may be discounting the Toros at this point, 
which should take off the pressure. "Now maybe we can play loose and have some 
fun. Maybe that's what we need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros resume CCAA play Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The women, ranked No. 2 in Division II, should get a good test at home Sunday 
against unbeaten UC San Diego, which is ranked No. 2 in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
On a roll (sort of): Since snapping a six-game losing streak, the Loyola 
Marymount men's soccer team has won two of its last three games and hopes to 
make it two in a row Saturday afternoon at home against Cal Lutheran. The 
Lions, 3-10, got their first victory against a Division I opponent Tuesday at 
home, defeating U.S. International, 2-1. In the last three games the Lions have 
scored seven goals after managing only four in the first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The hot player for Loyola in the last week has been junior forward Ken 
Warcholik, whose goal against USIU on Tuesday gave him four, tying him with Jan 
Klein for the team lead. Halfback Eric Hill, another freshman, also scored his 
second goal of the season. Freshman forward Tom White assisted on both scores. 
</P>
<P>
There is a downside, however. Over the weekend, the Lions played a West Coast 
Conference game at the University of San Francisco, a Top 10 team that 
manhandled them, 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Dominguez Hills' volleyball match tonight against top-ranked UC 
Riverside will be televised on Paragon Cable. Paragon also will show volleyball 
matches Nov. 3 against Cal State Northridge and Nov. 10 against Cal State 
Bakersfield. It's part of a package deal with Paragon that includes five 
upcoming men's basketball games. The games will be shown on a tape-delay basis. 
. . . The Dominguez Hills women's volleyball team set several team records last 
week. Maria Romero set one with seven service aces in a match against Cal State 
San Bernardino, helping the Lady Toros set a team record with 18 aces. Freshman 
Angela Hamer set another mark for hitting percentage with a .520 success rate 
in one game, and transfer Julie Berthiaume set a fourth record by recording 
seven block assists. . . . In West Coast Conference volleyball, Loyola setter 
Anita Irwin is third in assist average at 10.15 per game. Santa Clara's Julie 
Jamile of Torrance is next at 9.56. . . . Loyola junior Kerry House and 
freshman Dana Bragado have entered the WCC leaders in service ace average at 
.60 per game. . . . Dominguez Hills women's soccer standout Kristi White needs 
one goal to match the school career record of 29. She has extended her school 
career record for points to 84.

HUNTERS PLAY KEY ROLE IN CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Certain animals of the wilderness are hunted and harvested at certain times of 
the year to allow humans a variety of game and to keep a balanced reproductive 
population of that species. As for domestic livestock, it's slaughtered 
according to demand. We can find domestic animals prepackaged for purchase, no 
feelings felt for the animal we never saw. For the hunter, game is a variety of 
meat. Deer are not killed daily like livestock. 
</P>
<P>
As for cruelty, it happens all the time all over the world. Wild and domestic 
animals are abused, maimed and driven out constantly, with or without the 
hunter. Cruelty to animals is something that can be caused by nature itself.

CRESPI PRESENTS UNEXPECTED CHALLENGE TO LOYOLA IN LEAGUE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by its surprising performance in the past four games, the upstart 
Crespi High football team may be poised to beat Loyola tonight and position 
itself for something that eluded the Celts during the Russell White years -- a 
Del Rey League title. 
</P>
<P>
White, the state's all-time leading rusher and now a freshman at Cal, led 
Crespi to the Southern Section Big Five Conference title in 1986. But the Celts 
lost two of three games to Loyola with White and finished no better than second 
in the league three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi and Loyola are both 4-1 entering the league opener and are ranked fourth 
and fifth, respectively, in the latest Division I poll. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do everything we're supposed to do we have a chance," said Tim Lins, 
Crespi's first-year coach. "I think offensively they're better than I've ever 
seen them." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, Loyola Coach Steve Grady has posted a 10-2-1 record against the 
Celts. Like many others, Grady anticipated a down year at Crespi. The team 
needed to rebuild after losing Coach Bill Redell, quarterback Ron Redell, now 
playing at Stanford, and White. Instead, Crespi followed an opening loss to 
Redlands with victories over Hart, San Fernando, Servite and Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
"When you lose as much talent as they lost . . . but, boy, I think they're darn 
good," Grady said. "They don't have the big names, but the kids they have can 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Lins has succeeded in keeping his team focused on the game at hand during the 
past few weeks but says this game has loomed large. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (ignoring Loyola) was impossible," he said. "I think in the back of 
everybody's mind the word 'Loyola' was there. I don't think we were thinking 
ahead, but we might have thought about it once or twice last week. We don't 
want to put too much emphasis on it. For us, it's just another step to where we 
want to go." 
</P>
<P>
And for Lins, the real season begins tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done so far doesn't count," he said. "We just want to finish what 
we started." SAM FARMER

HUNTERS PLAY KEY ROLE IN CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letters you printed Sept. 30 in response to the article "Changing Stripes" 
show, unfortunately, how ill-informed the public really is. Our news media and 
the so-called "Friends of Animals" have no concept of what conservation is and 
the role hunting really plays. If it wasn't for the revenues generated and the 
donations made by the hunting community, there wouldn't be any "Bambis" left. 
The true conservationist understands that we must balance the land, the animals 
and the amount of space that man allows nature to be as she once was before man 
changed the ecological balance with concrete and steel. Conservation costs 
money, and, by allowing a certain number of animals to be harvested for a fee, 
we can afford to maintain their habitat and environment and promote the 
continuation and growth of the species. 
</P>
<P>
The true big-game hunter doesn't just kill to kill but uses the animal he 
harvests for food and the trophy for the memory of the hunt. Nothing is wasted. 
Not everyone can be a true hunter. People eat fish, fowl and meat, and just 
because they didn't kill their food doesn't mean that it wasn't killed. Fish 
die by suffocation, fowl by mechanical strangulation and meat by wholesale 
annihilation. Is this compassionate? I think not!

THREE SIDELINED AS SDSU PREPARES TO START PRACTICE

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego State basketball team will start practice Sunday with three 
players, including guard Michael Best, on the sideline with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Best, a senior, is recovering from surgery two weeks ago to remove two screws 
from his left knee. The screws were inserted during Best's senior year in high 
school to repair knee damage. 
</P>
<P>
Best, who averaged 12.5 points and 4.4 rebounds last year, is returning after 
missing the final two weeks last season for medical reasons unrelated to his 
knee problem. 
</P>
<P>
Also out are guard/forward Nelson Stewart and center Marty Dow. Stewart, a 
junior transfer from College of Eastern Utah, had arthroscopic surgery two 
weeks ago on both knees. No damage was found in the right but cartilage was 
repaired in the left knee, trainer Mark Haines said. Stewart is expected to 
practice later next week. 
</P>
<P>
Dow, a 7-foot junior transfer from Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M, has a disc 
ailment and received further treatment Thursday, Haines said. No date has been 
set for Dow's return. CURT HOLBREICH

Donald Cogsville, the Sockers' first-round draft choice from University of 
North Carolina, signed a one-year contract Thursday. No other Socker 
first-round selection has ever signed with the professional team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was aware of that dismal fact before I got here," Cogsville said. "I knew it 
was going to be tough because the Sockers have won so many championships, and 
they have so many veteran players." 
</P>
<P>
Cogsville, 24, led the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring last year with 14 
goals and was a member of the U.S. national team for seven months in 1988. He 
will switch from forward to defender. DON PATTERSON

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: ALL EVIDENCE MUST BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have served on a jury in either a civil or criminal case you know that 
you had to deal with "evidence" as allowed and presented in the case. And, if 
you recall, much of the time in the jury room was spent "weighing all the 
evidence" to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Proving a pedigree -- say, for example, proving that your father, Charles 
Endicott, was the son of a particular William Endicott -- requires that you 
gather evidence to support your "case." You must analyze this information and 
present it to all who may someday want to know how on earth you arrived at the 
conclusion Charles Endicott was the son of William, when they have evidence 
that Charles was the son of Ebenezer. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence simply means information. The information may be correct. It may be 
false. But a genealogist must consider all evidence when compiling a pedigree. 
A genealogist is really a one-person jury who must consider what information to 
accept or reject. Conclusive proof is not possible in genealogical research. 
</P>
<P>
You may be able to prove Charles was the son of Mollie Clark Endicott (if there 
was a credible eyewitness to his birth), but that still will not prove his 
paternity, even though said Mollie was the wife of William at the time, and 
presumably the father of the child. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of personal knowledge for most genealogies, the rule is that 
ancestry may be established by a preponderance of the evidence. This does not 
mean that if six sources say Charles is the son of William that is 
"preponderance." Preponderance means the quality of the evidence, not 
necessarily the quantity of it. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you find a valid will in which William named Charles as his 
son, that is considered very reliable evidence. And even if 10 other sources 
(of lesser quality) disagree, the preponderance of the evidence is that found 
in the will. 
</P>
<P>
In genealogy identifying individuals is always a problem. There may have been 
three or four William Endicotts -- of similar age and living in the same locale 
-- who could have been the father of your Charles. You must check out all these 
individuals. Even if you find only one William Endicott in the right place and 
time and of the right age, you must establish his identity in order to "prove" 
he is the father of your ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
Genealogical evidence has another problem: the validity of references. If 
references are given -- and too many genealogies being compiled today do not 
even include references, let alone proper citation of them -- you must check 
the original sources. Do not rely on secondary sources used as references. Many 
mistakes in genealogies have been perpetuated for generations and reprinted 
numerous times. Be aware that there has been fraud, honest error, negligence 
and incompetence in the compilation of genealogies, local histories and record 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
The best book on this subject, a book all serious genealogists should read, is 
Noel C. Stevenson's "Genealogical Evidence: A Guide to the Standard of Proof 
Relating to Pedigrees, Ancestry, Heirship and Family History," available from 
Aegean Park Press, P.O. Box 2837, Laguna Hills, Calif. 92654 for $20.80 
postpaid. (California residents must add sales tax.)

"Family Diseases: Are You at Risk?" It is available from Genealogical

CULTURAL REVELATION IS AIM OF 2-DAY KIDZARTZ FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
Art for kids' sake. That's what the KidzArtz Festival is all about. 
</P>
<P>
This comprehensive cultural enrichment event, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday 
in Balboa Park, is designed to spread the word about the arts to San Diego 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor festival will feature artists from a myriad of disciplines, at a 
dozen locations throughout the park. Music, dance, opera, drama, puppetry, 
literature, painting, mime and sculpture are all part of the vast potpourri of 
live performances, demonstrations and hands-on, arts-related activities heading 
our way this weekend -- all free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
KidzArtz, the brainchild of Elaine Krieger, was created in 1987 as a way of 
exposing children to the full palette of arts experiences, and it took off like 
a rocket. Last year, the one-day event drew more than 25,000 people, and the 
overwhelming response from participants, as Krieger explained, was that 
"there's too much to see and do. We need two days." 
</P>
<P>
That was music to Krieger's ears, and she immediately set out to expand this 
year's festival to a full weekend, despite the uphill battle to fund it. The 
list of activities and number of participating artists has burgeoned as well. 
In fact, the festival slate will be jammed both Saturday and Sunday, with many 
events running concurrently. The hours are 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 11 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of effect can this shotgun blast of exposure have on children with 
absolutely no arts background on which to build? 
</P>
<P>
Former soccer star Juli Veee, youth chairman of the festival and one of more 
than 50 artists on this weekend's roster, believes the festival has the power 
to change lives. 
</P>
<P>
"One minute of exposure to something (artistic) can make all the difference," 
he said. "If they see some children playing the violin, they 
</P>
<P>
might decide they want to play -- instead of doing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was exposed myself as a child in Hungary. Here, children are exposed to 
athletics more than anything else. And that's a mistake. I always had two 
careers, soccer and painting. 
</P>
<P>
But being a sports hero "is one-dimensional," he said. "It dies. But art has a 
lasting effect on a person. It's not right that athletics get the biggest 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
KidzArtz is not just kids' stuff, as Veee pointed out. "Parents are hungry for 
it, too. They want to get involved when they watch the kids." 
</P>
<P>
California Ballet dancer Jewel Tiveten, one of many San Diego dancers scheduled 
to appear at KidzArtz, is living proof that a little can go a long way to 
impress a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the San Francisco Ballet's 'Nutcracker' when I was only 5, and when I 
watched Linda Meyer dance the Sugar Plum Fairy, I really thought she was a 
fairy," Tiveten recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping I can make that kind of magic for somebody else -- and I think it 
can happen in just a few minutes. After I saw that ballet, I knew I had to be a 
ballet dancer, and I begged my parents for two years until they agreed to let 
me take lessons." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Garbutt, principal tuba player with the San Diego Symphony, will lead 
14 colleagues in a performance at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion during his brief 
appearances at KidzArtz Saturday and Sunday. But he has no intention of making 
it a passive experience for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to give group lessons in conducting," Garbutt said. "We'll pass 
out white straws and show them the beat patterns, the dynamics, entrances and 
exits. We'll even pick a few kids to actually conduct on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think the conductor just stands there and swings his arms. I'll 
conduct the first movement and then explain what I did," he said. "If somebody 
is interested in conducting, great. But at least we hope to give everyone more 
of an appreciation for what a conductor does. Children are not usually exposed 
to anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the artists, including the Clogging Company (scheduled for a 30- minute 
stint at the Puppet Theatre on Sunday), will concentrate on performing. But 
even then, there are lessons to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll explain a little of the history of clogging," said Jean Adkins. "We 
won't do a lot of talking, but we'll tell them about its origins as a hillbilly 
art form in the Appalachians. Children adapt to clogging very easily, so it's 
very good for young people." 
</P>
<P>
Dancer Susan Wingfield, whose local performance credits date back to the heyday 
of the now-defunct San Diego Ballet, will teach creative movement to 5- and 
6-year-olds, and take the older children through the rudiments of jazz dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I taught last year, and I couldn't believe the response," she said. "After 
they watch dance groups perform all morning, they're so glad to be able to get 
up and do it. I do a grand march that gets everybody up -- even the littlest 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
Musician Richard Lawrence will use sound structures as "a medium to create a 
dialogue, a language," he explained as he assembled the elaborate percussive 
frame he uses for his music making. And the benefits should extend to the 
classroom as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll show the children the different textures and frequencies. I allow them to 
hear the sounds and then make them for themselves. Children are inquisitive," 
he said. "This is a tool for developing learning skills and improving their 
attention span." 
</P>
<P>
All this child's play is tough work for head honcho Krieger, whose biggest 
challenge is raising funds for the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a budget of $154,000 this year," she said. "We've raised nearly 
$60,000, but the festival needs community support in order to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Krieger appears to devote her energy to this once-a-year event with missionary 
zeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I know if the children are exposed to enough positive things, it will have an 
effect," she said. "This is the third year, so we're continuously touching 
their lives and pushing them forward. By keeping the festival free of charge, 
we're making it available to everybody. We're even busing in 2,500 children 
from low-income areas, and we want to do more and more of it every year." 
</P>
<P>
Corporate sponsors, such as Play Co. Toys, have jumped on the bandwagon because 
they feel KidzArtz fills an important gap. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a lot for sports, but this is basically a way of making the children a 
little more rounded," said company Vice President Howard Labow. "The kids need 
KidzArtz."

The New York City Opera officially canceled its fall season Thursday and 
threatened the same for its spring program unless striking musicians agree to a 
contract by next month. The 69-member orchestra has been without a contract 
since June 1 and struck on Sept. 13, opening night of the fall season. On 
Saturday, the union voted, 56-4, to reject a pact, and the opera said then that 
the season, scheduled to end Nov. 19, would be canceled if the orchestra 
members did not return. Martin Oppenheimer, the company's vice chairman and 
lead negotiator, said Thursday that "obviously, we are extremely saddened by 
this development because it puts out of work hundreds of innocent people who 
rely on these jobs for their livelihood." John Glasel, president of the union 
local, called the cancellation regrettable and said that the opera management's 
deadline for reaching a contract "exemplifies the Neanderthal negotiating style 
of the company." The opera and its musicians have been divided over wages and 
the number of work weeks that orchestra members are guaranteed annually. 
Musicians earned $755 a week under the old contract. ALEENE MacMINN

Cable News Network has silenced its "unchallenged commentaries" but will 
continue to air commentaries and their opposing views on such programs as 
"Crossfire," "Evans &amp; Novak" and the "Capitol Gang." A spokesman at CNN 
headquarters in Atlanta said "it was just a management decision" to end the 
free-standing commentaries of Linda Ellerbee, Robert Novak, Marty Schramm, 
weatherman Flip Spiceland and sportscaster Jim Huber. All of the commentators 
except Ellerbee do other work for CNN. Among the network evening newscasts, 
only NBC still regularly airs commentary by John Chancellor. George Will 
comments for ABC News on an irregular basis. CBS discontinued commentaries 
after Bill Moyers, who delivered them, quit in 1986 and returned to public TV.

Claudio Abbado says his appointment this week as conductor of the Berlin 
Philharmonic will not interfere with his post as musical director of the Vienna 
State Opera. "I am profoundly honored. Naturally I accept the appointment but I 
won't leave Vienna," the 56-year-old Abbado said in an interview with the Rome 
newspaper Il Messaggero. Abbado, successor to the late Herbert von Karajan, 
also said that he did not expect to become Berlin's chief conductor for life 
like his predecessor. ALEENE MacMINN

Nikolaus Lehnhoff, who created and produced the San Francisco Opera's "Ring of 
the Nibelung" four years ago, has pulled out of the company's planned 1990 
revival of the Wagner cycle because of what he termed an unworkable rehearsal 
schedule. Lehnhoff, in a letter to company general director Lofti Mansouri, 
said the schedule made it impossible to achieve "even a blueprint" of the 1985 
original production. The San Francisco Opera has booked four presentations of 
the four operas that make up the "Ring" next June and July. Mansouri said he 
would personally supervise the production team to mount the revival. ALEENE

<P>
A COMPELLING FABLE IN 'DEMONS IN SPRING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The title of the poetic, compelling fable "Demons in Spring" (at the Little 
Tokyo Cinemas) refers to the white crests of waves caused by the collision of 
warm and cold currents in the sea off Sanriku, the northernmost district of 
Japan's main island of Honshu. In ancient times, the people of Sanriku believed 
that every spring the breakers carried with them a demon. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 25 years, actor-turned-director Akira Kobayashi has wanted to 
film the Tokuhei Suchi novel inspired by this legend. It was worth the wait, 
for "Demons in Spring" uses the familiar stylized conventions of the Japanese 
period picture to create a unique and stunning experience. 
</P>
<P>
As a darkened sky rages with thunder and lightning, Saburoshi (Masaru Matsuda), 
a handsome, muscular young fisherman, manages to rescue Yuno (Sachiko 
Wakayama), his well-born, fragile-looking true love, from an arranged marriage. 
They escape by sea, only to wash up nearly drowned on the shores of Sanriku. 
According to custom, as strangers they should be thrown back into the ocean to 
appease the gods, but a wise village elder (Toshiro Mifune) intervenes. Yet 
they face a fresh ordeal as the masked village chief (Sakae Takita) orders 
Saburoshi to undergo a series of superhuman feats before being allowed to claim 
Yuno as his wife. 
</P>
<P>
This severe testing of the hero, as much a staple of Western mythology as of 
Eastern, gradually gives way to a consideration of how ancient peoples employed 
ritual and sacrifice to try to make sense of a harsh and unpredictable 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
The chief, who clearly has designs on Yuno, and his soothsayer mother (Keiko 
Tsushima) seem at first merely figures of sadistic evil. They acquire tragic 
dimension as we come to realize that they are concerned with the survival of 
the community, which suffers periodic outbreaks of plague. (Interestingly, the 
chief's audiences with his people, held in a large structure of silvery natural 
wood, are every bit as formal as those of an emperor or a shogun, even though 
the kimonos of these humble, fearful subjects are virtually rags.) 
</P>
<P>
In its attempt to understand customs that might easily be dismissed as ignorant 
superstitions, "Demons of Spring" is reminiscent of both Shohei Imamura's 
"Kuragejima: Legends From a Southern Island" and the more recent "Himatsuri." 
Above all, "Demons in Spring" is an adventure-filled tale very well-told, 
thanks to Kobayashi's skill and passion and to the gifts of screenwriter Ryuzo 
Kikushima, one of the Japanese cinema's most distinguished veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Like Kikushima and Mifune, composer Masaru Sato has also been a frequent 
Kurosawa collaborator, and all three contribute strongly to the film's 
resonance. As for Matsuda and Wakayama, they recall the beauty and innocence of 
Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour in John Ford's "Hurricane."

'BLACKOUT' IN THE USUAL PSYCHO-THRILLER STEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A clean, sunny, all-American town; a nubile blonde wandering distractedly 
through the streets; her crazy relatives; her attentive old boyfriend. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That's all part of the usual psycho-thriller stew in "Blackout" (at selected 
theaters) and director Doug Adams doesn't handle it any more notably than 
dozens of other copycats who have preceded him. Hitchcock set the rules of the 
game and Roman Polanski, in "Repulsion," gave them baroque embellishments. But 
the only real distinction of this sub-"Psycho," sub-"Marnie" lady-in-peril 
pastiche lies in the fact that "Psycho's" original scenarist-adapter, Joseph 
Stefano, was coaxed back into refashioning Adams' script. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, it's one more dive into the skeleton closet of twisted sex, 
voyeurism and murder. Here, Adams gives us yet another beautiful, disturbed 
young woman -- Gail O'Grady as Carolyn Boyle, wandering through yet another 
town crawling with guilty secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Summoned by a letter from her long-missing father, Carolyn returns to her Santa 
Paula hometown. She gets a great greeting: Her mom (Carol Lynley) points a 
shotgun at her and tells her to get out of town; her smarmy Uncle Alan (Michael 
Keys Hall) grins and fawns over her and pretties up her old room, and her old 
boyfriend Luke (Joseph Gian) tags around like an obtuse puppy dog. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula proves to be one of those mysteriously half-deserted places where 
guilty secrets, violence and repressed desire lurk under a bucolic surface and 
people stay taciturn unless they have an important plot development to 
disclose. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is going on involves bloody screwdrivers and horrible flashbacks, sex, 
slaughter and creepy memories -- and something vile that happened in Carolyn's 
bedroom. People either get lost in enigmatic musings or wander up and down 
staircases, paralyzed with dread. Peep-holes are drilled through the floors, 
smudge-pots go up in the orange grove outside, mysterious deaths accumulate and 
broad hints are dropped constantly about grisly goings-on in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
Cliche after banality after questionable twist pours out of the movie's macabre 
jack-in-the-box. There's no way to become more than passively interested in any 
of it. "Blackout" (Times-rated Mature for sex, language, nudity and violence) 
shows a commendable effort to convey menace through atmosphere and camera 
movement rather than accelerating blood and gore. And Hall's smarmy uncle and 
Joanna Miles' frightened old flame have a few good moments. Other than that, 
you'd have to be in a 20-year blackout yourself not to guess what will happen 
in the attic or to care very much when it does.

TWICE THE DEAD WEIGHT NEEDED IN OLD FORMULA FOR 'DEADWOOD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the self-consciously Chandleresque mystery saga "From Hollywood to Deadwood" 
(at the AMC Century 14), fledgling writer-director Rex Pickett wants to operate 
within the hard-boiled detective tradition, but his movie is merely scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
The story has all the tough, cynical conventions of classic film noir: private 
eye (or eyes, since this version has two heroes) sent off in search of a 
troublesome-but-beautiful brunette who turns out to be less femme fatale than 
tragic victim. Private eyes find that their employer(s) had much more sinister 
reasons for hiring them than was at first naively assumed. Feeling used and 
implicated in the evil, the detectives wreak the necessary justice and wind up 
slightly tougher and more cynical than when the piece began. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad little pattern for a dramaturgist to follow. But the predecessors 
Pickett is straining to emulate, reached their dark, pulpy conclusions out of 
some dark, real-life sensibilities that had real weight. "Deadwood" is full of 
dead weight, the heavy weight of homage, and the weight of truth in the maxim 
that film schools turn out auteurs who make movies mostly about other movies. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest wrinkle Pickett introduces into the old formula is in providing the 
plot with two detective heroes. The effect, though, seems less for innovation's 
sake than for the sake of grafting the buddy-movie formula onto the existing 
one. One detective, Raymond Savage (Scott Paulin), falls for the knockout 
target of their search, while the older, wiser, harder-drinking of the two, 
Jack Haines (Jim Haynie), tries to knock some sense into his love-struck 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
The missing person in question is luscious Lana Dark (Barbara Schock), who 
disappeared, apparently in a prima donna huff, from a movie set and shut down 
production at great cost to some possibly slimy producer types who've hired our 
heroes. That this obscure object of desire does not turn out to be a Garbo-like 
head turner when we finally catch up with her in Deadwood, S.D., is not all 
that surprising. The entire picture is wildly miscast, lead actors included. 
</P>
<P>
To reinforce the forced art-vs.-reality subtext of the picture, there's a 
black-and-white film-within-the-film, full of allusions to such classics as 
"Out of the Past." This sepia-toned homage is pale in more ways than one. "From 
Hollywood to Deadwood" (MPAA-rated R for language) -- is the work of a major 
film fan, not a major film maker.

STAGE BEAT: 'MADAME MAO' AT THEATRE/THEATER; 'PALABRAS' AT THEATRE/TEATRO; 
'COWARDS' AT STRASBERG; 'A . . .' AT CELEBRATION; 'SISYPHUS' AT OFF RAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madame Mao, facing another morning under permanent house arrest, rises from her 
prison cot and undertakes her daily regimen with a quiet fury that suggests 
she's quite capable of seizing power once again. How dare the People's 
Republic, her revolution, restrict her to sewing dolls, reading newspapers and 
watching television. "China is my medicine, and I will be cured!" 
</P>
<P>
"Madame Mao's Memories," a solo woman's play in the 22-seat matchbox at the 
rear of Theatre/Theater, is to Chairman Mao Tse-tung's widow what "Evita" is to 
Eva Peron. The production takes a powerful woman figure more media-infamous 
than human and, through the force of artistic imagination and sufficient 
historical detail, fills her with life. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Kim Miyori, playwright Henry Ong and director Robin McKee create a 
mesmerizing drama, a non-judgmental portrait of a day in prison with Madame Mao 
surgically dissecting her political and personal lusts. Among the memories, 
Miyori re-creates the spider lady's pre-Mao Shanghai stage career, when she was 
known as Jiang Qing and performed Ibsen's Nora in "A Doll's House." 
</P>
<P>
Much later, inflamed with power, she is the Red Guard architect purging 
"artists, dreamers, sex, beauty, love and intellectuals" from the face of 
China. "Hail the Cultural Revolution!" she smirks, her ferocity threatening to 
burst the walls of her confinement. 
</P>
<P>
(After Chairman Mao's death in 1976, Madame Mao, arrested with the Gang of 
Four, momentarily faced a death sentence that was commuted to life in prison. 
Today, languishing in house arrest at 74, she is reported to be suffering from 
throat cancer.) 
</P>
<P>
Miyori is mercurial in her moods and makes Madame Mao's plunge from arrogant 
power timeless and placeless. 
</P>
<P>
"Madame Mao's Memories" is also a crackling woman's play. "I am not an ornament 
of Mao's," the burnished character snaps, teasing back her hair in the 
reflection of her mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Ong's dramatic license gives this work its verisimilitude. Madame 
Mao's ritualistic exercises earmark her unshakable resolve, with a brooding 
refrain: "Once I was at the zenith of power. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Oberman's lighting design imaginatively enhances the moody realm of 
stress and storm. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1713 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays at 
7:30 p.m., through Nov. 5. Tickets: $10-$12; (213) 466-1767.

'Divinas Palabras' 
</P>
<P>
The Bilingual Foundation for the Arts, dipping into exotica, is staging the 
U.S. premiere of a 1920 Spanish play, "Divinas Palabras" ("Divine Words"), by 
maverick Spanish playwright Ramon del Valle-Inclan, unknown here. 
</P>
<P>
But the English-language version at the foundation's Theatre/Teatro leaves a 
chaotic imprint. The play, outrageous for its time in Spain, is pure theater of 
the grotesque, stocked with such human flotsam as a beggar, a blind man and a 
dwarf in a rural Spanish setting in the late 1800s. Greed, lust and 
anti-clericalism underscore the work, but visiting Mexican director Xavier 
Rojas' farcical twists provide more noise than coherence. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion is that Rojas' alternating Spanish-language version is the 
production to see, if you know Spanish. In English, the tone is unremitting 
stridency. The grotesques become a splash of gargoyles without any ostensible 
purpose or discernible structure. 
</P>
<P>
The crumbling church walls of Estela Scarlata's vivid set design underscore the 
tension between Catholicism and sexuality, between actress Lori Street's 
prostitute-turned-angel and Tonyo Melendez's Satan/seducer. But this moral 
schism is mere garishness. Among the 12-member cast, Tamara DeTreaux's idiot 
dwarf child is the metaphor that most intrigues. 
</P>
<P>
 At 421 N. Avenue 19, Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., 
through Nov. 19. Tickets: $12; (213) 225-4044. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cowards' 
</P>
<P>
Does the Lee Strasberg Creative Center have a dramaturge? Isn't there anybody 
there who had the temerity to say that the romantic comedy "Cowards" didn't 
work because it's overlong by, say, nearly an hour? 
</P>
<P>
Director Laura J. Graham is a Sam Shepard scholar and maven. Maybe she brought 
too much Shepard to debuting playwright Samuel Klutznick's third-hand 
intimations of Noel Coward and Feydeau. 
</P>
<P>
And what's a solid actor like John Di Fusco doing in the tortuous marathon lead 
role? One can also cite Shannon Eubanks and John Lafleur's wasted efforts. 
Actually, they are all capable romantic-comedy players (supported by three 
other performers) plodding through a production that lacks pace, style, whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
The show, set in an East Coast island getaway, takes its relationship sagas 
rather seriously, when you're dying for champagne-cork-popping fun instead. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that the playwright's concept is fine, if derivative. But neither 
Klutznick nor Graham knows when to shut characters up, when to cut, to sail, to 
jib. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7936 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., through Nov. 
25. Tickets: $9-$12; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Is for...' 
</P>
<P>
The lack of economy also dogs the single-actor AIDS play, "A Is for . . ." at 
the Celebration Theatre, the only theater in L.A. committed exclusively to 
lesbian and gay productions. 
</P>
<P>
Written by and acted by Barry Vincent, the play traces nearly two years in the 
torment of a young white male who has tested positive as an HIV carrier. We see 
his uncertainty, we hear the painful calls to his obtuse mom, the dialogues 
with his lover, his frustration with his doctor over the alphabet soup of AIDS 
jargon. 
</P>
<P>
Can such a story ever be dated? Not in its essentials, but this production's 
unrelenting and ultimately repetitive litany of anger, melancholy and 
resignation is mournful to endure. Elements of humor and Vincent's brashness 
balance the production. What the show should scratch is its deflating 
intermission. And as is the custom with so much gay theater, the straight 
audience which would learn and benefit the most either isn't courted or doesn't 
come. 
</P>
<P>
Gay theater appears at a crossroads. Maybe the label itself is obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 At 426 N. Hoover St., Thursdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., through Nov. 5. 
Tickets: $10; (213) 876-4257. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sisyphus and Albert' 
</P>
<P>
"The laboring man of today," Albert Camus wrote, referring to Sisyphus' eternal 
chore, "works every day of his life at the same tasks, and that destiny is no 
less absurd." 
</P>
<P>
In "Sisyphus and Albert" at the Off Ramp Theatre, Camus finally gets to meet 
the legendary Corinthian, still pushing that boulder up the hill only to watch 
it fall; their conversation proves to Camus that his philosophical essay "The 
Myth of Sisyphus" is itself absurd. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, Sisyphus' task was actually fun. The damnation was loneliness. 
Oh, well, Camus can quickly run up a new theme on this variation. This sort of 
thing might work in the hands of a George Bernard Shaw, but author Lawrence 
O'Sullivan merely keeps pushing his script up the dramatic mountain only to see 
it roll back down when he isn't looking. 
</P>
<P>
Even the stalwart efforts of Alberto Isaac and a few effectively instrospective 
moments for Prince Hughes' Sisyphus have trouble surfacing through Les Wieder's 
simplistic direction of material which includes such pseudo-rap lyrics as, "Me 
and Mr. Rock are rollin' up this hill." 
</P>
<P>
At 1953 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 
p.m., until Nov. 5. Tickets: $10-$12; (213) 465-8059.

Sculptor Max DeMoss finally hits his stride with fragmented classical figures 
and equestrian statues that leap and gambol through space. The forms are 
beautiful, yet eerily incomplete. Cast in bronze, the forms are piecemeal 
constructions rife with mold lines and missing chunks of mass. This 
cut-and-paste treatment gives them the spontaneous appearance of quick gesture 
drawings done in three dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
As bodies break apart with the objectivity of a window dresser's mannequin, De 
Moss plays with the mystique of the bronze-casting process. He deconstructs 
some of its physical properties by flaying open the human and animal forms so 
that light and space can unravel the solid core. Mass is debunked as a hollow 
shell, and form is just a skin of shape jerked hastily over emptiness. With all 
that openness, light increasingly becomes an animating force solidifying within 
the dark interior. (Wenger Gallery, 828 N. La Brea Ave., to Oct. 24.).

Using paper gridded with lines R. Doen Toby fills hundreds of quarter-inch 
quadrants with small quick scribbles of conte, graphite or metallic pigment. 
From a distance, the works have a minimalist less-is-more elegance, along with 
the meditative rumblings of oriental calligraphy and color field abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Toby seems more a thinker than a paint pusher, as she views each mark 
as a diary entry concretizing a moment in time and space. One large horizontal 
piece has some 360 or so quadrants to represent each day in 1986. The shimmery 
uniformity of the little marks is broken up only by an occasional variation -- 
a small red square to indicate some out of the ordinary event, or a tiny black 
mark to log the death of an acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
Toby's works seem seeped in the crisis of figuration that spawned both 
conceptual and abstract art: how to convey intangibles like ideas, feelings, 
time, space, etc. without resorting to beleaguered literal depictions. However, 
this artist's solution is so whisper soft and personal that it fails to 
communicate with most of us.(Kiyo Higashi Gallery, 8332 Melrose to Nov. 9).

Joe Fay's combed color splotches have gone soft pastel. The color switch, 
coupled with his trademark cookie cutter silhouettes of cowboys, coyotes, 
leaping trout and bears makes for a weird, urban-sportsman's panache. It may be 
a move designed to confound intellectuals who like their art to look deadly 
serious, but it also knocks the pins from under pieces like "Bear and Bull 
Meadow" that try to a comment on the predator-prey relationship of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Fay's mood here is overwhelmingly exultant. It's so up-beat we're unsure 
whether he's praising or parodying the city slicker who spends holidays as an 
"environmentalist" trapper, hunter, or fisherman. Confusion reads like 
irresolution, which is too bad. Irony is a terrible thing to waste. 
</P>
<P>
Carm Goode's new, tiny expressionistic landscapes are dense, intensely 
conceptual paintings. As images they are juicy paintings of land and sea that 
play on the American landscape tradition, finding spiritual analogies in the 
beauty and desolation of nature. Explosions at sea, armored islands and 
hovering monoliths over figurative mesas suggest unsettling scenarios exuding a 
forbidding, philosophic fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
The titles, with their paragraph-long explanatory notes, put all that into 
technical terms. The text links the paintings to Rupert Sheldrake's radical 
theory of genetic memory, detailed definitions of form and fragments of Greek 
mythology. This complex content demands a great deal from the viewer. The 
payoff is something of a gut-level understanding of evolution as a self 
propelled act of God. Art used to expound theory is always in danger of being 
tagged illustrative or simply dull. Goode's paintings aren't dull, but they 
could never get all the philosophy across without the text. And that's where 
the ideas get piled so high they become didactic. (Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La 
Brea Ave., to Oct.28)SUVAN GEER

Leza Lidow loads her oils with deceivingly humorous and deliberately macabre 
images. In "Holding Court," a queen in a Marie Antoinette gown and tiara sports 
the head of a poodle. She struts regally in a semi circle of other female-dog 
hybrids whose nude bodies are perched on statuesque, furry legs. This rings of 
silly surrealism, but the thrust here is more disturbing than cute. Lidow uses 
the saturated, smoothly applied color, acute even focus and illogical Freudian 
concoctions of photo surrealism to lure us into nettlesome realizations about 
the female role through history. It is not simply perverse humor or an accident 
that Lidow makes "I Loathe Publicity," a visual parody and a verbal 
contradiction. The work depicts a dog headed baroness preening ridiculously for 
some unseen camera. The show's philosophical focal point is a triptych of a 
quaint cobblestone village dotted with clothes lines and romping children. 
Trapped inside the diaphanous drying laundry are the stiff, self conscious 
poses of nude women. Lidow would have done well to stop here. She also shows 
barely mediocre sculptures of paint splattered female mannequins that dilute 
her impact. (Ankrum Gallery, 657 La Cienega Blvd. to Nov. 11). MARLENA DONOHUE

'THE SAINT' FIRST UP ON THE MYSTERY WHEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Saint," in the stylish persona of Simon Templar, is back -- and KCOP's got 
him. The new face in the old role is likewise a Simon: suave Simon Dutton, a 
British actor whose paltry 31 years is enhanced with a few gray brush strokes 
across his temple hair. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13 runs the first of six new two-hour "Saint" episodes tonight at 8 in 
a Friday cycle labeled "The Mystery Wheel of Adventure." "The Saint" will share 
the slot with three Dick Francis tales about detective David Cleveland, as 
played by Ian McShane. The first Francis story goes on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The Saint was created in the 1920s by Leslie Charteris and went through various 
incantations in books, radio series, TV and film. Among the saintly casts have 
been George Sanders, Louis Hayward and Hugh Sinclair in the movies; Edgar 
Barrier, Brian Ahern, Vincent Price, Tom Conway (Sanders' brother) and Barry 
Sullivan on radio, and Roger Moore and Ian Ogilvy on the telly. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that the episode tonight, "The Brazilian Connection," about 
some byzantine baby selling ring, is unreasonably boring. If the producers were 
going for cool, they drifted over that deadly line that seperates style and 
dullness. 
</P>
<P>
Simon sees a baby being kidnaped and sets out to investigate. Turns out that 
16,000 babies were stolen in Brazil last year and sold off for 20,000 each or 
more.

Not a bad premise, and Dutton seems a reasonable choice for saintly duty. But 
he and his fellow players have nothing much to say or do in what is conversely 
a thin and bloated script. Even the generic music employed to pump excitement 
into a meaningless chase in the climax seems not to care. IRV LETOFSKY

'MANCUSO': LAST SHALL BE ONE OF THE WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The only redeemable component of last season's appalling NBC miniseries 
"Favorite Son" was Nick Mancuso, a surly FBI agent who somehow emerged from 
this tawdry production untainted and fit for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, "Mancuso FBI," airing at 10 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39. It's the 
last of the new fall series, and one of the worst, driving a potentially 
interesting character played by a good actor (Robert Loggia) into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't surprising, given that the co-executive producer of the spinoff is 
Steve Sohmer, who also created "Favorite Son" from his novel of the same name. 
And Sohmer's co-executive producer and the director of tonight's premiere is 
Jeff Bleckner, who also directed "Favorite Son." 
</P>
<P>
Their lack of restraint in "Favorite Son" carries over to "Mancuso FBI." 
</P>
<P>
When the secretary of a nominee for Secretary of Defense with a reputation for 
womanizing is discovered drowned in his pool, Mancuso is dispatched to 
investigate. By being easily snookered at almost every turn in the case, 
however, he immediately loses credibility as a character, substituting bombast 
and histrionics for intelligence. Not that an FBI agent has to be smart, only 
that this one is so unsmart -- and ready to jump to conclusions and make wild 
charges based on weak or no evidence -- that you wonder how he can still draw a 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso is less investigator than bully, a loud, frothing, coarse, insulting, 
obnoxious, one-man tornado whom Loggia revs up so high that you want to gag him 
and tell him to calm down. Seething is one thing, but director Bleckner lets 
Loggia roar out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the script by Sohmer and producer Ken Solarz is so preposterous that 
it approaches farce. "This country is precious to us, but it is no more 
precious than our marriage," the Cabinet nominee's wife tells Mancuso. Does 
anyone really speak that way? 
</P>
<P>
You do a double take when a TV reporter willingly gives Mancuso the name of a 
highly sensitive anonymous source. You do another when the reporter doesn't 
even wince when Mancuso confronts the source. And, finally, you do a third at 
the comically maudlin and inept ending. 
</P>
<P>
No more, please! Uncle! Uncle! HOWARD ROSENBERG

FESTIVAL PUTS CHILDREN'S PERFORMERS IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This weekend, the sprawling Peter Strauss Ranch in Agoura Hills will blossom 
with a colorful melange of canopies, balloons, musicians, dancers, actors, 
mimes, clowns and an array of eccentric, larger-than-life animal folk. 
</P>
<P>
It's an annual family event, the fifth Theatre Arts Festival for Youth -- Taffy 
for short -- presented in cooperation with the National Parks Service, which 
turns over about five of the park's 65 acres to the event. 
</P>
<P>
John and Pam Woods, as the performing duo J. P. Nightingale and perennial hosts 
of the Hollywood Bowl's Open House summer children's arts program, have been 
part of the youth theater scene for 17 years. The Canoga Park couple created 
the nonprofit Taffy festival five years ago to give a variety of children's 
performers a place to come together and provide family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 groups will perform at the two-day festival on three outdoor 
stages, one of which was added this year. Shows will last 20 to 40 minutes each 
and run continuously throughout the day. Last year, about 3,500 adults and 
children made the trip to the Lake Enchanto area park, contrasted with 800 five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The bill of fare includes old favorites such as singer/storytellers Dan Crow, 
Peter Alsop, Paul Tracey and We Tell Stories, a theater troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Talent new to the festival includes comic Angela Lloyd, singer/songwriters 
David Jack and Craig 'n Co., the Gospel Soul Messengers, Kids on the Block (not 
the rock group, but life-size puppets with physical handicaps), and Lois Young 
with her music and puppet show for preschoolers, called "Pancakes." 
</P>
<P>
Other performers are Viji, music and dance of India; Arco Iris, which performs 
South American folk music; Charles the Clown; the Aman Folk Ensemble; the Jim 
Gamble Marionettes; mimes Schwartz and Chung; Teatros de los Puppets; Judi 
Garrett, and Rhythms of the Village. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Baker, whose Baker Marionette Theatre has been popular in Los Angeles for 
more than 20 years, will also perform. He, along with puppeteer Betsy Brown and 
Marion Bartoo, creator of Poet Tree, will each receive a lifetime achievement 
award during the opening ceremonies. Five or six booths will offer crafts for 
sale, and there will be half a dozen workshops as well. Workshops include 
Michael Marks' Inflatable Art (a giant, air-filled structure that children 
crawl inside and color), hands-on musical activities, puppet-making, 
bead-stringing, book-making, kite-making, an arcade, a dunk tank and a Maypole. 
Some of the workshops charge between 25 and 50 cents for materials. 
</P>
<P>
Childrens Hospital will conduct its teddy bear clinic for the fifth year so 
children can bring in their bears or dolls for a checkup. 
</P>
<P>
The Taffy Town Players will portray animal characters who interact with 
festival-goers and maintain running plot lines throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the mythical people of Puddledumplin," a Victorian village circa 1850, 
said Garrett, who directs the troupe of professional actors who are taking part 
in the festival for the third year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's Taffy the Field Mouse -- she takes children on a treasure hunt. 
Portland Bill, the Salty Sea Dog, plays the recorder and tells stories. Lord 
and Lady Bacon will renew their wedding vows; we'll have a mock election for 
mayor and an open rehearsal for a wacky production of 'A Christmas Carol.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's more elaborate this year," Garrett said when asked about last year's 
sketchy Puddledumplin sets. "Last year we spent a lot of money on costumes; 
this year we spent it on sets." 
</P>
<P>
According to Wood, while the old sets were refurbished, this year's $1,000 set 
budget was spent primarily on the building of the festival's third stage. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect to see Disneyland, but we can't compete on that level," he said. 
"It's impossible to re-create a village when it has to be portable, so we tried 
to have the characters exemplify it more than the sets." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three months, makeup artist and actor Clayton Martinez has, with 
Chris Robbins, designed the Taffy Town Players' makeup, taking casts of actors' 
faces and coming up with characters that reflect illustrator Michael Rogers' 
Taffy designs. (The Taffy animal characters were created specifically for the 
festival.) 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who prefers doing fantasy makeup to science fiction and slasher 
makeup, said he particularly enjoyed doing a new character, the hedgehog, 
because "he's got sort of a Don King haircut." 
</P>
<P>
The refreshments are operated by Tree of Life, a program of the Valley Vineyard 
Christian Fellowship in Canoga Park. About 130 volunteers will operate the food 
stations, and the profits will help needy families in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically try to help people in a crisis," said Tree of Life Director Cindy 
Anderson. "Taffy is one of our major fund-raisers for the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
So that underprivileged children can attend the festival, the Woods have 
donated 1,000 tickets to organizations such as McLaren Hall, the Los Angeles 
County Department of Children's Services, the Free Arts Clinic in Malibu, the 
Toberman Settlement House in San Pedro and the Harvard Park Task Force in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Performers no longer have to volunteer their services as they did the first 
year. "They're now paid an honorarium, and we up it each year. We're trying to 
get close to their rate for a regular gig," John Woods said. This year, 
principal funding has come from a $3,000 Mervyns grant. Other sponsors include 
Prudential Insurance Co. and Longo Toyota of El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
"I always looked at this as a five-year pilot program," he said. "This year 
will tell the tale of where we need to go from here -- whether we'll add more 
weekends or move to a different location." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Peter Strauss Ranch (Lake Enchanto), 30000 Mulholland Highway, Agoura 
Hills, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are $8; $6 per person for 
seniors and groups of 10 or more; children under 3 free. Information: (818) 
998-8424.

LEMONGRASS PALACE IS THE NEW KID AMONG BLOCKS OF THAI RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One stretch of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City seems to have a Thai restaurant 
every few blocks. One of the newest is Lemongrass Palace, a large, clean-lined 
'50s sort of place done in white, gray and black with art hangings adding a 
splash of color. 
</P>
<P>
Among the pleasures at the Lemongrass are familiar dishes done especially well 
and unfamiliar dishes that convey the complex subtleties of Thai cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Lemongrass Palace's satay (skewered braised marinated beef), for instance, may 
seem simple, but it's not. The clear tangy taste is a compound of numerous 
flavors including ginger, garlic, chili, coriander, tumeric and cumin. It is 
served with a spiced peanut sauce, but the satay is so well-flavored and tender 
that the sauce risked gilding the lily. 
</P>
<P>
Larb was especially well-handled. Warm, coarsely ground beef shares the scene 
with crisp purple onions, scallions and carrots plus the welcome texture of 
rice powder, which helps spread the essential lime juice dressing. It's a salad 
that unites warm and cold, crispy and chewy -- a happy combination. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a mee krob fan, and use it as a bellwether of Thai cooking. Some versions 
of this airy mound of fried, thin rice noodles with shrimp, chicken, bean 
sprouts and scallions are unpleasantly sweet and tomatoey. This one was 
neither; the flavors were well-balanced and the chicken and shrimp tender and 
moist. Deep-fried won tons were, however, the usual thing. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising Tofu Delight was just that. Its hollowed-out rectangular blocks 
of soft tofu had been lightly fried to a chestnut brown and filled with a 
savory pork, shrimp and mushroom mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Exhilarating steam, rich in the perfume of chili, coconut and curry poured out 
when the waitress cut open the large foil puff that held the Mixed Seafood 
Special, a favorite dish. Inside were tender scallops, squid and green-shelled 
New Zealand mussels cooked in their own moisture. I could see pulling this 
package out of a charcoal fire and sharing it on a palm-tree-studded beach. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, there also have been disappointments at the Lemongrass Palace. Since they 
were mostly at lunch, it seems that there may be a different chef during the 
day. Pad gra-pow, chicken sauteed with chili, onion and fresh mint, was almost 
bereft of the mint, which gives this dish its character. 
</P>
<P>
Prig khing (which in its various spellings has always struck me as seditiously 
anti-monarchist) consists of leaves of beef -- or pork or chicken -- with green 
beans in a dark curry sauce. The beans were crunchy, as they should be, but the 
beef was far too tough. The only dish that didn't work at dinner was the 
Lemongrass Duckling, which was dry and, strangely, lacked duck flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The Lemongrass Palace is reasonably priced, and the staff is graciously 
attentive. Being greeted upon arrival and escorted to the door upon leaving is 
a nice gesture. It makes you feel that even though they don't know you, you are 
the guest of people who are proud of their hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: Satay, $7; Tofu Delight, $6; Green Curry, $7; Mixed Seafood 
Special, $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemongrass Palace, 11744 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 985-7491. Open 11 
a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Beer and wine license pending. Parking lot. Dinner 
for two, food only, $30-$45. Major credit cards accepted.

U.S. PLANNING BETTER CRISIS MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bush Administration officials, embarrassed at the disarray that marred their 
response to the Panamanian coup attempt, are planning to reform the 
government's crisis management system and to take more "aggressive" action 
against Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega in the future, sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An internal White House investigation has concluded that the sluggish response 
to the armed rebellion was partly caused by operational and communications 
foul-ups, according to a source familiar with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Although this source said the problems can be fairly easily corrected, other 
sources called the communications flaws much more serious. Officials responding 
to the crisis were "like the five blind guys trying to feel the elephant," one 
Bush adviser said. "They didn't know whether they had hold of the trunk or the 
tail." 
</P>
<P>
Even more significant than any flaws and proposed reforms in White House crisis 
management, however, may be the new, more militant anti-Noriega attitude that 
has spread through the Administration in the wake of the failure of the Oct. 3 
attempted coup. U.S. officials were described as "angry and frustrated" at the 
way Noriega outwitted his captors and emerged unscathed and more belligerent 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the coup amid evidence of Administration confusion and lack of 
decisiveness was especially galling because President Bush had advocated just 
such efforts by the Panama Defense Forces to oust Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"The planning now is for more aggressive action. The word is going out to be 
more aggressive," a senior government official said. 
</P>
<P>
While declining to elaborate on what he meant by "aggressive action" or to 
discuss options available to the United States, the official said: "Noriega's 
not out of the woods. He's into heavy paranoia, wondering who else was in on 
the plot. And we can make him a lot more paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
In case another attempt is made to overthrow Noriega, one possible option for 
Bush would be to implement what some officials call "the President's snatch 
authority" -- a secret ruling last June 21 by the Justice Department's office 
of legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Sources told The Times that the legal opinion, which was issued in strictest 
secrecy and has never been released publicly, provides that the President can 
authorize the FBI to apprehend fugitives from U.S. law in foreign lands and 
return them to this country without the foreign government's consent, even if 
the action violates international law. 
</P>
<P>
Dating back to Feb. 4, 1988, when federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa, 
Fla., indicted Noriega on drug trafficking and related charges, the United 
States has sought to drive him from power and, if possible, bring him to this 
country for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Kidnaping a foreign leader would violate international law, but the Justice 
Department's "snatch" ruling apparently could be invoked as a legal weapon to 
seize and return to U.S. jurisdiction a foreign leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The snatch option is a prerogative for the President to consider in trying to 
remove Noriega," an intelligence official said. He indicated that the 
Administration never seriously considered taking that action during the Oct. 3 
coup attempt because it would have required direct military intervention and 
Bush wanted to keep "a low military profile." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration, which has been severely criticized by Republicans and 
Democrats on Capitol Hill for failing to assist the Panamanian coup leaders, 
might be tempted to invoke the Justice Department ruling in the event of 
another attempt by rebels to overthrow Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably not going to be the coolest of heads for a while," said one 
Administration official, who added that he hopes time will calm emotions 
because "some are angry and feeling that we've been had." 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, too, there was concern that in the event of another coup 
attempt Administration officials -- still smarting from criticism that they had 
let an opportunity to topple Noriega slip away -- might feel under pressure to 
act quickly and end up doing something rash. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they don't overreact and do something dumb," said Rep. Dave McCurdy 
(D-Okla.), a leading member of the House Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
McCurdy, who last week charged that the failed coup had reinforced "the wimp 
factor" that dogged Bush throughout last year's presidential campaign, said the 
Administration may never have as good a chance to oust Noriega as it had last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities are not going to present themselves in a similar way," he 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns that the Administration may act precipitously if there is a 
next time, Bush has a well-earned reputation for being cautious. 
</P>
<P>
And the President's top national security advisers -- Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney and CIA Director William H. Webster -- also are well known as cautious 
leaders who are more apt to opt for inaction rather than run the risk of a 
serious setback in a crisis situation. (Webster was in Europe on a long-planned 
visit during the coup attempt.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, "imperiling American troops is something that weighs heavily on the 
President's mind," said one of his top advisers. 
</P>
<P>
During the coup, U.S. troops in Panama acted to support the rebels by blocking 
some roads near American facilities that Noriega loyalists might have used to 
attack the coup plotters. But other avenues of transportation, particularly 
airfields, were not blocked and the coup was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the White House insisted that the U.S. troops had been deployed as 
part of a previously scheduled exercise and Bush publicly disclaimed 
significant U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, after it was learned that the United States had advance 
knowledge of the plot against Noriega, the White House acknowledged that the 
deployments had been authorized to help the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the coup attempt, Bush's national security advisers have been 
conducting what one official called "lessons learned" sessions where they have 
gone over details of the Administration's response and tried to pinpoint 
shortcomings in the crisis management system. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials refused to comment on the record about their findings, a 
report on the internal White House investigation is expected to be presented to 
the President within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
An official familiar with the findings thus far insisted that there was no 
failure of U.S. intelligence, that only "relatively minor" flaws were 
discovered in the response system and that any reforms can be easily 
implemented by the agencies involved. He indicated that those conclusions will 
be set forth in the report to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
However, other officials said that intelligence was inadequate and that there 
were significant flaws in the response system, including a serious lack of 
coordination among various agencies collecting intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
For example, intelligence collected by the U.S. Southern Command in Panama 
frequently was fed to the White House through the Pentagon without being 
supplied to other agencies involved the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officials insisted that they sent enough information to Washington 
to permit a considered official response to the coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
One intelligence source said that while the CIA is not under pressure from 
Capitol Hill as a result of providing inadequate data, some people there are 
now "circling the wagons," looking for a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources confirmed that the White House was supplied with 
information about the coup attempt 29 hours before it occurred, but one 
official said: "We don't know how the people there focused on what was being 
conveyed to them or how serious they thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
The intelligence agencies themselves approached the planned coup with great 
skepticism, according to another official, who said: "The coup plan didn't 
sound like it was going anywhere from the beginning, and we conveyed that to 
the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bush nor his top national security advisers in Washington at the time 
-- Baker, Scowcroft and Cheney -- considered the original information about the 
coup attempt serious enough to interrupt their personal schedules and go to the 
White House "situation room," where officials generally gather to assess 
intelligence and direct the Administration's response to an international 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that two of the things they've learned from all this," said a 
close Bush adviser, "are that you've got to recognize a crisis when there is 
one, and you've got to be willing to interrupt your personal schedule and deal 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Keeping personal schedules is not the beat-all, end-all of governing, and they 
are all big on that, on keeping their meetings on schedule. Somebody, somehow 
-- Scowcroft or somebody -- has got to say, 'Wait a minute, we've got to have a 
meeting.' You've got to say, 'Here's a crisis,' and get all the players 
involved. They can't work together if they're not together."

ARMY COLLAPSE REPORTEDLY CRIPPLES ETHIOPIAN REGIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ethiopian army, the largest fighting force in sub-Saharan Africa, has 
collapsed in chaos, crippling the 12-year-old Marxist regime of President 
Mengistu Haile Mariam, local and Western specialists here say. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four weeks, the 300,000-member army has been battered by a much 
smaller force of rebels from the Tigre People's Liberation Front, one of two 
major guerrilla bands operating in the north of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigre Front has swept to within 150 miles of the capital, Addis Ababa, 
threatening a main supply road linking the capital to the Red Sea port of 
Assab. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the front has torn apart some of the army's best-trained units 
as well as regiments of untrained boys dragooned into the service in a brutal 
conscription drive last April. 
</P>
<P>
The military reversals come at a time when the Mengistu regime faces its most 
serious political and economic crisis since the famine of 1984-85. Public 
disaffection with the inept government is higher than at any time since top 
military officers attempted a coup in May, and diplomats here say there has 
been at least one attempt on the president's life in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government, since 1974 Mengistu's main supplier of military aid and 
materiel, has told the government that it may not renew the arms supply 
agreement that is scheduled to expire in 1991. Although the Soviets are not 
thought likely to abandon Africa's only Leninist regime, in which they have 
invested as much as $10 billion in military aid over the past decade or so, 
they are known to have urged Mengistu to settle the northern wars. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crops have failed again in northern Ethiopia, meaning that as many 
as 1.7 million people will face starvation without substantial food aid from 
Western donors. And this summer's collapse of the worldwide price of coffee, 
Ethiopia's main export, has cut foreign exchange earnings by as much as 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"There really are a lot of signs that the Mengistu regime is coming apart at 
the seams," a Western diplomatic source in Addis Ababa said recently. "It's not 
just the usual crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of the army is a key development because the military is the 
strongest -- some might say the only -- base of support for the regime. It was 
the army that deposed the aged Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 in Africa's only 
avowedly Marxist-Leninist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The government was taken over by a secretive military body known as the Dergue, 
or committee. Mengistu emerged as the most influential member of this group in 
1975 and consolidated his rule after a 1977 shoot-out at Dergue headquarters 
that took the lives of six other members. 
</P>
<P>
There is little support now for the personally uninspiring Mengistu in other 
traditional power centers in the country, and virtually no taste for the 
government's discredited Marxist ideology, according to observers here. 
</P>
<P>
The peasantry, which accounts for 90% of the population, is increasingly 
unhappy with a restrictive and impoverishing agricultural policy that has 
reduced grain production by more than 20% in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny group of small businessmen and traders is passive, and the bureaucracy 
-- one of the best-trained, technically adept and reform-minded in Africa -- is 
frustrated by the need to await policy decisions from the secretive Dergue. 
</P>
<P>
As for the army, at least one East Bloc source in Addis Ababa estimated that it 
has lost as many as 60,000 men -- killed, wounded or deserted -- in fighting 
the Tigre Front since January. That is more than the nearly 50,000 men the 
United States lost in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The army's defeats came from an unexpected quarter. The Tigre Front, which 
since February has controlled most of Tigre province, has generally been 
considered the lesser of two main northern guerrilla forces. The other is the 
larger, better-equipped and more sophisticated Eritrean Peoples Liberation 
Front. Both movements are nominally Marxist, but the main EPLF goal is an 
independent Eritrea, and the TPLF's only consistent demand has been for the 
removal of Mengistu. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of September, the TPLF swept out of Tigre and into neighboring 
Wollo province, acquiring adherents and tons of hastily abandoned arms and 
equipment along the way. In a series of battles, the front destroyed some of 
the army's best units, including the 101st Division, which had been moved to 
the front after putting down the coup attempt in the Eritrean city of Asmara. 
</P>
<P>
Western analysts in Addis Ababa believe there are several reasons for the 
collapse of the army. One is the erosion of the army's leadership. After the 
attempted coup, Mengistu removed scores of top officers, including many of the 
last of those trained by Americans before the 1974 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they were replaced with known loyalists, however inadequate 
their military skills. For example, the head of the 1st Army, headquartered in 
the city of Harar, was replaced by the head of the Relief and Rehabilitation 
Commission, who is related to Mengistu by marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is the low morale and poor training of thousands of soldiers. 
Many of them were drafted in the vicious April conscription campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"You're sweeping the streets of 12- and 13-year-olds," a Western diplomat 
observed. "Obviously they're not going to turn in an impressive showing." 
</P>
<P>
Once word got around that the Tigre Front would not take prisoners but would 
simply disarm captured soldiers and send them home, the government units began 
to surrender at the first sign of trouble, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids know that if they just stand up and surrender when the thing 
starts, they probably won't get shot,"' one well-informed observer said. 
</P>
<P>
A Western relief official who visited Wollo during the campaign said he came 
upon one hapless group of 700 young soldiers waiting out a rainstorm in a 
field, deprived by the rebels of their weapons and boots. 
</P>
<P>
The April draft created another major problem for Mengistu: an explosion of 
public enmity. 
</P>
<P>
Even government officials were hiding their 11- and 12-year-old sons in cellars 
to keep them away from press gangs roving the cities and countryside, 
surrounding schools and bars and dragging teen-agers away. A European diplomat 
said that during this period, he saw a convoy of 96 buses on a road south of 
Addis Ababa loaded with young conscripts. 
</P>
<P>
Many people here believe that the draft directly contributed to the timing of 
the coup attempt, since the plotters reasoned that support for the regime would 
be close to non-existent. The plotters moved on Mengistu's palace and the 
Ministry of Defense in May, while the president was on a visit to East Germany, 
but they were foiled by members of Mengistu's 3,000-strong palace guard. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Mengistu has implemented some modest -- petty, according to some -- 
social reforms, evidently hoping to ease public disaffection. A four-year ban 
on Sunday driving was lifted, along with the rationing of gasoline, although 
gas prices were raised. Civil servants are no longer required to wear their 
customary light blue uniforms, which resemble leisure suits. 
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the regime may soon lift a ban on the construction 
of private housing. Many here predict that this would lead to an explosion in 
construction of lucrative rental mansions for diplomats and international 
bureaucrats in Addis Ababa, the home of Africa's largest diplomatic community. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, in August the government entered into peace talks with 
the Eritrean Front in an apparent attempt to end the 28-year-old war in 
Eritrea. The talks, which opened in Atlanta under the sponsorship of former 
President Jimmy Carter, are scheduled to resume Nov. 18 in Nairobi. This week, 
Mengistu repeated a pledge he last made before the Tigrean offensive, to seek 
peace talks with the TPLF as well. The TPLF said no such talks are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign observers in the Ethiopian capital are preoccupied with 
drawing up scenarios for the ultimate collapse of the Mengistu regime. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, Mengistu is running the control room at Three Mile Island," a 
Western diplomat said, referring to the nuclear accident that occurred in 1979 
at the nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
If the Tigre Front cuts the vulnerable Assab-Addis Ababa supply road, for 
example, the capital will fall, although the TPLF is thought to be stretched 
very thin after its monthlong string of victories. 
</P>
<P>
Others are awaiting an offensive by the stronger Eritrean Peoples Liberation 
Front, which has not been active militarily since 1988. Any significant move by 
that force, they think, would probably result in the disintegration of the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
A third possibility, analysts say, is another coup attempt. The most positive 
potential outcome of that would be the installation of a military leadership 
that would sue for peace in the north. Although anarchy could reign in Ethiopia 
after a coup, most observers here speculate that new leadership would retain 
the skilled bureaucracy to run the government and economy, much as the Dergue 
did after the overthrow of the imperial government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, amid widespread unemployment, inflation and famine in Ethiopia, a 
secretive army group known as the Dergue overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 
Africa's only avowedly Marxist-Leninist revolution. A year later, Mengistu 
Haile Mariam emerged as leader of the group. He consolidated his rule in 1977 
after a shoot-out at Dergue headquarters. Haile Selassie, placed under house 
arrest, died in Addis Ababa in 1975 at the age of 83.

4 AMERICANS, GERMAN SHARE SCIENCE NOBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two American molecular biologists who revolutionized scientists' view of the 
nature of the first life on Earth won the Nobel Prize for chemistry on 
Thursday, while two Americans and a German physicist who developed new 
techniques for highly accurate timekeeping shared the physics Nobel. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado in Boulder and Sidney Altman of Yale 
University will share the $460,000 chemistry prize for their unexpected 
discovery that ribonucleic acid (RNA), which was originally thought only to be 
a repository of genetic information, can carry out biochemical functions as 
well. The discovery may make possible new ways to fight the common cold and 
other viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Ramsey of Harvard University will receive half the physics prize for his 
discovery of the atomic clock, which utilized the element cesium to make modern 
timekeeping possible and, in the process, helped develop a firm underpinning 
for relativity, one of the most esoteric theories in physics. 
</P>
<P>
Hans G. Dehmelt of the University of Washington in Seattle and Wolfgang Paul of 
the University of Bonn in West Germany shared the other half for their 
development of techniques for trapping charged particles for long periods of 
time, which is expected to lead to the development of clocks that are many 
times more accurate than even the cesium clocks. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements completed a near-sweep of the science Nobels by U.S. 
researchers this year, continuing U.S. dominance of the prizes. On Monday, 
cancer researchers Harold E. Varmus and J. Michael Bishop of UC San Francisco 
were named winners of the medicine Nobel, making six of the seven recipients 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
All the new laureates expressed surprise and delight upon their early morning 
notification of the awards. "I would not say I expected it," Dehmelt said, "but 
I may have hoped or wished for it." 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that everyone has been telling me would happen," Cech said, 
"but I had no way of knowing when." 
</P>
<P>
At a morning celebratory party at Harvard, Ramsey poured champagne for two 
previous Harvard Nobel laureates and, before pouring his own glass, paused and 
said: "Well, my day is probably shot anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his plans for the prize money, Dehmelt said: "I will spend it." 
</P>
<P>
Cech, 41, and Altman, 50, helped evolutionary biologists attack an age-old 
puzzle that is often stated in terms of the riddle, "Which came first, the 
chicken or the egg?" In this case, the "egg" is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), 
the genetic blueprint that stores all the information from which organisms are 
constructed, while the "chickens" are proteins, which carry out all biochemical 
functions in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists reasoned that the first life on Earth had to have both genetic 
information and biochemical functions, implying that both DNA and proteins must 
have been present when the first life arose from the primordial ooze. But 
virtually everyone agrees that a system containing both DNA and proteins is too 
complex to have arisen spontaneously, leaving researchers at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Cech and Altman, working independently, solved the problem by focusing on RNA, 
which until that time had been considered only a simple messenger -- in effect, 
a set of working blueprints, copied from the master blueprint of DNA, that 
serve as a pattern for the construction of proteins. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Canadian-born Altman was studying an RNA-cutting protein from a 
bacterium when he found that RNA fragments were necessary for the activity of 
the protein. Altman himself had difficulty believing his results and even 
greater difficulty publishing them. Funding agencies were also highly skeptical 
about his claims. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1981, Cech, who received his doctorate from UC Berkeley, demonstrated 
that the cutting and splicing of RNA from a single-celled protozoan could be 
carried out in the absence of proteins. He and Altman subsequently showed that 
RNA could take the place of proteins called enzymes in carrying out many 
chemical reactions, opening a floodgate of new research on RNA. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers also believe that the concept of RNA enzymes will have even 
greater importance in the future because they might be used to destroy viruses 
or to remove the genetic information that makes them harmful, leading to new 
treatments for disease. 
</P>
<P>
Although not as old as the origin of life, the problem of keeping time has 
plagued humans for eons. From the beginning of time until 1967, timekeeping 
methods were based on the rotation of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In that year, the world switched to a newer form of timekeeping based on the 
oscillations of cesium atoms in a so-called atomic clock. That clock was 
largely the work of Ramsey, 74. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, Ramsey found a way to measure the frequency with which cesium 
atoms, flying through a cavity, switch between two electronically excited 
states. Since 1967, one second has been defined internationally as the time 
required for 9,192,631,770 such oscillations. 
</P>
<P>
The chief advantage of the atomic clock is that it is accurate to one second in 
300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
Precise timekeeping is crucial in a variety of modern applications. In 
satellite-based navigation systems, for example, the time required for a radio 
signal to travel to a ship or plane from satellites can be used to determine 
position precisely, but only if the timekeeping is accurate. Deep space 
communications also require extremely stable frequencies such as those produced 
by atomic clocks. 
</P>
<P>
The new clocks have also been crucial in confirming Einstein's Theory of 
General Relativity, which predicts, among other things, that time passes faster 
when gravity is lower, but more slowly for objects traveling at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
But the differences are so small that high accuracy is required. In one 
experiment, for example, a cesium clock was carried in an airplane flying at 
30,000 feet for 15 hours. When the plane landed, the clock had gained about 45 
billionths of a second, confirming the theory. 
</P>
<P>
But the accuracy of atomic clocks is limited by the necessity of measuring the 
oscillations of the fast-moving cesium atoms, a problem akin to taking a clear 
photograph of a speeding bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Dehmelt, a naturalized citizen born in Germany, and Paul, 76, 
devised techniques for trapping single cesium ions (atoms from which an 
electron has been stripped away) or other charged particles in magnetic fields 
for long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
Using these techniques, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology, the nation's official timekeeper, are now developing clocks that 
are 100,000 times as accurate as existing cesium clocks.

COMPUTER VIRUSES -- IS THE THREAT AS REAL AS HYPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rumors started vibrating in late August: A new electronic virus, capable of 
crippling the operations of millions of personal computers, had been unleashed 
in Europe and was triggered to begin exploding throughout the United States on 
Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
By early September, "virus busters" across the nation were mobilized. 
</P>
<P>
The alarm was sounded by a young, energetic computer security officer in 
Washington, who persuaded a Nashville computer engineer, well connected in 
"hacker" circles, to create an antidote that was tested on a sample of the 
virus held by a retired computer science professor from Long Island. Their 
efforts worked. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the virus -- alternately known as "Friday the 13th" or "Data Crime" 
-- was set to detonate today, thousands of anxious PC owners from Augusta to 
Anaheim were able to check their systems for the infection and prevent the 
possible loss of vital information. 
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented effort, the first of such nationwide proportions, has 
provided a big boost for the virus detection industry, a loose but fast-growing 
fraternity of self-styled detectives, reformed hackers and righteous computer 
engineers out to eradicate the pernicious electronic critters -- and turn a 
buck for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But, at the same time, the episode has set off a fierce debate about the true 
severity of this and other virus threats, and whether such intense exposure 
generates hysteria and preys on computer owners' insecurities, luring them into 
buying expensive -- and possibly unneeded -- computer security systems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a media virus, not a computer virus," bellows John McAfee, director 
of the 2-year-old Computer Virus Industry Assn. in Santa Clara and an outspoken 
critic of the current flurry of anti-virus efforts. "There won't be anything 
happening (today). We have a phantom here." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. According to Dennis Steinauer, manager of computer security management 
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington, the 
much-dreaded Friday the 13th virus was discovered in only about a dozen PCs in 
the weeks before it was set to explode. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic viruses are software programs that are deliberately appended to 
legitimate software. Their key characteristic is that they are capable of 
reproducing themselves endlessly, either through computer networks or the 
innocent sharing of infected data disks among PC users. 
</P>
<P>
Viruses can spread good cheer -- one wished startled PC users at International 
Business Machines a Merry Christmas -- but most inflict damage by destroying 
data or clogging a machine's operations to the point of near overload. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday the 13th strain, one of at least three similar infections created by 
rogue computer hackers in Northern Europe earlier this year, is considered 
particularly pernicious because it can wipe out the instructions governing how 
information is stored on the hard disks of certain PC models, rendering their 
contents completely inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
The virus was aimed at IBM personal computers and compatible models, the most 
popular of all PC systems, putting an estimated 25 million to 30 million 
machines potentially at risk. 
</P>
<P>
However, most experts now agree that the threat was greater that the true 
impact. "The bottom line is that it appears to have been blown totally out of 
proportion," Steinauer says. "It has driven people over the edge." 
</P>
<P>
It also, apparently, has driven customers into the arms of waiting salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Computer security officials tell of being peppered over the last several weeks 
with brochures offering virus screening programs, antidotes, vaccines and other 
infection-fighting systems. Several claimed to work against Friday the 13th, 
while others just mentioned the current threat as evidence that no personal 
computer could be considered immune from infection without its owner having 
taken the proper precautions. Prices ranged from nothing to hundreds of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like people who sell burglar alarm systems coming to your door with 
pictures of ransacked houses and families that have been devastated," complains 
McAfee, who himself sells several computer security systems. "Of course, this 
is a legitimate business for a legitimate problem, but like anything else, 
there have been abuses." 
</P>
<P>
Though highly visible these days, the virus-busting portion of the large and 
well-established computer security industry is still quite new, and small. But 
it is growing. And so, too, are its supposed targets. 
</P>
<P>
According to McAfee, reports of virus infections to his institute are currently 
running at the rate of 10,000 per month, nearly twice that of 1988. He says 10 
new strains were discovered in the last two months, three alone in just the 
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-viral programs, which go by such colorful names as "Data Physician," 
"Flushot," "Interferon" and "Disk Defender," first showed up on the market 
about three years ago. Ranging in price from "free for the asking" to upward of 
$500, these products can, in their most elementary form, detect the presence of 
a virus, and, at their most sophisticated, automatically contain and disarm it. 
</P>
<P>
But although the number of available products has increased to nearly two dozen 
-- including an entry just two weeks ago from IBM -- industry experts estimate 
that total sales are still considerably under $20 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
The first tip about the latest infection apparently came from an anonymous oil 
company security officer working in Northern Europe who reportedly heard that 
the virus was being shipped to the United States. He is said to have told a 
friend, Tom Patterson, a 30-year-old computer security officer for Centel 
Federal Systems in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson, who claims a background as a government intelligence operative, 
alerted the media and then turned to Winn Schwartau, a Nashville computer 
software engineer, for a quick antidote for Centel's customers. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartau says he leaned on his sources in the computer hacker underground for 
the code to the virus, and ultimately tested his detection program on a copy of 
the virus held by Harold J. Highland, a retired computer science professor who 
publishes Computers &amp; Security, a respected industry journal, from his home 
in Elmont, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
According to Schwartau, at least 50,000 copies of his antidote, at about $25 a 
piece, have been sold in the last week. Countless copies of similar programs, 
some at considerably higher prices, were sold by other companies, some newly 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
Early entrants into the field worry that the current flap will give their 
fledgling business a bad name. "A lot of companies are trying to capitalize on 
the virus hysteria," says Michael Riemer, president of Foundation Ware, a 
4-year-old Cleveland computer security firm. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Riemer's biggest concern is that computer users will mistakenly believe 
that because they have purchased one anti-viral product they are forever immune 
to all electronic infections, an error equivalent to believing that inoculation 
against the swine flu will protect against an invasion of the Hong Kong 
variety. Without a comprehensive security program and repeated checkups, Riemer 
says, no system is out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
Others worry that vaccines and antidotes just egg on renegade programmers. 
"These anti-virus efforts just pose a challenge to these programmers to dream 
up yet another virus that will be undetectable," says Donn Parker, a computer 
security expert at SRI, a Menlo Park think-tank. "And they'll do it. That's the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Parker's solution is to stop talking about viruses as though they were the 
electronic equivalent of nuclear holocaust. "This virus problem is serious only 
because of the potential losses, not the actual ones," he says. "This whole 
episode has been like the scares of the 1960s when we all thought the hippies 
would put LSD in the nation's water supplies." 
</P>
<P>
To Schwartau, the Nashville engineer, such notions are the equivalent of 
ignoring AIDS because it has infected a small percentage of the world's total 
population. "That's nuts, and you know it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he admits that things did get a little out of hand these last few weeks. 
"Did it become a media event?" Schwartau repeats. "Well, sort of. But it has 
focused corporate America on the problem of computer viruses." 
</P>
<P>
Adds the government's Steinauer: "If this has done nothing more than get people 
to back up their computer disks, which they probably haven't done since they 
bought the machines, then it's not a half-bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Although the first electronic viruses were discovered nearly two decades ago, 
these infectious software programs have gained momentum and attention recently 
because the proliferation of personal computers and computer networks makes 
their creation and transmission far easier than in the past. There are no 
completely foolproof ways to avoid infection; the simplest precautions a PC 
user can take are to carefully screen incoming data and routinely make copies 
of all stored information.

WATER BOARD EXPECTED TO ORDER CLOSING OF TOXIC DUMP FACING $6.2-MILLION FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Regional Water Quality Control Board is expected to approve a 
proposal today that will shut down the landfills at Casmalia Resources, one of 
two toxic waste dumps in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently had ordered Casmalia to close 
most operations by Oct. 28 and proposed a $6.2-million fine against the dump 
for accepting more waste than it was authorized to handle. EPA officials say 
that the landfill's owners could appeal both the fine and the closure order and 
stay open long beyond the mandated closing date. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal before the state water board to prohibit the site from 
accepting regular toxic waste shipments after Nov. 26 cannot be appealed. Water 
board officials say they expect the proposal to be passed, largely because 
legislation mandates that the dump be closed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Legislature ordered that toxic landfills that did not meet 
stricter new standards would be effectively prohibited from accepting toxic 
materials in five years. Next month, Casmalia's five years are up. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County officials have been critical of the water board for 
waiting until the last day of the five-year period to take action. 
</P>
<P>
"They've waited until the 12th chime of the clock before doing anything," said 
Mary Ann Scott, a hazardous waste specialist for the county. "This should have 
been looked at years ago, especially considering the history of alleged health 
violations as a result of the dump." 
</P>
<P>
While the four landfills at Casmalia will soon be shut down, this does not mean 
that Casmalia Resources is out of business. The EPA has announced a 
controversial decision to grant draft permits for two new toxic landfills at 
the site. The owners of the dump have applied to build two large landfills and 
five "evaporation" ponds to treat contaminated ground water and other toxic 
liquids. But their proposal must first complete the lengthy local, state and 
federal approval process. 
</P>
<P>
And after Nov. 26, the water board will still allow the dump to accept about 20 
truckloads of waste a month for the specific purpose of drying up seepage under 
the landfills. The water board will give Casmalia one year to complete this 
process and then will not allow any more waste to be brought to the site. The 
county and Casmalia now are involved in litigation over this controversial 
cleanup method. 
</P>
<P>
The water board waited until now to order the closure of Casmalia because 
"coordinating all the closure requirements" is a time-consuming process, said 
Eric Gobler, a senior engineer for the water board. 
</P>
<P>
"I sympathize with some of the frustration," he said. "But people should also 
realize there's only a few places in the state to dispose of hazardous waste. 
If we closed all those areas, this state would be in a world of hurt." The only 
other toxic dump in Southern California is at Kettleman City in Kings County. 
</P>
<P>
The water board also was under criticism earlier this year for fining Casmalia 
only $130,000 for contaminating ground water outside the boundaries of the 
dump. The board had the authority to fine the owners of the dump up to $1.45 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the small town of Casmalia, about 70 miles north of Santa Barbara, 
claim there have been extensive health problems in the community because of the 
dump. Many say they are outraged that the dump has received draft permits for 
more landfills and plan to turn out in force when the EPA holds a public 
hearing Nov. 8 in Santa Maria on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The government gives them a $6-million fine and at the same time gives them 
the permit to expand the dump. What a joke," said Nick Irmiter, a longtime 
Casmalia resident. "After all the medical problems we've had and all the 
violations at the dump . . . the whole thing is criminal." 
</P>
<P>
But EPA spokesman Al Zemsky said the proposed $6.2-million fine and the permit 
for Casmalia's expansion "are unrelated." Casmalia applied for the permit and 
the EPA is "obligated by law to accept the application, regardless of the 
history of the facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fine, subject to revision depending on further information about Casmalia's 
profits, was the largest ever imposed under federal toxic waste disposal laws. 
The EPA charged that Casmalia violated the law by accepting too much waste and 
improperly expanding its landfills. Casmalia has until the end of the month to 
respond to the proposed penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Casmalia Resources did not return numerous phone messages left at 
their Montecito headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Casmalia officials had long maintained that the landfill was one of the safest 
in the country because an "impermeable" natural clay vault prevented 
contamination of ground water. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last year, ground water contamination has been detected in four 
areas outside the boundaries of the dump. Many residents now fear that even if 
local or state authorities block Casmalia from building new landfills, the 
existing contamination will continue to plague the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Years after the dump is closed, the contamination's going to be causing 
serious problems," said Hugh Hanna, a member of Casmalia Community Advisory 
Committee. "If this contamination starts seeping into the water basin you're 
going to see massive health problems." 
</P>
<P>
But water board officials said they do not believe off-site contamination will 
seep into the area's water basin because water beneath the site is flowing to 
the south, away from the area's drinking water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The town of Casmalia has a population of only 175, but since 1982, 15 residents 
have died, three have contracted rare blood diseases and there have been three 
stillborn births and five miscarriages, according to Kenneth McCalip, principal 
of Casmalia School and unofficial toxic waste spokesman for the town. 
</P>
<P>
A recent county-commissioned medical study conducted by nine doctors could not 
definitively link the serious health problems among residents to the dump. But 
the study concluded that the dump could pose long-term health hazards to 
residents, and five of the nine doctors endorsed closure of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"While the commission could not confirm an imminent . . . substantial 
endangerment to health, that by no means implies a clean bill of health for 
operation of the facility," the report said. "The major adverse effects might 
not manifest themselves for decades." 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the commission did not have access to their medical records so it 
could not accurately assess the health problems caused by the dump. A number of 
residents have filed a class-action lawsuit against Casmalia Resources, the 
state and county, and they have been advised by their attorneys not to turn 
over medical records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Casmalia Resources, one of two toxic waste dumps in Southern California, opened 
in 1972. The dump has been beset by controversy for years, and many residents 
of the nearby town claim they have suffered serious health problems because of 
the facility. The dump will soon be prohibited from accepting regular shipments 
of toxic waste, state officials say. But Casmalia already has applied for 
permits to open new landfills.

BISHOPS' PANEL REJECTS CONDOMS IN AIDS BATTLE 
</P>

<P>
Countering a controversial earlier position, a committee of Roman Catholic 
bishops Thursday issued a draft of a new policy paper on the AIDS crisis that 
strongly rejects any use of condoms to prevent the spread of the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
The document, which claims that sexual abstinence outside marriage is the only 
moral and practical solution, also condemns programs in which sterile needles 
are dispersed to drug addicts to lessen the risk of infection by sharing 
contaminated ones. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, who chairs the five-member committee, 
was one of several bishops who had objected to the earlier statement that gave 
implicit permission to church hospitals and agencies to provide information on 
condoms as a potential safeguard against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony called the first statement "terribly confusing" to Catholics. 
Compromising on Catholic teaching in order to be more influential in public 
policy "has never been our role. Even to start down that road is fraught with 
difficulties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first statement was approved by the U.S. bishops' 50-member 
administrative board in December, 1987, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the 
Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, joined in the criticism and 
admonished the U.S. bishops for not consulting with Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, adapting the statement for his own archdiocese, revised five sentences 
to flatly prohibit the endorsement of public health recommendations on condoms. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 300 bishops reached a compromise at a June, 1988, national meeting 
by letting stand the 1987 AIDS statement, while at the same time commissioning 
a second, possibly broader, statement. 
</P>
<P>
The new draft was commissioned "to carry the discussion further and . . . have 
behind it the weight of the entire American hierarchy," Bill Ryan, a spokesman 
for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-page statement, "Called to Compassion: A Response to the HIV/AIDS 
Crisis," is likely to be approved by the full body of bishops next month. HIV 
is the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS must be opposed with education, counseling and persuasion," the new 
document said. But it charged that promoting condom use is a "quick-fix tactic" 
doomed to failure in the long run." Although some studies have shown condoms 
are not a foolproof method of preventing infection, health officials advocate 
their use as one way of stemming the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"The safe-sex approach to preventing HIV/AIDS, though frequently advocated, 
compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous sexual behavior," the 
document said. "Not only is the use of prophylactics in an attempt to halt the 
spread of HIV technically unreliable; promoting this approach means, in effect, 
promoting behavior which is morally unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"We fault these programs for another reason as well. Recognizing that casual 
sex is a risk to health, (these programs) consistently advise the use of 
condoms in order to eliminate the risk. This is poor and inadequate advice." 
</P>
<P>
The official Catholic teaching against using contraceptive devices -- even 
within marriage -- is disregarded by a large majority of the nation's 
Catholics, according to the preponderance of surveys taken during the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
And the Catholic prohibition against using condoms to stem the AIDS epidemic 
runs counter to the policies of most mainline Protestant churches and Jewish 
agencies, which generally follow recommendations by the U.S. surgeon general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Albert Ogle, an Episcopal priest who directs the All Saints AIDS 
Service Center in Pasadena, criticized the new bishops' statement for "not 
addressing what is really happening in their communities." 
</P>
<P>
"The reality," Ogle said, "is that young people in our parishes are being 
infected by the virus and will get sick and die and infect others because the 
church has painted itself in a corner over birth control. . . . The (Catholic) 
Church is killing young people and that is not a pro-life stance." 
</P>
<P>
Ogle said he had worked with Mahony in founding the Interfaith AIDS Council of 
Southern California. He said he believes the Catholic Church could prevent the 
spread of AIDS in the Hispanic community, which is heavily Catholic, by 
realistically addressing the problem. "I believe there is moral judgment upon 
the church not to respond to that challenge," Ogle said. 
</P>
<P>
Retired United Methodist Bishop Melvin Wheatley called it "totally irrational" 
to think that providing condoms to people who are sexually active will 
undermine the church's teachings on abstinence. Wheatley of Laguna Hills will 
be the featured speaker Oct. 27 at a conference of the AIDS Interfaith Council 
of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Auxiliary Bishop Carl A. Fisher of Los Angeles said he hoped that the 
new statement will not totally negate the previous one. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher was among a number of bishops who had said they supported the earlier 
policy statement that Catholics could pass on information, such as that 
provided by the U.S. Public Health Service about condoms, "to persons who were 
not Catholic or not inclined to alter their conduct or actions" in spite of 
church teachings. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he felt the first statement was "a profound one" and realistically 
faced situations encountered by Catholics involved in counseling people in 
danger of contracting the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I work in the Long Beach area with persons who are dying from AIDS in some 
nine hospices," Fisher said. "I do not believe that withholding information . . 
. is going to help in the curtailment in the spread of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging new draft also opposes universal mandatory AIDS testing, calls 
for increasing federal funds for AIDS research and denounces violence and 
discrimination against AIDS victims as immoral. 
</P>
<P>
Needle exchange programs, in which drug abusers trade used needles for free 
new, clean ones -- because infected needles are considered to be a major means 
of transmitting AIDS -- are attacked in the document on grounds that "more drug 
use might result while fewer intravenous drug users sought treatment." 
</P>
<P>
"Distribution of free needles and syringes would send the message that 
intravenous drug use can be made safe," the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
In a passage directed at public policy-makers, the draft goes on to call for 
legislation that includes "helping to prevent the transmission of HIV, 
providing adequate medical care and protecting civil rights," including a ban 
on discrimination in employment, schooling, entertainment, business 
opportunities, housing and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"Compassion -- love -- toward persons infected with HIV is the only authentic 
response," the statement said. "Persons with AIDS are not distant, unfamiliar 
people, the objects of our mingled pity and aversion. We must keep them present 
to our consciousness, as individuals and a community and embrace them with 
unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mahony, others on the drafting committee are Cardinal Joseph L. 
Bernardin of Chicago, Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston, Archbishop William H. 
Keeler of Baltimore and Bishop Raymond W. Lessard of Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
If approved next month, the Catholic bishops' statement on AIDS will become a 
policy guideline for the nation's 55 million Catholics. Catholic hospitals, 
schools, social service agencies, priests and church workers will be expected 
to use it to convey church teachings on AIDS.

5 ACCUSED OF KILLING 2 MEN THEY TOOK FOR DEA AGENTS 
</P>

<P>
In a major spinoff of the investigation into the slaying of U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, an American citizen and four 
Mexican nationals have been indicted in the 1985 torture-murders of two 
Americans in Mexico who had been mistaken for narcotics agents, a DEA spokesman 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sealed indictment, returned Wednesday by a federal grand jury 
in Los Angeles, names a new individual as a defendant in the Camarena slaying, 
which took place about a month after the other two murders. 
</P>
<P>
The new defendant is Juan Gilberto Hernandez-Parra, described by DEA officials 
as "a federal judicial police officer" from Mexico. He is a fugitive believed 
to be at large in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Another individual named in the new indictment, Javier Vasquez-Velasco of 
Mexico, was arrested without incident in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday 
afternoon by members of the DEA's "Operation Leyenda Task Force," according to 
agency spokesman Ralph B. Lochridge. The task force was formed to investigate 
the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major step and a major culmination of the Camarena investigation," 
Lochridge said of the naming of defendants in the January, 1985, murders in 
Guadalajara, Mexico, of John Walker, 38, of St. Paul, Minn., and his friend, 
Albert Radelat, 32, of Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a Vietnam veteran who had been writing a book about the Mexican Mafia, 
and Radelat, a college student, apparently were the victims of mistaken 
identity, according to Mexican investigators. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of Jan. 30, 1985, they went to a restaurant called La Langosta 
(The Lobster), which was the scene of a private party hosted by Mexican drug 
lord Rafael Caro-Quintero and his sidekick, Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
Caro-Quintero and Fonseca-Carrillo, both currently in prison in Mexico on 
drug-trafficking convictions, were previously indicted on charges of conspiracy 
to kidnap and kill Camarena. In Wednesday's indictment, they both also were 
charged in the murders of Walker and Radelat. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mexican authorities, when the two Americans attempted to leave the 
restaurant, they were stopped by Caro-Quintero's bodyguards when someone 
identified them as "DEA spies." Both protested to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican investigators said the two were forced into separate rooms in the 
restaurant where they were tortured with knives and ice picks for more than an 
hour. Investigators believed Walker died from the torture and that Radelat was 
shot to death at a nearby park, where both were buried. 
</P>
<P>
"The killers believed they were DEA agents," recounted Lochridge. "So we 
believe the killers felt very macho" when the DEA took no immediate action in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Since they were not DEA agents, we weren't immediately aware of their 
murders," the DEA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Camarena, 37, was kidnaped as he left the U.S. Consulate in 
Guadalajara to meet his wife for lunch. His severely beaten body and that of 
his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were found several weeks later on a remote 
ranch 70 miles north of that city. 
</P>
<P>
In the new indictment returned Wednesday, five individuals in all were indicted 
in the murders of Walker and Radelat. 
</P>
<P>
They are: Hernandez-Parra; Vasquez-Velasco; Caro-Quintero, described by drug 
investigators as the mastermind of the murder of Camarena; Fonseca-Carrillo; 
and Ezequiel Godinez-Cervantes, a U.S. citizen who escaped from Lompoc Federal 
Penitentiary, where he was serving a prison term on drug charges. He was 
subsequently captured in Mexico and is in prison term there on a drug 
trafficking conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the five indicted on Wednesday, Vasquez-Velasco and Godinez-Cervantes, 
have not been charged in the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Mexican nationals, Rene Verdugo Urquidez, one of Caro-Quintero's top 
lieutenants, and Raul Alvarez-Lopez, a Mexican state police officer, were each 
sentenced in Los Angeles federal court in October, 1988, to life plus 240 years 
in prison for their roles in the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Another Mexican national, Jesus Felix Gutierrez, received a maximum of 10 years 
when he was sentenced in federal court in Los Angeles in September, 1988, for 
helping Caro-Quintero flee to Costa Rica in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid 
prosecution in the Camareno murder. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another defendant, Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, a state police homicide 
investigator from Guadalajara, is awaiting trial in Los Angeles in the Camarena 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokesman Lochridge said the Camarena investigation has not concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate additional arrests and prosecutions," he said. "The DEA will not 
rest until everyone involved is captured and prosecuted."

NEW BILL PUTS FEWER LIMITS ON USE OF DESERT 
</P>

<P>
Four California congressmen introduced legislation Thursday that would 
designate 2.1 million acres of the Southern California desert as wilderness 
while preserving grazing rights and authorizing motor vehicle access in some 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The new move in the years-long battle over desert policy has the support of 
multiple-use advocates who are fiercely opposed to more restrictive legislation 
introduced earlier by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mel Levine 
(D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), chief sponsor of the latest bill, said it 
reflects "a strongly held public desire to preserve and protect one of the 
crown jewels of America's public lands." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and Levine, however, denounced it as a travesty and an attack on 
federal wilderness legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than providing protection, Levine said, the Lewis bill amounts to "a new 
kind of warfare on the wilderness unlike any before" and "turns the clock back 
to the original debate of the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
The 2.1 million acres to be designated as permanent wilderness area would be in 
51 tracts to be designated by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
In at least three of the wilderness areas, vehicle access would be permitted 
with the permission of the secretary of the interior. Livestock grazing would 
be allowed to continue in areas where it had begun before the wilderness 
designation became effective. 
</P>
<P>
Eight back-country trail systems, accessible to the handicapped, would be 
developed on the fringe of wilderness. Authority to expand them would be 
conferred on the interior secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the measure characterized it as the culmination of a process begun 
in 1976 when the Bureau of Land Management was directed by Congress to develop 
a master plan for federal land planning and management. 
</P>
<P>
During five years of ensuing hearings and deliberations, more than 40,000 
Californians wrote the Bureau of Land Management, testified at hearings or 
otherwise conveyed their views on desert lands policy. The four lawmakers who 
shaped the proposal said that it is an outgrowth of that interchange. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Lewis, the bill's principal sponsors are Reps. Duncan L. Hunter 
(R-Coronado), William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) and Al McCandless (R-Bermuda 
Dunes), whose districts represent most of the Southern California desert. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that the bill introduced by Cranston and Levine and strongly 
supported by environmental groups is a product of outsiders, Lewis said his 
34-page alternative "is the people's bill." 
</P>
<P>
The more extensive Cranston and Levine proposal would create a 1.5 million-acre 
Mojave National Park east of Barstow, designate 4.4 million acres in 81 
separate tracts as permanent wilderness, greatly expand the Death Valley and 
Joshua Tree national monuments by making both national parks and add 20,500 
acres to Red Rock Canyon State Park. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 3 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land would be 
transferred to the National Park Service, which conservationists believe would 
be more attentive to its management. 
</P>
<P>
The Cranston-Levine bill has stirred bitter opposition from cattlemen, mining 
interests, recreational users and even the military. 
</P>
<P>
The routes and numbers of military training flights would be frozen under the 
Cranston-Levine measure, while the Lewis bill would explicitly prohibit any 
restrictions on military overflights in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists want to sharply limit vehicular access to the desert areas. 
But Hunter said that such access is central to the Lewis proposal, calling the 
desert "the playground of the working people of California." 
</P>
<P>
"In the desert," he said, "access is everything, and that means motorized 
access." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston called the rival bill "totally unacceptable." He said it is worse than 
the status quo because it would permit vehicles in some wilderness areas, 
prevent the government from determining the legitimacy of mining claims, weaken 
grazing restrictions and prohibit future designation of wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals will be aired in a new round of congressional field hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the national parks and public lands 
subcommittee of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, has scheduled 
an Oct. 28 hearing in Bishop and a Nov. 3 hearing in Barstow. A third hearing 
is expected to be scheduled in Los Angeles early next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Land Management was directed by Congress in 1976 to develop a 
master plan for federal land planning and management. During the next five 
years, more than 40,000 Californians wrote BLM, testified at hearings or 
otherwise conveyed their views on desert lands policy. Thursday's plan would 
protect the interests of many ranchers and off-road vehicle users in the 
California desert, while a competing proposal sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston 
and Rep. Mel Levine is favored by environmentalists.

CHENEY THREATENS HE'LL URGE VETO IF 'STAR WARS' IS CUT 
</P>

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a spirited defense of the proposed "Star 
Wars" missile defense system, said Thursday he will urge President Bush to veto 
the 1990 defense appropriations bill if it provides "inadequate funding" for 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's comments came as House and Senate lawmakers entered their fifth week 
of negotiations on the military funding measure. Differences between the two 
chambers on "Star Wars" funding have been one of the most divisive issues in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, a former Republican House leader who was an ardent supporter of the 
program on Capitol Hill, refused to specify what level of funding would prompt 
his veto recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The House has proposed to cut the Bush Administration's $4.6-billion "Star 
Wars" request to slightly less than $3 billion for the fiscal year that began 
Oct. 1. The Senate has approved a budget of just over $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic lawmakers reacted skeptically to Cheney's threats. By not 
specifying a minimum funding level, they maintained, Cheney implicitly left the 
figure open to negotiation. They said the defense secretary's threats might 
have been designed to appease conservative backers of the program rather than 
to boost the 1990 funding figure.

In a speech before a Washington-based defense group, Cheney touted the 
technological progress of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the "Star Wars" 
program is formally known, saying it has proven that space weapons can be built 
to blunt a Soviet first strike and provide U.S. cities with a defense against a 
Third World missile assault. 
</P>
<P>
"An effective strategic defense could be the single most important military 
bequest this generation could make to the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another effort to solidify support for "Star Wars," the Pentagon is 
circulating the results of two scientific studies that favorably assess the 
Pentagon's proposed development of missile-killing bullets known as "brilliant 
pebbles" as an initial space-based defense. 
</P>
<P>
According to knowledgeable defense officials, the Defense Science Board, a team 
of independent technical experts, recently told senior Pentagon officials the 
brilliant pebbles proposal is feasible. A second advisory board of independent 
scientists, known as the Jasons, also concluded that brilliant pebbles is 
worthy of further research, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent Washington symposium, however, the director of the Jasons' 
brilliant pebbles study was highly critical of the project. John M. Cornwall, a 
physicist at UCLA, recently told the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science that brilliant pebbles could be countered by the Soviets. He added that 
despite claims by the program's proponents, the system could not be built 
cheaply using components already readily available. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, however, offered a buoyant assessment of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very encouraged by the potential contribution that brilliant pebbles can 
make to strategic defenses," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also sought to deflect charges by the program's opponents 
that the Bush Administration's scaled-back plans for "Star Wars" would result 
in an imperfect defense that would allow nuclear warheads to leak through. 
</P>
<P>
"I call on the critics to cease their attempts to make perfection the enemy of 
the good, and let's get down to the real debate about how defenses fit into our 
strategy for nuclear stability, deterrence and arms reductions." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon believes that the first-phase of a "Star Wars" deployment, which 
could begin as early as 1994 "could provide effective population defense 
against limited missile launches," Cheney said.

A farm family whose cornfield yielded a key piece of wreckage from United 
Airlines Flight 232 that crashed in Sioux City in July collected a $116,000 
reward Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Sorenson of rural Alta ran over a titanium fan blade disk while 
combining corn on Tuesday. The piece came from a General Electric tail engine 
on the United DC-10 that crashed July 19, killing 112 of the 296 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The disk is considered the most essential piece of evidence to finding out why 
the plane's No. 2 engine disintegrated in flight. General Electric offered 
$50,000 for return of the disk alone and a total of $271,000 in rewards for 
other missing engine parts such as bolts and fan blades. The disk pulled from 
the Sorenson's farm field contained many other parts sought by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
GE field representative Jerry Clark presented a check for $116,000 to the 
Sorensons on Thursday and said another check for $3,000 will be coming later. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give some to charity, although I don't know about our church," Janice 
Sorenson said. "My grandfather said he saw two churches ruined after they 
received a lot of money."

TEAMSTER LEADERS FIGHTING TO CURB PANEL NAMED TO RID UNION OF MAFIA INFLUENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the Teamsters Union are chafing under the supervision of three 
outside monitors appointed by a federal judge last spring to rid the nation's 
largest union of the influence of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
Officers of the 1.6-million-member union had agreed to the appointments so that 
a civil racketeering lawsuit against the Teamsters could be settled without a 
trial. The legal action had been filed by the Justice Department last year. 
</P>
<P>
But a behind-the-scenes fight has developed over sweeping powers that the three 
independent overseers want to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
So bitter, in fact, has the struggle become that both sides are asking for 
court intervention, and U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein of Manhattan has 
called a hearing for this morning to try to resolve the issues. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents obtained by The Times, Teamsters general counsel James 
T. Grady has written to Frederick B. Lacey, whom Edelstein appointed as union 
administrator last May, contending that Lacey is exceeding his authority as 
chairman of the oversight board. 
</P>
<P>
Grady charged also that the hourly fees and demands for private office space of 
the three monitors, all lawyers, could reach more than $1 million a year, which 
he termed too high a price for the union to pay. The union has paid none of the 
expenses submitted to it by the monitors so far. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey, a former federal judge in New Jersey, responded hotly that the Teamsters 
had agreed last March to pay all reasonable costs of the monitors and their 
staffs and thus is reneging on the court-approved agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said that the union apparently has resolved "that it is going to try to 
do everything it can to slow down or impair the functions of the 
court-appointed officials." He called Grady's position "unacceptable and 
incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorney Randy M. Mastro, agreeing with Lacey, has written 
to Judge Edelstein that Teamster leaders have "blatantly attempted to frustrate 
the work of the court officers" by refusing to provide funds to cover their 
fees and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But Grady countered that the court agreement provides only that "reasonable" 
costs should be charged to the Teamsters. He said that Lacey's jurisdiction is 
limited and the union would not allow him to examine books and records of 
pension funds, employee benefit operations and certain other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey, who practices law in Newark, N. J., was given broad review powers over 
Teamster operations. The settlement accords him "the same rights and powers" as 
Teamster President William J. McCarthy in certain instances. Lacey maintains 
that his mandate allows him to question the appointment of vice presidents by 
McCarthy and to delve into all major union expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said also that he plans to promulgate guidelines "for investigation and 
discipline of corruption within the IBT (International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters)." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the primary responsibility for investigating the 
scandal-plagued union rests with Charles M. Carberry, a New York lawyer and 
former federal prosecutor whom Judge Edelstein named as "investigations 
officer." Carberry may bring cases before Lacey, who is empowered to act as a 
hearing officer. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his first moves, Carberry is seeking the ouster of Harold Friedman, 
an international vice president, and Tony Hughes, an international 
representative. Friedman and Hughes are trying to keep their posts in spite of 
being convicted last January on racketeering and embezzlement charges in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
A third court-appointed officer, Chicago labor attorney Michael H. Holland, 
will supervise the Teamsters' first-ever secret ballot direct elections of the 
president and delegates in 1991. Teamster leaders already are fighting Carberry 
and Holland over private office space and funds for staff assistants that they 
contend they must have. 
</P>
<P>
The court settlement that provided for the three Teamster overseers grew out of 
an unprecedented civil racketeering suit in which the Justice Department 
contended that the union had been heavily influenced by organized crime for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Teamster leaders, although arguing that the lawsuit was politically motivated 
and without merit, ultimately agreed to a settlement that, according to one 
former union source, "gave the government nearly everything it wanted." 
</P>
<P>
"The (Teamster) executive board approved the settlement because it allowed 
McCarthy and other board members to keep their highly paid jobs until they 
retire in a few years," the source said, speaking on condition that he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their voluntary consent order, McCarthy and other Teamster leaders 
acknowledged that "there have been allegations, sworn testimony and judicial 
findings of past problems with La Cosa Nostra corruption of various elements of 
(the Teamsters)."

CONVICTION OF PALME SUSPECT IS OVERTURNED

An appeals court Thursday freed a man convicted of killing Prime Minister Olof 
Palme, ruling that there was not enough evidence to find him guilty of the 
crime that traumatized Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Christer Pettersson, 42, who maintained his innocence throughout his 
sensational trial, walked away from Kronoberg prison hours after the Svea 
Appeals Court threw out his July conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had charged that Pettersson, who has a long criminal record and a 
history of drug and alcohol abuse, gunned down the popular Swedish leader on a 
Stockholm street in 1986. He had been sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised. I never really believed I would be acquitted, although I am 
innocent," Pettersson said after his release. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ruling could dash any hopes authorities have of bringing Palme's 
killer to justice. It is the biggest setback in a three-year investigation that 
critics have said was bungled from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Joergen Almblad said he would not decide whether to appeal to the 
Supreme Court until the appeals court issues its formal verdict Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson vowed to press ahead with the hunt for Palme's 
killer. "The work in this investigation must continue with full force," 
Carlsson said. 
</P>
<P>
Pettersson was convicted even though no motive was established, no weapon was 
found and no witnesses testified to seeing the Swede fire five shots at Palme. 
</P>
<P>
Palme's widow, the only witness close to the scene, testified she was "100% 
certain" it was Pettersson she saw staring at her from a few feet away after 
her husband fell to the ground, mortally wounded.

TALKS ON LEBANON PACT STALLED AS CHRISTIAN CHIEF STORMS OUT

Talks on a tentative accord for shifting power to Lebanon's Muslim majority 
temporarily collapsed Thursday when a right-wing Christian leader stormed out, 
refusing to accept any plan that did not provide for Syria's withdrawal from 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The acrimonious, closed-door bargaining session, which followed an exhausting, 
round-the-clock series of meetings the night before, reflected Lebanese 
lawmakers' increasing frustration over their failure to reach agreement on a 
permanent peace plan after nearly two weeks of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Only hours before dawn Thursday, a special negotiating committee of 
parliamentary deputies reported that they had reached tentative accord on a 
political reform plan that would for the first time give Muslims an equal voice 
in Parliament and limit the powers of the Maronite Christian president. 
</P>
<P>
But talks on putting the tentative agreement into writing broke down after five 
hours Thursday night when Georges Saade, head of the Lebanese Front and the 
leading right-wing Christian in Parliament, walked out of the session in 
response to new "conditions" proposed by Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions reportedly included a new effort to wipe out the religious basis 
upon which Lebanon's government has historically been built. 
</P>
<P>
Saade, in a brief statement to reporters, did not identify the conditions that 
led to the breakdown in the talks. But he said they reached "basic and 
essential issues which cannot be accepted in any form whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources close to the negotiations said the Christians' objections arose 
when a Muslim deputy proposed to include in the agreement a plan to abolish 
religious sectarianism as the basis for political power in the Lebanese 
government. The tentative accord would have left that controversial issue to 
the new government. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Saade also had vowed not to accept any political reform plan unless 
Parliament first settles on an acceptable timetable for withdrawal of the 
estimated 40,000 Syrian troops that now occupy about two-thirds of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
After a marathon bargaining session, the committee of nine Christians and eight 
Muslims had reached a tentative accord on a wide-ranging plan for sharing power 
within Parliament and the Cabinet and boost the number of Muslim seats. 
</P>
<P>
It would leave the Christian president as formal chief of the armed forces but 
would transfer to the Cabinet and the Sunni Muslim prime minister most actual 
authority over the army.

CANADA'S MULRONEY SEEKS QUICK PACT ON ACID RAIN; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS TO SEE AN END TO U.S.-PRODUCED 
CONTAMINANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Thursday expressed disappointment in 
the Bush Administration's proposal to curb acid rain, but said he would be 
"satisfied" with its approval and will move for a quick acid rain agreement 
between the nations. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to editors and reporters of The Times in Los Angeles, Mulroney said 
Canada "would like more" than Bush proposed, which was a cut of about 50% by 
the year 2000 in the U.S.-produced oxides that Canadians believe have destroyed 
15,000 lakes and damaged 150,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush acid rain plan is part of a comprehensive environmental package now 
being considered by the House. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney himself two years ago proposed a 50% cut by 1994 in U.S. sulfide and 
nitrogen oxide emissions, which travel in the atmosphere from the industrial 
upper Midwest to New England and Canada, where the pollutants fall in the form 
of acid rain, snow or particulate. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like the Americans to have done something similar," said the prime 
minister, who was on his first official visit to Los Angeles. But, he added, 
"we're satisfied this represents substantial progress." 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney also used his Los Angeles stop to announce that Canada, following the 
lead of the United States and several European nations, was forwarding a 
$42-million aid package for Poland and Hungary to help prod those nations 
toward democracy and economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace of change (in Eastern Europe) is both breathtaking and astounding," 
Mulroney told 850 guests of the World Affairs Council, meeting at the 
Bonaventure Hotel on Thursday. "But its outcome, particularly in Poland, 
remains in doubt. . . . Those countries need assistance, and they need it now." 
</P>
<P>
Bush last week added $200 million in aid for Poland, bringing to $427 million 
the amount of total aid the United States intends to send to Warsaw. The 
American and Canadian grants bring to almost $700 million the amount pledged so 
far by the world's nations. The new, Solidarity-led government in Warsaw has 
asked for $1 billion in outside funds to help prop up its economy. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney's acceptance of Bush's acid rain plan -- even though it essentially 
doubles the amount of time required to cut back acid rain-causing emissions -- 
was a symbol of how strongly the Canadians are welcoming any movement after 
unsuccessfully pleading for assistance on the environmental front during the 
Ronald Reagan Administration. The issue has been a major sticking point between 
the nations. 
</P>
<P>
But Mulroney indicated that Canada is not putting all its faith in the 
Republican Administration. Several times during an interview, he noted that 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, has vowed to 
see the clean air legislation pass. 
</P>
<P>
In other comments during his Los Angeles stay, Mulroney praised the 
U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement, approved last year after years of wrangling 
-- and still unpopular among many Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
Gesturing toward former President Ronald Reagan, who introduced Mulroney at the 
World Affairs Council gathering, the prime minister said the agreement would 
"rank among President Reagan's finest legacies."

COUP LEADERS GAVE NORIEGA 2 OPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: SOURCES CLOSE TO THE REBEL OFFICERS SAY THERE WAS NO DISAGREEMENT ON 
WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.

The leaders of last week's abortive coup in Panama gave Gen. Manuel A. Noriega 
a choice of retiring and going into exile in Panama or being turned over for 
extradition to the United States on drug charges, sources close to the uprising 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no disagreement between the officers over what to do with Noriega," 
one source said. "They were clear on what they planned to do. They wanted 
Noriega to step down and accept exile. But they were agreed that they would 
turn him over to the Americans if he refused their ultimatum." 
</P>
<P>
The source, a Panamanian military officer who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity, said he believes the understanding was conveyed to U.S. officials at 
a clandestine meeting in the town of La Boca, near the Panama Canal, two days 
before the Oct. 3 coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier accounts of the coup indicated that its leaders were paralyzed during 
the crucial hours in which they held Noriega over whether to allow him to 
remain in Panama or turn him over to U.S. officials for extradition. 
</P>
<P>
The new account portrays the coup leaders as united in presenting the 
Panamanian strongman with a clear choice, contradicting suggestions that 
indecision on the part of the organizers prevented U.S. officials from playing 
a more active role in the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, widow of Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, leader of the 
coup, told reporters Thursday that she arranged the meeting in La Baca between 
her husband and three U.S. officials with the help of an American woman who had 
contacts at Ft. Clayton, a U.S. Army base adjacent to the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Giroldi said that the friend, whom she declined to identify, arranged for the 
Giroldis to come to a private house in La Boca, where they were met by a U.S. 
colonel and two men in civilian clothes, on the evening of Sunday, Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and the other men went into a room, and when they came out my 
husband told me that everything was arranged, that everything would come out 
all right," Giroldi said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that while her husband had refused to go into details of what was 
discussed, he "seemed confident after the meeting and kept saying that 
everything was fixed." 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian military source said that the meeting lasted about 20 minutes. 
After it ended, Maj. Giroldi told Capt. Javier Licona, his second-in-command, 
that the two men in civilian dress were from the CIA, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave Giroldi a special telephone number to call in case he needed to 
contact them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the source could not confirm that plans to turn Noriega over to U.S. 
forces were discussed, he said Maj. Giroldi left his subordinates with the 
"clear impression" that arrangements deciding the dictator's fate had been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials, seeking to explain why the United States did not 
do more to help the rebels, in view of advance knowledge of the coup, have said 
that Maj. Giroldi and his fellow officers could not agree on whether to turn 
Noriega over to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the military source, who said that his account was based on several 
conversations with Licona, disputed the Bush Administration portrayal. It was 
"always their intention to turn Noriega over to the Americans if he refused to 
accept retirement and exile somewhere else," the source said. "There was no 
disagreement about this." 
</P>
<P>
Another source, agreeing with this account, said Maj. Giroldi was adamant about 
only one thing -- that Noriega not be executed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were made to understand that if we killed Noriega, Giroldi would kill us," 
said the source, who participated in the coup. 
</P>
<P>
Giroldi said that after the clandestine Sunday meeting with the Americans, her 
husband went back to his headquarters while she spent the next day at home, 
sick with fear. "We spent Monday night together, but after that I did not see 
him again," she said, her eyes welling with tears. 
</P>
<P>
The coup began the following morning, when Maj. Giroldi took Noriega and six 
colonels captive as they arrived at military headquarters near downtown Panama 
City. 
</P>
<P>
What happened after that remains subject to dispute. But a clearer picture is 
beginning to emerge with the testimony of several participants, who along with 
Giroldi were among a group of 42 Panamanians flown to Miami on Sunday after 
taking refuge at Ft. Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the coup participants, who are in hiding throughout the Miami area, 
have been reluctant to talk out of fear for the welfare of the families they 
left behind in Panama. Licona, the highest-ranking officer to survive the coup, 
was described by a close associate as being "very scared and nervous" after 
speaking by telephone to his mother in Panama City on Wednesday night and 
"learning that Noriega's men had bulldozed his home." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, the State Department disputed claims by Noriega, made 
during an interview with The Times on Wednesday night, that the junior officers 
who tried to oust him had been recruited by U.S. officials and were paid more 
than $1 million to launch the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absurd . . . that the United States paid for the coup plotters," State 
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Norman Kempster, in Washington, contributed to this report.

LATIN LEADERS PUSH FOR REGIONAL ALLIANCE;

Seven Latin American presidents, their nations mired in inflation and 
recession, resolved Thursday to push forward with economic integration by 1992 
to keep from falling behind the world's emerging regional economic blocs. 
</P>
<P>
Ending their third annual summit a day early, the group also reaffirmed the 
suspension of Panama to protest Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's crushing of democracy 
there. However, the seven presidents stopped short of expelling Panama 
outright, as some countries wanted. 
</P>
<P>
While condemning Noriega for flouting democracy in Panama, the presidents noted 
that democratic rule has been consolidated throughout the region in the 1980s, 
including this year in Chile and Paraguay. The priority now, the group 
declared, is to match that political freedom with economic and social justice. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents' remarks in opening the conference Wednesday and the closing 
communique Thursday offered a measure of the changing attitudes in the region: 
No longer did they place all blame on the industrialized world for their 
problems of debt, violence and economic decline. Rather, the tone was one of 
looking within both for the diagnosis and the cure. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents said their foreign ministers will meet Dec. 4-5 in Argentina to 
devise a program for major advances in Latin American integration before 1992. 
That year is both the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America and 
the year when the European Community will complete its economic integration, 
cited as a model by several presidents. 
</P>
<P>
They stated several goals: substituting regional import bans with tariffs and 
then gradually reducing those tariffs; removing physical obstacles to trade, 
especially in transport and communications, and adopting joint scientific and 
technology ventures. Communications and transport ministers will meet within 60 
days to work out accords on joint projects involving satellites and transport 
links. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Group of Eight was formed in 1986 to build a political voice for 
Latin American democracies and initially focused on demanding concessions from 
more developed countries, particularly on the region's foreign debt of more 
than $400 billion. This time, the stress was on self-help. 
</P>
<P>
The three newly elected presidents, Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, emphasized 
the need to modernize the region's economies and join the world marketplace -- 
or perish in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
All three of those countries have adopted painful reform plans to cut 
inflation, streamline their bureaucracies and reduce subsidies to industries 
that encouraged inefficiency and lack of competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"In this new world, there will be constantly less space for those stuck in old 
nationalisms," Menem said. "Nobody will be able to do for us that which we are 
not capable of doing for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against a vision of Latin American unity that would merely mean 
regional protectionism. "That would be repeating on a larger scale the same 
isolationist concepts of the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The four other presidents at the summit are all in their final months in 
office. Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia and Julio Maria Sanguinetti of 
Uruguay already have embraced conservative economic programs, and their 
economies are comparatively healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The final pair, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jose Sarney of Brazil, have largely 
avoided the market-opening policies of their colleagues, and both economies are 
sinking in inflation and economic malaise. The front-runners to succeed them, 
however, have proposed orthodox reform programs. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Latin group is likely to offer a markedly more conservative, uniform 
outlook at its next annual summit in Venezuela.

U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed sending 625 military 
and civilian personnel to Central America in the first major U.N. peacekeeping 
operation in the Western Hemisphere. However, State Department spokeswoman 
Margaret Tutwiler hinted at U.S. concerns about the plans and refused to say 
whether Washington would support it or exercise its Security Council veto to 
squash the proposal. The effectiveness of such a contingent would mean there is 
agreement among the five major powers, including the United States, to cut off 
aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and the insurgents in El Salvador.

LAWMAKERS PRAISE KEMP'S HUD REFORM PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: SOME HOUSE MEMBERS CAUTION THE SECRETARY AGAINST 'OVERKILL' BY 
ALTERING REGULATIONS ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS.

<P>
Members of Congress praised Housing Secretary Jack Kemp Thursday for his 
proposals to reform the beleaguered Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, but they cautioned him not to engage in "overkill" in changing 
agency programs. 
</P>
<P>
"As I look at the scandals that have been revealed at HUD, it is my view that 
what we have seen is a people problem, not a program problem," said Rep. Henry 
B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the housing and community development 
subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
Gonzalez's panel is one of several conducting HUD inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have had in the last eight years at HUD are ambitious and venal people 
who betrayed their public trust," Gonzalez said during a hearing at which Kemp 
described his reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"I make the distinction between scandalous mismanagement and the integrity of 
HUD programs," Gonzalez said. "These programs work when people of good will are 
there to administer them." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp has offered a package of reforms to clean up his department, which has 
been tainted by allegations of influence peddling and political favoritism 
during the Ronald Reagan Administration. Some of Kemp's planned reforms will 
require congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's proposals include naming a top financial officer for the department and 
requiring public registration of all HUD lobbyists and consultants to 
discourage influence peddling and mishandling of funds. He also has proposed 
changes in several HUD programs to ensure that HUD money is directed to low- 
and moderate-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ohio lawmakers took issue with Kemp's proposal to change the popular 
Community Development Block Grant program by increasing the proportion of funds 
required to be used for the benefit of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The program now allows 40% of the grants made to the states to be used for 
projects that do not directly benefit low-income persons. Kemp, noting that 
some states have used the money for projects such as bike racks and swimming 
pools, wants to reduce that share to 25%. Further, he has proposed that 
wealthier communities be required to use 100% of their grants for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D-Ohio), complaining that she was "not responsible 
because someone in New York got a swimming pool," insisted that the local 
officials in her district operate the program effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"To stifle a certain degree of flexibility of the program would be absolutely 
outrageous," Oakar said. "Don't blame the program -- we just need better 
management. . . . There's such a thing as overkill." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie (R-Ohio) said the money has been used by cities to 
replace reduced federal revenue sharing and told Kemp that the fact that "you 
honed in" on the Community Development Block Grant program bothered him because 
the program has been effective in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp assured Oakar that he was "not out to get it (the program)," but said he 
felt it would be difficult to defend a program "that allows monies to be spent 
without some guidelines." He said his proposed 75% allocation to benefit the 
poor was "hardly Kemp scorched-earth policy." 
</P>
<P>
Oakar also told Kemp she would not allow the new climate of reform to deter her 
from fighting for housing projects for her city. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not an ombudsman for my area, I ought to be thrown out of office," she 
said. "Sometimes I get the impression that what we're going to do is have a 
fortress built up as an overreaction. I don't want to see that happen." Kemp 
responded he would "personally fire" any HUD employee who was disrespectful to 
a member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a group of reporters later in the day, Kemp said he was 
surprised -- and somewhat amused -- at Oakar's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"A Democrat criticizing a Republican for trying to fight poverty," he said. 
"We've come full circle. I was very surprised at Mary Rose Oakar -- that she 
would put herself in the position of making an inference we were targeting too 
much to low income. I would love to have a debate on that." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp told reporters he believed he was receiving "generally good marks" for his 
proposals and that there "seems to be a lot of good will." Everyone, he said, 
"wants to see HUD back on its feet and aimed in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't think I have anyone in Congress saying, 'I hope Kemp screws 
up.' "

SENATE SEEMS UNLIKELY TO PASS CAPITAL GAINS CUT; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: LAWMAKERS TRY TO PARE PET PROJECTS FROM THE DEFICIT-REDUCTION BILL AS A 
MONDAY DEADLINE NEARS.

<P>
As the Senate began slogging through a $14.1-billion deficit-reduction bill 
Thursday, both Democrats and Republicans agreed that there probably are not 
enough votes to include a capital gains tax cut in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said that his party would make 
several attempts to amend the Senate budget bill to add the capital gains tax 
cut supported by President Bush. If that effort fails, Dole said, Republicans 
will attempt to add the tax cut to other essential legislation, such as a bill 
on the federal debt limit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to offer it every chance we have," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
This could include using a variety of delaying tactics, such as a move to force 
a vote on the House bill that includes the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
"Capital gains threatens to freeze us altogether," said Senate Budget Committee 
Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, White House officials said it was doubtful that they would 
insist on a showdown when the Senate votes on the deficit bill today. But they 
vowed to pursue Bush's campaign pledge to reduce capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, leaders of both parties were moving toward an agreement on a 
plan aimed at dropping more than 100 extraneous items from the deficit measure. 
But numerous disputes are expected over such issues as child care and dozens of 
special interest tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the major purpose of the spending bill is to reduce the deficit in the 
current budget year to about $110 billion, most of its bulk is attributable to 
hundreds of lawmakers' pet projects. In a brief session of the Senate Budget 
Committee, members complained that many of the items will actually add to the 
budget deficit in future years. 
</P>
<P>
One feature of the bill would benefit owners of tuxedo-rental stores; others 
would reduce borrowing costs on rural electric loans, aid small farmers and 
allow wealthy families to continue taking advantage of a loophole whereby 
grandparents can give their grandchildren up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is the trashing of the budget process," said Sen. William L. 
Armstrong (R-Col.). 
</P>
<P>
Because lawmakers are certain to fail to complete action on the bill before a 
Monday deadline, the deficit-reduction law will trigger automatic, 
across-the-board cuts of about $16 billion in a wide variety of federal 
spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress is expected to restore the cut funds as soon as it finishes the 
deficit-reduction bill. 
</P>
<P>
The House has already approved a $10.9-billion deficit-reduction bill that 
contains a two-year capital gains tax cut. Any differences between the Senate 
and House versions would be ironed out in a conference committee, which is 
expected to be at work for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the capital gains tax cut advocated by the Bush Administration, the 
Senate bill includes a plan pushed by Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen 
(D-Tex.) to allow more taxpayers to take at least partial deductions for 
individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans and a handful of Democrats have been working together on a proposal 
for a permanent capital gains cut of no more than 35% from current levels. They 
plan also to offer investors an alternative of adjusting investment profits to 
eliminate the effects of inflation and to provide additional tax breaks for 
venture capital. 
</P>
<P>
During the first hours of debate on the bill, the Senate approved only one 
amendment, agreeing to spend an extra $40 million to aid rural hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser acknowledged that the bill "does not boldly address a deficit problem" 
but insisted it was better than imposing automatic budget cuts and at least 
meets the guidelines agreed on by the White House and Congress last April.

PANEL PUSHES FOR SAFETY CHANGES ON SCHOOL BUSES

More safety features are needed on the nation's 41,000 small school buses to 
protect children in accidents, the head of the National Transportation Safety 
Board said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
James Kolstad, acting board chairman, said an investigation into the buses that 
make up 10% to 15% of the total school bus fleet shows that injuries to 
students in accidents generally have been minor. 
</P>
<P>
"But the board believes that improvements can be made," Kolstad said in 
discussing the report adopted by the board Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report found small buses to be generally safe but called for improved 
front-door latches and windshield retention and several tests to determine 
whether tough standards for larger buses should be extended to those built to 
carry between 10 and 24 children. 
</P>
<P>
The board said that although school buses remain one of the safest of all forms 
of transportation, some smaller buses have been modified in ways that increase 
the chance of injury in a crash, particularly to children in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, passenger lap belts and other restraints had been installed . . 
. in a manner inconsistent with federal standards for seat belts, diminishing 
crash protection and increasing the potential to induce injury," the board said 
in its findings. " . . . Small school buses lack the built-in crash advantage 
of superior size and weight provided by large school buses."

Former Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg has endowed a $1-million public service 
fellowship program at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Mass., in honor of Judge 
Irving R. Kaufman's 40 years on the federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment will fund fellowships for students or recent alumni who want to 
enter public service, Harvard officials said. The first awards, in the amount 
of $10,000 each, will be made for the academic year 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, 79, was appointed to the federal bench in 1949 by President Harry S. 
Truman. He served 12 years in the Southern District of New York before being 
elevated to the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961.

organization. The surveillance of the guild from 1940 to 1975 amassed over 1 
million pages of FBI files. Under the agreement, which must be approved by a 
federal court, the FBI has agreed to restrict use of those files before turning 
them over to the National Archives and Records Service. The guild has agreed to

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said the Bush Administration has unqualified support 
for Senate-passed civil rights legislation to protect the disabled. The 
Americans With Disabilities Act passed Sept. 7 after negotiations between 
senators and the White House to soften some of the impact on business. 
Thornburgh had expressed reservations about the bill, but told the House 
Judiciary Committee those concerns had been resolved. The bill guarantees the 
disabled equal access to public accommodations and employment opportunities.

Blacks and whites flooded the offices of Georgia's largest school system with 
panic calls in response to a federal appeals court ruling that may require 
forced busing. "There has certainly been a number of calls expressing grave 
concern both from the black and white communities," said Andy Olsen, a 
spokesman for the De Kalb County school system. The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of 
Appeals Wednesday ordered the school system to consider redrawing district 
lines and busing to achieve more desegregation. Olsen said administrators were 
meeting with school system attorneys to go over the order.

OAKLAND REPORTS A HITCH IN BID TO LURE RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland authorities are reporting a serious hitch in their attempts to entice 
the Los Angeles Raiders back to the East Bay city, with the Oakland A's 
baseball team objecting to some of the renovations planned for the Raiders at 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
However, reports in Bay Area newspapers that the A's have threatened to leave 
Oakland if the Raiders come back are untrue, according to both an A's spokesman 
and Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata, who has led the Oakland effort to win 
back the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said Thursday that it will be necessary to confer with the A's before 
Oakland's offer to the Raiders can be finalized, because the A's "have a 
contractual right to approve any reconfiguration or remodeling of the stadium." 
He said talks with the A's will not begin until after the World Series, in 
which the A's are playing the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland has tentatively offered the Raiders $53 million in stadium renovations, 
including an expansion of the stadium's seating capacity from about 50,000 to 
65,000. Such an expansion might force changes in the alignment of the baseball 
field as well as the football field. 
</P>
<P>
The A's chief operating officer, Walter Haas, said last week the A's are also 
concerned that aggressive marketing of Raiders games could adversely affect the 
A's business, and the president of the Golden State Warriors basketball 
franchise, Dan Finnane, said he is concerned that bringing in the Raiders could 
"stretch the sports dollar" in the East Bay too much for his team's good. The 
Warriors play in an indoor arena that is part of the Oakland Coliseum complex. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said Thursday that the experience of both Candlestick Park in San 
Francisco and Anaheim Stadium indicates that major professional baseball and 
football franchises can coexist in the same facility without suffering 
competitively. He said he is certain that there is room in Oakland for the A's, 
the Raiders and the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
But, Perata added, just for the record, Oakland authorities would not be 
interested in bringing in the Raiders if it meant losing the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan said 
Thursday that he has been told privately that Oakland is fading as a prospect 
for a Raiders move and that Los Angeles' real competition may be Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said, however, that he understands that cost estimates for building a 
stadium for the Raiders in Sacramento have been coming in higher than 
Sacramento entrepreneurs expected. 
</P>
<P>
Both Riordan and Coliseum private management negotiator Irving Azoff said no 
progress has been made in efforts to resume discussions with Raiders owner Al 
Davis about keeping the team in Los Angeles.

CLEAR, CRISP SKIES DUE SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fog that enshrouded most of the Southland's coastal and intermediate 
valleys the last few mornings will probably be back again today, but 
forecasters say the overcast should begin moving out on Saturday, and that by 
Sunday the weather should be crisp and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Fog forced the diversion of several flights from Ontario International Airport 
before dawn on Wednesday, and at least one flight was diverted on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service issued a heavy fog warning Thursday morning for 
inland highways, especially in the western San Bernardino Valley, but the 
California Highway Patrol said there was no apparent increase in traffic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times, said the fog has been the result of a stationary low-pressure 
system stalled off the coast that has been pumping cool, moist marine air 
inland during the night. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said this weather system should begin moving east this morning, 
bringing with it a "good chance" of light drizzle in coastal, foothill and 
mountain communities late tonight and early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The weather system should be well to the east by Sunday morning, which should 
dawn clear and cool with good visibility, the forecaster said.

Police said four people were arrested for rioting in Karachi, capital of Sind

first political detainee of Bhutto's 10-month-old government. 
</P>

A member of China's national swimming team who fled from Hong Kong on Oct. 4 
said he plans to remain in the United States until his country "settles down." 
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang, 20, told a news conference here Thursday that he has no immediate 
plans to seek asylum in the United States although he supports the 
pro-democracy movement. He said his main wish "is to return home once the 
country settles down and there is freedom and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Yang said that, although he never was politically active in China, he was one 
of the approximately 1 million demonstrators in a pro-democracy rally in Hong 
Kong after the June 4 retaliation against dissident students at Beijing's Tian 
An Men Square. He said his participation in the rally could lead to persecution 
if he returns to China. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has a visitor's visa that his attorney said could be extended for 
a year or more. Yang said he plans to learn English and participate in 
conferences about China.

Was it a missing piece of evidence from a recent cop-slapping trial in Beverly 
Hills?

<P>
Paul Roberts, an instructor at Santa Monica College, was mowing the lawn in 
Santa Monica the other day when he came upon a license plate with a 3-letter, 
3-digit message. 
</P>
<P>
The letters on the plate spelled out: ZSA. 
</P>
<P>
However, a check of the state Department of Motor Vehicles reveals that it was 
last registered to a Santa Monica resident. It was never, apparently, the 
vanity plate of a Hungarian celebrity/Rolls-Royce driver.

While some students of Southern California's culture have declared that the 
Valley Girl phenomenon has passed, Kimberleigh Richards disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Valley Girls are still alive and well," says Richards. "We just aren't the 
same ones that Moon Zappa sang about." 
</P>
<P>
Richards' Valley Girls group, based in Woodland Hills, is a 2-year-old 
organization of transvestites -- men who on occasion dress like women. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to reach out to cross-dressers who are scared to death that what 
they're doing is wrong and that they are the only ones who do it," said 
Richards, who publishes a monthly newsletter, Cross-Talk. 
</P>
<P>
Transvestites "face real problems" appearing in public in some parts of the 
country, Richards said. "Fortunately in L.A., it's not that big a deal." 
</P>

Forty years ago this week, Tinseltown's most famous sign underwent a drastic 
change. And pranksters weren't responsible. Instead, it was the Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce, which decided to refurbish the crumbling HOLLYWOODLAND 
sign and update it by lopping off the LAND. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark, built in 1923, originally wasn't associated with the movie 
industry. Instead, as author Richard Alleman points out, it "represented the 
one Hollywood business that is -- and always has been -- even bigger than show 
biz: real estate." 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywoodland development was advertised as being "above the traffic 
congestion, smoke, fog and poisonous gas fumes of the Lowlands." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like the Lowlands could be hard on the eyes and lungs even in 1923.

JUDGE LIMITS DAMAGE AWARDS IN CERRITOS AIR CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE RULING MAY SAVE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MILLIONS IN PAYMENTS TO VICTIMS 
OF THE 1986 DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision that could save the U.S. government millions of dollars, a 
federal judge Thursday ruled that Proposition 51 -- the so-called "Deep Pockets 
Limitation" initiative passed by California voters, limits the amount of 
damages that can be recovered from the 1986 Cerritos air crash in which 82 
people died. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon of Los Angeles ruled that Proposition 51 
applied to "non-economic" damages sought in about 75 cases stemming from the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling had been anxiously awaited by lawyers for the Federal Aviation 
Administration and plaintiffs -- including relatives of the deceased and 
homeowners who lost their houses in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The suits were filed after the Aug. 31, 1986, crash in which an Aeromexico DC-9 
jetliner collided with a small plane over Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a federal court jury in Los Angeles held that the FAA and the pilot 
of the small plane were equally responsible for the crash and absolved 
Aeromexico of any blame. The Justice Department then filed papers asserting 
that Proposition 51 applied to the case. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 51, passed by voters in 1986, held that in any personal injury or 
wrongful death lawsuit, where more than one party was at fault, the liability 
of each defendant for non-economic losses were limited to the percentage of 
fault that each party bore. Such losses include pain and suffering or loss of 
relations with one's spouse of children. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a party was 50% at fault, they would bear only up to 50% of the 
non-economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Proposition 51, if one of the parties had little money, the other 
defendant had to absorb the bulk of the damages, regardless of the percentage 
of fault. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 51 did not alter the way that economic damages -- such as loss of 
wages, medical bills and property damages -- are handled. Plaintiffs are still 
able to fully recover all those damages from the defendants, regardless of how 
much at fault they were. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's decision is of considerable significance in the Cerritos case because 
there is a vast difference between the resources of those who were deemed at 
fault. The estate of William V. Kramer, pilot of the small plane who died in 
the collision, has $1 million, while the federal government potentially has 
endless resources. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' lawyers asserted that the intent of Proposition 51 was only to 
reduce the amount of damages that could be recovered by a plaintiff who was 
partly at fault, not to limit damages to a party that was an innocent victim. 
But Kenyon disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the statute or the arguments given for and against its 
passage that would lead to the conclusion that Proposition 51 is inapplicable 
to cases involving an innocent plaintiff," Kenyon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that "the major purpose" of the initiative was to rectify a 
perceived inequity in the law that was costing California cities, counties and 
other government entities millions of dollars in personal injury lawsuits where 
they were only partly at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 51 was designed to "create a compromise" between the interests of 
an innocent plaintiff and a "deep pocket" defendant, such as a city, Kenyon 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He said if the plaintiff's argument prevailed, it would undermine the purpose 
of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"As one of the deep-pocket defendants that everyone is always trying to sue, 
it's important for the federal government that the court gave this 
interpretation to Proposition 51," said Steven J. Riegel, the Justice 
Department lawyer who handled the case.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTEL CONSTRUCTION BID IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city zoning administrator has denied a controversial request to 
build a 21-unit motel on Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington, saying the owners 
of the property have not properly maintained their existing motel on the same 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical condition of this place is absolutely deplorable," said Associate 
Zoning Administrator James Crisp in an interview Thursday, shortly after he 
turned down the application submitted by Chao-Ching Lee and his wife, Su-Yun. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Crisp said evidence showed that the 13-unit Crest Motel at 1104 W. 
Pacific Coast Highway was cited by police, who conducted an undercover 
operation in which they rented a room there after telling the motel clerk it 
would be used for prostitution. Knowing that, Crisp said, he could not in good 
conscience grant a conditional-use permit to Lee for redevelopment of the 
Crest. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents had also complained about the way Lee managed the motel. "Nobody 
had any faith or trust in him to keep this motel so that it would not become an 
eyesore in the community," said Wilmington community activist JoAnn Wysocki. 
</P>
<P>
The Lees, who may appeal the decision to the city Zoning Board of Appeals, 
could not be reached for comment.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NURSING HOME TO PAY FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bay Harbor Rehabilitation Center administrators have agreed to pay a $12,000 
fine and bring in a nursing consultant to settle civil charges of improper 
patient care at the center, a Torrance nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
From November, 1987, until January, 1989, county health inspectors reported a 
number of problems at the nursing home, including incorrect administration of 
medicine, failure to properly track patient conditions and poor hygiene, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Rod Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, in which the nursing home will pay a $1,000 fine each month for 
the next year, is not an admission of guilt, said Bay Harbor attorney Bob 
Gerst. The nursing home maintains that the charges were the result of differing 
opinions between inspectors and hospital employees about record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
The special consultant required by the settlement already works for the 
hospital under a contract to review nursing practices, Gerst said. Under the 
settlement, the consultant will submit written recommendations every 30 days 
for review by county inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said conditions at the nursing home have improved significantly since 
charges were first filed in October, 1988, and that county officials have given 
Bay Harbor a clean bill of health in recent inspections.

WEEKENDER: CREATIVE TOUR IN TORRANCE FINDS ART IN HISTORIC PLACES.

In 1926, the Madrid Market opened as one of the first mom and pop neighborhood 
markets in old Torrance. It became famous for its meat department, which drew 
customers from a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
By 1969, it had been long vacant and vandalized. That's when artist Connor 
Everts spotted the derelict market while driving by one day and thought its 
roominess and high ceilings would make it ideal for a studio. He's worked there 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Several blocks away, a 1930s-era factory building -- the last workshop of 
pioneer aircraft designer Edmond R. Doak -- also has become the domain of an 
artist. After Doak's death three years ago, stone sculptor Nick Agid took it 
over and makes art out of marble and onyx, and is surrounded by the tools, 
furnishings and memorabilia of Doak's aviation career. 
</P>
<P>
The two studios are high points on an "Art in Historic Places" tour being 
conducted Saturday and Sunday in old downtown Torrance by the Torrance 
Historical Society. A third major attraction is Kent Twitchell's 
20-foot-by-110-foot outdoor mural saluting six Los Angeles artists. He painted 
it 10 years ago on the wall of the Employment Development Department building 
on Engracia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Tour co-Chairman Janet Payne says she's not about to claim that Torrance is a 
booming center of working artists hidden away in old buildings. But, she says, 
the city has more of an art life than suggested by its image as a home of 
industry, suburban residences and one of the world's biggest shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of this tour is to show off a new area of interest, Torrance as an 
arts center, and to show that historic buildings are being reused," she said. 
In the case of the old market, Everts saved it from destruction because the 
dilapidated structure was being eyed by the city as a site for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The self-guided tour begins at the Torrance Historical Society Museum, which 
was originally a 1930s Art Deco-style library. At the museum, visitors will 
receive a brochure and map detailing the historic sites, including Irving 
Gill's Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge over Torrance Blvd. At 11 a.m. 
Saturday, the society will hold a ceremony honoring the bridge's recent listing 
in the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Everts and Agid will be at work in their studios during the tour and Twitchell 
will be at his mural Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell, who has done many highly visible murals around Los Angeles, painted 
a group of Otis Art Institute graduates for the Torrance mural. "Somehow," he 
said in an earlier interview, "it seems appropriate to put often-unemployed 
artists on the side of an employment office." Three of the six, he says, became 
quite successful after the mural was painted. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the weekend tour, the historical society museum will highlight 
artwork depicting city history. And to lend more flavor and authenticity, 
artists from the Torrance Traditional Artists Guild will set up their easels 
curbside to do paintings of the old downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Everts' studio will get little feel of the old market. Thick 
foliage hides the building now, the asphalt parking lot has become a garden, 
and Everts added a second story in the back to create living space and a 
well-lighted painting space. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ideal for a studio, deserted and quiet," said Everts, who is working on 
large new paintings for an upcoming show. They cover a wall of his studio. 
</P>
<P>
Agid's old factory building, on the other hand, retains the echo of aviation 
visionary Doak -- a man who employed 6,000 people when his aircraft company 
built training planes during World War II and who is most famous for a vertical 
takeoff plane he developed in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of his planes hang on the walls, along with decades-old group photos 
of aircraft executives, and even Doak's rack of pipes sits alongside his old 
desk. Alfred Perry, a former Doak employee who still calls his old boss "the 
chief," will be on hand this weekend as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
Agid's art space -- which he shares with metal sculptor Orell Christian 
Anderson -- is a cavernous room with a curving roof, large white wooden 
supports and big doors. He says it makes a good studio: "It has a high ceiling, 
the light is quite nice all around." 
</P>
<P>
He has done lighted onyx sculptures that bring out the colors of the stone. His 
current art project is a striking adventure in what one museum director called 
"stone mail." In an admitted act of self-promotion, Agid turned postal cards 
into art, mailing onyx "postcards" to museums and art galleries around the 
country. He asked for RSVPs and is at work duplicating the written replies on 
large slabs of marble. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the movers and shakers of art who got the stones were amused. But the 
post office, Agid said, "was not thrilled." Gerald Faris

GOVERNMENT GETS THE MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The majority of the people in United States who believe that the decision to 
have an abortion is a serious choice but still a deeply personal one should 
take comfort from two key legislative decisions this week. In both Florida and 
in Washington, legislators were willing to stand up and be counted against 
further restrictions on legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who called a special session of the Legislature in 
an effort to place limits on abortion, found himself in the embarrassing 
position of a drum major without a band. The one measure that received fairly 
broad support, a proposal that would have called for stronger state regulation 
of abortion clinics, will likely be reconsidered during the regular session. 
</P>
<P>
But the Legislature decisively spurned Martinez's attempts to impose several 
restrictions, including prohibiting public hospitals from performing abortions. 
The Legislature's action was particularly noteworthy because this is the same 
Legislature that just last year passed a law to require a minor to get the 
permission of a parent or a judge in order to obtain an abortion. But last week 
the Florida Supreme Court struck that down, based on the state's privacy law. 
</P>
<P>
In a hard-fought vote in Congress, the House narrowly approved a provision that 
extended government-funded abortions to poor women who have been the victims of 
rape or incest. The vote is an about-face from the policy that prevailed 
throughout the Reagan Administration. While there have been repeated attempts 
to restore federal funding for cases of rape and incest, a timid House has 
failed to do so until now. 
</P>
<P>
Some abortion-rights advocates say that the votes signal a major tide change. 
But President Bush has threatened to veto the House measure, which has been 
endorsed once by the Senate and is expected to be routinely approved again. 
Even if Congress can manage the difficult task of overriding a presidential 
veto, pro-choice advocates still face bruising battles this year in 
legislatures in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Texas, where anti-abortion 
supporters are expected to push a cluster of bills that will attempt to impose 
parental, spousal or partner consent and waiting periods on abortions. 
Certainly it is too early for pro-choice advocates to declare victory over an 
intractable controversy likely to continue for some time. 
</P>
<P>
But the votes in the House and in Florida do indicate that many Americans 
remain convinced that the right to an abortion is best left standing. The 
rejection of further limits is an acknowledgement that many voters have made it 
known to their legislators that they prefer to keep abortion legal and safely 
available to those who seek it.

WRITER'S CRAMP

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the California Legislature adjourned early in the morning of Sept. 16, the 
exhausted lawmakers got to go home and pretty much forget about legislation 
until January. But down at the governor's office, the work was just cranking 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian had less than two weeks in which to act on hundreds of 
bills passed by the Legislature in the rush to adjournment. In fact, 60% of all 
the bills passed this year went through in the final 10 days of the session. 
That is not the sort of pressure-cooker in which a governor should be forced to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
There is no problem at the conclusion of the second year of the Legislature's 
two-year session, when the governor has 30 days to act on bills. At the end of 
the first year, however, he has only 12 days from the point at which the 
completed legislation reaches his desk. Deukmejian joked about the chore: "In 
all, I signed or vetoed 1,741 bills this year and when you have to sign a name 
as long as mine, that can take a long time." 
</P>
<P>
He also asked for voter support of a constitutional amendment on next June's 
ballot that would give the governor 30 days in which to act on bills passed 
before recess of the first year of the two-year session. 
</P>
<P>
The gubernatorial review is critical to the legislative process, and 
particularly following the end-of-session frenzy when bills are almost 
literally pasted together following midnight negotiations. The governor's 
office is the last place to catch drafting errors or to spot onerous special- 
interest legislation that might have sneaked through the Legislature.

Conrad's depiction of Al Capone, the "Prohibition racketeers," embracing Al 
Capone, the "drug moguls," is disturbing ("All we do is supply a demand" -- Al 
Capone, Oct. 4). 
</P>
<P>
When the Volstead Act, prohibiting sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages 
was repealed, Prohibition racketeers were out of that particular business. 
</P>
<P>
The inescapable implication of Conrad's cartoon is the legalization of drugs. 
Even in jest, the implication is unrealistic and offensive.

Just say no to drugs? Who are we fooling? The message we send to our children 
via network TV, radio, billboards and magazines is more like this: Just say no 
to drugs unless you can't fall asleep. In that case, take a pill. Just say no 
to drugs unless you are constipated. In that case, take a spoonful. Got a 
headache, upset stomach, athlete's foot or piles? Go for the instant relief.

<P>
Want to be a real man, Sport? Then come to Marlboro Country and puff with all 
the macho dudes. Want to be popular? Want to pal around with the "in crowd?" 
Then you should know that the "Silver Bullet won't slow you down." And hey, by 
the way, kids, don't drink and drive . . . that's not why we sell beer at the 
gas stations!

MURDEROUS DRUG CARTELS ENDANGER THE CONTINENT; 
</P>
<P>
*PUBLISHING: 'WHAT IS AT STAKE IN MEDELLIN AT THIS MOMENT IS NOT JUST FREEDOM 
OF THE PRESS. IT IS FREEDOM ITSELF.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Augustin Nunez, Managing editor, O Estado de S. Paulo 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following is the text of an editorial which members of the InterAmerican Press 
Assn., including the Times, are publishing as a gesture of support for the 
Colombian daily El Espectador, the target of attacks by drug underworld. The 
102-year-old newspaper, Colombia's second largest, has been a leading critic of 
the drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 news media employees have been killed in Colombia in drug-related 
violence over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Two El Espectador managers Tuesday, and drug barons threaten further attacks 
if the newspaper does not stop publishing in Medellin, Colombia's second 
largest city and hub of cocaine smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 El Espectador owner Luis Caro, in Monterrey, Mexico, for the IAPA meeting, has 
said he will not bow to the threats. His brother, Guillermo, was assassinated 
for anti-drug crusading three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in the dirty war waged by drug traffickers in Colombia 
against the institutions of that country confirm that the audacity of criminals 
knows no bounds. It suggests, too, that drug merchants will not hesitate to 
extend the range of their victims -- up to now limited to authorities and 
journalists who dare combat them -- in their effort to bring the Colombian 
goernment to its knees and oblige it to stop enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
The terrorist arrogance of the drug trafficking cartels showed itself in an 
especially brazen way last Tuesday. In the space of just a few hours, two 
persons on the staff of the newspaper El Espectador of Bogota were murdered by 
gunmen at the service of the drug cartels. The bodies of the victims were still 
lying in the strets when the drug trafickers delivered their threat literally 
to blow up Medellin if El Espectador did not close its plant there and withdraw 
its staff within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The terror claimed by the drug cartels on the Colombian free press has no 
parallel in the history of the continent. The dictatorships and authoritarian 
regimes that afflicted Latin American nations for so many decades always made 
independent journalists priority targets. But not even the most freedom-hating 
governments have tried to institutionalize the systematic extermination of 
journalists who defend laws and institutions as the colombian criminals are 
trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, not even the bloodiest civil war provides a precedent for one of the 
combatant groups blowing up an entire city. 
</P>
<P>
The threat hanging over Medellin, the latest chapter in a long history of 
horror that includes the brutal executions of journalists, military judges, a 
justice minister and a candidate for the presidency, strengthens the suspicion 
that the drug-traffic cartels have managed to infiltrate institutions in 
Colombia to terrible effect. Despite the efforts of President Virgilio Barco, 
the truth is that none of the chiefs of the murderous cartels is in jail and 
subject to extradition, the legal threat that prompted the drug traffickers to 
unleash the current wave of terrorism in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
As ever, the impunity of the criminals can only be explained by the fact that 
their circle of friends includes men in strategic positions of power in the 
government, police and even the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly for the American continent, Colombia is not the only country in which 
press freedom is suffering a variety of restrictions. That same Tuesday, the 
wife and son of Luis Fuentos, assistant city editor of El Diario de Hoy of El 
Salvador, were shot at in the streets of the capitol. Neither in Panama nor in 
Cuba is there any room for independent journalists. As reports from the various 
countries represented at the IAPA General Assembly, which opened Monday in 
Monterrey, Mexico, show, the Americas, seen as a whole, are far from enjoying 
the high level of civilization -- and there is no civilizaiton without free 
press -- achieved in other regions of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
That distance may be increased even more if the Colombian drug traffickers 
continue acting outside the law, a situation that transforms the drama taking 
place in Medellin into a cause of concern for the whole continent. The drug 
business involves a whole host of criminals throughout virtually the entire 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The drug traffickers' ultimate aim is to neutralize the State -- by seizing 
power or making government officials their cohorts, as in Panama, to thwart 
reaction by the healthy part of society. Following the somber examples set by 
their likes in Medellin and Cali who act against a background of omission or 
impotence on the part of the Colombian government, gangs of murderers in other 
nations will feel tempted to copy their methods. That is why it is vital to 
immediately halt the advance of the cartels. 
</P>
<P>
What is at stake in Medellin at this moment is not just freedom of the press. 
It is freedom itself.

THE JAILED BECOMES THE JAILER; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: NELSON MANDELA IS STILL BEHIND BARS, GAINING STATURE, WHILE 
PRETORIA'S TALK OF REFORM REMAINS UNCONVINCING. BUT FREED, HE COULD PROVE TO BE 
A PEACEMAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY HAZLITT HEARD, Anthony Hazlitt Heard, former editor of Cape Times in 
Cape Town, South Africa, is a visiting international fellow at the Fulbright 
Institute, University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, the world's most celebrated prisoner, was pointedly left out of 
Pretoria's little list this week of those to be released from jail. The 
omission will raise Mandela's stature as never before. 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues and co-accused in past campaigns and court trials now walk out 
of prison elderly men, like Walter Sisulu, 77, and Raymond Mhlaba, 69. This is 
no doubt part of President Frederik W. de Klerk's "equitable" reform plan for 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In September, De Klerk said that the goal was to reach a stage, as soon as 
possible, where "all South Africans will, in a just and equitable manner, 
become part of all the decision-making processes in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Such rhetoric is the easy part. The hard part is to put flesh on the bones of 
reform, and in a way that will not collapse De Klerk's already rickety white 
power base. As it is, half of the Afrikaners -- the traditional strength of his 
National Party -- do not support him, as the Sept. 6 general election showed. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been in jail longer than his colleagues. He was already serving an 
earlier term when he and his colleagues went to jail for life in 1964. He has, 
in all, served 27 years for crimes of sabotage that he planned but did not 
execute after the suppression of his African National Congress organization in 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, those who opposed South African war efforts against Hitler and the 
country's pro-Nazi activists were released from life imprisonment for murder or 
treason in 1948, when the Afrikaner Nationalist government came to power. They, 
of course, were white Afrikaners, not black nationalists, and Afrikaners were 
now in charge. The justice minister at the time offered the excuse, in letting 
them out, that the government wanted to forget the divisions of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
If ever there was a time to forget divisions, it is now. This is particularly 
so in view of De Klerk's reform talk and the fact that Mandela did not indulge 
in sabotage and killing. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's new deal will mean little while Mandela remains in jail, while the 
African National Congress and its rival organization, the Pan African Congress, 
remain banned, the state of emergency continues and South African exiles crowd 
other shores. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if the South African government regards Mandela as too big a fish 
to let loose just like that. He is obviously to be part of continuing power 
plays. He may be a valuable bargaining lever in the hands of Pretoria. But with 
the announcement that his colleagues are to be released, he sticks out like a 
sore thumb. 
</P>
<P>
An optimistic assessment would be that Pretoria is planning a wide-ranging 
diplomatic push to get meaningful negotiations under way, and that Mandela will 
be released when and if these are ready -- perhaps with the help of Britain's 
Margaret Thatcher after the coming meeting of Commonwealth heads of government. 
</P>
<P>
Those who think that Mandela is unimportant, an elderly has-been who can be 
discounted, are, I believe, mistaken. Few countries' histories produce such 
powerful political assets (such living martyrs) in a conflict. He is a young 70 
and keeps himself fit. 
</P>
<P>
The longer Mandela is in jail, the more his world and local acclaim must 
increase. The government's problem is that when Mandela is released, the 
acclaim will not necessarily slow down. The best they can hope is that he will 
then start making the mistakes of free men. Up until now, he has been spared 
this by his incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
The government's incapacity to resolve the Mandela issue, for fear of the 
public response when he is released, has in effect turned Mandela into the 
government's jailer. I have watched over the years as Mandela's files in 
newspaper libraries have grown fatter -- even rivaling those of Winston 
Churchill and other notables. This has happened despite his convict status and 
the fact that he could not be seen (in photographs) or heard. 
</P>
<P>
Streets, rock 'n' roll groups, parks, buildings and so on are named after 
Mandela in world capitals and also in South African townships and universities. 
Books are written about him; films are made, statues erected. 
</P>
<P>
President Pieter W. Botha, De Klerk's predecessor, was a stubborn man. He could 
have let Mandela loose before his stature reached these heights. The best Botha 
could do, as he left office, was to invite Mandela to tea. 
</P>
<P>
The National Party government has in effect become a Mandela image-builder. It 
should cut its losses. It is time for Mandela's release. With his standing 
among blacks, and even among whites -- and his potential influence on young 
black militants -- he can play a crucial peace-maker role in negotiations. The 
country is fortunate that he has survived so long.

HOW A MERE HUMANIST WON THE WORLD SERIES POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. FOGELIN, Robert J. Fogelin is Sherman Fairchild professor in the 
humanities at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. He was a fellow at the center 
in Stanford last year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year I, a mere humanist, won the World Series pool at the Center for 
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford. Since the World Series 
once again approaches, I thought I would share the reflections behind my 
stunning accuracy in picking the Dodgers to win the series, and then predicting 
within three the total number of runs scored. (I said 35. The actual total was 
32.) 
</P>
<P>
My reasoning went something like this. It was obvious that Oakland should win 
last year -- so obvious, in fact, that everyone was likely to pick Oakland. 
Given this, the winner of the pool would be the person who came closest to 
predicting the total number of runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Since I had no better idea how many runs would be scored than anyone else, the 
chances of my winning with such a strategy seemed slim. So even if I had little 
chance of winning by picking the Dodgers, I decided that I had a better chance 
of winning by picking them instead of the almost-certain winner, the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first stage of my reflections. I then realized that I was 
surrounded by very intelligent colleagues, many of whom knew neat things about 
probability theory, statistical analysis, meta-theoretic strategies for 
decision under uncertainty and heaven knows what else. 
</P>
<P>
These very intelligent colleagues would obviously reason just as I did, with 
the result that everyone would pick the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to fool them by picking Oakland after all. 
</P>
<P>
Then I realized that my very intelligent colleagues would see this, too, 
reverse their positions, and everyone would go back to betting on Oakland. 
Could I fool them by reversing my position one further time and betting on the 
Dodgers? Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
I came to the conclusion that there was no rational way to pick which team to 
bet on. The deciding factor was that I grew up near New York City and was a 
Brooklyn Dodger fan as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
Now, about the aggregate number of runs: Having chosen the Dodgers, it seemed 
to me that they could win onlyin a low-scoring series. So I staked out the 
bottom end of the scale with a ridiculously low number. As it turned out, it 
was not as ridiculous as the actual number. 
</P>
<P>
After making my bet, I saw that my reasoning was deeply dumb. Even if the 
Dodgers won four low-scoring games, there was a good chance the Athletics could 
win up to three high-scoring games. 
</P>
<P>
What I should have done was look up the total runs scored in the Dodgers/Mets 
playoffs and then tack on a few extra runs because the Athletics are a somewhat 
better-scoring team than the Mets. Those few at the center who picked the 
Dodgers in the pool seemed to have adopted this plausible strategy -- with the 
result that they lost and I won. 
</P>
<P>
I won the World Series pool the way the Dodgers won the World Series: for no 
apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are about to place a wager in a Giants-Athletics World Series 
pool, I suggest that you follow your instincts and put your faith in Pascal's 
thought: "The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of."

NORIEGA FOES DIDN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF DEMOCRACY; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: THE ABORTIVE COUP WAS ENTIRELY A MILITARY MATTER. NEXT TIME, THE 
CITIZENRY WILL HAVE A WINNING ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By I. ROBERTO EISENMANN JR., I. Roberto Eisenmann Jr. is the editor of La 
Prensa, Panama's newspaper of record, which has been closed and occupied by 
Noriega's troops. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we were informed very early on the morning of Oct. 3 that shooting had 
erupted at command headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, a group of 
Panamanian exiles met and started making calls to our country. Reports were 
very confused, but it was clear that a major coup attempt against Gen. Manuel 
Antonio Noriega was in progress. The action seemed to be concentrated at 
headquarters, which led one to assume Noriega was inside, for the headquarters 
building is not necessarily the most important military garrison. Since troops 
on the outside were shooting inward, it was clear that this was a battle 
between loyalists and rebel troops. It was also clear that there was 
cooperation by U.S. troops, which secured Ft. Amador (a joint base), locking in 
Noriega troops, as well as Ft. Clayton, the Bridge of the Americas and the 
Avenue of the Martyrs. 
</P>
<P>
Then the rebels' first and only communique was read on Radio Exitosa. As we 
listened, our concern deepened. Normally, plotters in Latin American military 
institutions make all sorts of promises to draw support from as many 
constituencies as possible. Typically, they say that the coup is to "restore 
democracy," "clean up corruption," "respect human rights," "restore justice," 
"respect the will of the people through clean elections," "protect against 
foreign ideological penetration," "produce change," and so on. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the communique, signed by Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega and Capt. 
Javier Licona, was totally different from the norm. It began by proclaiming a 
"return to Torrijismo," which in essence meant "no change," just more of the 
same with different faces. It then said that it would respect the present 
government -- the puppet government installed by Noriega. Democracy was not 
mentioned once, nor was justice. The communique stated that this was purely a 
military operation with absolutely no political ties -- in other words, a clear 
disconnection from the people's movement for democracy. It then listed those 
officers who would be retired, starting with Noriega; it did not include any of 
his gang. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, this coup would have condemned the people of Panama to 
"Norieguismo" without Noriega -- to a change so that nothing changes. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the relief of getting rid of Noriega -- in Panama, internationally 
and in the United States -- would have been so great that voices of concerned 
democrats would have been drowned out. The Administration in Washington would 
probably have gone back to business as usual with the Panama narco-military 
machine, as it would have a fresh face. After all, President Bush said "we have 
no quarrel with the PDF . . . it is Noriega we want out." God help us! we 
thought; the PDF has proven to any and all objective observers that it is a 
gang of thugs dressed in U.S. military uniforms with a different shoulder 
patch. This uniformed gang is incompatible with democracy in Panama. The people 
of Panama are not struggling for "stability" a la Noriega or a la Giroldi. They 
are struggling for democracy, which is their traditional form of government and 
the only true possibility for institutional stability. 
</P>
<P>
When we got final word that the coup had failed, there was -- incredibly -- a 
sense of relief. After this "victory," Noriega will have to face harsh 
realities. He is in a political vacuum, as last spring's election showed in its 
3-1 defeat of his candidates. His regime is completely isolated by the 
international community. His own military is fatally fractured. The coup 
leaders included the commanders of the units most loyal to Noriega -- the crack 
Special Forces (the unit in charge of headquarters security), the cavalry and 
the G-2 intelligence unit, which Noriega headed and nurtured for 14 years. As 
for age group, there were junior officers, mid-level officers and very senior 
officers -- a cross section of the total force. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who have battled for democracy in Panama for 20 years, this 
coup attempt was an unexpected bonus with a silver lining. The internal and 
external pressures will now multiply geometrically, pressing for legitimate 
democratic changes. 
</P>
<P>
The brief drama of Oct. 3 held many lessons for military and civilians alike, 
such as: A successful military coup requires the participants' decision to kill 
or be killed; they cannot depend on U.S. assistance; they must connect with the 
people's militant nonviolent movement, and the objective must be legitimate 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
We, the people of Panama, will persist in our democratic struggle, and we will 
soon prevail over narco-militarism, in spite of our friends.

LANGSTON FINDS THE LOCAL AREA ATTRACTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A whirlwind trip to Los Angeles this week only seemed to confirm Mark 
Langston's feelings that he would like to make Southern California a more 
permanent stop when he leaves the Montreal Expos soon as a free-agent pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
An amateur musician who plays a number of instruments -- "and is master of 
none" -- Langston satisfied those interests Wednesday by jamming with a good 
friend, pop star Bruce Hornsby, in the garage of Hornsby's Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
And that night, Langston watched the Kings play the New York Islanders at the 
Forum, then met Wayne Gretzky, who brightened the moment for Langston by 
telling the pitcher that he was one of the first players Gretzky picked for his 
rotisserie league team. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't say how his team did, but he could soon be rooting for Langston 
on a home-team basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind that at all," Langston said Thursday when asked about the 
possibility of pitching for Gretzky's hometown Dodgers. "He would be a great 
guy to pal around with." 
</P>
<P>
A budding friendship isn't the only attraction for Langston in Los Angeles, but 
neither is he closing the door on other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Eligible to file for free agency on the day after the World Series and having 
already rejected a three-year, $9-million offer from the Expos, Langston said 
he has eight teams in mind. 
</P>
<P>
They are the five California teams plus the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals 
and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Langston said it is too early to rank the eight or pinpoint preferences, but he 
does favor Southern California, meaning the Dodgers, Angels or San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Arn Tellem said he expects Langston to emerge as baseball's highest-paid 
pitcher and player -- if only on the basis of competitive bidding and economic 
appreciation since Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers signed his three-year, 
$7.9-million contract last winter, and Frank Viola of the Minnesota Twins 
matched it in April before his trade to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, however, if the threat of a labor lockout or strike might not depress a 
market in which Langston looms as the most attractive commodity, Tellem shook 
his head and said: "For Mark and the other top free agents, I think it will be 
a very active market. I think the clubs will look on it as a window of 
opportunity, a chance to grab the top players before the labor problems develop 
next spring." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who made $1.3 million this season, said his decision will be based on 
baseball and financial considerations, the most important aspect being the 
competitiveness of the club. The Dodgers, Angels and Padres satisfy that 
criterion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be on a contending club, a club that has a chance to win," he said. 
"I really feel that if the Expos had won, it would have left a different taste 
with me. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say I've ruled out the possibility of re-signing with the Expos, 
but I would have definitely been more interested if we had won." 
</P>
<P>
Langston, a 29-year-old left-hander who led the American League in strikeouts 
in three of his five seasons with the Seattle Mariners, was traded to the Expos 
on May 25 and compiled an overall record of 16-14, winning 10 of his first 13 
decisions with Montreal before losing six of his last eight, thanks in large 
part to illness, injury and lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
His earned-run average of 2.39 was the National League's third best, and his 
overall strikeout total of 235 in 250 innings was second in the majors to Nolan 
Ryan's 301. 
</P>
<P>
Langston has pitched 225 innings or more in each of his six seasons except 
1985, when he had an elbow injury. And while pitching for the hapless Mariners 
in the confining Kingdome, he won 19 of his team's 78 games in 1987 and 15 of 
his team's 68 in 1988. His 17 wins in 1984 were the most by a rookie 
left-hander since Gary Peters won 19 for the 1963 Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, pursuing a "win now" philosophy, traded three young pitchers for 
Langston, knowing he might leave at the end of the season. Langston said he was 
treated well by Montreal fans and looked at his future in that city with an 
open mind -- at least until the final six weeks of a season in which he thought 
the Expos were rolling toward a division title. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as if someone pulled the plug," he said. "Everything crumbled and I 
don't know why. We lost seven in a row to the Cubs and Mets and I still had an 
open mind, but I wanted to see how we rebounded and we never did. The situation 
kept getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos could be devastated now by the departure of several free agents, 
including Langston and Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Both are Californians who want to return, although Langston, who grew up in 
Santa Clara, said he will maintain his winter home in Seattle, no matter where 
he signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Being from California, there would be a nice sense of coming home," he said. 
"And I've always felt that when you step on the field in Anaheim or at Dodger 
Stadium, there's a feeling that this is what the big leagues are all about. 
Plus, you don't hear a lot of negative things from the stands like you do in 
other parks. The fans come to be entertained, and generally are. The quality of 
the organizations speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Langston's wife, Michelle, has studied acting, and Langston said he has 
relatives in the San Diego area with whom he gets together two or three times a 
winter to attend basketball and hockey games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had fun here. We've always felt very comfortable here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Does he have a preference to leagues? 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed the National League because I like to participate," he said. 
"I like to bat and run the bases. It brought back some boyhood memories. I even 
broke up a double play against the Cardinals. Jose Oquendo asked if I was all 
right, and I just laughed. It was fun again. 
</P>
<P>
"But I could also make an easy adjustment to the American League. I spent five 
years there. I know the league very well. I really don't think the question of 
leagues will be a major issue." 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that it will be, that aside from participating more in the 
National League, Langston likes the idea of pitching to a lineup devoid of a 
designated hitter in a league where pitchers work fewer innings because they 
are apt to give way to pinch hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, executive vice president of the Dodgers, refused to discuss 
Langston because of tampering restrictions. Sources close to the club believe 
Claire will pursue Langston as he did Dave Righetti and Gary Gaetti. 
</P>
<P>
Signing Langston would allow Claire to trade a young pitcher -- John Wetteland, 
perhaps -- for a center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels view Langston in a similar manner. "When you consider what we were 
prepared to pay Bruce Hurst and Nolan Ryan last winter, I'm confident we will 
be in the bidding for Langston," a club executive said. "We had a surprisingly 
good season but realize we have to build on it. We can't stand pat, 
particularly when you consider the quality of the opposition."

THE FANS REALLY GOT FIRED UP FOR STATE BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP IN 1860 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants square off to settle 
the baseball championship of California Saturday, it will have been 129 years 
since the state's first baseball title was decided. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 20, 1860, at the State Fairgrounds in Sacramento, the San Francisco 
Eagles met the Sacramento Red Rovers for the state's championship trophy, the 
Silver Ball. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fred W. Lange in his 1938 book, "The History of Baseball in 
California and the Pacific Coast League," that was California's first big game. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles won, 31-17. 
</P>
<P>
They scored a lot of runs in those days, split-fingered fastballs being quite a 
few decades down the road. And another important difference between the World 
Series games to be held in the Bay Area and those of baseball's early years in 
California was that in the old days, you didn't have to check your guns at the 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
It was considered good clean fun then to fire your six-shooter into the air 
just as a batter was getting ready to swing. 
</P>
<P>
William Shepard, an 1860s third baseman in San Francisco, described the 
baseball environment there in his memoirs, a rich source for Lange's book. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball was loosely organized, gambling was ever present, particularly when 
the Eagles played the Pacifics," Shepard wrote. "Gamblers would place bets on 
teams . . . and fire a fusillade from their six-shooters just as a fielder was 
about to make a play." 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that organized baseball's first year in California was 1859. The 
state's first taste of big league baseball was in 1869, and it wasn't pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
The sport was brought to San Francisco in 1858 by a newcomer from Boston, 
Martin F. Cosgriff. He had bats and balls, and showed the locals how to play. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, according to Lange, a group of "tradesmen and mechanics," led by 
John M. Fisher, founded the first team on the Pacific Coast, the San Francisco 
Eagles. On Washington's Birthday in 1860, the Eagles found someone to play -- a 
new team from Sacramento, the Red Rovers. 
</P>
<P>
The first game ended in a 33-33 tie, but the Eagles declared themselves winners 
by default when the Red Rovers stalked off the field angrily, citing "unfair 
pitching" by the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
In 1861, the Eagles brought in two ringers from the east, two brothers from the 
professional New York Knickerbockers, William and James Shephard. With their 
encouragement, a second San Francisco team, the Pacifics, was formed. 
</P>
<P>
There was little baseball during the Civil War, but in 1866 baseball people 
held a convention in Sacramento and formed a California State Convention of 
Baseball Players. A constitution and rule book were published, and a league was 
formed. The convention also resulted in the construction of the first enclosed 
ball park in California, at 25th and Folsom Streets in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The new league had its ups and downs but in time proved to be the forerunner of 
the California League, which later became the Pacific Coast League, which later 
gave way to major league baseball in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
In 1867, the Eagles played a new team in Oakland, the Wide Awakes. Final score: 
Eagles 37, Wide Awakes 3. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Eagle partisans were getting cocky. They figured their guys were ready 
for anybody. So an invitation was sent eastward, to the nationally famed 
Cincinnati Red Stockings, winners of more than 50 games in a row. And in what 
must have been one of the first cross-country trips by a sports team, the Red 
Stockings came to San Francisco on the new transcontinental railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Here it gets sort of ugly. In the first game, the Red Stockings beat the 
Eagles, 35-4. They played again the next day, and the Red Stockings won, 58-4. 
Two days later, it was the Pacifics' turn to lose to Cincinnati, 66-4. Finally, 
the California League put together an all-star team, but the Red Stockings beat 
that group twice, 46-14 and 50-6. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, the Red Stockings had louder revolvers.

CANSECO SAYS HE DOESN'T CARRY A'S, WIN OR LOSE

<P>
Whether the Oakland Athletics win or lose the World Series, Jose Canseco isn't 
going to let what others say get to him. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the A's won the West division by 13 games and then swept the 
Boston Red Sox for the American League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco led the way, becoming the first major leaguer to hit 40 homers and 
steal 40 bases in one season. Canseco and the A's seemed invincible. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1 of the World Series, Canseco hit a grand slam in the second inning at 
Dodger Stadium to give the A's a 4-2 lead but Oakland went on to lose that game 
and the Series in five. 
</P>
<P>
And after his slam, Canseco went 0 for 19. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who says I lost that World Series doesn't know what they're talking 
about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco says it's important for him to play better in this Series against San 
Francisco but that it's not a life-or-death situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pay attention to what people say anymore," Canseco said. "That's one 
thing I have learned. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is nothing. What's baseball when compared to death? What's baseball 
when compared to starvation? It's a game. I could go 20 for 20 or zero for 100. 
It's still a game." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco is heading for the $4-million season category soon. 
</P>
<P>
He has the ability to turn a crowd on, and turn the opposition off with one 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
The focus in the World Series against the San Francisco Giants will be the 
matchup of Canseco and Mark McGwire against Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hot," Canseco said of Clark. "Everything he hits is falling in. If we 
stop Clark and Mitchell, we have a pretty good chance." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson said he would go back to the New York Yankees for the right 
money, but his preference is to remain with Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, the most valuable player in the American League playoffs, will 
become a free agent after the Series. 
</P>
<P>
After spending 3 1/2 seasons with New York, Henderson was traded back to 
Oakland on June 20 for pitchers Greg Cadaret, Eric Plunk and outfielder Luis 
Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson hit .247 with the Yankees with 25 steals. With the A's, he hit .294 
with 52 steals in 58 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off to a bad start," Henderson said. "The weather was bad and we had a 
different second-place hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he did not request the trade and was disappointed when it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It was, 'Let's blame Rickey' if things didn't fall into place," Henderson 
said. "I had a great time in New York. I would consider going back, but I hope 
I'm back here." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell showed up at the Giants' workout in San Francisco, admitting 
that he deserved a fine for missing Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong -- I missed practice," Mitchell said. "It's no big deal. "I've got 
to pay a fine, and the case is closed." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' left fielder, who led the major leagues with 47 home runs, was 
upset by the publicity his absence created. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too big of a deal -- this, all this," he said, gesturing to the crowd of 
about 100 reporters and photographers surrounding him at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The annual debate over whether the designated-hitter rule will play a role in 
the Series is raging again. When the Series opens in the Oakland Coliseum, 
teams will use a designated hitter. When the Series switches back to San 
Francisco for Games 3, 4 and 5, the Oakland pitchers will be forced to bat. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us another bat in the lineup," San Francisco's Will Clark said. "I 
think it will hurt Oakland more because their pitchers aren't used to batting. 
Hopefully they'll be an automatic out." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up an interesting problem. Does Giant Manager Roger Craig take 
pitcher Don Robinson out of the order? Robinson hit three homers this season 
while Ernest Riles, Craig's choice for DH, hit seven.

FOR USC'S O'HARA, DREAM GOES SOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dream began every night as Pat O'Hara dozed off. 
</P>
<P>
He was hunched over center on a bright, warm afternoon, calling signals. The 
ball slid easily into his hands, and he began to roll left, looking for a 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
But something was wrong. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't seem to get 
out of slow motion. As he neared the sideline, he turned to look for his 
favorite target, John Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Jackson to be found, and an uneasy feeling began to come over 
O'Hara. The play is taking too long, he told himself. Something's going to 
happen. Do something! Do something! 
</P>
<P>
If only he could get out of slow motion. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate by this time, aware of trouble bearing down on him, he got rid of the 
ball as if it were a hot potato, tossing it into the void. 
</P>
<P>
Too late. He felt an incredible force, like a careening car, crash into his 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
He sat up straight in bed, trembling, his sheets soaked in sweat. 
</P>
<P>
He looked down at his knee, aching from the reflexive actions caused by the 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
Then he looked around. He was in a hospital room. His nightmare was real. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly two months since O'Hara suffered a season-ending, 
knee-shattering injury in a USC intrasquad scrimmage at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last full scrimmage before the season opener, and O'Hara, after 
waiting three years for Rodney Peete to graduate, appeared to have won the job 
as starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
But a few plays into the scrimmage, O'Hara rolled left and was hit by several 
players just after letting the ball go. He hit the ground screaming, ligaments 
in his right knee torn and the tibia broken. 
</P>
<P>
"A week before the game," O'Hara said, "you're wearing a gold jersey in a 
scrimmage, which means you're not supposed to be touched. Someone comes out 
flying and puts a helmet right on the outside part on my knee. It's real hard 
to deal with. Now, it's just me and my knee." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, it was thought that several linemen had been inadvertently blocked 
into O'Hara, but he doesn't buy that theory. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so," he said, "because my foot didn't get caught underneath 
anybody and twist. It was a direct hit. I don't blame anybody. Sometimes people 
make mistakes or get a little too excited. I don't think anybody did it on 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't eased the pain, either physical or emotional. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot of bitterness inside me," O'Hara said. "It's not directed 
at anyone in particular. It's just bitterness. Sometimes, it comes out 
verbally. Sometimes, I snap at people and that's not me at all. Why do I say 
those things?" 
</P>
<P>
It was not just the injury, but all of the circumstances surrounding it that 
made the incident so bitter for O'Hara to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara arrived at USC after a brilliant career at Santa Monica High School. 
Peete was at the controls, so O'Hara dutifully put in his time on the scout 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a challenge, mentally," O'Hara said, "putting up with that for two 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Then along came Todd Marinovich, the pride of Orange County prep football, to 
challenge for the role as Peete's successor. 
</P>
<P>
"People told me, 'Oh, you should transfer,' " O'Hara said. "Everybody was 
talking about, 'Todd, Todd, Todd.' I had been here two years, waiting my turn, 
and everybody was telling me Todd was going to be the future. 
</P>
<P>
"No way I ever thought about transferring. That's not me. I felt if I had left, 
it'd be a cop-out. I'm not one to quit or cop out of anything. If I'd left, I 
never would have known if I could have competed or beat him out." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, O'Hara worked out all spring and summer. He ran under the direction of 
track coach Jim Bush. He threw, sometimes twice a day, with Jackson, completing 
passes, reviewing patterns, perfecting timing. 
</P>
<P>
And it seemed to have paid off. Coach Larry Smith indicated that O'Hara would 
be his starter against Illinois in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summertime, I would dream about playing," O'Hara said. "I was so 
excited. It seemed too good to be true. I don't know, maybe it was an omen or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Even after O'Hara's dream had turned into a nightmare, the horror wasn't over. 
He immediately underwent surgery to repair the torn ligaments, but even after 
he got home several days later, the pain persisted. 
</P>
<P>
He would lie on the couch in his parents' Santa Monica home and cry from the 
pain. Finally, he called his doctor, Richard Diehl, and asked, "Am I a wimp or 
something? I can't take this." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a lot more than just being a wimp. A bone chip had slipped 
and was resting on a nerve. The solution was a second surgery to graft a bone 
from the hip into the damaged area to secure it. 
</P>
<P>
More pain. More recovery time. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get out of bed for four weeks," O'Hara said. "I lost 30 pounds. I 
was on all these drugs. And then when I got off the morphine, I actually went 
through this withdrawal period. I was on morphine for only four days, but I was 
getting it every three hours. And after a while, it didn't work. I needed even 
more, and they couldn't give me any more." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara is back in school now, and in the apartment he shares with his roommate, 
linebacker Brian Tuliau. Tuliau waits on him at home and drives him to school. 
Once there, O'Hara gets around on crutches or one of the many carts on campus. 
</P>
<P>
His days are long. After class, he goes in for rehabilitation. Then he works 
out with weights to get back his strength and the pounds he lost. By the time 
practice is over and Tuliau can drive him home, night has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest thing for O'Hara was going back to the Coliseum to watch the 
Trojans, who have won four consecutive games under Marinovich since losing 
their opener. When O'Hara was on the sidelines before, he was watching Peete, 
confident he'd get his chance. Now he must watch Marinovich, knowing he may 
never get a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy for Todd, but I'm human, too. I could lie and say it doesn't 
bother me at all, him being Pac-10 player of the week two weeks straight. But 
deep down, it kind of hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Many have tried to soothe the hurt. O'Hara has gotten a mountain of letters, 
including ones from former President Reagan, ex-USC coach Ted Tollner and his 
high school coach, Tebb Kusserow. O'Hara's parents and sisters, Carole and Kim, 
have offered support. Smith's wife, Cheryl, has talked about how she lived with 
her own career-ending injury, a back problem that cost her the chance to be a 
professional dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, O'Hara has maintained the same resolve he showed while waiting 
the past three years. "I'm going to work hard, going to work my rear end off to 
get my knee back to where it was," he said. "The doctor told me I should have a 
stable knee. I'm just going to have to wear a knee brace." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara is still several weeks away from even being allowed to bear weight on 
the injured leg and walk on his own. He hopes to be running by spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to come back for my fifth year," he said, "and give it everything I 
have. I don't expect to come in and be a starter. I don't even know if I'm 
going to be back for spring football. The doctors say they are not sure. I 
think I'll be able to drop back and throw routes, but in terms of scrimmaging, 
I don't think the doctors will let me do that. I'll just come back next year 
and do whatever I can. I don't know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
The nightmares have long since gone, but in the quiet moments when he is alone, 
O'Hara stills searches for an explanation for that dark day. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you think someone is punishing you for something you did," he said. 
"Sometimes you say, 'If I hadn't done this bad thing, or that bad thing . . . ' 
But you can't think like that, that you deserve this. It's torture. Things like 
that happen, and unfortunately, it happened to me. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I had it right here in the palm of my hand. Such a great team, and you 
wait so long to play. Finally, you get the chance and it's just taken away from 
you."

First-round draft pick Sean Elliott ended his holdout from the San Antonio 
Spurs Thursday and signed a five-year contract reportedly worth $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited to get it all over with," said Elliott, the No. 3 pick in last 
June's draft. "I knew all along that I'd be a Spur." 
</P>
<P>
The team did not announce terms of the agreement, but sources said the 6-foot-8 
forward from Arizona would receive $1.8 million a year, or $9 million over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The speculation has been extremely accurate," said Bob Woolf of Boston, 
Elliott's attorney who negotiated the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott signed in time for the Spurs exhibition season opener Saturday against 
Milwaukee in San Antonio. Asked if Elliott would play, Coach Larry Brown 
laughed, "Until his tongue hangs out."

GAMES BEGIN AND DIVAC COMES TO PLAY; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: YUGOSLAV ROOKIE IS SURPRISED BY ALL THE FUSS. 'THAT WAS A TYPICAL GAME 
FOR ME,' HE SAID THROUGH AN INTERPRETER.

<P>
In his National Basketball Assn. exhibition debut Wednesday night, Vlade Divac 
of Yugoslavia showed that he has almost no conception of how a Laker center has 
traditionally played. 
</P>
<P>
One does not run across the court just to steal a pass. One does not get 
flattened by a bulky forward to draw a charging foul. One does not outrun the 
guards and fill the lanes on fastbreaks. And one does not, as an unspoken rule, 
dive headlong out of bounds for a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
But Divac did all that and more in the Lakers' 115-94 pounding of the 
Sacramento Kings, much to the pleasure of Laker coaches and the surprise of the 
crowd of 4,896 at Blaisdell Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Laker center emeritus, may have done some of those things 
at some point in his career, but certainly not in the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Kareem dove for loose balls, too," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "Kareem 
made it out on the break. Maybe not when he was 42. But when he was 21, he did. 
Sure, he did." 
</P>
<P>
Although the quality of the competition may have had something to do with 
Divac's success -- the woeful Kings used journeymen Greg Stokes and Ben Gillery 
at center for most of the game -- the 21-year-old former Olympian scored 12 
points and had eight rebounds in 23 minutes. He made five of eight shots, had 
three steals and blocked one blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
It was not as if the Lakers thought Divac incapable of such a performance. It 
was just that he did not show signs of such advanced development during the 
five days of practice preceding the first of the Lakers' eight exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"(General Manager) Jerry West made a great statement afterward," Riley said. "I 
said to him, 'God, where was he in practice?' And Jerry said, 'There's no 
daylight in practice.' And he was right. Vlade got out there on the open court 
in a game, and he had room to move." 
</P>
<P>
Divac did not just move, he stalked, dived and sprinted. 
</P>
<P>
After being accustomed to the rather sedentary movements of Abdul-Jabbar in 
recent seasons, the Lakers took a while getting used to Divac's play. But Riley 
and his players definitely liked it, and the crowd roared its approval. 
</P>
<P>
"He adds a lot to our team, a new dimension," said Magic Johnson, who had 16 
points and six assists in 23 minutes. "We're gonna run up and down, wild and 
crazy this year, and Vlade can do that. He can run the floor, score from the 
outside, be aggressive rebounding-wise, and he's a big body." 
</P>
<P>
Since this was only the first exhibition game -- the Lakers played the Kings 
again Thursday night at 9:30, PDT, before returning to Los Angeles -- Riley did 
not want to overstate Divac's play. He clearly was impressed, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know where his strengths really are," Riley said. "I think the 
work he did with Kareem (in training camp) really helped him. In post defense, 
he's making a conscious effort to get in front of his man. He's doing things we 
like to see." 
</P>
<P>
But seeing a 7-foot-1 player diving wildly on the floor left many aghast. 
</P>
<P>
Divac, speaking through translator Alex Omalev, did not know what all the fuss 
was about. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, I would dive for all loose balls," Divac said. "That's Yugoslavian 
basketball. That was a typical game for me. I have to use my assets, (such as) 
running speed. That's the advantage I have over slower centers." 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Riley has Divac third on the Lakers' depth chart at center behind 
Mychal Thompson (eight points, five rebounds Wednesday night) and Mark McNamara 
(one point, five rebounds). But he could find little fault in any of his 
centers' play. 
</P>
<P>
"They all give us something different," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Divac's only faux pas came in the fourth quarter. After a King knocked the ball 
out of bounds under Sacramento's basket, Divac picked it up and sprinted to the 
far sideline to inbound it, apparently forgetting that he was not playing under 
international rules. 
</P>
<P>
The referee asked for the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Injury updates: Guard Byron Scott, who has been trying to shake the lingering 
effects of his torn left hamstring suffered before the NBA finals last June, 
scored 14 points in 24 minutes and reported no discomfort. "It felt good after 
I got it warm," Scott said. "At the start, I could feel it a little. But six 
minutes into the game, I got going." . . . Forward Orlando Woolridge was 
expected to test his sore and swollen right knee in Thursday night's game. If 
the swelling in Woolridge's knee returns today, when the Lakers fly home 
briefly before going to Knoxville, Tenn., for an exhibition game, Woolridge 
would probably skip the trip and undergo exploratory arthroscopic surgery. . . 
. Free-agent forward Mel McCants, who had four points and six rebounds 
Wednesday night, was poked in the left eye midway through the fourth quarter 
and did not return. . . . A 6-foot-8, 250-pound rookie free agent who has 
impressed Coach Pat Riley, McCants wore a patch over the eye Thursday and was 
to be examined before determining his availability for the second exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Larry Drew, the former Clipper recently signed by the Lakers, 
missed all five of his shots but impressed Coach Pat Riley with his 
ballhandling and passing. Drew led the Lakers with seven assists in 27 minutes. 
"Larry ran the offense well," Riley said. "He's still trying to learn a new 
system." . . . Forwards James Worthy and A.C. Green, both of whom reported to 
camp in excellent shape, according to Riley, led the Lakers with 19 and 16 
points. . . . Michael Cooper, who played small forward as well as at both guard 
positions, scored nine points. He made both three-point shots he attempted. . . 
. As planned, the Kings' Ralph Sampson played only 14 minutes because of sore 
knees. Sampson made one of six shots, had five rebounds and blocked four shots. 
The Kings shot 38.7%, compared to the Lakers' 43.8%. Forward Rodney McCray led 
the Kings with 17 points. Guard Danny Ainge made just three of 10 shots and had 
seven points and five turnovers.

C'MON, HOWE HAS HAD ENOUGH COMEBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gordie Howe said Wednesday he would like to wait until his 11-year-old grandson 
makes it to the National Hockey League so that he can make another comeback and 
play with him, just as he made a comeback to play with his sons, Mark and 
Marty, until he was past 50. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say his grandson, Travis Gordon, is at least seven years away from the 
NHL. Howe would be 68 then. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy? Is it any crazier than the talk about him coming back at 61 to play on a 
line with Wayne Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, he was joking about the grandson comeback? 
</P>
<P>
So what? This whole furor over his comeback started out as a joke. Or at least 
as teasing. He mentioned it first at the Hall of Fame dinner to Richard Gordon, 
owner of the Hartford Whalers, the team he last played for and the team he 
still works for. Back East, the first flurry of stories concerned a one-game 
comeback with the Whalers after New Year's, so he could claim to have played in 
six decades. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon originally thought it sounded like a good idea, but then started to back 
off. Gordon was quoted in the Hartford Courant as saying: "I haven't thought 
about all the ramifications. It reminds me of, 'What's a person's last wish?' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do what's right for Gordie. We've got to discuss this with the 
general manager, the coaching staff and the players." 
</P>
<P>
And when the idea was compared to the publicity stunt that Chicago White Sox 
owner Bill Veeck pulled when he sent a midget up to bat, Gordon said: "Are you 
saying I'm turning the greatest hockey player into a midget?" 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to pass off Howe's one-game comeback as an attempt to improve 
a team and win a hockey game. It wouldn't exactly be a publicity stunt, but it 
would be more ceremonial than serious. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon turned the matter over to NHL President John Ziegler for consideration 
regarding questions of "roster, insurance and league image." 
</P>
<P>
When Howe arrived in Los Angeles to await Gretzky's breaking of his scoring 
record, he joked in the locker room that he would like to make the one-game 
comeback after New Year's and "challenge the little guy to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings, asked if he would let Howe play for his team, 
said it would be a fun thing to do, that the fans would enjoy it, that it would 
be an honor for the Kings and that he would like to "accommodate" whatever Howe 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Webster of the Kings said it was "a nice idea to try to do something 
for this man who did so much for hockey." 
</P>
<P>
Through the league, Howe's wife, Colleen, called it "a fantasy which will be 
given some further thought." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has said that if Howe wants to extend his five-decade record to six 
decades, he needn't bother. "I think five decades is a safe record," Gretzky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With his idol sitting at his side Wednesday, Gretzky was asked how he would 
feel about playing with Howe again. Gretzky said: "If there's anyone who can 
play at this age, it's Gordie. People say, 'He's 61.' But believe me, I know he 
can take care of himself out there. If Gordie wants to play, I'm sure he can 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Howe has said much the same thing, sort of: "I wouldn't want to just stand out 
there. How does John Candy look on blades? If I get there, Walter Gretzky 
(Wayne's father) would probably want to suit up, too." 
</P>
<P>
Next: Will Walter Gretzky skate with Wayne or wait until Wayne has a son, and 
the grandson learns to skate? 
</P>
<P>
The first NHL game pitting Soviet players against one another occurred Tuesday 
night in New Jersey, and the Calgary imports ended up on the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
This was no surprise to Viacheslav Fetisov, one of the two Soviets on the 
Devils. Fetisov said of Calgary's Sergei Makarov, who won the Soviet League 
scoring title nine of the last 10 seasons and who started his NHL season with 
two goals and eight points in three games: "He's a player the same caliber of 
Mario Lemieux or Wayne Gretzky. He's one of the strongest offensive players in 
the world today." 
</P>
<P>
Fetisov and Makarov played together on the Central Red Army team. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, New Jersey Coach Jim Schoenfeld concluded: "We're a better team 
with the Soviets. So are (the Flames). Especially with Makarov, a damn good 
hockey player." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Liut lost his ranking as Hartford's No. 1 goaltender last March, so his 
start Wednesday night against Washington was his first in more than six months. 
Peter Sidorkieweicz started the first two games of the season, and Kay Whitmore 
started the third. In the Whalers' fourth game, Liut made 24 saves as they beat 
Washington, 4-1. It was hailed as a turning point in his 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Ray Ferraro said: "Lootie was kidding that never before has 24 saves 
evoked such a round of enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Whaler Coach Rick Ley said he does not like a three-goalie system. "We have to 
give all three a chance," he said. "But if one guy gets hot, he could become 
the man. We'll have to make a decision by the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first week of NHL competition, the Whalers' Ron Francis was 
the league's points leader. His response: "Scary, isn't it? Quick, draw me a 
finish line before the other guys catch up." Francis has never had even a 
100-point season. . . . Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur had three goals in his first 
three games with Quebec. . . . Defenseman Doug Crossman, who played in 10 of 
the Kings' 11 playoff games and then was let go in the trade for goalie Kelly 
Hrudey, is the Islanders' leading scorer with eight points in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago defenseman Dave Manson was suspended for three games by the NHL for 
inadvertently knocking official Ron Asselstine to the ice during a tussle with 
the Rangers, after Chris Nilan poked Chicago goalie Alain Chevrier in the mask 
with his stick. Manson argued that he didn't even see Asselstine: "I only had 
eyes for Nilan." Blackhawk General Manager Bob Pulford was amazed by the 
three-game suspension and will be watching to see if everyone who touches an 
official this season gets hit with three games. By the way, Manson will be back 
just in time for the Blackhawks' rematch with the Rangers Tuesday night.

SKIPPER OF SOVIET BOAT APPARENT SUICIDE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The skipper of the Soviet Union's entry in the Whitbread Round the World Race 
was found hanged in a tree in Punta del Este, Uruguay, the first stop in 
sailing's premier ocean event. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Alexei Gryshenko committed suicide. Two notes were found in 
his pockets, one asking his wife and parents to forgive him. 
</P>
<P>
Gryshenko, 43, had organized the first Soviet bid in the quadrennial race but 
was due to return home for unexplained reasons after the first leg from 
England, in which the 82-foot sloop Fazisi placed sixth among 24 boats. 
</P>
<P>
John Jourdane of Long Beach, the navigator aboard New Zealand entry Fisher 
&amp; Paykel, said by phone Thursday that Gryshenko had said "he felt 
inadequate, compared to Skip Novak, who is extremely experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Novak, an American, was co-skipper of the Soviet boat, which is expected to 
continue. The United States has no entry. 
</P>
<P>
Jourdane said Gryshenko was found "in a tree about a mile from the boat. They 
actually showed it on (local) television . . . him hanging from a tree." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lutz, a Los Angeles schoolteacher aboard the English entry Liverpool 
Enterprise, said: "It sent a little tremor through the fleet . . . upset 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said of Gryshenko: "He was an introvert, 
a reserved man who spoke little. He took close to heart all problems connected 
with the project, even those that did not relate to him. He expressed regret 
that he was unable to fulfill the role of captain adequately. This testifies to 
the fact that he suffered a nervous breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
Steinlager of New Zealand won the first leg, followed by Merit of Switzerland 
and Fisher &amp; Paykel. The second leg of the 32,932-nautical mile race will 
start Oct. 28, from Punta del Este to Fremantle, Australia.

ANOTHER U.S. TEAM WILL COMPETE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently undaunted by the possibility of being banned, another group of 
American athletes will depart next month for a series of track and field meets 
in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The group, calling itself Athletes for Peace, will compete in five meets 
co-sponsored by the South African Transport Service and Topsport, a sports 
television network. Last October, 17 athletes and coaches competed in four 
meets in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
All those connected with that tour were suspended by The Athletics Congress, 
which governs track and field in this country, for periods ranging from two to 
12 years. The bans were the first of their kind in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
That tour marked the first time since 1962 that American athletes defied 
international bans against competing in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the tour stress the humanitarian aspects of the trip, but the 
world's sports community -- including the International Olympic Committee -- 
has long excluded South Africa from participation. Because of South Africa's 
policy of apartheid, or racial separation, the country has not competed in the 
Olympics since 1960 and was expelled from the IOC in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
TAC rules prohibit its members from competing in South Africa or against South 
Africans anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Still, tour organizer Dick Tomlinson said it has been easier to recruit this 
time because the athletes know they will lose their eligibility if they make 
the trip. Last year, there was uncertainty as to possible penalties. That may 
have accounted for the tour including mainly athletes near the end of their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who participated were former javelin world record-holder Tom 
Petranoff and Olympians John Powell (discus), Carol Cady (discus), Ruth Wysocki 
(800 and 1,500 meters) and James Robinson (800 meters). 
</P>
<P>
Those who went on the tour said the meets were fully integrated and they were 
allowed freedom of movement within the country. Tomlinson said this year's tour 
will include clinics in black homelands and in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson, a former coach from Live Oak, Calif., said all athletes who went 
last year were given a first right of refusal to return. He said most are 
returning to form a group of 20 athletes and coaches, of whom 11 are black. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Chriss, special assistant to the executive director of TAC, said he is 
aware of the impending tour and is exploring legal ways to prevent it. There is 
also reportedly a move among athletes in South Africa to organize an internal 
boycott of the meets. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the meets coincides with a meeting of the Supreme Council for 
Sport in Africa in neighboring Mozambique. The council is expected to discuss 
calling for a boycott of the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, in 
response to the tour of South Africa by a New Zealand rugby team. 
</P>
<P>
One problem Tomlinson encountered this time was the budget, which last year 
enabled the tour organizer to promise athletes $10,000 a meet and included 
performance bonuses. Attendance was disappointing, however, and Trek Petroleum, 
which sponsored the tour, reportedly lost money. 
</P>
<P>
The budget this year is significantly less. "I don't have enough money," 
Tomlinson said Thursday. "I can't expect people to face certain termination of 
their standing for a pittance. I have to make it worth their while." 
</P>
<P>
Gert LeRoux, director of the South African Amateur Athletic Union, confirmed 
that the meets will take place. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely planning it," he said from Pretoria. "The first tour was a 
success. Getting that kind of major sponsorship is not easy. But the main thing 
is to get competition for our athletes." 
</P>
<P>
The group leaves Nov. 2, and the meets are Nov. 7 at Germiston, Nov. 10 at 
Bloemfontein, Nov. 14 at Stellenbosch, Nov. 18 at Potchefstroom and Nov. 21 at 
Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the start of the track and field season in South Africa, and to 
ensure the highest levels of competition, officials have added an incentive. 
The highest honor that can be bestowed upon a South African athlete is to be 
awarded the Springbok colors. However, the colors can be won only through 
international competition. Because of the secrecy and unofficial nature of last 
year's tour, those meets could not be used for Springbok qualification. 
</P>
<P>
The first three meets will be used to select the South African team. The final 
two meets will be the Springboks against the Americans. The meets are being 
advertised in South Africa as the first international series since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Because of its official policy of racial separation, South Africa has been a 
sports outcast. The country has not competed in the Olympic Games since 1960, 
and worldwide, athletes in many sports are restricted from competing in South 
Africa or against South Africans.

Japan Trade Surplus Shrinks: Japan's trade surplus shrank for the fifth 
straight month in September, but economists said the trend could stall if a 
stronger dollar accelerated growth in Japanese exports. Japan's September 
customs-cleared trade surplus fell 6.7% to $7.24 billion from $7.76 billion a 
year earlier, the Finance Ministry announced. Industrial machinery and office 
equipment exports were particularly strong. The drop in the trade surplus was 
smaller than many analysts predicted because exports rose a surprisingly strong 
4.8% from a year earlier to $24.29 billion.

QINTEX MAKES NO MOVE TO REVIVE MGM/UA PROPOSAL; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: NBC EMERGES AS A POTENTIAL INVESTOR IF THE AUSTRALIAN OUTFIT CAN 
REVIVE ITS BID FOR THE FILM AND TV COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The fate of MGM/UA Communications Co. remained unresolved Thursday as the 
Australian Qintex Group made no effort to revive its collapsed $1.5-billion 
deal to acquire the entertainment company, a Qintex official said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Wallace, chief financial officer of Qintex America, said Thursday night 
that "categorically" there has been no effort by any Qintex representative to 
patch up relations or revive the bid, which Wallace said would have included 
the financial participation of NBC as one of 10 investors. Likewise, MGM/UA has 
made no effort to contact Qintex, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's lead attorney did not return a telephone call, but one of his partners 
-- Andrew M. White -- was quoted by Reuters news service as saying that MGM and 
Qintex were "in communication" although he added, "Based on where we are right 
now, there are no grounds for optimism." 
</P>
<P>
An NBC spokesman confirmed that the television network had recently struck a 
verbal agreement with Qintex to participate as an investor, although the 
spokesman, Joseph Rutledge, declined to say just how much the company was 
prepared to chip in. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge also declined to say how NBC planned to cope with federal rules that 
restrict the major networks' role in owning or distributing programming to 
local TV stations. "That's the $64 question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the NBC executive insisted that the company is not trying to use the 
investment as a "trial balloon" to test politicians' reaction to a network 
investing in a studio. Rutledge noted that since last November, NBC has held an 
option to acquire up to 15% of Qintex Australia Ltd., which owns Australian 
Television Network. 
</P>
<P>
An MGM spokeswoman declined to say what role -- if any -- NBC might play in 
reviving MGM/UA's interest in a sale to Qintex. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA terminated the planned sale to Qintex earlier this week after the 
Australian company failed to deliver a $50-million letter of credit due on 
Sept. 22. The non-refundable payment was a key condition of a sweetened Qintex 
bid in September that topped a cash offer from media mogul Rupert Murdoch and 
Fox Inc., the entertainment company he controls. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Chairman Barry Diller said Thursday that he personally is not eager to bid 
anew. "Life for me has moved on," Diller said. "I'm not foreclosing any future 
development. However, one thing I have realized is how many opportunities exist 
in the Fox company and deserve full-time development." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had viewed the bid as a Murdoch-driven move to acquire the valuable 
United Artists film library, which could help supply Murdoch's far-flung 
television holdings, which include a new satellite-delivered television service 
in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
For a similar reason, a securities analyst privately speculated Thursday that 
cable television entrepreneur Ted Turner might be interested in acquiring 
MGM/UA -- principally for the United Artists library -- if the price appeared 
reasonable. But the analyst acknowledged that Turner might meet resistance from 
cable television operators on his board, who gained their seats after they 
helped bail Turner out of his financial dilemma after he bought the MGM film 
library in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA shares rose 37.50 cents to close Thursday at $20.375 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On the Australian Stock Exchange, Qintex closed unchanged at 45 cents 
(Australian). 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading in the United States, Qintex Entertainment Inc. 
rose $1.25 a share, closing at $5.25, after losing $1.625 a share the previous 
day. The company is a television production unit that is 43% owned by Qintex 
but is not directly involved in the bid for MGM/UA.

SAUDIS TO RAISE OIL GOALS FOR 1990S, INVEST BILLIONS

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, plans to spend $15 billion in 
the next six years to maintain its supremacy in the oil market, regional 
bankers and oil industry analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia wants to remain a market leader in the 1990s," one oil industry 
manager said. "It also does not want its share within OPEC to erode as world 
demand grows." 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry sources in the Gulf said the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco) 
wants to push the kingdom's oil output capacity to 10 million barrels a day by 
1995 from the current 6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the company was expected to finance the scheme from oil 
revenue. Because the payments would be spread over a number of years it would 
not create any strain on its budget, they added. 
</P>
<P>
One industry executive predicted that the Saudis could reach an 
8-million-barrel-a-day output capacity by 1992 under the scheme. Current Saudi 
output is estimated at 5.2 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Gulf members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expect their 
world market share within the 13-nation group to rise by the turn of the 
century, in line with a projected increase in world oil demand and a decline in 
production elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia's plan to expand output was a clear 
warning to some of its OPEC partners, and to independent producers who might be 
planning expensive oil development schemes beyond the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you contemplate a new investment in the North Sea if you heard the 
Saudis will double what they are producing now by 1995?" an oil industry 
executive said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia reached the 10-million-barrel-a-day mark in 1980 and 1981, just as 
the rise in oil prices to $40 a barrel turned the world off its addiction to 
cheap oil. 
</P>
<P>
But as demand plummeted, Saudi Arabia's oil production dropped to as low as 
3.04 million barrels a day in 1985, at the cost of a permanent loss of capacity 
at some fields, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Aramco is already recruiting workers and staff for the new expansion 
scheme at its headquarters in the eastern province of the kingdom where its 
vast oil fields are located, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Aramco opted for a development scheme scattered over a long period," one 
industry executive said. "The job could have been completed in a shorter 
period, but the costs would have been much higher." 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry sources said the scheme would bring some older field equipment 
back into operation, increase recovery rates at some fields and probably 
develop some new fields. 
</P>
<P>
As its production capacity grows, there will be no problem of exporting the 
crude because the kingdom's existing oil loading facilities have a capacity of 
14 million barrels a day, Oil Minister Hisham Nazer recently said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Aramco plans to shoulder most of the development project but may use some 
specialized international oil industry service companies during the six-year 
program, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first phase of the project bringing back into production existing 
machinery will be quick and cheap," an oil industry source said.

Pitting their wits against competitors from some of the Southland's major 
universities, Caltech engineering students took first prize in the Collegiate 
Technology Challenge held Thursday at Universal City. The contestants were 
asked to build a contraption that would inflate a 16-inch globe. Caltech's 
winning entry included a couple of old shoes, an aquarium and the usual number 
of chutes, lines and pulleys, but ultimately used liquid nitrogen to compress 
the air needed to fill the globe. The winners share a $10,000 scholarship from 
competition sponsors, the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The contest 
was part of the firm's 1989 Technology Network Exchange conference.

Corn Crop Up 51% From Year Ago: The Agriculture Department reported that 
farmers are harvesting a corn crop estimated at 7.45 billion bushels, up 51% 
from last year's drought-plagued harvest of 4.92 billion bushels. Moreover, the 
latest estimate, based on Oct. 1 field surveys, was almost 2% more than the 
7.32 billion bushels forecast a month ago. At 7.45 billion bushels, the harvest 
would be the largest since the 8.25 billion bushels of 1986.

The price of AMR Corp. stock rose marginally Thursday amid reports of possible 
interest by Ft. Worth billionaire Robert Bass in buying the parent of American 
Airlines. Meanwhile, another report said AMR's chairman held talks with the 
company's pilots union about a possible buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that aides to Bass had indicated the 
secretive investor might be willing to help AMR fend off New York developer 
Donald J. Trump's $7-billion offer for the Ft. Worth-based company. Bass 
officials refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported in its Friday editions that AMR Chairman 
Robert L. Crandall met with American Airlines' pilots union about a buyout that 
would include significant participation from that union and the machinists and 
flight attendants unions. 
</P>
<P>
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, AMR rose $1.625 a share 
to close at $98.75 as 1.6 million shares changed hands. On Wednesday, the price 
had fallen $4.25. 
</P>
<P>
The share price remained well below the $120-a-share price offered by Trump.

FORD SELLS OFF ROUGE STEEL, CREATES HOLDING COMPANY

Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it agreed to sell its Rouge Steel Co. to an 
investor group that includes a retired chief operating officer of Weirton 
Steel. 
</P>
<P>
Few details of the deal, including the price, were released. Ford Vice 
President Peter Pestillo said he hoped that the deal could be completed by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the auto maker said it has formed a holding company to dull the 
potential tax sting of its pending acquisition of the Associates finance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the move can't be determined precisely, but an analyst says it may 
be worth millions to the nation's most profitable auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of Ford Holdings Inc. and the sale of 25% of it for $800 million 
to institutional investors should deflect some of the taxes related to Ford's 
acquisition of Associates, Ford officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated procedure involving seldom-used provisions of the 1986 tax law 
and foreign tax credits, Ford is avoiding the potential taxes by owning less 
than 80% of the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors about the potential sale of Rouge have been circulating for years, 
intensifying in the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
Pestillo said Rouge Steel operations would continue "substantially as we know 
them today." He said he anticipated no change in size of the work force -- 
about 3,300 hourly employees and 750 salaried workers. 
</P>
<P>
A Ford statement said the auto maker signed the agreement with Marico 
Acquisition Co. Marico, formed solely for the acquisition of the 65-year-old 
steel-making business, is headed by Carl L. Valdiserri, the former Weirton 
Steel executive. Valdiserri could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and Marico would be among a small number of equity partners, Ford 
spokesman Bill Carroll said.

STOCKS DECLINE; DOW EXTENDS LOSS BY 13.52

<P>
Stock prices lost ground for the third straight session Thursday as traders 
warily awaited the latest government data on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 13.52 to 2,759.84, bringing its loss 
over the last three trading days to 31.57 points. The average hit a record 
closing high of 2,791.41 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 160.12 million shares, against 164.07 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 543 up, 907 down and 511 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates dropped in the credit markets. But analysts said stock traders 
had other concerns on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
The government is scheduled to report this morning on the producer price index 
of finished goods for September. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on Wall Street call for an increase in that measure of inflationary 
pressures of somewhere between 0.5% and 1%, reversing the downward trend that 
prevailed through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down 1/2 at 52; Philip Morris, 
down 5/8 at 44 3/8; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1 7/8 at 129 1/2; Eastman Kodak, 
down 5/8 at 47, and General Electric, down 1/8 at 58. 
</P>
<P>
Owens-Corning Fiberglas recorded one of the day's biggest percentage losses, 
falling 2 7/8 to 30 3/4. The company said its operating income for the third 
quarter would fall short of both analysts' estimates and comparable levels from 
the period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler lost 5/8 to 24. The company estimated its third-quarter results at 
around the break-even point, not counting an extraordinary gain from the sale 
of part of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors. 
</P>
<P>
Shares dropped sharply in Tokyo as investors took their cash out of equities 
following Wednesday's half percentage point rise in the discount interest rate, 
dealers said. The 225-share Nikkei average plunged 444.73 points or 1.26% to 
close at the day's low of 34,795.34. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, share prices advanced largely for technical 
reasons. The Financial Times 100-share index rose 19 points to 2,237.8. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bonds closed marginally higher but lost ground late in the session amid 
concerns about a possible oversupply of government issues on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond finished 1/16 point higher, or 62.5 
cents for every $1,000 in face value, after having been up 11/32 point in late 
afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
The bond's yield, which falls when the price rises, slipped to 8.04% from 8.05% 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds had moved moderately higher early in the session amid renewed 
expectations that the Federal Reserve Board would relax credit, allowing 
interest rates to fall and bond prices to rise, said William V. Sullivan, 
director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
A stronger dollar also contributed to the bond market's gains. 
</P>
<P>
But late in the day, the Resolution Funding Corp., the agency created to sell 
$30 billion in government notes to fund the cleanup of insolvent savings and 
loans institutions, said it would announce details of the bond issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
That, coming just a few weeks ahead of the Treasury's announcement about its 
next quarterly refunding auction, led to a selloff by bondholders concerned 
that too many issues on the market would depress the price of their holdings, 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds Wednesday, prices of short-term 
government issues rose 1/8 point to 3/16 point, intermediate maturities rose 
1/8 point and long-term issues rose 3/32 point, according to figures provided 
by Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.813%, unchanged from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell in subdued dealings. Gold prices rose worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $363.40 an ounce, up $1.40 from Wednesday. Republic National Bank of New 
York quoted a late bid for gold at $363 an ounce, $1.50 higher than Wednesday's 
late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Many currency traders also stayed on the sidelines while awaiting the release 
of retail sales and producer prices data for September. 
</P>
<P>
"If the producer price index comes in on the high side, the (Federal Reserve) 
won't have room to ease (interest rates) any further," said Bob Morrissey, a 
senior trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office. 
</P>
<P>
"While the Fed is concerned about the level of the dollar, their major priority 
is to keep inflation" down, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was undermined by speculation that the 
Fed was considering a cut in the discount rate, its interest charge on loans to 
member banks. Lower interest rates make U.S. investments less attractive to 
foreigners, thereby diminishing their need for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said 
that although the dollar is holding to key levels, the U.S. currency is likely 
to come under pressure because interest rate differentials have narrowed 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. interest rates are about 2.5% higher than those in Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the British pound got a boost from comments by Chancellor of the 
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who told the governing Conservative Party's annual 
conference that he would continue to fight inflation with high interest rates 
for as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose to 144.60 Japanese yen, from 143.90 yen. Later in London, the dollar 
traded lower at 144.25 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 144.15 yen, 
down from 144.50 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.5520, more expensive for buyers than 
Wednesday's late $1.5425. In New York, it cost $1.5527 to buy one pound, more 
expensive than $1.5460 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold traded late in London at a bid of $362.75 an ounce, up from $361.25 
Wednesday. The Zurich late bid was $363.10, up from $361.50. Earlier in Hong 
Kong, gold closed at $362.75, up from $361.25. 
</P>
<P>
Silver traded late in London at a bid of $5.10 an ounce, up from $5.05. On New 
York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed at $5.090 an ounce, up from 
$5.076 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork belly futures prices soared the permitted 2-cents-a-pound daily 
limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid growing supply fears rooted in 
the government's decision to ship pork bellies to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, copper and precious metals futures advanced, grains 
and soybeans were mixed and energy futures were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork belly futures settled 2 cents higher across the board with the 
contract for delivery in February at 49.72 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The rally followed a surge of buying on Wednesday and may reflect the market's 
uneasiness about the government's plan to ship $10 million worth of U.S. pork 
bellies to Poland as part of a food-aid package. 
</P>
<P>
Pork bellies are the part of a pig from which bacon is made.

JUNK BONDS FALL AFTER RAMADA WITHDRAWS OFFERING 
</P>

<P>
Junk bond prices fell sharply Thursday following Ramada Inc.'s withdrawal 
Wednesday of a $400-million high-yield debt offering -- the latest in a series 
of negative events to rock the already jittery market. 
</P>
<P>
The market responded dramatically to Ramada's announcement, with nervous 
investors selling off even the highest quality issues in the $210-billion 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a crisis of confidence in the market," said Bill Veronda, senior 
vice president of Financial Progams Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, junk bond prices fell 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 points, equal to $12 to $15 on a 
bond with a face value of $1,000. Since most junk bonds trade well below their 
face value, the actual losses were even larger. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ramada and its adviser, Salomon Bros., said the issues were being 
withdrawn due to unfavorable market conditions in the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market began weakening during the summer months when several 
highly leveraged companies were unable to meet interest payments. They include 
Integrated Resources Inc., Zapata Corp. and Seamans Furniture Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The nervous state of the junk market was exacerbated last month when Campeau 
Corp. announced that it would undergo a major restructuring and would miss 
interest payments on debt of its Allied Stores unit. Robert Campeau took over 
Allied and Federated Department Stores with huge quantities of junk bonds but 
has run into severe problems in making his debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Campeau debacle, tremors have continued to be felt throughout the 
junk market," one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although there is severe worry in the junk bond market, we have yet to see the 
bad news surface," said one analyst. He said "if a recession or an extended 
period of economic sluggishness occurs, we should see many more Campeaus." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the disparity in yield spreads between junk bonds and the highly 
liquid U.S. Treasury bonds is now at record levels of 600 basis points, or six 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonds are being hit hard by the liquidity situation," said Veronda, adding 
that "we're seeing a flight to quality." He said many investors are 
reallocating their holdings into the more secure U.S. Treasury market.

NORTHWEST ORDERS, OPTIONS JETLINERS WORTH $5.2 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Northwest Airlines said Thursday that it placed orders and options for 90 
jetliners worth $5.2 billion from Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Paul-based carrier said the largest aircraft order in its history 
consists of firm orders for six Boeing 747-400 long-range aircraft and 40 
Boeing 757-200 jetliners. The order also includes options for four more 747s 
and another 40 of the medium-range 757s. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, said the firm orders are worth 
about $2.7 billion and the options $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the airline, target of a $3.65-billion leveraged buyout led by investor 
Alfred A. Checchi, said it has not yet decided how to pay for the planes, which 
may be purchased or leased. 
</P>
<P>
In an LBO, investors borrow heavily to buy a company and use cash from its 
operations, and often asset sales, to pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines typically place small deposits with the manufacturer when making large 
aircraft orders to reserve "delivery positions" on crowded assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. airlines have been ordering planes at a record clip for the past few years 
to replace older jetliners and accommodate growing passenger traffic, 
particularly on overseas routes. 
</P>
<P>
The Northwest order is a blow to Europe's Airbus Industrie, which had 
previously won large orders from Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The first delivery of the new planes is scheduled for the second half of 1993, 
with all aircraft arriving by 1998, Northwest said. 
</P>
<P>
A Boeing official said it was too early to tell whether a 9-day-old strike by 
union machinists would affect delivery of the planes.

FIRE NEXT TO ACID TANK ROUTS 1,200; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: THE BLAZE AT ROCKETDYNE SENT 10 WORKERS TO HOSPITALS BUT OFFICIALS 
SAID HYSTERIA WAS TO BLAME FOR SOME INJURIES REPORTED BY OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,200 workers were evacuated Thursday morning when a fire broke out next 
to a 900-gallon acid storage tank at the Rockwell International plant in Canoga 
Park where space shuttle engines are built, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and doctors examined 57 workers who complained of feeling ill and 
sent 10, including three Rocketdyne firefighters, to area hospitals for 
observation and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the injuries, fire officials later said, appeared to result from 
hysteria felt by people imagining they suffered symptoms from exposure to toxic 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, in a 50-by-250-foot parts washing area at Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
Division in the 6600 block of Canoga Avenue, was spotted about 9:20 a.m. next 
to the acid storage tank. The fiberglass tank contained a highly toxic mixture 
of nitric and hydrofluoric acids and water that is used to clean stainless 
steel components for shuttle engines, company officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people working in the area at the time, but they got out right 
away," Rocketdyne spokesman Pat Coulter said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Boyd, manager of the area where the fire began, said he saw flames leaping 
as high as seven feet from the side of the tank and other workers said smoke 
from the fire spread through the ventilation system of the vast building, known 
as Building 001. 
</P>
<P>
Three firefighters from Rocketdyne's on-site fire department responded to an 
alarm and battled the blaze until Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters 
arrived minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was extinguished quickly, but officials were uncertain whether it had 
caused the tank to rupture and initially reported that as much as 900 gallons 
of the acid mixture had leaked. 
</P>
<P>
That report was contradicted after firefighters in yellow protective "moon 
suits" examined the area and determined that the tank had not ruptured but had 
merely been scorched. The only material that burned, officials said, was paint 
on the outside of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Had the acids escaped, "it could have been quite serious, because that is very 
potent material," said Inspector Ed Reed, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. "It could be lethal." 
</P>
<P>
Nitric acid vapor is highly corrosive to the skin, eyes, lungs and 
gastrointestinal tract and can cause fluid to build up in the lungs and, if the 
chemical is concentrated enough, death, said Frances Weindler, assistant 
administrator of the Los Angeles Regional Poison Control Center. Hydrofluoric 
acid is also highly corrosive to skin and mucous membranes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire is under investigation and a cause has not been determined. Assistant 
Fire Chief Alan Schroeder speculated that the blaze may have resulted from a 
chemical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
But Al Ybarra, president of United Auto Workers Local 887, which represents 
about 2,200 workers at Rocketdyne, said a union safety representative at the 
plant told him the fire was caused by acid that spilled on a wooden floor near 
the tank. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department dispatched 20 engine companies, three rescue crews and 85 
firefighters and called two additional private paramedic crews to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Workers examined by medical personnel complained of scratchy throats, 
dizziness, nausea and breathing difficulties. Four of the workers were sent to 
Kaiser Hospital Medical Center in Woodland Hills; four were taken to Canoga 
Park Hospital, and two went to the Nu-Med Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
All but one man, who was said by a spokesman at Canoga Park Hospital to be 
suffering from smoke inhalation, were later sent home. Schroeder said earlier 
that most of the injuries probably resulted from "hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Evacuated workers stood on nearby sidewalks for about three hours before being 
told they could go home. They strolled to nearby markets, sat on street curbs 
and speculated about the seriousness of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Most said that the evacuation had been quick and orderly and that employees 
followed procedures practiced in earthquake drills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was handled pretty smoothly, mainly due to the previous training 
that employees have had," said a man who complained of a sore throat after the 
evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
But Pat Thomas, who also works in Building 001, said many employees "can't hear 
the public address system" that was used to announce the evacuation and 
"weren't aware of what was taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Ford, a machinist in the building, said he was not overly concerned 
about the dangers of his job. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," he said. "I figure our environment is hazardous to our 
health. If I were worried about hazardous chemicals, I wouldn't be making the 
money I'm making." 
</P>
<P>
Worker safety inspectors from Cal/OSHA inspected the area Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1978 and 1986, Cal/OSHA inspected the facility a dozen times. 
Violations were found on three of those occasions, but details about the nature 
of the violations were not immediately available, a Cal/OSHA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire comes at a time when Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory, west of 
Chatsworth, is embroiled in controversy over its request to renew a license to 
handle nuclear materials. The license renewal is opposed by neighborhood 
activists and environmental groups that say the nuclear work is inappropriate 
in a populated area. 
</P>
<P>
Many merchants and customers of Topanga Plaza shopping center, across the 
street from the Canoga Park plant, said they were unaware of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you go there are hazardous materials in one form or another," said 
Tim Bekins, manager of a nearby market. "You can work next to a gas station and 
it can go up in flames. It's a sad situation, but you can't run from it." 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Sarka, a shopper who lives nearby, said she worries about the 
possibility of a major accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really think about it before," Sarka said. "I just hope the people we 
elected are doing their job, making sure that all the necessary safety measures 
are in place."

COURT UPHOLDS ORDER BARRING ABORTION LAW 
</P>

<P>
In a big win for abortion-rights groups, a state Court of Appeal on Thursday 
upheld an order blocking enforcement of a 1987 state law requiring unmarried 
minors to get the approval of a parent, guardian or judge to obtain an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
While not ruling directly on the constitutionality of the law, the three-member 
appeals panel refused to overturn a preliminary injunction by a San Francisco 
judge that barred implementation of the law pending a trial over its legality. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, relying heavily on the state constitutional right to privacy, said 
the trial court had not "abused its discretion" in concluding that opponents of 
the law were likely to succeed in their lawsuit challenging its legal validity. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal court noted that the abortion-rights lawyers challenging the law had 
offered considerable evidence that the statute would cause "increased stress 
and depression" among minors, strain parent-child relations and induce minors 
to obtain illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"There was evidence which indicates that all but a very few adolescent minors 
have the capacity for exercising mature judgment concerning the wisdom of an 
abortion," Appellate Justice William D. Stein wrote in a 24-page opinion joined 
by Appellate Justices John T. Racanelli and William A. Newsom. 
</P>
<P>
To support its ruling, the panel repeatedly cited the state constitutional 
right to privacy -- a right interpreted to be broader than the privacy right 
under the federal Constitution. A similar independent state right to privacy 
was cited last week by the Florida Supreme Court in striking down that state's 
parental consent law. 
</P>
<P>
And the panel made clear that state authorities will face a substantial task in 
defending the law in further proceedings. "Since (the law) will severely 
impair, or totally deny, the exercise of an intimate and fundamental 
constitutional right, the burden at trial will be upon the (state) to prove a 
compelling interest in the regulation of unemancipated minors' consent to an 
abortion," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court rejected contentions by lawyers for the state attorney 
general's office that the law should be upheld and allowed to take effect now. 
The panel disagreed specifically with the state's claim that minors, being less 
able to make mature and informed choices, were entitled to fewer privacy 
protections than adults. "California's Constitution . . . provides that the 
right to privacy is guaranteed to all persons," Stein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action means the ban on enforcement of the law remains in effect 
pending trial in San Francisco, unless the ruling is overturned by the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court, then under Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, issued a 
decision in 1981 in an abortion-funding case that recognized a broad right to 
abortion under the state right to privacy. Now, the court is led by 
conservatives, but it already has passed up one opportunity to review the 1987 
parental-consent law and has twice refused to consider appeals court rulings 
forbidding the Legislature to deny state-funded abortions to Medi-Cal 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Richard D. Martland, chief assistant attorney general, expressed disappointment 
with Thursday's ruling and said authorities would determine later whether to 
appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Martland also declined to forecast what the high court might do with such an 
appeal. "We just can't say at this point," he said. "I don't think we have 
enough of an indication from previous actions as to what the court would do." 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney added that meanwhile, a trial on the issue and further 
appeals by the losing side could take years before the issue is finally 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was warmly received by Margaret C. Crosby of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Northern California, one of the lawyers representing the 
medical and health provider groups that brought suit challenging the law. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was "especially reassuring," she said, in the wake of a ruling 
last summer by the U.S. Supreme Court that gave states more authority under 
federal law to limit abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"This ruling today forcefully reaffirms the California Constitution's right to 
privacy," Crosby said. "It really puts the state to a heavy burden of proof to 
support the law at trial. And until it can do that, teen-agers can continue to 
get abortions on a confidential basis -- and that's wonderful news." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion forces expressed hope that the state Supreme Court now will take 
the opportunity to uphold the parental consent law. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not expecting to have many victories in the lower courts, which are 
pretty much bound to past decisions," said Janet B. Carroll, legislative 
director of the California Pro-Life Council. "We want to be optimistic about 
the new high court, hoping it will rule in a different fashion than the Rose 
Bird court did. . . . We believe that 80% of the people in California and the 
rest of the nation favor parental consent laws." 
</P>
<P>
The eventual outcome will have wide impact in California, where an estimated 
35,000 unmarried minors receive abortions annually. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, such minors, 17 or younger, must obtain consent from a parent, 
guardian or judge unless there is a medical emergency. The statute mandates 
swift and confidential proceedings -- and requires judges to approve an 
abortion if they conclude that the minor is sufficiently mature and informed to 
consent to the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The law was challenged by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups 
in November, 1987, two months before it was scheduled to go into effect. In 
December of that year, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Morton R. Colvin 
issued the injunction preventing the statute from taking effect while its 
constitutionality was at issue in the courts.

RESCUE: POLICE IN A HELICOPTER SPOT A MAN WHOSE CAR PLUNGED DOWN A RAVINE IN 
FOG.

As a Los Angeles County Disaster Communications specialist, Edward Watts makes 
his living preparing for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
But he said his expertise failed to prepare him for the 10-hour ordeal that 
began Thursday morning when his truck went out of control on a fogged-in, 
unpaved stretch of Mulholland Drive in Encino and plunged and rolled 100 yards 
down a steep ravine, throwing him from the cab. He suffered a broken hip and 
deep cuts on his head and arms. 
</P>
<P>
The two ham radios that he keeps in his truck for major disasters were damaged 
in the crash. Even the two emergency drinking water canisters he carries turned 
out to be empty. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after hours of fruitless shouts for help, a Los Angeles police 
helicopter that happened to be passing over the area looking for stolen cars 
sighted Watts about 1:30 p.m. as he waved an orange towel from the crumpled cab 
of his truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter crew radioed for a police car and a Los Angeles Fire Department 
helicopter, which hoisted him aboard after firefighters on the ground placed 
him on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old West Los Angeles resident was in serious but stable condition 
Thursday night at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely thought I was going to die down there," a shaken but grateful 
Watts said from his hospital bed. "I was there screaming for help. I picked a 
very bad place to go over. There were no homes below me and not a single car 
passed by" on the isolated stretch of road in the 16900 block of Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
Watts said he was on the road to test the newly repaired rear axle of his 
truck. He said he also frequently goes to the area because the altitude 
provides better radio reception, which he uses to chat with other ham 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Watts was traveling at an unsafe speed -- about 35 m.p.h. -- when 
his truck skidded sideways over the edge of the road in thick fog. 
</P>
<P>
"It was foggy out there and the turns came up real fast, especially with 
inadequate lighting," Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck rolled several times and tumbled over him after throwing him out and 
into its path, authorities said. It came to rest on top of a rusty Honda car 
that apparently suffered the same fate several years ago, Los Angeles Police 
Officer James Van Riper said. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances were just as good that he would have gotten killed," said Fire 
Capt. Robert Hogan, one of the rescuing firefighters. "He might have just lain 
down there and died and we wouldn't have found him till someone spotted the 
car." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Randy Champe, the police helicopter observer who spotted Watts, said 
the wreckage caught his eye because he had not seen it the day before. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw an arm sticking out of the window, waving a T-shirt," he said. 
"Especially in that wreck, I didn't think anybody would make it out of there 
alive. That truck was just totaled." Watts said he tried to climb the 45-degree 
slope to the road but couldn't make it because his hip was broken. He said he 
tried in vain to send a Morse code distress signal through the microphone plug 
of one of the ham radios. 
</P>
<P>
He also tried with no luck to beckon the pilots of a small plane and a 
helicopter that flew over at low altitude. 
</P>
<P>
When Champe finally sighted him and shouted through a public address system to 
"Hang on, buddy -- the Fire Department is on its way," he said he gave a 
thumbs-up sign, thankful that his ordeal would soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
Watts said the experience will serve him well the next time he assists 
emergency victims on his job. 
</P>
<P>
"I have more insight and probably more compassion," he said. "And I'm going to 
get better emergency equipment in my car. And no more empty canteens."

IN SEARCH OF A MORE UPSCALE SCHOOL DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SIERRA MADRE PARENTS WANT TO SECEDE FROM THE PASADENA DISTRICT TO 
SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO MORE AFFLUENT ARCADIA. AN OPPOSING GROUP SAYS THE 
MOTIVATION IS RACIAL.

<P>
Should students be allowed to transfer from a poorer school district to a more 
affluent one? 
</P>
<P>
This controversial question is being debated in the San Gabriel Valley, where a 
group of parents from Sierra Madre are pushing a proposal to switch youngsters 
out of the Pasadena Unified School District and join the more upscale Arcadia 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
About 450 residents attended the first of two public hearings on the issue 
Thursday before the Los Angeles County Committee on School District 
Reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, marked by charges of racism, carries important financial stakes 
for the 22,000-student Pasadena district, which receives state money based on 
the number of students it enrolls. 
</P>
<P>
A group called Sierra Madre Parents for a Better Education wants its local 
elementary school, the Sierra Madre Elementary School, to secede from the 
Pasadena district and join the Arcadia district. Junior and senior high 
students attending Pasadena schools also would transfer to Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Those in solidly middle-class Sierra Madre who favor the plan say they have 
more in common with Arcadia, their affluent neighbor to the south. The parents 
say the Pasadena district has growing problems of drugs, gangs and violence, 
and that its students score in the bottom third on state standardized reading 
and math tests. 
</P>
<P>
Marc McMillan, whose three sons are enrolled in Pasadena schools, said Thursday 
he wants to spare his sons the poor education he believes they are receiving. 
</P>
<P>
"I want better for my children than what I had. I want them to receive a solid 
foundation for college," he said. "I have tried everything . . . short of 
moving my entire family. Nothing has worked. Now I support the only option I 
seem to have left. Let our children go." 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena district officials, and a group that opposes secession called All 
Children Count, said the Sierra Madre parents' fears are exaggerated and that 
the issue boils down to one of race. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of Pasadena Unified's students are from ethnic minorities. Anglos and 
Asians together make up a majority of students in Arcadia. Most of the Sierra 
Madre students are Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
George Van Alstine a Pasadena minister and community leader told the committee 
that secession would hurt efforts to ease racial tensions in Pasadena schools. 
"We feel it impacts the kind of progress we've made in Pasadena," he said. "The 
issue of race is there." 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education is not expected to rule on the issue until 
the fall of 1990. A spokeswoman said it is not uncommon for groups to attempt 
to leave one district and join another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's classic," said Susie Lange, public relations director for the department. 
"It's not uncommon for rich people to look at the neighborhood and say, 'I 
don't want to send my kids to the school there.' But if the impact is to 
further segregate one district at the expense of another, it will be denied." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Madre Parents for a Better Education denied the allegation of racism and 
said they merely want what's best for their children. 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena, which doesn't want any more defections, has authorized $25,000 
for an attorney to oppose the secession effort. A spokesman says the loss of 
Sierra Madre would lower the district's Anglo population by up to 30% in some 
schools and require significant redistricting to comply with federally mandated 
integration levels. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that Pasadena Unified would lose $1.8 million in state funds 
it receives based on the number of students enrolled. The loss would hurt 
existing school programs, said Bill Bibbiani, senior research analyst with 
Pasadena Unified. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia so far has remained neutral on the issue. But it says that its 
7,500-student school district could absorb the students. 
</P>
<P>
One variable is how many Sierra Madre students who attend private schools might 
cross over into Arcadia public schools if the redistricting drive is 
successful. Those favoring secession say there are 1,900 school-age children in 
Sierra Madre and that 1,200, including about 600 children in private schools, 
might move over into Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
But Arcadia officials are skeptical of that figure and say they need more 
information before deciding whether to support the secession. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say that even if the secession drive is successful, there 
won't be any changes until July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's hearing, organized by the Los Angeles Committee on School District 
Reorganization, is one of two state-mandated meetings to gather public 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
The next is scheduled for Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. in Arcadia, after which the county 
board has 90 days to make a recommendation to the state Board of Education. The 
state will probably take another three or four months to rule. If it finds in 
favor of redistricting, the issue will then go before voters, with election 
boundaries to be set by the state.

Pasadena Schools -- An article in Friday's editions of The Times about the

District incorrectly reported that 90% of the students in the Pasadena district 
belong to ethnic minorities. Enrollment figures for fall, 1988, the latest

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTOR TO STAND TRIAL IN 3-WAY MURDER PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale physician was ordered Thursday to stand trial on charges that he and 
two Ohio businessmen murdered a man to enable one of the businessmen to fake 
his own death as part of a $1-million insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard P. Boggs, 55, was ordered to stand trial on one count each of 
murder, conspiracy and assault with a stun gun, two counts of grand theft and 
four counts of insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay also upheld a special circumstance allegation of 
murder for financial gain, which means Boggs could get the death sentence if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
McKay's decision came at the conclusion of a one-month preliminary hearing. She 
dismissed one insurance fraud count because prosecutors did not present any 
evidence to support the charge. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Boggs to remain in custody without bail and to return to 
Superior Court for arraignment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Ohio businessmen, Melvin Hanson, 47, is in custody in Columbus, 
Ohio, fighting extradition to Los Angeles. The other man, John Hawkins, is a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
The three are accused in the death of Ellis H. Greene, 32, a North Hollywood 
man originally from Columbus whose body was found in Boggs's office April 16, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs allegedly misidentified the dead man as Hanson so that Hanson could fake 
his own death as part of an elaborate scheme to defraud his life insurance 
company.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TENTATIVE AGREEMENT FOR NURSES COMES UNDER 
FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tentative agreement that averted a nurses' strike at Los Angeles County-run 
clinics and hospitals was assailed by some members of the rank and file 
Thursday, leaving final approval of the proposed pact far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be voted down, but I don't know if it will be," said Beverly 
Footman, a nurse practitioner for the county. 
</P>
<P>
A vote on the proposed 17.25% pay raise over two years, originally set for 
today, was rescheduled until Monday to give union officials more time to 
disseminate details of the proposal to nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Footman complained that the proposed salary increase still leaves county nurses 
earning less than private nurses, making it difficult for the county to fill 
1,000 nursing vacancies. County nurses currently earn between $2,600 and $3,000 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative agreement on a new contract for 5,126 nurses was announced late 
Wednesday, averting a strike that had been due to begin at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the head of the nurses' bargaining team later indicated that final 
agreement is far less certain. The proposed two-year contract is being 
presented to the nurses for a vote without a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Pandora McDaniel, a nurse at a downtown clinic, said: "I don't feel it's a fair 
settlement. We're asking for 22% (over two years), and that's what we should 
get." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Chris Esqueda, a nurse at County-USC Medical Center, called 
the proposed agreement "pretty good" and said his fellow nurses were also 
pleased.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERS IN CAR DRAG VICTIM, RUN OVER HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A south Los Angeles woman was dragged for almost a block before being run over 
when robbers in the Wilshire area pulled her partly into their car while trying 
to steal her purse, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Orbelina Martinez, 28, suffered massive head injuries and fractured ribs 
in the Wednesday night incident, Los Angeles Police Detective Lester Slack 
said. Martinez was listed in critical condition Thursday at UCLA Medical 
Center, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who was on her way home after visiting friends, was waiting for a bus 
at Cambridge Street and Normandie Avenue about 5:30 p.m. when a mustard-colored 
car drove up to the curb and a passenger grabbed Martinez's purse, Detective 
Dan Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
She tried to tug the purse back but was pulled partially into the moving car 
through an open window, with the rest of her body dragging on the ground, 
Andrews said. After Martinez either fell or was pushed out, the car ran over 
her head and torso then sped west on Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police were seeking the driver and his alleged accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
The car was described as a 1980 to 1985 model Cadillac or Oldsmobile sedan with 
a missing rear license plate.

POLICE MAY HAVE SHOT ONE OF THEIR OWN DURING CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles police officer who was critically wounded while chasing four 
young men in a South Los Angeles neighborhood apparently was shot by other 
officers firing at one of the fleeing suspects, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Ward, a 31-year-old patrol officer, suffered bullet wounds to his back 
and right leg Wednesday night while searching for a suspect in a back yard in 
the 8000 block of Towne Avenue, according to LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William 
Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Ward was listed in critical condition Thursday at County-USC Medical Center 
after surgery that removed a bullet lodged near his spine. Hospital officials 
said they did not know if Ward, a 77th Street Division patrolman, would be 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said investigators swept the neighborhood with metal detectors and found 
no evidence that Ward was shot by any of the suspects, all of whom are in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to locate any weapons," Booth said. "The only shots we 
can confirm were shots fired by officers." 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that investigators have not ruled out the possibility that 
one of the suspects shot Ward. 
</P>
<P>
Police initially believed Ward had been shot by Darrin Davis, 20, a suspect who 
himself was wounded by police gunfire, according to Officer Neadie Moore, a 
police spokeswoman. Davis was treated at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center for two gunshot wounds in the upper thigh and was then turned over to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The four suspects were booked on suspicion of attempted murder of a peace 
officer, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore identified the other suspects as Johnny Jacko, 19; Jason Johnson, 18, and 
Johnson's 16-year-old brother, whose name was withheld because he is a minor. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday when officers from the Southeast 
Division tried to stop the suspects' yellow Oldsmobile Cutlass for an alleged 
speeding violation on the northbound Harbor Freeway, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the officers attempted to stop the Oldsmobile, the driver accelerated to 
about 100 m.p.h. and turned out his lights," Moore said, adding that an LAPD 
helicopter joined the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
After the Oldsmobile left the freeway at Manchester Avenue, Booth said, it 
crashed into a parked car in the 400 block of East 81st Street and the suspects 
fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who claimed they watched the car careen down 81st Street said two of 
the suspects leaped out just before the Oldsmobile hit the parked car. The 
remaining two fled after the crash. The neighbors also insisted they did not 
see the men carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Booth said, Ward and several other officers from the 77th 
Street Division arrived and joined in the search for the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested Jacko, Johnson and the 16-year-old shortly after the search 
began. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis sprinted down an alley on Towne Avenue near 81st Street and scrambled 
up a wooden fence, said Moore. 
</P>
<P>
As Ward and his partner, Sgt. Michael O'Donnell, approached Davis from one 
side, two other officers saw the suspect and ordered him to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman said that when Davis motioned as if he had a gun, Raichel and 
Kaleinick fired four shots each from their 9-millimeter pistols. About the same 
time, Ward was shot as he was approaching Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking the suspect had shot his partner, O'Donnell fired at Davis but missed, 
Moore said. Davis then jumped the fence and darted behind an old trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect was then confronted by another officer, Frank Mendoza, 
who fired three shots, hitting him twice. 
</P>
<P>
"When Davis made a sudden turn in Officer Mendoza's direction, the officer, 
believing that the suspect was going to shoot him, fired three rounds at 
Davis," said Moore. 
</P>
<P>
The official police account of the incident, however, conflicted at times with 
a version given to 77th Street Division officers at roll call Thursday morning, 
according to an officer who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, who asked not to be identified, told The Times that Ward's 
colleagues were informed by supervisors that much of the confusion at the 
shooting scene arose because the officers from the 77th Street and Southeast 
stations were on different radio frequencies and could not communicate with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
At the roll call, he said, supervisors said that Ward's partner had to "shoot 
his way out of the yard" in order to get himself and the wounded officer out of 
the line of fire. In doing so, he added, O'Donnell fired two shots, not knowing 
at whom he was shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Booth disagreed with the statements given by the unidentified officer, calling 
them "rumors."

Cambodian refugee leaders have threatened to refuse food supplies in protesting 
a temporary cut in United Nations aid, U.N. officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction was imposed Tuesday because supplies to the camp, run by one of 
the groups opposed to the Phnom Penh government, were being diverted to 
guerrillas involved in a two-week offensive against government troops in 
neighboring Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that leaders of Site 2, the biggest civilian camp along the Thai 
border, have rejected demands by the U.N. Border Relief Operation that supplies 
not be diverted. 
</P>
<P>
Officials reduced total supplies by more than 15% after they saw four trucks 
carrying rice to military camps along the Cambodian border.

2 SISTERS RECOVERING AFTER CAR PLOWS INTO HOCKEY FANS 
</P>

Two sisters from Azusa were recovering in area hospitals Thursday after 
undergoing surgery for serious injuries suffered when an allegedly drunk driver 
plowed into a crowd of hockey fans outside the Forum in Inglewood on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Marie Giorgi, 32, was listed in fair condition at UCLA Medical Center 
after undergoing surgery for a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. Sandy 
Giorgi, 31, was reported in satisfactory condition at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood after surgery for a head injury. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that formal charges are expected to be filed today against 
Karen Celia Burks, 36, of Inglewood, who was being held Thursday in lieu of 
$12,500 bail. The charges could include felony drunk driving and attempted 
murder, Inglewood police said. 
</P>
<P>
Burks was westbound on 90th Street, near Prairie Street, when she allegedly 
drove her 1976 Buick Regal around several vehicles that had stopped for the 
crowd surging through a crosswalk, heading toward a parking lot after a game 
between the Los Angeles Kings and the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Burks, who had not attended the hockey game, allegedly slammed into the fans at 
a speed estimated by witnesses as 20 to 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Giorgi was dragged 50 to 60 feet, police said, before the vehicle came to 
a halt and people in the crowd could lift it to free her. In addition to the 
Giorgis, six other fans suffered minor injuries in the crash. They were treated 
at area hospitals and released. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very fortunate we didn't have a lot more victims," Inglewood Police 
Officer John Winters said. "She never attempted to stop, according to 
witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Police Sgt. Harold P. Moret said that Burks may have been unable to 
stop. "A preliminary check of the car by the officers investigating (showed) 
the car had no brakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moret declined comment on the results of an alcohol test administered to Burks. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Kings refused comment on the accident since it did not 
take place on Forum property. But she added that "we will definitely be sending 
flowers" to the victims.

2 FOUND SLAIN AT REMOTE SHOOTING RANGE IN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bodies of two men who were shot to death after going to a remote shooting 
range in the Angeles National Forest were discovered by an off-duty police 
officer who went to the spot for target practice, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said the shootings were not accidental and a murder 
investigation is proceeding. No arrests have been made and there are no 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Ernesto Banegas Jr., 30, of Arcadia, and Clayton 
Blasingame, 20, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Their bodies were found about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Middle Shooting Range 
in Upper Big Tujunga Canyon, northeast of Pasadena, Sgt. Ernie Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer, whose name was not released, made the discovery 
at the untended shooting range in a remote area west of the Angeles Forest 
Highway, Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was off-duty and had gone to the range to shoot," Roop said. "Apparently, 
the victims were at the range for the same purpose and it is unknown what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims had been shot once in the chest and the other had multiple 
bullet wounds, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how long they had been dead, said coroner's spokesman Scott 
Carrier.

JUDGE BARS ANTI-ABORTION CENTERS FROM PROVIDING PREGNANCY TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operators of 25 Southern California anti-abortion counseling centers were 
ordered Thursday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to stop providing 
pregnancy testing as part of their effort to persuade women not to get 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The Right to Life League of Southern California, which runs the centers, also 
was forbidden from advertising in the "clinic" section of telephone books 
because it is not a licensed medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel granted the permanent injunction in response 
to a civil suit, which accused the centers of practicing medicine without a 
license and disguising anti-abortion lectures as "pregnancy counseling." 
</P>
<P>
She then stayed a portion of the ruling pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, the first of its kind in California on this issue, was hailed as a 
victory for pro-choice advocates, who have been battling such clinics 
nationwide. The pro-choice forces have contended that such centers have billed 
themselves as places to discuss pregnancy options, when they actually are 
"fronts for anti-abortion propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
Feminist attorney Gloria Allred, who handled the case, said of the ruling: 
"Women will be out of the clutches of the anti-abortion propagandists.' 
</P>
<P>
The Right to Life League is expected to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Carpenter-McMillan, president of the nonprofit league, said described the 
legal challenge as "harassment by pro-abortion forces. These so-called women of 
choice are trying to limit the choice of all women. The judge bought into their 
. . . rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
The league has been under a preliminary court order for four years to not tell 
clients directly the results of laboratory tests at their clinics. The center 
workers were permitted to provide the women with sealed envelopes containing 
the laboratory results and then counsel them on pregnancy options. 
</P>
<P>
However, the order issued Thursday went further. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel ruled that telling the clients whether they are pregnant or not 
constitutes a diagnosis and is forbidden because the counselors are not 
licensed medical professionals. The centers, she said, cannot administer the 
pregnancy tests, interpret laboratory results or give the results to the 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
However, pending appeal, the judge ruled that the centers can still give 
clients sealed envelopes with the laboratory results as long as they provide a 
written warning to the client to see a doctor regarding the test results. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel added that the centers, under the order, could do pregnancy testing only 
if they became licensed medical facilities and hired medical professionals. The 
order does not bar the Right to Life centers from referring clients to doctors 
or laboratories for the pregnancy tests. It also allows them to give them 
pregnancy test kits to take home and administer themselves. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Shanti Friend, 29, testified that she looked in the Yellow 
Pages under clinics and saw an advertisement for "free pregnancy testing." She 
said she thought it was a medical clinic and when she arrived at the Torrance 
facility explained that she wanted the pregnancy test. 
</P>
<P>
However, Friend testified, she was taken into a room by a counselor who 
subjected her to a "horrifying" anti-abortion lecture in which photographs of 
mutilated fetuses were shown. The counselor told her "horror stories about 
botched abortions, and that the world needed more babies," she testified. She 
left the center in tears, and did not return to get the results of her 
pregnancy test, Friend testified. 
</P>
<P>
Right to Life attorney Charles Cummings had argued that there was never an 
attempt to mislead clients at the centers. And he noted that each client was 
given a written disclaimer with a recommendation to see a doctor to verify the 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
However, an official testifying in behalf of the centers said that they used 
the free pregnancy tests as a "hook" and "marketing device" to get clients to 
the center to hear the anti-abortion lectures.

MILAN COUTURE DARES TO VENTURE BEYOND THE FRINGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELA PETROFF, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Italian designers wrap up their shows of warm-weather wears, everyone from 
Ferre to Krizia and Fendi has gone an individual way, with less of a common 
thread to the collections than in past seasons. 
</P>
<P>
However, all the leading designers here agree about one item -- fringe. Usually 
long and silky, it appears on shawls and scarves. Often it makes up the hemline 
of a dress. 
</P>
<P>
For color, the news is that bright shades are definitely back. Possibly, 
designers are drawing inspiration from the the many fruit flavors of Italian 
ice cream: mango, banana, papaya, coconut, kiwi, raspberry, apricot, peach, 
watermelon, orange, lemon, lime and many more. 
</P>
<P>
The trend in hemlines is to hike them up, with mid-thigh the preferred length, 
especially on petticoated party dresses. For those who prefer to keep their 
knees to themselves, the Milan runway offers lots of pants, either very loose 
or skin tight. 
</P>
<P>
But for novelty items, the look is bare above the waist. Models with bare 
backs, bare midriffs, even bare breasts paraded down the runway this week, in 
bra tops, bustiers, low-back dresses and see-through blouses. 
</P>
<P>
Footwear for next spring and summer will be mostly flat by day, and sometimes 
even by night. 
</P>
<P>
The newest shoe is the Krizia ankle strap platform shoe, taken right out of the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and beads are back in a big way, appearing in large bracelets, necklaces 
and earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best looks of the week were seen in Gianfranco Ferre's collection. 
International fame has not changed the Italian master, who showed his own line 
in Milan this week and will present his first ready-to-wear collection for 
Christian Dior next week in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre still cuts a modest, bashful figure with his rotund body and bearded, 
chubby face as he comes out on the runway for the standing ovation that greets 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
He seems embarrassed by the lipstick marks left by his models who vie to kiss 
him on the runway, and inevitably takes out a handkerchief to wipe away his 
tears of emotion at another successful show. Yet this shy man showed yet 
another sexy, self-confident and unmistakeably identifiable collection for 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ferre puts the accent on the upper body, with broad shoulders and ornate 
neckline tapering into a small waist and narrow hips. He favors see-through 
fabrics, tight contours and bold hemlines. 
</P>
<P>
Bare midriff, chiffon, see-through blouses are worn under slick man-tailored 
suits with large rhinestone and gold buttons. A huge silk corsages of flowers 
and feathers and bejeweled cufflinks turn a man-tailored shirts into something 
very feminine. 
</P>
<P>
Pants are cut straight for day and night, and they are a dandy's delight, 
coupled with an oversized white blouse with a spill of panels down the front 
resembling a huge bouquet of napkins. 
</P>
<P>
As the day goes on, Ferre's style becomes more elaborate, culminating in a 
series of chiffon floral and paisley printed gowns richly decorated with gold 
and crystal sequins. 
</P>
<P>
At Krizia, designer Mariuccia Mandelli showed a young and carefree collection 
with an accent on the 1940s. To the tune of "In the Mood," Krizia showed that 
by day she was in the mood for bright colors, short easy shapes and lots of 
prim navy blue and white. 
</P>
<P>
Neat daytime navy-blue suits and dresses with crisp white lapels, alternated 
with T-shirts adorned with the new Krizia animal, the giraffe. These were worn 
over cheerleader shorts in tropical shades. 
</P>
<P>
At night, Krizia indulged in her favorite fabric -- accordian-pleated silk -- 
for beautiful shawled blouses and wafty pastel-colored short party dresses. 
</P>
<P>
For more than an hour, Krizia's models kept coming down the runway in what 
proved to be an extremely long show. While reporters simply put down their 
notebooks, rowdier photographers shouted "Basta!" -- "Enough!" 
</P>
<P>
At Fendi, the look is '50s, with short, petticoated party dresses and streaming 
chiffon scarves at the neckline.

FIRST PERSON: GRANDMA LOSES SELF IN SMOTHERHOOD ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Over lunch she tells me that she has just finished painting the baby's room and 
the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're trying to decide on the right color for the carpet. We need 
something stain-resistant. You know babies." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing is that the baby is her daughter's, not hers. 
</P>
<P>
I look at my friend and wonder how she has the energy, with her arthritis and 
her part-time job, to go to her pregnant daughter's house and do all this work. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't understand," she says, "I'm remodeling the sewing room in our house 
for the baby. I want them to feel that they can bring him over any time. It's 
the least we can do. After all, this is our first grandchild. We've already got 
the crib and the high chair painted blue . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Do they know the baby is going to be a boy?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"No, but we all hope so." 
</P>
<P>
I stopped eating my cheesecake. "Are you contemplating sitting for the baby 
when Cindy goes back to work?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, no," she promises me, "we just want to help out. I've already bought a 
complete layette, and we even bought a savings bond for him." 
</P>
<P>
It was then I realized that my friend and I would never again talk about books, 
current events, old times in school, or any of the things we usually talked 
about at lunches. From now on, we would just be talking about Cindy's baby. 
</P>
<P>
She goes on to discuss whether Cindy should nurse the baby. 
</P>
<P>
I remind her that that should be Cindy's decision. But that doesn't seem to 
bother her, because she goes right on talking about why she doesn't approve of 
the Lamaze childbirth method. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the baby was born two months later, and all is well. I don't see my 
friend anymore. We don't even talk on the phone. And the baby is a girl! 
</P>
<P>
Look, I understand some of this. I was once a first-time grandmother. It is a 
wonderful experience. 
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, I've lost a friend to grandmotherhood -- call it grandmother 
smotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
I am wondering if, in her exuberance, my friend has diffused her deep love with 
a sense of ownership, if she has crossed the boundary of rational 
grandmothering. 
</P>
<P>
At this writing, Cindy has not gone back to work, but my friend divides her 
days between Cindy's house and her own house, where she keeps the baby for long 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
I understand Cindy's husband is getting a little tired of his mother-in-law 
coming over in the evening to ask if she can bathe the baby and put her to bed, 
and he is concerned that the grandmother is spoiling the baby. And now I hear 
that my friend's back and knees are worse because of the stairs she's climbing 
at her daughter's house. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of things are happening here. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy, an only child, will never really know what it's like to have a baby of 
her own. She may never know what it's like to have to search for a sitter, or 
be up all night with a sick baby and then try to take a nap the next day, 
utterly exhausted. Why? Because mom came over and shouldered the 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Usually motherhood breeds inner strength and character. Ask any mother. 
</P>
<P>
But Cindy will be a little light in that department because her mother takes 
over more and more of the tedious (read that character-building) chores. 
</P>
<P>
Will Cindy eventually resent the parental interference? Moreover, will Cindy 
ever grow up? And will her mother ever learn to "let go"? 
</P>
<P>
Other friends say that when you ask my friend and her husband over for dinner, 
she has to check with Cindy first -- "they may need me," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, I'm not saying Cindy isn't the luckiest new mother in the world to have 
such support. But my friend is 69, not old but no spring chicken, either. Her 
involvement with the baby is slightly out of balance. Sure, it would be 
different if Cindy was going back to work and her mother kept the baby -- 
today, there are a lot of full-time, on-duty grannies, God bless them all 
(recent statistics show that more than half of the women having babies go back 
to work). 
</P>
<P>
I wonder: Is Cindy's baby the hoped-for second child my friend never had? I 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's six months from the birth of Cindy's baby and my friend has just 
called on the telephone. She is devastated. Cindy's husband is being 
transferred to another city across the country. I suggest my friend go back to 
her part-time job right away. 
</P>
<P>
So now we will all step in to help fill the gap -- the gap left by a small baby 
in a grandmother's life. My heart aches for my friend. Maybe we should have 
prepared her better. 
</P>
<P>
I find myself telling her that Cindy will be fine in another city -- yes, even 
without her mother. I have to tell her that, it's the only fair thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
And I hope I am right. Oh yes, I forgot to say that my friend, Cindy's mother, 
has a very understanding husband.

'BAKER BOYS' COOKS A SALTY, SEXY MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (citywide) everywhere. They play under 
expense-account dinners at restaurants with little paper umbrellas in the 
banana daiquiris. Their unyielding patter has intruded on more than one 
businessman's proposition to the new girl in Accounts Receivable. They played 
"Feelings" and "People" and "The Girl From Ipanema" 358 times last year, and 
with any luck, they'll play them again next year. 
</P>
<P>
They've shown us no mercy, why should we cut them any slack? Because "The 
Fabulous Baker Boys," a clear-eyed look at an unpromising end of show biz, is 
as salty and sexy and unhousebroken a movie as you could hope to find. Because 
writer-director Steve Kloves has a keen eye, a mean wit and a romantic's heart. 
And because the fabulous Bridges boys are just that, and Michelle Pfeiffer is 
delectable, even for her. It does not seem fair that she can sing, too. Maybe 
she can't cook. Things have to even out somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As Frank Baker (Beau Bridges) will confide to us, want him to or not, he and 
Jack (Jeff Bridges) have been across the 88 keys from each other, gosh, how 
many years now? Thirty-one? Fifteen of them on-stage as professionals. 
</P>
<P>
That's a long time on two piano stools. And the funny-dreadful opening scenes 
make it clear what a long, slow trip down it's been. Fluorescent luau shirts at 
Tiki-Bob's. Tuxedos at the Starfire Lounge. Apathetic, half-sloshed audiences 
everywhere, 30 years older than they are. Frank would keep grinding on, night 
after night, but when an old client pays them not to play one night, it's a 
sign that the act needs resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
The 37 girls who audition to be their singer are pretty grand. Their gestures 
all seem to have been coached by the same folks who do the Junior Miss America 
pageant, and not one of them can carry a tune. (OK, so the 
audition-routine-sequence owes everything to Milos Forman's "Taking Off." 
Almost every audition scene since then has; it's still fiendishly funny.) At 
least these damsels succeed in getting Jack's total, mesmerized attention, 
although it's probably just an untapped strain of masochism. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Susie Diamond (Pfeiffer), whose most recent professional experience has 
been on call for the Triple-A escort service, and who has to park her gum 
before she sings. Her number? "More Than You Know," and right away we know; my 
do we know. 
</P>
<P>
With just the right rough edges on this Diamond (and with some really witty 
music and visual editing effects), we watch these three pound together an act 
while keeping their lives almost separated. Frank has an (unseen) wife, family 
and house in the suburbs. Tough cookie Susie has A Past. And Jack has an aging 
Labrador and Nina, the adoring pre-teen-ager from the upstairs apartment who 
may not even need a T-shirt that reads "Dramatic Device." 
</P>
<P>
After a wonderfully rocky start, Susie becomes more and more experienced, until 
the boys find themselves in the astonishing position of being sought after 
instead of being barely tolerated. This upward curve to the story is lovely; 
especially a delicately staged and brilliantly photographed scene on a resort 
hotel balcony, as the longings of all three are revealed in a scene that's 
almost a subtle aria. (The cinematographer is Michael Ballhaus, which should 
explain everything.) 
</P>
<P>
The movie's musical high point is a New Year's Eve scorcher when an emergency 
calls Frank away and, left to program their own gala, Jack and Susie greet the 
incoming year with a version of "Makin' Whoopee" that takes no prisoners. The 
love scene that follows -- staged tenderly, so that we just see Jack's mouth on 
the exquisite trench of Susie's naked back -- is one that's been building since 
these two bedroom veterans set eyes on one another. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the story seems to take an unexpected bounce. While we're braced for the 
plot line about the show-business team that breaks up because one member is 
offered bigger things, writer Kloves is more interested in the relationship of 
the boys themselves, as musicians and as brothers. Susie becomes the force 
needed to have Jack face how much he really hates his life. And the movie 
requires first a lover's quarrel, then a brother's, before things are right 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Even with patches of tired dialogue about her checkered past, Pfeiffer's Susie 
fills the screen so vividly that a lot of the life leaves it when she does, 
even briefly. Normally, Jeff Bridges' presence would make up for any imbalance, 
but he's playing a man whose psyche is so retracted it's barely there. Between 
that and what passes for declarations of attraction on the modern American 
scene these days, we are not talking major affect here. For an ending to a 
picture this delicious, it's like a crepe compared to triple-decker strawberry 
shortcake. You may just have to learn to love crepes. 
</P>
<P>
The performances, at least, couldn't be improved upon. Les Boys have honed 
their timing so their exchanges, like the one about Frank's touch-up paint for 
his bald spot, or the fruit war in their hotel suite, are lethally funny 
without losing their sense of underlying love. Now singing too, Pfeiffer seems 
to be in the same niche that Ava Gardner was in after "The Flying Dutchman," as 
the screen's reigning goddess. No objections here.

BYRNE HEADS IN NEW DIRECTION WITH LATIN BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It didn't take long for one Phi Beta Kappa to shout "Babalu!" on Wednesday at 
the Pantages Theatre, where the white-suited David Byrne was performing his 
latest music with a big Latin American band. 
</P>
<P>
That's probably an accurate reflection of the pop audience's level of exposure 
to South American and Caribbean sounds, so once again Byrne gets credit for 
broadening his fans' experience. 
</P>
<P>
But on the surface there's something a bit off-putting about the way this 
privileged American flits from one Third World outpost to another, seeking the 
primitive purity and pagan freedom -- the soulfulness -- his white heritage and 
art training have denied him. The underlying implication -- that this rich, 
self-sufficient Latin music somehow needs a Western pop star's validation -- is 
patronizing at best. 
</P>
<P>
But it was hard to make those charges stick when faced with Byrne's generosity 
of spirit and eagerness to share his passion at the Pantages. "What can I say? 
I'm glad you like it," he remarked late in the show, with the surprised 
pleasure of a kid whose experiment just won first prize at a science fair. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne's Latin exploration -- foreshadowed earlier this year by a collection of 
Brazilian music that he compiled, and fulfilled in his current solo album "Rei 
Momo" -- doesn't yield the startling, revelatory synthesis of Talking Heads' 
earlier plunges into funk and African music. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne signaled as much by making this show (which continues at the Pantages 
through Sunday, then moves to San Diego's Starlight Bowl on Tuesday and the 
Santa Barbara County Bowl on Wednesday) a lighter, less challenging affair than 
a Talking Heads event, as if it should be ranked on a different scale. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne didn't establish a persona, and in fact he stayed as much in the 
background as any lead singer and star of the show reasonably could. His most 
forceful moves came when he stepped out periodically to show off some 
enthusiastic dance steps, like a shy tourist suddenly intoxicated by the beat. 
</P>
<P>
The show began with six drummers and percussionists interlocking their beats 
behind singer Margareth Menezes, and it was clear from the players' 
concentration, and the way they swung a free arm or marched in place, that this 
would be an evening of serious rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
On "Rei Momo," the delicate surges and subtle dynamics work in service of the 
songs, which are mainly in the airy, amiable style of latter-day Talking Heads. 
(The only two Heads songs of the set were revised versions of "Mr. Jones" and 
"Papa Legba.") The faintly disquieting tone of some of the lyrics meshes well 
with the Latin sound: Both cloak their melancholy with bright surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, everything had a bolder attack and broader strokes, and the focus was 
on the band and the sound. With the musicians numbering 16 at full strength, 
that sound was often prodigious: Percussion blasted like buckshot into the 
billowing curtains of brass, and the whole finely-tuned machine lifted off on 
the wings of Byrne's elongated melodies. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the audience didn't lift off, at least until well into the show. 
This kind of music should be played in a ballroom with a dance floor, not in a 
formal, classy theater. The atmosphere remained curiously flat until Byrne 
suggested that the audience dance, and then it got hectic when ushers suggested 
the dancers get out of the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad. In the right setting, this show could be as hot as, well, one of Ricky 
Ricardo's good nights at the Tropicana. 
</P>

MGM/UA PLANS MAJOR MARCH RELEASE OF DAVIS MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the best films of Bette Davis, who died last Friday, already are on 
home video, but there are still a few quality ones that haven't been released. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA, which has a large Davis library, had planned a major release for April, 
but now is moving the date up to March, according to programming director 
George Feltenstein. 
</P>
<P>
The titles, which will retail at $19.98, include "Dangerous" -- the 1935 drama 
featuring her Oscar-winning performance -- "The Man Who Came to Dinner' (1941), 
"The Great Lie" (1941), "In This Our Life" (1942), "A Stolen Life" (1946) and 
"Deception" (1946). 
</P>
<P>
Also part of that release will be two movies previously out on CBS-Fox -- "The 
Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" (1939) and "The Petrified Forest" (1936). 
The rights to these movies have reverted to MGM/UA. Feltenstein said "Elizabeth 
and Essex" will be duplicated from an improved print. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if you're looking to savor Davis' finest work now, focus on movies 
made between the mid-'30s and early '50s. By the late '50s, she was doing 
character roles. Only a handful of her films from then on are worth your time. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the most prominent Davis films that are available on home 
video -- all for $24.95 or less: 
</P>
<P>
"Of Human Bondage" (Congress, 1934). The tragic tale of a doctor's (Leslie 
Howard) obsession with a trashy waitress (Davis). Though impressive back then, 
her performance now seems like overacting. Still, it's the role that made her a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
"Jezebel" (MGM/UA, 1938). Davis won an Oscar for her role as a sassy, spiteful, 
Scarlett O'Hara-like character in this absorbing pre-Civil War drama. She's 
delightfully tempestuous until she turns noble at the end. Henry Fonda co-stars 
as her fiance. The Oscar notwithstanding, this is good but not great Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Dark Victory" (MGM/UA, 1939). In possibly her most famous tear-jerker, Davis 
plays a selfish, carefree socialite who finds out she's dying of a brain tumor. 
While doing some re-evaluating, she's consoled by husband-surgeon (George 
Brent). Sure, it's excessively manipulative and riddled with cliches, but just 
try to sit through it with dry eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Little Foxes" (Nelson/Orion, 1941). To veteran Davis fans, her scheming, 
callous Regina -- one of the screen's great evil leading characters -- is 
Davis' crowning glory. Based on Lillian Hellman's play, this meaty melodrama 
chronicles how greed destroys a Southern family. For those unfamiliar with 
Davis in her prime, this is the movie to see. 
</P>
<P>
"The Letter" (MGM/UA, 1940). Set is Malaya, it features Davis in one of her 
finest villain roles, this time playing a murderer who's hiding behind a 
self-defense plea. Directed by William Wyler and co-starring Herbert Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Voyager" (MGM/UA, 1942). Davis's best soap opera, though not her best 
performance in a soap opera. She plays a sheltered spinster who flowers into a 
sophisticate under the guidance of a psychiatrist (Paul Henried). Henried's 
dual cigarette-lighting scene was long considered one of the screen's great 
romantic moments. But, in this anti-smoking era, it's just a curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Skeffington" (MGM/UA, 1944). Possibly Davis' most overlooked, underrated 
drama, this sprawling soap, covering several decades, is about a selfish woman 
(Davis) who marries a stockbroker (Claude Rains) out of greed. Later on, the 
relationship ripens into love. Davis' intense, all-out performance belongs in 
her Top Five. 
</P>
<P>
"All About Eve" (CBS-Fox, 1950). To many critics, this is Davis' best 
performance -- as tough, cynical Broadway actress Margo Channing, who's the 
target of the trickery of deceptive Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Possibly 
Davis' most famous movie, it's a good introduction to those who know little 
about her. 
</P>
<P>
"A Pocketful of Miracles" (1961, MGM/UA, $19.98). The best of Davis' old-lady 
character roles. In this adaptation of a Damon Runyon story, she plays Apple 
Annie, a derelict who, to cover up a well-meaning lie, has to be transformed 
into a society matron. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" (Warner, 1962). Fun, campy, horror tale, with 
Davis, as a sadistic ex-child star, grandly caricaturing some of her old roles. 
This one, co-starring Joan Crawford, resurrected Davis' career and earned her a 
best-actress nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"The Whales of August" (Nelson/Orion, 1987). Talky character study consisting 
of two elderly sisters fussing at each other in a Maine summer cottage. More of 
interest as a bit of film history, watching Davis work with another cinema 
grand dame, silent-star Lillian Gish. 
</P>
<P>
Few of Davis' movies from the early 1930s are available on home video, 
including her first, "Bad Sister," a bad 1930 film notable because it was one 
of Humphrey Bogart's earliest movies. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Davis films not yet on video, the ones to watch for are 'Kid Galahad" 
(1937), "Old Acquaintance" (1943), "The Star" (1952), "A Catered Affair" (1956) 
and "Storm Center" (1956). 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the Forest," a 1949 murder mystery, isn't on home video either. 
Co-starring Joseph Cotten, the film isn't particularly suspenseful, but it's 
noteworthy because it features Davis delivering her signature line, "What a 
dump." 
</P>
<P>
Davis' last film, "The Wicked Stepmother" -- which received only limited 
theatrical release and was controversial because of the star's well-publicized 
battles with director Larry Cohen -- is due out on MGM/UA on Nov. 14 at $79.95.

ACLU STARTS A 'BUYCOTT' OF TV PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 35,000-member Southern California affiliate of the American Civil Liberties 
Union has launched a campaign to combat fundamentalist groups that it says have 
tried to censor television programs in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is aimed at supporting programs -- including "Midnight Caller," 
"Knots Landing" and "Tour of Duty" -- that have been targeted by the Rev. 
Donald Wildmon's Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (CLeaR-TV) as 
containing "high incidents of sex, violence, profanity and anti-Christian 
stereotyping." In July, CLeaR-TV launched a one-year boycott of the Mennen Co. 
and Clorox Corp. for sponsoring those and other programs it deemed to be 
"un-Christian." 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU campaign was launched Wednesday night at a symposium on "Cultural 
Censorship in the '90s" at the Museum of Contemporary Art. The campaign seeks 
to back the Mennen Co. and Clorox Corp. through a supportive letter-writing 
campaign and a "buycott," in which members will be urged to go out of their way 
to buy the companies' products. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ACLU chapter will boycott the next consumer products company 
that bows to pressure from fundamentalist groups and pulls its advertising from 
a TV program, said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"To those sponsors who, because of fear, ignorance or (to avoid) inconvenience, 
decide that the mere threat of opposition from the small but vocal censorship 
groups is reason enough to abandon their commitments -- to those sponsors, 
beware," Ripston told the more than 100 people at the symposium. "We are here 
and we are waiting. And that's our bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here tonight to say that we're taking back our power -- our power to 
decide what we will read, what we will view on television, what we will listen 
to on the radio, and what we will purchase in the stores. We will steadfastly 
defend the television industry's right to produce and air its creative products 
without fear of censorship or the loss of corporate sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers, she said, "are running scared. They get a few letters and they 
think it's a movement. The important thing is to let the people in the 
television industry feel free to create the kind of show they want to create. 
If sponsors know there's going to be support for them, then I think they'll go 
ahead and support these programs."

NOW HARD ROCKERS, RAPPERS SPREAD AIDS WARNING TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The older, mainstream contingent of the pop world -- including Dionne Warwick, 
Elton John and Stevie Wonder -- has been active in raising public awareness of 
AIDS, but the hard-core rock community has been slow to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
That's why a Music Against Aids memorabilia auction on Sunday in Beverly Hills 
represents a breakthrough of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
The event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, will give pop fans a chance to bid on items 
donated by such mainstream stars as Michael Jackson (a Stetson fedora), Janet 
Jackson (jeans she wore in her "Rhythm Nation" video), Mick Jagger (a cape he 
wore on stage during the Rolling Stones' 1979 tour) and Prince (a 
limited-edition "Batman" CD). 
</P>
<P>
But Howard Portugais, a member of the board of governors of the academy's Los 
Angeles chapter and one of the organizers of the event, whose proceeds will go 
to the American Foundation for AIDS Research, feels it is especially 
significant that some anti-Establishment hard rockers and rappers are lending 
support. They include members of the groups Faster Pussycat and the Beastie 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in a position to change something or say something, it's kind of a 
cop-out if you don't," said Faster Pussycat's guitarist Brent Muscat, who 
believes some hard-rockers might fear that speaking about AIDS would chink 
their devil-may-care armor. 
</P>
<P>
Muscat got involved in Sunday's event -- he is donating a gold jacket that he 
wore on stage during the band's last tour and also serving as an event 
spokesman -- after seeing an MTV news feature in which Bangles member Susanna 
Hoffs talked about the auction and gave a phone number for volunteers and 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Wow! I wish I was involved,' " said Muscat, 22. "I've always been 
interested (in AIDS) and read up on it. The guys in my band talk about it a 
lot, and we're really concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people still view it as a gay and drug-user disease. But even 
if it was . . . it's everybody's problem. People are people. It's something 
that's gonna affect everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-rock involvement with the issue has been checkered at best. Last spring 
Guns N' Roses was scheduled to headline a New York benefit for the Gay Men's 
Health Crisis organization. 
</P>
<P>
But gay activists, incensed at what they believed were anti-gay references in a 
Guns N' Roses song, insisted that the band be removed from the bill. 
(Representatives of Guns N' Roses did not respond to requests for interviews 
for this article.) Last year, members of Poison, discussing their computer log 
of groupies around the country, joked that safe sex meant not falling out of 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see groups that are really image-conscious saying they'd rather not 
talk about it," said Brian Wheat, bassist of the Sacramento-based band Tesla. 
"But, if the truth were to be known, I'm sure all those guys wear condoms. No 
one wants to die that death, whether you're a bad boy of rock 'n' roll or not." 
</P>
<P>
But Wheat -- who was unaware of the auction when contacted by The Times -- 
admitted that the storied rock 'n' roll life style calls for extra 
consideration in the face of AIDS. Though three of the five members of Tesla 
are married and Wheat has a steady girlfriend, he acknowledged: "Hard-rock 
bands are pretty promiscuous. . . . You can't go, 'It will never happen to me.' 
It has nothing to do with image." 
</P>
<P>
Portugais, a manager who has worked with Dusty Springfield, Groucho Marx and 
other show-business figures, and other organizers of Sunday's event said it is 
particularly important for members of the hard-rock community to speak out 
because of statistics that suggest that an it-can't-happen-to-me attitude is 
still prevalent among teens, the primary audience for hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
So why aren't many hard-rock stars speaking out against AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are a little ignorant," said Muscat. "For some of the hard-rock 
people maybe it hasn't hit home, but it's going to and people are going to wake 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Burt Bacharach, co-writer of the song "That's What Friends Are For," which has 
raised more than $1 million for AIDS research and education since it was 
released in 1985, agrees that teen hard-rock fans are the greatest challenge 
and the key target in the AIDS awareness campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Any major heavy-metal group saying that this is important, the attention it 
would call, the money it would raise," Bacharach said. "It would have a 
powerful impact on young people." 
</P>
<P>
But while Bacharach admits to "high frustration" at the failure to get the 
message to teens, he is optimistic that things will change as AIDS touches more 
young people's lives. He's already seen awareness grow around the country 
through the acceptance of "That's What Friends Are For." 
</P>
<P>
But the very nature of the teen mind-set and rock 'n' roll bravado provides a 
major stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up and losing my virginity or whatever," said Muscat, "it 
was a kind of time where I was going for it . . . when I was 16 and in my 
rebellious period. But, as you get smarter, you calm down." 
</P>
<P>

IRVINE: The city's progressive policies are a hit in Manhattan, where The New 
Yorker magazine lauded the city for its ban on chlorofluorocarbons, admiringly 
calling the policy "idealistic, even quixotic." . . . Columnist Dianne Klein 
(B1) takes a less idealistic view of yet another Irvine venture -- the creation 
of a downtown with a grand boulevard like the Champs Elysees.

BISHOPS RETRENCH ON CONDOM USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Countering a controversial earlier position, a committee of Roman Catholic 
bishops Thursday issued a draft of a new policy paper on the AIDS crisis that 
strongly rejects any use of condoms to prevent the spread of the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
The document, which says sexual abstinence outside marriage is the only moral 
and practical solution, also condemns programs in which sterile needles are 
dispersed to drug addicts to dissuade them from placing themselves at even 
greater risk of infection by sharing contaminated needles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, chairman of the five-member committee, 
was one of several bishops who had objected to the earlier statement that gave 
implicit permission to church hospitals and agencies to provide information on 
condoms as a potential safeguard against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony called the first statement "terribly confusing" to Catholics. 
Compromising on Catholic teaching in order to be more influential in public 
policy "has never been our role," he said. "Even to start down that road is 
fraught with difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
Diocese of Orange Bishop Norman F. McFarland said he had not read the draft 
statement, which came in Thursday's mail, but restated his support for the 
teaching of chastity as the only moral way to prevent AIDS and his opposition 
to the use of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives a false sense of security for one thing," he said, "because condoms 
are not a sure (preventive response to) AIDS. But even if they were, they 
couldn't be used for that purpose because it would be an immoral act." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first statement was approved by the U.S. bishops' 50-member 
administrative board in December, 1987, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the 
Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, joined in the criticism and 
admonished the U.S. bishops for not consulting with Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, adapting the statement for his own archdiocese, revised five sentences 
to flatly prohibit the endorsement of public health recommendations on condoms. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 300 bishops reached a compromise at a June, 1988, national meeting 
by letting stand the 1987 AIDS statement, while at the same time commissioning 
a second, possibly broader, statement. 
</P>
<P>
The new draft was commissioned "to carry the discussion further and . . . have 
behind it the weight of the entire American hierarchy," Bill Ryan, a spokesman 
for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-page statement, "Called to Compassion: A Response to the HIV/AIDS 
Crisis," will probably be approved by the full body of bishops next month. HIV 
is the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS must be opposed with education, counseling and persuasion," the new 
document said. But it charged that promoting condom use is a "quick-fix tactic" 
doomed to failure in the long run." Although some studies have shown condoms 
are not a foolproof method of preventing infection, health officials advocate 
their use as one way of stemming the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"The safe-sex approach to preventing HIV/AIDS, though frequently advocated, 
compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous sexual behavior," the 
document said. "Not only is the use of prophylactics in an attempt to halt the 
spread of HIV technically unreliable; promoting this approach means, in effect, 
promoting behavior which is morally unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"We fault these programs for another reason as well. Recognizing that casual 
sex is a risk to health, (these programs) consistently advise the use of 
condoms in order to eliminate the risk. This is poor and inadequate advice." 
</P>
<P>
The official Catholic teaching against using contraceptive devices -- even 
within marriage -- is disregarded by a large majority of the nation's 
Catholics, according to the preponderance of surveys taken during the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
And the Catholic prohibition against using condoms to stem the AIDS epidemic 
runs counter to the policies of most mainline Protestant churches and Jewish 
agencies, which generally follow recommendations by the U.S. surgeon general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Albert Ogle, an Episcopal priest who directs the All Saints AIDS 
Service Center in Pasadena, criticized the new bishops' statement for "not 
addressing what is really happening in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality," Ogle said, "is that young people in our parishes are being 
infected by the virus and will get sick and die and infect others because the 
(Roman Catholic) church has painted itself in a corner over birth control. . . 
. The church is killing young people, and that is not a pro-life stance." 
</P>
<P>
Ogle said he had worked with Mahony in founding the Interfaith AIDS Council of 
Southern California. He said he believes that the Roman Catholic Church could 
prevent the spread of AIDS in the Latino community by realistically addressing 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is moral judgment upon the church" to respond, Ogle said. 
</P>
<P>
Retired United Methodist Bishop Melvin Wheatley called it "totally irrational" 
to think that providing condoms to people who are sexually active will 
undermine the church's teachings on abstinence. Wheatley, of Laguna Hills, will 
be the featured speaker Oct. 27 at a conference of the AIDS Interfaith Council 
of Southern California.

DIANNE KLEIN: IRVINE'S CONTINENTAL FANTASY: THE RUE DE VON KARMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Personally, I think the idea of bringing Paris to Irvine is fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
In case you missed it, here's what I'm talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Irvine officials and their assorted consultants, advisers, 
associates, planners and specialists announced a plan to build their city a 
real downtown. 
</P>
<P>
(Those of you who have traveled may know what that means. In a real downtown, 
for example, they don't allow more than two frozen yogurt shops on the same 
block, there is no place for stores such as Barstools Unlimited, and at any 
given time, there is at least one work crew tearing up the pavement with 
jackhammers.) 
</P>
<P>
So you see how this is a radical concept for Irvine. Which is why they can't 
just come out and say it. 
</P>
<P>
(How do you think the Irvine City Council pushed through that ban on Styrofoam? 
Who would have guessed that was what chlorofluorocarbon meant?) 
</P>
<P>
So here's what Irvine did with its radical downtown idea. It issued the Irvine 
Business Complex Composite Sketch Plan. 
</P>
<P>
I tell you, I didn't have to read beyond the opening paragraph to know thata it 
was a master stroke. The guys who wrote this should be working for the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, they are working for the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The IBC will be characterized by its mix of uses, including housing, 
employment, shopping and cultural and recreation activities. In addition to the 
introduction of a variety of uses, the IBC will be woven together by a network 
of urban design framework elements and transportation networks, creating an 
exciting and truly urban environment." 
</P>
<P>
You get that? Of course not. I tell you, those guys are geniuses. 
</P>
<P>
So, let me translate. In Irvine, that means Paris. 
</P>
<P>
How do I know that? I actually ventured beyond the opening paragraph and there 
I spotted it: Dissension in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. I discovered evidence of a tear, albeit a small one, in the 
United Front of Irvine Bureaucrats Working for the Obfuscation of the Populace 
at Large. 
</P>
<P>
You see, further down in the IBC Composite Sketch Plan, right under the 
subheading "The Great Street," is this straight talk: 
</P>
<P>
"Paris has the Champs Elysees, San Francisco has Market Street and Boston has 
Commonwealth Avenue. Von Karman is planned to be Irvine's Great Street. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
You guessed it. Some plain-talking dissident probably let loose a computer 
virus that inserted those words just as they were about to be printed out. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the muddling follow-through -- "Because of its mix of uses, 
distinctive urban design characteristics and public transit nodes, Von Karman 
will be a place of citywide and regional importance" -- could cloud the fact 
that Irvine has Parisian fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Well, naturally, newspaper reporters being no dummies, the day after the IBC 
Complex Composite Sketch Plan hit the briefing table, newspapers all over 
Orange County were trumpeting the news that Irvine was working on a prototype 
of the Champs Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that I doubted Irvine's vision (think back to the Styrofoam ban), 
it's just that I was a little intrigued by the process. 
</P>
<P>
So I made a few calls, starting with the public relations person the city hired 
to sell its plan on an unsavvy Populace at Large (PAL). 
</P>
<P>
I asked if she could put me in touch with the person, or persons, responsible 
for writing the IBC Composite Sketch Plan. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean the actual verbiage?" she asked me. 
</P>
<P>
So I was on the right track. Verbiage is code for words. 
</P>
<P>
Then before too long, Irvine's principal city planner, Steve Letterly, who has 
been in charge of the downtown project for the past three months, gave me a 
call. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him about the Champs Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have never put that in!" he said, rather excitedly I thought, 
especially for a city planner. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them not to put that in!" he went on. "That's all I've been hearing 
about, that we are trying to rival Paris. Obviously, Irvine can't compare with 
Paris, or Boston." 
</P>
<P>
"So who put in the part about the Champs Elysees?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, the consultants," he said, rather dismissively. "They should have never 
put that in!" 
</P>
<P>
OK, I sensed what was coming, but I asked Letterly how he would have explained 
the concept of Irvine's Great Street, and the truth is, I sort of zoned out on 
most of his answer. 
</P>
<P>
(We had already gone over the multi-modal transit node, the integrated fixed 
guideway and the High Occupancy Vehicle). But what did stick with me was the 
part about how this Great Street should "function with the community." 
</P>
<P>
This Latterly repeated several times. The Champs Elysees was out. Functioning 
was in. 
</P>
<P>
So I guess this means that in future updates of the IBC Composite Sketch Plan, 
tighter controls will be placed on computer access. No more comparing Irvine 
with the world's great cities. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad. I was looking forward to strolling under Irvine's Arch de Triomphe and 
through its Place de la Concorde. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they did end up calling them "urban design framework elements." 
</P>

In the world of archconservative Phyllis Schlafly, men are men and women are 
housewives -- even if they work. In Sarah Weddington's world, men are men and 
women are whatever they want to be. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Schlafly, 65, the matron saint of family-centered womanhood, 
and Weddington, 44, a Texas lawyer who won the landmark Roe vs. Wade case in 
1973 that legalized abortion, debated inside the Bren Events Center at UC 
Irvine before an audience of about 800. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two hours, they addressed a number of contemporary issues: the 
role of women, comparable worth in women's wage scales, and abortion, including 
the recent Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, in which the Supreme Court 
opened the door for further state restrictions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
While Weddington supported a woman's right to choose whether to have children, 
Schlafly said it was the government's duty to protect the rights of the unborn 
by outlawing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to make the decision to have children?" Weddington asked. "Can 
they force it on you and make you carry a pregnancy to term, and then turn 
around and tell you it's all your responsibility? . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Every child should be a wanted child, every mother a willing mother," she 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
Schlafly retorted, amid occasional heckling from members of the crowd: "Are we 
really going to let mothers kill babies for any reason they want? No one says 
they're going to have a fetus. They say they're going to have a baby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to cutting out a baby," Schlafly said, "it is a hard decision. 
That is because it is a human life. We now know, with the advance in fetology, 
that it is a baby, and it is the purpose of government to protect that right to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Weddington countered that the concept of right to life "should mean that 
everyone should get medical care. But 37 million Americans don't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Schlafly and Weddington have been facing off on the debate circuit for several 
years. The UCI debate was one of about eight engagements the two have planned 
this year for the nation's colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
"It serves to motivate college campuses and make students take a stand on some 
of today's most controversial issues," said Jay Callahan, the agent for both 
women. "Not much gets resolved necessarily, but it forces them to think." 
</P>
<P>
UCI paid Weddington $2,500, and Schlafly, $3,500, in addition to travel 
expenses for Thursday's event. 
</P>
<P>
Before the pair set foot on campus, students circulated anti-Schlafly flyers 
that scoffed at her stands against equal pay for women and the Equal Rights 
Amendment. At 4:30 p.m., members of the Rainbow Coalition, a group of 10 to 15 
students, met in front of the main campus library to plan a protest. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of the students later showed up at the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate presents a narrow picture," said Catherine Carlassare, a student 
and member of the organization. "If we fight together to improve health care, 
we won't have to decide between babies and women." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Bren Events Center, pro-choice and anti-abortion groups set up 
tables to distribute literature. More than 100 people, mostly women, milled 
around in the lobby perusing their pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
Although security was heavy, several advertised protests failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Weddington graduated from the University of Texas Law School at age 21. She 
successfully represented Norma Nelson McCorvey, then known as "Jane Roe," in 
the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion on demand. 
</P>
<P>
The decision wiped out 100 years of abortion laws, led to more than 24 million 
abortions and helped put Weddington in the Carter White House as an adviser for 
women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
Weddington, 44, now practices law in Austin, Tex., and lectures on history and 
government at the University of Texas and Texas Women's University. 
</P>
<P>
Schlafly, a defender of traditional homemaking and family-centered womanhood, 
is widely known for her conservative views on abortion and the role of women in 
American society. She is president and founder of Eagle Forum, a pro-family 
organization active in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Schlafly, the mother of six, is credited with masterminding the defeat of the 
Equal Rights Amendment, which she said would have created a "gender-free" 
society and forced more women to work. 
</P>
<P>
For nine consecutive years, Good Housekeeping magazine has named her one of the 
10 most admired women in the world. From her Alton, Ill., home, she is now 
championing the rights of children and contends day care can harm youngsters.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY TO BUY 6.9-ACRE FARM -- $3.75 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A yearlong legal struggle over the purchase of the Ocean View Mushroom Growers 
farm ended Thursday when Huntington Beach agreed to purchase the property for 
$3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, the landowner, Huntington Beach resident Victor 
DiStefano, agreed to drop his lawsuit against the city. DiStefano had alleged 
that city workers trespassed on the now-closed mushroom farm and that police 
officers had harassed tenants living there. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been trying to purchase the 6.9 acres for more than four years and 
filed an eminent domain lawsuit last year to force the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Eminent domain allows a government body to take private land for a public 
purpose as long as it pays fair market price and receives permission from a 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The 6.9 acres are along Golden West Street north of Ellis Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city wants the former mushroom farm to extend adjacent Central Park and 
also to temporarily house mobile homes that soon will be displaced by downtown 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for the land has gone through changes in property owners and 
disagreements over price. 
</P>
<P>
With the settlement, DiStefano, 72, can collect his money and the city can take 
the land, his Newport Beach attorney, Robert Waldron, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The closing chapter has been written," Waldron said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided Wednesday in a closed session to settle the case to 
save on legal costs and to speed up the Riverfront downtown redevelopment 
project, Councilman Tom Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
If the city had taken DiStefano to trial, the city stood to lose about $6 
million in property and bed taxes from the planned hotels in the Riverfront 
project, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverfront project, situated on Pacific Coast Highway near Huntington 
Street, includes plans for four hotels, a shopping plaza, a health and tennis 
club and some type of housing, said Susan Hunt, Riverfront project manager for 
the city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, a 296-room Hilton Hotel, is expected to be 
completed by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the land to be in the Riverfront Project is occupied by the Driftwood 
Beach Club Mobile Home Park. The city, which owns the land and leases it to the 
park, has promised to relocate Driftwood residents to the mushroom farm after 
it makes improvements to the land. 
</P>

Originally, Huntington Beach offered $1.8 million for the mushroom farm, and 
earlier this year offered almost $2.4 million. But because property values have 
skyrocketed in the past few years, the city chose this week to offer more, Mays 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A city appraiser valued the land at $3.5 million, while an appraiser for the 
landowner had appraised it at more than $4 million, Mays said.

CITY, 10 OTHERS AIM FOR JOB-TRAINING ROLE 
</P>

<P>
Hoping to head off a county takeover of local job-training programs, the City 
Council has joined with 10 neighboring cities to apply for designation as an 
independent program area for the northwest portion of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week became the 11th city to pass a resolution supporting 
the application of the cities of La Habra and Garden Grove for designation as a 
separate Service Delivery Area. The resolution also requests that La Habra -- 
on behalf of the Northwest Orange County Group of cities that includes Brea, 
Buena Park, Cypress, Fullerton, La Habra, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Placentia, 
Stanton, Yorba Linda, and the unincorporated areas within their spheres of 
influence -- continue to administer employment and training programs within 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the federal Job Training Partnership Act was administered for the 
entire county through a joint-powers agreement consisting of the county, 
Anaheim, Santa Ana and Garden Grove, with La Habra acting as lead city for the 
10-city Northwest Group. Anaheim and Garden Grove have since withdrawn from the 
joint-powers agreement to form independent programs, which left Garden Grove, 
La Habra and its informal consortium, and what was known as the "balance of the 
county" to operate separate but equal programs within the county's SDA. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of resolutions from the Northwest Group and Garden Grove comes in 
response to the county's application to the state last month to administer all 
employment and job-training programs under the federal Job Training Partnership 
Act for the entire county, except for Anaheim and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously like being able to control our own destiny," said Greg Beaubien, 
Stanton's assistant city manager, who added that the city has been satisfied 
with the service it has been getting through the Northwest Group. 
</P>
<P>
Employment and job-training programs have been available to Stanton residents 
for the last 15 years under an informal cooperative agreement with the city of 
La Habra to administer the federally funded programs within the 10-city 
Northwest Group. According to the Job Training Partnership Act activity report 
for the last fiscal year, more than 450 Stanton residents have been enrolled in 
the locally administered job-training programs since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stanton, the cities that form the consortium, Beaubien said, are small 
cities that provide the same types of services to residents. The fear among the 
members of the Northwest Group is that if the administration of the programs is 
handed over to the county, there is the concern that smaller cities such as 
Stanton may get "lost in the larger concept," Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ron Faulkner, program coordinator for La Habra's employment and 
training department, labor and employment markets differ drastically from one 
end of the county to the other, with the North County's focus mostly on smaller 
manufacturing, service and retail jobs, while the South County's employment 
mainstay is large, high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
Given the diversity in labor markets, Faulkner said the concern is that because 
of geographic and manpower constraints, the county would not be able to cater 
to the needs of the individual communities as the present system now does. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what's needed in our own back yard," Faulkner said. The state decided 
Thursday to consolidate local job-training programs under the county's 
administration, but the city of La Habra said it would appeal the decision.

SCHOOL BOARD VOTES TO HIRE AN AUDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange Unified School District, still dogged by the shadow of a 
multimillion-dollar bid-rigging scandal uncovered several years ago, decided 
Thursday night to hire an internal auditor to investigate any allegations of 
wrongdoing in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The school board authorized spending up to $80,000 on the independent auditor. 
The auditor will report directly to the seven-member school board and not to 
the superintendent, an arrangement designed to try to restore credibility to 
the district, according to board president Sandy Englander. 
</P>
<P>
She said the auditor's duties will not be limited to investigating fiscal 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
"They will look into anything we (board members) want," Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
Three board members were accused by the 1986-87 Orange County Grand Jury of 
failing to supervise school district business adequately, thus allowing a 
contract bid-rigging scandal to take place in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The three are Joe Cherry, Ruth Evans and Robert J. Elliott. Their case is 
pending before Superior Court. The other four trustees, including Englander, 
were not on the board at the time. 
</P>
<P>
According to the grand jury and court documents, a school district employee in 
the early 1980s set up a scheme to rig school repair and construction 
contracts. The court documents alleged that millions of dollars in contracts 
went to selected contractors, who in turn gave kickbacks and other favors to 
the employee and his wife. MARIA NEWMAN

MAN FACES 130 YEARS IN $7.7-MILLION FRAUD

<P>
A man accused of fleecing his fellow Capistrano Beach church members and other 
investors of millions by promising them returns of 60% or higher was convicted 
Thursday of fraud charges by a federal jury in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
James B.A. Niven persuaded about 170 investors, many of them members of Calvary 
Chapel, to invest $7.7 million in his company, but after less than five hours 
of deliberation, the jury agreed with prosecutors who said that Niven spent the 
money on himself. 
</P>
<P>
Niven was found guilty on all 24 mail and wire fraud charges and two counts of 
acting as an unregistered securities broker. 
</P>
<P>
Niven, 48, is a native of Scotland. He faces a maximum sentence of 130 years 
when he returns before U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carolyn Kubota said that Niven paid off old investors with 
money deposited by new investors. Because earlier investors saw their accounts 
appear to grow quickly, they seldom asked to withdraw their money until the 
stock market crash in October, 1987, Kubota explained. Catherine Gewertz

GENETIC 'FINGERPRINT' LAB WOULD PAY FOR ITS UPKEEP, REPORT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SUPERVISORS MAY BE SWAYED BY A STUDY DESPITE THE $200,000 PRICE TAG 
BECAUSE DNA ANALYSIS HOLDS PROMISE FOR THE SURE IDENTIFICATION OF CRIMINALS.

<P>
Orange County administrators said Thursday that a genetic testing laboratory 
could be self-sufficient in the future through cost savings and fees for 
services but that $200,000 in private and county money would be needed to start 
the controversial program. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the county administrators followed an emotional meeting 10 days 
ago, when the only woman member of the Board of Supervisors, Harriett M. 
Wieder, questioned her male colleagues' concern for rape victims because of 
their refusal to pay for the genetic "fingerprinting" lab immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Her request for $120,000 to help the Sheriff-Coroner's Department set up a lab 
to check DNA evidence was spurred by the recent rape of a 12-year-old girl in 
Huntington Beach. A suspect held in the case is a man who five months earlier 
had been acquitted of a rape charge after prosecutors were late in obtaining 
evidence from an outside lab based on deoxyribonucleic acid samples. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, echoing the sentiments of his male 
board colleagues, said they favor establishing a DNA lab but are reluctant to 
approve new programs before a January budget review. 
</P>
<P>
DNA, present in everything from hair and skin samples to body fluids, contains 
each person's unique genetic code and thus could help prosecutors tie evidence 
left behind at a crime with a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said Thursday's report may clear the way for supervisors to 
approve the DNA lab Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, officials recommended that the lab be set up in the 
sheriff-coroner's facility in the 1000 block of West Santa Ana Boulevard. 
Equipment and remodeling costs would not exceed $120,000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Another $80,000, which was raised by the Sheriff's Advisory Council from 
private sources for such a lab, would be used to offset the cost of two senior 
criminalist positions for the DNA program. 
</P>
<P>
The report was upbeat about possible cost savings from such a lab. It said 
conclusive evidence from DNA tests will result in an increased number of guilty 
pleas and thus fewer court days. 
</P>
<P>
"A typical hearing lasts a total of 10 days for a cost of $60,000," the report 
said. "A guilty plea based on conclusive DNA testing may reduce the number of 
court days significantly, as well as reduce law enforcement officers' court 
time costs." 
</P>
<P>
The lab would also cut down on expert-witness fees because the DNA testers 
would be county employees, rather than outside experts paid by the hour. The 
lab, according to the report, may well cut in half present analytical costs for 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, alternatives for starting the DNA lab without using 
the county's "overcommitted general fund" include taking money from the Orange 
County Neighborhood Development and Preservation Program Regional Projects. 
</P>
<P>
But once such a lab is in operation, the report said, county staff members are 
"confident that through cost recovery, fees and (gaining state designation as a 
regional genetic testing lab), the county's DNA testing program will be 
self-sufficient in future years."

ENROLLMENT INCREASE MARKS TURNAROUND IN GARDEN GROVE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's growth in enrollment at the Garden Grove Unified School District, 
the county's second-largest, has reversed a 20-year downward trend. 
</P>
<P>
And higher birth rates in the areas served by the district indicate that the 
increase in student enrollment will continue, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from the district's office of business services show an increase of 561 
students this year over last school year, bringing enrollment to 36,725, a 1.6% 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
The district's enrollment peaked in the 1968-69 school year with 53,114, when 
it was then the county's largest district. 
</P>
<P>
A recently released state report examining birth rates projected large 
increases in California's school enrollment. District information officer Alan 
Trudell said that birth rates in the cities the district serves -- Garden 
Grove, and portions of Santa Ana, Westminster, Fountain Valley, Stanton, 
Cypress and Anaheim -- indicate that growth in the district is expected to keep 
going up. 
</P>
<P>
The latest data available shows that in 1987 Garden Grove's birth rate was 19.5 
per 1,000, while for Santa Ana, which provides 25% of the district's children, 
the birth rate was 33.9 per 1,000, nearly twice the county average, Trudell 
said.

DIETERS' TOP CONCERN IS FITNESS, SURVEY SHOWS; 
</P>

TO LOOK GOOD, BUT THESE DAYS THEY ARE CUTTING DOWN TO FEEL GOOD.

Today's dieters are shedding pounds primarily to improve their health, not to 
improve their looks -- a reversal of the reasons for losing weight five years 
ago, a recent Orange County survey reveals. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Weight Watchers of Orange County, appears to reflect 
the public's growing awareness that being overweight can contribute to heart 
disease and other health problems, a spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted in September among 535 Weight Watcher clients, 
asked the question, "What is your main reason for losing weight?" The answer 
given most often -- by 22% -- was to improve health. Five years ago, in the 
same survey, health ranked third -- or 13% -- among the dieters. In last 
month's survey, losing weight to improve appearance ranked fourth out of five 
reasons, while five years ago, that was the most-often mentioned reason. 
</P>
<P>
"When we conducted the last similar survey, people seemed more concerned with 
how they were perceived by others. They desired to lose weight for more 
external reasons," said Kathleen Roberto, public information director for the 
Weight Watchers of Orange County. "Today there seems to be more of a 
consciousness of health. Appearance is taking a back seat." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto attributed the change in attitude to the emphasis placed on fitness and 
health by American society, along with Weight Watchers' health programs and 
with recent reports that link obesity to a number of ailments, including heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
After health, increasing energy and stamina ranked second among reasons for 
losing weight (17%), according to the recent survey. Taking more control of 
one's life (15%), improving appearance (14%) and increasing self-esteem (9%) 
rounded out the rest of the answers. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the reasons were improving appearance (21%), pleasing spouse or 
others (13%), improving health (13%), advancing career (12%) and taking control 
of one's life (7%). 
</P>
<P>
"I do have a feeling that society's leaning toward health issues has played a 
part in the change of attitudes," Roberto said. "In the '80s, people were more 
interested in career advancement and personal appearance. But in the coming 
decade, health and family issues are being stressed. People are more concerned 
with intrinsic influences, rather than a desire to please others." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Parr agrees with that. Thirteen years ago, the 42-year-old woman from 
Orange began her up-and-down battle to shed pounds, but she was not successful 
until she decided she wanted to lose weight not to look better, but to feel 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"I just noticed such a change in how I felt when I began eating the right 
foods, and even in how I looked, as far as my complexion was concerned, after 
drinking the recommended amount of water," Parr said. "I was constantly losing 
20 pounds, then gaining 25 back, until I started actually eating the right 
foods and exercising for my body's health sake." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Schnabel of Tustin admits that changing her attitude about weight loss 
made dropping the pounds and keeping a healthly heart much easier. 
</P>
<P>
"It just gets to a point when you realize that your body isn't going to last 
forever," Schnabel said. "So you start cutting down on the sugar and the fatty 
foods and start trying to do many different exercises to aid your condition."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THE WRONG PLACE FOR DRUNKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County has never properly handled the problem of public drunks. The 
approach being taken in Garden Grove re-emphasizes the need to start providing 
treatment instead of jail time. 
</P>
<P>
In what is believed to be the first program of its kind in the nation, the 
Garden Grove City Council authorized police this week to begin charging anyone 
taken to the City Jail for public intoxication what it costs police to make an 
arrest, process the case and watch over people until they are released about 
four to six hours later. The budget-strapped city is trying to recover as much 
as possible of the estimated $120,000 it spends on public drunks. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for police in Garden Grove, as in other cities, is that they pick 
up about 400 people every year for public intoxication and have no place to 
take them. Because of its overcrowded conditions, County Jail is no longer 
accepting public drunks, so cities must keep them in police station holding 
tanks until they are sober enough to be released. In many cases, drunks are 
freed without formal charges being filed, so their time in jail is considered 
detention, not arrest. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter what you call time spent in a holding tank, it comes out of the 
police budget. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is that public drunks never should be taken to any kind of 
jail cell in the first place. That approach is not only economically unsound 
but socially insensitive and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
Public drunks are not criminals. They are people with a medical problem who 
need treatment and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County -- despite urging from past grand juries, the county sheriff, 
health officials and community leaders -- still denies people with drinking 
problems the medical help they should be receiving. Unlike its more enlightened 
Los Angeles and San Diego neighbors, Orange County still has no detoxification 
centers. County leaders have talked about developing jail diversion programs 
for public drunks for years. Studies have been made. But no action has been 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
As long as public officials continue to pay only lip service to the need, and 
the public resists efforts to locate sobering-up stations in their 
neighborhoods, public drunks will continue to create a problem that will in the 
long run cost the community much more than the jail costs the city seeks to 
recover.

The basic issue with chiropractors is: "Does chiropractic care, such as spinal 
manipulation, really result in cost-effective treatment of musculoskeletal 
problems?" 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona were mandated by the state to allow 
chiropractic care for state-mandated insurance programs several years ago. When 
they went back and looked at the cost of chiropractic care they found that for 
the same conditions treated by general practitioners or orthopaedic surgeons 
versus chiropractors, the cost of chiropractic care was two to three times 
greater than the medical doctors' care. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this evidence, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona have 
arbitrarily limited chiropractic care in their medical programs because of the 
fear of runaway costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lost somewhere between adulation and relief, the members of the Mission Viejo 
High School football team walked off their home field Thursday, having just 
beaten -- and that's just beaten -- Dana Hills, 6-0, in the South Coast League 
opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
No one was happier or more relieved than a stocky fullback named Ryan Darke, 
who looked as if the weight of the world -- at least the part that encompasses 
Orange County high school football -- had been lifted from his shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
Darke had fumbled twice in the second half, once when his team had the ball at 
the Dana Hills 15. Darke's mistakes were by no means the only ones for Mission 
Viejo. The Diablos, who came into the game 5-0 and ranked No. 1 in Orange 
County, were penalized 13 times for 128 yards, turned the ball over four times 
and missed three field goals. 
</P>
<P>
But Darke's mistakes were conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
"Each time I fumbled it killed a drive we could have easily scored on," he 
said. "I was really fighting being down about it mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Darke vindicated himself when he went downfield and ran under a 
pass from quarterback Tom Snowden with little more than three minutes left in 
the game. Catching the ball at the 15, Darke sprinted into the end zone, 
finishing a 48-yard play and scoring the game's only touchdown. The extra point 
was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't planned," Darke said. "The defense was playing me 'man' so I just 
turned it up and Tom read it perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Snowden's read was all the more impressive since he did it as four Dana Hills 
defenders were closing in on him. Dana Hills (5-1), a team that had allowed 
just 23 points coming into Thursday's game, had hit Snowden hard all game, 
sacking him twice and intercepting him twice. Still, the junior quarterback 
completed 15 of 29 passes for 249 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Darke was also Mission Viejo's leading rusher on the night, gaining 62 yards on 
13 carries. He gained 40 yards of that in the second half when he filled in at 
tailback for Mark Gaw, who missed the second half with a hip bruise. Gaw gained 
39 yards on seven carries in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo wasn't the only team making mistakes. Dana Hills quarterback 
Grant Taylor was intercepted three times and sacked five times for losses 
totaling 41 yards. And Dana Hills missed a field goal of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think the turnovers came about because it was a hard hitting ball 
game," said Don Douglass, Dana Hills coach. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not that was true, Douglass' team was in the game right until 
Taylor's pass to running back Scott Pearlman lost 10 yards on fourth down at 
the Mission Viejo 38 with less than a minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of happy this kind of game happened to our kids," said Mike Rush, 
Mission Viejo coach. "They have to learn they can't assume anything." 
</P>
<P>
Though both teams came into the game at 5-0, Mission Viejo was considered a 
heavy favorite, having won the past two South Coast League championships and 
outscored five previous opponents, 186-25. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great football game," Douglass said. "My kids play hard every game 
and that makes it an awful lot of fun for me." 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one was having as much fun after it was over as Darke who buried his 
head in his hands immediately after the game had ended then gave out a scream. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very nice the way things worked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nice and close.

As if to underscore the moment, George Pascoe let out a loud "whoooooooop!" 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High School had just defeated Edison, 24-14, in front of 5,000 
Thursday at Orange Coast College and it was a victory worth screaming about. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration raged all around Pascoe, Huntington Beach coach. Players 
hugged, coaches hugged players, fans hugged, all savoring the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice, it was fun," said Pascoe, trying to translate his feelings into 
the King's English. "I went to Fountain Valley. It's always fun to beat 
Edison." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, a victory gives Huntington Beach a slight edge in the Sunset 
League championship race. Huntington Beach is 5-1 overall, 1-0 in league play; 
Edison is 3-3, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Cunningham, Huntington Beach's senior running back, said he hadn't been on 
an Oiler team that had defeated Edison since he playing on the freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
"We won in the last five seconds," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Cunningham, Huntington Beach didn't have to pull out a last-second 
victory Thursday night. He rushed for 82 yards in 18 carries and caught six 
passes for 98 more. He scored on a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff 
Gibson in the second quarter that helped Huntington Beach to a 14-6 halftime 
lead. He added a three-yard touchdown run for a 21-6 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've been through a war," Cunningham said. "But it's worth it. 
It's pay-back time." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham certainly played as if past failures against Edison were fresh in 
his mind. Every time Huntington Beach needed a big play, he came up with one. 
</P>
<P>
His diving catch along the sidelines for a 24-yard gain set up his scoring pass 
from Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, his 48-yard run set up a 30-yard field goal by Tony 
Canini that clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Oiler defense allowed just one touchdown and two field goals, one that had 
to be seen to be believed. They slowed Shane Sherman, Edison's running back who 
gained a school-record 308 yards last week in a victory over St. John Bosco. He 
had 108 yards in 22 carries, but just five gains of five yards or more.

LA QUINTA HOLDS ON TO DEFEAT KENNEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
How nerve-wracked was La Quinta High School's football team Thursday night as 
it watched Kennedy attempt a fourth-quarter rally? 
</P>
<P>
Consider the La Quinta players on the sidelines, screaming at each other in 
disgust: "We shoulda killed 'em! We shoulda had four more touchdowns! You don't 
want it enough . . . !" 
</P>
<P>
And the La Quinta coaches, shouting at the players in rapid-fire commands. And 
don't forget the La Quinta ball boy, dropping down on one knee, looking up 
toward the sky while solemnly making the sign of the cross. 
</P>
<P>
All this and more capped La Quinta's 20-14 Garden Grove League victory over 
Kennedy at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
Until the fourth quarter, La Quinta dominated the game, with Trent Julian 
scoring touchdowns on a 47-yard play pass from Richard Weaver and on a one-yard 
run, and Matt Logan kicking field goals of 49 and 22 yards to give La Quinta a 
20-0. 
</P>
<P>
But after three quarters of lackluster play, Kennedy finally found its groove. 
After driving to the La Quinta two and fumbling the ball away, Kennedy mad a 
fumble recovery of its own moments later and then scored on a one-yard run by 
Vince Church. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Kennedy's Craig Road intercepted Richard Weaver at midfield 
and ran the ball back 45 yards for the touchdown. Scott Jones' kick cut 
Kennedy's deficit to 20-14 with 8:52 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy didn't let up, and with a minute to go, started its final drive. On a 
24-yard reception from Kennedy quarterback Russ Clark, Church took the Fighting 
Irish to the 39. 
</P>
<P>
With 46 seconds left, Clark looked for a receiver in the end zone, but he was 
rushed and the pass was knocked away. With 18 seconds left, Clark was sacked, 
and on the final play, La Quinta junior safety Don Hopkins intercepted a pass 
by Clark in the end zone to end the game.

LOARA ROLLS PAST ESPERANZA

<P>
Loara Coach Herb Hill impressed a motto upon his team all week at practice, in 
preparation for the Saxons' Empire League opener against Esperanza: "Make 
something happen." 
</P>
<P>
Boy, did they ever. 
</P>
<P>
Loara tailback Coy Collins rushed for a school-record 266 yards in 21 carries, 
and the Saxons forced two fumbles and intercepted Esperanza's Keith McDonald 
once on the way to a 30-24 victory in front of 900 at Valencia High School 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' effort broke his own school record of 203 yards, set in the season's 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
"He can run," Hill said. "He makes a good coach out of me." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Sean Conner completed four of nine passes for 88 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 14-12, at halftime the Saxons broke the game open in the third 
quarter when they tight end their defense and scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Loara (4-0-1, 1-0) took the lead early. On the first play of the game Collins 
ran for 55 yards. Two plays later Conner scored on a keeper and Loara led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Banta forced the first of two fumbles by Esperanza's Lance Brown midway 
through the first quarter and Kweli Campbell recovered for Loara. That set up 
the Saxon's second score, on a 35-yard pass from Conner to Greg Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza mounted 70- and 85-yard drives to take a 14-12 lead at the half, 
mostly on the strength of Brown, who carried 22 times for 162 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Loara could have gone ahead late in the half after a 48-yard run by Collins 
moved them to the Esperanza 18, but on a fourth-and-one play at the nine a 
Conner pass fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half Esperanza marched from its 38 to the Saxon 13 before Loara's 
defense finally got on track. The Aztec's settled for a 30-yard field goal by 
Mike Brown to lead 17-12. 
</P>
<P>
"They blocked the hell out of us in the first half," said Hill of Esperanza's 
offensive line. "We made some adjustments and played much better against their 
running game in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Three carries for 75 yards by Collins helped the Saxons get in scoring position 
and David Kang's one-yard run early in the third put Loara ahead for good, 
18-17. 
</P>
<P>
Jarod Smith then fumbled and Ramsey recovered for Loara at the Aztec 36. Conner 
eventually scored on a four-yard keeper.

GROUNDED SANTA ANA VALLEY WINS

<TEXT>
<P>
It's doubtful anyone on the sidelines was surprised at the method Santa Ana 
Valley High School used to defeat Canyon, 31-0, Thursday night at Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, Santa Ana Valley stayed on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons (2-3-1, 1-0) did try five passes in 44 plays, completing three. 
Quarterback James Stewart threw an 21-yard touchdown pass to Scottie Strong and 
backup Gary Graves completed two passes in two attempts for 40 yards, but it 
was a runner's night for Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Jessie Brooks, who gained 178 yards in 26 carries, Santa Ana Valley 
punished Canyon (2-4) in the Century League opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
It was a simple game plan, one painfully apparent to Canyon Coach Loren Shumer. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that they had good fast backs," Shumer said. "We knew we had to close 
down their running game and we couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said the offensive simplicity was designed 
to get his team back to basics after some experimentation in nonleague games. 
</P>
<P>
"We just said, 'Forget it, it is league time and we're just going to pound the 
ball,' " Castanon said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks did most of the pounding. He scored two touchdowns, one on a 10-yard run 
in the second quarter that put the Falcons ahead, 17-0, and the second on a 
one-yard dive that closed the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley's other running back, Henry Bratton, returned the opening 
kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. Bratton caught the ball nearby one sideline, 
ran across the field to the other sideline and ran into the end zone without 
much interference. Bratton also rushed for 48 yards on 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon had difficultly recovering from that beginning. Canyon quarterback Chuck 
Nickerson was facing a daunting defense and not faring very well. Nickerson, 
who completed eight of 17 passes for 88 yards, was sacked seven times and threw 
two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Yorki Tafulu was a big reason for Nickerson's problems. Tafulu, a 180-pound 
lineman, sacked Nickerson three times in the first half. One of the sacks 
caused a Nickerson fumble that the Falcons recovered. Tafulu also recovered a 
fumble and returned the ball nine yards.

NEW CHEFS ADD SPICE TO PATIENTS' MEALS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITALS: HIRING TOP-FLIGHT COOKS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF FOOD HAS PROVEN TO 
BE A GREAT MARKETING TOOL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On occasional pre-dawn excursions to the Los Angeles produce mart, chef 
Dietrich W. Hoffmann searches for vegetables that meet his finicky standards. 
Competing with him for the finest, freshest produce are the chefs of swank 
private restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But Hoffmann, a certified executive chef belonging to an elite society of 
culinary artists called the Chaine des Rotisseurs, is on a slightly different 
mission. The produce he buys is destined for the patients and staff of FHP 
Hospital in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is too good for the patient trays and employee cafeterias at FHP and 
many other medical centers throughout the nation. In these facilities, jokes 
about bad hospital food are becoming a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Today, an increasing number of hospitals nationwide are putting on the Ritz in 
their culinary departments. In Orange County, at least five medical facilities 
-- FHP Hospital, Anaheim Memorial Hospital, United Western Medical Centers of 
Santa Ana and Anaheim, and Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin -- employ 
professionally trained executive chefs. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals are jazzing up patient food to help fill beds. And they are improving 
the quality of their cafeteria and catering services to project a better image 
in the community and generate revenue. Hospital food services, which 
traditionally lose money, are striving to become self-supporting or even 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Memorial Hospital employs a chef who, with a dietitian, is developing a 
tasty heart-healthy, low-fat and low-salt menu for the employee cafeteria and 
has upgraded the fare in the doctors' dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin offers lamb shank, mahi mahi in a tropical 
fruit glaze, veal Oscar and beef Wellington to patients who eat from trays 
lined with linen napkins and set with china. Its chef formerly worked at Chez 
Cary, a highly rated restaurant in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana will prepare a five-course gourmet 
dinner for a patient and guest on 24-hour notice. The dinner is served in the 
patient's room by waiters wearing white shirts, red vests and bow ties. The 
price: $13 for patients, $15 for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-City Medical Center, a 440-bed hospital in Oceanside, offers a catering 
service that strives for the quality of a four-star hotel. 
</P>
<P>
As hospitals cope with a growing number of empty beds and compete for patients, 
they are finding that fresh fish and vegetables and chocolate mousse can be an 
effective marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
And partly because hospitals have fewer patients to cook for, they are turning 
their attention more to expanding their cafeteria and catering businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospital officials say they are accomplishing all this at minimum, or no 
added, cost beyond the salary of a chef, which ranges from $30,000 to $45,000 a 
year. The use of fresh food and attractive garnishing requires more talent in 
the kitchen, but not necessarily more funds, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Carpe, a hospital consultant at the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp; 
Horvath, said he thinks culinary improvement is a cost-effective method for 
hospitals to boost business. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that "food is one of the biggest single areas of complaints that 
patients have. When you are hospitalized, the one thing you look forward to is 
a meal." 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Sullivan, who negotiates food purchases for hospitals that belong to a 
subsidiary of the Hospital Council of Southern California, said many 
institutions are advertising their new talents by catering events for service 
clubs in their communities and giving senior citizen discounts in their 
cafeterias. The hope is that these people will remember the good food and 
return as patients if they later need hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first steps many hospitals take to improve their product is to hire 
a trained chef to take charge of their food production. Hospital kitchens 
traditionally have been run by dietitians and people trained in hotel and 
restaurant management. They may know how to create balanced meals quickly and 
in large volume but not how to make the food look and taste good. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the cooking staffs at hospitals "come through the armies or have 
short-order experience, but have not had formal training," said Patricia 
Burton, assistant director of the American Society for Hospital Food Services 
Administrators. She believes the hiring of chefs is "a positive change." 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Leary, regional vice president of Food Dimensions Inc., a West Coast food 
management company with 32 hospital and retirement home clients in Southern 
California, estimates that fewer than 5% of Southern California hospitals have 
chefs. But that percentage is expanding rapidly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chefs who are taking the jobs say they have been drawn from restaurants, hotels 
and cruise lines by the shorter workweek and greater medical and retirement 
benefits that hospitals offer. William Jacoby, director of education for the 
American Culinary Federation, said he has noticed "a lot of interest" among 
chefs to work for hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Partly in response to the trend, the federation, which sets the certification 
standards for chefs in the United States, has added a requirement that all 
chefs receive a minimum of 30 hours of instruction in nutrition by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Chefs say that cooking for hospital patients, many of whom have restricted 
diets and depressed appetites, offers a special challenge. "The challenge is to 
be just as creative with low-sugar, low-salt and other special diets. You have 
to be smarter," Jacoby said.

<P>
Sometimes called "the culinary guru of hospital food service," Donald C. Miller 
was recruited to Tri-City three years ago to turn its food service around. "The 
food had no pizazz. It was very bland and unappealing," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller brought in lots of fresh fish, chicken and vegetables. Because most 
hospital patients are elderly and not interested in "French food with names 
they wouldn't understand," he said he decided to keep the menu simple. But he 
said the patients appreciated such gestures as fresh squeezed orange juice and 
homemade muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital employees who use the cafeteria showed their appreciation at the cash 
register for such touches as fresh graded Parmesan cheese and homemade Mexican 
salsa. In less than two years, Miller said, the cafeteria's annual revenue 
jumped from $400,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Catering has also doubled at Tri-City, Miller said. "We now have the Kiwanis 
Club, Rotary, junior chamber of commerce and the like holding their meetings 
here because our food is better than local restaurants'," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chefs are well worth their salaries, said Steve Porter, associate executive 
director of Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin. He said his hospital and 15 
others scattered throughout the country that are operated by Healthcare 
International of Austin, Tex., have seen their food costs drop by 7% to 8% 
since they hired chefs. Fresh foods are less costly than processed products, he 
said, and chefs know how to "do more for less" by reducing waste. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Wolz-Clements, food service director at Anaheim Memorial Hospital, said 
that after the hospital hired a chef, it improved the grade of its Sunday filet 
mignon. That was done without added cost, she said, because the chef bought a 
whole tenderloin and butchered it into individual portions rather than buying 
pre-cut meat. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring a chef is not every hospital's choice. Leslie Jenkin, director of food 
services at Saddleback Hospital and Health Center, said she is sending the 
hospital's cooks to gourmet cooking schools instead. "We find it is beneficial 
to take people who know institutional cooking and teach them culinary skills," 
she said. "Chefs are very highly paid and sometimes difficult to work with, and 
they often don't understand the need for teamwork or for speed." 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't been the experience of Westcott W. Price, president and vice 
chairman of FHP, a health maintenance organization with almost 500,000 members. 
Not only has its chef, Dietrich Hoffmann, been well received by the kitchen 
staff, but the hospital reaped an immediate 15% gain in its cafeteria and 
catering business. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who had been recruited from the restaurant field to enhance FHP's 
reputation for good service, hired Hoffmann last January, first as a consultant 
and later as FHP's full-time chef. "We conducted a nationwide search and got 
literally hundreds of top-quality chefs who applied for the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have the patients' food the same level as any fine hotel," said 
Hoffmann, previously a chef for the Commodore and Admiral Cruise Lines. His 
upgrading included changing choice meat to prime, frozen chicken to fresh and 
veal patties to veal loin "that you can cut with a fork." And he has spent many 
hours teaching the kitchen staff how to make such things as strawberry Romanoff 
and fillet of sole with crab meat sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Howard, a Chino Hills woman recovering from surgery at FHP Hospital, 
appreciated the improved cuisine as she dined Thursday on steak and asparagus. 
"It helps with your recovery knowing you are going to have a decent meal."

It looks as if construction of new homes and apartments will be down in Orange 
County this year. That is the tale new figures from the Construction Industry 
Research Board tell. 
</P>
<P>
As of August, with a third of 1989 left, builders had obtained building permits 
for just 11,534 units. Last year -- for the entire year -- builders obtained 
23,455; the year before they got 24,698. 
</P>
<P>
Permits are an approximate indicator of construction activity because most 
units are built within a few months of obtaining a permit. Here is how this 
year's permits break down through August: Houses accounted for 5,903 permits, 
while such attached housing as condominiums and apartments totaled 5,631.

Two new industrial parks are under construction in the central part of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Co., the Newport Beach mega-developer, said it had bought the Golden 
Grain Macaroni Co. warehouse near Anaheim Stadium and will build 11 industrial 
buildings on the seven-acre site. The warehouse will be converted into another 
industrial building. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million project on the southeast corner of Cerritos Avenue and Lewis 
Street in Anaheim will be called Anaheim Business Center. Koll Construction, a 
subsidiary, is general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
And in Santa Ana, Hamilton Co. of Newport Beach and Cal Fed Enterprises is 
building the $2.7-million Lake Center Business Park at 3500 Lake Center Drive. 
The project will contain 16 buildings. The general contractor is Elliott Corp. 
of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Both industrial parks will be completed next year.

'ALCHEMIST' TRANSMUTED DOESN'T GLITTER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You had to smile, learning that actor-playwright Gregory Mortensen had adapted 
Ben Jonson's Renaissance London comedy, "The Alchemist," into a Gold Rush-era 
San Francisco comedy called "The Scoundrel." 
</P>
<P>
Jonson, Shakespeare's chief rival, is rarely done anymore, and when he is, it's 
usually "Volpone." His comedy is caustic, mellowed only by a lilting verse 
style. It would be nice to hear actors deal with the original Jonson, but we'll 
take any updating with a title like "The Scoundrel." 
</P>
<P>
It suggests some really nasty business -- a wilder version of Jonson. Then why 
does everything feel so reined in at the Grove Shakespeare Festival's Gem 
Theatre? 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a new problem at this theater. Two summers ago, on its outdoor 
stage, the Grove did a very safe updating of Moliere's "The Imaginary Invalid." 
Its New Orleans setting did nothing to spark the actors, or make us think of 
Moliere in a new way. So why update it? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the suspicion is that the classics in original dress will scare away the 
crowds (remember, this is the same theater whose funding last year was 
threatened by city officials). You hope that you're wrong, but it's hard to 
find any other justification for doing Jonson with a soft underbelly. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Mortensen's adaptation has clever touches, beginning with the sense 
that the Barbary Coast is ripe for a farce about swindlers and those they 
hoodwink. Jonson's alchemist, Subtle, told his customers that he could make 
gold, and gold is the reason for the San Francisco boom town. Mortensen has 
changed the names -- Subtle is now Dr. Alerdyce T. Smooth (Daniel Bryan 
Cartmell), his assistant Face is now Lucien Marmott (Mortensen), partner Dol 
Common is now Cassie Spooner (Cherie Brown). The characters, vices and motives 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
The big motive is to swindle as many folks out of their gold as soon as 
possible before Lucien's master returns from the sea. Underneath, Lucien and 
Smooth have designs on each other. There is no one scoundrel in "The 
Scoundrel." In fact, Mortensen's ending one-ups Jonson for farcical cynicism, 
and it's here that we get a sense of the real Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, things are awfully tame. Stripped of the verse and the characters' 
florid visions of their own fortunes, "The Alchemist" is essentially a series 
of episodes where the con men dupe various innocents, and then the tables are 
turned on them. "The Scoundrel" is just that stripped-down version, without new 
twists. Good farce, even if it has episodes, makes us rise above them. 
</P>
<P>
Mortensen might have a better farce, though, with a production that took more 
risks. Director Thomas F. Bradac has a conservative sensibility, which is the 
right one for some plays, but not for this one. Both Cartmell and Mortensen, 
two Grove stalwarts, look and sound uninspired, despite all of their delicious 
costume changes. Their movements are too studied and careful for the farce to 
fly, which has a chain-reaction effect on the ensemble. Brown's Cassie should 
be a ribald hussy, but she strikes us as anachronistically middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
A few actors loosen the reins a bit, and express themselves. We know Bud 
Leslie's perplexed shop owner is in for big trouble the second he walks in the 
door, and he's perfectly counterbalanced by Rick Tigert's fatuous Sir Egmont, 
who is the closest thing here to what Jonson had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Morales' set also looks hemmed in, missing the indulgent splendor that the 
Gold Rush winners enjoyed. But indulgence, or the dream of it, is what we have 
to see if the comedy is to work at all. The ingredients are here, but it feels 
like fool's gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grove Shakespeare Festival's production of "The Scoundrel" is playing 
through Nov. 4 at the Gem Theatre, 12852 Main St., Garden Grove. Performances 
Wednesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $16 to 
$20; (714) 636-7213.

WHY ARTS COUNCILS MUST ATTRACT ETHNIC MEMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL, WHICH CONTROLS GRANT MONEY, CRITICIZES 
AS INADEQUATE THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES ON CULTURAL BOARDS OF DIRECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a sensitive subject. People admit nervousness when asked to talk about it. 
"It strikes terror in my heart," one woman said. 
</P>
<P>
But arts organizations in California, indeed, nationwide, have been talking 
about it a lot more lately. It has to do with the color of one's skin, with 
numbers and ratios. 
</P>
<P>
The subject is the number of racial minorities who serve as board members for 
the large museums, orchestras, theater troupes, dance companies and other major 
arts organizations. The catalytic agent here is the California Arts Council, 
whose job it is to distribute $13.5 million in arts subsidies statewide this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The number of minorities on some boards has been too low for too long, charges 
the council, which this year slashed its grant to Costa Mesa's South Coast 
Repertory by 23% from 1988 -- despite top praise for artistic and managerial 
strength -- in part because of weak "ethnic diversity" on the theater's board 
and staff. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of diversity on arts boards, entities that set the tone for institutions 
and shape programming in conjunction with paid staff, is a national problem, 
many experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Continued and increasing efforts to include minorities on the staff, on the 
boards and in the audiences of the nation's cultural life have met with only 
very limited success," wrote Robert Garfias, an anthropology professor at UC 
Irvine, in a report to the National Endowment for the Arts on cultural 
diversity and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that many organizations feel the need to have minorities on 
their boards in order to comply," said Garfias, who serves on the National 
Council on the Arts. "But the reason (to seek diversity) is not simply to 
comply, but to hear what these people have to say." 
</P>
<P>
During a California Arts Council meeting in August, just before the vote that 
reduced SCR's grant, council member Consuelo Santos Killins issued the 
strongest statement on the topic ever made by a council official. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last time I'm going to vote to fund applications for large-budget 
organizations unless board of directors' makeup starts to change radically," 
Killins said. 
</P>
<P>
Three minorities serve on SCR's 48-member board, according to data used by the 
council to determine 1989-90 organizational grants to 34 groups with budgets of 
$1 million or more. The data may have changed slightly since sent to the 
council by these groups last year, but overall, boards statewide still aren't 
much more integrated than SCR's, and sometimes they are much less. 
</P>
<P>
SCR vigorously protested its decreased grant of $81,950. But the council stood 
firm, noting that the situation on some boards has not improved at all over 
several years, even though all 34 big-budget groups have been told repeatedly 
to make their boards better reflect California's multi-ethnic population. 
</P>
<P>
Among other organizations' board compositions: One minority sits on the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic's 35-member board; the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary 
Art's 26-member board includes one member of a racial minority; three sit on 
the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco's 27-member board. 
</P>
<P>
This year, a council panel that evaluates grant applications sent word to all 
but two of these groups that, in the panel's view, need to better integrate 
their boards. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Newport Harbor Art Museum, which added five minority board members 
this past year, did not receive the panel's comment. But the evaluation on 
Costa Mesa-based Opera Pacific, like SCR and Santa Ana-based Pacific Symphony, 
read: "Their board needs further diversification." 
</P>
<P>
The county's single largest arts organization, the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, is privately funded and, therefore, subject to none of the 
California Arts Council's scrutiny as to its board makeup. The Center has one 
minority person on its 52-member board. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick says that fund-raising 
ability, not ethnic diversity, is the chief concern of the Center's board in 
aligning new members. As an institution that presents arts from "Anglo/European 
traditions . . . clearly you are going to more easily find people (from that 
group) to give to that than (people) from specific ethnic cultures," Kendrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to CAC grant procedure, board diversity is a vital element of 
community outreach activities, such as free concerts for low-income 
schoolchildren, that bring arts to the under-served. 
</P>
<P>
For smaller arts organizations with budgets of up to $1 million, outreach is 
suggested, but not mandatory. But for the state's largest institutions, which 
annually win the heftiest grants and serve the largest audiences, it is a 
prerequisite for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
Why is outreach -- and specifically board diversity -- a council concern? 
</P>
<P>
Because as a tax-supported state agency, "it is our legislative mandate to 
serve all the people of California," said Killins, of San Jose. "The board is a 
legal policy-making body in the arts so it has to be participated in by all 
constituents, not just one segment. 
</P>
<P>
"People say we have to have (minorities on boards) because of the state's 
demographics," Killins said. "Demographics are important, but the main reason 
for it is we have to have all constituencies in on the decision-making and in 
on the hard work and responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The CAC sets no quotas for evaluating ethnic diversity on boards. And, to help 
determine grant size, it scrutinizes board makeup not by itself, but as one 
aspect of an organization's total outreach picture. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "we have not seen the kind of progress we would hope for," said CAC 
Executive Director Robert H. Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Board diversity "is not something one does overnight," said Gerald Yoshitomi, a 
council member from Los Angeles. "But over four or five years, people have gone 
through four or five board nominations, and in some cases, obviously not made 
many changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you see the strides made by an institution like Newport Harbor Art 
Museum, which is in the same community as South Coast Repertory. That says if 
it's possible for Newport, it should be possible for other folks in the area." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, there are 12 minority persons (or 7.4%) among 161 board 
members on four large-budget arts organizations that receive state subsidies, 
according to the council. It defines minorities as African Americans, American 
Indians, Chicano/Latinos and Asian/Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
But even that low figure is slightly inflated by the fact that some individuals 
may serve on more than one board. Cal State Fullerton President Jewel Plummer 
Cobb, for instance, sits on the boards of Newport Harbor Art Museum and Pacific 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, minorities make up 26.7% of Orange County's population, 
according to the National Planning Data Corp., which estimates that number will 
rise to 29.8% by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the state, 101 (or 7.8%) of 1,293 arts board members are from 
minorities. Statewide, minorities make up about 38.4% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, officials at the major state-funded arts organizations say they've 
made progress in board diversity and stress that they intend to go further. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all these groups have outreach activities. They range from SCR's 
Hispanic Playwrights Project, which helps young Latino writers produce their 
works in mainstream resident theaters, to Opera Pacific's children's 
presentations about the dangers of drug abuse, to Pacific Symphony's free 
concerts given in the county's Latino community, a program guided in part by an 
eight-member Latino advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the big question looms: Why do Anglos continue to hold the vast majority 
of seats on arts groups' boards? 
</P>
<P>
Many Orange County arts officials say that board members are selected first and 
foremost for an abiding interest in the art form, not for ethnicity or other 
secondary concerns, and that finding such leaders takes time. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnicity is an important criterion we have in seeking leadership," said David 
Emmes, producing artistic director of Tony-winning South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
But, Emmes stressed, probably the most important criterion is that prospective 
board members "are capable of providing the kind of community leadership we 
need and have demonstrated their interest in supporting professional resident 
theater." Accordingly, "we will move forward to meet (the council's requests 
for diversity) when we can and in conjunction with being responsible to the 
needs of this theater." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Symphony board President Randy Johnson said a general lack of interest 
in Western classical music makes finding minorities for his orchestra's board 
especially challenging. Two minority persons sit on Pacific Symphony's 
42-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Asserting that only 2% of the total population regularly attends classical 
music concerts, Johnson said that figure is even less encouraging among 
minority populations. "There are many people, particularly among minorities, 
who do not have a cultural tradition of listening to classical music," said 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose if someone told me to find (several minority board members) between 
now and Jan. 1, I'm sure we could probably do that," he said. "But the most 
crucial thing is finding someone interested in the symphony." 
</P>
<P>
David DiChiera, general manager of Opera Pacific, echoed the notion. 
</P>
<P>
Now starting its fourth season, "Opera Pacific is a very young organization," 
DiChiera said. "What we've been doing in these first years is simply to find 
people who want to support the opera company and who are interested in its 
growth, rather than focusing on who they are or what they represent." 
</P>
<P>
But Ruth Ding, a founding board member of the troupe and leading supporter of 
local Asian cultural groups, had another idea about why she is one of only two 
minority persons among 38 Opera Pacific board members: 
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific requires board members to make personal donations, though not all 
organizations do. Ding said that most minorities are not wealthy enough to meet 
those demands. 
</P>
<P>
Ding said that last year she gave Opera Pacific $2,000 and hopes to give the 
same amount this year. But "minorities often don't have the means to give that 
much. If my husband did not have the money," she said, "I could not sit on the 
board. You have to donate a certain amount each year." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Killins rejects the defense she hears from arts groups that they 
can't find minorities because minorities aren't wealthy enough. Personal 
contribution is not what it's all about, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know some minorities that aren't wealthy but that are able to move and raise 
a great deal of money. And when you think of the economic clout of Hispanics in 
California, you're missing the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ding said last year she raised $60,000 for Opera Pacific and hopes to 
raise $100,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
But one man who is a major fund-raiser for local Latino political, cultural and 
community causes, who is also an Orange County minority board member, disagreed 
with Killins. Insisting on anonymity, he said that in the Latino community, 
raising money for the arts is most difficult of all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of priorities. We do have Hispanics with affluence and 
discretionary income in Orange County, but there are so many needs or perceived 
needs in the Hispanic community. It is very easy to raise $5,000 for academic 
scholarships or amnesty, but (getting) $5,000 for the arts is very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts groups need to make some adjustments. I don't mean lower their standards, 
but they should understand that Hispanics don't have access to large amounts of 
money they can bring to an organization." But, he added, they can serve on 
boards in other important ways. 
</P>
<P>
Council Director Reid agreed -- in part. "The assumption that only Caucasians 
can raise money is fallacious," he said. But he does not believe, contrary to 
what he is told by grant applicants, that money -- giving it or raising it -- 
is the "basic" duty of a board member. 
</P>
<P>
"Boards function as more than just entities to raise money," he said. "Their 
responsibilities also include guiding institutions artistically, providing the 
leadership that hires the professional staff." 
</P>
<P>
No officials at major local arts groups questioned whether it is fair for the 
council to ask for greater board diversity in Orange County, where the 
percentage of minorities is lower than it is statewide. 
</P>
<P>
SCR's Emmes, however, said that "it might be easier to find leadership" within 
the black community if there were more blacks in Orange County. (Blacks 
represent 1.2% of the county's population.) 
</P>
<P>
But state-funded groups have an obligation to make their boards reflect "what 
the state looks like, whether a community does or does not have a particular 
percentage of an ethnic population," Reid said. "Certainly Orange County is 
looking for tourists to come to its cultural institutions." 
</P>
<P>
One black arts figure said that officials at county arts organizations aren't 
working hard enough to add blacks to their boards. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are reaching out to get them, I don't know about it," said Adleane 
Hunter, executive director of the Black Actors Theater, the county's only black 
theater troupe. She has never been asked to join a local board, nor been asked 
to recommend anyone for such a position, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While the issue of board diversity continues to concern arts officials 
nationwide, local leaders offer some solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the arts organizations should make it known to the Hispanic community 
that they are in good faith seeking memberships on their board," said Rodolfo 
Montejano, a Pacific Symphony board member. 
</P>
<P>
"At least 500 to 1,000 Latinos in Orange County" with interests in the arts and 
time to serve can be contacted through such Santa Ana-based organizations as 
the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, 
the Santiago Club and the Relampago del Cielo dance troupe, Montejano said. 
</P>
<P>
Council member Killins said she is working with the council on a manual "that 
will teach people how to do develop outreach." The booklet will include 
information on how organizations seeking to diversify their boards can find 
qualified minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Minority advisory panels, such as Pacific Symphony's Hispanic committee, are a 
good way to develop ties with minority communities and find board members, said 
Tere Romo, council organizational grants program manager. 
</P>
<P>
But the long-term solution -- to board diversity and an overall cultural 
diversity -- essentially boils down to more diverse arts programming, Romo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the state's changing demographics, the product performed on stage or 
displayed in galleries must be expanded beyond "Western European" art forms in 
order for arts groups to thrive, "or even to sell tickets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If arts groups hold onto a very narrow viewpoint of culture, they are not 
going to build audiences or find board members who want to commit all that time 
or money to promote something that has nothing to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
Some institutions have made progress in this regard, but some still take a 
missionary approach and far too few regularly integrate arts from other 
cultures into their programs and, critically, collaborate with ethnic groups to 
present works with them, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
"The council would like to see that major institutions create bridges to ethnic 
communities so that it's a two-way street, so that culture is going both ways." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
"Developing Multicultural Boards: Experiences and Opportunities," a panel on 
how to develop executive and advisory boards of art institutions "that 
adequately reflect the cultural make-up of the community," will be held 7:30 to 
9:30 p.m. Monday at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, 
Sumitomo room, 244 S. San Pedro St., downtown Los Angeles. Speakers are Jerry 
Allen, executive director, the Yerba Buena Center, San Francisco; Hansonia 
Caldwell, dean of fine arts and humanities, Cal State Dominguez Hills, and 
Willow Young, independent arts and culture consultant. Sponsored by ArtTable 
Inc., Southern California chapter. General admission is $20. Reservations 
required: (213) 874-1625.

<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The California Arts Council has criticized arts organizations statewide for 
inadequate representation of ethnic minorities on their boards of directors. 
The issue is affecting arts groups to the extent that the council has cut back 
on the amount of grants to some organizations that otherwise have been highly 
praised, including South Coast Repertory.

ANN CONWAY: WHY WORRY? WE ALL GET SNUBBED SOMETIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Been snubbed lately? Been sniffed at like so much suet by someone you thought 
you knew? Been stashed at a Z table when you paid the same $300 per-person the 
folks at the A table paid? Been tossed a hello that was as warm as January? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the club. Snubbing, that nose-in-the air phenomenon synonymous with 
slighting and brushing off, is on the loose in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder, says Jerome Kirk, professor of sociology, anthropology and 
psychology at UC Irvine. "Orange County is modern. New. Twenty years ago you 
could stand on a hill at night beside UC Irvine and not see a light. Now, you 
stand on the same hill and how many cities do you see?" 
</P>
<P>
Our growth has programmed us to deal with strangers, Kirk says. "People who 
don't seem to come from anywhere. People who don't belong to any tradition." 
</P>
<P>
And strangers spell social insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually everyone in Orange County is a social impostor in the sense that 
just a few of us were born to the social position to which we aspire," Kirk 
says. "And we only have so much time to get ahead. So we spend it trying to 
maximize our own acquaintance with someone of higher stature." 
</P>
<P>
That puts higher-ups in the position of needing to snub those who want to crash 
their circles. And it puts the small fry in the position of needing to snub the 
smaller fry. "So just about everyone is getting snubbed," Kirk says. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Jane Riley remembers a friendlier time. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came here 25 years ago, everybody knew everybody," says Riley, wife of 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. "You didn't feel any social 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she says, she sees a tendency toward "grouping." "Certain folks are 
adopting attitudes toward people not in their group. Their values are totally 
material. They think status symbols are the most important thing. I was raised 
to think good manners was the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
The most blatant use of snubbing, says Riley, can be found on seating charts at 
local charity galas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've actually seen people change their table numbers because they think 
there's so much involved in seating at a party," she says. "They feel a bad 
seat is a snub. And sometimes they use a bad seat to snub," she adds. "The job 
of seating chairman is one I'll never take on. I've nearly seen murder!" 
</P>
<P>
A frosty "hello" is also a snub-on-the-move, says Gayle Anderson, president of 
the Orange County Protocol Foundation. "There's the hello-with-feeling that 
includes your name. Then there's the cool hello said in a monotone without your 
name. It means: 'I really don't want to be bothered.' " 
</P>
<P>
Looking beyond a person and avoiding eye contact are other popular ways to 
snub, says Susan Bartlett, daughter of Laguna Beach philanthropist Barbara 
Steele Williams. "I've seen a lot of that. People look toward you, then look 
way beyond you. They refuse to recognize the fact that you're there." 
</P>
<P>
Failing to recognize someone is the most basic snubbing technique, Kirk says. 
"If I recognize you, it also means I acknowledge that you exist. When you read 
etiquette books, you see all kinds of cautions about acknowledging someone who 
might take advantage of you." 
</P>
<P>
If a person has the potential to hurt you, he says, you're put in the position 
of actually recognizing but not recognizing, of knowing but not acknowledging 
that you know. 
</P>
<P>
What constitutes a social threat can be different things to different people, 
Kirk says. A poor person may threaten a wealthy person. A young person may 
threaten an older one. A social climber may threaten someone already at the top 
of the heap. 
</P>
<P>
Often, snubbers are people deathly afraid of being snubbed, says psychologist 
Linda Algazi of Corona del Mar. In effect, they're saying: "If I'm snubbing, I 
can't be snubbed." 
</P>
<P>
Algazi says she's never met a snubber who was "particularly valuable." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, snubbing isn't something you read about when you read the biographies 
of great men. You're more likely to read about someone who is nicer to busboys 
than they are to presidents of countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, if you're really superior, all of this snubbing business becomes 
nonsense. It's only when you have to hide behind make-believe criteria that any 
of it becomes relevant." 
</P>
<P>
Arden Flamson of Newport Beach thinks people often mistake shyness for 
snubbing. "Look at Nancy Reagan," says Flamson, wife of Richard Flamson, CEO of 
Security Pacific Corp. "She was criticized because she didn't go out of her way 
to meet people. People thought she was aloof. But we've been to a number of 
dinners with her and found her basically very shy. A woman in that position has 
everyone wanting to talk to her, to shake her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"All any of us can do is try and talk to as many people as possible. It's sort 
of human nature to go to people you know and talk with them at a party. That's 
why a lot of us prefer small parties, so we have an opportunity to visit 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
People who snub have a lot to learn, says Athalie Clarke, mother of heiress 
Joan Irvine Smith. "Why should anybody ever get to a point where they have to 
act like they're better than somebody else? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably because they haven't reached the true esteem they want for 
themselves," says Clarke. "And that esteem comes from evaluating life and 
realizing that you're here for one purpose: to do good for others."

A NIGHT AT THE RITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The video is already playing as the Ritz-Carlton bellman unlocks the hotel 
room. His white gloves point around the French Provincial furnishings and 
Italian marble bathroom as an actress on the television screen begins a tour of 
the Dana Point grounds. It is an odd introduction to one of America's best 
hotels -- and Orange County's most luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
It starts out typically enough. Classical music. Regal lion logo. Phrases like 
"The Golden Coast" and "California Riviera" and "Old World Charm." All this to 
describe a palatial cliff-top hotel with a panoramic ocean view, and decor that 
includes a $4-million "museum-quality" art collection -- not to mention a 
300-year-old castle fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
People sip afternoon tea here, we learn. They watch the sun set while a 
tuxedoed piano player performs "The Girl From Ipanema." They smoke after-dinner 
cigars in the Library and sip Civil War-era wine. You know, classy things that 
cost lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
Then come the commercials. Peddling gift shop merchandise such as a $100,000 
necklace and local stores with hand-painted frocks: "Do you ever get the 
impression that your designer dress is everyone else's designer dress?" 
</P>
<P>
And this novel appeal to the discount shopper: "Save enough on your jewelry 
purchases to pay for this vacation!" 
</P>
<P>
In case you hadn't noticed, Orange County's swankiest hotel is pretty swanky. 
</P>
<P>
So what is it like to stay a night at the resort adored by both hotelier queen 
Leona Helmsley and Robin Leach, television host of "Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous?" Will you run into Michael Jackson or Magic Johnson or Bob Dylan at the 
ice machine? Can you afford to stay another day or should you just buy that 
used economy car for the family instead? These and other questions may be 
answered later in this story. 
</P>
<P>
Although it calls itself the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, the hotel is actually 
in Dana Point -- thanks to last year's cityhood vote. 
</P>
<P>
A 45-minute drive from central Orange County, the Ritz-Carlton sits on 17 acres 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The Mediterranean-style compound hugs two miles 
of shoreline and, at Salt Creek Beach below the bluff, the water is dotted 
daily with 50 or 60 surfers riding some of the best waves around. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the sub-community known as Monarch Beach, the Ritz-Carlton is the shiny 
crown jewel in what developers envision as the Orange Riviera: million-dollar 
ocean-view homes and luxury hotels from Huntington Beach to Dana Point. But for 
now, there isn't a resort on the California coast that rivals the Ritz-Carlton 
in location, service, proximity to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
There are two pools, two spas, tennis courts, a golf course, a gym, organized 
volleyball, a beauty salon, complimentary day care that includes sandcastle 
building and lawn bowling. Eleven gardeners maintain the grounds, a routine 
that includes the weekly replacement of 4,000 flowering plants. And that's just 
the outside of the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
It is a young resort, 5 years old in August, but an upstart even among luxury 
hotels, according to national travel guide publishers. The Ritz-Carlton 
received five-star and five-diamond ratings, respectively, from Mobil Travel 
Guide and Triple-A Travel Guide -- among the most widely circulated guides in 
the country. The Ritz is the only resort in California to have received both 
top honors, and one of only 10 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the first time I drove up to see it years ago, and I thought, 'My 
God, it's the Riviera up on the cliffs!' " said Alice Wiesel, editor of the 
Illinois-based Mobil Travel Guide, a national consumer guide with an estimated 
1.5 million readers. 
</P>
<P>
"The service really sets it apart and, of course, the location on the ocean. 
There really isn't anything else like it on either coast of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Up the circular drive to the fountain with marble dolphins, the Ritz-Carlton 
entrance is low-key. A variety of uniformed employees park the car, load the 
luggage and escort you indoors. Check-in is at 3 p.m. There is no wait. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby is understated opulence. Marble floors inlaid with brilliant rugs. 
Leather chairs to die for. Dark wood furnishings, 19th-Century art. This is 
about the time the pinky finger involuntarily extends. 
</P>
<P>
The bellman, Rick, wearing a tan designer uniform and cap and white gloves, 
says "Good afternoon, ma'am (or sir)." Like all 850 employees of this hotel, he 
has been trained never to simply say "Hi!" or call guests "folks." It's either 
too presumptuous or too condescending. Pedestrian responses such as "OK" and 
"uh-huh" are shunned in favor of "certainly" and "my pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Nightly rates for the 393 rooms range from $185 to $2,000 for the Presidential 
Suite. Prices are based on vista. Unless you like parking lots or views that 
"may be obstructed by a tree," Ritz publicist Linda Adams says, the cheapest 
rooms have no view. For $260 your "courtyard" room affords a view of the garden 
and pool. Another $30 a night buys you the "coastline" room, with a partial 
view of the ocean. For $360 you get a panoramic view of the sea through the 
French doors opening on to your balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking even more exclusivity might opt for the fourth-floor Ritz-Carlton 
Club, popular with executives and celebrities. Depending on how much you eat 
and drink, this could be considered a bargain. It costs $45 to $85 extra, 
depending on your room, but you can eat and drink around the clock for no 
additional charge. 
</P>
<P>
In a cozy parlor with a veranda overlooking the waves, three concierges attend 
to the Club-level guests only, making dinner reservations and calling ahead for 
their cars. They keep stocked the open bar and the silver urns of coffee and 
hot water for English tea. Pastries and cereal and juices are spread across the 
antique chests in the morning; mixed fruits and cold cuts and sourdough bread 
and cheeses and scones arrive around noon; finger sandwiches go with afternoon 
tea; desserts are offered in the evening. And champagne is available all day 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel elevator only goes to the Club level with a fourth-floor room key, 
thereby keeping out the traffic -- and perhaps overzealous fans. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the elevator doors shut, Rick begins explaining hotel-like things. 
His guest looks bored and interrupts him. So is Bruce Springsteen staying on 
this floor? Rick grins and says he doesn't think so. He is polite enough not to 
roll his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the staff, he is engaging but speaks mostly when spoken to. He 
admits singer Janet Jackson and her sisters visited this floor the other week. 
As he unlocks the door, he does offer that Michael Jackson put a dance floor 
and sound system in this room to practice before concerts when he last toured. 
He stayed in the Presidential Suite two doors down. 
</P>
<P>
The room, like many, is decorated in "sea foam" blues and grays. The white 
antiqued wood and rattan furnishings are a cross between French Provincial and 
French Polynesian that works. The bathroom is marble, the white Ritz towels 
plush. There is a phone beside the commode with a redial button. There are 
complimentary toiletries but no sewing kit. Instead there is hotel seamstress 
Lolan Tsang for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it is at the beach, the Ritz-Carlton imposes a dress code. Oh, 
sure, it's discreetly announced post-arrival by way of a "guest attire" 
brochure on the nightstand. But though the management is rumored to be relaxing 
some on this, bellmen and waitresses have been known to point it out to guests. 
</P>
<P>
One guest reported that he was ever-so-politely refused service one morning by 
a waiter in the Cafe, the most casual restaurant. He was wearing green corduroy 
shorts and a golf shirt. "Does the gentleman have a jacket?" the waiter asked. 
The gentleman didn't. He also didn't want to wear one provided by the hotel, he 
said, even if it did match his shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Guidelines are offered for each public room. Denims are permitted, during the 
daytime and only in one restaurant. Guests are asked to wear Ritz-Carlton terry 
cloth robes en route to the pool. Children are not spared. Even outside 
contractors must wear collared shirts. But listen, tennis shoes are allowed. 
And if you forgot yours, you can rent a pair here! 
</P>
<P>
Ritz managers say they are somewhat torn about the dress code, but many of 
their guests, particularly Europeans, demand it. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," said an amused Philip Sellick, the hotel's landscape director 
and just about the most casually dressed employee in the place, "formal wear in 
California is putting socks on." 
</P>
<P>
After unpacking the luggage and watching that in-house video to find your 
bearings, it's time to check out the sunset. This, many guests will tell you, 
is the most alluring feature of the Ritz-Carlton. From your balcony or the 
beach, or from almost any ocean-facing hallway in the hotel, you can watch the 
sun drop beneath the horizon, and it is spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Some people fancy the hotel's daily afternoon tea, served from 2:30 to 5 in the 
Library. Here, the surroundings are almost museum-like: 19th-Century nautical 
paintings, an antique carved ship, overstuffed sofas, and shelves stocked with 
leather-bound books, like Caruthers' "History of a Lawsuit" and an 1883 edition 
of Chambers Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Lounge next door is like a long formal living room, with marble planters 
and striped cozy sofas. It's comfortable, has a terrific view and is still in 
range of the piano player performing "Nobody Does It Better." 
</P>
<P>
As the sun faded down the sky, a frosted blond woman from Texas is talking 
rather indiscreetly with a group of men about her ex-daughter-in-law, who has 
just departed for the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my ex-daughter-in-law. You know, she wants to get married. She really 
does. She goes to a lot of places but she meets the wrong men. She wants to be 
totally in love, totally happy. And you know, nothing's totally happy." 
</P>
<P>
She ordered another drink as "People Who Need People" played on the ivories, 
then picked up her train of thought. "She wants a house overlooking the ocean 
with waves crashing on the beach, but when do you ever have all your dreams 
come true? Except at this place, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
Hotelier Leona Helmsley, the embattled queen of New York's towering Helmsley 
Palace who is awaiting sentencing on a tax-evasion conviction, stayed in a 
Ritz-Carlton suite a few months ago, according to general manager Henry E. 
Schielein. Helmsley declined to return phone calls, but Schielein proudly notes 
that she deemed it smashing and "very peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
Other guests have included former U.S. Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald 
Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan; the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and Don 
Cornelius of "Soul Train" dance show fame, Ambassador and Mrs. Walter Annenberg 
and Malcolm Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Although hotels catering to the rich and reclusive can't keep high-profile 
guests without a low profile, some 235 people evidently permitted the 
Ritz-Carlton to reveal their past visits in a "Who's Who" list. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hotel managers are ever-so-gracious when they decline to discuss 
juicy details. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, one hears a stray rumor. 
</P>
<P>
A local builder awaiting completion of his custom home spent $180,000 in room 
rent alone for a nine-month stay at the Ritz-Carlton. Bellmen recall how his 
children skateboarded down the elegant driveway to school each day. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Dylan checked in as Mickey McGillicuddy. Michael Jackson rented the 
$2,000-a-night Presidential Suite and two adjoining rooms, then moved in a 
dance floor and sound equipment to warm up for his concert tour each day. 
Barbra Streisand, whose disguise left her looking like a Shiite Muslim, stayed 
a week before anyone knew she was there. Robin Leach, host of "Lifestyles of 
the Rich and Famous," bared his backside for charity at the Ritz in June before 
a crowd of entertainment types that included Robert Wagner and Frankie Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
About half of those who stay at the hotel are business travelers, and 15% of 
them are from foreign companies. The other half of the guest roster comes from 
Southern California -- vacationers from Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Bel-Air. 
They are often celebrating their birthdays or anniversaries or some other 
special occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Catering to the unusual desires of the rich is something for which the 
Ritz-Carlton is more famous. At the chain's Boston mother ship, Carol Channing 
had a kitchen installed in her suite and another woman had her entire room 
redecorated and repainted pink. In Dana Point, a couple with several children 
had a door put into a wall -- price tag $3,000 -- so the family could move 
freely between rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect that at a hotel like this," Schielein said. "People pay hundreds of 
dollars for wine, and they don't blink an eye. But they are coming to a place 
where they expect those things to be available." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation is interrupted when Schielein stops a busboy loading 
silverware onto a stainless steel tray. The exchange underscores his attention 
to detail, a quality that travel guide editor Wiesel points to as an essential 
key to the hotel's success. Wiesel claims to have spotted the general manager 
at 10 one night, straightening paintings in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Put a napkin on it and you won't make so much noise," Schielein instructed. 
The busboy did. "Good! Makes sense, eh? Thank you!" The busboy grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"So," Schielein continues, "how many restaurants can you go into where you can 
buy a bottle of wine that's over 100 years old?" He laughs with gusto. "After 
all, you can't take it with you!" 
</P>
<P>
The one thing the Ritz-Carlton has that no other chain seems to offer is a 
smoking den. It was Schielein's brainchild. 
</P>
<P>
Schielein -- who made his marriage proposal 25 years ago based on his right to 
smoke cigars without complaint -- introduced the smokers' lair at the original 
Ritz-Carlton in Boston, where he worked before coming to the chain's Dana Point 
resort in 1986. It occurred to him one day, as he lit up one of his beloved 
Partagas and a woman winced, that there was no place in the hotel he could 
comfortably puff away. Six months ago he opened the Dana Point hotel's Library 
to cigar and pipe smokers, and it has been written about in the New York Times, 
Playboy magazine and -- surprise -- tobacco giant Philip Morris Co.'s magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest Port served is $6 a glass, the most expensive $145. "This stuff is 
as old as my mother," one guest noted. 
</P>
<P>
Although tea is served in daytime hours, this room is very manly. Pasadena 
Weekly publisher Jim Laris captured it this way: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 . . . A beautiful cigartress, Angela, came over and offered us cigars from the 
Ritz-Carlton private stock, and we settled for two $9.80 Zino Veritas. (We 
would have felt guilty but the starving children in India don't smoke anyway.) 
And we lit those beauties with those long Macanudo matches that come in a rich 
black-and-gold triangle-shaped box. And we could hear "Ebb Tide" being played 
at the piano bar across the lobby and the lights sparkled and the ocean waves 
tumbled on the beach. And we settled back and talked about important things 
like truth and God and love and girls in tight-fitting jeans and whether or not 
Lite beer Tastes Great or is Less Filling. And we just smoked and talked and 
talked and smoked. And those cigars lasted about an hour and 45 minutes. Which 
we decided came damn close to how long we were happily married. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Finally it was time to leave the Library. And we walked out and got on the 
elevator and a rather elderly lady with light blue hair and terminal rouge 
said, "PeeYew. My first husband died from cancer of the whole body because he 
smoked what you guys smell like." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ron turned to me and said, "You know, it doesn't get any better than 
this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner time rolls around and, it is to be hoped, you took advantage of the 
unlimited-drinks-for-$65-a-night Club deal upstairs. Because supper in the 
Dining Room is going to cost you. This is little food on big plates. Five 
half-dollar-size lamb noisettes and potatoes the shape of rabbit's feet. 
</P>
<P>
It's tasty and the service is china. The walls are the color of salmon, the 
lighting soft and low and flattering to the skin. Two servers are assigned to 
each table. The "back-waiter" never speaks. Drinking water is bottled Vittel. 
The lobster bisque, well, they do this thing where the bowl arrives to your 
table with two little bites in it, artfully arranged. Then they ladle the stuff 
in. It's all very decadent and yummy, and one might even pick up tips from a 
waiter on how to sneak into the pool without checking in. Next trip. 
</P>
<P>
All raves about the Ritz-Carlton invariably hark back to the gracious employees 
-- "ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen," as the corporate motto 
goes. There are two employees for every hotel room -- or an average of one per 
guest. That's more than twice the national average, and it shows. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the hotel's 850 workers happy is fundamental, and it goes beyond wages, 
said Owen E. Dorsey, vice president of human resources for the Georgia-based 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. Employees have to feel good about themselves, have 
self-esteem, he said. Part of that comes in the cachet of working for one of 
the country's best resorts. Part of it comes from the yearly awards bash held 
two weeks ago that was likened by some workers to the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Here, at the dinner-dance held in the hotel's most sumptuous ballroom, 
dishwashers and maids arrive in tuxedos and chiffon and boogie with management, 
puffing away on cigars beside the big boss himself. After a full-course lobster 
and filet mignon dinner, five awards to the five-star employees of the year are 
announced: round-trip, weeklong trips for two to any Ritz-Carlton in America, 
plus $500 in spending money. The banquet is a wild, employees-only party for 
500 people. Those employees who had to work it get their own banquet later. 
</P>
<P>
And you wonder why the two guys the next morning, dressed in white golf shirts, 
backs bent over to pick up leaves along the hotel driveway, raise upright to 
wave goodby. They amble nearer the departing car, their trash bags in tow. 
"Have a safe trip!"

<P>
Description: Both birds are sleek, graceful waders with long, slender bills and 
spindly legs. Their colorations are similar. The American avocet is black and 
white above and white below; head and neck rusty in breeding plumage and gray 
in winter; male bills are longer and more straight. Adults average about 18 
inches in length. The male stilt's glossy black back and bill contrast sharply 
with white underparts and long red or pink legs; females are browner. The adult 
stilt is somewhat smaller than the avocet, averaging 14 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Usually marshes, mud flats, ponds and flooded fields. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly crustaceans, insects and some seeds for both. 
</P>
<P>
Display: Avocet male wades, bows, crouches, dances with wings spread; prostrate 
female extends head, neck and wings. The stilt male alternately pecks 
ground/water and preens breast, then circles female flicking water with bill; 
female elongates. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Locations vary, but both will build in sand, mud flats below brush; may 
be open or partly concealed and often on water-bounded mound above tide line. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: The avocet's eggs are olive-buff, marked with brown and black; the 
stilt's buff, marked with dark brown and black coloring and often are 
nest-stained. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Avocet -- Loud calls and mobbing of predator typical 
defense on breeding grounds; group distraction display. Male incubates more 
frequently for first eight days, then primarily female for next 16. Young hatch 
synchronously; activity peaks in early morning and in afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Stilt -- In hot environments, "belly-soaking" (transport of water in the 
ventral feathers) by incubating adults cools the eggs or chicks by increasing 
nest humidity. Adults might make 100 trips for water in one day. Adults 
distract predators using aerial, mock incubation, and feigned injury displays. 
Young hide when threatened, swim using wings. 
</P>

<P>
A motorcyclist veered off the Garden Grove Freeway and crashed into a thicket 
early today, killing him and injuring his passenger, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers used chain saws to reach the 19-year-old motorcyclist, who lived in 
Cypress, and his passenger, Debra Kay Andrews, 25, of Lakewood, officers said. 
Neither was wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclist was heading westbound on the freeway at 1:10 a.m. at what witnesses 
said was an excessive rate of speed. CHP Sgt. Don Hulen said when the 
motorcyclist reached a curve just east of Newland Street he veered off the 
freeway and both aboard the motorcycle were hurled down an embankment into some 
shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, 
was pronounced dead at the scene. Andrews suffered cuts and scrapes and was 
listed in fair condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange.

A man suspected of robbing an Agoura Hills savings and loan is being held 
without bail today after he was arrested at the end of a car and foot chase by 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Brady, 24, of Topanga was being held on suspicion of armed robbery at the 
sheriff's Malibu Station Jail, Deputy Hal Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady is accused of holding up a Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan about 2:30 
p.m. Thursday in the 5800 block of Kanan Road, Grant said. The suspect pointed 
a gun at a teller and escaped with $2,053, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the robbery, deputies spotted a yellow Volkswagen that matched 
the description of the robber's car. The car was followed on the Ventura 
Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies attempted to pull the vehicle over, it sped up and was pursued. 
Grant said Brady drove to his home in the 20800 block of Observation Drive, 
then ran into a rugged, hilly area behind the house. Deputies chased him and he 
was arrested without incident. Grant said money and a pellet gun were found in 
the Volkswagen.

The source said Syrian troops passed the unnamed woman into the custody of 
former President Suleiman Franjieh on Thursday after she was seized by 
unidentified gunmen Sunday.

The source said her kidnaping had been a personal matter. He said pressure from 
the Swiss government had secured her release, and she had been asked to leave 
Lebanon and not return. At the request of her family her name was not released.

John Paul II today attacked birth control in Indonesia, a Third World pioneer 
in restricting population growth. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the last day of his five-day visit to predominantly Muslim 
Indonesia, he told Catholic bishops: "You are sometimes painfully aware that 
certain traditional practices and other contemporary social influences bring 
about an obscuring of fundamental principles regarding family life and the 
responsible transmission of life." Vatican officials confirmed that this was a 
reference to birth control as well as polygamy and the subordinate position of 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive promotion of birth control has been official policy since 1970 in 
Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous country. President Suharto this year 
received the first U.N. award for population growth control.

Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, the country's first woman prime 
minister, resigned today as head of a minority Labor government, clearing the 
way for a center-right coalition to take power. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland, 50, handed her government's resignation to King Olav at his castle 
in central Oslo. The king asked Conservative leader Jan Syse to form a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Brundtland forged a reputation as an environmental champion and fighter for 
women's rights during three difficult years of government. Although economists 
have credited her for much of the recent economic recovery, the price has been 
record jobless levels of about 4%, in a country where full employment has been 
an almost holy tradition. Norway's voters clearly thought the price too high.

A court today found 253 Red Brigade terrorists and other left-wing extremists 
innocent of charges of waging an armed insurrection against the state. 
</P>
<P>
The acquittals had been expected because of three previous rulings dating back 
to 1970 when Italian courts refused to accept the legal concept that domestic 
terrorism amounts to a political attack or the waging of war against the state.

Police charged a law school graduate with torturing and killing 77 cats he 
obtained through free-kitten newspaper advertisements, and authorities said 
today that if convicted he could get up to 77 years in prison. 
</P>

Mitchell Munoz, 34, of De Kalb County was arrested Thursday after police were 
tipped by an employee of a photo-processing plant who saw pictures of the 
suspect executing the animals in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Before making the arrest, officers said they discovered photographs of dead 
kittens, three severed cat tails under a bathroom sink and diaries documenting 
when the cats were acquired, how they behaved and what was done to them. A 
nylon rope hanging from the bathroom shower rod -- used to hang kittens -- also 
was found, officers said.

SYRIAN DEFECTOR TELLS OF FLYING THROUGH ISRAELI AIR DEFENSES

<P>
A Syrian air force defector told today how he skimmed through Israeli air 
defenses at just below the speed of sound, searching for a place to land before 
he could be shot down. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I might be intercepted by Israeli forces," MIG-23 pilot Mohammed 
Bassem Adel, 33, told a news conference arranged by the Israeli army at a 
military base near Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said Israel's air defenses failed to detect 
the Soviet-made fighter when it flew through the border Wednesday, and an 
investigation into the apparent lapse has begun. 
</P>
<P>
Bassem Adel, slim, erect and unsmiling, said he planned his defection several 
months in advance and had had no prior contact with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I crossed the Israeli border at (about 700 m.p.h.), flying no higher than 150 
feet and sometimes as low as 90 feet, depending on terrain," he said through an 
Israeli interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult mission, particularly because that part of the border 
is full of missiles," the Syrian pilot said. 
</P>
<P>
At that speed and altitude, he could not waggle his plane's wings nor lower the 
landing gear to show that he had no hostile intent. Instead, he turned off its 
electronic systems. 
</P>
<P>
"My priority was to land as quickly as possible . . . so I could get out and 
tell someone I wanted to defect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that as a single aircraft, I did not pose a threat to a country that 
has confidence in itself." 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know where he was going in Israel and would have tried to 
land on a road had he not spotted the small civilian airstrip near Megiddo 
where he came down about four minutes after crossing the border.

<P>
Kitty Dukakis, describing herself as an alcoholic and drug addict, today urged 
doctors at a World Congress of Psychiatry to avoid prescribing drugs that may 
cause addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you psychiatrists not to give in to our society's urge for a quick fix, 
not to rush to identify drugs as the first solution to your patient's problem," 
Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors' prescriptions often complicate an alcohol and drug abuse problem, 
which addicts carefully hide from their doctors, she told the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis said her long addiction to amphetamines relapsed to alcoholism after 
her husband lost the presidential elections in 1988. "I am an alcoholic and a 
drug addict," Dukakis said. 
</P>
<P>
She said diet pills she took as a teen-ager to look slim became a 27-year 
amphetamine addiction, which she hid from everyone including her husband.

The government today lifted restrictions on the political activity of

Law and Order Ministry spokesman Lt. Peet Bothma said restrictions on Mrs. 
Sisulu, 71, imposed Feb. 24, 1988, were lifted at 7:40 a.m. today, allowing her 
to resume her political activity and lifting a virtual dusk-to-dawn house 
arrest order. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sisulu called the order "wonderful" and said a police officer informed her 
that her husband will be released over the weekend. President Frederik W. de 
Klerk Tuesday ordered the unconditional release of eight of the country's most 
prominent security prisoners, including Sisulu.

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills today urged Japan to come up 
with a plan for reforming its business practices by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, visiting Tokyo to press for action on a wide range of trade issues, 
criticized behavior by Japanese companies that she said obstructs foreign goods 
and investment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong feeling of inequity where the American market is open and 
counterpart markets overseas are closed," she told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors can come and buy a store, a farm, a business or stock in America, 
but Americans, when they come overseas, may not buy easily without restrictions 
the same store, farm, stock or business." 
</P>
<P>
Hills attacked business practices such as Japanese firms' alleged tendency to 
buy almost exclusively from other domestic firms, discrimination against 
foreign investors, and "patent flooding," or taking out so many patents related 
to a foreign innovation that the inventor cannot sell his product in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said the United States and Japan should develop plans for removing 
obstacles to trade and take initial steps to implement some reforms by next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants Japan to help reduce its huge bilateral trade surplus by 
reforming its economic structure to promote domestic consumption and absorb 
more foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
Japan says the United States should correct its own economic weaknesses, 
including its low savings rate and relatively short-sighted corporate 
management.

Oil prices rose sharply today as the United States and Europe laid in winter 
fuel in what has lately begun to look like a tighter world petroleum market. 
</P>
<P>
The worldwide average spot crude oil price is now $18 a barrel, according to an 
index compiled daily by Britain's National Westminster Bank. That is a dollar 
up on the average for September and $2 above August. It is fully $4 up on the 
average for the whole of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said demand has rebounded by nearly 9% since a glut took hold 
in 1983, helped along by weaker prices during the glut and by booming economies 
-- especially in Asia.

AMR Corp. remained silent today on a $7-billion proposed buyout by New York 
developer Donald Trump amid reports the parent of American Airlines is seeking 
help from unions and billionaire Robert M. Bass. 
</P>
<P>
In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR was up $3.625 a 
share to $102.375, still well below the $120 per share offered by Trump, but it 
was the second straight day of an increase. On Thursday, AMR rose $1.625 to 
close at $98.75 as 1.6 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts have said the stock will continue to trade far below the 
level of Trump's offer until there is a significant move by either side. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall met with 
American's pilots union about a possible employee-management buyout designed to 
fend off Trump's offer. The buyout would include significant participation by 
the pilots union and the unions representing machinists and flight attendants 
at American, the paper said.

At least 6,500 miners at all five diamond mines of De Beers Consolidated Mines 
Ltd. struck today for higher wages in the first national strike in the 
company's history, company and union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By this afternoon, almost 100% of workers on two shifts had joined the 
stoppage, but total support for the strike will not be clear until a full work 
cycle has been completed, De Beers spokesman Sejamothopo Motau said. 
</P>
<P>
The total black labor force in the five mines and one geology department was 
about 9,000, Motau said. The white mining work force was unaffected by the 
strike, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mines are highly mechanized and it was not clear to what extent 
production was affected, Motau said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers has offered a wage increase of 17%, which would raise the minimum 
monthly wage from 553 rand ($205) to 647 rand ($240) and keep pace with 
inflation. The NUM is demanding a 37.6% increase to 761 rand ($282) a month.

The Cincinnati Reds today announced the signing of Bob Quinn, a former New York 
Yankees executive, to a two-year contract as the Reds' vice president and 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, 52, replaces Murray Cook, who had served two seasons as the Reds' vice 
president and general manager. Quinn, who has a 30-year background in baseball 
administration, comes to Cincinnati after three seasons with the Yankees, 
including the last two seasons as vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Reds owner Marge Schott refused to say whether Cook resigned or was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn's first objective for Schott is to find a new manager. Quinn said at a 
news conference today that interim manager Tommy Helms, who took over Aug. 24 
after Pete Rose was banned over allegations of baseball gambling, remains a 
candidate for the 1990 job. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn declined to identify other managerial candidates.

LAKERS MIFFED, WAIVE DAILEY

The Lakers, refusing to put up with Quintin Dailey's "unconscionable" behavior, 
waived the veteran guard today, one day after he apparently overslept and 
missed practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers signed the former University of San Francisco star as a free agent 
on Sept. 12 but were displeased with his performance and work habits in 
training camp. Dailey was cut even though his contract, reportedly worth 
$400,000, is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team is undergoing a major transitional period at this time, and we feel 
it has become apparent that Quintin is not fitting in," General Manager Jerry 
West said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making this move at this time to give him a better opportunity with 
another team, and we wish him continued success on and off the basketball 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Dailey, 28, began camp by missing the Lakers' flight to Honolulu, then did not 
show for a team meeting. He left the opening practice early and failed to 
appear for a 9 a.m. practice Thursday.

Joe Foy, who played third base for the 1967 American League champion Boston Red 
Sox, died of a heart attack Thursday. He was 46 and died at his home in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Foy played for the Red Sox from 1966 through 1968, then was claimed by the 
Kansas City Royals in the expansion draft. He played one year for the Royals 
before being traded to the New York Mets. He ended his major league career in 
1971 with the Washington Senators. 
</P>
<P>
Foy was known more for his defensive ability than his offensive skills. He led 
American League third basemen in double plays in 1966 with 28, and again in 
1968 with 36.
