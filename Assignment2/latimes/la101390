VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli police have mercilessly killed 19 young and old Palestinians near the 
Al Aqsa Mosque of Jerusalem. It was a show of brutality and barbarism by the 
Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
The world order has been changed; all nations, including the Soviet Union and 
China, are talking world peace and cooperating with the Western world in the 
United Nations Security Council. These world leaders have passed five strong 
resolutions against Saddam Hussein without much trouble. They should stand up 
now against the fascist regime of Yitzhak Shamir and force him to vacate the 
occupied lands of Palestinian people or face a blockade and isolation similar 
to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War is over, the strategic value of Israel is almost zero, and 
the United States cannot afford to keep a friendship with such a fascist regime 
at the cost of our interests in a peaceful world.

HAHN AND BLACK COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Bill Boyarsky's column "Hahn Salute Foreshadows End of Era" 
(Metro, Sept. 21): 
</P>
<P>
The first portion of this article was very complimentary to Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn and deservedly so. 
</P>
<P>
Boyarsky reported the comments of Drs. Joseph Griffin and E.V. Hill, in which 
they stated that Supervisor Hahn, although a white man representing the 2nd 
District which is predominantly black, "that the matter of color has never been 
brought up." If the question is asked of any voter in the 2nd District, 
regardless of color, about Supervisor Hahn's public service commitment, the 
answer would be the same. "Supervisor Hahn is the greatest public servant we 
know. He cares about people." He serves all fairly and equally and that's 
understood! 
</P>
<P>
Boyarsky did an outstanding job in reporting about Hahn and how the people feel 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
But the column went downhill when Boyarsky addressed the issue of confrontation 
between blacks and other minority groups and the delivery of health care at 
Martin Luther King Hospital. He wrote "black political power is waning in Los 
Angeles. The tide of demography is running against blacks. . . . They are being 
replaced by Latinos and Asians." 
</P>
<P>
Boyarsky states, "There is potential for divisiveness, and perhaps the most 
delicate issue is health care. The poor from all three groups suffer from a 
shortage of public health care, and black leaders fear their community's poor 
may be thrust into a losing competition for hospital and clinic care with 
impoverished Latinos and Asians." These statements are inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
Demography is changing all over the county, the state and the nation. More 
Third World people are moving in and the numbers are growing. The community 
that has the most to fear is the community that has the most to lose, and that 
is not the black community. The black community is committed to working with 
Asians and Latinos. I believe there is no hostility among people who want to 
work together -- and they will. They should just be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
As to Martin Luther King Hospital, Hahn is correct when he blamed the shortage 
of funds for the hospital's problems. I worked as his deputy for 12 years and I 
have firsthand knowledge that monies that were needed for appropriate services 
and equipment were never provided. However, the hospital administration, 
doctors and nurses working with the bare minimum always did the best job under 
adverse circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
King Hospital is not the only hospital in the county system that's been on 
conditional accreditation. For example, County-USC Medical Center is currently 
on the status of conditional accreditation; the High Desert Hospital, formerly 
Mira Loma, lost its accreditation. Simply put, mostly poor people are required 
to go to county hospitals, but the "downtown Hall of Administration" doesn't 
always provide sufficient funding for staffing and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses have to work hard enough. They should not be blamed for the 
shortsightedness of bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Writing Hahn off for reelection is a mistake. That decision still remains with 
Hahn and the people of the 2nd District. I know Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) is a good person; he is my congressman. However, the reporter went a 
little too far in selecting by inference Hahn's successor. That right shall 
always remain with the people.

VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I read your report (Part A, Oct. 8) on the Bush Administration's go-ahead 
for a $400-million loan to construct housing for Soviet Jews in Israel, I 
looked up at the TV screen and watched Israeli troops gunning down fleeing 
Palestinian youths and barring ambulance crews from picking up wounded 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it the Israelis can shoot into civilian crowds, beat old people, 
children, women, imprison men without due cause, blow up the homes of relatives 
of suspected Palestinians -- in other words, trample on every right we hold 
dear -- and our Congress continues to reward them with more aid? It is time 
this aid be stopped.

CUTTING U.S. AID TO EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement of conditions in El Salvador, as presented by President Alfredo 
Cristiani ("Cut Aid, and See Democracy Abort," Commentary, Oct. 1), is based on 
unsupported assertions that are misleading and false. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani declares that "During the past 10 years, El Salvador has accomplished 
what took Western democracies a century to achieve." Some of these 
"accomplishments," as noted in a report from the U.S. State Department: The 
infant mortality rate, a barometer for the general health of the population, 
which was 53 per 1,000 at the end of the '70s, rose to 71 per 1,000 by 1987. 
While urban centers show a literacy rate of 62%, the figure for rural areas is 
40% or below. The gross domestic product, an indicator of a country's economic 
activity, dropped more than 30% between 1978 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International's annual report documents a large number of arrests of 
government opponents in 1990. INS statistics indicate that the number of 
Salvadoran refugees entering the U.S. has increased significantly in the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani says that it is unfair to criticize his government for the slow pace 
of the investigation of the Jesuit murders, but speed alone is not the issue. 
The American public is more disturbed by reports of evidence destroyed while in 
police custody, of witnesses harassed and intimidated by government agents, of 
potential witnesses shielded by the military and of collusion among army 
officers. Circumstances indicate that the order to kill the Jesuits might have 
been issued at the highest level of military command, perhaps even by an 
official of the civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cristiani, an office has been instituted to monitor and 
investigate alleged human rights violations -- rather like putting the fox in 
charge of the chicken coop. There is evidence that the infamous death squads 
operate with permission of the military high command. More important, the 
report compiled by the Special Task Force on El Salvador, chaired by Rep. Joe 
Moakley (D-Mass), found that the Jesuit murders was only one incident in a 
pattern of systematic disregard for human rights. The conclusion must be that 
today, under Cristiani's administration, El Salvador does not function as a 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would cut military aid 
to El Salvador by 50% in 1991, making payment contingent on peace negotiations 
with the rebel coalition and an aggressive investigation of the Jesuit murders. 
The companion legislation in the Senate, the Dodd-Leahy bill, is expected to 
come to the floor for vote before adjournment. It should be passed. It would 
serve notice that the U.S. refuses to support the Salvadoran government without 
question indefinitely.

FARMERS MARKET: A VENERABLE INSTITUTION NEEDS AN EXPANDED ECONOMIC BASE, LEST 
IT GO THE WAY OF OTHER WELL-KNOWN LANDMARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY L. HILTY JR., Henry L. Hilty Jr. is president of the A.F. Gilmore Co., 
which owns Farmers Market. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this increasingly diverse city, where opinions differ on everything from 
malathion spraying to whether Robert Guillaume or Michael Crawford is the 
better "Phantom," one thing seems remarkably free from controversy: No one 
wants to lose Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
The market is a wondrous world of hustle and bustle, of freshly made fudge and 
the first kiwi fruit you ever saw, of tourists in saris and turbans and 
irresistible puppies tumbling over each other in the pet store window. 
</P>
<P>
The market is a reflection of times past, when Los Angeles seemed simpler, 
girls wore poodle skirts and penny loafers and you could take the Red Cars to 
Pasadena or the beach. The market is Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, 
"Father Knows Best" and "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
The market is Los Angeles as we like to remember it -- and Angelenos are 
determined that nothing will destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
No one is more determined to preserve the market than I am. My 
great-grandfather, Arthur Fremont Gilmore, pioneered the 3rd-and-Fairfax area 
in the 1870s, and my grandfather, Earl Gilmore, opened the market in 1934. My 
happiest childhood days were spent at the market, running up and down the 
aisles with the boys and girls whose parents owned the food stalls. Like me, 
many of them followed in their parents' footsteps. The market has many second- 
and even third-generation businesses. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the question was never whether to preserve the market -- but how. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the '30s, '40s, '50s and '60s, the market was unique. Where else 
could you find peaches out of season or ripe, red apples almost as big as 
cantaloupes? But improved farming techniques and refrigerated trucks and air 
freight changed all that. In recent years, "farmers" and "ranch" markets have 
sprung up throughout the Southland, often linked to major retail malls. They 
have been joined by multiplex theaters and food courts offering a range of fast 
foods and ethnic menus. In short, today's mall is an entertainment mecca, the 
gathering place of the '80s and '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Farmers Market remains special. Local shoppers and tourists are 
still drawn by the wonderful array of specialty food items and by the 
spectacular quality of the produce, meats and seafood. 
</P>
<P>
But in today's competitive climate that's not enough. And I worry about that. 
</P>
<P>
The market may be a neighbor of the La Brea Tar Pits, but I don't want it to go 
the way of the dinosaurs. Everyone mourns the loss of Los Angeles' unique 
landmarks: the Brown Derby, Punch and Judy ice-cream parlors, the Ambassador 
Hotel and the glamorous Mocambo and Ciro's. And you frequently hear the 
complaint, "Why didn't someone save them?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is surprisingly simple. We may treasure the memories, but without an 
adequate economic base, these landmarks simply couldn't be saved. 
</P>
<P>
That's what the project we've proposed will provide for the Farmers Market -- 
an economic base to ensure its future. Surrounding the market with acres of 
surface parking may be a quaint reminder of the '50s, but it doesn't work in 
the economic reality of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Market project will provide many benefits to the community: 
shopping, entertainment and dining options, jobs, local revenues and new 
housing. But the project's primary focus has always been on preserving the 
market. Extraordinary pains have been taken to ensure its historic integrity 
and to protect it during construction. 
</P>
<P>
* The project planner was selected because of his firm's track record in 
combining new construction with historic restoration. 
</P>
<P>
* The construction schedule was carefully designed so that market operations 
can continue uninterrupted, even though it will result in significant 
additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
* About $22 million will be spent on specially located parking for the market 
and on new kitchens, loading docks and warehouses to replace outdated 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers Market has endured for more than 55 years; many consider it a Southland 
institution. But even institutions fail without sufficient drawing power. The 
proposed development at the market will provide that drawing power and protect 
a venerable landmark, ensuring for future generations an increasingly rare 
experience -- a glimpse of Los Angeles as it was more than half a century ago.

Look out, Times, your bias is showing again! In "Verdict Is Guilty in 2 Live 
Crew's Rap Album Sale" (Oct. 4) we read that an "all-white" jury convicted 
Charles Freeman of selling obscenity in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Are you trying to make this anti-obscenity issue into one of race? Simply 
stated, a jury convicted Freeman based on the facts: The lyrics of the songs 
from 2 Live Crew are obscene. Under the guise of "freedom of expression," 2 
Live Crew is hiding words that degrade and violate women and children. The 
music is not the problem, but the words definitely "appeal to a morbid interest 
in sex." I congratulate the jury.

MORNING BRIEFING: WITH FRIENDS LIKE THIS, WHO NEEDS HUMILITY?

<P>
Brigham Young quarterback Ty Detmer says the Cougars' loss to Oregon two weeks 
ago brought him down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he needs help staying humble. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer told Robert Mims of the Associated Press: "Our team is pretty close, and 
there are two or three people who will keep you in line." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer described the aftermath of a recent blind date: "We went to one of those 
photograph booths . . . and one of my roommates got hold of (the pictures) and 
printed up some wedding invitations and circulated them around. It was kind of 
rough." 
</P>

Trivia time: Name the six National Hockey League players who do not wear a 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
America's coach: At the beginning of the NFL season, Coach Bill Parcells of the 
New York Giants replaced cornerback Perry Williams, a six-year starter, with 
Mark Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Williams complained to the media but returned to the starting lineup after 
Collins was injured. In a recent victory over the Miami Dolphins, Williams had 
an interception, forced a fumble and made several tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the benching motivated Williams, Parcells yelled at reporters: 
"You guys! You guys are all like Communists. You're insidious. You want to stir 
up trouble." 
</P>
<P>
America's prep coach: In August, when actress Julia Roberts was in Abbeville, 
S.C., to film "Sleeping With the Enemy," she called the town "horribly racist" 
after a black friend was refused service at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Botts, Abbeville High football coach whose team is 7-0 this season after 
going winless in 11 games last year, said Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reward to everybody, and especially to our community. Our community 
kind of got slapped in the face with that Julia Roberts thing. Maybe in some 
little way the success we're having is bringing some pride back to the people 
here. It's something that they can get behind." 
</P>
<P>
Having problems in your community? Just win seven high school football games in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
Prep coaches, con't.: More news from South Carolina: In Chesterfield County 
this week, verbal salvos filled the air after McBee High's 75-14 victory over 
Bethune last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A case of running up the score? Darn right, McBee Coach David Green said 
Wednesday. He wasn't going to stand around and let the Bethune players hurl 
obscenities and ice at his kids. 
</P>
<P>
But Bethune Coach Randy Lowery said: "I feel like he was using those two things 
to try to justify running the score on us."

<P>
A true champion is a person or team that wins with class, dignity, integrity 
and humility. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these qualities are altogether lacking in the chemistry of the 
Oakland Athletics. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Dennis Eckersley's 
finger-pointing and fist-waving, Rickey Henderson's selfish quest for the 
batting title, Jose Canseco's public comeuppances, and especially Dave 
Stewart's verbal trashings of opposing players and teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics can lay claim to having won the most games of any team in the 
past three years, to defeating opponents in the past three championship series 
and to winning last year's World Series. But true champions? 
</P>
<P>
Try the 1988 Dodgers.

Quite often in my dental chair I will meet someone who calls himself a true 
longtime Angeleno. I tell them that they must first pass a test of 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
I ask them, "Who was Steve Bilko?" They often say, "Gee, I haven't thought of 
him for 30 years. What happened to him?" 
</P>
<P>
Big Steve Bilko was a demigod to us early boomers growing up in the '50s. He 
was our Sultan of Swat. Whenever he took the plate for the old Pacific Coast 
League Angels, we could feel the rush of air from his swing. Anything was 
possible when Bilko was up, and even when the Angels were far behind, no one 
would get his beer until Bilko had his turn at bat. 
</P>
<P>
My certification is showing a 95% pass rate. Can you help my patients and 
myself by letting us know what happened to this man who deserves to be batting 
cleanup in Los Angeles' "Field of Dreams"?

DODGERS SHOULD KEEP VALENZUELA, DANIELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are dealt three aces in poker, do you toss one away in search of a 
second pair? 
</P>
<P>
If, as the rumor mill and the press suggest, a relatively unhealthy Kal Daniels 
causes the Dodgers to drool over the prospect of trading him for some mythical 
perfect third baseman, then the sight of Daniels a year and a half removed from 
knee surgery, happy and ready for 1991, should make the Dodgers realize that 
trading him would be an epic mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hope the New York Mets will let Darryl Strawberry go, and that the 
Dodgers, buoyed by visions of Daniels, Strawberry and Eddie Murray anchoring 
the lineup, will hold onto their aces and go for tangible greatness instead of 
theoretical mediocrity.

HATE COVERAGE, MASCOT, BUT LOVE BOB MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The consistent superstar for the Kings over the years has been play-by-play man 
Bob Miller. He is the equal of Vin Scully in baseball and Chick Hearn in 
basketball, but now radio listeners are deprived of his voice. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Kings finally have a single radio station that can be heard 
throughout Southern California, they need to return their greatest asset to the 
listeners.

Once again the Clippers have demonstrated that nothing has changed and that 
they will remain a second-class organization into the 1990s.

<P>
The Clippers land Bo Kimble, a bona fide player and a marketing dream, then 
allow their attorney to belittle him in public. Very intelligent.

DODGERS SHOULD KEEP VALENZUELA, DANIELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1982 when I was 17 and a senior at Garfield High, Fernando Valenzuela came 
out to speak to us. He was a big star then. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't have to come out to see us, but he did. 
</P>
<P>
He told us -- both in Spanish and through an English interpreter -- to stay in 
school. He said any of us could have something he didn't have a chance to have 
-- an education. 
</P>
<P>
I never forgot Fernando's message. I went to school -- Cal State L.A. and then 
got a master's degree from UCLA -- and live a good life with my wife and 
2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
I feel as if the tables have been turned. Now my career is going well and 
Fernando needs someone to believe in him. I sincerely hope the Dodgers bring 
Fernando back. I want my Miguelito to see this man.

Arizona defined his mission and his campus more clearly than all the publicity

Schembechler, Barry Switzer, Jerry Tarkanian and Charles Young.

Senior quarterback Greg Windle passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more 
to lead Troy High School to a 28-7 victory over Sonora in the Freeway League 
opener for both teams Friday night at Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Windle started the scoring with a 37-yard pass to Chad Hartford with 4:50 left 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He then scored on a one-yard run on the second quarter. The touchdown was set 
up by a fumble recovery by Kory Silvestri at the Sonora 43. 
</P>
<P>
He also completed a 30-yard scoring pass to Steve Friedrich with 5:53 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford's extra point gave Troy (3-3, 1-0) a 21-0 lead that it took into 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Windle capped the scoring with another one-yard run on the first play of the 
final quarter. He completed 15 of 17 passes for 243 yards with no 
interceptions. Friedrich had six catches for 111 yards, and has 31 catches for 
435 yards in six games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Fletcher scored Sonora's only touchdown with 4:21 left in the 
third quarter on a one-yard run that completed a 61-yard, 15-play drive. All 61 
yards came on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Deron Drake, a junior running back, ran for 124 yards in 26 carries for Sonora 
(1-5, 0-1), which had only 180 yards in total offense. DALE RUHE

Sunny Hills, turning two interceptions and a fumble recovery into touchdowns, 
defeated Buena Park, 33-0, Friday in the teams' Freeway League opener. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (2-4) fell behind, 7-0, with 4:38 left in the first quarter when 
Sunny Hills' Joey Montgomery intercepted a pass by quarterback Mark Medellin 
and returned it 45 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers' second touchdown by interception was a 69-yard return by lineman 
Jeff Hicks with 1:10 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A third touchdown by Sunny Hills' defense came with 4:22 remaining in the game 
after a Coyotes' flea-flicker play failed. Buena Park reserve quarterback Geno 
Robles completed a five-yard pass to Juan Guerra, but Guerra's lateral was 
grabbed by Brent Howes, who ran 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills' other two touchdowns were scored by the offense. Quarterback 
Hakeim McKenzie scored on a six-yard keeper with 7:23 remaining in the third 
quarter and Mike Sullivan scored three minutes later on a 45-yard run. 
</P>

Sullivan rushed for 93 yards in nine carries for Sunny Hills (3-3). DENNIS

GOAL-LINE STAND SAVES FULLERTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton High School, saved by a fourth-quarter goal-line stand, defeated La 
Habra Friday night, 15-12, in a Freeway League game at La Habra High. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 15-12, with 9 minutes 3 seconds remaining in the game, Fullerton 
linebacker D.C. Olsen sliced through the La Habra offensive line and tackled 
Jason Johnson a yard short of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra had a first and goal at the four-yard line, but gained only three 
yards on four plays. 
</P>
<P>
It was crucial defensive series, because it allowed Fullerton (5-1 overall, 1-0 
in league play) to hang on and defeat the Highlanders (4-2, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton defense established itself early by causing Johnson to fumble on 
each of La Habra's first two series of the game, but the Indians' big defensive 
plays came in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, a 6-foot 1-inch, 220-pound linebacker, had 11 solo tackles and six 
assisted tackles. And two other key plays by Olsen, who also plays fullback, 
were critical to Fullerton's victory. 
</P>
<P>
He scored the go-ahead touchdown for the Indians in the third quarter on a 
one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in the fourth quarter, Olsen took a pitch in the Fullerton end zone and 
punted 40 yards on third down, giving the Indians some breathing room and 
setting up another defensive stand. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Johnson gained eight yards on first down but was stopped on two 
successive running plays, the second one after gaining one yard on 
fourth-and-two. Fullerton then moved from its 31 to the La Habra five before 
giving the ball up. 
</P>
<P>
It was a frustrating night for Johnson, a junior tailback who entered the game 
as Orange County's second-leading rusher, averaging 165 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson gained 131 yards in 29 carries and scored the Highlanders' first 
touchdown, but except for his efforts, La Habra's offense was anemic -- the 
rest of the offense gained 40 yards total. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Geoff Grenier, a 6-2, 225-pound running back, broke 
through the La Habra defensive front and managed to outrun the secondary for a 
45-yard touchdown. Grenier led Fullerton rushers with 95 yards in eight 
carries.

CANYON'S DEFENSE STYMIES FOOTHILL FOR A 12-3 VICTORY

Canyon's Darren Lish threw a pair of second-half touchdown passes to George 
Garcia to lead the Comanches to a 12-3 victory over Foothill in the Century 
League opener for both teams Friday at Tustin High School. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's offense sputtered in the first half, gaining only three first downs 
and committing three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Comanche defense held Foothill scoreless until it surrendered a 26-yard 
field goal by Keo Powell with 33 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our kids that everything that could have gone wrong for us in the first 
half did go wrong and we were only down three," Canyon Coach Loren Shumer said. 
</P>
<P>
And the offense did get it together. Canyon (3-3 overall, 1-0 in league), after 
forcing Foothill (1-5, 0-1) to punt, took the ball at the Knights' 37. Lish hit 
Jeff Brunswig for a 54-yard completion that set up a Canyon first-and-goal at 
the nine. A holding play pushed the ball back to the 19, but two plays later 
Lish threw 16 yards to Garcia for the score. Greg Lawrence's extra-point 
attempt hit the crossbar and bounced back, making the score 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon defense forced another Foothill punt, giving the Comanches the ball 
at their own 41. Brunswig did most of the work for Canyon as he carried four 
times for 39 yards on the nine-play drive. Garcia capped it when he caught a 
21-yard pass from Lish. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

Valencia High School made the right plays when they were needed in its Orange 
League opener against Savanna, coming away with a 27-17 victory at Glover 
Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (6-0, 1-0) showed why the Tigers have won or tied for the Orange 
League championship the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna -- which forfeited all of its games last season for using an ineligible 
player and lost a share of the league championship -- tried to play catch-up 
with Valencia, but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia jumped to a 14-0 lead in the second quarter on touchdowns by 
quarterback Marc O'Brien and running back Korey Alexander, with Dave Greer 
kicking the extra points. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna (3-2-1, 0-1) scored with 10 seconds left in the second quarter on a 
pass from quarterback Brad Belanger to Vince Flores. Savanna attempted a 
two-point conversion, but failed. Scott Thompson added a 35-yard field goal in 
the third, making the score 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, the Tigers' Willie Barnes romped in from 10 yards out, 
giving the Valencia a 21-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Belanger, who completed 20 of 35 passes for 259 yards, hit Flores with a 
touchdown pass in the fourth quarter and Jeff Ragos scored on a two-point 
conversion.

<P>
Minici threw touchdown passes of 25 and 55 yards as Irvine (5-1) came back from 
a 7-6 second-quarter deficit for the victory in front of 4,500.

Loara Coach John deFries had a modest game plan Friday night -- contain El 
Dorado's running game, and establish his own. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, deFries had succeeded on both accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Loara's defense held El Dorado to minus-7 yards rushing, while the Loara 
offense rolled up 187 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Loara led, 28-0, at the half, and won, 37-6, the Empire League opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally put a game together," deFries said. "Execution was the key 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Loara tailback Sean Easter -- a transfer from Servite -- gained 23 yards on the 
first play from scrimmage. The Saxons (3-3, 1-0) capped the drive with a 
three-yard off-tackle run by Easter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Loara fullback David Kang rammed straight ahead from two 
yards out for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On Loara's next possession, quarterback Charles Gipson kept the ball and headed 
down the right sideline, then cut back inside and into the end zone for a 
42-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays after Bryan Blanks intercepted a Jason Bluth pass at the El Dorado 
18-yard line, Easter broke a pair of tackles and sprinted 17 yards for another 
touchdown and a 28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Luigi Gagow led Loara with 76 yards rushing in 16 attempts. Easter carried 
eight times for 71 yards. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado (1-5, 0-1) hasn't won since beating Century, 34-9, in the season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado finally scored after sophomore quarterback Jim Beck -- replacing 
Bluth -- led the Hawks 80 yards in nine plays in the third quarter. Sophomore 
Bryan Warner capped the drive with a one-yard touchdown dive. STUART MATTHEWS

Laguna Hills High School scored two touchdowns in the third quarter to beat 
Costa Mesa, 21-14, in a Pacific Coast League game Friday night at Orange Coast 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 7-7, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third quarter, Hawks' defensive back Dave Childs intercepted 
Mustang quarterback Ryan McEvoy's pass and returned it 66 yards for a 
touchdown. Midway through the quarter, running back Marwan Saba broke a tackle 
and scrambled 20 yards to give the Hawks (4-2) the game-winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:39 left in the game, the Mustangs almost got back into the game when 
McEvoy completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to Duby Ospina. But the Hawks' 
defense toughened and held Costa Mesa (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills quarterback Casey Sullivan threw for 82 yards in 11 attempts and

Greg Thurston of Orange Coast College has found the perfect distraction after 
his long hours on the football field. He throws things. 
</P>
<P>
But Thurston is very particular about the objects he hurls. He doesn't just 
pick up a rock and fling it across a field. Instead, the discus and shotput are 
the objects of choice. And he excels. 
</P>
<P>
Thurston was a top-flight discus and shotput competitor at Edison High School 
before continuing with OCC's track and field team last spring. He set the 
Orange Empire Conference record in the discus with a throw of 161 feet 2 inches 
in the conference meet in May. 
</P>
<P>
While proud of his accomplishments, Thurston still talks of his field events as 
a "hobby" and sees them as an outlet for his need for achievement. 
</P>
<P>
On the football field, Thurston is a sophomore offensive tackle for Orange 
Coast, which plays host to Southwestern at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"In track, you like the team to do well, but it's really an individual sport," 
Thurston said. "In football, we have to work as a group on the line. If you're 
not all together, nothing (good) will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Thurston arrived at Orange Coast from Edison, where he spent two years as a 
reserve before starting on the football team as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
He was injured in a preseason scrimmage at OCC last year, but returned two 
games into the season and started the rest of the way. He was 6 feet 5 and 225 
pounds last season. This season, he is 30 pounds heavier, thanks to a serious 
commitment to weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
OCC Coach Bill Workman considered moving him to guard to take advantage of his 
quickness. But part of the left tackle's job is to prevent quarterbacks from 
getting hit from the blindside, and Thurston stayed at the position because 
Workman figured he would be too hard to replace. 
</P>
<P>
"He is our best athlete along the line," Workman said. "He is the whole 
package; he has good athletic ability and great, great character." 
</P>
<P>
Thurston, 19, plans to stay at OCC this spring to finish some academic work so 
he can move on to a four-year college. But he's not sure that he will be back 
on the track team. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I want to stick with football from here out," he said. "I figure I can 
get a scholarship to play at least two more years. I'll just wait and see what 
happens before I think about track. But I would like to do it. It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
In other Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (4-1, 2-1) at Fullerton (4-0, 3-0), 7 p.m. -- Fullerton moved up to 
No. 2 in the national J.C. Grid-Wire poll, and El Camino, which was ranked 
first before a 24-14 loss to Riverside last week, fell to No. 8. The teams have 
combined for 374 points in their last six meetings, and this season shouldn't 
be much different. Each team is averaging 435 yards a game. Fullerton leads the 
conference in rushing with 290 yards a game. El Camino averages 205 yards, led 
by Anthony Daigle, who leads the conference with 662 yards in 111 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (4-0, 3-0) vs. Palomar (1-4, 0-3) at San Marcos HS, 1:30 p.m. -- 
Golden West takes its outstanding defense south to take on the state's best 
offense. Golden West, ranked No. 11 in the nation, is allowing 195 yards a 
game, second best in the state. Palomar's no-huddle offense is averaging 494 
yards a game. The statistic most in Golden West's favor is interceptions. The 
Rustlers are tied with Pasadena for first in the conference with 10. Palomar's 
Bret Salisbury has passed for 1,580 yards (139 for 228), but also leads the 
conference with 12 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern (1-4, 0-3) at Orange Coast (3-1, 2-1), 7 p.m. -- OCC's defense 
ranks second behind Golden West's, and is allowing 261 yards a game. More 
important, the Pirates have allowed just four touchdowns in four games, and 
only one rushing. Injuries have hurt OCC's depth. The teams are nearly 
identical offensively. Southwestern averages 334 yards a game and OCC averages 
329. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (4-1, 2-1) vs. Rancho Santiago (2-2, 1-2) at Santa Ana Stadium, 7 p.m. 
-- Rancho Santiago is trying to snap a two-game losing streak. Pasadena's only 
loss was to Fullerton two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City (0-5, 0-3) at Saddleback (2-2, 2-1), 7 p.m. -- Saddleback has 
won two in a row and is the favorite in this game. San Diego City is last in 
the conference in total offense and defense, averaging 189 yards a game on 
offense, and allowing an average of 389. Saddleback is averaging 328 yards a 
game in offense and allowing 279.

<P>
MOORPARK COLLEGE'S STANDOUT TAILBACK SHOWS BIG HEART AND A FEEL FOR GOAL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freddie Bradley does not cry often, but when he does, it is a gully-washer. 
</P>
<P>
It is the kind of outburst one would not expect from one of the top junior 
college running backs in the nation, a back so durable that he led the nation 
in scoring last season as a Moorpark College freshman, a back so tough that he 
refuses to show fear on the field, a back so physical that he hunts for 
defenders to punish. 
</P>
<P>
It is the kind of sob, though, that one might expect from a man who has bottled 
up the emotions of a life that has been far more difficult than anything he has 
ever faced in football. 
</P>
<P>
This tough guy does not cry on the field, but his talent at a violent game 
masks a gentler side of Freddie Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a softie. I'm sure if he watched 'Wuthering Heights' or 'Where the Red 
Fern Grows' or even 'Flipper,' he'd cry," said George Machado, Bradley's high 
school coach and the man who took Bradley into his home four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley might be the kind of person who would cry after watching "Terms of 
Endearment," and terms of endearment break him down in real life as well. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Machado lectured Bradley for staying out late and then, "I said, 'Fred 
you have to understand I love you,' and that was it. That turned on the 
faucets." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bradley: "I have the same feelings for him." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, though, when Bradley leads Moorpark against Bakersfield in a game that 
could have national-title implications, don't expect any tears to be shed 
between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is attempting to help Moorpark win the mythical national title and also 
is closing in on the national junior college record for career rushing 
touchdowns in the regular season, which is held by O. J. Simpson and two other 
players. With 31 regular-season rushing touchdowns, Bradley is 12 short of the 
record and has six games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has a nose for the end zone like the swallows have a notion for San 
Juan Capistrano. He had 23 touchdowns last season to lead the nation in 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Goals. The goal line has defined Bradley's junior college career and a national 
title would cap it. It is quite a departure from a past in which Bradley's main 
goal was to have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger, the only thing I wanted to do was have fun," Bradley said. 
"I didn't want to do anything else, no responsibilities, going to class or 
anything. I just wanted to go out and party and chase girls. (I'm) still 
chasing girls and stuff, but I know when to party and when not to party." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley grew up in Helena, Ark., a small town on the Mississippi River. His 
mother died when he was 3, and he moved in with his maternal grandmother. He 
essentially has lost contact with his father and says "I don't really worry 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
He accompanied his sister to California when he was in the seventh grade and by 
the time he hit high school, he was a surly kid who would rather pick a fight 
than pick up a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Bradley was the man of the house. He says his older brother has 
drifted in and out of jail and has been merely a ghost in his life. 
</P>
<P>
The misdirection might be one of his best plays now, but in those years 
misdirection simply described the path his life was taking. 
</P>
<P>
"Just went out and partied a lot, didn't go to school," Bradley said of his 
younger years. "I was drinking, smoked a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley says he has put marijuana and cigarette smoking behind him and he never 
got in trouble with the law. "I got lucky on that one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, before his junior year at Hueneme High, Bradley made one of those 
across-the-grain cutbacks he does so well on the field. With one move, he began 
to turn his life around. 
</P>
<P>
The sister Bradley was living with moved back to Arkansas, and Bradley showed 
up in Machado's office with his worldly possessions stuffed in a pair of trash 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bringing him home for dinner, and he stays four years," said Machado, who 
was beginning his first season as Hueneme coach. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, the arrangement looked like the kind of deal that gives high 
school football a bad name. Here was a coach taking in his star player, 
seemingly just to keep him on the team. Machado even moved his wife and 
daughter from Camarillo to Port Hueneme to keep Bradley within school 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Machado jokes that "Freddie looks at me for advice, and I looked to Freddie for 
touchdowns," but Machado provided the male role model and disciplinarian 
Bradley never had. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started going to Hueneme, I started realizing that I could go to 
college and that was one of the main things that turned it around," Bradley 
said. "Then, living with coach, he helped me a lot telling me I could make it 
and it started sinking in." 
</P>
<P>
Machado has pledged to pay for Bradley's college education and take care of him 
even if Bradley never plays another down. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not boarding at my house. He's a part of the family," Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
It was an adjustment for both parties, but now Bradley calls Machado a father 
and says he and Machado's 12-year-old daughter Lindsay "fight like brothers and 
sisters." 
</P>
<P>
Machado constantly hectored Bradley about school, responsibility and the like, 
but he mixed a strong dose of humor with the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
So many girls were chasing Bradley that Machado put a chart like a tournament 
bracket on the refrigerator. The list peaked at 13 girls. When a girl fell out 
of Bradley's favor, she would be eliminated from the bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's female admirers called so frequently that Machado was forced to get 
an unlisted phone number. 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, the Machados would have a soul food night in an attempt to bridge 
the cultural gap. Gradually, the shy youngster came out of his shell. 
</P>
<P>
For the duration of this football season, Bradley has moved in with Larry and 
Laura Felix, a Moorpark family, to cut down on the commute. He plans to return 
to the Machados after the season and perhaps finish his last semester at nearby 
Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
Machado and Bradley still talk frequently on the phone, and Machado attends as 
many Moorpark games as possible. 
</P>
<P>
It is a strange combination, Machado a raspy-voiced, machine-gun talking man 
who wears his emotions on his sleeve and Bradley, a quiet person who generally 
hides his feelings under a manhole. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley keeps his strutting between the white lines. Quick to credit his 
offensive line, Bradley has even turned down opportunities to be Moorpark's 
captain. "He just wants to be part of the team," Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He might want to blend into the team, but any time Moorpark enters a stadium, 
the buzz is about Bradley. He is a standout in what Hank Ives, editor of J. C. 
Grid-Wire, calls "an incredible year for running backs." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Estrus Crayton of Rancho Santiago are regarded as the best junior 
college running backs in California and perhaps the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Freddie has a little more power," Ives said. "They're both exceptional. Coming 
along in the same year, that's something else." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Bradley was a little rough around the edges, surviving on raw 
physical talent and running through defensive players rather than around them. 
</P>
<P>
Known as a "north-south" runner, Bradley does not waste much time running 
laterally but simply heads upfield. 
</P>
<P>
"One time against Valley, we ran a dive play with him, and I don't think anyone 
got out of their stances," Bittner said. "He was by them before they even 
blinked." 
</P>
<P>
He still runs too upright and could use work on his blocking, but Bradley is 
becoming more of a running back and less of a runner. 
</P>
<P>
"He's big, strong, fast and tough," said one major college assistant, who added 
that Bradley would play tailback at the Division I level. "He's got everything 
you look for." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley carries 195 to 200 pounds on his 6-foot frame like Pat Riley wears an 
Armani suit. He says he has a best of 4.38 seconds in the 40-yard dash and can 
bench-press 375 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 15 games of his Moorpark career, Bradley has rushed for 2,015 
yards. That's slightly more than a mile, but few men could run a mile in his 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley takes, and gives, a fearsome pounding in games. He played most of his 
senior season in high school with an injured Achilles' tendon. "He was in such 
extreme pain, it hurt me to watch him run," Machado said. "Fred is probably one 
of the most courageous players I ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, against L. A. Southwest and its giant defensive ends -- Chris Mims 
(6-foot-6, 235) and Bernard Dafney (6-7, 290) -- Bradley carried the ball 10 
times on the opening drive alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I carry the ball, (the more) I get into a good groove and I know I'll 
break one after a while," said Bradley, who has 681 rushing yards and 11 
touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley shrugs off pain and fear like he shrugs off tacklers. Before the Santa 
Monica game this season, freshman fullback Jamal Anderson approached Bradley. 
The players knew Santa Monica would be the most physical team Moorpark had 
faced thus far, and Anderson confided that he was a little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
After calming Anderson, Bradley shredded Santa Monica for 178 rushing yards and 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday after that Santa Monica game, Bradley showed up at school with a 
banged-up shoulder and sporting abrasions, chips off his body, the size of 
nickels and dimes. On his knee was an open wound the size of a silver dollar. 
Such is the price he pays. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bradley exacts a toll in return. "If you hit Freddie hard, he's going 
to come at you harder," Anderson said. "He remembers who you are." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley considers most defensive backs the football equivalents of Yugos. 
Against Southwest this season, Bradley virtually put his fist through a 
defensive back's face mask with a straight-arm that sent the dazed back 
spinning away while Bradley completed a 58-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Barring catastrophic injury, Bradley will find that the football takes care of 
itself. At this stage of his career, the AA appellation he needs is on an 
Associate of Arts degree rather than an All-American certificate. 
</P>
<P>
The AA degree is Bradley's ticket to ride. As a Proposition 48 non-qualifier 
out of high school, he needs the degree to matriculate to a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing nationwide recruiting attention, Bradley is considering Arkansas, 
Colorado, Tennessee, Nevada Las Vegas and USC among others. With only two years 
of eligibility remaining, Bradley is most interested in playing immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's approach to school is no different than that of many athletes or even 
much of the Moorpark student body. He simply is more honest than most when he 
discusses school. 
</P>
<P>
"I just go because I have to," Bradley said. "I don't like school, I like going 
there and seeing the girls and stuff like that, but I don't like school much." 
</P>
<P>
Currently carrying 15 units, Bradley already has completed 32 and is on track 
to finish the required 60 units for an AA degree in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know if I go to classes, I can get a full ride to a university," said 
Bradley, who said he is not bothered by the pressure of having to fulfill 
academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley struggled academically last spring. After wrecking Machado's truck one 
day on the way to school, he was dependent upon other students for rides. The 
precarious ride situation was one factor behind a slew of missed classes, and 
Bradley ended up flunking two courses. 
</P>
<P>
"I say he's been educationally deprived. Not by any means does he lack 
intelligence," Machado said. "He's becoming now, I think, a more dedicated 
student." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley took U. S. history and speech over the summer and passed both classes, 
but again it followed another tough talk from Machado. 
</P>
<P>
After the spring problems, Machado sat Bradley down and told him that if he did 
not buckle down and pass the classes during summer school, there would be no 
football that fall. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the speech, Machado said, "Fred, I love you too damn much to let 
you screw up." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley wept.

QUARTZ HILL STUNS CANYON, 12-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The calendar says mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
But a quick glance at the Quartz Hill High football team screaming and hugging 
and dancing and just generally going bonkers out on Canyon's field Friday night 
showed a playoff-style celebration. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Let the Rebels yell. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, Quartz Hill made Golden League history by felling league giant 
Canyon, 12-6, in a league opener. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels did it by outhitting the hard-hitting Cowboys. They did it by 
executing better than the normally flawless Cowboys. And they did it by making 
bigger plays than the traditionally well-prepared Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Quartz Hill (4-2) deserved the honor of being the first team to 
defeat a Harry Welch-coached team on Canyon's own turf and only the second team 
to defeat Canyon in league play in Welch's nine years. 
</P>
<P>
In their wake, the Rebels left some rather stunned Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for some hemlock," Welch said, tongue in cheek. "Give me a 
cigarette and a mask. But the reason why they won is that they just played 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The winning score came on a six-yard pass from Rebel quarterback Jake Haro to 
Josh Patterson with just 2 minutes 19 seconds remaining and capped a 
seven-minute, 72-yard drive. It was set up on a third-and-seven play-action 
pass from Haro to Rob Keller that netted 38 yards to the Cowboy 19 and swung 
all momentum to the Rebel sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"To win big games, you gotta gamble some," Quartz Hill Coach John Albee said. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 12-6, Canyon (5-1) started a hurry-up drive that moved the Cowboys to 
the Rebel 44-yard line with slightly more than a minute left. For a moment, it 
appeared as if Canyon might pull off the necessary heroics. 
</P>
<P>
But any heroics were Quartz Hill's. Cornerback David Nelson picked off a Kevin 
Bialas bomb intended for Matt Sinnott at the 15-yard line. Bedlam on the Rebel 
sideline was starkly contrasted by a glum feeling among Canyon's homecoming 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was gonna beat me, 'cause both my legs were hurt," Nelson said. 
"But it was right in my hands and then I dropped it into my legs and closed my 
knees." 
</P>
<P>
He also closed out the Cowboys. Canyon had tied the score on a 17-yard 
fourth-quarter pass from Bialas to Jason Swan. Matt George missed the 
point-after and the score remained tied, 6-6. Quartz Hill then embarked on its 
time-consuming and Cowboy-killing drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon loss throws the league race out of whack. Coming into the game, 
Welch had said that the loser of this game would have "no chance" of winning 
the Golden League championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we'll be fighting for second or third," Welch said. "But that's 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
Reality also meant that, without injured runners Dave McDivitt and Mark Santos, 
Canyon rushed for just 77 yards on the ground. But a rowdy Rebel defense had 
much to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rebels ran for 186 ground yards (Nelson led with 72) in 
controlling the pace for much of the night.

EL TORO BEATS CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Toro High kept Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley from reaching the end zone on 
11 plays inside its 21-yard line in final five minutes of play to earn a 23-19 
victory Friday night in front of an overflow crowd of 8,100 at Mission Viejo 
High. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro cornerback Jason Bailey knocked down a pass intended for Capistrano 
Valley's David Poltl in the end zone with 2:21 remaining to play and then the 
Chargers survived two plays in the final 27 seconds to win its sixth 
consecutive game and avenge last year's 22-21 loss that decided the top team in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The game featured two of the county's premier passers -- Solliday and El Toro's 
Rob Johnson -- but it was two goal-line stands by El Toro's defense that proved 
to be the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill 12, Canyon Country Canyon 6 -- Quartz Hill scored the winning 
touchdown on a six-yard pass from quarterback Jake Haro to Josh Patterson with 
2:19 left to give the Rebels a Golden League upset victory at Canyon. Quartz 
Hill improved to 1-0 in league play and 4-2 overall. Canyon, the Times' 
second-ranked Southern Section team, dropped to 0-1 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont 14, Glendora 7 -- Claremont Coach Bob Baiz picked up his 100th career 
victory as the Wolfpack upset previously undefeated Glendora in a Baseline 
League game at Citrus College. Quarterback Adam Metwalli connected with Ryan 
Wall on a four-yard touchdown pass play in the third quarter to put Claremont 
ahead, 11-7. Brandy Braxton added a 40-yard field for the Wolfpack, 2-1 in 
league and 3-3 overall, in the fourth quarter. Glendora slipped to 2-1 and 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey 37, Crenshaw 0 -- Dorsey, the Times' top-ranked City team, improved to 
5-0 with a Pacific League win at Crenshaw. Quarterback Ronald Peebles completed 
eight of 14 passes for 124 yards and one touchdown and running back Sharmon 
Shah gained 66 yards in nine carries to lead the Dons. Dorsey senior running 
back Lamont Warren, who missed the last two games with an ankle injury, gained 
47 yards in 10 carries. Crenshaw is 0-2 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles 44, Hamilton 14 -- Wide receiver Traivon Johnson caught touchdown 
passes of 35, 66 and 18 yards from quarterback Chauncey Jackson in the City 
Coastal Conference game at L.A. L.A. is 1-1 and 2-2, Hamilton 0-1 and 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
Locke 39, Jordan 0 -- Running back Antoine Redmond gained 137 yards in 11 
carries and scored on touchdown runs of six and 14 yards to lead the Saints to 
a Central League win at Jordan. Kimo Dunn added 41 yards in six carries and 
scored three touchdowns for Locke. The Saints amassed 353 rushing yards, and 
Jordan was held to 60. Locke, 2-1 in the Southeastern Conference and 4-1 
overall, led 27-0 at halftime. Jordan is 0-5 and 0-4.

Great Normand, a 181-1 shot, turned in the biggest thoroughbred upset in the 
history of the Meadowlands Racetrack Friday night by winning the $500,000 
Meadowlands Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Great Normand, ridden by Carlos Lopez, win the race for 
3-year-olds and up, he did it like a champion against a 10-horse field that 
included Preakness winner Summer Squall, highly regarded Opening Verse, Beau 
Genius, who came in with a six-race winning streak, and Mi Selecto, last year's 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Great Normand carried 113 pounds and covered the 1 1/8-mile course in 1:47 1/5, 
finishing 2 3/4 lengths ahead of Norquestor. The 5-year-old son of Monteverdi 
paid $364.80, $91.40 and $15.60. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Genius, the 122-pound highweight who battled with Norquestor for the early 
lead, finished third. Summer Squall, carrying 119 pounds, never got closer than 
fifth place and eventually faded to eighth. Mi Selecto was fourth with Opening 
Verse sixth.

took a 7-6 lead late in the third quarter on a seven-yard Fossati run. Blanks'

North Hollywood High basketball standout Jacinda Sweet has narrowed to five her 
list of Division I schools with which she is considering signing a letter of 
intent, according to Coach Rich Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet will take recruiting trips on five successive weekends, beginning this 
Saturday with Arizona. Allen said that Sweet also is considering Washington, 
Cal, Oregon State and defending NCAA champion Stanford.

CURSE HANGS OVER MOORPARK SOCCER STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A men's soccer match Friday afternoon that was terminated two minutes before 
the end of regulation play might terminate Moorpark College's team's winning 
streak as well. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Moorpark, which has won its first 10 matches this season, was leading 
Hancock, 2-1, in the Western State Conference match when the referee ended it 
after a verbal dispute with Moorpark Coach Frank Parodi. 
</P>
<P>
"The referee stopped play because he was going to throw me out," Parodi said. 
"At this moment, we don't know whether the results are going to hold or not. We 
should know Monday morning. . . . We've got to find out whether a forfeit has 
been declared." 
</P>
<P>
Parodi said that he had grown frustrated over the officiating, and "(the 
referee) claims I called him a vulgar name and that's when he stopped the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
If the match stands as a Moorpark victory, the Raiders will improve to 11-0, 
6-0 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Shaun Christensen scored a goal and assisted Jeff Spach on Moorpark's other 
goal. Should the match be forfeited to Hancock, 1-0, the goals would not count.

NOTRE DAME EARNS TIE WITH LATE TOUCHDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame High scored with 2 minutes 7 seconds remaining to pull out a 7-7 
Mission League tie against visiting St. Paul on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (1-3-2, 1-0-1 in league play) had a chance to win, but Rick Camarena 
missed a 32-yard field goal with 28 seconds remaining. Camarena's attempt was 
just wide left, sending the kicker to the ground, clasping his head. 
</P>
<P>
With 8:16 remaining, Notre Dame quarterback Steve Colella engineered a 
touchdown drive. Colella completed a 16-yard pass to Kirk Miller (eight 
catches, 101 yards) on third and 14 to keep the drive alive. Three St. Paul 
penalties accounted for 30 yards. After a four-yard sack on second and goal, 
Colella connected with Robbie LeBel on a nine-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney went for the point rather than gamble on a 
two-point conversion. Tim Kosor converted the kick to tie the score, 7-7, with 
2:07 remaining. "This early in the season, we feel like the tie doesn't hurt 
us," Rooney said. "It's never the popular decision (to go for the tie instead 
of the win), but we did." 
</P>
<P>
Colella finished 18 of 30 for 203 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights turned the ball over on four of their six first-half possessions, 
but St. Paul capitalized on just one. 
</P>
<P>
After Notre Dame (3-2-1, 2-0-1) took the opening kickoff, the Knights' Justin 
Mitchell, who finished with just one yard in seven carries in place of injured 
running back Setefano Malieitulua, fumbled on his second carry. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul's Jon Yepes fell on it to give the Swordsmen possession at Notre 
Dame's nine-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Swordsmen used all four downs to get the ball into the end zone. Ryan 
Sweet's two-yard dive and Camarena's extra point gave St. Paul a 7-0 lead less 
that 3:30 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul's Carlos Ramos rushed for a game-high 95 yards in 16 carries, and 
quarterback Albert Borunda finished 15 of 22 for 165 yards and had one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul, which allowed just 17 yards rushing, was called for 13 penalties for 
140 yards, which took the Swordsmen out of several scoring opportunities and 
kept Notre Dame drives alive. 
</P>
<P>
After Notre Dame regained possession with 28 seconds remaining, Rooney 
instructed Colella to kneel on first down and run out the clock.

Aluminum Co. of America: Alcoa said third-quarter profit declined nearly 43% to 
$125 million on revenue of $2.7 billion, which was off 5.6% from 1989. The 
Pittsburgh-based aluminum company said the figures reflect lower earnings from 
its Brazilian operations, a decrease in orders for some fabricated products, 
lower aluminum prices and unfavorable currency-exchange adjustments of $10.9 
million.

FACES . . . : A VETERAN IN STEEL'S 'KALEIDOSCOPE,' COLLEEN DEWHURST STATES HER 
VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.K. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony- and Emmy-winning actress Colleen Dewhurst has never read any of Danielle 
Steel's romantic best-selling novels. She is not even familiar with the titles 
of Steel's books. But that didn't stop Dewhurst from accepting a juicy role 
opposite Jaclyn Smith and Perry King in the NBC movie "Danielle Steel's 
'Kaleidoscope,' " airing Monday at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
King plays a private detective hired by a dying man to find three women who 
were separated as children after the strange deaths of their parents. Dewhurst 
is a wealthy Southern matron who adopted one of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
"I have decided," says Dewhurst with a laugh, "that everyone in these type of 
stories are rich. They wear very beautiful clothes and they have a lot of 
jewelry. They are married to very powerful men." 
</P>
<P>
Starring in such a glitzy movie, says the actress, was fun. "I love to suddenly 
find myself playing posh instead of heavy, heavy hangs the sword." 
</P>
<P>
"Murphy Brown" fans will be pleased to know that Dewhurst makes her annual 
visit to the series Nov. 5 as Murphy's strong-willed mother, Avery. The role 
brought Dewhurst an Emmy last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst also is in her second term as president of Actors Equity. She's only 
the second woman to hold the office since the union was founded in 1913. It was 
Equity that decided to bar English actor Jonathan Pryce from playing a Eurasian 
in the upcoming Broadway production of "Miss Saigon." After heated debates and 
the cancellation of the production, Equity reversed its decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy it came to a conclusion," says Dewhurst. "These situations are not 
attractive. But I think the country became aware that there is a problem (of 
hiring minority actors). The country had no idea this was going on. Minority 
groups stood up for each other within the union. They stood up for the Asian 
group and helped them to fight. I don't think it was a racist issue. What we 
had was a lack of awareness." S.K.

BLACKS IN 'STREETCAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to thank Loynd for his observation that the setting is 1947, blue-collar 
New Orleans and that the Hubbles are definitely written as white. 
</P>
<P>
I had the misfortune to see a production of the same play in which Stanley was 
cast as black! I even saw a production of "Henry V" in which Hal (the English 
prince turned king) was played by a black man! We might as well play "A Raisin 
in the Sun" with whites.

BLACKS IN 'STREETCAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm fit to be tied over Ray Loynd's Sept. 17 review of the LAAT's "almost 
flawless" production of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire." The 
flaw as Loynd squints to see it is the "beautifully played" performances by 
Neva Ruschell and Lance Nichols as the upstairs neighbors, which (to him) 
represent "tinkering" with the untinkerable author because "blacks wouldn't be 
running in and out of the Kowalskis' flat in 1947 New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
This is outright racist hogwash. Williams says nothing about the racial 
composition of Stanley's friends and neighbors who live "at the end of the 
trolley line." It is poor, noisy and rough and, more than likely, especially in 
New Orleans -- famous for its interracial mix of blacks, Creoles, Cajuns and 
whites -- the Kowalski digs would reflect that diversity. I've personally seen 
a number of productions, including the original on Broadway, in which the 
street mise-en-scene was interracially cast.

FACES . . . : ANOTHER ENLIGHTENING ROLE FOR DANNER IN HBO'S 'JUDGMENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today is "Judgment" day for HBO, so to speak. The sensitive drama debuts 
tonight at 9, with Tony Award-winner Blythe Danner playing yet another role in 
which she has left the production more enlightened than when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always found it wonderful to get a little bit of sociology and history 
and everything else when working on something," says Danner. "I've always liked 
to play people who exist." 
</P>
<P>
When "Judgment" was first pitched, the networks decided not to take a swing. No 
surprise. This based-on-fact story deals with a couple whose son is encouraged 
by their parish priest into becoming an alter boy. Mom and Dad are thrilled 
about the arrangement until it is learned that their boy, and many others, has 
been sexually abused by the charismatic priest. The church attempts to stave 
off bad publicity by offering hush money. Danner and husband Keith Carradine 
decide to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
By shooting in tiny Lakeview, Fla. (the actual felonies occurred years ago in 
Louisiana), the production may have spared itself a nasty clash with the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was discontent with the archdiocese where we were shooting," 
says Danner. "Not in an overt way did we find that out, but we just heard, you 
know, that there were mumblings of it." 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, the traumatized boy is expertly coached by ace attorney Claude 
Fortler, played by Jack Warden. The child's testimony ultimately decides the 
fate of the wayward cleric. Danner understands that in real life, this result 
is much more difficult to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an area that's never really been explored or entered before. There's this 
sort of omnipresence that the Catholic Church has had on our society since it 
began. It's ruled the world for so many centuries that I just think that this 
concept it has of itself has been infallible. It's something that filters 
through all of society." DAVID PECCHIA

'GINGER TREE': CULTURE CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Ginger Tree" is a slow-evolving come-on with a disappointing payoff. This 
four-part BBC-Japanese co-production (premiering Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channels 
50 and 24, at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15) is intriguing for a while. 
</P>
<P>
The first two episodes of this "Masterpiece Theatre" presentation draw you into 
an almost mystical universe of clashing cultures and feelings while showing the 
loneliness and isolation of Mary McKenzie (Samantha Bond), a Scotswoman who 
travels to Manchuria in 1903 to marry a cold and plodding British army officer 
(Adrian Rawlins). 
</P>
<P>
All but ignored by her mechanical husband, she has an affair with a Japanese 
military attache (Daisuke Ryu), finding in her relationship with this young 
nobleman the lacking warmth and affection. 
</P>
<P>
Bond is radiant as this young woman, trapped first in passionless wedlock and 
then in the country of her married Japanese lover, who brings her to Tokyo to 
bear their child and become his concubine. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted by Christopher Hampton from Oswald Wynd's novel, "The Ginger Tree" is 
lushly and meticulously mounted in England, Japan and Taiwan, its deeply 
fascinating crosscurrent of diverse cultures initially set against the 
darkening clouds of the Russo-Japanese War. Although cruelly victimized by 
Japanese tradition, the spiny and resourceful Mary ultimately adapts to her new 
homeland. As Mary gains assurance, the drop-off in intensity is dramatic. There 
is simply never any doubt where this part of the story is taking you or how it 
will arrive there. It's an unsatisfying resolution to a drama that begins so 
promisingly. HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
This could be one of those rare weekends when all four major team sports -- 
football, basketball, hockey and baseball -- can be seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
USC continues its quest for a fourth consecutive Pacific 10 Conference title 
against Stanford beginning at 12:30 p.m. today on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
UCLA has a week off from conference play and will take on San Diego State at 7 
p.m. on Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The highest ranked team playing on television today is No. 4 Oklahoma, which 
meets Texas at 1 p.m. on ESPN. The game of the day pits No. 5 Tennessee (3-0-2) 
against No. 9 Florida (5-0) at 4:30 p.m. on ESPN and 10:30 p.m. on 
SportsChannel. A week after its upset loss to Stanford and a week before its 
annual grudge match with Miami (Fla.), eighth-ranked Notre Dame faces Air Force 
at 10 a.m. on SportsChannel. 
</P>
<P>
In other games involving ranked teams, No. 22 Indiana plays host to Ohio State 
(9:30 a.m., ESPN) and No. 24 Mississippi visits Georgia (9:30 a.m., TBS). CBS' 
game matches Syracuse and Penn State at 11 a.m. (Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Mid-October is usually not the time for must-win situations in the National 
Football League, but that's where the Rams (1-3) find themselves Sunday in a 
4:30 p.m. game against the Chicago Bears (4-1) on KCAL Channel 9 and TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Other NFL telecasts include the Cincinnati Bengals and Houston Oilers (10 a.m., 
Channel 4); San Diego Chargers and New York Jets (10 a.m., Channel 39); San 
Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons (10 a.m. Channel 8); New York Giants and 
Washington Redskins (1 p.m. Channels 2 and 8) and Raiders and Seattle Seahawks 
(1 p.m. Channel 36). 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' first telecast of the Mike Dunleavy era begins at 8 p.m. tonight 
with an exhibition game against the Portland Trail Blazers on KCAL Channel 9 
and KADY Channel 63. NBC launches its National Basketball Assn. coverage with 
the New York Knicks playing POP (Yugoslavia) for the McDonald's Open 
championship at noon today on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Kings-St. Louis game matches two of the National Hockey League's 
biggest stars, Wayne Gretzky and Blues right wing Brett Hull. Prime Ticket's 
coverage begins at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If a seventh game is necessary to decide the National League championship 
between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds, it will air on Channels 
2 and 8 today, with the first pitch scheduled for 5:27 p.m. STEVEN HERBERT

The networks will battle it out Sunday night with three new TV movies about 
murder, mystery and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
With no baseball scheduled until the World Series begins next Tuesday, CBS 
(2)(8) will air "Murder Times Seven" Sunday at 9 p.m. Richard Crenna reprises 
his role as New York detective Frank Janek, who investigates a mass murder only 
to be hampered by one of the victims' ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
NBC (4)(36)(39) counters with "A Quiet Little Neighborhood, a Perfect Little 
Murder," a goofy little suspense comedy starring Teri Garr and Robert Urich. 
</P>
<P>
ABC (7)(3)(10)(42), meanwhile, offers "In Defense of a Married Man." In this 
courtroom drama, a man (Michael Ontkean) accused of murdering his mistress is 
defended by his wife (Judith Light). 
</P>
<P>
At the same hour Sunday, Channel 9 offers "The Next Disaster -- Are You 
Prepared?" This one-hour special, hosted by Robert Conrad, is designed to help 
viewers survive the next earthquake, flood, tornado or fire by presenting 
footage of past tragedies like Hurricane Hugo and last year's Bay Area 
earthquake, with advice on how to handle such emergencies. STEVE WEINSTEIN

'BOOK OF J' LACKS NERVE TO NAME 'J'; 
</P>
<P>
THE BOOK OF J. TRANSLATED FROM THE HEBREW BY DAVID ROSENBERG; INTERPRETED BY 
HAROLD BLOOM. GROVE WEIDENFELD. $21.95; 340 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, Miles, the Times book editor, is on a year's leave. He has 
written for Jewish Quarterly Review on parody in the Book of Jonah and for 
Semeia on sarcasm in the Book of Job. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Bloom has a lot of nerve, but then again he may not have quite enough. 
"The Book of J," his commentary on David Rosenberg's punning, experimental 
translation of portions of the Old Testament books of Genesis, Exodus and 
Numbers, is both less and more than it seems. 
</P>
<P>
It is less than it seems when the distinguished Yale literary critic writes, at 
the end of his introduction: "I am aware that it may be vain labor, up Sinai 
all the way, as it were, to seek a reversal of twenty-five hundred years of 
institutionalized misreading. . . . Yet the Book of J, though fragmentary, is 
hardly Mr. David Rosenberg's creation or my own. All I have done is to remove 
the Book of J from its context in the Redactor's Torah and then to read what 
remains. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The lay reader may be excused if he takes away from that paragraph the mistaken 
impression that "The Book of J," though not Bloom's creation, is at least his 
discovery. The inconvenient truth is that nothing in biblical interpretation is 
more thoroughly "institutionalized" than the notion that the Bible -- and in 
particular the Pentateuch -- is an edited work. 
</P>
<P>
The use of the letter J as the scholarly tag for the oldest of the four 
documents that after editing became the Pentateuch, is itself a century old. 
The letter stands for Jahve, the German spelling of the name later re-spelled 
in English as Yahweh. Not even the separate publication of the Yahwist document 
is a new idea. In 1968, Peter Ellis published the Jerusalem Bible translation 
of J, with commentary, as "The Yahwist: The Bible's First Theologian" (Fides). 
</P>
<P>
Bloom does not deny any of this. But to put it kindly, he is not, as we say 
these days, "up front" about it. Among those who seem to have been misled we 
must count his publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom's major claim to originality, however, is not the isolation of J but the 
discovery or invention of "The Author J," to whom he devotes the first 60 pages 
of this book. "As we read any literary work," he writes, "we necessarily create 
a fiction or metaphor of its author. That author is perhaps our myth, but the 
experience of literature partly depends on that myth. For J, we have a choice 
of myths, and I boisterously prefer mine to that of the biblical scholars. I 
will put all my cards on the reader's desk here, face up. My J is a Gevurah 
("great lady") of post-Solomonic court circles, herself of Davidic blood, who 
began writing her great work in the later years of Solomon, in close rapport 
and exchanging influences with her good friend the Court Historian, who wrote 
most of what we now call 2 Samuel." 
</P>
<P>
Boisterously, let me suggest that Bloom's most important card is not on the 
reader's desk at all. Bloom has lifted the notion that the author of J may have 
been a woman from Richard Elliott Friedman, of UC San Diego, who proposed it in 
1987 in his book "Who Wrote the Bible?" (Summit). Bloom cites this work in 
passing but does not credit Friedman for the provocative hypothesis that Bloom 
has placed at the center of his own work. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that Bloom's work is without originality? Not quite: "The Book 
of J" is a work of modest, if truncated, originality. Its method is circular 
and unabashedly subjective but, in my view, legitimate and, on occasion, 
brilliantly brought off. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom infers a personality for his "great lady" from what she has written; 
namely, the received "Yahwistic" source of Pentateuch scholarship. Then, 
allowing the inferred personality to feed his imagination, he reads the text 
again and allows himself to notice what he might at first have missed. The 
text, now more deeply and artistically understood, further specifies the 
imagined personality of the author. 
</P>
<P>
This method leads Bloom to four principal assertions: 
</P>
<P>
1. J and Yahweh are both in love with David. In another Pentateuchal source, 
man is created in the image and likeness of God. In Bloom's J, Yahweh is 
created in the image and likeness of Israel's exuberant founding monarch. 
</P>
<P>
2. J and Yahweh are decidedly cool toward the stiff and stammering Moses and 
oddly detached, even ironic, toward the Mosaic religion. "The Yahwist herself 
is not a Yahwist," Bloom writes. 
</P>
<P>
3. David aside, J and Yahweh respond more to vigorous women than to even the 
most vigorous men. "There is a grand hardness in J's women," Bloom writes, "in 
Sarai, Rebecca, Rachel, Tamar, and Zipporah, a hardness that perhaps J found in 
herself, or in Solomon's mother, Bathsheba. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
4. J and Yahweh are cool not just to Moses but also to the Israelite rank and 
file. They are aristocrats, in a word; their affections go to the chosen among 
the chosen: "A lifelong monarchist, as I read her, a distruster of priests and 
people alike, she had more faith in David than in Yahweh." 
</P>
<P>
More than can appear in such an enumeration, these are earned insights. Bloom 
may go perversely to those verses that most critics find peripheral or even 
undecipherable and ignore those verses, even in J, that most critics find 
central. The result, nonetheless, has impressive internal coherence. Bloom's 
essays "The Representation of Yahweh" and "The Psychology of Yahweh" present a 
god with a daylight clarity that can be stunning. 
</P>
<P>
And yet there is, even on Bloom's own aesthetic and free-wheeling terms, both a 
structural weakness in his work and, as noted, a failure of nerve. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom never asks after the overall aesthetic effect of the removal of those 
other materials that were combined with J by the ancient redactor. We may grant 
that their removal throws J into relief. What else does it do? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that this removal produces an effect rather like that of an opera 
cut to just the arias or a film with all the dissolves and fade outs, all the 
continuity, eliminated. Looked at one way, J without the rest of the Pentateuch 
is clean and masterful narrative; looked at another way, it is just "Bible 
stories" for children. Bloom writes, intuitively (and defensively): "We need to 
be like wise children in reading or listening to J, because her mode, and not 
just in the primeval history of humankind, is like a more sophisticated kind of 
children's literature than we now possess." There is a question here that needs 
more attention than Bloom has given it. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the structural weakness. The failure of nerve is Bloom's failure to 
see how directly his evidence suggests that his "great lady" is Bathsheba. The 
wife of a Hittite and almost certainly a Hittite or a Canaanite herself, 
Bathsheba -- as a nubile young woman -- seduced the much older David even as 
Tamar, the Adullamite, seduced the older Judah. If Bathsheba is Bloom's J, we 
need not wonder that her sympathies tend so powerfully toward Tamar, that 
earlier Gentile who forced her way into Israel's destiny and whom Bloom calls 
"of all J's heroines . . . the most revelatory of J's identity . . . the most 
memorable character in the Book of J." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, either, that David's wife should be so in love with David as to take 
him as her model for the personality of God. Or that this foreign woman should 
look with such studied coolness on Moses and on the fiercer, more moralistic 
strand of Yahweh-worship that he represented. 
</P>
<P>
As we read in 2 Samuel, Bathsheba did not blush when she asked whether Abishag, 
David's last concubine, was still a virgin after he had begun to sleep with her 
(she was). It is entirely possible that this indomitable queen mother survived 
her son Solomon as well as her husband, taking herself -- quite as Bloom 
suggests -- as the model for all those "hard" women of her own patriarchal 
narratives, not least for the two -- Sarai and Rebecca -- who make impolite 
jokes about the sexual limitations of elderly men. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, once her hapless grandson Rehoboam has betrayed the Davidic 
legacy, who better than the queen mother to weave regal indignation into the 
warp and woof of Israel's foundation myth? It all fits. Why does Bloom, 
otherwise so acute, fail to see it? 
</P>
<P>
He fails, in my view, because he has an agenda in "The Book of J" which 
requires the repudiation of the very insight that made his reputation in "The 
Anxiety of Influence." In that book, Bloom taught us that a literary successor 
can escape the humiliation of being merely a successor by a "strong misreading" 
of his predecessor, strong misreading being the kind of deliberate, calculated 
error that brings new truth into view. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Book of J," by sharpest contrast with "The Anxiety of Influence," Bloom 
wants history to stop. The earliest stratum of Yahwism is the only one worthy 
of consideration. No strong misreadings here. All successors, beginning with 
Moses, are seen as weak "misreaders," mere corrupters. 
</P>
<P>
But are they so in fact? Bloom, Yahweh's psychoanalyst, cannot fail to see the 
intrinsic interest in watching God's character change as the rest of the Hebrew 
Bible comes into being. But then can that process halt at the end of the Hebrew 
Bible? What is there to prevent Israel's masterpiece from becoming, as Bloom 
bitterly puts it, "the Protestant Bible, in which the Hebrew Scriptures dwindle 
down to that captive prize of the Gentiles, the Old Testament"? 
</P>
<P>
The New Testament is, of course, the strongest, most outrageously successful 
misreading in history. If Bloom had the nerve to honor that misreading in the 
same spirit in which he honors Tamar for winning "a central place in the story 
that she was not born into and so had to usurp for herself," then he could also 
recognize all the greatness that intervenes -- the greatness of Moses, not to 
speak of Jeremiah (whom he professes to despise) and Isaiah and Job. And if he 
had the nerve to do all that, then he might have the nerve to face the 
implication in his own research that the Hebrew Bible was a Gentile captive in 
its opening moments; that as perhaps only Bloom would ever have the nerve to 
put it, Bathsheba invented Yahweh.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CHARGES FILED IN SLAYING OF AIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murder charges have been filed against a reputed gang member who was arrested 
in the slaying of a serviceman after photos taken of the suspect by a hidden 
security camera were broadcast on the news, prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Moore, 18, was to be arraigned in Torrance Municipal Court on Wednesday 
on one count of murder, three counts of attempted murder and one count of 
shooting into an occupied motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Moore killed Darrell Webb, 20, an Air Force airman, after the 
victim whistled at the defendant's girlfriend at the South Bay Bowling alley in 
Torrance on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Webb and three of his friends then drove away, but were followed by Moore and 
his girlfriend. When the two cars pulled up to a light, Moore fatally shot Webb 
in the chest, prosecutors said.

SIGN MAKER ANGRY OVER BUDGET CRISIS HAS MESSAGE FOR CONGRESS: GET SERIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ira Spector can't sleep these days. He's too busy watching the congressional 
debates over the budget deficit that are rebroadcast overnight on the C-SPAN 
television channel. 
</P>
<P>
And what he sees makes Spector an angry voter, an angry taxpayer. Those rascals 
in Washington are playing politics, he says, instead of taking a serious look 
at the budget deficit that in 10 years will be larger than the combined incomes 
of every taxpaying United States citizen. 
</P>
<P>
So Spector, a Solana Beach sign maker, is taking the message to the streets. On 
Friday, he hung three 20-by-3-foot signs from his South Cedros Avenue business 
imploring voters to write their congressmen and senators in Washington with a 
warning: 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them to stop playing politics now," he says. "Or come November we'll 
throw the do-nothing, hypocritical rascals out." 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them on the television, all saying the things that their own 
constituencies want to hear. And we've got a Godforsaken disaster going on in 
this country -- a fiscal crisis that goes beyond politics to affect us and our 
kids and our grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, Spector says, the current budget deficit exceeds $13,000 for every 
man, woman and child in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real, not fake," he said. "It's time these politicians started acting 
like statesmen and stop acting selfishly, worrying about their own elections." 
</P>
<P>
Spector's signs warn local passers-by not only to call their own 
representatives but to telephone out-of-state relatives with the message to 
call their congressmen and senators. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Coronado man, who in 1972 led a North County homeowners revolt 
against a proposed beachfront hotel complex, says he has seen the power of a 
grass-roots rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the message we've got to get out," he said, "that we're not impotent. 
We can do something today about this budget crisis if we band together and let 
these politicians know we really mean business. We want something done." 
</P>
<P>
Spector said the reaction to his banners has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got people talking about the issue," he said. "Now I hope they go home 
and pick up their telephones and dust off their typewriters." 
</P>
<P>
He said he got the idea from a Florida man's recent campaign in which he spent 
more than $60,000 to place full-page ads in several newspapers nationwide 
speaking out against Washington's handling of the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Those ads set the wheels in motion for me," he said. "I said, 'By golly, I'm 
going to do something about this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Local politicians say they're attuned to Spector's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) shares every one of his frustrations," said Lowery 
aide Karl Higgins. "Some members of Congress are addicted to deficit spending. 
Luckily, we don't share that problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get any calls in response to that banner, I'll tell people that we're 
disgusted that we didn't get a solution Oct. 4 when we voted for a budget that 
would have reduced the deficit $500 billion over five years." 
</P>
<P>
An aide for Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said: "Hey, if he wants to use a 
banner to exercise his constitutional right to free speech, that's OK with us. 
We agree with him."

RENOVATION UPSTAGED IN FAVOR OF A NEW THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-running saga of Palmdale's bid to build a performing arts center has 
taken yet another twist, with city officials dumping plans to renovate an old 
auditorium in favor of building a new 400-seat theater on donated land. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 decision Thursday night by the Palmdale City Council was the latest in 
at least four major shifts in the city's theater plans during the past seven 
years. The city's stake in the project has climbed from about $750,000 to $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have come a long way and hopefully made a decision," Mayor Pete 
Knight said. "Only time will tell the rightness of that decision. I think it's 
appropriate we have a new building as opposed to an old building." 
</P>
<P>
Under the latest plan, the city intends to build a 400-seat, 19,000-square-foot 
theater center on 5.7 acres of vacant land east of the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
just south of Palmdale Boulevard. Los Angeles developer Ron Ordin has offered 
to give the land to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city thus abandoned the approach chosen by the council in July -- 
converting the city's Maryott Auditorium, a 40-year-old former school building 
in the downtown area, into a similar 400-seat, 17,400-square-foot theater. City 
officials said either project would total $4 million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were major disputes about the costs of each approach, news that 
the amounts would be similar helped sway a majority of the council in favor of 
a new theater. Knight and council members Joe Davies and Jim Root favored the 
plan, while Janis Hamm and Jim Ledford voted no. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was applauded by the Antelope Valley Cultural Foundation, the 
nonprofit group that has spearheaded the theater project. The foundation wanted 
the new building and has pledged at least $750,000 in private donations toward 
construction and related costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited," said David Milligan, executive director of the 
foundation. He predicted that the city has finally settled on a plan and that 
the project could be completed in 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
However, some have questioned the project because the neighboring city of 
Lancaster has just built a 725-seat civic theater at nearly $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Palmdale council's decision came amid news that a major downturn in 
house construction, a major source of revenue to the city, has produced a 
projected $4-million shortfall in the city's budget. However, city officials 
said they would cut other costs to cover that. 
</P>
<P>
In voting against the project, Hamm warned that the worsening economy and the 
availability of other theater opportunities demanded other uses for the city's 
funds. Ledford, meanwhile, argued that renovating the Maryott would be cheaper 
and better serve the city's downtown revitalization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the city started out with the promise of a $750,000 commitment to help 
renovate the Maryott into a theater. That effort stalled until last year when 
the city settled on an $8-million, 700-seat theater on Ordin's land. But cost 
concerns prompted the switch to the latest, smaller projects.

NEW JUDGE TO HELP SHOULDER HEAVY CASELOAD IN LANCASTER; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERIOR COURT: THE AREA WILL SOON HAVE A FOURTH JUDICIAL OFFICER, BUT SOME SAY 
TWO MORE ARE NEEDED. HUNDREDS OF CIVIL TRIALS ARE ON HOLD.

At the Antelope Valley Courthouse in Lancaster, where a staggering workload has 
forced the creation of makeshift courtrooms and prevented hundreds of civil 
cases from going to trial, officials are welcoming the appointment of a second 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Charles E. Horan, a former Glendale Municipal Court judge and Los Angeles 
County prosecutor, said Friday that he expects to start work in Lancaster in 
about 10 days, after completing a murder trial in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Superior Court Judge Richard P. Byrne said he chose Horan to join 
Judge Margaret M. Grignon in Lancaster Superior Court because of an enormous 
rise in criminal and civil cases that has accompanied the area's population 
growth. In addition to Grignon, two Superior Court commissioners hear juvenile 
and family matters. Horan's arrival will bring the number of judicial officers 
to four. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a demonstrated need for a long period of time," Byrne said in a 
telephone interview Friday. "The percentage of growth in the Antelope Valley 
has been greater than in other parts of the county." 
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases filed in Lancaster Superior Court has tripled 
since 1986 and the number of criminals sent to prison from the court has 
increased fourfold during the same period, according to county statistics. The 
number of civil cases has increased 103% since 1985, with 1,400 civil filings 
projected by the end of the year, Grignon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Grignon, supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley and other Lancaster 
officials have been lobbying for additional judges, citing studies that show 
the caseload calls for at least six judicial officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been talking about this for two years," Cooley said. "It's welcome and 
it's long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said judicial vacancies and a countywide shortage of judgeships delayed 
the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
To keep up with the workload, Grignon has been taking work home and diverting 
some criminal cases to the San Fernando courts. She also has postponed hearing 
civil cases; there has not been a civil trial in Lancaster this year, and last 
year there were only two, Grignon said. 
</P>
<P>
Horan will take over the bulk of criminal cases when he arrives, Grignon said, 
with a juvenile commissioner handling the overflow. Meanwhile, Grignon said she 
will concentrate on civil matters. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, Grignon will leave the Antelope Valley to fill an 
appellate court position to which she was appointed recently. She and other 
officials will meet with County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, seeking a 
commitment that the new judgeship will be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said the decision will be left to the new presiding judge, Ricardo A. 
Torres, who will take over in January. 
</P>
<P>
Horan, 39, comes to Lancaster after three years on the Municipal Court bench. 
Before his appointment in 1987, he was a deputy district attorney in the major 
narcotics and forfeiture section of the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Horan has also gained a name as a part-time rock musician. He plays lead guitar 
in a band named Use a Guitar, Go to Prison.

GROUP ASKS FERRARO TO DROP SUPPORT FOR CRA EXTENSION; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: THE COUNCILMAN HAS INTRODUCED A MOTION TO RENEW THE AGENCY'S 
ABILITY TO SEIZE PROPERTY IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD BEYOND FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 North Hollywood residents and property owners have called on 
Councilman John Ferraro to reverse his support for a measure extending the 
taxing and land seizure powers of the North Hollywood Community Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In the first organized opposition to the extension, five people met with 
Ferraro this week and presented him with a protest petition, an outgrowth of 
earlier protests against the agency's citizens advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The group is continuing to collect signatures, said spokeswoman Mildred Weller, 
owner of an advertising agency in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Under state redevelopment laws, the CRA is authorized to buy land, requiring 
the owners to sell, if necessary. The property is then resold to chosen 
developers at a discount to promote construction of higher-value projects. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the city benefits from increased property taxes on the improved 
land. Some of the increased tax income may return to the redevelopment agency 
to fund other improvements in the area or to recoup the cost of starting the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA's ability to seize property in North Hollywood expires in February. 
With the support of the agency's officials, Ferraro introduced a motion in May 
that would extend that power and also raise the existing $89-million cap on the 
CRA's share of property taxes paid on improved properties within the 740-acre 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro's motion is being studied by the council's Redevelopment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Weller complained that under the CRA, "property is being taken unfairly and 
given to developers. It seems to be a pretty stacked deck against the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there was no true blight in North Hollywood in the first place and 
that the agency shouldn't have come in. They built some beautiful projects, but 
it's a matter of property rights. They took people's property away." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro said Friday that he is discussing the group's objections with CRA 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I share some of their concerns and will look into it," Ferraro said. "Some of 
the buildings they showed me that they were worried would be taken over by CRA 
looked pretty good, and maybe they shouldn't be taken down." 
</P>
<P>
But Ferraro said the project has benefited the community. Since it began 
operating in North Hollywood in 1979, the CRA has sponsored such developments 
as the 10-story television academy building and the 200-unit Magnolia Towers 
senior citizens project. 
</P>
<P>
Weller said her group is organizing against the CRA partly because a citizens 
advisory committee for the redevelopment project changed its bylaws to prevent 
non-members from voting last month in an election to fill vacancies on the 
board. The election was held in a meeting punctuated by catcalls from the 
audience, the latest in a series of disturbances by protesters at the 
committee's meetings.

EX-METZGER AIDE TESTIFIES HE GAVE MESSAGE TO KILLERS

A California white supremacist described to a jury Friday how he passed on the 
violent racist teachings of Tom Metzger to three Portland skinheads hours 
before they beat and kicked a black man to death. 
</P>
<P>
Allen David Mazzella, 21, testified on behalf of the victim's family, which is 
suing Metzger, 52, of Fallbrook, and Metzger's son John, 22. The suit claims 
the leaders of the White Aryan Resistance and its Aryan Youth Movement arm 
incited the savage beating of Ethiopian student Mulugeta Seraw, 27. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million civil suit accuses Metzger of sending Mazzella and two other 
members of his group to Portland in the fall of 1988 to recruit new members and 
to teach a doctrine of hate and violence against blacks and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzella, who testified without immunity from prosecution, said he was acting 
vice president of WAR Youth, a branch of Metzger's group, when he visited 
Portland. He confirmed he was sent by Metzger to recruit new members of WAR 
from East Side White Pride and another Portland skinhead group. 
</P>
<P>
He told the jury he met with members of East Side White Pride only hours before 
three of its members fatally beat and kicked Seraw in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed on behalf of Seraw's uncle by attorney Morris Dees of the 
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., and the Anti-Defamation League 
of B'nai B'rith. It names the Metzgers and two of three skinheads who pleaded 
guilty to the crime, Ken Mieske, 23, and Kyle Brewster, 20. The third, Steven 
Strasser, 20, also is expected to testify for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzella testified that Metzger approved of his violent methods and of his 
recruitment of skinheads to join WAR. 
</P>
<P>
"He was basically patting me on the back for what I was doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But during cross-examination, Metzger reviewed a series of his organization's 
magazines with Mazzella, asking if any of the articles directly incited the 
younger man to attack minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzella said that collectively, the magazines create an impression that 
violence is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
During a short break, while the jury was out of the room, Tom Metzger had one 
of his four bodyguards hand Mazzella a copy of a lawsuit claiming Mazzella and 
several others were testifying as "agent provocateurs," paid or retained by 
Portland police. A police spokesman has denied that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Dees angrily challenged the courtroom presentation of the suit, saying it 
showed "intimidation and coercion from the defendant to the witness." 
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Ancer Haggerty, one of two black circuit judges in Oregon, said 
he would not allow a copy of Metzger's lawsuit to be entered as evidence but 
would let Dees refer to it in his closing arguments.

ARCHER (ARCHIE) E. MCLAURINE; 98-YEAR-OLD BOWLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archer (Archie) E. McLaurine, among the oldest sanctioned league bowlers in the 
United States, has died in Reseda. He was 98. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime Van Nuys resident, McLaurine died Monday of heart failure, said his 
daughter Georgia Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Oak Grove, Mo., he came to California in 1945 and worked as a 
self-employed small appliance repairman. He began bowling 26 years ago and was 
a league member at the Brunswick Matador Bowl in Northridge for the past 12 
years. He bowled as recently as two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's not the oldest, he's certainly one of the oldest sanctioned league 
bowlers in the U.S.," said Tracy Murphy, program director at the bowling alley. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his daughter Georgia Brooks of Van Nuys; five grandchildren; 
eight great-grandchildren; and eight great-great grandchildren. His wife, 
Gladys McLaurine, died in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
A graveside service was held Friday with burial at Rose Hills Memorial Park in 
Whittier. Contributions can be made in McLaurine's name to the charity of the 
donor's choice.

ON CAMPUS: PIERCE COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD-CARE FUNDING IS SLASHED 
</P>

<P>
Cuts in child-care funding at Pierce College and the other eight Los Angeles 
Community College District campuses are limiting the schools' ability to serve 
student parents, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Ryder, Child Development Center director at the Woodland Hills school, 
said the cost of this year's program at Pierce, if run at its present capacity, 
will be $312,835. However, she said she has only about $290,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's center has a capacity of 60 children. Because of state regulations 
regarding teacher-child ratios, six full-time teachers are needed to operate 
the center at that capacity from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the center currently has only four full-time teachers and one 
part-time teacher. In addition, one of the full-time teachers, Norma Silverman, 
plans to take maternity leave in the next couple of weeks and the Pierce 
administration has thus far refused to hire a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we close a class, we will be illegal in some way," Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers from throughout the community college district attended a district 
Board of Trustees meeting Oct. 3 at Pierce to voice their concerns about budget 
cuts for the child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Simone of East Los Angeles College said the district allotment of $2.3 
million is about $572,000 less than last year's expenditure. "The colleges have 
been left holding the bag," he said. "This bag is empty." 
</P>
<P>
"I would not have the opportunity to be a full-time student if it were not for 
child care," said Barbara Kime, a 28-year-old single parent attending Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers asked the board to adopt a set of guidelines that would, among 
other things, assure that child-care centers with two classrooms have four 
teachers and those with four classrooms have six. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, along with four other district schools, has a four-classroom center. 
The other four schools have two-classroom centers. DAN DOW

ON CAMPUS: COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS;

<P>
PRIVATE FIRM TO RUN BOOKSTORE

<P>
The Santa Clarita Community College District Board of Trustees this week 
approved a three-year contract that will allow a private firm to operate and 
manage the College of the Canyons bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees voted Wednesday night to award Follette College Stores a contract to 
take over the campus store Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The contract guarantees the district $75,000 a year or 7.2% of sales between $1 
million and $1.5 million and 7.6% of sales above $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new management, students will receive reduced book prices. More used 
books, updated technology, additional staff, extended operating hours, internal 
improvements and special promotions also are included in the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
A major concern of college officials was the continued employment of its own 
full-time employees at the bookstore. The company agreed to place the COC 
employees under contract and to offer them full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"They will pay the entire cost of our benefits," said Dianne Van Hook, district 
superintendent-president. "That is an added bonus for us." 
</P>
<P>
A committee of faculty members and students investigated reports of high prices 
at the college-run store for the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees selected Follette College Stores over three competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Lower book prices will not be immediately evident because of inflation, said 
Trustee Linda Cubbage. JACI D. ANTRAM

In response to concerns about recycling, the Cal State Northridge Foundation, 
which runs many of the campus food services, has switched from Styrofoam, a 
non-renewable material, to paper and plastic plates, bowls and cups. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been researching this problem for eight months," said foundation food 
services manager Dean Calvo. "We contacted the company which supplied us with 
the Styrofoam about recycling, but that did not work out." 
</P>
<P>
The paper and plastic items are biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the campus community . . . should be glad to hear of this change," 
he said.

Regarding Robert W. Rae's slanderous remarks about Junior Seau (Oct. 6): I 
talked with Junior when he was in our restaurant just last week. 
</P>
<P>
He is the nicest, most courteous man I have ever met. Even though he was having 
dinner, he took the time to talk with everyone who wanted to talk to him. He 
was quiet, sincere and a pleasure to be around. If Junior is "the biggest jerk" 
or "idiot loudmouth," I'm Saddam Hussein! 
</P>
<P>
As far as his linebacking skills, an oak tree does not grow in a day. Give him 
time. He will be a great one.

TOLLIVER SEEKING ADVICE FROM EXPERIENCED FRIEND

<P>
Charger quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver wants to get a few words of advice from 
his friend John Elway, the Broncos' quarterback, but the timing is never right. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to call him, but he lost against Buffalo, so I didn't," Tolliver 
said. "And then I was going to call him the other night, but they lost against 
Cleveland. Nobody wants to talk about other people's problems after a loss." 
</P>
<P>
These are Tolliver's two biggest problems: The Chargers are 1-4, and he has 
completed only 46.8% of his passes for an average of 5.81 yards per attempt. 
The frustration swells with each loss, each interception and each bad decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win worse than anybody in this organization," he said. "It's 
frustrating as hell when you go out and you don't perform well, or you do 
something that's against what you're taught to do. All I can do is just keep 
working through it." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't this what all inexperienced quarterbacks go through? 
</P>
<P>
"Could be," Tolliver said. "We'll find out when I'm experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Walter Wilson, never one to mince words, isn't planning to let his 
sprained ankle and sore knee prevent him from getting in on Sunday's action 
against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that they better use me," Wilson said. "I ain't coming to watch 
nobody else play, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has been walking around all week with a mile-long Ace bandage wrapped 
around his leg. Coach Dan Henning is a little less sure that Wilson should be 
playing than Wilson is. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be very cautious about putting him in there," Henning said. "He 
hasn't worked in practice, and we've got to be careful. He'll be there for 
emergency purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Chargers are also without wide receiver Nate Lewis (thigh), Quinn 
Early will make his first start since the season opener at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Charger players had the second team meeting in as many days. Nobody 
would say exactly what it was about. 
</P>
<P>
"Team stuff," linebacker Steve Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver didn't attend. He did let on he knew the subject matter, but he chose 
to keep mum. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean I missed a meeting?" he said, grinning. "I was having lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Burt Grossman wasn't exactly doing handstands over his cover 
story in this week's issue of Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
His critique: "It was all right. It kind of repeated a lot of stuff that I'd 
seen already." 
</P>
<P>
Things aren't getting much easier for linebacker Junior Seau, the Chargers' No. 
1 draft pick. His inauspicious NFL debut has been filled with mishaps, and he 
still doesn't think he has a handle on his role. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just barely getting the grasp of it," he said. "You can't feel comfortable 
when you're getting the grasp of things." 
</P>
<P>
Seau says his biggest adjustment is learning how to help the secondary with 
pass coverage, which isn't as much fun as smashing into the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a matter of what I like," he said. "It's just something that's got to 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
Homecomings: 
</P>
<P>
Larry Pasquale, the Chargers' special teams coach, will be making his first 
appearance against the Jets since he defected during the off-season. Pasquale 
was a Jet assistant for 10 seasons. Safety Lester Lyles played for the Jets 
from 1985 to 1987, but this is his second appearance at the Meadowlands since 
leaving. He was back in 1988 as a member of the Phoenix Cardinals. DON

LAID-BACK SAN DIEGO NOT A CITY FOR CHAMPIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As another depressing sports year in San Diego draws to a close, the 
ever-optimistic local sports fan is left to ponder the same old question: Why 
do all of my teams lose? Be it the Aztecs, Padres or Chargers, San Diego sports 
teams can be counted on to disappoint and dishearten even the most loyal sports 
fan. Of course, the one aberration is the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I think I have the answer to this dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is, by nature, a weak, soft, laid-back, silly sort of resort city 
that lacks any real intensity or grit. The teams that represent this city 
manifest these qualities and play accordingly. It doesn't make any difference 
how intense or tough an athlete is when he comes here (San Diego produces few 
of its own athletes) after a few margaritas, some guacamole and a day at the 
beach, they lose their edge. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is not new coaches, free agents, new general managers or new arenas. 
As long as the teams represent San Diego, they can be counted on to play 
accordingly. This fact won't change until the demeanor of the city changes, and 
that won't be happening in the near future.

RESULT OF ANOTHER CONTENDER'S RUN AT NO. 1 TEAM: MORSE 57, KEARNY 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another test of top-ranked Morse's firepower went up in flames Friday when No. 
6 Kearny, playing in front of 3,800 fans at Mesa College, lost to the 
undefeated and still unchallenged Tigers, 57-6. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny, which entered the game 5-0 and averaging over 30 points a game, proved 
one thing in this "big game": it's a long way between No. 6 and No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
And if there were any question as to just how dominant Morse (6-0) was -- the 
Tigers had been averaging 48 points a game -- the answer came after eight 
minutes and 30 seconds. Three possessions, 11 plays and 22-0, Morse. 
</P>
<P>
The game had just started, but Kearny was physically beaten and emotionally 
demoralized. This was not expected. Kearny has a oversized line that goes 
6-feet-6, 6-6, 6-6, 6-4, 6-4 and one of the county's most explosive 
receiver/punt returners in Darnay Scott. But Morse's line, which features no 
one taller than 6-3, pushed the Komets all over the place and chased Scott out 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we put pressure on the quarterback, and we did a good job on Barney 
Scott or whatever that guy's name is," Morse guard/noseguard Salua Poutoa said. 
"They thought the little guys from Morse couldn't hit." 
</P>
<P>
Kearny quarterback Sam Page had Poutoa and others in his face the rest of the 
game as the Komets tried to play catch-up. He threw 18 passes and completed 
only one to Scott. Whenever Scott was able to do something, which wasn't often, 
something bad followed. 
</P>
<P>
With Kearny trailing, 31-6, early in the third quarter, Scott gained 19 yards 
on a reverse. On the next play, Page was blind-sided and threw an interception. 
Scott bolted 35 yards on another reverse, and Page turned the ball again over 
with a fumble on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kearny could not stop quarterback Teddy Lawrence and Morse's 
offense, which poured it on with 26 second-half points. Lawrence put bootlegs, 
play-action passes, option pitches, counter dives and a monkey wrench into 
Kearny's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence scored on runs of 26 and 28 yards, rushing six times for 87 yards. He 
fired a 51-yard strike to Cary Taylor for another score. He even fumbled at the 
line of scrimmage, then scooped up the loose ball as a shortstop would and 
scampered 18 yards to set up the first score. Kearny could do nothing right. 
Morse could do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"They're physical, but I don't think they've seen speed on the field like we 
have," Morse Coach John Shacklett said. "We don't have a bad ballclub." DANA 
HADDAD

MANASSA GETS ROUT OFF TO A QUICK START

<P>
Signs of life appeared in the Point Loma High offense Friday afternoon, and 
they proved to be a sign-off for Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time this season, Point Loma defeated a top-five and 
higher-ranked team by rolling over Mira Mesa, 35-3 at Point Loma High. Mira 
Mesa (4-1) came in ranked No. 2. Point Loma (5-0) was No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Point Loma got by Helix when the Highlanders were No. 2. Before 
that, the Pointers upset then-No. 3 Rancho Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pointers did that with something of a secret-agent offense -- which 
spent most of the time incognito, showing up for only three touchdowns combined 
in both games. 
</P>
<P>
The cloak came off Friday -- and fast. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Manassa took a handoff from Tobin Gault on the first play of the game, 
peeked at the defense, darted outside and 80 yards later crossed the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Manassa deflected credit for the score to his offensive line, particularly 
right guard La'Roi Glover (6-foot-2, 265) and right tackle James Witkowski 
(6-4, 270). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a play based on pure power," Manassa said. "Our two biggest offensive 
linemen just power their men as far downfield as possible and I just choose 
which hole to run through." 
</P>
<P>
Manassa had many holes from which to choose during the afternoon. Her finished 
the half with 187 yards on 14 carries, with three touchdowns. With five 
second-half carries, Manassa finished with 209 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Manassa scored from the three on a fourth-and-two in the second quarter and 
again from the one with 30 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
His second-half touchdown came on a 79-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw how slow and lackadaisical Mira Mesa was chasing the punt," Manassa said 
of Mike Bovee's 56-yarder. "The rule is never back up on punts, but if I backed 
up for this one I knew they weren't going to be up for a return." 
</P>
<P>
So Manassa did back up, caught the ball and saw little coverage. He started 
right, then cut back and strode in. Yes, that easy. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, Manassa was Point Loma's offense. So convinced of this was Mira 
Mesa that its defense went after Manassa on a second-quarter play-action, 
leaving Matt Boxell open in the end zone. Gault hit him with a 17-yard throw. 
</P>
<P>
All this came against the county's No. 1-rated defense. Mira Mesa had allowed 
only 10 points in five games and figured to keep Point Loma's offense in 
hibernation for another week. 
</P>
<P>
Manassa knew otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"When we had a bye last week, the practices were really intense, like we were 
preparing for a Morse game," he said. "As the week went on, we just got 
hungrier and hungrier." 
</P>
<P>
That game against Morse, now ranked No. 1, is two weeks away.

FORT WAYNE SHUTS DOWN THE GULLS 
</P>

<P>
The experience is there. The talent is there. The desire is there. 
</P>
<P>
The goals, for the most part, aren't. 
</P>
<P>
In front of 5,083 Friday, the Gulls dropped a 5-1 International Hockey League 
game to Fort Wayne, giving them their third consecutive loss since an 
opening-night victory Oct. 5 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have the net play, we have to bear down a little more," said Coach 
Mike O'Connell. "We had too many wasted opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego had 33 shots on goal to Fort Wayne's 28, but the missed chances in 
the first period, where the Gulls could connect on just one of 12 chances, came 
back to haunt them. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason we stopped," said O'Connell, emphasizing his team didn't play 
aggressively. "We'd miss opportunities, then they built off that and we 
folded." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls have outshot their opponents in all four games and have scored only 
one even-strength goal in the last 11 periods. 
</P>
<P>
Fort Wayne put the game away in the third period by scoring three times. 
</P>
<P>
Right wing Max Midendorf made it 3-1 when he scored his second goal of the 
night at 7:21 on a wrist shot from the left wing. The shot took a bounce and 
landed at mid-net. 
</P>
<P>
Left wing Bob Lasko, the league's fourth-leading point scorer last year, scored 
on a rebound from the left of the crease at 10:50. 
</P>
<P>
And center Marc Saumier ended the scoring with two seconds remaining, taking it 
in amid a pileup from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
In much the same way the Gulls dominated the first period, Fort Wayne took the 
second by storm. 
</P>
<P>
In rapid-fire succession, the Komets scored two goals, overcoming the Gulls' 
1-0 first-period lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Komets capitalized on two second-period penalties on the Gulls' Larry Floyd 
(tripping) and Steve Dykstra (cross-checking). With a two-man advantage, center 
Bruce Boudreau, who was second overall in points standings in the IHL last 
season, evened it at 1-1 with a slapshot from the slot at 6:15. 
</P>
<P>
Still on the power play 1:14 later, Midendorf freed himself from a pack and 
took a shot from the right corner, making it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Gull left wing Bob Jones scored his first goal on a power play at 3:22, when he 
stationed himself just to the right of the crease and took a pass from 
defenseman Al Tuer high at the left point. The timing was perfect, and Jones 
deflected it to goaltender Steve Laurin's left side and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls outshot Fort Wayne, 12-9, in the first period, but it was Gull goalie 
Scott Brower who made the saves that sent ripples of appreciation through the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Brower, making his second start of the season, stopped breakaway attempts by 
Fort Wayne's Robin Bawa and Bob Lasko and made a lunging pad save in the first 
period. Brower was credited with a loss in the Gulls 2-0 decision Wednesday at 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Gull Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fort Wayne's Al Sims, in his second year as head coach, said it is rough for 
independent teams, ones without primary NHL affiliation, to finish better than 
.500 in the IHL. Fort Wayne and San Diego are two of the five teams in the 
11-team league without primary affiliations. "It's tough for independents," 
Sims said. "They can start off fine, do well in the beginning of the season, 
but they seem to fall by the wayside in January. Let's look at (San Diego's) 
record and see how they're doing in January." Fort Wayne is still one of the 
better teams that goes it alone. The Komets finished second overall in the IHL 
in 1987-88. "They are consistently the best of the independents," IHL spokesman 
Mike Meyers said. . . . They'll never pass this way again: Friday was the one 
night of the season the Gulls showed off their visiting black jerseys at home. 
Just as well, the names are much harder to read. . . . Face in the Town: Gull 
right wing Brent Sapergia is missing a few front teeth. What do you expect from 
someone whose hometown is Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. . . . Attendance watch: 
After three home dates, the Gulls' attendance average is 6,761.

Air show enthusiasts and plane buffs can catch a glimpse of wing walkers, 
parachutists, aerobatic gliders and hangars full of planes at the Pacific 
Missile Test Center this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial stunts will be performed today and Sunday between 12:30 and 4 p.m. at 
the Point Mugu Air Show, with live entertainment during the morning beginning 
at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Air show organizers expect about 55,000 people each day, Cmdr. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
The show, in its 28th year, will feature stunt men and women from Southern 
California and across the country. One local performer, Joanna Osterud of 
Oxnard, will perform loops in a new biplane this year, center spokesman Bob 
Hubbert said. The Sierra Aces, based in Santa Monica, and the Skylark North 
Aerobatic Team, based in Tehachapi, also will perform, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The air show offers the community a chance to see the base at Point Mugu, which 
is normally closed to the public, Okamoto said. "It's a community relations 
event to show the taxpayers what we're doing with their dollars," he said.

FIRE PREVENTION DAY RECALLS CHICAGO FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Fire Department will hold its annual fire prevention day, in 
remembrance of the disastrous 1871 Chicago fire, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today 
at the Buenaventura Mall parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
While the public will have the opportunity to see various pieces of fire 
equipment, a more important element is the development of familiarity with the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we always hear is how afraid people are to call 911," said Barry 
Simmons, the department's public education officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire prevention day helps to shorten the distance between the Fire Department 
and the public. It makes people feel free to call us up and say, 'I need help. 
My kids are playing with fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the equipment display, Simmons will instruct youngsters on how 
to "stop, drop and roll" if their clothing catches on fire. They will also be 
taught to crawl toward an exit in a smoke-filled room. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons will also give instruction on smoke detectors. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

BANK ROBBED FOR 2ND TIME IN 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard bank was robbed for the second time in two days on Friday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A man robbed the Wells Fargo Bank at 460 Esplanade Drive in Oxnard at 1:50 p.m. 
and escaped on a bicycle -- but not before a red-dye packet that clings to 
clothes and skin exploded on him, said Gary Auer, agent in charge of the FBI's 
Ventura County office. 
</P>
<P>
After the man asked the teller for money, he was given a red-dye packet with 
the cash. After he left the bank, the dye packet exploded, giving off smoke and 
gas, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told authorities that they last saw the man peddling through a large 
parking structure with a stream of red smoke trailing after him. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials believe this is the first bank the man has robbed in the area. He 
was described as a white man in his mid-20s, about 5 feet, 6 inches tall with a 
slim build and blond hair. He was wearing a light blue striped shirt and light 
blue denim pants. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a man suspected of nine county bank robberies and one attempted 
robbery robbed the Oxnard Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, a dye packet exploded and the robber was chased into the street, 
Auer said. The man fled into a housing complex. Undercover police agents staked 
out the area and arrested an Oxnard man about two hours later, Lt. Stan Myers 
of the Oxnard Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Villareal, 19, was being held on suspicion of bank robbery and for 
outstanding misdemeanor warrants, a jail spokesman said. Villareal is also 
believed to be responsible for a bank robbery in the San Fernando Valley, Auer 
said. CAROL WATSON

OLDER PAINTERS EXHIBIT ARTWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Camarillo artists is out to prove that you are never too old to set 
up an easel, stretch out a canvas and pick up a paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, members of the Leisure Village painters club ranging in age from 
70 to 90, are exhibiting their work today and Sunday at the Irene Vasquez Art 
Center in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings were done by the club's professional, semi-professional and very 
enthusiastic amateurs, said Marian Jayne, president of the club and its 
part-time art teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've exhibited outside Leisure Village. We want to 
show what can be done at any age," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 59 paintings exhibited are done in oil, but there are some acrylics 
and watercolors, Jayne said. Subject matter includes landscapes, abstracts, 
still lifes and "of course, we always have portraits of the grandchildren or 
the cat." 
</P>
<P>
Jayne, a 76-year-old retired professional artist with several works in the 
show, said the exhibit also provides the first opportunity for some of her 
beginning students to showcase their efforts. 
</P>

2 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO ANIMAL NEGLECT

<TEXT>
<P>
Alfred (Dale) Beem and his son, Robert, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor 
animal-neglect charges during their arraignment Friday in Ventura Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
A trial is scheduled for Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were originally charged with felony animal abuse when seven horses, 
69 rabbits and 35 sheep were impounded from their rented ranch on Piru Canyon 
Road in an unincorporated section of the county May 31. Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark 
Pachowicz said the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor due to extenuating 
circumstances, including the fact that the two men had to care for the animals 
alone after Beem's wife and his younger son Michael left Piru to care for 
ailing relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced charge does not lessen the severity of neglect to the animals.

FREEWAY FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am furious. We vote for a large increase in our gasoline taxes and then find 
that we in Ventura County are at the bottom of the list. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Paula Freeway is one of the most dangerous roads in the state, yet we 
are told that "action can not be taken overnight on something like this." Where 
have these state transportation commissioners been for the last 10 to 15 years 
when people have been killed on this road? 
</P>
<P>
The freeway could be widened for a fraction of the cost of some of these 
freeway projects, but I have a feeling the commissioners have tunnel vision. 
They only see what they want to see.

2 RIVALS AGREE MORE THAN DISAGREE

Although the purpose of the forum was to accentuate their differences, Ventura 
County supervisor candidates Bill Davis and Vicky Howard found Friday night 
that they agreed more than they disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates, speaking at a forum at the Simi Valley Council Chambers, 
opposed a regional government to oversee Southern California counties. And both 
opposed the proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric because they believe that Edison would expand operations at its 
two Oxnard plants, resulting in increased pollution in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The two candidates also said they do not believe an adequate site exists in 
Ventura County for a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all in Ventura County would like to have a commercial airport," 
Davis said. "The problem is where to put it. I think I would probably say 
Palmdale is the best answer . . . You could provide quick rail service or bus 
service to it. I think that is probably going to be the best Ventura County can 
do." Palmdale is in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Both also opposed proposed pay raises for Ventura County supervisors, who now 
make about $45,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates did offer differing views on transportation. Howard said the 
county needs to push hard to have California 118 and the Moorpark Freeway 
widened. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, on the other hand, suggested that the county and officials from its 10 
cities work to devise a master transportation plan to create an interconnecting 
bus service between all cities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis emerged from a field of five candidates in the June primary to 
qualify for a runoff in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who received 25.4% of the vote in the primary to Howard's 36.9%, said in 
a recent interview that he is confident he has closed the gap. One indication 
that his support is growing, he said, is the fact that he has been able to 
raise and spend about $10,000 more on his campaign than Howard during the past 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're running neck and neck right now," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard has maintained that her experience gives her an edge in the race. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her eight years on the City Council, Howard serves as the city's 
representative on the County Transportation Commission and as a member of the 
Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Howard who recommended Davis for a seat on the city's 
Planning Commission in 1985 and supported his appointment to the City Council 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although Davis has acknowledged a debt to Howard for getting him involved in 
politics, he said he is by no means her protege. 
</P>
<P>
While serving on the council Davis said he helped establish a rent subsidy 
program for low-income seniors and co-authored a voter-approved measure that 
amended the city's slow-growth ordinance to allow more development of 
affordable housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County League of Women Voters sponsored the forum. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Clara 
Valley. Terms run for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Current 4th District Supervisor James R. Dougherty announced earlier this year 
that he would not seek reelection.

EARTHQUAKE DRILL PLEASES AGENCIES

<P>
In a realistic training drill, county emergency workers responded to a 5.0 
earthquake that would have damaged Casitas Dam south of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
It would have taken officials 1 1/2 hours to begin evacuations after the quake 
damaged the earthen dam, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But they were happy with the agencies' response. 
</P>
<P>
"We were real pleased. It went real well," said Wendy Haddock, program manager 
with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
A moderate earthquake was simulated instead of a large one, she said, to allow 
agency coordination at a time when no other damage in the county would have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In the drill, the dam was damaged but held after the imaginary quake, the 
epicenter of which was along the Red Mountain fault that runs under the dam. 
</P>
<P>
The training exercise was undertaken Sept. 27 by the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department office of emergency services after three months of planning. Casitas 
Municipal Water District, which operates the earthen dam, released a report on 
the exercise this week. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario had the quake occurring at 7 a.m. on a Thursday. Participants such 
as the Red Cross, California Highway Patrol and the county superintendent of 
schools were given no warning of when the drill was to take place. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 a.m., Casitas staff reported that the dam had been damaged but was 
holding. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuation of about 3,000 residents below the dam was recommended as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
The dam's main outlet was damaged in the scenario, which would have left the 
city of Ventura without its 9,000-acre-foot water supply from the lake. 
</P>
<P>
If the dam completely fails, about 12,000 residents would be in the inundation 
path along Ventura River to the ocean, Haddock said. THIA BELL

<TEXT>
<P>
Charting improvements in the San Diego Symphony under the tutelage of new music 
director Yoav Talmi could become a pleasant pastime. Although it would be 
foolish to expect overnight miracles -- and Talmi would be the first to dismiss 
such a lightheaded notion -- the orchestra's Thursday night concert at Copley 
Symphony Hall displayed some hopeful signs. 
</P>
<P>
Haydn's Symphony No. 96 ("The Miracle"), the program's opening salvo, sparkled 
with unexpected excitement and allure. Haydn has never been a staple of the 
local orchestra, and when programmed, his music has sounded dutiful at best. 
Talmi's approach to this paragon of classical style was animated but unhurried, 
relaxed yet graceful. This took some of the brittle edge off the violin sound, 
bringing it closer to that warm, burnished string timbre characteristic of the 
Viennese school. In the brisk tempos, of course, the violins tended to revert 
to their wonted stridency, but refurbishing this section of the orchestra is a 
long-term project, and every step along the way deserves encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
In the Haydn, Talmi elicited a clean ensemble from the orchestra, whose size he 
had appropriately pared down in the lower string sections. Only the woodwinds 
gave the conductor precisely what he asked for in terms of deftly detailed and 
buoyant phrasing, but the overall result was still refreshingly stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Guest violinist Zina Schiff made a stunning case for Samuel Barber's Violin 
Concerto, mating her sweetly brilliant tone with the work's effusive lyricism. 
Schiff elegantly sprinted through the concerto's broadly arched themes with 
apparent ease, although her sound lacked a certain muscle when pitted against 
the full orchestra. If Schiff and the orchestra turned the slow movement into a 
passionate rhapsody, they lost some of their focus in the breakneck virtuoso 
requirements of the presto finale. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi closed the program with Elgar's familiar "Enigma" Variations, the sort of 
grandiloquent full-orchestra essay that easily showcases the symphony's strong 
points. Indeed, the brass sections did not disappoint Thursday night, bringing 
their well-tempered majesty to bear on Elgar's Victorian largess. Maintaining 
the work's overall architecture was Talmi's primary goal. Not one to gild the 
lily, Talmi found time to indulge the work's darker moments, thoughtfully 
saving the musical climax for the final variation.

KEY KOHL AIDE SHOT AT RALLY; SUSPECT HELD

<P>
A gunman opened fire on Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble at a campaign 
rally Friday, seriously wounding one of Germany's most prominent political 
figures, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, key negotiator of the treaty reunifying East and West Germany and 
one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's closest associates, was shot in the head and 
throat before police overpowered the assailant. A bodyguard also was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
No motive has been determined for the attack against the 48-year-old Cabinet 
member, but "it does not appear to have any terrorist links," said Werner 
Fischer, spokesman for district police in Freiburg, Germany. The Interior 
Ministry also ruled out terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third assassination attempt against a prominent German politician in 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the gunman pulled out a revolver and fired three or four shots as 
Schaeuble was leaving the hall in Oppenau, in southern Germany, shortly after 
10 p.m. A 37-year-old man was arrested at the rally. His name was not released, 
but he was described as a local resident. German media reported the suspect had 
ties to the drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry kept a tight lid on details about the attack but 
confirmed that there appeared to be only one assailant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear yet how far away the gunman was standing from Schaeuble, and we 
don't know whether he said anything before he started shooting," Fischer said. 
He said he was unaware of any threats against Schaeuble's life before the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, the country's top law enforcement official, was the third German 
politician to survive an assassination attempt since April, when chancellor 
candidate Oskar Lafontaine was stabbed in the throat by a deranged woman who 
hid a butcher knife in a bouquet at a campaign rally. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble's own top anti-terrorism expert, Hans Neusel, escaped a bomb planted 
in his car by leftist Red Army Faction guerrillas in July. Neusel suffered only 
a cut hand. 
</P>
<P>
Married and the father of four children, Schaeuble had been viewed as a highly 
competent but somewhat anonymous political figure until his move to the 
Interior Ministry last year catapulted him into the spotlight of European 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
Within just months of taking office in April, 1989, Schaeuble found himself the 
key figure in negotiating the German unification treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly he steered the delicate, emotionally charged talks away from 
potential danger as Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher 
concentrated on the international negotiations that would give Germany back its 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
When East Germans balked at losing their own liberal abortion laws to West 
Germany's highly restrictive ones, Schaeuble helped fashion the compromise that 
allowed both pieces of legislation to remain in force until a new law can be 
agreed upon for the united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, not Kohl, represented West Germany when the treaty between the two 
states was signed in August. 
</P>
<P>
And when the treaty threatened to unravel before it was ratified, Schaeuble 
again coolly stepped in and worked out a compromise over the controversial 
issue of who would get control of the massive files compiled by East Germany's 
hated secret police. 
</P>
<P>
The files remain in the eastern part of the country, a concession to protesters 
who feared West German security officials might try to use the information they 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
Personable and outgoing, Schaeuble's performance in recent months has made 
political analysts here consider him a potential star of the next generation of 
German leadership, possibly one day succeeding Kohl as chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl is considered a shoo-in for reelection when the newly united country votes 
Dec. 2. Schaeuble was stumping for their party in Oppenau, in Baden 
Wurttemberg, when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
The British news agency Reuters reported that Hans-Peter Junker, a journalist 
who witnessed the shooting, told German television that Schaeuble had just 
given a talk to a group of about 300 on German unity and was leaving to 
enthusiastic applause when the shots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before the door, a man jumped up from a table on the left, jumped past 
the security men and fired at him," Junker said. Bystanders overpowered the 
attacker, while security men went to Schaeuble's aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Schaeuble was bleeding very heavily, but he remained conscious and spoke," 
Junker said. 
</P>
<P>
The minister's daughter witnessed the shooting. "His daughter couldn't grasp 
what was happening; she screamed and began to cry," Junker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Schaeuble was Kohl's right-hand man before he came to the Interior Ministry, 
but it was a kind of gray eminence," commented one Western diplomat who has 
followed Schaeuble's career closely. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one was surprised that he rose to the challenge as he has done," he 
added. "He's had enormous responsibility during the unity process, but he's 
proved to be an extremely capable figure." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the lone incidents in the unity process that drew criticism 
of Schaeuble was a dramatic security lapse in Berlin on unification day, Oct. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, an emotionally disturbed man managed to slip through security checks 
at the Berlin Philharmonic, where Kohl, German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and other dignitaries were sitting. The man casually strolled to 
the podium and spoke for three minutes before security officials seized him and 
took him away. 
</P>
<P>
Political opponents demanded Schaeuble's resignation after the incident, but 
there was no indication that Kohl considered asking the interior minister to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble entered Parliament in 1972 and was a chancellery minister from 1984 
to 1989.

ACERRA, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bishop of Acerra is a spare, courageous and endangered man who lives in a 
neighborhood where festering scars from a 1980 earthquake mirror the 
degradation of his flock. 
</P>
<P>
Two churches face one another across Acerra's main piazza. One is a fissured 
ruin. The other, the cathedral, is protected by a fence. Between them, grimy 
street kids play soccer. Many are illiterate, and some are already accomplished 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys talk admiringly about gang leaders the way we might talk about John 
Kennedy -- how many bodyguards he's got, how many machine guns," said Bishop 
Antonio Riboldi. 
</P>
<P>
In a poor and desperate part of Italy that one senior official from Rome has 
publicly termed "an unlivable monster," Riboldi said it is past time to stop 
the rot. "Fear is no longer a good enough excuse. Whoever does not denounce 
lawlessness becomes its accomplice." 
</P>
<P>
Acerra, a slum of 50,000, lies in the decayed hinterland of Naples, spawning 
ground -- and killing ground -- of La Camorra, one of the three branches of the 
organized crime cartel that loots a nation unable to control it. 
</P>
<P>
While Italy celebrates a robust First World economy and the current presidency 
of the European Community, its children are bleeding, victims of an atavistic 
underworld that transcends frontiers of time and morality. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of accelerating gangland savagery here in the Italian south, 
the bishop's pain is echoed in a national outcry: Basta -- Enough! There are 
new anti-crime programs and promises aplenty. But, as ever, the bad guys are 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
For many Italians, the crisis is not simply one of crime, or even of violence. 
On trial, they say, are the rule of law, and national values. 
</P>
<P>
Designer-dressed Italy has never been richer or more democratic, but in some 
parts of its south the state's writ ends abruptly at the borders of shoot-first 
gangland fiefdoms. Fully one-quarter of the children of Acerra are not enrolled 
in school, and nearly half of all young people can find no honest work, their 
bishop says. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that there are places in Italy where the presence, or at least the 
functioning, of state institutions has become enfeebled," laments President 
Francesco Cossiga. 
</P>
<P>
La Camorra, like its outlaw kin, the Mafia in Sicily and the 'Ndrangheta in 
Calabria, is ruthless and relentless, but even Neapolitans inured to its 
predations are stunned by a current anarchic struggle for power in which 
gangland recruits, like their prey, are ever younger. 
</P>
<P>
"Baby killers," the Italian press calls them, using the English words. A 
15-year-old murdered a 12-year-old witness to a Camorra execution attempt one 
day last month. One shot to the back of the neck killed Andrea Esposito. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, 8-year-old Paolo Longobardi, who happened to be home 
when Camorra killers came for his father, also died of bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"They are beasts, no more than wild animals," said Naples Police Chief Vito 
Mattera. 
</P>
<P>
The Mafia and the 'Ndrangheta have been settling accounts as well this fall: an 
anti-Mafia judge murdered in Agrigento, Sicily; broad swaths of Calabria 
terrorized by one-a-day 'Ndrangheta killers. In Calabria, 9-year-old Elisabetta 
Gagliardi died instantly last month, an incidental casualty of her mother's 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
By tradition, Italy is not a violent country: There will be fewer homicides 
among the 60 million Italians this year than in the 14 1/2 million of New York 
City. In the world of organized crime, though, violence is an appalling staple. 
Of 1,055 homicides in Italy through the first eight months of this year, there 
were 250 in Sicily, 213 in Calabria, and 209 in the Campania region headed by 
Naples. 
</P>
<P>
"That there are zones of Italy presided over by the Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta 
and the Mafia is true, but it is also true that there are police there as well, 
good police. But we alone are not the state," said Matteo Cinque, chief of 
criminal police for the Campania region. 
</P>
<P>
Counterattacking, the government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti promises 
more money, more police, a toughened and streamlined justice system, more and 
better-protected judges, stricter gun laws and tighter fiscal control on 
municipalities where gangland infiltration is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
But Italians such as Calabrian farmer Carlo de Biaso, whose orchard was 
decimated by vandals after he refused to pay protection money, have heard it 
all before. 
</P>
<P>
In the belt of despair around Naples, where 2 million people live amid some of 
Italy's most grinding poverty, there is a pathetic procession of slum towns 
where elected officials are beholden to the Camorra. Nominal members of Italian 
political parties, they are in fact elected on the Camorra ticket. 
</P>
<P>
In Calabria, seven women judges, impartial outsiders, were named with great 
fanfare last March to help fight crime in the besieged town of Locri. One never 
went, and four of the remaining six are asking for transfers back north. 
</P>
<P>
Locri is no fun: Somebody blew up the town hall not long ago, and last month an 
outdoor platform mysteriously burned down before a scheduled anti-crime rally. 
One senior police official was murdered, and the present carabinieri commander 
can't find baby sitters for his young children -- too dangerous, say local 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
Specializing in kidnaping and extortion, the 'Ndrangheta is a network of clans 
based on large families, 152 by recent police count, with 5,200 members and 
15,000 "friends." About 80% of all crimes of violence in the Calabria region 
over the last 18 months have occurred in Locri and the 105 other towns in 
Reggio Calabria province. In the more than 200 'Ndrangheta murders in Calabria 
this year, there has not been a single arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In Sicily, where the centrally controlled Cosa Nostra is Italy's largest, 
richest and best-known criminal enterprise, investigators seemed to be making 
headway in 1987 when testimony from renegade members helped bring hundreds of 
Mafia bosses and soldiers to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, though, justice has stumbled badly. Judges began to fight among 
themselves. Killings were unanswered by arrests. Momentum shifted back to the 
Mafia, richly astride a vast, multinational empire of legal and illegal 
businesses. Flush with profits from heroin, the Mafia kills and intimidates 
selectively in Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mafia killers assassinated Magistrate Rosario Livantino, 38, in 
Agrigento, and parked a car with 120 pounds of explosives outside the police 
headquarters in Catania where there had been a series of annoying arrests. More 
polished than its colleagues in Calabria or Campania, the Sicilian mob 
delivered its message not by exploding the car but by calling a television 
station to warn of its cargo. 
</P>
<P>
"Mafia culture is worse than Hitler's doctrine," said Agrigento Archbishop 
Carmelo Ferraro in the funeral oration for the slain magistrate. "They call it 
honor, but it is clothed in contempt, ferocity, betrayal. By the fruits you 
shall know the tree. It's time to remind ourselves that there is no room for 
compromise and delay. Society and democracy cannot be supported by arrogant 
tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
Once, "men of honor," as gang members like to be known, made a point of keeping 
women, children and bystanders well away from their fights with one another and 
the lagging law. That has changed, just as in current Italian parlance, the 
term "Mafia" that was once reserved for the Sicilian mob is now also used 
generically to describe Italian organized crime in all of its violent and 
increasingly intertwined guises. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Mafia specialist Pino Arlacchi said there is considerable 
interconnection among the three, once largely self-contained regional crime 
enterprises. "It's all just organized crime now -- the Mafia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi and other observers blame Italy's swelling violence on the changing 
nature of organized crime. In less hectic times, clans or families were static, 
operating in established and respected territories. Everybody knew who was who 
and who was where. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," said Arlacchi, "the clans compete actively for new business, rubbing up 
against one another in the marketplace as they jostle for contracts, rackets 
and new territory. The violence is a function of the new nature of their 
business. What is new is the number of women and children victims. They are a 
function of the growing level of violence." 
</P>
<P>
In Campania now, as many as 80 different Camorra clans are battling for space 
and prominence, as fierce as rats vying for bits of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The most diffuse and least organized of Italy's criminal big three, La Camorra 
lives off cocaine, contraband, numbers and extortion. After a prosperous decade 
in which billions of dollars in largely ineffective Italian government 
earthquake aid wound up in criminal pockets, times are leaner now in Campania. 
Lacking any overall, Sicilian-style leadership, rival Camorra clans that got 
rich when the going was good are now slugging it out. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Sicilian) Mafia shoots high, the Camorra shoots low," said Police Chief 
Cinque, meaning that in Sicily, Mafia victims are often carefully targeted 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Around Naples, Camorra clans war from city hall to neighborhood soccer fields. 
Police at first thought Andrea Esposito, the 12-year-old working in a bar, had 
been killed because he happened to witness a Camorra murder there. Only later 
did it become clear that he was the intended victim of a blood feud between 
clans. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the children of the Campania region fail to finish primary 
school, according to Marcello d'Orta, a teacher who has written a best-seller 
about the violent fears and dreams of Naples' children. 
</P>
<P>
The street kids are abundant and eager kindling for Camorra recruiters. Judge 
Melita Cavallo says the defendants in her Naples juvenile court keep getting 
younger. Not long ago, she said, an 8-year-old was brought to court who had 
long and savvy experience as a lookout during robberies committed by his 
mother's lover. 
</P>
<P>
For the children, crime means freedom, money and respect. For the Camorra, 
children are perfect foils. They are easy to impress, they work cheap, their 
blood is hot and, under Italy's liberal laws, it is almost impossible to 
incarcerate them. An adult cocaine courier might go to jail, but a child 
courier is certain to go home. D'Orta recalls one 14-year-old gunman arrested 
on three different occasions with three different pistols -- and driven home by 
police each time. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I could send a child to a reformatory for one year for a purse 
snatching. Then it was three months. Now it is a suspended sentence and send 
them home," said Cavallo. 
</P>
<P>
Riboldi, an outspoken prelate who has been threatened more than once by the 
Camorra, has seen the transformation of children into hardened criminals within 
a few years. They start by carrying messages for criminal bosses who distrust 
the phones. Then they move upward, one step at a time: numbers running, 
muggings, robberies, holdups, drug trafficking, and even killing. 
</P>
<P>
"I have met 12-year-olds as tough as Camorra bosses," said the bishop of 
Acerra. 
</P>
<P>
By now, it is no secret to anyone in Italy that the Camorra's adopted children 
have been failed by their families, their schools and their national 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't put some pressure on families and on schools, the Mafia will never 
be conquered," said President Cossiga while Naples teachers complained of a 
shortage of benches and books, blackboards and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for concerned Italians in the front line, such lofty musings sound like 
another chorus of an old song, too long whistled on the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"At the public level there is no will and no capacity to confront the problem," 
said Judge Cavallo, who left court one day recently anguished by the case of a 
16-year-old caught trying to steal a motorbike with a toy pistol in a trembling 
hand. It seems the boy's mother had worked an extra job and forsworn vacation 
to buy her son a motorbike. Three times she bought one. All three were stolen 
by the Camorra's children.

TERM LIMITS WOULD OUST LAWMAKERS AND A SYSTEM

<P>
Tapping a wellspring of public antipathy to the institutions of government, 
backers of two November ballot measures that would limit terms of officeholders 
appear on the verge of transforming the face of California politics as few have 
done before. 
</P>
<P>
If either Proposition 131 or 140 is approved -- and polls show both leading by 
wide margins -- state lawmakers, the governor and other state elected officials 
will for the first time face limits on their tenure in office. The result, say 
the initiatives' sponsors, is the Legislature's entrenched leadership 
ultimately will be swept from office and "lifetime politicians" will be 
replaced by "citizen-legislators." 
</P>
<P>
Critics don't argue with the popular appeal of the measures' anti-incumbent 
message. But they foresee a far different outcome: A Legislature with few real 
experts, where lawmakers are even more obsessed with moving up and few have the 
experience and political savvy to resist lobbyists and the empire building of 
career bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
The term limits would result in the biggest upheaval in electoral politics in 
the state since 1966, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark one-man, one-vote 
decision was implemented. With that ruling, large-population counties received 
proportionately more representation in the Legislature, bringing in 22 new 
senators, a majority of the 40-member Senate, and 33 new lawmakers to the 
80-member Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The move toward term limits also reflects more widespread political unrest, 
spawned by a common message that is being delivered to incumbent officeholders: 
Serve out the limit and move on. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood is real simple," said blunt-talking Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum, chief sponsor of Proposition 140. "And that is the folks are 
really ticked or fed up -- call it what you will -- over how legislative bodies 
are conducting themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140 would limit lifetime service in the Assembly to six years, in 
the Senate to eight; Proposition 131 would force members of each house to move 
on after 12 consecutive years. Both measures limit most statewide elected 
officials to eight years in office, but Proposition 131 would allow them to run 
again after sitting out a term. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Proposition 131 would provide partial public funding of all state 
political campaigns, paid for out of a taxpayer-supported campaign fund. It 
imposes limits on campaign contributions and expenditures, bans off-year 
campaign fund raising, and establishes a special prosecutor's office to pursue 
public corruption cases. Proposition 140 would slash the Legislature's 
operating budget in half, forcing massive staff lay-offs, and would eliminate 
the legislators' retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
Should both initiatives pass, term limits would be set by the one getting more 
votes, but all the other provisions of both ballot measures would go into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the two constitutional amendments say the measures represent a 
kind of coup d'etat by initiative -- a flagrant attack on basic democracy that 
denies voters the right to keep returning to office the most experienced and 
effective politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Term limits are a come-on for another agenda," said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for 
the No on 131 and 140 campaign. "In the case of 131 it's clearly campaign 
financing. In the case of 140, it's to turn back the clock 25 years to a time 
when the Legislature was totally dependent on special interests and government 
bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
Some view passage of either measure as a major step in a movement -- begun in 
Oklahoma last month -- to impose term limits on legislators in all 50 states, 
and eventually on members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a national movement and we're the big banana," said Senate President 
Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), a bitter foe of both ballot measures 
-- and one of a number of mid-term senators who would be forced from office in 
1996 if Proposition 140 prevails. 
</P>
<P>
In what is proving to be a roaring battle over term limits, both sides in the 
debate agree that either of the measures would change fundamentally the way 
politics is conducted in the nation's most populous state. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 140, with its shorter term limits, 83% of the politicians who 
take seats in the Assembly and Senate later this year would be swept from 
office by 1996. By 1998, 100% of the legislators would be unseated. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wild," said Eugene C. Lee, professor emeritus in political science 
at UC Berkeley. "The consequences are unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Under both measures, the governor, attorney general and most other 
constitutional officers would be held to the eight-year limits -- guaranteeing 
that no one who wins one of the major offices Nov. 6 would be able to serve 
continuously past 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both measures reach for a broom when groping for a symbol of 
their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
The two ballot initiatives have brought together a curious coalition of forces. 
They are of the right and of the left; laissez-faire conservatives and 
environmental activists; those who want more government regulation and those 
who believe that government has intruded far too much. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 131 was crafted by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a liberal 
Democrat, as part of his unsuccessful campaign to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, the best-known author of Proposition 140, is a conservative 
Republican. Sensing a groundswell of frustration with the Legislature, 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson has also endorsed the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Los Angeles Times Poll found strong support for both term-limit 
initiatives and deep frustration with how the state Legislature is handling its 
job. However, most voters with an opinion said their own legislators deserve to 
be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
The September poll showed 55% of voters supporting Schabarum's Proposition 140 
and 28% in opposition. Proposition 131 was only slightly less popular, with 50% 
saying they would vote for the initiative, 34% against it. Other polls have 
shown even stronger support for the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilson, Schabarum and Van de Kamp are veteran politicians, supporters 
of the initiatives for the most part are frustrated outsiders trying to crash a 
political system that they view as unresponsive. Their common view is that 
incumbents have all the advantages when challenged at the polls and that it has 
become increasingly difficult to oust them. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that the term-limit question might have been avoided 
entirely if earlier attempts to change the way legislative districts are 
determined through reapportionment had been successful, opening the way for 
more competitive legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense of frustration that nothing else has worked," said former 
Assembly Speaker Bob Monagan (R-Tracy). He said the efforts of "entrenched 
incumbents not to do anything about reapportionment" were at least partly 
responsible for strong support for term limits. 
</P>
<P>
There is so little competition in legislative races that in the past three 
general and primary elections, from 1984 through 1988, only five incumbent 
legislators were defeated at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
In 15 out of 100 races for state Senate and Assembly this year, incumbents have 
no major party challengers and are virtually certain of reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all of that, opponents of term limits argue that the natural rate of 
turnover is quite high. Nineteen of 40 state senators in office after the 1980 
election have since left the Senate; 41 out of 80 Assembly members are no 
longer in the Assembly. Put another way, exactly half of the 120 lawmakers 
remain in the same jobs a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the top legislative leaders in both parties rank high in 
length of service, headed by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) 
with 26 years in the Assembly and Roberti, who has served 19 years in the 
Senate. Both have remained in office well beyond the average -- just under 11 
years in the Senate and nearly eight years in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Brown and Roberti, along with Assembly Republican Leader Ross 
Johnson of La Habra and Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, are publicly 
committed to defeating the term-limit initiatives -- arguing vociferously that 
without experienced legislators to lead the Senate and the Assembly, the 
Legislature would soon be dominated by the governor, executive branch 
bureaucrats and lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown has been actively and openly raising funds for what is expected 
to be a difficult and expensive campaign, his aides have recently been 
counseling a low profile on the campaign trail, conceding that many voters tend 
to focus their frustrations with the Legislature on the Speaker and his allies. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has been more active than any of the others in raising money to defeat 
the initiative. As proponents of the two measures are quick to point out, the 
Democratic Speaker has turned to special-interest groups to pay for the 
opposition campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's initiative campaign committee reported raising $982,489 in the last 
three months -- receiving most of the money from corporations, unions and 
political action committees representing groups that regularly lobby the 
Legislature. Among the largest contributors were the California Teachers Assn., 
$40,000; RJR Nabisco, $25,000, and the California Beer and Wine Wholesalers, 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of both measures make it clear that legislative leaders are their 
target. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point there is a tiny oligarchy running the show," said California 
Common Cause director Jim Wheaton, now on leave to run the Yes on 131 campaign. 
"The people who are left out are people who care about people or causes but 
don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
One of the main sponsors of Proposition 140, Lewis K. Uhler, is president of 
the National Tax Limitation Committee -- a group seeking a constitutional 
amendment to balance the federal budget. Uhler has attacked the Democratic 
leadership of the Legislature, people he regards as big spenders. He believes 
that faster turnover in the Legislature would improve the chances for "our kind 
of people" -- conservative legislators willing to cut government spending. 
</P>
<P>
With passage of either measure, California would join 26 other states that now 
limit the terms governors may serve, as well as the many states that also place 
limits on other statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
Since statehood 140 years ago, only one California governor has ever been 
elected three times -- Republican Earl Warren, who left in the middle of his 
final term to become chief justice of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But other constitutional officers have had more staying power, including 
several in this century who managed to hold on to their elected jobs until they 
died in office. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the debate over the term limits, especially as they apply to 
the Legislature, is who would be in charge once the new limits take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that the effect would be to force out of office many of the 
most effective legislators -- seasoned lawmakers who are so well entrenched 
that they can stand up to special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen Willie Brown close down those interests," said one Democratic 
legislative staffer. "I've heard him say, in effect, 'I'm more powerful than 
you are. So, no way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brown himself, at a press briefing two months ago, contended that inexperienced 
legislators would be easy prey for lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that in this one, the sleazy, cold-blooded special interests are 
going to see an opportunity and they're going to be supporting (the Schabarum 
initiative) because, believe me, they will dominate, they will dominate," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same session, Brown asked reporters: "Would you prefer to be 
administered for your brain tumor by the surgeon who graduated this year, or by 
the surgeon who has been practicing for 10 years and never lost a patient?" 
</P>
<P>
Consumer activist Ralph Nader, who is campaigning around the state in support 
of Proposition 131, insists that a new crop of legislators would not be 
hampered by their inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is one job you can learn fast, it is the job of being legislator if 
you have the people's interests in mind," Nader said. "If you're going to 
balance all kinds of special interests and deal in that kind of intrigue, it 
does take a while to learn the trade." 
</P>
<P>
While proponents of one initiative are sometimes critical of the other, for the 
most part both camps are saving their harshest rhetoric for the Legislature 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
They recite a similar litany of problems besetting California government: this 
year's lengthy budget impasse, a widening Capitol corruption scandal that has 
already led to the conviction of two former state senators, and an inability to 
settle important issues facing the state, such as rising insurance rates and 
increasing traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Although they accuse the legislative leadership -- and in particular Brown -- 
of kowtowing to the special interests, the chief backers of both term-limit 
initiatives insist that the Speaker is not their target. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not stating here that there are a lot of evil people in Sacramento," 
said San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery, one of the organizers of the Yes on 131 
effort. "What we're saying is that there are people who have turned into 
rascals. They are really kind of caught in the system, where money is the 
end-all of everything." 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of Propositions 131 and 140 have attempted to capitalize on what 
they see as widespread distrust of Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wheaton of the Yes on 131 campaign has attacked Brown as "king of the 
special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, backers of Proposition 140 ask in a campaign brochure, above a 
picture of Brown at the Assembly rostrum, "Should this Speaker of the State 
Assembly have the power to directly affect the lives, the property and the 
financial security of every Californian?" 
</P>
<P>
As Speaker of the Assembly, Brown is the most powerful member of the 
Legislature, able to appoint the committees that can determine the fate of any 
piece of legislation. Because of the power of the office, speakers have 
traditionally been the Legislature's top fund-raisers and the principal 
spokesmen for the majority party in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
In Brown's case, his flamboyant style and quick, sometimes biting wit have made 
him an especially attractive target for critics of the Legislature. For now, 
his aides say, Brown's best way of fighting back is to remain in the background 
if he wants to succeed in preserving the Legislature as he knows it.

WHOLESALE PRICES RISE 1.6% IN SEPTEMBER, FUELED BY OIL COSTS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: TWO-MONTH SURGE IN THE PRODUCERS' INDEX IS THE BIGGEST SINCE 1980. 
INFLATION PACE MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THE FED WILL TRY TO CUT INTEREST RATES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fueled by sharp increases in oil prices, inflation surged ominously during 
September, the government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices jumped 1.6% for the month, after a 1.3% increase in August. 
Taken together, the increases mark the biggest two-month gain since 1980 and 
make it all the more difficult for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The September increase, which equates to an annual inflation rate of 20.9%, was 
primarily attributable to soaring energy costs. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
on Aug. 2, crude oil prices have doubled, nearing $40 a barrel in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is getting out of hand," said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist at 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The worrisome trend was acknowledged by the White House. "Inflation going up is 
never good news," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that, even if increases in the volatile energy and food sectors 
are excluded from September's producer price index, wholesale prices rose by 
0.6% for the month -- the equivalent of more than 7% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers suggest that the underlying inflation rate has picked up," said 
Sara Johnson, an economist at Data Resources Inc. in Boston. "I think we can 
expect to see steep increases in October and November as well." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales jumped 1.1% in 
September to a seasonally adjusted $151.2 billion. The increase reflected 
soaring gasoline prices and rebounding auto sales. Retail sales had declined 
0.4% in August. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sales report indicated that higher prices have not yet dampened 
consumer spending, economists warned that, as recession looms nearer, inflation 
may hit the economy with a second punch. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, we have stagflation," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief 
economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York, referring to the 1970s 
phenomenon of declining growth accompanied by rising prices. "The economy is 
weak, and there isn't enough liquidity in the system." 
</P>
<P>
Although inflationary pressures are likely to make it more difficult for the 
Federal Reserve to ease interest rates, Data Resources' Johnson said she 
believes the threat of recession should receive priority consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary concern at this stage should be stabilizing the economy by easing 
interest rates and stimulating demand," she said. Besides, Johnson added, 
"recession itself would reduce inflationary pressures." 
</P>
<P>
"We have inflation because of the temporary increase in oil prices," Kellner 
said. He urged the Fed "to release the chokehold . . . on the economy" even 
before Congress reaches agreement on the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, however, refused to criticize the Federal Reserve's reluctance 
to ease interest rates to stimulate growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about growth and about preventing a recession," Fitzwater 
said, "and we think the Fed has recognized all these factors and is on the 
right course." 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Assn., also supported the 
current Fed policy. "They have to move with caution and prudence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gramley expressed hope that energy-fueled inflation could subside in 
several months, particularly if the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved without 
military conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just clear that, when oil prices double, you are going to have to swallow 
hard for three to six months. But, if the danger of a shooting war (in the 
Middle East) recedes, then oil prices can't stay at $40 per barrel," he said. 
"I think we can look forward with confidence to several months of high prices, 
but I don't think it will be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
As the inflation report was issued, a group of corporate chiefs meeting in Hot 
Springs, Va., warned that the U.S. economy appears to be tottering on the edge 
of recession, although it has not yet fallen into a full slump.

"It feels like a recession in some segments, but other segments are quite 
good," said John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric Co., mirroring the 
ambivalent attitude of his colleagues at the Business Council, a group of 
current and former chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
Recessionary concerns were echoed in a survey of corporate economists presented 
at the Business Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The economy will have a period of "very weak growth" through mid-1991, the 
economists said in the survey, and "there is a significant chance of 
recession." The report blamed oil prices for the reduced growth prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Executives attending the session acknowledged that business conditions clearly 
had deteriorated since their last gathering in May. But they were not prepared 
to proclaim the end of the nation's eight-year economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is kind of a recession psychology among (auto) dealers and customers," 
said Roger B. Smith, recently retired chairman of General Motors Corp. and the 
Business Council's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
But "price incentives" should help domestic sales, he said, and foreign 
prospects are enhanced by growing demand from new markets in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, was more pessimistic, 
saying the United States is "either already in or entering a recession." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no place where we are not seeing a softening of business, and in some 
places a real recession," Butcher said. "The real estate business is lousy -- 
the bottom has not been reached." 
</P>
<P>
The Business Council report, based on a survey of 20 corporate economists, 
forecast anemic economic growth of less than 1% until the middle of 1991, with 
more vigorous expansion expected in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
A recession is formally defined as two consecutive calendar quarters in which 
the nation's output of goods and services declines. Only five of the 20 
economists advising the Business Council believed a recession is in the cards.

THE WHITE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HOPES THE ANC WILL EASE UP ON ITS BELIEF IN

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten months ago, a black South African businessman emerged from a prison visit 
with Nelson Mandela and raised the hopes of free-market advocates by announcing 
that the African National Congress leader was beginning to sound soft on 
nationalization. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela promptly sent his followers a rare message: "The nationalization of the 
mines, banks and monopoly industries is the policy of the ANC, and a change or 
modification of our views in this regard is inconceivable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change of Heart? 
</P>
<P>
But a few days ago, the ANC revealed, for the first time since it was legalized 
Feb. 2, what it has in mind for the post-apartheid economy of South Africa, the 
most economically powerful nation in sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The word nationalization was mentioned only once -- in a threat to 
re-nationalize public utilities if the government proceeds with plans to 
privatize them. 
</P>
<P>
Is the ANC undergoing a change of heart? Or has it just learned that 
nationalization is one of the most dangerously loaded words in the vocabulary 
of whites here? 
</P>
<P>
The answer appears to be a little of both, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-page "discussion paper," which reflects current thinking among ANC 
economists, suggests that the ANC has backed away from its rigid belief in a 
centrally controlled economy. 
</P>
<P>
And it has eased white fears that property and bank accounts would be summarily 
nationalized under an ANC government. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC envisions a mixed economy with a healthy private sector. 
</P>
<P>
But it also sees a strong role for the government in directing the economy, to 
correct severe racial inequities, redistributing wealth from the rich white 
minority to the impoverished black majority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closing the Gap 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelmingly white business establishment hasn't been overjoyed with the 
ANC document. But there is no panic yet, and some even see signs for hope. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC policy statement "represents some closing of the gap between rhetoric 
and reality," the South African Chamber of Business said. "Many businessmen see 
this ANC document as one small step for realism but a huge step for the ANC." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the chamber said, "the overall impression remains that of an 
organization which refuses to acknowledge what has manifestly failed 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber says the ANC and business leaders agree on only two things: the 
need to restore business confidence and the need to create enough wealth and 
employment to accommodate black as well as white South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
They disagree strongly about which must come first, economic growth or wealth 
redistribution. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC thinks government- directed redistribution will spur growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The engine of growth in the economy . . . should be the growing satisfaction 
of the basic needs of the impoverished and deprived majority," it says. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity is one example the ANC has cited. Providing electricity to more 
black areas will create jobs, which will have a multiplier effect and begin to 
redistribute wealth, ANC economists say. 
</P>
<P>
But many business leaders have been trying to persuade the ANC that the economy 
will only grow and improve the life of blacks if free enterprise is encouraged, 
a South African version of Ronald Reagan's trickle-down theory. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't escape our responsibility (to) uplift the poor," said Peter 
Haasbroek, an economist for Barlow Rand, the largest industrial conglomerate in 
South Africa. "But we (business and the ANC) differ on the methods." 
</P>
<P>
"Business is not opposed to slow, careful, step-by-step change," he added. 
"What we fear are marked, radical changes in policy." 
</P>
<P>
But the ANC is under pressure to make things happen quickly. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't want to scare off white business and investors from the United 
States and Europe. Yet, expectations have been raised among black South 
Africans, who outnumber whites 5 to 1 but who own less than 2% of the country's 
productive assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Black South Africans look up to the ANC and say: 'We definitely don't expect 
our position to continue like this forever,' " says Tito Mboweni, an ANC 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What of the Mines? 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are black expectations higher than in the mining industry, currently in 
the hands of a few white-controlled conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
For 35 years, the ANC has been saying it wants to nationalize the mines, which 
account for well over 33% of all exports and employ more than 350,000 black 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the ANC is treading more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
It stops short of calling for nationalization of the mines, saying only that a 
new government would need to consider "the nature and extent of state 
intervention and ownership."

PHILIPPINES / COUP MANIA; 
</P>
<P>
REVOLT IS OVER, BUT DANGER REMAINS 
</P>

<P>
The quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the Philippines' 
second-largest island leaves President Corazon Aquino's beleaguered government 
with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say Aquino's immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end 
a pocket rebellion led by renegade army Col. Alexander Noble on the north coast 
of Mindanao helps counter oft-heard criticism that her four-year-old government 
is indecisive and inept. 
</P>
<P>
And despite widespread fears that the Oct. 4-6 uprising would quickly spread to 
military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to Aquino, 
leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the coup attempt that didn't catch fire," one Western diplomat said. 
"It sort of fizzled before anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
But he and other diplomats see little benefit for Aquino's battered image 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"The international consequence is people saying, 'Yet another revolt in the 
Philippines.' It's like she's under a perpetual onslaught," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, questions linger as to how Noble and about 350 rebel troops so easily 
evaded a much-publicized military manhunt to drive 140 miles from their 
mountain sanctuary, pass unhindered through at least 10 military checkpoints 
and seize two military camps, including the command post of the general who had 
been ordered to capture him -- all without firing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Noble, once chief of staff of Aquino's own security detail, quickly linked up 
with Reuben Canoy, a local politician who heads the so-called Mindanao 
Independence Movement. 
</P>
<P>
The resource-rich island has spawned secession groups since the 16th Century -- 
though Canoy's is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude 
counterfeits of U.S. $5 bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was kind of a farce," one Asian diplomat said. "Only in the 
Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
Noble, best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap, quickly surrendered 
with most of his motley army of soldiers and Higaonon tribal militiamen after 
two World War II-vintage T-28 planes, called Tora Toras here, bombed and 
strafed one of the camps. One plane later crashed and the pilot drowned, the 
revolt's only fatality. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and 
aborted military mutinies. Most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on 
for days, as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other 
soldiers. In one case, mutineers were ordered to do push-ups and attend Bible 
class as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"This time was a different government response altogether, which Noble clearly 
had underestimated," said University of the Philippines political scientist 
Alex Magno. "He expected another standoff and hoped for other camps to defect. 
He got bombed instead." 
</P>
<P>
After the revolt, the government toughened its anti-coup law, boosting the 
maximum penalty from 12 years to life in prison. Aquino's spokesman, Tomas 
Gomez III, urged other rebel leaders to take "the honorable way out" -- 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Noble made his move on the day a presidential fact-finding board 
issued a long-awaited 609-page report on the causes of last December's coup 
attempt in Manila, which left more than 100 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
After 332 witnesses, 226 sworn statements and 4,100 documents, the so-called 
Davide Commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue -- but 
unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future. 
</P>
<P>
Commission member Delfin Lazaro estimated that 70 officers involved in last 
December's coup attempt, which came closest to toppling Aquino, are still at 
large and still plotting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult for them to get the critical mass to launch a 
successful coup," he said. "But they'll keep trying. What else can they do?"

A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of U.S. troops deployed in the Persian Gulf has topped 200,000 as 
the military buildup begins to slow, U.S. officials said. The official troop 
count still stands at 175,000, but an upward revision is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
An Army Reserve unit based in New Orleans will be released from active duty 
next Friday. The 1192nd Transportation Terminal Unit will be the first of 259 
reserve units called to active duty in the gulf crisis to be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu asked the Japanese Parliament to pass a 
law authorizing him to send soldiers to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he would hold Western leaders responsible 
for the deaths of any Iraqi children caused by lack of food or medicine as a 
result of the international embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In another warning, Iraq told the Soviet Union that its military advisers and 
other technicians in Iraq will not be allowed to return home if the Soviets 
provide Iraqi military secrets to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of influential Kuwaitis in exile were scheduled to meet in Saudi 
Arabia today to press efforts to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to 
discuss the kind of country they hope to rebuild if the occupation ends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
About 250 Americans and their dependents and a handful of Canadian refugees 
from Kuwait arrived in Raleigh, N.C., in what may be the last U.S.-sponsored 
airlift of Western citizens trapped in the occupied nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terrorism Front: 
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, the Speaker of Egypt's Parliament and three bodyguards were killed by 
gunmen on motorcycles. The government previously had warned of possible 
terrorist strikes in response to Egypt's opposition to Iraqi aggression.

The chartered U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service airplane disappeared 280 miles 
northwest of Point Barrow, an agency spokesman said. Point Barrow is the 
northernmost point of land in the United States.

250 AMERICANS BACK HOME FROM KUWAIT;

REFUGEES: THE FREEDOM FLIGHT LANDS IN NORTH CAROLINA, ENDING TWO MONTHS OF 
TERROR IN THE PERSIAN GULF.

<P>
About 250 Americans and their dependents returned to the United States on 
Friday, putting behind them more than two months of terror in Kuwait but 
leaving many of their loved ones behind. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the flight that landed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport were 
seven Canadians, officials said. A total of 103 children and infants were among 
the passengers, and about half the adults were young men. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids looked great," said Joe Dean, secretary of the North Carolina 
Department of Crime Control and Public Safety, one of many state, federal and 
voluntary agencies on hand to assist in the repatriation. "Everyone appeared 
tired but happy to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Among the first passengers to disembark were two unaccompanied girls, Sara, 6, 
and Mariam, 4. Their mother, identified only as Connie, from Chicago, was there 
to greet them, and the three wept and clung to one another in a tiny cluster on 
the Tarmac. Their husband and father is a Kuwaiti national still stranded in 
the occupied country. 
</P>
<P>
Connie had left Kuwait on Aug. 1 to visit her father in Chicago for two weeks, 
leaving the girls with her husband, a senior oil company engineer. Six hours 
after she arrived in Chicago, Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Connie refused to meet with reporters, but she talked briefly to Dean before 
rushing to catch a flight back to Illinois with her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
She told Dean that her husband had tried desperately, but to no avail, to get 
the girls on earlier "freedom flights." 
</P>
<P>
"He'd like to get out, too, but can't," the mother, who appeared to be in her 
late 20s, was quoted by Dean as saying. He said Connie feels strongly that 
President Bush should have "sent the Marines in." 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting too long," she told Dean, readily acknowledging that a U.S. 
invasion clearly might have cost the lives of her family. 
</P>
<P>
Inside an abandoned terminal, a huge repatriation center was set up, complete 
with a day-care center equipped with cribs and cots -- and a balloon maker who 
entertained scores of young children. Nearby, some of the mothers were feeding 
their babies, many of them newborns. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the adults were busy being interviewed by State Department and 
immigration officials and making travel arrangements to their next 
destinations. Others lined up to make long-distance telephone calls on free 
lines that were provided. 
</P>
<P>
Their arrival brings to more than 2,100 the number of American hostages who 
have been allowed to leave Kuwait. Twenty-two of the passengers boarded the 
plane during a stop in Baghdad, Iraq, according to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
All of the returned hostages had endured a long and arduous trip out of Kuwait. 
Their departure had begun more than 36 hours earlier, after boarding 10 buses 
in Kuwait city for what State Department officials said should have been a 
three-hour ride that turned instead into "a 10-hour ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being driven to the airport in Basra, Iraq, as scheduled, the buses 
took the hostages to a hotel in Kuwait city where, the hostages said, they were 
subjected to interrogation and harassment by Iraqi security forces brandishing 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown number apparently chose to return to their homes in Kuwait instead 
of proceeding, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at the Iraq-Kuwait border checkpoint, the hostages again were 
interrogated for up to three hours. 
</P>
<P>
According to State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, seven hostages 
were not allowed to board the plane to Baghdad. Once in the Iraqi capital, she 
said, an American woman with a Jordanian husband and their two children, as 
well as another American, who was ill, were taken off the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers was a Palestinian woman in a wheelchair who said she 
brought out a 5-year-old boy whose American father had fled alone across the 
Kuwait desert into Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who brought her own four children here, said she has located the 
boy's father and that the father and son would soon be united. 
</P>
<P>
She refused to give his name or her own name. But like a second returned gulf 
refugee, she said that although the trip out of Kuwait was harrowing, they were 
not threatened or interrogated by Iraqi soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Issa, 37, a U.S. citizen and a former Marine, agreed, saying that the 
Iraqis had only 'tried to break us down mentally' by making the busloads of 
passengers sit in the desert for hours on end without food or water. 
</P>
<P>
They both said that, even on the Iraqi Airways flight from Basra to Baghdad, 
there was little sustenance. Issa said the flight crew charged him and his 
family $72 for four bottles of juice. 
</P>
<P>
Issa arrived with his wife, 33, and his parents. He said U.S. embassy officials 
in Kuwait told him that more than 1,000 Americans are still in Kuwait.

An Iraqi opposition group based in London said Friday that Iraq is considering 
withdrawing from Kuwait and that its ruling political party has circulated a 
questionnaire asking key members for their opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Democratic Party-Iraq said President Saddam Hussein might use the 
survey as a way of justifying a withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan party said in a news release received in Nicosia from its London

A clandestine firecracker factory exploded in the central Philippines, killing 
five people and seriously injuring seven others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those injured were quoted as saying they were making firecrackers from 
22 pounds of chloride nitrate when one of them accidentally ignited the 
chemical, which was kept in a drum. The drum exploded, causing the two-story 
house to collapse along with three concrete walls nearby. The manufacture of 
firecrackers is banned in the Philippines, but the practice is tolerated, 
especially when the Christmas and New Year season is approaching.

The South African government postponed a key reform in retaliation for a blast 
of criticism from Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. Justice Minister 
Hendrik J. Coetseesaid that, following ANC accusations that Pretoria was trying 
to undermine black-white reconciliation, he would delay announcing guidelines 
for the release of political prisoners and the return of exiles. The two issues 
are among the ANC's conditions for entering formal negotiations with the white 
government on ending apartheid and enfranchising the black majority.

Leaders of local Lao Family organizations in Fresno and Garden Grove have 
denied that their agencies are involved in "shakedowns" of ethnic Hmong 
refugees to fund a resistance movement in Laos. Officials of the Civil Rights 
Bureau of California's Social Services Departments are recommending that 
funding of Lao Family refugee assistance programs throughout California be 
halted after an investigation in San Bernardino and Riverside counties revealed 
the assistance programs were involved in extortion and discrimination against 
Hmong refugees who don't contribute to the anti-communist resistance movement 
in Laos. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance is headed by Gen. Vang Pao, a Hmong leader who lives in Garden 
Grove. The state contends Lao Family employees in San Bernardino County acted 
as "shakedown artists" for Vang Pao's resistance movement, telling refugees 
they could not return to their ethnic homeland in the hill country of Laos 
unless they contributed to his cause. But Tony Vang, head of the Fresno Lao 
Family program, said the Social Services probe assumed "the Lao Family 
throughout the state is doing the same thing. That is not right. And they 
actually jeopardize their own position on civil rights. They are using one 
brush to brush everybody's face."

QUAYLE BACKS LIMIT ON CONGRESS TERMS

Vice President Dan Quayle on Friday joined the political bandwagon to limit the 
terms of officeholders, proposing that members of Congress be forced to retire 
after a specific number of terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I go, I come across a spirit of real disappointment with 
Washington," Quayle said in a speech prepared for delivery in Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are restless. Congress' recent budget spectacular has only added 
fuel to the feeling of 'Let's get rid of the rascals.' " 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's comments came as the Bush Administration sought to represent Congress 
as the roadblock to a budget agreement and deflect criticism heaped on 
President Bush in the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
A text of the vice president's speech to the Society of Professional 
Journalists was released by his office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who served 12 years in Congress, said in a TV interview last week that 
he has long favored limitations on the terms of officeholders. He did not 
propose a specific term limit in his speech Friday, but as a freshman 
congressman, he proposed a 12-year limit on both Senate and House members. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, what is good for the President is good for the Congress," he said 
in his speech, referring to the constitutional amendment limiting the President 
to two terms.

Mayor Marion Barry's attorney asked on Friday for a retrial, saying deputy U.S. 
marshals may have influenced jurors by telling them that alternate jurors would 
have voted to convict the mayor of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney R. Kenneth Mundy also argued that a retrial was justified because some 
jurors witnessed an undercover drug sting operation at the hotel where they 
were sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was convicted on Aug. 10 of a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and 
acquitted of another. The jury could not reach a verdict on 12 other charges, 
including three felony perjury counts, and prosecutors have said they will not 
pursue a new trial on those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy asked in court papers for a postponement of next Friday's scheduled 
pre-sentencing hearing. Barry's parole officer had earlier asked for a delay in 
that proceeding to prepare a pre-sentencing report for U.S. District Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy's request for a retrial comes after interviews with jurors in the case 
who said deputy U.S. marshals told them that the alternate panelists would have 
voted "guilty, guilty, guilty." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mundy's filing, at least two jurors wondered whether the drug 
sting at their hotel had been staged for their benefit. Barry had been arrested 
in an undercover sting operation on Jan. 18.

The World Chess Championship game scheduled for Friday was postponed until 
Monday when challenger Anatoly Karpov took the first of his three allotted 
timeouts from play with champion Garry Kasparov. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the championship tournament said that Karpov's second, 
grandmaster Lajos Portisch, informed chief arbiter Geurt Gijssen by telephone, 
seven minutes before the noon notification deadline, that Karpov was taking a 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
In order to establish the identify of Portisch, the arbiter asked him to sing a 
song familiar to the arbiter, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This task was accomplished to (Gijssen's) satisfaction," it was reported. 
</P>
<P>
The timeout was officially declared when a letter signed by Dr. Nikolai 
Krogius, chief of Karpov's delegation, was handed to Gijssen at 12:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov and Kasparov played to a draw in Monday night's opening match, but the 
champion won the second game on Wednesday. The match will be resumed Monday, 
with Karpov playing the white pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Chess experts said Karpov's request for a timeout so early in the series 
indicated that he needed to re-examine his strategy.

Allen David Mazzella, a California white supremacist, told a jury how he passed 
on the violent racist teachings of Tom Metzger to three Portland, Ore., 
skinheads hours before they beat and killed Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old 
Ethiopian student. Mazzella, 21, testified on behalf of the victim's family, 
who are suing Metzger, 52, of Fallbrook, Calif., and his son, John, 22, for $10 
million, contending the leaders of the White Aryan Resistance and its Aryan 
Youth Movement sent Mazzella and two other white supremacists to Portland in 
1988 to recruit new members and teach a doctrine of hate and violence against 
blacks and Jews.

SOUTH AWASH IN PINCERS OF DUAL STORMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Hurricane Lili and the remains of Tropical Storm Marco locked pincers on the 
South on Friday with a combination of powerful winds, heavy surf and drenching 
rains. At least 10 people have died in the storms. 
</P>
<P>
Lili lurked off the shore of North Carolina, a weakling among hurricanes, 
spinning harmless 8-foot waves into the Outer Banks. Its winds were clocked at 
75 m.p.h. -- barely over the hurricane threshold of 74 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
But the convergence of the hurricane and the tropical storm, plus the dying 
remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus, brought a third day of rain and dangerous 
flooding to parts of the coastal Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
"We got so much rain, so fast. . . . We've never had anything like this," said 
Pam Smith, director of the Richmond County Emergency Management Agency in 
Augusta, Ga., whose west side was swamped by floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, where floods Thursday carried coffins out of a graveyard, 
state climatologist John Purvis said some places had the most rainfall in a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
At the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., forecasters said Lili 
appeared to be veering to the north sooner than expected, decreasing the threat 
of a direct hit on the mid-Atlantic Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The hurricane's center was about 290 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. It 
was moving northwest at nearly 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It poses less threat to the East Coast now," said Herb White of the National 
Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C. "Now it's projected to parallel the coast a 
little farther out." 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said gale-force winds could extend 75 miles inland along the route 
of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists in North Carolina packed ferries to flee the Outer Banks, although the 
most noticeable signs of the storm were waves big enough to thrill surfers. 
</P>
<P>
The real danger for the time being lay farther south, in Georgia, where four 
people drowned in rising floodwaters that ravaged the Augusta area. The floods 
were blamed on remnants of Tropical Storm Marco, which blew north Thursday out 
of the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Three people drowned Thursday in South Carolina, and one person drowned and two 
died in storm-related accidents in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
In Augusta and surrounding Richmond County, officials closed all roads and 
declared a state of emergency, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our roads are flooded," she said. "People are trapped in their homes. 
People are hollering out for help through their windows. Some are on the 
rooftops. There are people in their cars floating down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials began evacuating families in the Augusta area Friday 
morning.

The United States detonated a nuclear weapon 2,000 feet beneath the Nevada 
desert Friday, the third such test since the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The blast registered 5.7 in magnitude at the Earthquake Center in Golden, 
Colo., and was felt in Las Vegas, 105 miles away, less than one minute after 
the 10:30 a.m. detonation. 
</P>
<P>
Some Las Vegas residents reported feeling a slight swaying in the wake of the 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Department of Energy spokesman Jim Boyer, speaking from a control point 34 
miles from ground zero, said no radiation leaked into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Airplanes and helicopters equipped with cameras and radiation detection 
equipment circled ground zero at blast time. 
</P>
<P>
"The test was successful. Everything went well," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The test of the nuclear weapon, with a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons, was code 
named "Tenabo" and was the seventh announced nuclear detonation by the United 
States this year. It was the third U.S. nuclear weapons test in the last four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II was a 13-kiloton 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear weapon detonated Friday was positioned in a mined-out chamber at 
the bottom of a vertical shaft sunk into Pahute Mesa, a 5,000-foot-high 
volcanic plateau located deep within the boundaries of the Nevada Test Site. 
</P>
<P>
The test shaft was plugged with grout and cement to prevent radioactive 
material and gasses from escaping into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The detonation, originally scheduled for 7 a.m. Thursday, has been delayed 
several times -- once because of a technical difficulty and other times because 
adverse winds would have carried an accidental leak of radiation toward Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Nevada Test Site became operational in 1951, a total of 706 nuclear 
tests have been conducted at the facility, including 501 since the signing of 
the Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviets in 1963. The treaty, in effect, 
requires that nuclear weapons tests be conducted underground to prevent 
accidental radiation releases from drifting across international borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Test Site, the heart of the country's nuclear weapons testing, is a 
1,350-square-mile outdoor nuclear testing laboratory the size of Rhode Island.

PLAN AIMS TO EXPEDITE AIR BASE CLEANUP; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AGREE TO TACKLE 35 TOXIC WASTE SITES 
AT EDWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State and federal officials have reached agreement on a plan to expedite toxic 
waste cleanup at Edwards Air Force Base that may take decades to complete and 
cost nearly $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has already spent 10 years and an estimated $21 million on 
cleanup efforts at the base, located about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles. 
But that effort has thus far cleaned up only one of 36 contaminated areas, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement between the Air Force, the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency and state health and water officials will govern most of the actual soil 
and ground water cleanup, a task officials expect to cost another $62 million 
and take 30 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy process. It requires a great deal of investigation. It's a 
long, tedious, technological problem," said Capt. Daniel Bowholtz, head of the 
base's environmental planning and compliance branch. Edwards is the 
second-largest Air Force base in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, finalized Thursday night when it was approved at a California 
Regional Water Quality Control Board meeting in Barstow, followed the base's 
addition in late August to the EPA's National Priorities List. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards officials said the contamination stems from years of leaking 
underground tanks, jet fuel spills, landfill and industrial activities. They 
said the contamination poses no immediate health danger either on or off the 
base but could pose a long-term threat to drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Bowholtz said the base's placement on the National Priorities List and the 
ensuing agreement should help make the base eligible for more cleanup funding. 
He said base officials have earmarked $10 million for cleanup work in the 
coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The 36 identified contamination sites at Edwards are divided into 20 geographic 
areas of the base, which covers about 300,000 acres in the Mojave Desert near 
the border of Kern and Los Angeles counties. Most are in the main base area or 
near the base's astronautics lab. 
</P>
<P>
EPA documents say "large amounts of fuel" have been spilled at the Main and 
South base areas of Edwards over the years, and cite "poor disposal practices" 
that allowed solvents to seep into the ground. They also cite an abandoned 
landfill containing pesticides and heavy metals. 
</P>
<P>
EPA documents also say a variety of solvents -- trichloroethylene, methylene 
chloride and others -- are present in the ground water under the base. But 
Bowholtz said the pollution is in an upper-level aquifer that is separate from 
the deeper aquifer that supplies the base's water. 
</P>
<P>
Bowholtz also said there is some concern that contamination from the abandoned 
landfill could migrate to the base's main water well about three miles away. 
But he said base officials believe the migration would occur very slowly, if at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives state and federal agencies the power to oversee and advise 
on the cleanup and provides for the resolution of disputes among the agencies. 
It also mandates a community relations program to inform the public of 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Bowholtz said the Air Force developed its latest cost estimate for the cleanup, 
$82.8 million, in the last several months. Officials said there is no 
time-frame for completion of the work because investigative work remains 
unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, Edwards will have to regularly seek funding from a special 
federal account, the Defense Environmental Restoration Account, which is 
similar to the Superfund program that the EPA uses to clean up non-federal 
hazardous waste sites.

NATE ASARO; MADE A FORTUNE IN PORTABLE TOILET BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nate Asaro, who made a fortune renting portable toilets to building sites 
during the housing boom in the Los Angeles area during the '50s, '60s and '70s, 
has died. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
Asaro died Wednesday at his home in Olivenhain in northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Asaro, affectionately known throughout the construction industry as 
"Outhouse Nate," had upward of 1,500 portable toilets on building sites in 
Southern California. His firm, Arbor Sanitation Co., was one of the biggest in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
His company also rented the portable outhouses to the Tournament of Roses 
parade, Christmas tree lots, golf tournaments, auto races and special events 
including private parties, weddings and bar mitzvahs. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1974 housing slump The Times carried a feature story about the 
unusual business with a photograph of Asaro glumly looking out over an acre of 
unrented portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The story and photograph were reprinted in newspapers across the nation, and 
Johnny Carson commented about the "Portable Toilet King's predicament" in one 
of his monologues. 
</P>
<P>
Asaro and his family lived in the Westfield area of Rolling Hills Estates for 
25 years before moving in 1980 to Olivenhain. In recent years he built and 
operated industrial parks in Arizona and California. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Yvonne; son, Brad; daughter, Robin Dexter; grandson 
Wally, and two brothers, Frank and Ray. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be conducted at 11 a.m. today at the Eternal Hills 
Mortuary Chapel in Oceanside.

COLLEGES WORRIED ABOUT VOTER BACKLASH; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 143: OFFICIALS OF STATE'S HIGHER-EDUCATION SYSTEMS FRET THAT DWINDLING 
SUPPORT FOR BONDS COULD SINK $450-MILLION MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Arguments over Proposition 143 -- an initiative that would provide $450 million 
for public colleges and universities -- generally mirror the debate over using 
bonds to alleviate crowding in California's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of California's public colleges and universities fear that voters, 
tiring of repeated calls to support construction bond issues, may reject 
Proposition 143 on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're worried about the trend line," said William B. Baker, the University of 
California's vice president for business and university relations, noting that 
voter support for higher-education bond issues has dropped from 60% in 1986 to 
58% in 1988 and 55% in last June's primary election. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also worried about a general voter backlash against taxes and the 
anti-government sentiment that seems to be sweeping the country," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Steve McCarthy, spokesman for the 20-campus California State University system, 
said: "Our concern is that if we have to keep going to bond financing -- if 
another source isn't found -- one of these times we're going to lose one." 
</P>
<P>
David Mertes, chancellor of the statewide community college system, said he 
felt "positive" about Proposition 143's outcome because "the voting public has 
always supported our need for new facilities, but there is increasing concern 
that these bond measures can't continue forever." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three systems had hoped for a single vote on a $900-million bond 
issue last June, but Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders decided 
instead on two measures, each for $450 million. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be divided equally among the three higher-education segments. 
It would be spent to accommodate growth, to make technological improvements in 
both instruction and research and to improve earthquake safety. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment at UC, CSU and the community colleges is expected to increase an 
average of 57,000 students per year through the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that students who benefit from a college education should pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Something worth having is worth paying for," the official ballot argument 
against Proposition 143 states. "Therefore, if this $450 million is truly 
needed at these schools, then the people who use the facilities should pay for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The "no" argument was signed by Thomas Tryon, chairman of the Board of 
Supervisors in Calaveras County; Anthony G. Bajada, professor of music at Cal 
State L.A., and Ted Brown, chairman of the Los Angeles County central committee 
of the Libertarian Party of California. 
</P>
<P>
If the bonds are approved, in the Los Angeles area they would provide $32 
million for earthquake renovations at the Powell Library at UCLA, $27 million 
for a new engineering building at UC Irvine, $11.5 million for utility 
improvements at Cal State Northridge, $7.9 million to begin construction of a 
new classroom and laboratory building at Cal Poly Pomona and $4.5 million for a 
business/technology building at the two-year Mt. San Jacinto College, among 
many other projects. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation approving the bond measure calls for the money to be spent on 
existing campuses, not on the new campuses that all three systems are planning.

TEACHER FACING DISCIPLINE OVER MOVIE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: "QUEST FOR FIRE", AN R-RATED FILM WITH SEX AND CANNIBALISM SCENES 
WAS SCREENED FOR SEVENTH-GRADE SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS.

School officials are considering disciplinary action against a teacher who 
showed an edited version of "Quest for Fire," an R-rated caveman movie with sex 
and cannibalism scenes, to a seventh-grade social studies class. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Unified School District learned of the screening at the 
Sequoia Intermediate School after parents complained, a school official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 movie was not approved by a district committee that normally reviews 
all sex education films, said Richard Simpson, an assistant superintendent for 
instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said it should have been submitted to that committee because of scenes 
revealing nudity, even though it was not intended as a sex education film. He 
also said parents should have been told that the film would be shown. 
</P>
<P>
The film apparently was shown in connection with lessons on history and social 
science. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes in the edited version shown to the classroom included "scenes of 
violence. There are scenes that suggest cannibalism. There are scenes that 
suggest sexual activity," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials will decide what action to take against the teacher next 
week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the incident is a personnel matter, Simpson declined to name the 
teacher. But parents identified him as Clint Dillon, a social studies 
instructor who has been at the school for two years. Dillon declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Two teachers showed a different, edited-for-television version of the film to 
two 10th-grade world history classes at Newbury Park High School, Principal 
Charles Eklund said. 
</P>
<P>
"Quest for Fire" was directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and stars actors Ron 
Perlman and Rae Dawn Chong as prehistoric lovers. Movie critics lauded the 
French-Canadian film for its special effects, calling it one of the most 
realistic portrayals of a caveman and his search for fire. 
</P>
<P>
But the special effects disturbed parents of Sequoia school children, eight of 
whom complained to the school district, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Muse, 37, whose 12-year-old daughter Danielle saw the movie along with a 
class of about 30, said she was shocked by her daughter's graphic description 
of dismemberment, violence and nudity. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this man and this woman and they were naked and tied up and hanging 
upside down. The man's arm was ripped off and a group of cannibals was eating 
his arm," Muse said. "When she came home, she was sick to her stomach. This 
movie really bothered her." 
</P>
<P>
Other parents told Muse that their children also described the film as 
sickening, and one child had nightmares of cannibals, Muse said.

ECONOMISTS DEBATE EFFECT OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: MANY BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD SPUR INVESTMENT BUT AREN'T SURE HOW STRONG 
THE OVERALL IMPACT WOULD BE. 
</P>

<P>
Underlying the current debate in Washington over a capital gains tax is a 
fundamental question: How much would a cut in the levies on stocks, real estate 
and other investments really stimulate investment and help the economy? 
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe such a cut would spur spending on business expansion, 
new plants and equipment, just as advocates maintain. But many aren't sure how 
powerful that stimulus would be, how much would go to the most desirable 
investments and whether the cut would be worth the distortions of the tax 
system that it would also cause. 
</P>
<P>
And few experts now dispute that a cut in the rate would disproportionately 
benefit the wealthiest Americans at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there would be added risk taking and more entrepreneurial activity," 
said Edward Guay, chief economist at Cigna Corp., the big insurance, health 
care and investment firm in Hartford, Conn. "The question is, 'Is this the best 
way to reach that goal?' " 
</P>
<P>
The issue is a highly charged one, as has been apparent all week in Washington 
in the continuing debates over the unfinished budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
The capital gains tax is levied when individuals sell stocks, real estate, 
timberland and certain other investments for a profit. Until 1986, the 
effective capital gains tax rate was 20%. But when the maximum individual tax 
rate was dropped in the 1986 tax reform bill, the special treatment for capital 
gains was eliminated, raising the effective maximum rate to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
To President Bush, long the chief proponent of a cut, a preferential rate would 
bring enough growth to offset the loss in tax revenue. Individuals would 
suddenly have a far greater incentive to buy stock, and as they did so, 
businesses would find their cost of capital reduced, and could make the 
productive investments that would enable them to remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains taxes aren't now imposed until the assets are sold. If the law 
were changed, many individuals might choose to sell their stocks and reinvest 
in new companies, providing a further economic spur, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
A cut would mean "more productive business investment and, over time, more 
jobs, growth and international competitiveness," argues Charls Walker, chairman 
of the American Council for Capital Formation, a principal advocate for a 
capital gains cut. 
</P>
<P>
But only a fraction of the capital raised by a tax cut would go to the kind of 
productive investments that advocates hail. 
</P>
<P>
Economists note that institutional owners of stock -- insurance companies, for 
example, or pension funds and other non-taxable institutions, or foreigners -- 
receive no benefit from the cut and therefore don't make any added investment. 
More than half of the stocks on U.S. exchanges are owned by such institutions. 
</P>
<P>
One intended beneficiary of the tax break is small and new businesses, which 
represent a particularly vibrant part of the U.S. economy. But less than 1% of 
stock is issued by small businesses, notes Alan Auerbach, a professor of 
economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of money is trivial, so it's really crazy to have an 
across-the-board tax cut if helping small business is your goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal of the tax cut advocates is to increase the pool of venture 
capital that nourishes promising new companies. But again, more than half of 
venture capital doesn't come from individuals but from institutional sources -- 
pension funds and foreigners, for example -- that are unaffected by the break. 
</P>
<P>
Individual investors tend to be less sophisticated, and more likely to put 
their money in the tiny, riskier "penny stock" companies that they believe will 
quickly increase their capital, some analysts assert. 
</P>
<P>
"This tax break has a tendency to lead greedy or inexperienced investors into 
risky, small-capitalization companies," said Guay. "The capital gains tax is a 
great marketing tool for the penny stock brokers." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the economy benefits from the tax only when individuals purchase newly 
issued shares of stock, rather than those that have already been traded. Newly 
issued shares represent only about 2% of transactions, said Bob S. McIntyre, of 
Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group that opposes a capital gains 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department has argued that a cut in the effective rate to 23% 
would stimulate the economy enough to increase tax revenue by $12 billion over 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
But other studies have found that while a cut would initially raise revenues -- 
as investors sold off assets to take profits -- tax revenues would eventually 
flatten out or decline. A staff study by the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee of 
Congress found that lowering the effective rate to 23% would raise revenue in 
the first two years, but by the fifth would bring losses of $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists also worry about the distortions of the tax system that such a 
cut would cause. 
</P>
<P>
It would prompt many Americans to look for ways to lower their taxes by 
converting earned income to investment income. The cut would also complicate 
the tax code, reversing the simplifications that Congress took in 1986 and 
probably making it necessary to write hundreds of pages of new tax rules, 
analysts noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates a lot of work for tax lawyers, accountants and investment advisers 
that doesn't necessarily help the economy at all," Auerbach said. "There's a 
compliance cost." 
</P>
<P>
Guay worries, too, about a cut's tendency to increase indebtedness. The tax 
benefit would prompt many individuals to borrow money to speculate in 
investments, "and more debt is something this economy doesn't need at the 
moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Few now dispute that most of the benefits of a cut would go to the wealthiest 
Americans. According to Administration figures, $27 billion of the $49 billion 
in capital gains in 1990 will go to families whose incomes have averaged 
$200,000 or more for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Families with incomes of $50,000 or less will claim an estimated $4.8 billion 
in capital gains, or less than 10% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
However, advocates of a capital gains tax sometimes argue that even if the 
preferential treatment initially benefits the wealthy, by expanding the economy 
it indirectly benefits -- "trickles down" -- to others. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bosworth, senior fellow at Brookings Institution, said the experience of 
other countries doesn't offer much guidance on how the United States should 
handle the issue of capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
Germany, for example, has a low capital gains tax. But the country has much 
higher corporate profit taxes, which raises its cost of capital and makes it 
difficult to compare the systems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Guay says he believes that a capital gains tax cut can be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy for people to sit at home and not take any risk," he said. "I think 
the country needs something to encourage people to invest their money for a 
possible higher return," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that any evaluation of the benefits of the tax needs to consider 
its secondary effects on the economy.

NEW DODGER MENU -- BUT HOT DOGS STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an appetite for an "expanded menu selection" beyond the hot dog, Peter 
O'Malley, president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, announced Friday that the club 
will switch food concessionaires, ending 29 years with Arthur Food Services. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott Corp.'s Sports &amp; Entertainment Division will operate the stadium 
food concession beginning with the 1991 baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that has been in the works for a long, long time," Tom 
Arthur, president of Arthur Food, said. "I guess it's time to go on to 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had been evaluating the concession contract since June, and had 
asked the Century City-based food company to expand its offering to 
stadium-goers, Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've always felt that the big items sold in a baseball park were hot 
dogs," said Arthur, who introduced other foods in recent years without success. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a drive on about nutrition and health, and people want chickens 
and fruit drinks," he said. "We tried them all but we didn't find that they 
were such a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur even tried sushi once in 1984, "but it didn't go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley announced that the change was part of a "complete renovation and 
modernization of all food facilities at the stadium. The Dodgers expect 
Marriott to retain the traditional Dodger Dog, which is supplied by Farmer 
John/Clougherty Packing Co. of Los Angeles. But Marriott will also to bring 
into the stadium such fast-food chains as Carl's, McDonald's and sandwich 
vendors, said Dodger spokesman Jay Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Professional sports concessions require heavy investment in cookers, venting 
and other equipment whenever menus are enlarged, Arthur said. "And that's 
something we're not prepared to do. We felt that what we had there was 
adequate," he added. Arthur would not disclose financial information on the 
privately held concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott pledged to make Dodger Stadium its "flagship operation" in sports and 
entertainment food, according to Marriott Corp. spokesman Vince Pantuso. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Dodgers and Arthur described the parting as amicable. "Nobody's out 
there with sackcloth and ashes," Arthur said. "We're just going to try to make 
a smooth transition."

British Airways May Create Airline With Soviets: The London-based carrier said 
it has signed an agreement with the Soviet Union's Ministry of Civil Aviation 
to work toward creating a new international airline based in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed airline, dubbed "Air Russia," would be a joint venture, with the 
Soviet state airline Aeroflot holding a majority stake. British Airways said it 
would spend about $39.4 million for its minority stake. If a final agreement is 
reached, the airline would begin operations in 1992 between Moscow and cities 
in Western Europe, North America and the Far East.

L.A. AD AGENCY TURNS ITS EYES TOWARD SPAIN; 
</P>
<P>
CABLE: D'ARCY MASIUS BENTON &amp; BOWLES WILL SHAPE ADS TO PERSUADE CABLE 
VIEWERS TO BUY "PAY-PER-VIEW" COVERAGE OF 1992 SUMMER OLYMPICS.

<P>
A big chunk of the 1992 Summer Olympics' "Pay-Per-View" ad campaign was handed 
on Friday to the Los Angeles agency D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at the agency declined to reveal the size of the deal, but industry 
sources estimate it to be more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now, DMB&amp;B, which already places ads for Burbank-based NBC Television, 
suddenly has its eyes on Barcelona. That's where clients NBC and Cablevision 
will oversee round-the-clock Olympic coverage on three cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
Although NBC's coverage of the major Olympic events will be free, subscribers 
will pay a yet-to-be-determined fee to view extended coverage on cable 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
Besides DMB&amp;B, three other ad agencies and two direct-marketing companies 
will also be involved in the campaign. But DMB&amp;B, which will shape the ad 
strategy and place the ads on TV and radio as well as in magazines and 
newspapers, is the only Los Angeles agency involved. 
</P>
<P>
The ads will begin to appear in October, 1991, said James D. Helin, managing 
director of the agency's Los Angeles office. Some ads will be geared toward 
persuading consumers to buy pay-per-view as holiday gifts. About 25 million 
homes are expected to have cable TV by 1992. Other ads will try to persuade 
owners of bars and restaurants to purchase the package.

REPORT ON MATSUSHITA BOOSTS MCA STOCK PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE SHARES JUMPED $4 AFTER A TOKYO NEWSPAPER ARTICLE SAID THE 
JAPANESE SUITOR MIGHT BID $7.75 BILLION FOR THE WHOLE COMPANY. 
</P>

<P>
MCA Inc. stock rose $4 a share Friday to close at $57.875 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading amid reports of progress in the entertainment company's talks 
to be acquired by Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders pointed in particular to a report from Japan's Mainichi 
Shimbun, a large Tokyo newspaper. The report said Matsushita executives had 
decided to bid for all of MCA, reversing a reported move to buy just MCA's film 
and TV divisions. 
</P>
<P>
In an Oct. 10 story, which circulated in translation among investors in New 
York on Friday, the Japanese paper quoted an unnamed Matsushita executive as 
saying: "Although it is more costly, it is more realistic for us to acquire MCA 
in its entirety and then reorganize the unprofitable divisions, perhaps 
directly under the Matsushita Group, if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
MCA and Matsushita representatives declined to comment on the report, which 
said Matsushita might pay about 1 trillion yen, or roughly $7.75 billion, for 
all of MCA except its broadcast division. 
</P>
<P>
The report also identified Matsushita Executive Vice President Masahiko Hirata 
as the company's chief negotiator in talks with MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Hirata, 59 years old, is a key adviser to Matsushita President Akio Tanii. "He 
is close to the president, and is in charge of the company's international 
diversification strategy," said Yoshi Tsurumi, professor of international 
business at the City University of New York's Baruch College. 
</P>
<P>
An accountant by training, Hirata was previously Matsushita's chief financial 
officer and at one time worked for the company's 50%-owned Victor Co. of Japan 
unit, according to earlier press reports. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1987 report in the Japan Economic Journal, Matsushita President 
Tanii has typically relied on Hirata and another strategist, Executive Vice 
President Shoji Sakuma, in executive major corporate moves. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Hirata has begun face-to-face talks with MCA 
executives. The companies have tried to keep a tight lid on their discussions, 
but Japanese publications have repeatedly reported talks with Matsushita 
executives over the past two weeks.

CONGRESS GREETS NORTHROP CEO WITH ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa was met with contempt Friday in his first 
appearance before Congress since becoming the embattled firm's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa announced that Northrop would provide free of charge 110 badly needed 
gyroscopes for Marine Corps jet fighters. But the gesture, worth about 
$300,000, did little to placate members of the House Government Operations 
Committee, which is investigating Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa said he accepts "responsibility for past failures of individuals and of 
management oversight" but portrayed the company as striving "to correct our 
weaknesses" and asked that the company's contributions "on behalf of the 
defense of this country" be considered. 
</P>
<P>
For the next several hours, however, committee members attacked the firm as a 
"corporate criminal" and for having a "culture of deceit." 
</P>
<P>
"We keep hearing about the new Northrop, but I keep seeing the old Northrop," 
committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, witnesses from the Air Force and Boeing told the committee that 
1,700 nuclear-armed cruise missiles are still using Northrop gyroscopes that 
could freeze in operational use because they don't meet a cold-temperature 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The gyroscopes, which are used in a stabilization device called a flight data 
transmitter, are filled with a fluid that freezes at between minus-40 degrees 
and minus-55 degrees Fahrenheit. The flight data transmitter is supposed to 
operate at high altitude at minus-65 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for the fluid -- known as DC-200 -- to freeze was first 
identified by Northrop in 1983 in a report written by a vice president, but the 
report was not provided to Boeing, the missile's prime contractor, or to the 
Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Two top Northrop executives, Joseph Yamron and Leopold Engler, were indicted on 
criminal charges in the matter, but the Justice Department dropped the charges 
earlier this year when Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 other felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Vice President Arlington Carter said, "It is shocking that (Northrop) 
would have a document in 1983 that showed the . . . fluid would not meet the 
specification." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Northrop failed to give the report to Boeing, Kresa said his efforts 
to get answers have turned up "various and sundry reasons." The matter was not 
viewed as a problem, he added. 
</P>
<P>
It finally became public only after the start of a federal investigation; in 
early 1988 Northrop belatedly notified Boeing of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Jones, the Air Force's civilian supervisor for engineering on the cruise 
missile, testified that Northrop's stabilization device for the missile still 
does not meet specifications and must be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Jones said the Air Force is seeking to buy more of the Northrop 
gyroscopes, because the Los Angeles-based company is the sole producer and the 
Air Force needs about 48 a year for spare parts. Even though the Northrop 
division that produces the gyroscopes is under a contract suspension, the Air 
Force has sought a waiver of the suspension, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials blame Jones, however, for relaxing the cold 
temperature standards and undermining the prosecution of the two Northrop 
executives.

DOW JONES FREEZES SALARIES AND IMPOSES OTHER CUTS;

<P>
Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, is freezing budgets 
for capital spending and salaries and imposing other news and business cutbacks 
to cope with weak financial results and the sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts, announced in an internal memo to managers Thursday, followed weeks of 
rumors about a possible retrenchment and triggered concern over possible future 
layoffs at the media and financial-industry giant. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, a copy of which was obtained Friday, also said Dow Jones will reduce 
management bonuses next year, eliminate all temporary help, try to eliminate 
all editorial staff relocations and reduce space devoted to news in the 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones earlier in the week announced a 17.5% drop in third-quarter profit, 
reflecting a steady downturn attributed principally to the company's 
acquisition of the financial information service Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The internal memo from Dow Jones Chairman Warren H. Phillips and Publisher and 
President Peter R. Kann freezes all capital expenditures immediately and holds 
all 1991 department budgets -- including total salary costs -- at 1990 levels. 
Accounting for inflation, the budget cut would amount to more than 5% for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Dow Jones will sell its corporate jet and reduce its aviation staff, and sell 
excess land purchased for Journal printing plant expansion and printing presses 
in storage, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The memo said Dow Jones would reduce Journal special report inserts and table 
plans for a Journal magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Among its other problems, Dow Jones has been hurt by the recession plaguing 
Wall Street since the 1987 stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Operating income at Dow Jones' business publications, which include the Journal 
and Barron's weekly, dropped 80% in the second quarter. Advertising linage at 
the Journal dropped 16% in the period.

Investor Arthur Goldberg took charge of Bally Manufacturing Corp. Friday and 
announced that he will sell assets -- which range from casinos to health clubs 
-- to cut the company's staggering debt. 
</P>
<P>
Bally also said its Nevada casino unit would miss an $18.4-million interest 
payment due Oct. 15, prompting Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investor 
Service to lower the company's debt rating. 
</P>
<P>
Stock in Chicago-based Bally fell 12.5 cents to $3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, named interim chief executive to succeed the retiring Robert Mullane, 
said he will begin a major review of all Bally businesses to decide what to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
"Those companies not identified as core companies will be sold," he said. "It's 
a full-scale, ground-zero examination." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its four casinos in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City, N.J., 
Bally operates 315 health and tennis clubs and makes gaming devices, lottery 
ticket machines and exercise equipment.

GROUP OF INVESTORS MAY BID FOR PAN AM SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former boss of Pan American World Airways' Northeast shuttle is said to be 
assembling a group of investors to make a bid for the shuttle operation. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce R. Nobles has met two or three times recently with Pan Am representatives 
to discuss a possible sale, but no agreements have been reached, said William 
Genoese Sr., director of the Teamsters union's airline division. The Teamsters 
represent 6,200 Pan Am reservations agents, ticket takers, clerical workers and 
other non-flying personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Nobles, reached at his home in New York on Friday, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Nobles is the second possible bidder to emerge for the shuttle, which 
money-losing Pan Am put up for sale in May. America West Airlines, based in 
Phoenix, would also like to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am wants $250 million for the shuttle, which hauls passengers between New 
York and Boston and between New York and Washington. The northeast air corridor 
is the nation's busiest, with 3.7 million travelers annually. 
</P>
<P>
Few people know the shuttle and its competition better than Nobles, who most 
recently served as president of the rival Trump Shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
A personable executive with a flair for promotion, Nobles was fired from the 
Trump Shuttle in June when the airline came under pressure to reduce costs. It 
is owned by flamboyant New York developer Donald J. Trump, who is facing a 
severe cash squeeze at his New Jersey casino operations. 
</P>
<P>
One problem any bidder for the Pan Am shuttle faces is financing. Banks have 
grown increasingly wary of financing leveraged buyouts; a union offer for the 
parent of United Airlines collapsed earlier this week because it lacked bank 
support. 
</P>
<P>
America West is said to be looking for loans from companies other than banks, 
such as insurance companies and equipment manufacturers, to finance a possible 
acquisition of the Pan Am shuttle. It recently received a $150-million infusion 
from manufacturers and leasing firms as part of a $5-billion deal to lease or 
buy 118 Airbus Industrie airliners. 
</P>
<P>
America West has said some of that money could be used to buy the shuttle.

DOW ENDS ITS THREE-DAY FALL, CLIMBS 32.92

<P>
Stock prices snapped back from a three-day slide Friday on rumors that Iraq may 
be considering a pullout from Kuwait, falling oil prices and rallying Treasury 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Short covering also helped fuel the rebound, as traders who had correctly 
forecast stocks' drop covered their positions. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index jumped 32.92 points, or about 1.4%, to end the 
week at 2,398.02, cutting its loss for the week to 112.62 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 917 issues rising, 640 declining and 432 
unchanged. Big Board volume rose to 187.49 million shares, up from 180.06 
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Several reports suggesting that Iraq may consider withdrawing from Kuwait 
resulted in oil prices falling 73 cents a barrel to close at $39.69 on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, which boosted stock and bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
A Kurdish rebel group said Friday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was 
consulting members of his ruling Baath Party on whether to withdraw from 
Kuwait. A British television report also suggested that Saddam may be 
considering withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a news market," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear, Stearns 
&amp; Co. "We're responsive to any rumors and news." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Dorr, head trader at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., said gains in the bond 
market were a major impetus for Wall Street's rally. "There's enough real cash 
out there that investors will keep finding value." 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets showed little reaction to a surprisingly brisk 1.6% rise in 
September producer prices. "Because of (higher) energy costs, people were just 
expecting bad numbers," said Jay McElroy at 1838 Investment Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
Among market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Earnings worries continued to hit many stocks. Shares of Chemical Banking 
continued to decline, losing 5/8 to 12 5/8, one day after the bank slashed its 
dividend. Other bank issues turned in a mixed showing. J.P. Morgan rose 1 3/8 
to 33 1/2, and BankAmerica gained 1/2 to 18 3/8, but Manufacturers Hanover 
dropped 3/4 to 19 1/4 and Security Pacific eased 1/4 to 19 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Deere slipped 7/8 to 40. Prudential-Bache cut its 1990 and 1991 earnings 
estimates, based on declining sales. Alcoa dropped 1 to 53 1/2 on its earnings 
report. 
</P>
<P>
* Shares of Octel Communications dropped 2 1/8 to 8. Analysts lowered earnings 
estimates on the company, which reported disappointing first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
* Many battered growth stocks rebounded. Merck added 2 to 77 1/4, Pepsico 
gained 1 1/8 to 23 3/4, Boeing rose 1 1/2 to 44 1/2 and Teradata jumped 7/8 to 
10 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* MCA jumped 4 to 57 7/8. Sources familiar with talks between the company and 
Matsushita said the two firms have signed a confidentiality agreement allowing 
MCA to provide Matsushita with detailed financial information. 
</P>
<P>
* In the computer sector, third-quarter results of Intel Corp. came within the 
range of Wall Street expectations, and its stock gained 7/8 to 30. But Compaq 
dropped 2 1/4 to 36 3/4. Kidder Peabody again said a new laptop computer would 
fall short of Wall Street expectations on price and availability. 
</P>
<P>
* Some retailers snapped back, though much of the gains smacked of 
short-covering rather than real buying. J.C. Penney added 1 5/8 to 39 3/4, 
Sears rose 1/2 to 23, Gap jumped 4 1/4 to 45 3/8, Woolworth rose 1 3/4 to 26 
1/4 and Wet Seal jumped 1 1/8 to 11 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Mattel rose just 1/4 to 16 1/8 despite forecasting third-quarter earnings of 
about 88 cents a share, up 18%. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower after a day of moderate trading in which 
potential buyers were largely sidelined by higher oil prices and losses on Wall 
Street. The key 225-share Nikkei index finished with a loss of 195.47 points at 
22,390.16. 
</P>
<P>
German share prices surged in active trading on a flood of buying from domestic 
and British investors. The 30-share DAX index ended up 31.32 points at 
1,459.70, gaining 67.94 points over the week. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also closed lower on London's Stock Exchange after fluctuating 
narrowly in thin trading. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 1.8 
points at 2,100.4.

<P>
Bond Prices Jump Almost $11 Higher 
</P>
<P>
The main U.S. Treasury bond soared nearly $11 on the report that Iraq was 
considering withdrawing from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The government's benchmark 30-year bond gained 1 3/32 point, or $10.94 per 
$1,000 in face amount, regaining all of a $9 drop Thursday. Its yield, which 
falls when prices rise, sank to 8.95% from 9.06% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, junk bond prices continued to plummet, traders said, showing that the 
market was increasingly concerned about a severe recession ahead. The market 
was unnerved by a new bond default by Bally's Grand on its 11.5% first-mortgage 
bonds. Some junk bonds sank as much 10 points on the news. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.875%, unchanged from late Thursday. 
</P>

Dollar Ends Mixed in Nervous Trading 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar finished mixed in a world market that traders said was 
influenced by a myriad of factors, from uncertainty in federal budget 
negotiations to the falling oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a very volatile market," said Lloyd G. Atkinson, chief economist 
with the Bank of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson said foreign traders were shocked at developments in Washington, where 
budget negotiators have been unable to agree. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at 129.05 Japanese yen, down from 129.47 on Thursday. In 
Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.65 yen to close at 129.30 yen. Later, in London, it 
fell to 128.65 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The German mark also gained against the dollar, rising to 1.5243 marks from 
1.5138 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, one British pound fetched $1.9675, down from Thursday's $1.9775. 
But in London, the pound rose to $1.9740 from $1.9640 late Thursday.

Silver Prices Rise; Oil Futures Mixed

Silver prices rose Friday after hitting a new 14-year low that some analysts 
said might have marked the bottom of a dramatic slide. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, gold futures advanced, orange juice collapsed, 
petroleum futures were mixed, grains and soybeans retreated and livestock and 
meat futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Silver settled 7 to 7.1 cents higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the 
contract for spot delivery up 7.1 cents at $4.306 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold ended $2.20 to $2.30 higher, with spot October at $387.50 an ounce.

DRIVE LAUNCHED TO CURB SUICIDES OF GAY YOUNGSTERS 
</P>

Blaming ultraconservatives for fostering an anti-gay climate that can 
contribute to suicide, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays launched a 
nationwide education program Friday to combat a newly acknowledged crisis of 
gay and lesbian youth suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies estimate that gay youngsters are three times as likely as non-gays 
to attempt suicide and that they account for about 30% of the 5,000 youth 
suicides each year, according to Paulette Goodman, president of the 
Washington-based group, now holding its annual convention at the Hyatt Regency 
Alicante in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"People who express themselves like (anti-gay minister) Lou Sheldon don't 
appreciate that children are killing themselves day after day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sheldon, president of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, and 
Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) prevailed upon Louis Sullivan, secretary 
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to repudiate a January, 
1990, government report that contained the gay suicide statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman estimated that one family in four is touched by homosexuality. But 
often, she said, parents learn of their child's homosexual orientation only 
after a suicide attempt. Others may never reveal their sexual preference out of 
shame and fear. 
</P>
<P>
The three-phase national project "Respect All Youth" will develop informational 
materials designed to increase awareness of issues that may lead young people 
to suicide; provide a systematic outreach to leaders of national youth 
organizations, including Boy and Girl Scouts and the 4-H, as well as religious 
groups and other professions, and provide training for the 200 chapters of 
PFLAG to help them reach youth and teachers in the local community. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in favor of the project were the Rt. Rev. Oliver B. Garver, retired 
suffragan bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles; Jackie Goldberg, 
president of the Los Angeles School Board, and Virginia Uribe, direct of 
Project 10, a support program in public high schools for gay and lesbian teens 
to prevent them from dropping out and turning to high-risk behavior such as 
suicide, substance abuse and HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance for Phase One was provided by the United Thank Offering 
Fund of the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a Walnut Creek mother of four, Mary Griffith, spoke movingly of 
her son, Bobby, who committed suicide seven years ago at age 20. 
</P>
<P>
A devout member of a fundamentalist Presbyterian congregation, Griffith said 
the family sought Christian "reparative therapy" when Bobby disclosed his 
concern over homosexuality at 16. "I was under the illusion that God would heal 
Bobby," she said. Bobby, too, believed he had to accept the church's teachings, 
but after many years could not understand why God wasn't healing him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Bobby jumped from an overpass into the path of a truck and was killed. 
In a diary found after his death, he had written: "I guess I'm no good to 
anyone, not even God." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a button with Bobby's portrait and another with the message "We Love 
Our Gay and Lesbian Children," Griffith said: "I did not know then, as I do 
now, that Bobby did not have any more choice regarding his sexual orientation 
than did my other son and two daughters, all of whom are heterosexual." 
</P>
<P>
She broke down as she concluded: "I have learned in the most painful way 
possible that ignorance, hatred, bigotry and prejudice lead to violence and 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, president of the Traditional Values Coalition, denied that his 
statements have hurt gays. "The very opposite: we are helping the homosexual 
face their underlying condition and encouraging them to seek reparative 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"By ignoring the true cause of the low self-esteem, suicide, alcohol and drug 
abuse, and homosexual tendencies, PFLAG is doing a serious injustice and 
disservice to these troubled youths." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon also opposed the education project on the ground that it teaches 
impressionable children that homosexuality is a viable life alternative.

$10 MILLION VOTED FOR NEW I-5 CHECKPOINT; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: THE BORDER PATROL FACILITY WOULD REPLACE THE PRESENT ONE NEAR SAN 
CLEMENTE, BUT IT WOULD BE THREE MILES FARTHER SOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Senate has approved $10 million for initial construction of a new 
Border Patrol checkpoint along Interstate 5 south of San Clemente, bringing the 
controversial expansion plan one step closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate included the appropriation -- which is supported by the Bush 
Administration -- as part of the budget package that was approved Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal must survive a Senate-House conference committee and then 
be included in whatever final federal budget plan emerges from ongoing 
negotiations. The deadlocked budget for fiscal 1991 is the topic of intense 
debate on Capitol Hill and in the White House, leaving the future of the 
checkpoint and other federal projects in abeyance. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, California lawmakers who support the checkpoint expansion voiced 
confidence Friday that the Senate appropriation gives the $10 million a good 
chance of emerging intact from the budget process. Several described the Senate 
action as the most significant legislative leap to date for the proposed 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this step means it's going to happen," said David Coggin, press 
secretary to U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, the 16-lane checkpoint is not expected to be operational 
until 1995. In addition to the $10 million, federal authorities will have to 
seek $20 million in coming years to complete construction. (About $4 million 
has already been committed for planning and engineering costs.) 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the plan maintain that it will be hard for lawmakers to back 
out once the $10 million is being spent and construction has begun. 
</P>
<P>
Federal immigration authorities consider the checkpoint a vital enforcement 
weapon in turning back the flow of illegal aliens heading to Orange County and 
the Los Angeles area along Interstate 5, the region's busiest north-south 
artery. The San Clemente checkpoint is the busiest of 30 such Border Patrol 
installations from California to Texas, all placed on roads leading from the 
Mexican border. The proposed checkpoint station would replace the current one. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, agents based at the checkpoint made a 
record 75,000 arrests of undocumented immigrants. Officers also regularly seize 
large caches of illicit drugs and other contraband. Authorities say the larger 
station is needed to improve efficiency, increase operating hours and reduce 
the monumental traffic delays that regularly plague northbound motorists, 
sometimes backing them up for more than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"The existing checkpoint is overwhelmed, outdated and ill-prepared to stop the 
thousands of individuals who choose to use I-5 as an artery to circulate drugs, 
contraband and illegal aliens throughout the country," Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) said Friday in a statement. "With these funds, we can build a 
checkpoint that acts more like a red light than a red carpet." 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the checkpoint is a dangerous, risk-laden enterprise that 
should be dismantled or at least suspended until safer operating procedures can 
be developed. The checkpoint's presence amid the heavily traveled corridor has 
contributed to numerous accidents, chases and deaths of undocumented aliens who 
attempt to circumvent the facility on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, 12 people have died while trying to cross the 
freeway near the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
An official for the Coalition for Immigrant Rights and Responsibilities, which 
has advocated increased warning signals and a public-awareness campaign 
directed at drivers and undocumented workers, said a new checkpoint is only 
part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opportunity for the federal government to design a checkpoint 
that can handle what they have to deal with and avoid some of the carnage we 
have been experiencing in the last few years," coalition executive director 
Lilia Powell said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that the federal government help pay for the construction of 
grooves in the road and other safety features that have been recommended by the 
California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from cities near the INS checkpoint -- located five miles south of 
the Orange County line on Interstate 5 -- also have objected to the expansion, 
contending that the new checkpoint would "trap" more immigrants in nearby 
communities that are already trying to cope with large numbers of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
But in San Clemente, the first city north of the checkpoint, officials have 
supported the expansion with the hope of reducing high-speed chases of illegal 
immigrants that sometimes end up in their city and endanger bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fantastic," San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard said of the Senate 
appropriation. "We understand that the Border Patrol has a job to do, but we 
have to protect our city." 
</P>
<P>
Haggard added that she favors plans to construct tollbooth-like barriers that 
would deter cars from running through the checkpoint. Also, with the new 
facility expected to be located three miles south of its current location, the 
mayor said the new site combined with increased inspection lanes should help 
ease traffic congestion near her city. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting Friday with immigration officials, the mayor said that until 
the new facility is built, the city will help the federal agency pursuade 
Caltrans to build walls along the median to prevent undocumented workers from 
scurrying across the southbound lanes to escape detection. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans and the coalition do not support that idea, advocating instead 
public-awareness measures and reducing the speed limit near the inspection 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The present station is a makeshift facility where agents stand on the freeway 
and visually inspect passing traffic, directing potential violators to an 
inspection area. 
</P>
<P>
The new checkpoint station would be a smaller version of the giant U.S.-Mexico 
border crossing some 70 miles to the south. It would be a permanent fixture 
accommodating 16 initial inspection lanes and 4 secondary inspection lanes, the 
latter for supplemental questioning of motorists. The 15-acre site would 
include physical barriers to protect agents, an overhead walkway and expanded 
detention, office and parking space.

report.

2 SCHOOLS CELEBRATE NATIONAL AWARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
Balloons, flags and songs were in abundance Friday at Helen Estock and Arroyo 
elementary schools as the Tustin Unified School District celebrated the 
national awards given to the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
They were among 221 schools nationwide -- 16 in California and three in Orange 
County -- to receive the awards from the U.S. Department of Education. Tustin 
is the only district in the state with two schools to win awards, which are 
based on several factors, including programs, the attitude of staff members, 
interaction of the school with the community and parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration started at Estock in the morning, continued with a VIP luncheon 
and concluded with a ceremony at Arroyo.

ALLEGED ATTACKER PLEADS NOT GUILTY

A 17-year-old Anaheim youth pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he 
inflicted the blows that left 15-year-old Amber Jefferson with a disfiguring 
facial injury. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Municipal Judge Frank F. Fasel ordered Kurt David Wimberly held 
in lieu of $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
The youth is scheduled to appear in court again next Tuesday when a judge will 
decide whether to reduce his bail. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a juvenile court judge gave prosecutors the go-ahead to try 
Wimberly as an adult in the racially charged case. He is accused of throwing a 
piece of glass that left the Garden Grove girl with a deep gash that runs the 
length of her face. Wimberly, who will turn 18 next month, has been in custody 
since the Aug. 7 brawl, which occurred in the parking lot of a Stanton 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with felony mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, infliction of 
great bodily injury and battery. Three others were also charged in connection 
with the incident. Wimberly's father, 42-year-old Earl Wimberly, was charged 
with assault and exhibiting a deadly weapon, and Trevor McClure, 21, was 
charged with exhibiting a deadly weapon and challenging to fight. Prosecutors 
said all three fought a group of people that included Amber Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
On Amber's side, Lewis Jones, 19, was charged with fighting in public and 
malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Both the elder Wimberly and Jones are free on bail. Authorities have issued an 
arrest warrant for McClure, who disappeared shortly after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, as many as 12 people were involved in the fighting 
outside Wimberly's apartment in which youths on both sides armed themselves 
with bats and boards. Amber was the only one injured. TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

The campaign for Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for traffic 
improvements that is on the Nov. 6 Orange County ballot, picked up a 
symbolically important endorsement this week from the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
The league previously had been silent on Measure M, partly because of a split 
membership, according to some of the group's members. 
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to allow our name to be used in campaign literature as a 
supporter," league President Patricia C. Harrigan said. "However, we will not 
be taking an active part in the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Measure M supporters conceded Friday that the league's endorsement carries with 
it no particular bloc of voters, but said it may impress some people who hold 
the organization in high esteem because of its reputation for issuing factual, 
nonpartisan analyses of ballot issues before elections. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

SHOPPERS ASKED TO HELP FILL FOOD BANK

<TEXT>
<P>
Grocery shoppers today will be asked to buy a few extra items to fill the 
dwindling cupboards of an Irvine food bank. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 student volunteers from Irvine schools will be outside major grocery 
stores from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to hand out lists of food and toiletry items 
needed by Irvine Temporary Housing's food bank. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers can pick up a list on their way in and drop off the items on their way 
out to contribute to the food bank's third annual fall food drive. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the food drive is to collect about 400 bags of groceries and 
toiletries, said Louise Wagner, Irvine Temporary Housing's office manager. The 
goal is four times the amount of food collected last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The food and supplies would benefit about 100 families, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Student clubs from Woodbridge, Irvine and University high schools, as well as 
Christ College in Irvine, will be participating. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, funded by the city and state as well as private donations, 
temporarily houses families in the Irvine area and supplies food and utility 
vouchers to families experiencing temporary financial difficulties. Some of the 
families served by the agency are those of servicemen stationed in the Middle 
East, Wagner said. TOM MC QUEENEY

Sculptures and restored antique pictures of downtown Anaheim in foyers and art 
collections displayed throughout the workplace earned awards for three Anaheim 
businesses and a church this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim campus of FHP Inc., the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, Household Bank 
of Anaheim and the Anaheim United Methodist Church received Art in Public 
Places awards this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Arts Council cited the church for its imported, copper wall-like 
sculpture as part of its second annual recognition of art used as part of the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Those honored "have installed art because they see a value in this for their 
clients," said Julie Mayer, an artist who chairs the Art in Public Places 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The council also gave out three so-called chairman's awards. The honors went to 
Multi Vision cable for itscoverage of events in the Anaheim art community, and 
artists Emigdio Vasquez, who has painted and helped restore numerous outdoor 
murals in the city, and Joan Farr, whose large fabric wall hangings drape the 
walls of the Anaheim United Methodist Church. LISA MASCARO

MAN WANTED ON DRUG CHARGES IS ARRESTED AT MOTEL

<P>
A 29-year-old man wanted by North Carolina authorities on drug charges was 
arrested Friday as he walked out of a Costa Mesa motel room, FBI officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Christopher Lynch of Charlotte, N.C., was indicted June 6 by a federal 
grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to distribute in excess of 5 kilograms of 
cocaine, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Lynch apparently learned of the impending grand jury indictment and 
fled North Carolina before it was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
Cox declined to say how authorities learned of Lynch's presence in Costa Mesa. 
The investigation was conducted by FBI agents and officers with North 
Carolina's Charlotte and Mecklenberg County police departments. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch was arrested without incident at an undisclosed motel on Newport 
Boulevard, Cox said. However, a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun "was within 
his reach," he said.

EX-SANTA ANA TEACHER HELD ON SEX COUNTS

<P>
A former Santa Ana math teacher who fled the state just before being charged 
with molesting two male students was arrested Friday in Laredo, Tex., after 
being a fugitive for more than seven months, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Solorzano Provence, 37, a former teacher at Willard Intermediate 
School, had been charged in an arrest warrant issued April 11 with two counts 
each of felony child molestation and misdemeanor child annoyance involving two 
boys, 11 and 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents, in cooperation with Santa Ana and Laredo police, arrested Provence 
without incident about 6 p.m. as he was reporting to work at a store. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities on Friday also found a 14-year-old boy whom Provence had taken with 
him when he fled the state, FBI Agent Wylie B. Cox said. Provence had said that 
the boy was his son, but police expressed doubt after checking birth records. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were trying to identify the boy's relationship to Provence, if 
any, and whether he had been harmed, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the arrest were not immediately available. Cox declined to say 
how investigators found Provence. 
</P>
<P>
Provence, who taught math in both Spanish and English to seventh-graders, was 
accused of the molestations after one of the victims in March confided to a 
school counselor, who notified the Orange County Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Unified School District placed Provence on administrative leave 
while police began an investigation. It is alleged that the molestations 
occurred during a five-month period on school grounds.

COMPANY SUES TO END BUILDING MORATORIUM; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: TAYLOR WOODROW HOMES SEEKS QUIT CLAIM TO DISPUTED LAGUNA NIGUEL 
LAND, $25 MILLION.

Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. filed suit Friday to force Laguna Niguel 
to lift a building moratorium imposed in July when it was disclosed that the 
district attorney was investigating a land transaction in the developer's 
Marina Hills planned community. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also asks an Orange County Superior Court judge to enforce a quit 
claim deed in which public control over the land -- 96 acres of open space -- 
was deeded to Taylor Woodrow. The action seeks to void an earlier offer of 
dedication in which a previous property owner set the land aside as potential 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, Taylor Woodrow Homes filed a $25-million damage claim 
against the city for lost earnings and goodwill. The company alleges that it 
has been unable to fulfill contractual commitments to suppliers and other 
subcontractors or to sell its houses on the disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reluctantly pursuing this action in order to protect Taylor Woodrow's 
interest," said Taylor Woodrow Homes President Gordon Tippell. "We had hoped to 
resolve and conclude the issue with the city but were unfortunately unable to 
do so." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the company said they were forced to file the suit Friday because 
they faced a 90-day deadline established by state law for challenging the 
council's July 17 decision. 
</P>
<P>
After a late-night marathon meeting in July, the council voted to deny building 
permits for houses not yet begun on the undeveloped portions of the 96 acres 
and to sue Taylor Woodrow Homes for damages to the land, part of which already 
holds houses. City officials have said they will maintain the moratorium until 
the criminal investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The legal action Friday came four days before the Orange County grand jury is 
scheduled to begin hearing testimony concerning the land transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen James F. Krembas signed the deed to Taylor Woodrow Homes in 
February, 1988, acting then as vice president of the community service district 
that preceded Laguna Niguel cityhood. Krembas has denied any impropriety and 
said he mistakenly signed the deed in the belief that it was part of another 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Woodrow Homes executives maintain that Krembas' signature was only 
ministerial. They say the transaction was legal and approved by the Orange 
County Planning Commission after "hundreds of hours of community meetings, 
discussions and public hearings." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel City Manager Tim Casey said Friday that the company's suit was 
"not unexpected," although he said he was unaware of a 90-day statute of 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel Councilman Paul M. Christiansen dismissed the suit as "part of a 
public relations program" by Taylor Woodrow Homes in the days before the 
opening of grand jury hearings into the matter.

2 FIREFIGHTERS INJURED IN INDUSTRIAL BLAZE;

FIRE: SUNBIRD ENTERPRISES, A PATIO FURNITURE COMPANY, AND HP MARINE ARE HEAVILY

Firefighters battled for more than four hours Friday morning to extinguish a 
stubborn two-alarm blaze at a light industrial complex that raged through two 
businesses and injured two firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, reported at 5:11 a.m., destroyed three units in the low-slung 
building in the 1700 block of Monrovia Avenue, Costa Mesa Fire Department 
spokeswoman Susan Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been pouring water on it all morning," said Wood as firefighters from 
an engine company sprayed thousands of gallons of water on the smoldering ruins 
and caved-in roof. "They can't get it to go out." 
</P>
<P>
The fire appeared to have started in an end unit occupied by Sunbird 
Enterprises, a patio furniture company. Wood said the cause of the fire had not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was difficult to put out because flames were feeding on tall stacks of 
polyurethane foam padding used to stuff cushions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire spread to the adjoining business, HP Marine, before it was controlled 
late in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, fire officials worried that a section of the prefabricated 
building's end wall might collapse. The concrete wall, partly separated from 
the rest of the building, is supported by metal braces. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Fred Seguin was taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach for 
observation when he complained of abdominal pain after being hit with a stream 
of water, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Jeff Janzen was treated at the scene for a "tweaked knee." 
</P>
<P>
Accurate damage estimates were not immediately available, Wood said, but she 
noted that the patio furniture business was completely destroyed, while HP 
Marine sustained heavy damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's trashed," Wood said about the patio furniture business that was in the 
building's two end units. "There's nothing salvageable in there."

ICN LOSES $5.5 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCIAL: THE COSTA MESA FIRM SAYS A 47% SALES INCREASE FAILED TO BOOST 
BOTTOM-LINE RESULTS.

<P>
Blaming foreign currency losses and poor-performing investments, ICN 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. on Friday reported a third-quarter loss of $5.5 million 
despite a 47% increase in sales from the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical company's loss for the quarter ended Aug. 31 compares to a 
loss of $2.1 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
ICN's quarterly sales soared to $62.6 million, up 47% from $42.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
ICN said the third-quarter results were depressed by several non-cash items 
totaling $9.1 million, including a $4.5-million increase in the company's 
overseas debt resulting from a weaker U.S. dollar, said Jack Sholl, a company 
spokesman. "A lot of our publicly outstanding debt is in Swiss francs and Dutch 
guilders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another major factor, Sholl said, was a $1.5-million decline in the value of 
the company's investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa firm said that ICN Biomedicals, its 80%-owned biotechnology 
research and medical diagnostics subsidiary, and SPI Pharmaceuticals, its 
89%-owned pharmaceutical marketing subsidiary, registered record third-quarter 
sales. The company attributed the sales increase at ICN Biomedicals partly to 
its November, 1989, acquisition of Flow Laboratories, a manufacturer of 
products for biotechnology research. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Bohringer, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research in New York, said the 
third-quarter loss was higher than he expected, although he saw some reasons 
for encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
"Operationally, they (ICN) are doing much better," he said. "They are getting 
their expenses under control and have dramatically reduced their research and 
development spending." But he added that ICN is still suffering from large 
interest payments on its borrowings. 
</P>
<P>
"This company has disappointed repeatedly," he said, "and I think investors are 
waiting for convincing signs of an upturn." 
</P>
<P>
ICN stock closed Friday at $2.75 per share, down 12.5 cents in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, ICN has lost $13.5 million on sales of 
$196.5 million, contrasted with earnings of $3.8 million and sales of $129.6 
million for the year-earlier period.

LINCOLN S&amp;L 'WHISTLE-BLOWER' GETS KEY PROMOTION; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: WILLIAM K. BLACK, THE FEDERAL THRIFT REGULATOR WHO RECOMMENDED 
SEIZING THE IRVINE-BASED THRIFT IN 1987, IS THE NEW DEPUTY CHIEF COUNSEL OF 
ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION FOR 11 WESTERN STATES. 
</P>

<P>
William K. Black, the federal thrift regulator in San Francisco who recommended 
seizing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in 1987, was promoted Friday to head the 
litigation efforts for the Office of Thrift Supervision in 11 Western states 
and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Black, 39, had been district counsel for the agency's San Francisco district, 
which covers California, Nevada and Arizona. As such, he oversaw regulation of 
Irvine-based Lincoln and told his superiors it was being run in a reckless way 
two years before it was seized. The failure of the thrift is expected to cost 
taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In his new post as deputy chief counsel, enforcement and litigation for the 
Western states, he joins two other deputy chiefs covering the rest of the 
nation and reporting directly to Harris Weinstein, the OTS chief counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Black's blistering testimony last year before the House Banking Committee 
delivered a heavy blow to M. Danny Wall, the former OTS director. Wall resigned 
after Black detailed how his superiors ignored his recommendations and removed 
him from the Lincoln case. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Black also laid part of the blame on five U.S. senators who 
went to bat for Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., who made campaign 
contributions to them. 
</P>
<P>
The notes he took at an April, 1987, meeting with the five senators -- now 
dubbed the Keating Five -- has become a key document in the Senate Ethics 
Committee investigation of the politicians, who include Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
As a "quintessential whistle-blower," Black risked his job to speak out against 
Wall, said Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 
which was replaced by the OTS in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The West Coast is not big enough for Bill," Gray said. "He should be put in 
charge of the litigation effort for the entire United States." 
</P>
<P>
Black joined the bank board in Washington in 1984 as litigation chief. Black 
also helped push through rules and legislative bills that started to 
re-regulate an industry they believed was getting out of control under 
deregulation laws of the early 1980s. Black moved to the San Francisco office 
in early 1987.

Cirque du Soleil, the popular contemporary circus troupe from Canada, is 
scheduled to appear here next spring as part of the Irvine Arts Festival, 
actually a series of events organized by city officials starting in two weeks 
and taking place over several months. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's Gloria Newman Dance Theatre will launch the festival Oct. 28 at 
2 p.m. with an outdoor presentation that -- like all the events except Cirque 
du Soleil -- will be free. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled are: 
</P>
<P>
* The Mums, performers of magic and acrobatics (Nov. 10). 
</P>
<P>
* We Tell Stories, actors who draw from Afro-American, Japanese and Mexican 
folklore and literature (Dec. 8). 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles Poverty Department, a troupe of homeless performers (Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
* "The Play in Art," an exhibit organized by the Irvine Fine Arts Center 
featuring contemporary artists influenced by theater (March 1-April 28). 
</P>
<P>
* Peter Phillips and Friends, performance artists (March 9). 
</P>
<P>
The Cirque du Soleil date, location and ticket prices will be announced. All 
other events will take place at Heritage Park, Walnut and Yale streets. 
Information: (714) 724-6684. 
</P>
<P>
The $20,000 festival is the brainchild of Henry Korn, the city's newly 
appointed Cultural Affairs Division manager, according to Toni McDonald, 
division superintendent. McDonald said the series is being offered to celebrate 
recent accomplishments, particularly "three big ones that we're very proud of." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Irvine established a Cultural Arts Commission. In June, the Irvine 
Fine Arts Center celebrated its 10th anniversary, and this month, the 756-seat 
Irvine Barclay Theatre for performing arts opened at UC Irvine.

SINGING DIO'S PRAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I vehemently must attack Jim Washburn's criticism of the Dio concert (Calendar, 
Sept. 26). 
</P>
<P>
Washburn's negative, anti-heavy metal mind-set makes me wonder what criterion 
The Times uses to hire hard-rock music reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
Dio's singing has never been better. He was commanding, elegant, captivating, 
(with) a stage presence unequaled by any performance I have seen anywhere (from 
Bolshoi ballet to Bowie). His diction was sharp as he sang songs that embraced 
love, betrayal or the ambiguous undercurrents of a mystical world. 
</P>
<P>
Dio has assembled talented musicians and stage designers to produce a stellar 
show molded around the general theme of his albums complete with a simple but 
sinister set, a fusillade of colored lights and, of course, a few clots of 
gelignite-type flashes. It was fun to see Jens Johansson play Bach on a 
keyboard suspended by cables that shot out smoke and an explosion as it was 
hauled up and away. 
</P>
<P>
A great show. Great entertainment. Heavy metal will change and continue to 
slide surreptitiously into our society, movies, TV commercials. And I think it 
is time for critics to search out the better bands, read the lyrics and brave 
those clangorous chords, those whorls of cataclysmic angular sounds. Hold tight 
and educate yourselves. Listen to Dio, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Metallica, 
Queensryche, Def Leppard and such.

GARDENING;

<P>
A BLOOMIN' BEAUTIFUL EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When it comes to gardening, the English are contradictory blokes. 
</P>
<P>
They meticulously file their hedges into poodle-like shapes. Then they let 
their grass grow freely, daisies and dandelions welcome. They line their 
cobblestone walkways with carefully arranged planters. Then they haphazardly 
overstuff the surrounding soil with a potpourri of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting effect is a blend of country and city, natural beauty and human 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaper Nick Sutcliffe brought that British accent to Southern California 
when he transplanted here 11 years ago. His Newport Beach-based business, 
English Gardens, specializes in the style of gardening he learned while growing 
up in villages outside of London. 
</P>
<P>
He could persuade his clients to flood their gardens with a medley of colorful 
blooms rather than confining themselves to only a few varieties. But unshaven 
lawns were not their cup of tea; folks on this side of the Atlantic like their 
front yards clean-cut. 
</P>
<P>
"That took some getting used to," Sutcliffe said. "Americans are so precise; 
we're not nearly as fussy in England. We use a combination of grasses mixed 
with moss, because of the moisture. Daisies spring up, and we don't mind at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
So Sutcliffe compromised. He mows grass short -- his only concession to the 
American way, aside from replacing plants that do poorly in this climate with 
California-friendly substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
His client Diana Sterling initially balked at the English affinity for a 
hodgepodge of multicolored flowers. "I wasn't sure if I liked it at first -- it 
looked overgrown to me," the Fullerton resident said. "But now I think it gives 
the property such a jolt of color." 
</P>
<P>
Frequent compliments from passers-by helped to confirm her reassessment of the 
English approach. "What a beautiful yard!" gushed an elderly couple walking 
their dog on a recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
"People ring our doorbell to ask for our landscaper's telephone number," said 
Sterling, who basks in the glory with her husband, Ed Sterling, a plastic 
surgeon. "Sometimes I see people snapping pictures of our lawn." 
</P>
<P>
When Sutcliffe took control of the Sterlings' yard 10 years ago, their front 
lawn was a "jungle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had junipers and Hollywood twisters blocking the house, palm trees 
everywhere -- it was too much," Sutcliffe recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He cleared out some of the trees, instead making manicured hedges the lawn's 
focus. Five-feet-tall bushes sculpted into perfect domes primly frame the 
driveway and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The dark green plants, dotted with delicate purple flowers, look like dwarfed 
trees. Actually, they are vines -- potato vines, although they do not produce 
potatoes. "It's not the nicest name," Sutcliffe complained. He uses them in 
place of the bushes native to England that founder here. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a number of years of training and pruning the potato vines every week 
to get them like this," Sutcliffe said. "Originally, they are loose rather than 
dense; gradually, they fill out." 
</P>
<P>
A dedicated non-professional could whip the plants into shape, Sutcliffe said, 
though the feat requires an eye for symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
For do-it-yourselfers, Sutcliffe recommended perennial flowers, which survive 
throughout the year -- as opposed to annuals, which are seasonal. "I can make 
gardens that are fairly maintenance-free, but the more maintenance-free, the 
more limited you are in the types of plants you can use," he points out. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterlings include in their garden numerous annuals; Sutcliffe rotates them 
every few months in accordance with the season. Pansies, ageratum, marigolds, 
petunias, blue salvia and red salvia thrive during autumn. Impatiens, begonias, 
vinca and stocks enjoy winter. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe's own home, in Chino Hills, is a good example of the English tendency 
to binge on flowers. In his compact front and back yards, more than 75 
varieties of perennials and herbs currently are in bloom -- among them, asters, 
statice, white vinca, salvia, geraniums, roses, baby's breath, Spanish 
lavender, honeysuckle and rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
He boxes the flowers inside a serpentine "dry wall," typical in his home 
country. The flat flagstones are sandwiched together with soil, allowing the 
garden's overspill to grow through the layers of the wall. "It's a very natural 
look," Sutcliffe noted. 
</P>
<P>
The abundance of flowers and plants in his small, 45-by-25-foot back yard makes 
the area appear more spacious, Sutcliffe said. And, he added, they provide "an 
atmosphere of quietude." 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe favors Marathon II grass, which has a finer blade than Marathon I. 
"Its look is the nearest you can get to an English lawn," he said.

<P>
INTERIORS: THE DESIGN AND FURNISHINGS OF AN ENGLISH HOME ARE ECLECTIC AND 
COMFORTABLE, WITH PERIOD FURNITURE AND A LIBERAL USE OF CHINTZ. 
</P>

<P>
Attention Anglophiles: British interior design -- that look of chintz, country 
colors and carefully crafted clutter -- has arrived in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
You can see it now at "the British Showhouse," one of the model homes at the 
Monaco development in Laguna Niguel that was decorated to commemorate the 
countywide Festival of Britain running through Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The house's interior is brimming with chintz, period furniture, Austrian 
festoons, damask swags and tails and antique 18th-Century pillows. It showcases 
the furnishings available from Laura Ashley in South Coast Plaza, Elija Slocum 
Fine Cabinetry in Laguna Niguel and other local suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Eggarts of Creative Design Consultants in Costa Mesa says she drew upon 
her recent experiences in England to design the model's interior. "The British 
people are sometimes seem as formal, rigid and distant, but in reality, they 
are just the opposite -- very warm," she says. "And their homes reflect that 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to convey that warmth through the use of rich woods, printed fabrics 
and furniture upholstered in warm textures. Authentic British draperies were 
used that are more ornate and heavier than the drapes we usually use." 
</P>
<P>
So what is the British interior look? It's eclectic and comfortable, and quite 
different from French Country, which is much more taut and linear. Walls are 
beamed, paneled or hung with tapestries. Wallpapers might be striped -- either 
in dark or light colors -- or painted a warm terra-cotta, apricot, yellow or 
rose. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical English home, the mood is set in the hall, which is treated more 
like a room than an area to walk through. There might be an Oriental rug or 
two, a sideboard, a grandfather clock, a gilded mirror, a plaster bust used as 
a hat stand, a side table and chair, or a bench and some idiosyncratic 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the staircase might be an old carved chest or massive table with bowls, 
potpourri or great jugs of leaves or flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The English living or sitting room is stuffed with couches, armchairs, ottomans 
and footstools wrapped in chintz, damask and broadcloth. The ceilings might be 
molded and the walls paneled. There likely will be a fireplace and gilded 
mirror or two. The density of art, plants, pottery and whimsical touches serves 
to humanize a rather grand and formal room. 
</P>
<P>
The comfortable English bedroom has a coming-apart-at-the-seams elegance. It's 
a room full of memorabilia, what Christian Dior labeled a "nanny" room. It's a 
room that has "happened" rather than one that has been formally decorated. 
</P>
<P>
The furniture might include a white-painted brass bed or hand-carved wood 
four-poster bed, a round table with a light cloth flung over it, and a desk or 
bedside tables piled with books and bottles of Malvern water. The beds might be 
laden with eiderdowns, duvets, lace coverlets, patchwork quilts and layers of 
pillows in crisp, white lace, or matching prints, florals and stripes. Bed 
ruffles and a matching fabric headboard complete the look. 
</P>
<P>
The wallpapers are usually florals, prints and stripes, with coordinating 
boarders. The windows could be covered with long glazed chintz curtains and 
blinds, festoon blinds, simple short cotton curtains, or for a delicate look, 
curtains made from voile, lace and muslin. 
</P>
<P>
English nurseries are firmly entrenched in Victorian- or Edwardian-styles. 
Typical are an old rocking chair, white-painted iron crib, battered cots and 
base or skirting boards, bright-colored walls and wallpapers. There might be a 
battered chesterfield with some of the stuffing oozing out, a rocking horse and 
a basketful of toys. 
</P>
<P>
British bathrooms receive a special touch. There might be a wide ledge around 
the bath to hold toiletries and pretty glass China. Bath and basin sides might 
be paneled in mahogany, painted, papered or tiled. Walls can be wallpapered 
with boarders, painted or stenciled. Windows might be curtained with chintz, 
cotton, voile festoons, or shaded with Roman or roller blinds, or both. There 
might be plants, pretty tiles and a colorful carpet. A free-standing, claw-foot 
tub finishes off the room. 
</P>
<P>
The English study or library is darker and more masculine than the rest of the 
house. It draws on the opulent style characteristic of Edwardian country 
houses. There might be stripped and dark-stained wood floors, polished or 
painted paneling, Oriental rugs, dark oak bookcases, a mahogany or old walnut 
desk and stuffed leather chair. Draperies might be made with damasks, silks and 
brocades. 
</P>
<P>
An English kitchen has the look of warm practicality. It will almost certainly 
contain the scrubbed wood table and dresser or hutch stacked with china and 
collectables. There will be plants and herbs on the windowsills, sturdy country 
chairs, small patterned country fabrics or chintz, cottons or lace, and light 
painted walls in yellow, white or blues. There could be hard floors painted to 
look like flagstone or limestone, a huge hand-woven rug, a series of ceramic 
jars and vases and flowers. Pots and pans and cooking utensils can be hung from 
racks and painted tiles decorate the walls. 
</P>
<P>
The English dining room has a restrained elegance with its large dining table 
and gleaming silver and crystal. The look of "pleasing decay" -- a phrase 
coined by the late British designer John Folwer -- will predominate. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room might combine items from the past, such as a mahogany table and 
sideboard, urns and wine coolers, comfortable wide-seated chairs or cane seated 
chairs, polished floors or Oriental rugs. Window coverings are dramatic, 
boasting swags and tails, or perhaps a festooned heading with cascading tails 
and trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
Walls might be paneled (or painted to look like paneling), covered in 
deep-colored hessian or some other cloth, or painted. Various shades of red, 
dark greens and blues -- colors that originally found favor in the 18th Century 
-- are still good background tones for antiques. 
</P>
<P>
The British use many wall-painting techniques. "Dragging" is achieved by 
applying a glaze of transparent color over an undercoat and then brushing the 
glaze down with a wide, dry brush. "Stippling," often used with dragged 
moldings, is a dappled look achieved on the walls with a special brush. 
"Ragging" is a rougher version of stippling, accomplished with bunched-up rags. 
The coarser the rag -- anything from cheese cloth to burlap -- the crisper the 
texture. 
</P>
<P>
Stenciling is another old English design technique that repeats a single, 
simple design. It is attractive on walls, ceilings, floors and furniture. 
Stenciling plain cotton, linen and sheets can be accomplished with fabric 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best ways to understand British interiors -- short of a long 
vacation to the English countryside and a look at some of the grand homes there 
-- is to peruse books with detailed photographs, such as "English Style" by 
Suzanne Slesin and Stafford Cliff; "The English Room" by Derry Moore and 
Michael Pick; "Laura Ashley Complete Guide to Home Decorating"; "English 
Country Style" by Mary Gilliatt; "English Elegance" by Judy Britain and Patrick 
Kinmonth; and "Classic Country House Hotels" by Carol Wright.

'SWEAT EQUITY' COULD BE THE WAY TO ENTER THE HOUSING MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Almost everyone dreams of owning one or more houses and making lots of money, 
but with the high cost of Southern California real estate, fewer people are 
able to realize such dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in pricey Orange County, where the land is often worth more than the 
structure sitting on it, there's a way to span the affordability gap and enter 
the housing market. The answer is finding, buying and rehabilitating distressed 
dwellings to sell or rent. 
</P>
<P>
So said Lance Fors and Shari Selover at a recent seminar at Rancho Santiago 
College, one of the many Southern California colleges and universities where 
they teach "How to Profit From Buying Fixer Houses." 
</P>
<P>
"Once you own three to four houses, you control more assets than 85% of the 
companies listed in the Yellow Pages," said Fors, a full-time molecular 
biologist. "Working for six years in our spare time, we have become 
millionaires." 
</P>
<P>
Fors, a research scientist at Caltech and part-time real estate entrepreneur, 
has been teaching the class with computer consultant Selover for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they have purchased and rehabilitated and rented or sold about $7 
million worth of single-family housing and currently manage a real estate 
portfolio in excess of $5 million, Fors said. 
</P>
<P>
It all began six years ago in Pasadena when the couple purchased a fixer-up 
home for Fors to live in while he attended graduate school. Fors lived in the 
house for about a year and worked on the house with Selover. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a real 'industrial strength' fixer," Fors said. "It was built in 1932 
and everything had to be done. I got a hernia by breaking up and carting away 
the kitchen tile." 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the couple rented the house and purchased another property. 
Since then, they have bought, renovated and rented more than two dozen other 
properties, most of which are in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in expensive Orange County, there are areas with great opportunities for 
future appreciation," Fors said. "But it's not easy. Only one listed property 
in 50 is appropriate. The key issue in capturing above average appreciation is 
looking for pockets in transition, areas that are changing from terrible 
neighborhoods to bad neighborhoods, from bad to OK, from OK to good, from good 
to great." 
</P>
<P>
Fors said Orange County cities in transition include Santa Ana and Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really communities that have fallen out of favor or have changed," he 
said. "It's driven by redevelopment in old areas and new mini-mansion 
development in new areas, where developers come in and start putting monster 
houses and turning what was a good area into a prestige address. It all changes 
and feeds on itself." 
</P>
<P>
The negatives in Orange County, the couple said, are high home prices and 
traffic. On the other hand, the air is relatively clean, and it's a more 
desirable place to live than areas in the Los Angeles Basin, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a struggle, but you can do it in Orange County," Fors said. "You just 
have to work it really well and know what you are doing." 
</P>
<P>
The couple categorizes fixers into three categories. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetic fixers are worn, dingy and unkept, with out-of-favor decorating. 
</P>
<P>
Outdated fixers have the hallmarks of cosmetic fixers, but these "grand old 
houses of a bygone era" also lack adequate plumbing and electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
Sleeping giants -- vandalized and abandoned wrecks -- are the riskiest ventures 
but can offer the greatest potential for profit. 
</P>
<P>
"These sleeping giants, or severely distressed properties, are usually left to 
deteriorate because the land is more valuable than the house," Selover said. 
"But if they have unusual character or style, you can move them to another 
location. We've done that four times." 
</P>
<P>
One of the best ways to find discounted properties is simply to drive around 
and look, Fors said. Other sources for fixers include probates, properties 
owned by an estate, government FHA and VA repossessions, lender foreclosures, 
out of area owners, out of area listings or homes listed in an office far from 
where they are located, and disgruntled landlords. 
</P>
<P>
"Death, divorce and debt create opportunities for win/win situations which 
allow the investor to buy properties at a discount without taking advantage of 
the seller," Fors said, adding that people in distress need to sell houses at 
the "quick sale value," an amount that is typically 10% to 15% less than market 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Fors said the major fear that keeps people out of the fixer-up market is lack 
of capital. But there are creative ways to finance properties, including 
finding a partner with working capital for the down payment or to pay the 
mortgage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An investment plan is needed first, outlining actions required to meet specific 
goals, the couple said. Such a plan should include financing, type of homes, 
length of time the property will be kept and whether the owner plans to live in 
or rent the house. 
</P>
<P>
The profit comes from "sweat equity," the idea that with one's own labor and 
creativity, there is a return of $2 or more on every dollar invested. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean you have to do all the labor yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's both the sweat and the thinking," he said. "Understand the value of your 
time. A lot of the unskilled labor, such as demo work, can be hired out at $5 
to $8 an hour. And we encourage the use of top designers and landscape 
architects. They are worth the money." 
</P>
<P>
Not all upgrades pay off, Fors said. 
</P>
<P>
It's not profitable to out-price the neighborhood with expensive upgrades, 
especially in housing tracts. Avoid "fad upgrades" such as lavender laminate 
cabinets and "extremely personal" wallpaper. And don't spend more than 10% of 
the value of the house for a kitchen remodel, unless the home is in a good 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"The number one mistake is to fix up a house to sell it to the only person who 
won't buy it -- yourself," Fors said. "To create some little artistic gem for 
yourself is not cost-effective. Don't put in custom tile or (expensive) windows 
where not necessary. Know your price range, know your market and focus on 
things that really will have value." 
</P>
<P>
Those upgrades include "curbside appeal" factors such as landscaping, designer 
doors, specialty windows and greenhouse windows and extensions. Inside, white 
walls, high-tech kitchens, master bedroom suites, interesting light fixtures 
and brass hardware pay off. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to model homes and write down recurring features because that's what 
people want," Selover said. "But buyers choose a home for its features in less 
than 5% of the cases. Emotions control home buyers' decision making. People 
have to fall in love with the house and be able to envision themselves living 
there." 
</P>
<P>
To influence emotional needs, the couple concentrates on creating a 
well-maintained, light, airy and spacious atmosphere with a sense of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
They always show houses with furniture in place to aid the buyer or renter in 
imagining living there. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very careful about how things act on emotions subtly," Selover 
stressed. "For instance, the biggest turnoff can be smell. We like to make our 
houses smell like lemon, but paint and varnish also impart a feeling of 
newness."

OCTOBER GARDENING SPECIFICS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
October is the beginning of our longest growing season and the most important 
time to plant for flower color now and through the spring. This time is known 
as the "cool season." 
</P>
<P>
Get ready to plant "cool season" annuals, "showy perennials" and spring 
blooming bulbs. Watch for these annuals as they become available at your local 
nursery: calendula; candytuft; chrysanthemum (the small bedding type); 
dianthus; English daisy; Iceland poppies; larkspur; nemesia; ornamental 
cabbage, kale; pansies; primrose, English; schizanthus; snapdragons stock, and 
sweet pea. For shade planting, watch for primrose obconica and primrose 
malicoides. 
</P>
<P>
Many varieties of "showy perennials" will be available in 4-inch pots. Plant 
these perennials (and biennials) for a jump start on permanent color in your 
garden: Canterbury bells; coreopsis; cyclamen (for shade); delphinium; dusty 
miller; foxglove; hollyhock; nicotiana; rehmannia; salvias and Shasta daisy. 
</P>
<P>
For the best selection, buy bulbs now and store them in paper bags in a cool, 
dry location until planting time. For added insurance when growing bulbs, hold 
off on planting until November, when the soil and air temperature cools off. 
</P>
<P>
Tulips and hyacinths need to be placed in a refrigerator after Oct. 15 and 
chilled for six weeks. Plant these bulbs immediately after taking them out of 
cold storage. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
. . . AND GENERAL OCTOBER CARE TIPS 
</P>
<P>
De-thatch or aerate your lawn to prevent disease and pests during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare rhododendrons and azaleas for winter by mulching heavily around their 
base with 2 to 3 inches of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
When planting bulbs, be generous with the bone meal. Place some at the bottom 
of the planting hole, add a little dirt and then the bulb so the bulb doesn't 
touch the bone meal. 
</P>
<P>
If you're thinking of planting ground cover, plant it soon. If you do it now, 
the root system will become established before spring arrives and growth 
accelerates. 
</P>
<P>
Thin camellia buds now for bigger and better blooms later. 
</P>
<P>
For beautiful red and orange color in the fall, plant a pomegranate tree or 
shrub. 
</P>
<P>
To give your yard a fresh, new look, uproot plants that have overgrown their 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Tend to your roses by removing dead wood, twiggy growth and leaves with spots 
or mildew. But don't prune them now. 
</P>
<P>
Before you plant perennials or annuals, prepare the planting bed well: Dig down 
18 inches and work in organic matter. 
</P>
<P>
For a "berry" good holiday season, plant berried shrubs for garden color and 
holiday decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Keep fallen leaves raked off the lawn and out of flower beds. Certain pests 
love to set up house under them. 
</P>
<P>
A good choice for cool-season color is the bird of paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Stop feeding garden roses now because they are heading into their dormant 
period. 
</P>
<P>
For more annual color during winter, check out fairy primroses, stock and 
snapdragons.

MASTER CHORALE AT ANOTHER CROSSROADS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: AS THE CHORUS OPENS ITS 27TH SEASON, THE SEARCH NARROWS FOR A 
REPLACEMENT FOR MUSIC DIRECTOR JOHN CURRIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 27th season of the Los Angeles Master Chorale opens tonight with 
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. A challenging monument to hope and transcendence, 
shot through with fears and intimations of war, Beethoven's Mass will be sung 
tonight in a world on the brink of battle -- and by a chorus at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
The season will be John Currie's last as music director. The beleaguered Scot 
gives every indication of departing without explaining his abrupt decision last 
year not to seek renewal of his five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
But if past developments remain opaque, sources close to the Chorale have cast 
some light on the future. The search, they say, for Currie's replacement is now 
focused on four men: locally based William Hall and Paul Salamunovich, the 
familiar Helmuth Rilling and a relatively unfamiliar Simon Halsey. 
</P>
<P>
Of the reputed short list, Halsey, the 32-year-old chorus master for the City 
of Birmingham Symphony, is probably the most unexpected name. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes with the strong recommendation of Simon Rattle," reports John Binkley 
from Halsey's London management, confirming that Halsey is a prospective music 
director. "I think it was on Rattle's recommendation that they (the Master 
Chorale) investigated him." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his work with Rattle's City of Birmingham Symphony, the 
Cambridge-trained Halsey is also chorus master for the much-recorded Academy of 
Ancient Music, and artistic director of the annual Salisbury Festival. Son of 
well-known choral director Louis Halsey and a composer, he is also the founder 
and director of the City of Birmingham Touring Opera, with which he is 
currently rehearsing a two-night reduction of the "Ring" cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Rilling, the music director of the Gaechinger Kantorei in Stuttgart and 
artistic director of the Oregon Bach Festival, is thoroughly familiar to Los 
Angeles audiences and has conducted the Master Chorale before. It seems 
unlikely that either Rilling or Halsey would be willing to abandon their 
established enterprises for the full-time residence here that has been at least 
the nominal norm, but Marshall Rutter, president of the Master Chorale board, 
suggests that solutions to the difficulty could be found. 
</P>
<P>
None of that would be a problem for Hall or Salamunovich, logical choices for 
consideration whose prominent and wide-ranging careers are locally based. 
Salamunovich is music director at St. Charles Borromeo in North Hollywood and a 
professor at Loyola Marymount University; Hall is the music director of the 
Master Chorale of Orange County and professor at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
Rutter also said the music director search would be different this time: no 
guest stints/auditions. Currie's unexpected ascension to the post in 1985 came 
in the midst of a relatively public screening. It involved potential candidates 
-- including Hall and Salamunovich, but not Currie -- in a series of guest 
conductor/audition performances. Although similar processes have served local 
orchestras such as the Long Beach Symphony well -- generating tremendous 
audience interest in the ensemble -- the Master Chorale directors decided 
against such an approach this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"We considered whether that (the Long Beach Symphony search) would be a good 
model for us," Rutter said. "But if you have prominent people, it's kind of 
demeaning to them, and we are also eager to work as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Rutter hopes that they will have somebody installed by next season, but does 
not regard that as a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good candidates and we're pleased with the progress," he said, 
declining to confirm or deny any potential candidates. "It would be premature 
to say anything further." The lesson from the previous search, with the late 
and unforeseen introduction of Currie, is that the process is never closed. 
</P>
<P>
The search for new artistic leadership takes place as the Chorale enters the 
first season in a long-range plan, developed and presented to the Music Center 
over a year ago. As projected, the season has expanded slightly, from eight to 
nine performances in the Chorale's own series, with the addition of another 
subscription concert. Subscription sales, however, are down, where the plan is 
predicated on growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're down in our subscriptions a little bit this year," Rutter said. "I don't 
know how to account for that. . . . They're definitely below our long-range 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
The organization seems fiscally healthy, however. For the 1988-89 season, it 
posted an $86,000 surplus, which slashed the accumulated deficit by half. 
</P>
<P>
Its musical health will be quickly established tonight, in the performance of 
sublime hurdles of the Missa Solemnis. It has already been applauded this 
season in Music Center Opera performances of "Fidelio" and "Idomeneo." 
</P>
<P>
The other operas this season, "Nixon in China" and "Orfeo ed Euridice," 
employed a Los Angeles Music Center Opera Chorus, separately contracted through 
the opera company. The name may have been changed, but many of the faces were 
familiar, as the new chorus relied heavily on Master Chorale singers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of scheduling conflicts in the rehearsal period, the Opera Assn. felt 
it wasn't possible for us to provide the chorus for all the productions," 
Rutter explained. 
</P>
<P>
The solo quartet tonight is headed by soprano Carolann Page, Pat Nixon from 
"Nixon in China." The other soloists are Scottish mezzo Christine Cairns, a 
frequent guest with the Master Chorale and Los Angeles Philharmonic; tenor 
Agostino Castagnola, a member of the Chorale for the last four seasons, and 
baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore, a Covent Garden singer making his West Coast 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale's own season in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion -- in addition 
to performances with Music Center Opera and the Philharmonic -- consists of a 
Scottish program with Jean Redpath, Nov. 18; a Christmas program alternating 
with "Messiah" sing-alongs Dec. 8, 9, 15, 16; a Haydn-Britten pairing Feb. 2; 
the West Coast premiere of Stephen Paulus' "Voices" on a March 2 program at 
which the Chorale will collect canned goods for the disadvantaged, and a Mozart 
program April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
One year ago the Master Chorale placed a want ad for a music director. The move 
was ordered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as part of the 
labor-certification process to enable Scottish music director John Currie, then 
starting his fourth year with the organization, to obtain permanent resident 
status and keep his job. A month later, Currie made a surprise announcement 
that he would not seek renewal of his five-year contract. The search for his 
replacement has been on since.

COSBY LOSES ROUND IN L.A. TO SIMPSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even when that brat Bart Simpson tries to be good, he's baaaad. And that's 
especially bad for Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
In the first true test of their David and Goliath struggle on Thursday night, 
Fox's "The Simpsons" came within one-tenth of a ratings point -- about 93,000 
homes -- of equaling the audience for "The Cosby Show" on NBC, the A.C. Nielsen 
Co. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But since Fox says that its programs can be seen in only 90% of the nation, 
while the other three networks reach close to 100%, "The Simpsons" actually 
beat "Cosby" in that portion of the country where both shows could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, well, Bart would undoubtedly win a popularity contest 
from even Magic Johnson. The first fresh "Simpsons" episode of the season -- in 
which mischievous Bart hit the books in an effort to pass the fourth grade -- 
attracted viewers in about 1.3 million households, a whopping 39% of all 
televisions in use between 8 and 8:30 p.m. Thursday. "Cosby" was seen in about 
829,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Since "The Cosby Show" debuted six years ago, no regular network series has 
beaten it in the national ratings for its time period. Until last season, when 
"Roseanne" overtook it, "Cosby" had been the most popular TV program in the 
country for four straight years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (numbers) are pretty good," said Peter Chernin, president of Fox 
Broadcasting Co. "Better than we expected. What's gratifying for us is that we 
beat them in every demographic group except (age) 55 plus. We won with teens, 
young adults and women and men across the board. And that's the real key for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last couple of seasons, Fox has built its successes and advertising 
revenues on appealing to younger viewers with shows such as "The Simpsons" and 
"Married . . . With Children" and has cautioned against comparisons to the 
other networks in terms of total household ratings. Fox doesn't reach as many 
homes as ABC, CBS and NBC because it has fewer and generally weaker affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
An NBC spokeswoman said that despite the achievements of "The Simpsons," the 
network was pleased with its performance Thursday night, pointing out that 
"Cosby" basically held onto the audience it has been drawing so far this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The increased competition, in other words, did not detract from "Cosby," but 
instead brought in additional viewers to the four networks, she said. The four 
network share at 8 p.m. was 84% of the total audience, more than 10% higher 
than the previous week. She also said that NBC's rating for the entire night 
was up 5% over the week before. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy here," she said. "We went up against our toughest 
competition and we made it through." 
</P>
<P>
Fox has been taking some heat recently, even from some of the producers of "The 
Simpsons," for the decision to move the network's strongest show up against 
such an established ratings hit. And in recent weeks, with fresh "Cosby" 
episodes up and running, repeats of "The Simpsons" had been getting crushed and 
Fox's entire weekly lineup, with the exception of "Married . . . With 
Children," had been floundering. Just this week, advertising executives said 
that Fox has not been meeting the ratings level it had promised advertisers and 
would have to pay them back with substantial free commercial time down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's results seemed to infuse some life into the fourth network's hopes. 
But Chernin was reserved in his assessment of the ratings and said that one 
week doesn't prove anything. Fox had heavily promoted Thursday's episode. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great start for us," Chernin said.

A QUESTION OF FAITH; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CHURCH CALLS MOVIE ABOUT A MOLESTATION SCANDAL 'DISTORTED,' BUT 
FILMMAKERS DISAGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Using terms like "distorted fiction" and accusing the filmmakers of having "an 
agenda" to make the church look bad, Roman Catholic officials and observers are 
taking sharp exception to a new HBO movie based on a 1980s sex scandal in a 
Louisiana diocese involving a priest and dozens of boys. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, "Judgment," premiering tonight at 9, focuses less on the 
molestations and more on the attempts of the bishop and his vicar general to 
cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario revolves around a family (the Guitrys, played by Blythe Danner and 
Keith Carradine, with Michael Faustino as the son) and their flamboyant 
attorney (Jack Warden), who battle the entrenched power of the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Although names are changed and events juggled, the plot closely follows a case 
that caused a sensation when it surfaced in 1984 at the Lafayette diocese deep 
in Cajun country. Father Gilbert Gauthe admitted molesting 37 children, 
including altar boys and parish Boy Scouts, and was given 20 years in prison 
without benefit of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gauthe attracted the most celebrity, seven priests eventually were 
removed and the diocese and insurers reportedly paid families more than $22 
million in settlements. The family on which the movie family was patterned won 
$1,025,000. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations were the first pedophilia case of such scope to scandalize the 
church. There have been many others reported since. Jason Berry, a prominent 
investigative reporter in New Orleans who specializes on Catholic affairs and 
is completing a book on pedophilia and homosexuality in the church, estimates 
that the church has paid between $100 million and $300 million in 100 child 
sexual settlements in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, the Guitrys join other families seeking financial settlements 
from the church, but insurance lawyers insist that the church not give the 
families spiritual solace, on grounds that that would constitute an admission 
of liability and damages would be costlier. The Guitrys are very devout but 
grow furious that the bishop and his staff had known about the abuse but kept 
giving the offending priest new assignments within the parish. They break from 
the group and hire an attorney. Then the case becomes public. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on "Judgment," Msgr. Alexander Sigur, new vicar general of the 
Lafayette diocese portrayed in the movie, referred The Times to a written 
statement that he made to written questions from Sister Mary Ann Walsh, media 
editor of the Catholic News Service. She had supplied him with a copy of the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a part of the film," Sigur responded, "is based on fact and the balance 
is distorted fiction. . . . The portrayal of the church's reaction to that 
priest's conduct is totally distorted." 
</P>
<P>
The truth, he said, is that "immediately" upon receiving notice that the priest 
was accused of committing these pedophilic acts, he was removed and "criminal 
proceedings were instituted." He also disputed how the movie "fictitiously 
depicts" the church as "callous" about the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a movie made on the events at the parish was problematic. Executive 
producer Steve Tisch ("The Burning Bed," "Risky Business") said that he and 
producers Ron Hershman and Dan Wigutow pitched the idea to CBS and NBC and were 
turned down. ABC, however, declaring itself not turned off by the controversial 
theme, ordered a script, Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
But later, Tisch said, when he asked for some assurance that "top management of 
Capital Cities," which owns ABC, would fully support the project, "a top 
network executive . . . took it to a top Cap Cities executive -- who said that 
it (the movie) is not going to happen at ABC." 
</P>
<P>
An ABC spokesman said that the project was dropped because the network had done 
two other molestation movies ("Deadly Silence" and "Unspeakable Acts") and that 
"it did not go up the corporate ladder," as Tisch described. 
</P>
<P>
Hershman, who previously produced a segment on the Louisiana parish scandal for 
the CBS news magazine "West 57th," and Wigutow then met with HBO and got a 
go-ahead when Tom Topor agreed to write and direct. Topor had written the 
Broadway play and screenplay for "Nuts," which has an incest theme, and "The 
Accused," about a gang rape. 
</P>
<P>
First-time director Topor has only seen an early "rough cut" of the film 
because, he related, he was fired late in the production after battles with his 
producers and was replaced by veteran director David Greene ("Roots," "Fatal 
Vision"). But he stands by what he saw that far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Relevant sources who were asked to pre-screen videocassettes of "Judgment" had 
many criticisms -- erroneous church liturgy, faulty legal references, a mixing 
of time frames. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime New York City news reporter, Topor agreed that some people might 
find distortions in the movie and said that he did make "certain 
extrapolations": "The question is whether I distorted its emotional essence or 
its narrative essence, and I don't believe I did." 
</P>
<P>
J. Minos Simon, the attorney portrayed by Warden, thought the portrayals were 
"excellent," but maintained that the filmmakers were "generous" with the 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
"His agony was not over wanting to tell," he said. "His agony was over the fact 
that the secrecy lid was lifted and he was exposed for the first time." He 
contended that the bishop knew about Gauthe's "proclivities" but kept 
transferring him within the diocese "to a fresh new lot of victims." 
</P>
<P>
Simon had an informant -- not a priest and not one who was blackmailed into 
helping, as shown in the movie -- who discovered diocese files which revealed 
that at least 24 priests, about one-fourth of the priest population in the 
diocese, were homosexual. This information, falling into Simon's hands, 
"jarred" the diocese and forced it to admit liability, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran reviewer Henry Herx of the Catholic News Service complained that the 
film makes no attempt at balance in treatment of the clergy, "not even one good 
priest." He commended the filmmakers for focusing on the "agonized family 
rather than the sexual crimes of the clergyman." 
</P>
<P>
The candor of the film won't offend Catholics, but they're likely to be "much 
more sensitive" to the treatment of the church as an uncaring bureaucracy, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Father Gregory Coiro, a public affairs official in the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles, found the movie priests "stereotypical and unrealistic." He said that 
while the subject should not be covered up, "I really feel that the people who 
made this movie had an agenda, and I'm sorry to say but I think their agenda 
was to make the church look bad." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the priesthood has its failures "as in any other profession. 
There's 55,000 priests in this country and a person who doesn't know this could 
very easily get the impression -- especially with (recent widely reported 
scandals involving priests and even archbishops) -- well, 'My God, the priests 
are all a bunch of perverts.' Thing is, most priests are very, very hard 
working and very, very caring and none of that is addressed. It's almost like 
all priests are guilty by association." 
</P>
<P>
Berry, who did the first in-depth reporting on the Louisiana case, said that 
while the film contained "gross distortions" from the facts of that case, a 
drama can't be held to the standards of investigative news.

MILLER, HIS FREEDOM WANING, PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard W. Miller says he tends "to eat more" when under stress, and these days 
the former Los Angeles FBI agent is under considerable stress. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 53, was convicted by U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi on Tuesday 
of espionage -- the first FBI agent ever found guilty of spying. His sentencing 
is set for Jan. 7, and he faces a maximum sentence of two life prison terms 
plus 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Until he learns his sentence, "R.W.," as his family calls him, expects to 
experience the gnawing anxiety which, he said, partially explains why about 300 
pounds now hang on his 5-foot, 10 1/2-inch frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three months of freedom," he said. "What happens after Jan. 7, I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's girth belies his personality. He appears more teddy than grizzly. In 
an interview this week, he betrayed a shyness, a tentativeness, in talking to a 
reporter. Some of this he attributed to a diagnosed hearing problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It is in such situations as this, that it really clicks in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict in the nonjury trial was Miller's second conviction for espionage 
(the first conviction was overturned by a federal appellate panel) and his 
third trial (the first, in 1984, ended with a hung jury). 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Miller again proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely not a spy," Miller said quietly. "I never was. I never will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Miller served five years in prison before he was given a new trial; it's been 
about a year since he posted bail and walked out of a Minnesota penitentiary. 
Since then, he's assisted a private detective, helped set type for a weekly 
newspaper and honed his skills as an artist, cartoonist and poet. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was interviewed in the small, comfortable Downey home of his sister, 
Maryann Deem, who sat beside him on a sofa. He spoke of the uncertainty that 
has pervaded his life since he was first accused, and he seemed haunted by his 
adulterous affair with convicted Soviet spy Svetlana Ogorodnikova -- to whom, 
the government successfully argued, Miller passed secret documents in exchange 
for the promise of $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
He called the affair with Ogorodnikova, now serving an 18-year prison sentence, 
a "dumb" thing to do and added, "It seems to get dumber as I go through the 
court system." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Miller said he believes a handful of FBI bureaucrats "without 
scruples" came down on him with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"They know who they are," he said. "I'm not going to name names." 
</P>
<P>
Then Miller's bespectacled face lit up. "I am a very fortunate fellow," he 
said. "I have so many blessings I can't count them." 
</P>
<P>
Miller explained that he was primarily referring to the fact that Takasugi, 
over the prosecution's objections, let him remain free on $337,000 bail until 
his sentencing so he could enjoy the holiday season with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Conscious of a weight problem that got him into serious trouble at the FBI, 
Miller said he has been riding a bicycle daily and even cycled on occasion 
about 12 miles to the federal courthouse in downtown Los Angeles during his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
But Albert Sayers, a retired FBI agent who hired Miller last year to work at 
his Manhattan Beach-based detective agency, said Miller sees food as an 
antidote for stress. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's stressed, he eats," Sayers, the case investigator for Miller's 
lawyer, said recently. "He'll go out and buy a gallon of ice cream and eat it 
at one sitting." In prison, at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., 
Miller developed calligraphy skills. He proudly displayed for his visitor a 
series of greeting cards he produced for fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Dearest Becky," began a Miller-designed birthday card, "We have loved, we have 
cried, we have laughed, we have sighed. And it's nice to recall in the Spring 
or the Fall, all the times we did share, all the times we did care. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Miller also is fascinated by cartoon characters. The stars of his comic strip 
closely resemble the ubiquitous Kilroy character of World War II vintage. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also developed considerable computer skills while in prison. So far, it 
has allowed him to hold a part-time $8-an-hour job on a weekly newspaper, the 
Los Angeles Downtown News, where he used a computer to lay out ads. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's publisher, Sue Laris-Eastin, said she didn't know when Miller 
was hired six months ago that "this was the R.W. Miller of this case." Then, 
one morning before his trial started, Miller asked for a private meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was going on trial and that he wanted to keep his job," 
Laris-Eastin said. "I told him it wasn't my place to decide his innocence or 
guilt." 
</P>
<P>
So Miller stayed on the job, often being dropped off by Levine at the paper's 
1st Street office after his daily court appearance during the seven-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Laris-Eastin likes Miller's work. "He's very accurate with what he does," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sayers, one of Miller's former FBI supervisors, made clear he loves Miller like 
a brother and believes he's absolutely innocent. And Sayers, too, said Miller 
performed well on the job. "The FBI doesn't hire dummies," Sayers said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's downfall, Sayers suggested, stemmed from a serious personality defect 
-- naivete. 
</P>
<P>
"He could fall in a barrel of lollipops and come up sucking his thumb," Sayers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sayers described Miller as "a kind of peculiar personality . . . a kind of a 
loner," Sayers said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was even uncomfortable carrying a revolver, added Sayers, a former FBI 
weapons instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't harm a fly," he said. "He hated to carry that gun." 
</P>
<P>
His personality also played a role in Miller's defense. His attorney, Joel 
Levine, painted a picture of a bumbling agent who, more often than not, tripped 
over his own feet. 
</P>
<P>
Levine told the court that once, while stationed at the FBI's Riverside office, 
Miller "even went so far as to be the last one out of the office at night and 
he left the keys to the office in the door when he left. And when we hear 
something like that, it doesn't sound like somebody who's an FBI agent." 
</P>
<P>
So it follows, according to Levine's closing argument, that Miller finally got 
in "over his head" when his James Bond-style mission to use Ogorodnikova to 
penetrate the KGB backfired. 
</P>
<P>
The government prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam B. Schiff, said the 
"bumbling agent" theory is his "pet peeve." 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has been pretty successful in packaging Miller in a certain way," 
Schiff said in an interview after the verdict. But the portrait that emerged 
from testimony of his fellow agents, he said, was of a capable individual who 
allowed personal problems to take control of his professional life. 
</P>
<P>
This was a reference to the fact that Miller, a divorced father of eight 
children, was being hounded with financial and domestic problems, had been the 
target of disciplinary action for not conforming to the FBI's weight standards 
and had been excommunicated from the Mormon church for adultery. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Miller's dilemma went beyond personal crises, Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miller had no plan of infiltrating anything," he said. "He was an intelligent, 
conniving individual who chose to go down in flames because the prospects 
offered by Svetlana far outweighed the prospects of serving his country." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is a Wilmington native who was recruited by the FBI shortly after 
graduating from Brigham Young University in Utah. His children, ages 8 to 24 
years, live with his ex-wife, who has remarried and resides in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Miller expressed regret over his dealings with Ogorodnikova. He said he had 
somehow got it into his head that he could emulate James Bond and 
single-handedly penetrate Soviet intelligence.

OVERDUE 'I DO'S' LAUNCH REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
He spotted her across the dance floor of a country-Western bar in Long Beach, 
and when the two-step lessons started, Ed Johnson walked up and said, "I want 
you. You're tall." 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a romance that led to telephone bills totaling more than $3,000 and 
a wedding Friday on the helicopter flight deck of the Vandegrift, a 
guided-missile frigate that was one of the first two West Coast-based Navy 
vessels to return home from the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
When Chief Petty Officer Johnson and Gail Hoover said their "I do's," it capped 
a joyous reunion, not just for the 5-foot-10 bride and 6-foot-5 groom, but for 
scores of families, lovers and friends who had been separated by the Long 
Beach-based Vandegrift's seven-month tour of duty in Middle East waters. The 
guided-missile frigate Reid also arrived Friday at its home port in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's return put an end to the anxiety that soared when Iraq invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 4, the very day the Vandegrift was to begin its journey home 
from the region. Suddenly, the crew was ordered to battle stations, helmets on 
and gas masks at the ready. The ship stayed on an extra five weeks during the 
crisis, coordinating naval air defense and interdicting cargo vessels as part 
of the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The crew and their kinfolk remembered the Stark, the guided-missile frigate 
that was struck by an Iraqi missile in May, 1987, while patrolling the Persian 
Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. Thirty-seven were killed in the attack, which 
was blamed on mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confident we were going to bring home all 209 guys alive," said the 
ship's captain, Cmdr. Chris Johnson, a Garden Grove resident. " . . . We 
weren't going to be caught sleeping for one heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
And while their families worried about the sailors, the sailors worried about 
quieter dramas back home, calling and writing to keep tabs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering if I was ever going to see him," Robert Myricks of North Long 
Beach said, cradling 6-week-old Robert Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really crazy and hectic," Trina Myricks said of their son's first days. 
Her husband was scheduled to be home Sept. 14, and junior was due Sept. 23. But 
the baby arrived two weeks early. "It was part happiness, part sadness . . . I 
don't want to go through that again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Irma Oropeza of Westminster watched her husband, Tony, hold their 10-month-old 
son. "It's great . . . I'm glad to have a baby-sitter," she said, laughing. 
"Now I can take a decent shower!" 
</P>
<P>
No one, it seemed, was happier than the bride. 
</P>
<P>
When Iraq invaded Kuwait, "I thought we were so unlucky," Gail Hoover said 
before changing from jeans into her wedding gown. "Now I think how lucky it was 
for him to be there." Other crews in the area still face the prospect of war. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover said she thought she would never marry again. She is a 37-year-old 
mother of two, and Johnson is a 35-year-old father of three. Both are divorced. 
Hoover's 20-year-old son, Tom, donned a gray tuxedo to give the bride away. 
Romance might have been on Johnson's mind from the start, but not so for 
Hoover, a life insurance saleswoman. That night in The Silver Bullet, after he 
saw her give her business card to another man, Johnson wanted one, too. "He 
said, 'I need life insurance!' " Hoover recalled. "If you sell insurance, 
that's like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
During the next six weeks, they saw each other as much as possible. On March 
15, the day the ship left Long Beach for the Persian Gulf, he proposed. She 
said, "yes," and their courtship continued by mail and by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, she has two phone bills, one for $2,600 and one for $700. One of 
their Buena Park-to-Bahrain conversations lasted 2 1/2 hours. They had decided 
on the shipboard marriage, Johnson said, "because, after all, this was a day to 
celebrate. We just wanted more reason to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, someone asked Hoover the obvious question. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I sold him the policy," Hoover said, laughing. "Now I'm the beneficiary." 
</P>

RISE IN COMPLAINTS SPURS INSPECTIONS OF VALET PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valet parking attendants, take note. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a surge in complaints from citizens, Los Angeles officials have 
stepped up their inspection of valet parking services at some of the city's 
trendiest restaurants -- and many are found to be breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if city ordinances governing valet parking were enforced to the letter 
of the law, most services would have to make major changes in how they park 
cars, or shut altogether, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody that's out there is in violation," Detective Albert Perez of 
the police Commission Investigation Division said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Stella Mattson, commanding officer of the division, said the law does not 
allow a private venture, such as a restaurant, to use public streets for 
parking. In essence, a car must be picked up on private property -- not on a 
public street -- and driven continuously on private property to its final 
parking place, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which has been on the books for about 30 years but rarely enforced, 
also requires signs advertising valet parking to be posted on private property, 
not on a public street. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant owners, pointing out that many eateries are located on narrow 
streets with little available parking, said complying with all details of the 
law is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't have valet parking, none of my customers are going to be able to 
eat lunch here," said Jayson Kane, an owner of the Columbia Bar and Grill on 
Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. "They could cripple us." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is one of several that have received warnings in recent weeks 
from police inspectors who found illegal valet parking practices. Others 
include Citrus and Patina, both on Melrose Avenue, and Qs, an upscale billiard 
parlor on Wilshire Boulevard, Mattson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is loaded with celebrities," Kane said, ticking off a list of 
names. "They love our restaurant and never had a problem with the valet 
parking. And then you get hit with this." 
</P>
<P>
Kane said the attendants who work at the Columbia Bar and Grill pick up diners' 
cars on the curb in front of the restaurant and then drive them to a private 
parking lot that Kane and his partners purchased five years ago. The attendants 
do not park the cars on public streets, Kane said, yet the mere use of the 
street to go to the lot is, technically, a violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
None of the restaurants has been fined. Police said that if warnings are 
ignored, citations could follow and a parking service could be shut down for 
repeated violations. 
</P>
<P>
Mattson said her office in the last month or so has been receiving numerous 
complaints from Los Angeles residents regarding valet parking services at 
restaurants on the Westside, in the Valley and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints have ranged from attendants who drive recklessly or double park, 
to the use of residential streets to park the cars, Mattson said. Few people 
realize, she said, that the person who turns his or her car over to a valet is 
liable if it hits a pedestrian or crashes into another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Several restaurant owners contacted the offices of City Councilman Michael Woo, 
who represents Hollywood, when they learned of the new enforcement effort. In 
response, police and other officials have agreed to review the ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brueggemann, Woo's senior field deputy, said the law may be outdated and 
impractical in today's Los Angeles, and may have to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not advocating that it's OK to double park and screw up traffic, but 
the simple pulling up to a curb, getting out and going into a restaurant is not 
a hazard," she said.

MEDICARE BILL CONTROVERSY SHUTS UCLA CANCER UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RED TAPE AND MISCOMMUNICATION ARE BLAMED FOR THE CLOSING OF A 
SOPHISTICATED NEUTRON THERAPY CENTER, ONE OF JUST FOUR IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A sophisticated neutron therapy facility at UCLA, built with nearly $17 million 
in National Cancer Institute money and offering superior treatment for certain 
cancers, has been shut down because another federal program -- Medicare -- has 
refused to pay patients' bills, UCLA officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is one of only four of its kind in the country. The three others 
-- in Houston, Seattle and Chicago -- all receive Medicare reimbursement for 
patient care, according to UCLA officials, who blame the situation on poor 
judgment by Medicare's fiscal agent for Southern California, Transamerica 
Occidental Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Transamerica blames poor communication by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that Medicare patients in need of neutron therapy now must 
go out of state for care while a facility built and operated with public money 
sits virtually idle on the campus of the Wadsworth Veterans Administration 
Hospital in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The situation may be short lived -- Transamerica officials say they have 
changed their minds and are now trying to work out the terms of payment with 
UCLA. But it is illustrative of a larger issue involving the Medicare program, 
which currently gives local carriers broad discretion in deciding coverage, 
leading to great variation in the services available to Medicare patients from 
one state or region to another. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Gail R. Wilensky, administrator of Medicare's 
parent agency, the Health Care Financing Administration, said she is "very 
concerned" about the UCLA case and others like it that reflect inconsistencies 
in Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Wilensky said she is convening a task force to report in six months on 
mechanisms to increase Medicare's control over local carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"My distinct sense is that what we are going to recommend is not what it looks 
like today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare's willingness to pay was a make-or-break issue for UCLA's A. Frederick 
Rasmussen Neutron Therapy Facility. Nearly 75 of the 100 patients treated 
annually were over 65 and therefore insured by Medicare. Overhead costs were 
about $100,000 a month, said Dr. C. Michele Burnison, co-director of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on advice from the Southern California Radiation Oncology Society in 
early August, Transamerica reached an internal decision to pay for neutron 
therapy in early September, said Stanley Friedman, the company's manager for 
professional and beneficiary services. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officials say they received a letter to that effect on Sept. 28 -- the day 
the facility was shut down. It was too late to stop the closure, and the 
payment the letter proposed was inadequate, according to Dr. Robert G. Parker, 
chairman of radiation oncology at UCLA. Parker, a neutron therapy expert, has 
supervised the UCLA facility since its groundbreaking in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Fast neutrons are generally used on large tumors that are not likely to respond 
to conventional radiation. It is, for example, the superior treatment for 
advanced, inoperable salivary gland cancer, said the National Cancer 
Institute's director of radiation research, Dr. John E. Antoine. At one point, 
Antoine said, he wrote to Transamerica on UCLA's behalf to try to persuade the 
carrier of the appropriateness of Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Neutron therapy also appears to work better than conventional radiation on 
advanced prostate tumors, although the data is still being analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Because it delivers a more powerful irradiating jolt to the tumor, and is able 
to kill cancer cells in any stage of reproduction, the therapy is also 
considered promising for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 
melanomas, sarcomas and some thyroid and renal cancers. 
</P>
<P>
A drawback of neutron therapy is that it damages nearby healthy cells in a way 
that prevents them from fully recovering. Conventional radiation also damages 
surrounding non-cancerous tissues, but not their recuperative powers. As a 
result, neutron therapy is not appropriate for tumors in the brain or spinal 
cord. And those administering it must be highly skilled in targeting the beam. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA facility began treating patients in July, 1986. Simultaneously, Parker 
said, the facility began negotiating with Medicare and other insurers for 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Some private insurers paid, but because Transamerica repeatedly denied claims, 
the cost of treating Medicare patients had to be subsidized by the facility's 
National Cancer Institute research grants, he said. These ran out in September, 
necessitating the closure. 
</P>
<P>
The university officially describes the facility's closing as "temporary, while 
reimbursement arrangements are being worked out." 
</P>
<P>
But Burnison, the co-director, said it will not be easy to reassemble the staff 
necessary to run the key piece of machinery, a high-energy cyclotron. Some 
employees have found jobs elsewhere, she said, anticipating the closure as 
negotiations with Transamerica continued to be fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a big disappointment," Burnison said. "We have struggled very hard to 
hold it together over the last few months." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he is trying to keep the neutron team together by putting most of 
its members on his department's payroll. But he too is worried about 
negotiations dragging on much longer. In an interview, he spoke of exasperating 
delays and inconsistencies on Transamerica's part. When preliminary agreement 
appeared to have been reached on reimbursement early in September, for example, 
the company's follow-up letter articulated a different position, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica's Friedman blames the protracted affair on UCLA's failure to 
provide the kind of documentation that might have persuaded the company to 
reverse its position sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica's power to deny coverage comes from its position as Medicare's 
carrier for Southern California. The federal program uses local insurance 
companies to process claims and pay bills. These carriers are guided in 
coverage decisions by Medicare, but have latitude in areas where coverage is 
not explicitly mandated. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Transamerica denied reimbursement on grounds that neutron 
therapy is "investigational" -- a category that permits denial of Medicare 
payments. Transamerica did so even as carriers in Texas, Washington and 
Illinois recognized it as appropriate for certain tumors, according to UCLA and 
federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hedlund, a Transamerica senior vice president, said he would welcome 
more guidance from Medicare on coverage issues involving new technology.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACTRESS SHOT DURING FILMING AT CEMETERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A student actress was wounded by gunfire while filming a scene in a cemetery 
with a loaded gun Friday evening, Burbank police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was shot in the chest with a large-caliber pistol in Valhalla 
Memorial Park in the 10600 block of Victory Boulevard at 5:23 p.m., Lt. Larry 
Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center, where she was reported in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Her name was not released pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible as it may seem . . . they used a loaded gun" to make a film scene 
in the cemetery, Sgt. Ed Skarvana said. "They didn't know it was loaded or they 
had forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Another performer fired the pistol during the scene, and the woman was wounded 
on camera, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were questioning several people involved with what apparently is a 
student film project, but no arrests had been made. The name of the students' 
school was not known.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL FINED $42,000 FOR RADIOACTIVE 
SHIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International will pay a $42,000 penalty for shipping an excessively 
radioactive container by truck from its Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of 
Chatsworth to Pennsylvania last October, the U.S. Department of Transportation 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty "is one of the larger" fines assessed in the 15-year history of the 
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, said Ed Bonekemper, assistant chief 
counsel for the department's research and special programs administration. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was hauling six containers of contaminated equipment from Rockwell 
back to their owners. The violation came to light only because the truck 
blundered into an overpass when the driver got lost on a country road a few 
miles from his destination in Wampum, Pa.

4 LAWYERS WORKING FOR COUNTY FINED $52,000 FOR MISCONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys defending Los Angeles County from a lawsuit over a jail inmate's 
death were fined more than $52,000 for "egregious" misconduct, the largest fine 
ever imposed on a county legal team, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Haig Kehiayan ruled that Philip S. Miller, 
principal deputy county counselor, and Donna Bruce, a private attorney hired to 
help him, acted to delay the trial through "bad faith and frivolous actions." 
</P>
<P>
The delays forced the plaintiff's lawyer to do large amounts of unnecessary 
work, Kehiayan ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Bruce were each ordered to pay $22,887 to compensate attorney Allan 
F. Grossman for his extra efforts. Two other private attorneys who handled an 
appeal for Miller and Bruce were ordered to pay $3,187 for their roles in what 
the judge called "unnecessary delays." 
</P>
<P>
The county is appealing the May ruling, which imposes the largest such fine 
ever given a county legal team, Bob Pellman, senior assistant county counselor, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The wrongful-death lawsuit was brought by the widow of Stanley Malinovitz, a 
North Hollywood man who died after he was strapped to a cot in County Jail for 
40 hours, although a Municipal Court commissioner had ordered that he be taken 
to a hospital for immediate medical care. 
</P>
<P>
After two days strapped to the cot, Malinovitz died of a pulmonary embolism, 
which is often caused by lack of motion. In December, five years after 
Malinovitz's death, a San Fernando Superior Court jury awarded his widow and 
children $2.5 million. The county is appealing that verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, who represented the widow, contended in a complaint to the judge 
that, before the trial, the county legal team filed many motions and appeals 
that were "totally and completely without merit . . . for the sole purpose of 
harassing" him by forcing him to prepare responses. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bruce and Miller sought to have the lawsuit dismissed before the 
trial by arguing that Municipal Court Commissioner Charles Peven considered his 
court order "advisory." The lawyers argued that Peven would not have issued the 
order to move Malinovitz to a hospital if he had known that the inmate was 
being held in the jail mental ward. 
</P>
<P>
But the state evidence code prohibits testimony by judges in civil court 
proceedings about the intent behind a previous court order. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman also said Miller and Bruce tricked him into wasting days preparing for 
the testimony of medical experts who were subsequently never called as 
witnesses in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Although attorneys are regularly fined during civil proceedings for failing to 
appear in court or failing to provide information to their opponents, the 
nature of the alleged misconduct and the size of the sanctions in the 
Malinovitz case are very unusual, some Superior Court judges said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Counselor Robert Ambrose, however, called the sanctions 
"nonsensical." 
</P>
<P>
"No one on our team did anything that was illegal or unnecessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers filed in response to Grossman's allegations, county lawyers 
called Grossman's motion for sanctions an "unwarranted, vituperative and 
transparent attempt to intimidate, and to penalize the county, and its counsel 
personally, for vigorously and diligently defending the action." 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Bruce said they believed it was legal for Peven to testify about his 
court order, and that neither Grossman nor Peven objected to the testimony at 
the time. They also said they had valid legal grounds for every motion they 
filed, although their arguments were often rejected by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The two trial attorneys said they chose not to call the many experts designated 
as potential defense witnesses because they did not feel Grossman had succeeded 
in making points they needed to contradict. In court papers, they contended 
they should not be punished for this "legal tactical decision" made during the 
trial and should rather be "praised for not lengthening the case."

REDS MIGHT HAVE SPEED TO TEST THE A'S; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL PLAYOFFS: TWO SCOUTS FROM THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES SAY CINCINNATI MATCHES 
UP WITH OAKLAND BETTER THAN SOME PEOPLE THINK. 
</P>

<P>
The prevailing sentiment in baseball is that no team can beat the Oakland 
Athletics. But according to two top Baltimore Oriole scouts, the Cincinnati 
Reds might stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reds are the one club that has the closest ingredients," said Goldsberry, 
the special assistant to Oriole General Manager Roland Hemond who served as 
Chicago Cub farm director from 1981 to '87. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm referring to speed, forcing the game, using the hit-and-run. You've got to 
force the game with Oakland. You can't sit back and let things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Boston didn't have those kinds of attributes. They play fairly solid defense, 
but they don't have the speed. I think Cincinnati matches up pretty well with 
Oakland, as far as talent at positions." 
</P>
<P>
Goldsberry, a high-level major-league scout, has seen both the Reds and A's on 
several occasions this season. Cox, the Orioles' West Coast supervisor, was 
Cincinnati scouting director in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're going to out-ability Oakland, but for me Cincinnati has 
an interesting ballclub," Cox said. "I think if they get in this, they've got 
as good a chance as anybody to do some damage." 
</P>
<P>
Goldsberry and Cox envision a Series in which Oakland's opponent will try 
desperately to gain the lead in the early innings in order to neutralize the 
A's vaunted bullpen, led by Dennis Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
Such a scenario can work only if a team has enough speed to create runs on 
sheer aggression, and only if a team has a bullpen deep enough to thwart 
Oakland once its lead is secured. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati has both, to a greater extent than the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bonds stole 52 bases for the Pirates, but Andy Van Slyke was next on the 
club with 14. The Reds had four players finish with 20 or more steals -- Barry 
Larkin, Billy Hatcher, Eric Davis and Chris Sabo. 
</P>
<P>
As far as bullpens, Goldsberry believes the Nasty Boys -- Norm Charlton, Rob 
Dibble, Randy Myers -- give the Reds even more depth than Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Boston relievers allowed 11 earned runs in their first 6 1-3 innings against 
Oakland. That matches the total allowed the active members of the Cincinnati 
bullpen since Sept. 9 -- a span of 63 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But first things first: Taking the lead. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be easy for the Reds, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while they can go toe-to-toe," Cox said. "Eric (Davis) can hit 
the ball as far as (Jose) Canseco when he gets the bat head out. (Paul) O'Neill 
is capable of hitting balls out. Sabo is capable of hitting balls out. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is, they can't play dumb and beat these guys. Oakland has shown 
they're capable of playing a couple of different brands of baseball. You've got 
to pull out all the stops and don't stand toe-to-toe. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a sound way of playing the game anyway. I think they have to be as 
aggressive as they can be without being dumb. There is a difference. But you 
really have to go get 'em. If you sit back and try to do it with a three-run 
homer, you're going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
Goldsberry said bunting could be a key -- the Reds have several players who 
possess that skill, and "that might take away from some of Oakland's game" by 
distracting its pitchers. Hit-and-runs also would be critical, as would moving 
runners over. 
</P>
<P>
Anything, in other words, to push a run across. 
</P>
<P>
The flaw in the theory, of course, is the A's starting pitching, which posted a 
1.23 ERA in the four-game sweep of Boston. Dave Stewart and Bob Welch probably 
could pitch five of the seven games, with Mike Moore and Scott Sanderson 
working the other two. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' top two starters, Tom Browning and Jose Rijo, combined for 29 wins -- 
just two more than Welch. But both are highly regarded by Goldsberry and Cox, 
as is Friday night's Game 6 pitcher, left-hander Danny Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those guys (on Oakland) are low-ball hitters," Goldsberry said. "Rijo's 
a fastball pitcher, and he pitches up quite a bit. He would give them a good 
run for their money. I feel the same way about Jackson -- hard sliders and 
fastballs in on right-handed hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch the Oakland club hit," Goldsberry said. "Almost all of them stand on top 
of the plate. People try to pitch them away. I think you have to pitch them 
hard inside, and use any soft stuff down in the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as Cox said, is that the A's find so many ways to win. They 
outscored Boston, 20-4, without a home run or major contributions from three of 
their most dangerous offensive players -- Canseco, Rickey Henderson and Mark 
McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
On top of all that, they play suffocating defense, though Goldsberry said they 
are vulnerable up the middle without shortstop Walt Weiss, who is doubtful 
because of a strained left knee. Catcher, Goldsberry added, is their weakest 
overall position. Yet Terry Steinbach led the club with a .455 batting average 
against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said: "Oakland has an aura about them that they can't be beat." The Reds 
indeed match up well, he said, and they also play sterling defense. Yet Cox 
remembered, "What they did not do real well when I was over there was play 
quality fundamental baseball day in, day out." 
</P>
<P>
That appears to have changed, especially in these playoffs. But even if the 
Reds beat Pittsburgh, they will enter the World Series a decided underdog. It 
would take a mammoth effort to defeat Oakland, an inspired effort, a flawless 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
No question, it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
"But man," Goldsberry said, "it's tough."

STANFORD NOW HAS THE EDGE; 
</P>
<P>
USC: THE CARDINAL, COMING OFF UPSET OF NO. 1 NOTRE DAME, WILL TRY TO END THE 
TROJANS' DOMINANCE TODAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
USC hasn't beaten Notre Dame in eight years. Stanford did it last week. 
</P>
<P>
That alone should be enough to motivate USC, which has a 14-game unbeaten 
streak against the Cardinal going into today's game at Stanford Stadium, where 
USC has lost only once in the last 34 years -- and not since 1970, when Jim 
Plunkett was a Stanford senior. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford is 2-3 overall and 1-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, but its record 
belies its abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal lost to Colorado in its opener, 21-17, when Eric Bieniemy scored 
on a one-yard, fourth-down run with 12 seconds left. It lost to UCLA the next 
week at the Rose Bowl, 32-31, when Brad Daluiso kicked a 21-yard field goal 
with one second to play. 
</P>
<P>
USC (4-1, 1-1) is still expected to extend its winning streak in the 
69-year-old stadium to 11 games, but not without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"This game means everything to us," USC Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, a loser against San Jose State two weeks ago, stunned No. 1-ranked 
and previously unbeaten Notre Dame, 36-31, last Saturday at South Bend, Ind., 
ending a 12-game winless streak on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal boasts a variety of offensive weapons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Jason Palumbis, his injured right shoulder surgically repaired 
last November, has discovered after sitting on the bench last season that he 
can still throw. He has completed 70.4% of his passes to put him on a pace to 
break Turk Schonert's one-season school record of 67% and to challenge the 
Pac-10 record of 70.7%, set by former California quarterback Rich Campbell in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis, who completed 26 of 34 passes for 256 yards against Notre Dame, has 
been even more accurate after halftime, completing 77% of his second-half 
passes, including 15 of 17 against the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halfback Glyn Milburn, a transfer from Oklahoma, is a multiple threat and 
ranks fifth in the nation in all-purpose running. 
</P>
<P>
A sophomore who rushed for a state-record 2,718 yards as a senior at Santa 
Monica High three years ago, Milburn is among the Pac-10 leaders in rushing, 
receiving, kickoff-return yardage and punt-return yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"The (most important) addition to their team," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Split end Ed McCaffrey, who has caught 34 passes for 450 yards since 
missing the Cardinal's opener because of back spasms, leads the nation in 
receptions per game and ranks third in the nation in receiving yardage. 
</P>
<P>
A senior from Allentown, Pa., and older brother of Duke basketball player Billy 
McCaffrey, he is on a pace to break the conference one-season records for total 
receptions and receiving yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fullback Tommy Vardell, who scored on four one-yard runs against Notre 
Dame, has 11 touchdowns this season, eight from one yard out and none on a run 
of longer than eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
He needs only two more rushing touchdowns to break Brad Muster's single-season 
school record and 11 to tie a conference record shared by former USC tailbacks 
O.J. Simpson and Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Vardell, who has rushed for only 199 yards, has scored most of his touchdowns 
behind Bob Whitfield, a 6-foot-7, 300-pound sophomore tackle from Banning High 
in Wilmington who was recruited by USC, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a dominant player," Cardinal Coach Dennis Green said. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Stanford has scored a touchdown or a field goal on 20 of 22 
possessions inside its opponents' 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The red zone, as it's called, has been the Cardinal zone. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, Stanford has not been as efficient. The Cardinal has been 
out-gained in all but one of its games. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Stanford held Notre Dame to seven second-half points in overcoming a 
24-7 deficit last week. 
</P>
<P>
"They've put it all together," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
And at a bad time for USC. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC tailback Ricky Ervins, who has not participated in contact drills since 
suffering a sprained left ankle Sept. 29 at Ohio State, did not make the trip. 
He will again be replaced by sophomore Mazio Royster, who ran for 203 yards and 
three touchdowns last Saturday night in a 30-17 victory over Washington State 
at the Coliseum. . . . Backup guard Kian Ramsay did not make the trip because 
of a neck sprain. 
</P>
<P>
USC hasn't lost to Stanford since 1975, when the Cardinal won, 13-10, at the 
Coliseum. In 1979, behind quarterback Turk Schonert, Stanford rallied from a 
21-0 halftime deficit to a 21-21 tie at the Coliseum, giving the Trojans their 
only blemish on an 11-0-1 season. . . . Since 1957, USC is 28-3-1 against 
Stanford. . . . The series dates to 1905. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Todd Marinovich needs two completions to move into third place on 
USC's all-time passing list and 49 to move into second place. . . . USC's Scott 
Lockwood leads the Pacific 10 and ranks fifth in the nation with a punt-return 
average of 20.7 yards. . . . Stanford had been 0-11-1 on the road since 1987, 
before winning last week at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Dennis Green does not anticipate a letdown by his team after 
last week's emotional victory over Notre Dame. Watching USC on film sobered the 
Cardinal, he said. . . . USC Coach Larry Smith, on tight end Yonnie Jackson, 
who will replace injured Frank Griffin in the starting lineup: "The best thing 
he does is block the sweep. He blocks that as well as or better than Frank."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UNDER NCAA SANCTIONS, THE SOONERS ARE TRYING TO CLEAN UP 
THEIR IMAGE WITH GIBBS AS COACH. ONE THING HASN'T CHANGED: THEY STILL WIN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If nothing else, the Oklahoma Sooners of old were good for a scandal or two. Or 
three. Or four. 
</P>
<P>
You had your Barry Switzer. Your Boz. Your steroids. Your quarterback selling 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
You had your three R's, too: rap sheets, recruiting and the rat-tat-a-tat-tat 
of machine-gun fire at the university's Bud Wilkinson House. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard Copy" would have loved this place 18 months ago. It was an NCAA 
investigator's dream. And an Oklahoma nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a few incidents that tarnished us," linebacker Chris Wilson said. 
"Five people were trying to tarnish 100 years of greatness. That's a 
frustrating feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Now look at it. If you didn't know any better, you'd think you were visiting 
the Brigham Young campus, what with all the "Yes, sirs" and "No, sirs" going 
around. There isn't a scandal in sight, unless you include pillow fights. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, security at Wilkinson House, the school's athletic dormitory, is 
so tight, you need Siegfried and Roy to get in. Players sign "truth 
statements," the university's version of an honor system for class attendance. 
There are a dress code, a curfew and an emphasis on image. 
</P>
<P>
There is also Tom Hill, an assistant athletic director who has already booted 
at least one of the Sooners' finest recruits for ignoring his warnings about 
going to class. 
</P>
<P>
But the most glaring difference involves coaches. Gone is Switzer, the King. In 
his place is Gary Gibbs, the second-year boss who rules in a much different 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different," Wilson said. "But I guess it's like a job. Once new 
management comes in, you adapt." 
</P>
<P>
This is the new Oklahoma, all right -- the repentant Oklahoma, the 
probation-scarred and scared Oklahoma. Bland as tap water, the 1990 version of 
Sooner football continues to put distance between itself and a checkered past. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma of old did win championships, lots of them: six national and 33 in 
the various conferences the Sooners have played in since 1895. But it also 
caused controversy and embarrassment. Held up to the light by the NCAA, Sooner 
football was ultimately found to be as dirty as a dust rag. 
</P>
<P>
Upheaval followed. Switzer was forced out as coach and later wrote a 
best-selling book about it. Charles Thompson, who made the mistake of selling 
cocaine to undercover police, is serving time in the Big House . . . and wrote 
a book about it. Brian Bosworth, another ex-Sooner author, is making 
action-packed B movies. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone and anyone who had something to do with Oklahoma's downfall is gone, 
some more gracefully than others. 
</P>
<P>
And guess what. The Sooners are the better for it. This season they find 
themselves 5-0 and ranked fourth in the country. They can't go to a bowl, but 
they could win, if the stars and moon are aligned just so, another national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh. It has been done before. Just ask the soap opera-handsome Gary 
Gibbs, who earned a championship ring while spending New Year's Day, 1975, at 
home with his Oklahoma teammates. Those Sooners finished the year 11-0, 
recorded three shutouts and didn't allow any of the eight other opponents to 
score more than two touchdowns apiece. Probation kept them out of postseason 
play, but not from finishing atop the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, few Oklahoma faithful are comparing this year's Sooners to the ones 
in the 1974 season. There is no Lee Roy Selmon, no Dewey Selmon, no Tinker 
Owens, no Joe Washington on the roster in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a dominant team," said Gibbs, who played linebacker on that 1974 
team and spent the next 14 years as a Sooner assistant coach. "We're not a 
great team. We're nowhere close to where we were back in the middle '80s." 
</P>
<P>
But oddly enough, this might turn out to be the most satisfying season the 
century-old school has witnessed. For a pleasant change, Oklahoma football has 
become a good citizen, an example -- can you believe it? -- of the right way of 
restructuring priorities. 
</P>
<P>
And to think, all it took was enough misery and heartache to last another 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to re-establish credibility among the press, the fans, the 
supporters," Gibbs said. "But those things were ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a lot of headway. But I think people in this part of the country 
feel better about Oklahoma and what we stand for as opposed to people from 
afar." 
</P>
<P>
If ever there was a school that overdosed on football, this was it. Gibbs saw 
the excesses and understood the dangers of it all. He watched his friend and 
mentor Switzer get gobbled up by circumstances, some preventable, some not. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Switzer couldn't or wouldn't control the "monster," as he called 
it, that is Oklahoma football. Instead, he is now an occasional visitor to 
Sooner practices, where he stands on the sidelines and pretends there isn't a 
part of him that misses being a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange," tight end Adrian Cooper said of Switzer's appearances, "I miss 
him a whole lot. He's the primary reason for me coming to Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
In his place is the anti-Switzer: Mr. Clean. The Sooners wanted a 
disciplinarian with a heart. Well, they got him. They wanted a keen football 
mind and they got that, too. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Donnie Duncan is the man who recommended that the school hire 
Gibbs. The thought of pursuing an outsider, a big-name coach with a reputation, 
never crossed Duncan's mind. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Duncan had tried to lure Gibbs to Iowa State in 1978. Duncan was the 
coach and he needed a defensive coordinator. Gibbs was all of 24. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coaching (at Oklahoma) when Gary played," Duncan said. "Gary later came 
on as a part-time coach. From Day 1, it was obvious Gary Gibbs was ahead of his 
time. He was brilliant. He was always able to understand concepts." 
</P>
<P>
As hoped, Gibbs accepted Duncan's offer to fly to Iowa State for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: "Gary visited up there in the middle of winter," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ames, Iowa, may be a wonderful place during the other three seasons, but during 
winter you can barely feel your toes. Gibbs, who had never lived farther north 
than Norman, stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years later, Duncan offered Gibbs another job -- Switzer's. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint of leading our program, I knew that every decision that 
had to be made by Gary Gibbs would be made in the direction that we needed to 
go," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The direction is simple enough -- away, far away, from the eye of the NCAA. 
Oklahoma needs another investigation like it needs another tell-all book. 
</P>
<P>
No problem for Gibbs. For all the accusations made against the school's 
recruiting methods in the past -- and there have been many -- Gibbs' name has 
never been mentioned as a possible rules violator. In fact, so sure is Duncan 
of Gibbs' preventive efforts, he all but guarantees success. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is the same solution everywhere," Duncan said. "You have to have 
the right type of individuals in your program first. Then you have to have a 
structure that keeps them that way or eliminates them if they're not that way." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Oklahoma had neither. Switzer was a gifted recruiter, an 
ultra-successful coach and the great communicator, but he and Duncan lost grip 
of the football program. A lack of "institutional control" are the words the 
NCAA uses to describe such things. 
</P>
<P>
There are other mandates. Duncan and university President Richard L. Van Horn 
want the student part of student-athlete emphasized more. Enter Hill, who 
single-handedly is reshaping the image of Oklahoma, the football factory. 
</P>
<P>
How big a part does Hill play? Consider this: The Sooner football calendar, 
usually chock-full of game scenes and star player mug shots, took on a 
different look in 1990. Featured prominently is Gibbs, which is understandable 
enough, and Hill, the academic guru. Imagine that! 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is Gibbs who serves as the point man, the guy who has been asked to 
win games and nationwide respect all at the same time. So far, so good. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that we're in the light, that we're being watched," Gibbs said. 
"People are always going to judge us because of the circumstances of the last 
18 months. We've got to make sure that we're cognizant of that scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
No problem there. Hardly a week goes by that Gibbs isn't asked about Switzer or 
the controversy that enveloped Oklahoma football like a mushroom cloud. To each 
question, Gibbs recites a variation of the same answer he has given since he 
was hired: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He isn't Barry Switzer Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He promises no miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He will do things his way. 
</P>
<P>
Only when asked about Switzer's continued visits to practice sessions does 
Gibbs show a spark of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of him," Gibbs said. "This program, these kids . . . this is part 
of Coach Switzer." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Gibbs is back to being Gibbs: calm, reserved and -- how does one 
put this tactfully? -- dull. 
</P>
<P>
Watch Gibbs on his weekly show and you see a man who would rather be cleaning 
his attic than looking into a television camera. News conferences aren't much 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Married for 14 years, father of two daughters, Gibbs could start now and never 
be half the hell-raiser Switzer was. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe I've seen Gary do anything crazy," Duncan said. "But Gary 
knows who he is. He knows he's not a comedian. He knows he has been handed one 
of the top football traditions in the country." 
</P>
<P>
And isn't that the point? 
</P>
<P>
Today's game against longtime rival Texas will be another indication of how far 
the Sooners have progressed under Gibbs. Already this season, Oklahoma has 
beaten UCLA, Pittsburgh and Oklahoma State, along with Tulsa and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gibbs, who led the Sooners to a commendable 7-4 record in 1989, warned 
that Oklahoma is operating under some distinct disadvantages, as designed by 
NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Oklahoma arrived in Dallas Friday with only three sound 
linebackers and three defensive ends. With only 80 players on scholarship, as 
opposed to the usual 95, Gibbs is scrambling for replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're No. 4 in the country, but anybody who thinks that we're back and that 
we're not going to have hard times again is fooling themselves," Gibbs said. 
"We've got a long ways to go before we can get our program back to where we're 
comfortable with the talent and the numbers and the depth, given the kind of 
schedule we'll be playing." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue might disagree. Oklahoma beat his Bruins, 34-14. The 
next week, the Sooners trounced Pitt, 52-10. At the time, Pitt was ranked No. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Sooners are winning with their running game. Fullback Kenyon 
Rasheed, who wasn't even a starter when fall practice began, is averaging 
nearly six yards a carry. Quarterbacks Steve Collins, the starter, and Cale 
Gundy, the occasional replacement, give Oklahoma the semblance of a passing 
game, a rarity in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
And as you might expect, the Sooners' defense is solid. Remember, Gibbs is the 
team's former defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a strange, trying journey back to respectability for Oklahoma. 
Given their druthers, Gibbs and his players probably would like to forget the 
sins of the past. But nobody is in a hurry to let them -- not Duncan, not Van 
Horn, not the NCAA, not the media. Maybe it's better that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were dark days," said Cooper, the senior tight end. 
</P>
<P>
But they're getting brighter. At last.

MELVIN DURSLAG: CLEMENS AGAINST COONEY: UNCIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
We are reaching that point in society where people in jail may soon outnumber 
those outside. 
</P>
<P>
Retail business will complain. 
</P>
<P>
"The holiday season is make-or-break," a merchant will groan. "Now Christmas is 
coming on and so many prospective shoppers are in jail that we may not be able 
to keep our doors open." 
</P>
<P>
Jail population is swelling from new areas, led by savings and loan chiefs and 
junk-bond dealers. Disrespect for law is becoming such that not even people who 
double-park want to answer for it. 
</P>
<P>
You give them the horn and they give you the digital salute. 
</P>
<P>
Even in pursuits as frivolous as baseball, disrespect for authority filters 
down. You see growing evidence of this today in a game in which players and 
managers are kicked out at startling rates. 
</P>
<P>
With disbelief, you see the starting pitcher of Boston kicked out of a playoff 
game the other day in the most critical of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
His team is down, 3-0, in the series. It is the second inning. He doesn't agree 
with the umpire's judgment on balls and strikes. He cusses him out. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire, who has no history of shooting from the hip, gives him the foot. If 
he doesn't give him the foot, he is inviting verbal mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant in the case, Roger Clemens, is no thug. He is an outstanding 
pitcher who, like too many of his colleagues, has lost his way, forgetting that 
others on this earth have dignity, too. 
</P>
<P>
The umpire who boots him, Terry Cooney, is 57, or old enough to be the father 
of Clemens, who is 28. Umpiring most of his adult life, Cooney worked up from 
the minors, joining the American League in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Need he be cursed by one the age of Clemens? 
</P>
<P>
For every act of disobedience on this earth today, there appears to be an 
apologist. In the case of Clemens, one apologist points to the pressure of the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Another tries to explain that cursing someone from 60 feet away isn't like 
cursing him eyeball-to-eyeball. 
</P>
<P>
Employing that logic, one wants to dismiss any threats of Saddam Hussein, 
because he is 6,000 miles from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever defense one wishes to construct for Clemens, let one be reminded that 
Sandy Koufax never got himself kicked out of a postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
Whitey Ford never got kicked out. Nor did Warren Spahn, Jim Palmer, Catfish 
Hunter or Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale had a hot head, but it wasn't empty. He never got kicked out in 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Umpire Cooney may as well go off the pier if he allows a kid in his 20s, 
however successful, to cuss him out. 
</P>
<P>
His embarrassment in the playoffs will have a sobering impact on Clemens. 
Before mouthing off next time, he will remember what happened in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
You know, of course, that laser equipment is available today that would remove 
from the umpire the responsibility of calling balls and strikes, the most 
overriding cause of baseball arguments. 
</P>
<P>
With the laser, the strike zone is clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
But baseball rejects modern technology, including instant replay, even though 
baseball is a tidier game than football, making judgments by the camera 
generally more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
When the subject of instant replay in the major leagues last came up, Peter 
Ueberroth, then commissioner, told your venerable correspondent: "The umpire is 
part of baseball's romance. He is a professional who, before coming to the 
majors, has spent years in the minors. He has paid his dues. To overrule him 
with a camera would be an affront to his dignity." 
</P>
<P>
"What about overruling an ump if he is wrong?" Ueberroth was asked. 
</P>
<P>
He answered: "Aren't we surrounded by enough technical progress without 
introducing it to our sports, too?" 
</P>
<P>
So, among commissioners, the line of succession has a consistent following, and 
the game continues without technical assistance, all the more reason why those 
who play and those who manage have a commitment to civility. 
</P>
<P>
Can you picture athletes, miffed by Clemens' ejection, throwing drums of 
Gatorade out on the field? Defending their pitcher's right to call an umpire 
names, they may progress from Gatorade drums to hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Red Sox are looking for an ear of compassion, they aren't going to 
find it here. Nor will anyone else in sports trampling on the self-respect of 
those in his precinct.

CLIPPERS GIVE HARPER GUARANTEED 4-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers, facing the rare situation of negotiating with an injured free 
agent, signed Ron Harper to a four-year guaranteed contract worth more than $11 
million Friday because they view him as a rare talent. 
</P>
<P>
Although no details were disclosed, the Clippers have made a bold move by 
guaranteeing the majority of the money to a player who must again prove his 
talents after undergoing reconstructive knee surgery on Jan. 23. This season, 
for example, it is believed that Harper will earn more than $2 million although 
he is expected to miss almost half the campaign. January is the target for his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron is a superstar, and the challenge was to pay him as a superstar while 
still addressing the risks involved in this situation," said Bob Steele, chief 
executive officer of the Sterling Corp. and the team's negotiator. "The truth 
is, we recognize Ron as one of the very top players in the NBA and we are going 
to pay him accordingly on a guaranteed basis. That's the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few players in the NBA would ever get a guaranteed contract in this 
situation. But Ron is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The deal, completed after three months of negotiations devoid of rancor, 
includes incentives for games and minutes and performance bonuses such as 
making the All-Star team and All-NBA. More important, there are no medical 
contingencies for a minimum number of games that might lessen Harper's pay. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the culmination of a long process made very complicated because of the 
status and the stature of the player involved," said Mark Termini, Harper's 
agent. "Those two facts made this very, very complicated negotiations, one for 
which we -- the Clippers and I -- could find no precedents. We went onto new 
ground when we structured this one." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers apparently accepted the risk because of what Harper means to the 
franchise. He averaged 23 points for 28 games after arriving last Nov. 16 as 
part of the package that sent Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny Ferry to 
the Cleveland Cavaliers. The flair that came, too, was a bonus for a marketing 
department trying to sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Harper earned $650,000 then, in the final season of a four-year contract he 
signed after the Cavaliers made him the eighth player drafted. The Clippers 
were not fazed by trading for someone who would soon be a restricted free agent 
and said from the start they would match any offer sheet Harper signed. They 
never had to exercise that right of first refusal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of faith that they asked me to sign a four-year deal," said 
Harper, who has not had any setbacks in the rehabilitation of his injured right 
knee. "If they had no confidence in my return, they would have asked for only a 
two-year deal." 
</P>
<P>
After a hectic 11 days that included signing Harper and first-round draft 
choices Bo Kimble and Loy Vaught and deciding not to match the offer sheet Joe 
Wolf got from the Denver Nuggets, Clipper negotiators will get a rest until 
mid-November. Then, talks will begin on a long-term deal for Benoit Benjamin, 
about to begin the option year of his contract.

NEWSWIRE: DREXLER WILL EARN $8 MILLION IN 1995-96 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers have given guard Clyde Drexler an extension on his 
contract that he said will pay him more than $8 million for the 1995-96 season 
-- believed to be the highest single-season salary for an athlete in a team 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler, 28, signed the agreement Friday in Honolulu, where the Trail Blazers 
played an exhibition game against the Lakers Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fair contract," Drexler said. "I'm happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler is the Trail Blazers' all-time leading scorer and a third-team NBA 
all-star last season. He will earn about $1.2 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers promised Drexler they would boost his pay a year ago. Because 
of NBA salary cap restrictions, his salary couldn't be increased immediately, 
so Blazer officials negotiated a one-year extension with a balloon payment.

CARSON'S WALSH HOBBLES BANNING; 
</P>
<P>
COLTS: DESPITE ANKLE INJURY, HE BREAKS SCHOOL RECORD WITH 407 PASSING YARDS IN 
41-14 VICTORY.

After not being expected to play because of an ankle injury, Carson quarterback 
John Walsh passed for four first-half touchdowns to lead the Colts past 
Wilmington Banning, 41-14, Friday night before a crowd of about 8,000 at 
Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who was injured in Carson's 56-0 victory over Gardena a week ago, 
completed 18 of 28 passes for 407 yards, breaking his school yardage record, to 
lead Carson to its sixth consecutive triumph over its neighborhood rival. 
</P>
<P>
In its last three victories over Banning, Carson has outscored the Pilots by a 
combined score of 137-21. Carson leads the series, 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Walsh, who completed nine consecutive passes during one stretch, Carson 
took a 33-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
On three consecutive plays in the first quarter, Walsh connected on touchdown 
passes of 10, 46 and 16 yards respectively to Abdul Muhammad, Latario Rachal 
and Donnell Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Rachal led Carson with six catches for 114 yards, Adams had four for 49, 
Muhammad four for 87 and Theron Hill three for 60. 
</P>
<P>
Carson was moving through the air with ease in the first half, Banning 
quarterback Anthony Nicholson completed only one pass in five attempts for 
minus-five yards and threw two interceptions to Tarriel Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright spot for Banning was tailback Travis Davis, who rushed for 158 
yards in 25 carries with 166 yards gained in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Davis set up the Pilots' first score by gaining 53 yards during a 62-yard 
second-quarter drive that was capped by Nicholson's one-yard run, cutting 
Carson's lead to 26-7. 
</P>
<P>
Carson finished the scoring late in the first half on an 83-yard touchdown play 
from Walsh to Fred Sims. In the half, Walsh finished with 11 completions in 13 
attempts for 265 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Banning added a fourth-quarter touchdown on a 23-yard run by Ken McKinley to 
make the score 33-14. 
</P>
<P>
Carson scored again midway through the fourth quarter on a two-yard run by 
Muhammad, his third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Carson is 4-1 overall and 2-0 in the Pacific League. Banning is 2-3 and 1-1.

A SOFT TRACK FOR ROTHMANS IS PERFECT FOR FRENCH GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rain falling in Toronto Friday didn't make Andre Fabre angry. Nor will 
Fabre be upset if it's raining two weeks from today in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Fabre trains French Glory, a 4-year-old French colt who thrives on soft turf. 
The horse is a 5-2 favorite in Sunday's Rothmans International at Woodbine, the 
suburban Toronto track, and he's likely to be an even shorter price if the 
course comes up yielding, which it probably will. 
</P>
<P>
French Glory has come to North America on a two-race mission, the main event 
being the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf at Belmont Park on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Although French Glory ran fourth in his last race, he was only 2 1/4 lengths 
behind Saumarez, who went on to win the Arc de Triomphe. Saumarez and French 
Glory are expected to meet again in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's running, the Rothmans joins the list of $1-million races. Second 
choice in the 1 1/2-mile stake is Roseate Tern, the 4-year-old English filly 
who also has the Breeders' Cup on her itinerary. If the course is too soggy, 
however, Roseate Tern might be scratched Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges Bay, the American horse who won last year's Rothmans, is part of 
Sunday's 10-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
At Bay Meadows Sunday, 10 regional qualifiers are running in the $250,000 Final 
Fourteen. The 1 1/8-mile race has drawn second-rate horses, with Tex's Zing, 
the Illinois representative, listed as the 3-1 favorite. The Final Fourteen 
doesn't have 14 horses because some of the qualifiers have opted for bigger 
things. BILL CHRISTINE

OAK TREE; 
</P>
<P>
MANDELLA IS SHOOTING FOR A DOUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four of the first six trainers in the national money standings are 
California-based, and three of them are familiar names throughout the country: 
Wayne Lukas, who is a cinch to win his eighth consecutive title; Charlie 
Whittingham, who has finished first seven times, and Ron McAnally, an Eclipse 
Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mandella, the other Californian in the top six, is well-known locally, 
and worked for a couple of years as an assistant trainer in New York, but away 
from the West Coast he would turn few headwaiters' heads. 
</P>
<P>
That could be changing. Mandella, who will turn 40 next month, has saddled 
horses that have earned more than $3.1 million, and even better days could be 
ahead. Today, he's in Lexington, Ky., to run Leger Cat in the $175,000 
Keeneland Breeders' Cup Stakes; Sunday at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting, 
Mandella's Reluctant Guest is the highweight at 121 pounds in the $150,000 Las 
Palmas Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Mandella's barn has all the momentum it needs. At the end of Del Mar, his 
horses won five consecutive races to gain him a tie with Lukas and Bill Spawr 
for the training title. Since the opening of Oak Tree, Mandella's Exclusive 
Partner has tied the world record for 1 1/8 miles on grass with a time of 1:44 
4/5, and his Corwyn Bay has earned a berth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, two 
weeks from today at Belmont Park, with a victory in the Ancient Title Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant Guest is a candidate for the Eclipse Award as best grass female, 
having won the Beverly D. at Arlington International and the Wilshire and 
Beverly Hills handicaps at Hollywood Park. The late-running 4-year-old filly 
has drawn only four opponents in the 1 1/8-mile race Sunday -- Tessia, Double 
Wedge, Royal Touch and Little Brianne. 
</P>
<P>
Mandella can identify with the Sprint, even though none of his three Breeders' 
Cup starters have run in that stake. In 1986, Mandella was training Phone 
Trick, one of the fastest horses in the country. Phone Trick had won all six 
starts the year before, and he extended the streak to nine with a victory at 
Santa Anita and two more in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Phone Trick's first loss, a second-place finish to Groovy in the Tom Fool at 
Belmont Park that July, was also his last race. Injured, he missed the 
Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita, and the Sprint was won by Smile, who had been 
beaten by Phone Trick earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Smile's total was three stakes victories, the same as Phone Trick's, but the 
Eclipse Awards voters, as they frequently do in this division, gave the title 
to the Breeders' Cup winner. 
</P>
<P>
With Phone Trick accounting for about 15% of the total, Mandella's barn earned 
$1.6 million that year, ranking 34th nationally. Mandella's horses will more 
than double the '86 purse total this year, and a victory in the Sprint might 
erase the memory of what the race did to him then. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Unless Ruhlmann or Lively One emerges from today's Goodwood Handicap at Santa 
Anita as a likely contender, trainer Charlie Whittingham will have only one 
starter, Golden Pheasant, in the Breeders' Cup. Golden Pheasant will run in the 
Turf Stakes. Whittingham, who has won Breeders' Cup races with Sunday Silence 
and Ferdinand, has been in the Breeders' Cup every year since it began in 1984, 
running nine horses in 1987. The last time the Breeders' Cup was held in New 
York, at Aqueduct in 1985, he ran only one horse, finishing seventh with 
Greinton in the Turf. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, who couldn't beat Bayakoa in last year's Breeders' Cup Distaff and 
has lost two of three meetings to her this year, will again try to beat her at 
Belmont. . . . Best Pal, headed for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, bit his tongue 
in the post parade before winning the Norfolk Stakes last Sunday, which 
explains why he bled from the mouth.

Buster Douglas, operating efficiently behind a superior left jab and quicker on 
his feet, will easily out-box Evander Holyfield on Oct. 25, win a comfortable 
decision, and retain his heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
That word comes from the guru of Las Vegas boxing, Johnny Tocco, who also 
cautions everyone not to attach too much weight to what Douglas did to Mike 
Tyson in Tokyo last February. But he does attach some weight to Douglas' 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
Tocco, 79, has trained hundreds of fighters in his 60 years in boxing, among 
them Sonny Liston. He's a tough old guy, and he runs the toughest, meanest gym 
in Las Vegas, Johnny Tocco's Ringside Gym. There, daily, he waits for some 
future heavyweight champion to walk through the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Buster will out-box Holyfield and win a decision," he said Friday. 
"I just don't see either guy taking the other out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm giving Buster the benefit of the doubt when I say this, because I believe 
he beat an out-of-shape Mike Tyson in Japan. That wasn't the real Mike Tyson he 
beat that day. You ought to look at some of Buster's other fights to get an 
angle on what kind of a fighter he is. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in Buster's corner the night (Feb. 25, 1989) he beat Trevor Berbick 
on a decision at the Hilton, and he won nine out of 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"But he never knocked Berbick down, and I keep remembering how Tyson destroyed 
Berbick (in 1986), in two rounds. I felt Buster should have knocked Berbick out 
that night. So just because Douglas stopped an out-of-shape Tyson, he hasn't 
convinced me he's a great fighter. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Holyfield, here's a slow guy with good power, but not great power. I don't 
see him putting Douglas away. I can see him using his power in a boxing sense, 
maybe making Buster respect his punch, maybe forcing Douglas to fight very 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, an unknown factor in this is Buster's weight. He was in my gym two months 
ago, shooting a commercial, and he was so fat he wouldn't let them photograph 
him without his shirt on. You know, before he went into training, he was riding 
all over Vegas in a limo with Steve Wynn and eating like a hog. Like I say, I'm 
giving him the benefit of the doubt in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
Summing up, Tocco says he's picking the better boxer but leaves himself an out. 
</P>
<P>
"Buster's got a very good jab, and if he uses it right, I don't see Holyfield 
catching him," he said. "But remember this if Buster starts to wear down, he's 
been a strong finisher in only one fight in his career, in Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
Mirage Hotel president Steve Wynn says Sugar Ray Leonard's return to the ring, 
as the ring announcer for the Douglas-Holyfield fight, came about this way: 
</P>
<P>
"Ray and I were eating a pizza at the hotel when I ran some names by him of 
people we were considering for the PA announcer's job. He heard them all, then 
said: 'A two-bedroom suite, and I'm your guy.' So I hired him." 
</P>
<P>
Odd that Leonard would work for no wages, particularly since his wife, Juanita, 
will ask at a Nov. 2 hearing that Leonard's child-support payments to her be 
raised from $12,000 a month to $50,000, according to Juanita Leonard's 
attorney, Marvin Mitchelson.

Light-heavyweight champion Virgil Hill of the World Boxing Assn. began a 
six-day, 17-city tour through his native North Dakota Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hill isn't running for office -- although some in North Dakota suggest he 
should -- he is expanding his already considerable popularity in the state 
where he grew up, learned to box and where he has fought often since becoming a 
pro champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Virgil's just staying in touch with people, and maybe making new friends," 
said his manager, Gary Martinson, before the tour began. "We'll start in 
Williston, where he went to high school, and finish up in Dickinson on 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
In between, Hill will appear at luncheons, fund raisers, dinner parties, 
training sessions and socials in Minot, Grand Forks, Fargo, Wahpeton, Valley 
City, Jamestown and Devils Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Hill has a 10-round, nontitle fight scheduled Oct. 27 in Bismarck against 
Frankie Minton. He has a mandatory title defense coming up in 1991 against 
unbeaten Michael Moorer, a fight the Forum would like to have on a pay- 
per-view show in January.

Julio Cesar Chavez will fight at the San Diego Sports Arena Nov. 6 against an 
opponent to be named. Olympic silver medalist Roy Jones will box on the 
undercard. Chavez will defend his junior-welterweight championship against Ahn 
Kyung-Duk Dec. 8 in Atlantic City. . . . IBF middleweight champion Michael Nunn 
might be box office poison in Las Vegas, but he's playing pretty well in Paris, 
according to Top Rank, promoter of Nunn's Thursday title defense there against 
Donald Curry (delayed on Showtime, 7 p.m.). As of early this week, Top Rank 
reports, 12,000 tickets had been sold for the fight at the 17,000-seat Palais 
de Sports. 
</P>

All-Heart Boxing's super-bantamweight champion, Paul Banke, has moved to 
Monroe, Utah, where he is training for his Forum title defense against Pedro 
Decima Nov. 5. Banke formerly lived at All-Heart's training camp at Quail 
Valley. The club has another training facility in Monroe. . . . The World 
Boxing Hall of Fame will hold a stag roast Wednesday for former fighter Art 
Aragon at the Los Angeles Marriott. Tickets: (213) 699-0904, (213) 723-8471.

Forum boxing publicist John Beyrooty is reaching when he claims it is "a record 
that will last as long as Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak," but it's a 
fact that when Mike Phelps of Dallas boxes Oct. 22 in the Forum's bantamweight 
tournament, it will be his third bout in the first round of the eight-boxer 
tournament. It happened like this: Phelps was stopped by Jose Luis Vega-Gil in 
the tournament's first round last July, but because Vega-Gil had not made 
weight, it didn't count as a tournament fight. Phelps next boxed Cesar Soto to 
a draw and it was decided that Phelps and Soto would box again Oct. 22 in a 
five-round bout -- Phelps' third opening-round bout. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Zaragoza, whose doctor ordered a postponement of his Oct. 8 rematch with 
Banke at the Forum when Zaragoza complained about severe headaches, has been 
cleared to fight and the Forum hopes to put Banke-Zaragoza III back together 
for December or January.
