PROPOSITION 141; 
</P>
<P>
WARNING SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toxic chemicals discharged into our drinking-water supplies are a serious 
problem. Four years ago voters approved Proposition 65, which imposed stringent 
regulations on the release of substances believed to cause cancer or birth 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
There was one hitch, though: The new rules only applied to the private sector 
-- not to public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
A yes on Proposition 141 would change that by extending certain requirements of 
Proposition 65 -- The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 -- 
to federal, state and local government agencies and water systems serving the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, not only is the private sector prohibited from releasing 
chemicals into drinking water in concentrations known to cause cancer or birth 
defects, it is also required to post warnings before exposing consumers and 
employees to even trace amounts of such chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 141 would subject public agencies to the notification and civil 
penalties rules. However, it provides certain exemptions to the drinking-water 
requirement. Chemicals put into drinking water for public-health purposes, for 
example, would be exempt. So would chemicals due to storm-water runoff or the 
result of a public agency's response to an emergency, such as firefighting. The 
measure would not apply to public sewage-treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of posting warnings could exceed $1 million beginning 1991, but water 
is precious to our well-being. We should know what's in it. Public agencies are 
here to serve the people, no less than business. We urge a yes vote.

SHAVING CREAM WAR: A JOKE, RIGHT?; 
</P>
<P>
WHY THE BANNING OF 16 ITEMS IS A SMOG-BUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the late Sen. Everett Dirksen once said of the federal budget, a billion 
dollars here and a billion dollars there and pretty soon you are talking real 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of smog. So the state Air Resources Board took aim last week 
at 16 liquids or lotions you can find in almost any house. With these 16 
products, California's 30 million people pump as much pollution-breeding 
chemical waste into the air every day as 20 big oil refineries or 60 small 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
SMOG PROMOTERS: Consider a common sight in California as the morning rush hour 
unfolds. A car backs out of a driveway, jets of water spraying its windshield, 
its wipers flicking away the night's accumulation of dust and grime. By the 
time that car reaches the street, it has a clean windshield, the better to see 
and avoid other cars, pedestrians, cats, garbage trucks and the like -- and 
that's good. 
</P>
<P>
What's bad, as the Air Board said last week, is that the air is now a little 
bit dirtier. Windshield-washer fluids that drivers mix with water to help the 
wiper blades brush away bugs and other debris is known in the multisyllabic 
language of air-pollution control as a "volatile organic compound." This is 
another way of saying hydrocarbon, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon that on the 
average sunny day in Southern California mixes with oxides of nitrogen to 
create smog. 
</P>
<P>
Washing a single windshield is one thing. But there are 15 million cars in 
California. A squirt here and a squirt there and pretty soon you are talking 
real smog. 
</P>
<P>
The air board is not reaching in to snatch hair spray and aerosol shaving 
creams out of bathroom cabinets. Californians will still be able to buy 
furniture and floor polish, bug spray, kitchen cleaners and other items among 
the 16 formulas. 
</P>
<P>
The important changes will be made at the factories that produce these items, 
compelling them to do so with formulas that reduce the amount of hydrocarbons 
set loose every time the cap comes off a bottle or a spray-button is pushed. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers will spend anywhere from $16,000 to $500,000 a year more to 
produce the reformulated goods. They probably will cost consumers between a 
penny and a quarter more. 
</P>
<P>
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PAYOFF: What will that buy in terms of clean air? About 45 
fewer tons each day of hydrocarbons, according to the Air Board. Getting 
reductions of that magnitude out of major oil refineries in California would 
mean shutting down 10 of the big ones. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the Air Board in Sacramento, which will require changes in six of 
the products by 1993 and the rest by 1994, is part of a new phase of pollution 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The big, and relatively easy, targets like power plants, refineries and fleets 
of automobiles are now covered. Future gains on smog will involve tightening up 
on thousands or millions of small sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Board is absolutely on the right track. Our guess is that Californians 
may not notice these incremental changes for years -- when they take deep 
breaths or realize that they can actually see the mountains near home.

TOO SANGUINE TO BE CREDIBLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's hope Wall Street, Moody's and anyone else who's trying to figure out how 
this state will do in years to come gets to read a relatively sunny new report 
on the state economy. It's almost a cure for the recession blues -- not to 
mention a nice booster ad for the state's credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
The study of prospective federal defense cuts concludes that California's 
economy will grow more slowly for about five years but still outperform the 
rest of the country. Even if the Pentagon budget were cut by one-third, the 
report says, the state would then bounce back, stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to believe? The report was completed by the Commission on State Finance 
not long after the Middle East crisis flared and before so many economists 
began declaring that a national recession is already under way. It also 
predated the Washington "Gong Show" on the federal budget. But neither tremblor 
shook the staff's confidence in its predictions. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the report reaches conclusions similar to earlier reports on the 
impact of defense cuts, but it is the most thorough study so far, with such 
rich detail as a catalogue of retraining programs for defense workers and 
county-by-county, company-by-company totals of defense-related income. 
</P>
<P>
But, as with nearly everything these days, there are streaks of bad news among 
the good. Major California-based defense programs that face sharp budget cuts 
next year include the B-2 Stealth bomber and the C-17 military transport. Even 
without budget cuts, both are in trouble because of delays in production or 
testing. Major budget cuts could also touch other defense projects in which 
California has a big stake, such as a rail-based MX missile, "Star Wars" and 
Tomahawk cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the report says that the future looks to be painless. The state, 
which began losing aerospace jobs three years ago, will lose 101,000 of them 
before budget-cutting stops. Yet, there is a bit of good news among the bad. 
Even as it tries to cut the defense budget, Congress signals that it wants a 
strong research and development effort. California has usually gotten about 
one-third of the Pentagon's research work.

<P>
The breakdown of the budget negotiations and its consequences may be my fault. 
</P>
<P>
As a non-voter, Congress does not know or care how I feel on any issue. Well, 
things are going to be different. It is never too late to use our "people" 
power to give notice to the government. I urge all eligible citizens to get off 
their duffs and vote. This is the only way to show politicians that they have 
to take their responsibility to the electorate seriously.

THE NEW LABOR FORCE: JAILBIRDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite its superficial appeal, Proposition 139, the Prison Inmate Labor 
Initiative, is a doubly defective measure and ought to be rejected by 
California's voters. 
</P>
<P>
As penology, its central notion -- that enforced labor contributes to 
rehabilitation -- is 200 years old and long ago discredited. As fiscal policy, 
its projected benefits are entirely speculative and its potential pitfalls all 
too clear. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 139 proposes to amend the state Constitution to allow the 
Department of Corrections and county officials running local jails to enter 
into joint ventures with private companies that would hire inmate labor. The 
legislative analyst reports that these private companies "would be allowed to 
lease real property on prison grounds at or below market rates." They also 
"would be allowed a tax credit of 10% of the amount of wages paid to each 
inmate." 
</P>
<P>
Wages, at least in the state prisons, are supposed to be comparable to those 
paid free workers for similar tasks, though no benefits will be paid. The 
director of the Department of Corrections, acting solely on his or her own 
discretion, will be authorized to deduct up to 80% of the inmate laborers' pay 
to defray the cost of their incarceration and for other purposes. The measure 
leaves the terms under which inmates will be employed in county jails to be 
established by entirely unspecified "local ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
While the legislative analyst's report says that Proposition 139 "would likely 
result in net savings to the state," it also says their magnitude "is 
impossible to quantify." It also says it is impossible to calculate the 
measure's direct or indirect fiscal impact on state or local governments or on 
"the number of jobs in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
In the 18th Century, when John Howard and his fellow English reformers 
conceived the modern penitentiary, they thought forced labor would be one of 
its pillars. That -- along with another of their precepts, universal solitary 
confinement -- soon was abandoned because it was ineffective and, invariably, 
subjected the inmates to abuse. There is no reason for California to repeat 
their failed experiment, especially since even if it succeeds, it will do so at 
the expense of law-abiding workers forced to compete with convicts.

CALIFORNIA LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the California Lottery was quite informative, but omitted to 
state who gets the money. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean the pittance to the schools, or the costs of advertising, 
salaries, etc. I mean the money -- the millions that are reserved for prize 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
The way I look at it, a winner of $1 million gets $50,000 per year for 20 
years, so after the first payment, there is $950,000 in the pot. At the end of 
the initial year (at a mere 6% interest) this has grown to $1,007,000. After 
making 20 payments of $50,000 each, there still remains $1,236,320 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
My question is -- who gets the money?

How's this for a solution to our budget crisis? Design budgets with two-year 
life spans; have the people vote on them at congressional elections in 
November, and give them three alternative budgets to choose from: one proposed 
by Congress, one proposed by the White House and one proposed by non-elected 
officials from the Treasury and OMB. What a great way to force a deadline on 
our representatives and make them accountable!

CHARGERS SMELLED SUCCESS; JETS PLAYED A STINKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything about the Jets' performance smacked of last season -- a 
mistake-a-minute offense, a defense that could not stop any moving objects and 
special teams that backfired at crucial moments. It resulted in their biggest 
eyesore of 1990, a 39-3 loss to the Chargers at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And to think the Jets were actually expected to win, which goes to prove one 
thing: The Jets, despite some encouraging signs in the previous five weeks, are 
capable of a stinker on any given day, regardless of the opponent. They proved 
they can lose with the worst of them. In Dick Vitale vernacular, the Jets are a 
bunch of Dow Jonesers. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bruce Coslet is the first to admit it. "We're susceptible to this every 
time we go out against I-don't-care-who-it-is," Coslet said. "We can get 
toasted or we can beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
That it happened against the Chargers, a team on the brink of turmoil after 
last week's embarrassing, 36-14 loss to the Steelers -- made it even more 
jarring. "I feel like committing a crime," cornerback James Hasty said. 
</P>
<P>
But the players refused to admit that this one hurt more because they lost to a 
so-called inferior team. "A loss is a loss is a loss," tackle Brett Miller 
said. "You want to win the ones you think you should win, but it comes down to 
the fact that, whether it's against the Super Bowl champs or the Toilet Bowl 
champs, you can't let these losses pile up. This is the time of the year you 
have to break out of your shell and start putting some wins up there." 
</P>
<P>
In his postgame address to the team, Coslet remained calm, according to 
players. Instead of yelling, he issued a challenge, telling them that next 
Sunday's game against the first-place Bills (4-1) will be a test of their 
mettle. "Look what happened to (the Chargers) last week; they got toasted in 
Pittsburgh," said Coslet, telling reporters what he told the team. "They came 
back, and they came in here and ripped us. We'll see if we can be that type of 
team." 
</P>
<P>
If the Jets (2-4) play like they did yesterday, they can forget about it. The 
Jets, a good-first-half, bad-second-half team in their previous games, played 
like it was two second halves. The Chargers whipped the Jets in every facet, a 
"total team effort," Coslet said. "Even the coaching staff got whipped." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Jets were crushed by the Chargers' mammoth offensive line. The 
Chargers gained 224 yards rushing, including a 40-yard touchdown run by Rod 
Bernstine that made the Jets look silly. Bernstine split the defense, bouncing 
off tacklers. The Jets' defenders pursued Bernstine as though they had their 
hands tied behind their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad part is that, going in, we knew their offense was three yards and a 
cloud of dust," linebacker Kyle Clifton said. "That's exactly what they did, 
and we still couldn't stop them." 
</P>
<P>
Now the Jets must regroup for the Bills, who earlier beat them, 30-7. It won't 
be easy. Things could get hairier with another blowout. "October is the key 
month," defensive tackle Marvin Washington said. "It separates the contenders 
from the pretenders. We have to get something going. We don't want to be left 
in the dust."

VICTORY SPECIAL TO PASQUALE BUT ALSO HURTS

<P>
He was like a heavyweight boxer who had been forced to defend his title by 
knocking his former sparring partner senseless. 
</P>
<P>
It was business, bloody business, and while all around him they crowded with 
congratulations after the Chargers' 39-3 victory over the Jets, misty-eyed 
Larry Pasquale was in no mood to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts to see the guys go down like that," he said. "I love those Jets 
players as if they were my sons. They were loyal to me." 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale, the Chargers' special teams coordinator, was with the Jets from 1980 
to 1989 before being released along with Coach Joe Walton. 
</P>
<P>
Enlisted immediately by General Manager Bobby Beathard, Pasquale has helped the 
Charger special teams earn respect after a disastrous year under Joe Madden. 
</P>
<P>
While with the Jets, Pasquale was a favorite of both the players and the media, 
and as he walked off the field Sunday, he was surrounded by admirers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for our team that we won," Pasquale said, his voice cracking, "but I 
feel for those other guys. I feel for (Kyle) Clifton, and (Jeff) Lageman, and 
(Joe) Prokop, and (John) Booty, and (Erik) McMillan. I love them. They got 
great character. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm also happy for the Chargers, because they deserved to win today. They 
played hard, and they tried to do all the things right. Hopefully we can have 
the Chargers' special teams do what the Jets' special teams have done in the 
past. That's what we're working toward." 
</P>
<P>
While with the Jets, Pasquale's special teams had the best punt coverage 
statistics in the NFL from 1986-1988. But Sunday, it was the Charger coverage 
team that hogged the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the Jet punter, Prokop, could not cleanly field a low 
snap from center, and the Chargers fell on the ball at the New York 19. They 
were eventually stopped at the goal line, but the Jets would not be so 
fortunate on Prokop's next attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Prokop accepted the snap from center in his own end zone 
and looked like a kindergarten teacher surrounded during recess. Had he 
attempted to kick the ball, he might now be in a full body cast. 
</P>
<P>
Prokop took off running and was tackled at the five. On the following play, 
running back Marion Butts ran the ball in for a Charger touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad," said Foge Fazio, the man hired by the Jets to replace Pasquale. 
"It was embarrassing. It's never happened to me before." 
</P>
<P>
How good/bad day was it for the Chargers/Jets? For only the third time in 
Charger history, the team did not have to punt. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the speed of guys, you know the physical abilities of the guys," 
Pasquale said, "so there's no question I could stand in our meetings and speak 
from certainty as to what the Jets might or might not be able to do. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tremendous help to our guys. But my God, I can't take anything away 
from the Charger players. They stuck to the plan better than we have done all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
As if the Jets needed any further reminder of Pasquale's handiwork, running 
back Darrin Nelson returned a Prokop punt 33 yards to the New York three. The

"Our players were totally focused on doing the job today, and I think we're 
coming together as a team," Pasquale said. "I think our special teams guys are 
getting a feel for one another, just like the Jet players had a feeling for one 
another."

Name Game: Columnist Liz Smith reports that Vanity Fair magazine writer Maureen 
Orth asked Marla Maples whether she would keep her maiden name if she married 
real estate magnate Donald Trump. "I always promised Daddy I'd keep my name 
because I'm an only child and he never had a son . . . . so I don't know -- 
maybe Marla Maples Trump." Meanwhile, she is living well, Orth reports, with 
luxury suites in Aspen, Colo., and at Trump Plaza, a New York sublet and an 
apartment in Century City.

Queen's Ransom: A Canadian publisher has been ordered by a British court to 
surrender profits from "Courting Disaster," a best-seller by Malcolm Barker, a 
former royal family employee, and Tim Sobey, about Buckingham Palace scandals. 
"The penalty is extraordinary," said a Fleetwood Publications spokesman. Barker 
said he hoped the book, which is rife with descriptions of homosexuality, 
alcoholism and bad hygiene, would expose the Royal Family's lack of security 
and inspire improvements.

Next Best Thing: Playboy magazine is banned in Saudi Arabia, but Kimberley 
Conrad Hefner is starting a letter-writing campaign to American troops. "I'm 
asking all the recent playmates to write to our servicemen. I know many of us 
would go to Saudi Arabia tomorrow if we could," said the 1989 Playmate of the 
Year, who married Playboy founder Hugh Hefner last year. Her first letter 
included a picture of herself in a swimsuit.

Hello? Helmsley Hotel?: Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti does not like 
smoky rooms, or steps to climb off-stage. He likes his decor in jewel tones, 
king-size beds, large television screens and Italian movie tapes. These are 
among the particulars the famously particular tenor asked for with his recent 
reservation at the Blakely Hotel in Knoxville, Tenn. That's not all. When his 
plane lands, Pavarotti wants an electric golf cart to take him from his plane 
to his limo.

JACK SMITH: SEX, VIOLENCE AND TV DINNERS: WHAT IS MORE CIVILIZED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To my surprise, I have received nothing but support against the La Jolla woman 
who called my wife and me uncivilized for eating microwave dinners on trays 
while watching sex and violence on television. 
</P>
<P>
My wife has suggested that I write no more about our dining habits, but I know 
her concern is not personal. She is simply afraid that I am overdoing it. She 
is probably right, as usual; but having been accused of barbarism, I think it 
is only fair that I be permitted to offer some contrary opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Some point out, as I did, that civilized people are not necessarily good 
people: "Civilized people killed off the majority of the Native Americans in an 
attempt to 'civilize' them," writes Diane Silver of Arleta. "Civilized people 
demanded that Hawaiians, Africans and the above-mentioned Americans worship, 
dress and talk as they (the 'civilized' people) did. Civilized people spread 
smallpox, venereal diseases and other benefits of civilization." 
</P>
<P>
"Being civilized," writes Deanna Williams of Monterey Park, "means having the 
ability, freedom and opportunity to do what one wants to do, whether it is 
eating gourmet meals at the dining-room table while reciting Shakespeare or 
eating microwave dinners in front of the TV. Personally, I consider the efforts 
involved in cooking to be decidedly barbaric and microwaving to be the only 
civilized solution." 
</P>
<P>
"A pox on these small-minded, smug, opinionated 'civilized' people," writes Joy 
Logie of Riverside. "I believe, like beauty, civilized is in the eye of the 
beholder. To me, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, you are regally civilized." 
</P>
<P>
Some argued that the pleasures of dining en famille are exaggerated. Maxine 
Schneiderman of Studio City recalls that when her three children were at home, 
the dinner hour was a time for airing grievances, reporting on the day's 
activities, discussing current events and engaging in stimulating conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, it was also a time for whining, tattling, kicking one 
another under the table, food fights and encouraging a sibling to laugh with a 
mouth filled with food or drink. Occasionally we were regaled with punching, 
teasing and major-league belching contests. Invariably, someone left the table 
in tears. So much for civility. 
</P>
<P>
"We somehow managed to hang on to our sanity and marital status throughout 
those fun-filled years of tabled togetherness. Now the frolickers are free to 
perform at their own tables, leaving us to dining a deux, thoroughly content to 
let the TV do the talking while we do the eating. Whatever highlights of our 
day we feel hard-pressed to share fit easily into commercial time. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a civilized couple. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Johnson of Redondo Beach writes that there is no romance in cooking for 
two: "I really identify with losing interest in fussing over the evening meal. 
No matter how many cookbooks and wonderful recipes one has, cooking for two is 
a waste of time. With just two faces left around our dinner table, my fervor 
over the evening meal has gone." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, I did raise some heat with my idea of asking my wife to cook 
a dinner from one of her recipe books and serve it on the dining room table so 
we could talk the whole thing over. 
</P>
<P>
"What would be wrong with you and your wife preparing a home-cooked meal to be 
served on the dining room table while talking the whole thing over?" asks Ellie 
Schiff Bernard. "There is a barbaric, uncivilized person at the Jack Smith 
house but it isn't Mrs. Smith." 
</P>
<P>
"No, Mr. Smith," writes Margarete Connolly of San Francisco. "One of these days 
you have a home-cooked dinner waiting for your wife when she comes home and 
then you talk it over." 
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to come off here with too much of a blazing feminist attack," 
graciously writes Jan Brown of Panorama City, "because you are in most ways a 
joy. However, surely in your wife's collection of perhaps 1,000 cookbooks, 
there are one or two meals that you might be able to rustle up for the TV 
trays. 
</P>
<P>
"While I might not find the state of your dining room table or your choice of 
where to eat barbaric or uncivilized, I certainly find your matter-of-fact 
placement of all meal preparation responsibility on your wife to be, at the 
least, archaic. One of these days, why don't you cook a home-cooked meal and 
have it waiting for your wife when she gets home from work?" 
</P>
<P>
The last time I tried preparing dinner from a recipe was years ago, when our 
boys were small. One Saturday afternoon when my wife was gone we decided to 
surprise her by cooking veal parmigiana. When she walked in we had sauce on the 
kitchen ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
But I have decided to meet the challenge. I have already picked my recipe. It 
is Lamb Chops with Gjetost Sauce. I found it in one of my wife's cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
Stand by for a full report. (If I can't get gjetost, of course, I'll have to 
skip it.)

INTO THE NIGHT: L.A. SAYS 'WELCOME' TO NEVILLE BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: A welcome-to-L.A. party for the Neville Brothers, the musical group 
that is to New Orleans what the Grateful Dead is to San Francisco. A&amp;M 
Records hosted the event Thursday night at Cha Cha Cha in East Hollywood, in 
the midst of the brothers' seven-night stand (with Linda Ronstadt) at the 
Universal Amphitheater. Although they've been performing for more than two 
decades, the Nevilles are more popular than ever before with Aaron Neville's 
duet of "Don't Know Much" with Ronstadt and the group's new album, "Brother's 
Keeper." 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: "This is really nice," surprised guests kept repeating, and indeed it 
was more like a party in a private home than your typical record company 
shindig. What made it special was what was missing -- Hollywood attitude, 
schmoozers in shiny suits and the ubiquitous AMWs (actors-models-whatevers). 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The brothers Neville -- Aaron, Art, Charles and Cyril -- along 
with Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss (the A and the M in A&amp;M). Also attending 
were "Married . . . With Children" star Katey Sagal, rock impresario Bill 
Graham and musician Herbie Hancock. Media types there included KCBS reporter 
Hosea Sanders (not working), who said, "I've known these guys for years," and a 
crew from ABC's "PrimeTime Live," which is preparing a segment on the group. 
(Wonder if Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer have known these guys for years?) 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: After-work-come-as-you-are. Herb Alpert wore an unconstructed 
jacket and a baseball cap turned backward, while Cyril Neville wore a pendant 
with a portrait of Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Caribbean cuisine -- chicken marinated in fruit, black beans, rice, 
crispy pizzas, banana chips and sangria. 
</P>
<P>
Crashability: There wasn't much to prevent anyone from strolling right in, but 
word must not have gotten out about this one: There wasn't a single paparazzo 
stationed on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "I'm being attacked by a branch," said Jerry Moss, swatting away a 
malevolent tree on the patio. Asked how A&amp;M managed to build the longtime 
band into a super group, Moss said: "Because we're better than the other record 
companies in town. And people are tired of formula music." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: With so many good restaurants in L.A., planners often show no 
imagination when it comes to devising party locales. Cha Cha Cha was an 
excellent choice, and the restaurant's small size ensured that the party never 
turned into a melee of business cards and cheek kissing. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: To paraphrase Ann Richards at the 1988 Democratic Convention, where 
was Linda? (Ronstadt had RSVP'd, but proved to be a no-show.)

PLIMPTON CAPTURES BEST TIMES; 
</P>
<P>
THE BEST OF PLIMPTON BY GEORGE PLIMPTON; ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS $19.95, 288 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ihave to admit a depressing thing. Up until now, I have stayed away from 
reading George Plimpton. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose, in one of his own phrases, I have "seethed with envy." Plimpton is a 
Harvard man. He comes from a fine New England family. His money is family 
money. He invented (up to a point) "The Paris Review." 
</P>
<P>
And he has made his career in the most irritating possible way (at least from 
the point of view of the middle-class drudge): Plimpton has gone out to have 
fun. And he has succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
It is intolerable, when you think about it, that while the rest of us pay bills 
and fret about taxes and car pools and picking up the dry cleaning, George 
Plimpton has been playing baseball in Yankee Stadium "in a post-season affair . 
. . between teams from the National and American Leagues headed respectively by 
Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle." 
</P>
<P>
Or whanging the triangle in a symphony orchestra conducted by Leonard 
Bernstein. Or hanging out in a dressing room with Muhammad Ali before a fight. 
Or -- the final irritation! -- sitting across the table from that noble boxing 
champ and the renowned poet, Marianne Moore, watching that unlikely pair 
collaborate on a poem. 
</P>
<P>
All this fun, while the rest of us have been stuck picking up the dry cleaning! 
</P>
<P>
But when, sulkily and suspiciously, the reader cracks open "The Best of George 
Plimpton," something else -- akin to envy but far more complex -- kicks in. 
Here is Plimpton, bravely explaining his notion of "participatory journalism," 
reminding us that we all want to know what "it" was like -- whatever it was. 
</P>
<P>
A corollary of that fact is that though we all admire success, we begin to 
notice early on that we may not end up playing in the big leagues; indeed, in 
the larger sense we may be doomed to lead bush league lives. 
</P>
<P>
Life being what it is, a Mickey Mantle can never write the Great American 
Novel; a William Styron will never be a movie star. In the face of all that, 
Plimpton has decided to juggle the odds, tilt the penball machine, and do as 
much as he can. And the way that he writes about it is pure crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. His is a life of privilege, and he can give us a portrait of John Kennedy 
at Newport, playing on the sand with his kids that is -- really! -- unblemished 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Plimpton hangs out with celebrities, so he can retail for us the silly 
picture of Norman Mailer at a Fourth of July party, bending over fireworks, 
misjudging the blast, and rolling head over heels without ever spilling his 
huge bourbon drink. 
</P>
<P>
And here is Warren Beatty, sliding through life by telephone, asking Plimpton 
the perennial question: "Is this the man who has never had an olive?", and 
waiting for Plimpton's ritual, wistful answer, "Is that you, Warren?" 
</P>
<P>
The truth in these essays is this, and it is what we feel sometimes, thumbing 
through old photograph albums. Even though you have the experience, you can 
never really keep it. 
</P>
<P>
Fun is the mercury of life; it splits, slides, rolls away and is gone. There 
will never again be the moment in Paris when William Styron finishes reading 
aloud "The Long March" for his friends; never again the moment when Muhammad 
Ali "helps" Marianne Moore with her poem. And no John-John Kennedy "thumping 
sturdily through the sand toward his father." 
</P>
<P>
These moments are as lost to Plimpton as they are to us, and that's when the 
reader's seething envy turns to awe. This is a terrific book. Buy some now, and 
for Christmas, give a copy to every guy you know. 
</P>

Musicians Take a History-Making Tour: In the first visit of its kind since 
Korea divided at the end of World War II, a contingent of South Korean 
musicians crossed into North Korea on Sunday on an unprecedented 11-day visit 
to the Communist North. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-person group entered North Korea through the truce village of Panmunjom, 
35 miles north of Seoul, and were met by about 600 people. Members of the 
group, mostly experts in traditional Korean music, will attend a "unification 
music festival" and return home next week. The visit was authorized by the 
Seoul government. North Korea guaranteed the group's free passage and safe 
return. CLAUDIA PUIG

KID BEAT: TAFFY: IT'S A WOODSTOCK FOR UNDER-10 SET; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: 2,300 SHOW UP TO WATCH PUDDLEDUMPLIN' PIGS, PERKY SINGERS AND COMIC 
MIMES ENTERTAIN AT THE FESTIVAL.

Two pigs, Lord and Lady Bacon, were renewing their wedding vows. 
</P>
<P>
"We are gathered here to link these sausages in holy hamhock," intoned the 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of smiling children -- human children, that is -- made up most of the 
wedding party. A girl caught the bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
It was the highlight of the social season in Puddledumplin'. Of course, 
Puddledumplin' doesn't have a long season, for it's part of the two-day TAFFY, 
the Theatre Arts Festival for Youth held every fall at the Peter Strauss Ranch 
in the Santa Monica Mountains. This year's TAFFY drew approximately 2,300 on 
Saturday and was expected to be at least as popular on Sunday. If many more had 
come, it would have been too crowded for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
High drama broke out Saturday when one of Lady Bacon's ex-flames showed up to 
challenge the nuptials. Lord Bacon and the upstart fought a duel for Lady 
Bacon's hoof. The weapon of choice: a big dinner roll. Lord Bacon ate his roll 
faster, thereby vanquishing his rival. 
</P>
<P>
The Bacons were some of the Taffy Town Players, costumed and made up as 
Victorian-era creatures. The Players strolled around the lawn, engaging 
passersby in conversation. This year, they also presented more formal 
performances, such as the wedding, than I remembered from previous TAFFYs. 
</P>
<P>
But the main draw at TAFFY isn't bovine. It's the array of top children's 
entertainers, of the human variety, who fill three stages from 11 a.m. to 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to choose which stage to visit at any given hour. The decision 
could easily hinge on such variables as which stage was closest to the Ben and 
Jerry's ice cream truck, thereby providing a place to sit while slurping a cup 
of Cherry Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
That particular moment resulted in time spent watching one of TAFFY's few 
out-of-towners, Bob Schwartz, a singer from Canada. Schwartz doesn't project 
the same kid-level qualities of such superstar Canadians as Raffi or Sharon, 
Lois and Bram, but his act was notable for his poise in his interactions with 
audience members and for his use of a backup chorus of local kids. 
</P>
<P>
Children swarmed over the stage to be closer to perky singer Joanie Bartels, 
and they howled at the antics of comics Schwartz and Chung. Or at least most of 
them did; when Chung made a remark about one little girl, she threw a stick at 
him. Such were the perils of performing at this Woodstock for the under-10 set. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the sideshow attractions at TAFFY -- including a slew of crafts booths 
or doodling on the interior walls of a giant inflatable pillow -- the one that 
most interested my 5-year-old escort was balancing on the row of rocks that 
lines the road up to the ranch house. Such were the pleasures of a day at 
TAFFY.

CELLIST MANTEL AT BACH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saturday-night entry in the 1990 edition of the venerable Los Angeles Bach 
Festival took place in the small, Gothic-arched Shatto Chapel at First 
Congregational Church. There, cellist Gerhard Mantel paid homage to the mighty 
image of Johann Sebastian Bach while veering considerably away from the topic 
as the recital went on. 
</P>
<P>
Mantel, professor of cello at the Musikhochschule in Frankfurt, is not one of 
the glamour figures of the cello world; not for him the growling expansive 
swells of a Rostropovich, or the easy virtuosity of Yo-Yo Ma or rustic bounce 
of Lynn Harrell. Rather, Mantel produces a steady, even, solid yet sensitive 
tone from his instrument, riding the safe middle road between dry technical 
achievement and high drama. 
</P>
<P>
Mantel opened with an unfussy interpretation of J. S. Bach's viola da gamba 
Sonata No. 2, although he and his soft-focused pianist Karen Owen seemed to be 
operating on individual planes. Alone, Mantel pursued the rigors of Bach's 
Cello Suite No. 6 with a bit more freedom but little dynamic contrast and not 
much rhythmic indication that the suite is composed of dances. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Variations on "Ein Madchen oder Weibchen" from Mozart's "Die 
Zauberflote" received a warm, graceful if not particularly witty interpretation 
from Mantel as he weaved around Owen's stoic piano. 
</P>
<P>
Rachmaninoff's Sonata was hardly a piece one would expect to turn up at a Bach 
festival, but the undaunted Mantel responded with his most emotional 
performance of the night -- all things being relative -- while maintaining a 
leash on the composer's indulgences. 
</P>
<P>
As if to remind us why we were here, Mantel and Owen returned with the Adagio 
from Bach's viola da gamba Sonata No. 3 as an encore. RICHARD S. GINELL

L.A. MASTER CHORALE OPENS CURRIE'S FINAL SEASON AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis is one of those pieces that was born a monument, 
more often saluted than performed. Its choral terrors are legend and its 
interpretive complexities daunting. Sublimity was never easy. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Beethoven's Mass was the 
inaugural vehicle for John Currie's final season with the Los Angeles Master 
Chorale. Inevitably, it took the measure of the man and his chorus, to say 
nothing of the Sinfonia orchestra and a quartet of soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The frustratingly incomplete accomplishment could well be a paradigm for 
Currie's tenure here. Always an uncommonly score-bound conductor, Currie often 
let the work slip from limber glory into lumbering banality, usually at the 
least likely moment. 
</P>
<P>
The Gloria, for example, began well, though majestic rather than ecstatic. But 
the concluding fugues moved from the ponderous to the scrambled, in a welter of 
unrelated tempos and awkward transitions. 
</P>
<P>
Something similar happened in the Credo, following an unnecessary intermission. 
What had seemed slow but playfully controlled buoyancy launching "Et vitam 
venturi" quickly became merely slow, unredeemed by the ensuing frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. In the main, Currie's tempos were conservative, though when he 
opted for speed he pushed for the maximum possible. His dynamic scale was huge 
and apt, though the orchestra did not prove as flexible there as the chorus, 
skewing balances at the extremes. 
</P>
<P>
The 124-voice chorus provided potent and accommodating resources. The great 
ascending rockets that Beethoven sets off throughout the work could burst in a 
raucous shout from the tenors and basses, but otherwise this was choral singing 
of optimal impact, articulate in both text and music. 
</P>
<P>
The soloists occasionally lingered longer on a note than Currie wanted, though 
not justifying the in-your-face cues and pedestrian subdivisions he foisted on 
them, binding them rather than accompanying them. Soprano Carolann Page offered 
amplitude and nuance at the top, warmly and evenly seconded by mezzo Christine 
Cairns. Tenor Agostino Castagnola sounded wan and strained in the ascents, but 
baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore delivered a solid, expressive foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Concertmaster and personnel manager Stuart Canin soared sweetly and fluently in 
the Praeludium and Benedictus solo. The orchestra he assembled gave good weight 
despite intermittent patches of misintonation from the winds and struggles in 
the strings with Currie's abrupt gear changes. JOHN HENKEN

CARL ST. CLAIR, JOHN WILLIAMS OPEN BRIT FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stage full of musical performers, a program featuring a passel of star names, 
an audience dressed to the teeth and an elegant pops concert were the main 
ingredients: 
</P>
<P>
The British Arts Festival, a fortnight's worth of music, related to -- but 
ostensibly distinct from -- simultaneous retail and community celebrations of 
things British, began with a genuinely gala concert in Segerstrom Hall at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony, led by both its new music director, Carl St. Clair, and 
guest conductor John Williams, gave the first salvo in this two-week festival, 
a symphonic program consisting mostly of bonbons, but bonbons of high quality. 
</P>
<P>
It was a happy event -- preceded by a reception, followed by a dinner, both 
optional to the festive audience of 2,500 gathered in the Center -- given over 
largely to strong performances of short pieces. 
</P>
<P>
At its jolliest moment, host Lynn Redgrave joined English baritone John 
Shirley-Quirk, conductor St. Clair and the orchestra in reciting three 
too-brief excerpts from Walton's "Facade." 
</P>
<P>
These quickies, expertly guided by the attentive new music director, ought to 
serve as a down payment on a full performance of the work, perhaps on an 
occasion when money needs to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
Other high points of the evening also came in the post-intermission: when 
Williams led a rousing but unstrident reading of "Jupiter" from Holst's "The 
Planets"; when St. Clair conducted a touching and transparent performance of 
"Nimrod" from Elgar's "Enigma" Variations; when Williams closed the program 
proper with a real novelty, Peter Maxwell Davies' "An Orkney Wedding, With 
Sunrise," complete with bagpipe soloist. 
</P>
<P>
The rest was never less than pleasant, despite occasional fluffs from the 
brass, and usually authoritative. 
</P>
<P>
Two national anthems began the evening, two nationalistic encores ("Scotland 
the Brave" -- kilts there were at this event -- and "Land of Hope and Glory") 
ended it. 
</P>
<P>
Williams led a lush reading of his own music from "Jane Eyre." St. Clair 
conducted the Pacific Symphony and the huge Pacific Chorale in an excerpt from 
Walton's "Belshazzar's Feast" and another from Williams' score to the film 
"Empire of the Sun." Shirley-Quirk sang Papageno's aria from "Zauberflote" and 
one of Vaughan Williams' "Five Mystical Songs" with orchestra and chorale. 
</P>
<P>
And the new season seems in full swing.

'GUNPLAY': LAST DAY IN BOY'S LIFE ON HBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Gunplay: The Last Day in the Life of Brian Darling," an intense, half-hour 
drama premiering tonight at 8 on HBO, tells the true story of one of the 
hundreds of children who die each year in the United States due to accidental 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to stimulate a dialogue about gun safety between parents and 
children, and the story is simply told so that children will understand. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean it's easy to watch: Before it starts, Brian's father, 
John Darling, warns that children shouldn't see it alone. He's right. 
</P>
<P>
The film, written by Bruce Harmon and directed by Daniel Taplitz, is a series 
of ordinary events -- four young boys playing, teasing, coming home late from 
the park, being scolded, eating dinner, watching TV, playing video games. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are busy, distracted and impatient, but caring. Throughout, an unspoken 
point is made that it's parental supervision, not love, that comes up short. 
</P>
<P>
One boy, low man in his social hierarchy, is nervous about a recent 
neighborhood robbery and skittish about night noises. Even if the title didn't 
give it away, you'd know something dreadful was in store. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even though knowing what's going to happen prematurely infuses the 
ordinary with vague menace, the inevitable violent death comes as a shock. 
</P>
<P>
The program carefully avoids being an anti-gun polemic. Afterward, John Darling 
offers gun-safety tips for adults and children and tells parents, "Don't let 
your kid disappear from your life the way Brian did from ours."

ROBINSON SAYS RAMS 'IN BIG TROUBLE'; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THIS TIME IT'S CHICAGO'S HARBAUGH WHO HAS A PERSONAL-RECORD GAME 
AGAINST THE RAMS' DEFENSE IN BEARS' 38-9 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These befuddling 1990 Rams, by now you know them so well: First in offensive 
production, first in preseason expectations and, for the forseeable future, 
last in the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
Last and playing defense in a way that offers mediocre quarterbacks the 
opportunity to have the games of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Last, plumbing what their head coach called "rock bottom" with a 1-4 record and 
finding themselves jockeying for draft position, not home-field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
And, after Sunday night's 38-9 loss to the Chicago Bears and their 
superstar-for-a-day quarterback Jim Harbaugh, dead last and reduced to watching 
their season of Super-dreams slip away loss by loss by loss. 
</P>
<P>
It is enough to make a poor head coach sound as if he suddenly can't wait for 
the Rams' next week off, which, if all continues this way, should come around 
the first week of January and extend far beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obviously a terrible performance on our part," Coach John Robinson 
said. "We are just not playing the football that we can play or thought we 
could play. Our football team is obviously in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The facts: In the decisive first half, the Bears scored a touchdown every time 
they had the ball save for their last, when they took over with only 37 seconds 
remaining. They converted all seven of their first-half third-down attempts. 
They outgained the Rams 254 to 91, and they controlled the ball for nearly 19 
minutes. When that half was over, it was 28-0, and the Rams were four games 
behind the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have given up a personal record passing day to an opposing quarterback 
for the second consecutive week (Sunday, Harbaugh's 248 yards; last week, 
Boomer Esiason's 471 yards) and seem to have no answers for how to stop the 
record-book parade. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday night's exposing of all-to-familiar Ram weaknesses, Robinson 
admitted he has had deep worries about this team for some time, deep enough for 
him to finally, exasperatedly and publicly give voice to them. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to be in a position where you acknowledge that you're in deep 
trouble this year," Robinson said, explaining why he hasn't sounded so 
disconsolate in the Rams' previous defeats. "Privately, we were very concerned 
about some things, and publicly we just tried (to keep) some of those things at 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no sense in us minimizing the state that we're in. We just are 
unable to do much of anything, really." 
</P>
<P>
On top of this reckoning, the Rams had more bad news: The loss of inside 
linebacker Fred Strickland for the season after he broke the fibula in his left 
leg on a second-quarter play. 
</P>
<P>
A week after yielding 563 yards to a diverse Cincinnati Bengal offense, the 
Rams allowed 402 to a Bear offense that was previously a one-dimensional 
running team and happy to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams went into this game with the idea to hold the Chicago offense early, 
put the ball in the end zone when they had it and force the Bears out of their 
pound-it-out mindset. Then reality hit hard on this dank Chicago night. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears (5-1), looking a bit awkward but still moving the ball on a blitzing 
Ram defense, took the opening kick-off and drove 88 yards on 12 plays, the last 
a 12-yard Harbaugh to Neal Anderson touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
On the scoring play, the Rams' three-man rush gave Harbaugh time in the pocket 
to look left, look right, look all over, look mighty comfortable, then find 
Anderson breaking free across the back of the end zone to the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
There went the stop-the-Bear-offense part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Ram quarterback Jim Everett floated one too far for tight 
end Pete Holohan over the middle, and the ball was snared by Bear cornerback 
Donnell Woolford and returned to the Ram 36. 
</P>
<P>
And there went the score-early part of the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, the Bears led, 14-0, after Harbaugh darted up the middle and 
dove into the end zone for a 12-yard touchdown, and Robinson said he couldn't 
help but flash back to last week's 21-0 Bengal first-half Ram blitzkrieg. 
</P>
<P>
"Another slow start -- it's shocking," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After the next Ram drive fizzled when they failed on fourth and one from the 
Chicago 42, the Bears stormed right back up the field for a 58-yard touchdown 
drive and a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams offense sputtered. Once again, they drove into Chicago territory, but 
again turned the ball over on downs after going for a first down on fourth and 
short. 
</P>
<P>
The offense, which totaled only 267 yards, never seemed to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm personally embarrassed," Everett said of the team's overall performance. 
"I never dreamt that we would be in this type of position, but we are. Right 
now, we're stinking up the field." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the first half, Harbaugh, who had completed only 51 passes 
going into Sunday, whose personal record pass-yardage total was 205 and who had 
thrown just three touchdown passes all year, strafed the Ram defense for nine 
consecutive completions. Harbaugh passed his personal record early in the third 
quarter and could have gunned for a doubling of that total if he had remained 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, after another long, pass-driven Bear drive and a 13-yard touchdown 
romp by Brad Muster, Chicago led, 28-0, and the half and any hope of a Ram 
renaissance on this night was done. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's making any plays," said cornerback Jerry Gray, who just missed an 
interception that could have been returned for a touchdown but instead turned 
into a 32-yard Bear gain. "That play is just a sign of what's wrong: one step 
away from being 4-1 or 5-0." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams averted total embarrassment and the shutout in the third quarter when 
a 53-yard Everett-to-Flipper Anderson bomb set up an 11-yard touchdown pass to 
Buford McGee, slicing the lead to 31-6. But even that meaningless score had its 
sorrows for the Rams -- kicker Mike Lansford flubbed the extra-point attempt 
wide left. 
</P>
<P>
After the Bears made it 38-9 on a 15-yard Anderson touchdown run, the Rams 
officially tossed in the towel by removing Everett for backup Chuck Long, who 
saw his first action of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," said Everett, who finished with only 13 completions on 31 
attempts for a season-low 187 yards, one touchdown and one interception. "Not 
only talking (to the media), but looking in the mirror. It's not who we think 
we are. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's a real low point for us. I just hope this isn't how the whole 
season goes." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting inside linebacker Fred Strickland, who has been plagued by injuries 
throughout his career, fractured his left fibula in the second quarter and will 
miss the rest of the season. Strickland appeared to have been hit in the leg 
from behind by a falling Bear player. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Strickland, the Rams had no serious injuries. Both receiver Henry 
Ellard and cornerback Alfred Jackson suffered hip flexors but are not expected 
to miss any time.

A HEALTHY HRUDEY KEEPS KINGS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago at this time, goalie Kelly Hrudey of the Kings was worn out after 
one period, sweat pouring down his aching body. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, Hrudey played three full periods, saved 42 shots and led his team 
to a 4-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
No sweat. 
</P>
<P>
"Facing 43 shots is not a big deal," Hrudey said, "if you feel all right." 
</P>
<P>
But it was a very big deal for the Kings, who remained atop the Smythe 
Division, a point ahead of the Calgary Flames, by completing an impressive 
four-day weekend that also included a Thursday tie with the defending Stanley 
Cup champion Edmonton Oilers and a 7-1 victory Saturday over the defending 
Wales Conference champion Boston Bruins. A year ago, Hrudey was suffering from 
the early stages of what would turn out to be a four-month bout with 
mononucleosis, an illness that would all but ruin his season. 
</P>
<P>
His Kings were suffering from a different sort of malaise, one that would seem 
to sap their strength on the second night of back to back games, and cause 
their defense to look ill at the most inopportune times. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend, we showed we are committed," Hrudey said. "Last year, we might 
not have taken advantage of the situation and squandered a game like tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"The win (Saturday) wouldn't have meant anything without a win (Sunday)." 
Hrudey's big night followed a similar performance Saturday by backup goalie 
Daniel Berthiaume, who saved 40 shots against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pushing each other," Wayne Gretzky said. "That's good for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
No argument from Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a great read," he said of Gretzky's remarks. "That's exactly what 
happened. We are challenging each other. After watching (Berthiaume's) 
phenomenal game, I knew I needed a great performance just to get close." 
</P>
<P>
Never, advised Gretzky, underestimate the importance of the man in the mask. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care who you're talking about," he said. "The teams that won 
championships always had great goaltending. If you don't get great goaltending, 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Or a great defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, despite the absence of injured Tim Watters, Marty McSorley, Tom 
Laidlaw and Bob Halkidis, are playing an air-tight game with two goals against 
in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goaltenders are getting the first save," Gretzky said, "but now, they are 
not having to make the second, third and fourth saves." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, before 13,777 at the Forum, the Kings even shut out Brett Hull, the 
Blues' 72-goal scorer of last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday didn't start out well for the Kings. They let the first opportunity 
of the night slip away. 
</P>
<P>
When Paul MacLean was assessed consecutive penalties for hooking Tony Granato 
and for unsportsmanlike conduct, the best the Kings could up with was two shots 
on goal in the next four minutes, both of which missed. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kings' penalty box received its first visitor, however, the Blues were 
more responsive. 
</P>
<P>
With Rene Chapdelaine out for holding, St. Louis scored on a 35-foot slap shot 
by Geoff Courtnall, fired from the left side. The puck glanced off Hrudey's 
glove into the net at the 10:25 mark of the first period. It was Courtnall's 
fourth goal and team-leading fifth point. 
</P>
<P>
It was also only the third time the opposition had scored on the Kings' 
penalty-killing unit in 27 tries. Entering play Sunday, the Kings were the 
league's top penalty killers. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings came back to score a power play goal of their own at 13:44 of the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Elik, rushing the net from the right side, tried to dump the puck to Luc 
Robitaille in the slot. Instead, it glanced off defenseman Scott Stevens' 
skate, sliding into the right circle. From there, Dave Taylor put the puck 
through goalie Curtis Joseph's pads for his first goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings went ahead on a goal that never touched the ice. 
</P>
<P>
On another power play, Gretzky fed Rob Blake the puck in the right circle. 
Blake took a shot that Tomas Sandstrom, standing by the right post, deflected 
into the upper-right corner of the net while a helpless Joseph stood by. The 
goal, coming 16:16 into the second period, was Sandstrom's third. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' third goal was scored by Bob Kudelski at 8:40 of the final period 
after he took it away from MacLean along the left boards. 
</P>
<P>
Kudelski skated up the left side within reach of Joseph and then shoved the 
puck past him for the unassisted goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third goal in two nights for Kudelski, who had 23 last season in 62 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille scored the final goal of the night off a pass from Elik. It was 
Robitaille's fourth of the season and the 200th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew this feeling last year," Hrudey said when it was over. "I feel 
great, like I barely played a game." 
</P>
<P>
Amazing what good health will do for you. 
</P>
<P>
And good defense.

REALITY IS TELLING FOR THE LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: GAMES AGAINST PORTLAND SHOW THAT MUCH WORK IS NEEDED BY TEAM IN 
TRANSITION.

Between the Lakers' mid-summer funk, after their challengers made their 
personnel moves; and pre-camp euphoria, after they made their own, lies a 
middle ground called reality, which they discovered over the weekend with the 
help of the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
To the Lakers, reality means: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They have a lot of work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their big men -- mainly Vlade Divac -- have a whole lot of work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Trail Blazers look like the team to beat in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Ask someone who should know. 
</P>
<P>
"They won the West Conference a year ago," Coach Mike Dunleavy said. "Bottom 
line, they're the Western Conference champs till someone beats them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Magic Johnson: "I think they (Blazers) are already rated the team to beat, 
with Phoenix and us right there. They (Blazers) have a strong team. They know 
each other well." 
</P>
<P>
Is the rating deserved? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah," Johnson said. "They deserve their rating." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers have talent, size, depth, experience and are adding only one 
significant player -- Danny Ainge, who has already suggested pointedly he'll 
help. 
</P>
<P>
For all their talent and their new depth, the Lakers are in transition. They 
have a new coach, a new starting center (Divac) and two new players (Sam 
Perkins and Terry Teagle) in the nine-man rotation. If rookie 
sometime-sensation Elden Campbell plays, it will be three of 10. They are 
installing a new offense, some of which isn't in yet. They are changing the way 
they play defense. 
</P>
<P>
The way they played defense here needs to be changed, starting in the middle 
with Divac, who came in out of shape and is trying to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Divac lost a couple of weeks in late summer with a passport problem. At the 
world championships in Argentina, he misplaced his passport and instead of 
going straight back to Los Angeles, was rerouted home to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
In early camp, he played as if auditioning for a part in "Flatliners." 
Referring to Divac and Campbell, Dunleavy joked there were a "few lung 
transplants out there." 
</P>
<P>
Divac was only a little better in the first exhibition against the Trail 
Blazers Friday (23 minutes: three points, two rebounds) before beginning to 
show a pulse Saturday (22 minutes: 13 points, six rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight he was better," said Dunleavy after a loss Saturday night to the Trail 
Blazers gave the teams a 1-1 split. "He started being a little more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a lot more aggressive play out of our big players. Portland just 
manhandled us tonight on the boards. You've got to be aggressive to win in this 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"I need Vlade to be in better shape, to run the floor better. That's something 
he's done in the past, put pressure on teams. On the defensive side, he has to 
be more aggressive. He has to get to people quicker and not give up such good 
position." 
</P>
<P>
As a team, the Lakers have a collective problem, learning the new terminology 
and getting the new offense down, starting with the man in charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a little ways to go," Johnson said after Friday night's regular 
season-atmosphere victory. Then he corrected himself: "We've got a long ways to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, I'm out there thinking. I'm thinking about what I'm 
supposed to do after I pass it. I've got to know the plays. If I don't, they 
(his teammates) definitely don't. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, he (Dunleavy) called the play, and I didn't know what was 
going to happen. If I'm going to quarterback the team, I have to know the 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy figures the team is roughly on schedule . . . and needs to stay there. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I can't be too disappointed," he said Saturday night. "We played a 
really nice game last night. We played a typical exhibition game tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers flew home late Saturday night. They'll face Maccabi Tel Aviv Tuesday 
at the Forum and take on some real competition over the weekend, when the San 
Antonio Spurs, Cleveland Cavaliers and Milwaukee Bucks arrive for the Great 
Western Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have already taken the Trail Blazer test and, however demanding, 
found it worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"With that tournament, it doesn't get any easier," Johnson said. "Which is 
good. It'll help Elden. It'll help Vlade to play against big centers."

Trust Vice President Dan Quayle to come right out and speak his mind when asked 
to pick a World Series winner. 
</P>
<P>
Said Quayle: "I am vice president of all the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Intrepid reporters took another tack: Is Quayle, whose hometown of Huntington, 
Ind., is three hours from Cincinnati, a Reds fan? 
</P>
<P>
Quayle: "I'm from Indiana, and of course there's a lot of Cincinnati Reds fans 
in Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
The first pitch of the 1990 World Series is just a heartbeat away. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On this day in 1946, Enos Slaughter scored the deciding run from 
first base on a single as the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox, 
4-3, in the seventh game of the World Series. Who got the hit? 
</P>
<P>
Rowdy humor: In a promotional spot for ABC's comedy series "Coach," aired 
during last Monday night's Cleveland-Denver game, actor Jerry Van Dyke, who 
plays an assistant college football coach on the show, commented that even if 
the Browns were to beat the Broncos, they would still lose "because they have 
to go back to Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Mayor Michael White complained to Robert Iger, president of ABC 
Entertainment, calling the remark insensitive and disrespectful to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Iger promised to air an apology the night of Oct. 22, when ABC's Monday Night 
Football presents the Cincinnati at Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing scandal: Unlike what happened at the end of the Colorado-Missouri 
game Oct. 6, there was no fifth down in college football Saturday, but there 
will be another in November . . . and December. 
</P>
<P>
The Football Writers Assn. of America was formed in 1940, shortly after Cornell 
forfeited its "fifth down" victory to Dartmouth, and named its monthly 
publication (what else?) "The Fifth Down." 
</P>
<P>
Junk stats dept.: Jack O'Connell of the Hartford Courant, discussing the New 
York Yankees' dismal season, quoted first baseman Don Mattingly, who was 
sidelined during most of the season because of an injured back. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mattingly of the Yankees' last-place effort: "Basically, it was a waste." 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the point with a true throwaway statistic, O'Connell noted that 
Mattingly's replacement, Kevin Maas, set a major league record for fewest runs 
batted in by a player with 20 or more home runs. Maas had 21 homers and 43 RBIs 
in 254 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Flower power: Los Angeles in 1984 had its Peter Ueberroth. Beijing in 1990 has 
its schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Reuter reported that kids were required to buy the wilting flowers used to 
decorate the city during the Asian Games, which closed Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Bunches of chrysanthemums, daisies and dahlias were sold on street corners for 
30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
That's no excuse: Alan Prosser might be stuck with the distinction of being the 
worst soccer goalie in the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
In London Thursday, Prosser, 19, gave up 31 goals as his Siliconx Sports and 
Social team lost, 33-1, in Division Seven of Swansea's Sunday League, bringing 
his eight-game total of goals against to 131. 
</P>
<P>
Said Prosser of Thursday's performance: "It was not all my fault. Our defenders 
were invisible." 
</P>
<P>
Artistic victory: Cathy Gerring finished with a 278 to defeat Beth Daniel by 
one stroke Sunday in the LPGA World Championship at Cely, France.

The golfers kept their concentration, but that's not to say there weren't 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars worth of sculpture, including works by Joan Miro and 
Pierre-Auguste Renoir, decorate the course at the Cely Golf Club.

Quotebook: Harry Shearer, closing Sunday's edition of "Le Show" on KCRW-FM:

OLDIE GIANTS ARE GOODIES IN WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: EXPERIENCE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN NEW YORK'S 24-20 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When undefeated New York lined up against the once-beaten Washington Redskins 
Sunday to resume one of the league's great rivalries, many considered the 
Giants the NFL's best team east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins, by contrast, seemed to be in tough shape. An injury had cost them 
quarterback Mark Rypien, and their new passer was a second-year pro who, they 
feared, would blow hot and cold. 
</P>
<P>
He blew both. The more mature New York quarterback, Phil Simms, directed a 
cleverly designed pass offense that at times rivaled San Francisco's as the 
Giants outplayed Washington, 24-20, in a game that came down to the usual 
rousing Giant-Redskin finish. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's erratic young quarterback, Stan Humphries, gave the Redskins a 
chance to win during a fourth-quarter drive but threw his third and most 
crippling interception with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
That interception, by New York safety Greg Jackson, came on second down at the 
Giant 42. There was time enough to throw the ball away and try twice more in 
favorable field position -- but Humphries still has to learn that. 
</P>
<P>
Only two years ago he was playing for Division I-AA Northeast Louisiana. 
Sunday, he was making only his second NFL start. 
</P>
<P>
He was no match for Simms. On the day's three decisive plays, Simms, a 12-year 
NFL veteran who completed 22 of 25 passes in a Super Bowl game, threw three big 
passes for gains of 80, 61 and 63 yards to win his fifth consecutive game from 
the hard-luck Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"Our three big plays and their three (interceptions) were the difference," Bill 
Parcells, the coach of the Giants, said. "It was a typical Giant-Redskin game 
-- very exciting even for the coaches and players." 
</P>
<P>
Said Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs: "They gave (Humphries) a lot of different looks. 
I don't think you could ask any more of a young quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
The game was played in what felt like July weather before an overheated, 
screaming, capacity crowd of 54,737 in one of the league's loudest stadiums. 
And the Redskins may have lost it in the first 20 minutes when they dominated 
linebacker Lawrence Taylor and the others in the Giant defense, driving up and 
down the field but scoring only three points. 
</P>
<P>
That gave Simms his first shot: an 18-yard pass that wide receiver Stephen 
Baker carried another 62 yards to the touchdown that put the Giants in the lead 
for good, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, on two other 80-yard drives, Simms was to set up the two touchdowns 
on passes down the middle for 61 yards to tight end Mark Bavaro and for 63 
yards to fullback Maurice Carthon. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells had concluded over the winter that the Redskins would be vulnerable to 
such plays in their double-double defense -- one in which they separated their 
two safeties to join cornerbacks and get two men on each Giant wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
This left a broad avenue in the middle for Bavaro and Carthon. Each time, Simms 
hit them in stride. 
</P>
<P>
Simms' other Giant-killing pass, the one to Baker, was simpler to throw and, in 
the end, more productive. A 5-foot-8, 160-pound sprinter from Fresno State, the 
littlest Giant was running a crossing pattern from far left to far right when 
Simms hit him. The ball got there an instant after New York's other crossing 
receiver, Mark Ingram, had picked off the Redskin cornerback running with 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
It was an illegal but effective pick of the kind introduced to 1980s football 
by the 49ers -- whom the Giants resembled as Simms passed for 283 yards, 
averaging almost 13 yards per throw. He completed 13 of 22 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Humphries kept the Redskins close. He could not wrest the lead from Simms, but 
Humphries moved Washington repeatedly with what was often surprisingly good 
football for a virtual rookie. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 2 and 223 pounds, Humphries is an instinctive runner who gained 41 
yards on six scrambles. Moreover, he has the big arm expected of NFL 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always expected," Simms said. "But a strong arm is overrated. (Humphries) 
will be a better passer when he has been up here awhile and throws with more 
(touch)." 
</P>
<P>
Five times Humphries marched the Redskins into scoring position. But they 
dribbled away the first three chances when he couldn't throw with quick 
accuracy when the Giant defense, pressed against its goal line, had less ground 
to cover than it had at at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
On Humphries' fourth chance, Gibbs saved him with a trick play, calling for a 
halfback pass by Earnest Byner to wide receiver Ricky Sanders for a 31-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
On his fifth chance, Humphries finally completed a close-in pass, throwing 10 
yards on third and eight to Clark, setting the Redskins up at the Giant 
two-yard line for the touchdown that made it 21-20 with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
They were to get no closer. In the last six minutes, the Redskins beat 
themselves with three mistakes -- kicking off out of bounds to award Simms 
possession at his 35, inadvertently touching a New York punt to give the Giants 
the ball back at the Redskins' one-yard line and throwing a final interception.

BUCCANEERS CONTINUE TURNAROUND, 26-14;

NFC: VINNY TESTAVERDE PASSES FOR A SEASON-HIGH 292 YARDS AS TAMPA BAY DEFEATS 
THE PACKERS TO REMAIN UNBEATEN AGAINST CENTRAL DIVISION TEAMS.

<P>
Vinny Testaverde and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers continued their turnarounds 
Sunday in a 26-14 victory over the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde, demonstrating the maturity that has made him the NFL's top-rated 
passer, completed 17 of 29 passes for a season-high 292 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers (4-2), who were 5-11 last season, are off to their best start 
since 1981 and have a 4-0 record against NFL Central Division opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to have scored more, but we had some breakdowns here and 
there," said Testaverde, who is in his fourth season out of Miami. "We just 
have to work on those things and come back strong next week." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Testaverde had an NFL-high 35 interceptions and passed for only 
13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he was intercepted 22 times and passed for 20 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But Testaverde's 14-yard touchdown pass to Ron Hall against the Packers gave 
him eight touchdowns against only two interceptions this season. He has not 
been intercepted in his last 96 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Haddix, returning from a knee sprain, ran back one of Tampa Bay's five 
interceptions for a touchdown as the Buccaneers dealt Green Bay (2-4) its 
fourth loss in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins, who was criticized for unimaginative play-calling 
in last week's 14-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, opened with four consecutive 
passing plays against the Packers -- three of them completions that set up the 
first of four field goals by Steve Christie. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the offensive line, 'We're gonna come out throwing it, loosen them up a 
little bit, then we'll settle in and get back to our game plan,' " Perkins 
said. "We wanted to loosen it up, but quite frankly I wanted to get some points 
on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski completed 25 of 42 passes for 355 yards and 
one touchdown, but his five interceptions helped Tampa Bay build a 26-7 lead 
and thwarted Green Bay's effort to come back. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of the glory when we win, so I take my share of the blame when we 
lose," Majkowski said. "I made some poor decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Haddix intercepted a sideline pass intended for Sterling Sharpe and returned it 
29 yards for his second touchdown of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Haddix had another interception on a tipped ball near the Buccaneers' goal line 
that stopped a Packer threat in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Moss, Harry Hamilton and Mark Robinson also intercepted Majkowski 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a simple fact that we can't be as charitable as we've been. . . ," said 
Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante, whose team had six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't given up on this team, and I don't expect anyone else to." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay scored both of its touchdowns in the third quarter. Ironically, one 
of them came on Hamilton's interception. 
</P>
<P>
The Tampa Bay safety picked off a pass at the Buccaneers' one, fumbled into the 
end zone on the return and the Packers' Jeff Query recovered for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski passed eight yards to Herman Fontenot for the other touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpe had seven receptions for 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Buccaneer running back Gary Anderson rushed for 46 yards in 11 carries and had 
four receptions for 96 yards -- the sixth consecutive game he has gained more 
than 100 yards from scrimmage.

CHIEFS HAVE WORD FOR VICTORY, 43-24;

<TEXT>
<P>
The game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions was supposed to 
be a matchup between defending NFL rushing champion Christian Okoye and 
runner-up Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was a showcase for Chief running back Barry Word, who rushed for a 
team-record 200 yards in 18 carries Sunday to lead the Chiefs to a 43-24 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Word's 200 yards were seven more than the club record set in 1981 by the late 
Joe Delaney. Word's big day included a 45-yard run in the third quarter and 
touchdown runs of 53 yards and one yard in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a day like this. That's why I don't know how to feel," said 
Word, who spent 4 1/2 months in prison in 1986 on charges of conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Word, who played at Virginia, had spent two years with the New Orleans Saints 
but was working for a telephone company last May when the Chiefs picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed," he said. "I knew I was capable if I just got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs (4-2) had a 17-14 halftime lead before taking complete command of 
the Lions (2-4) in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs piled up 566 yards in total offense, second-highest in team history. 
The 43 points were the most by Kansas City in five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We got our tails whipped," Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said. "That happens once 
in a while in the NFL. 
</P>

WITH OFFENSE IN HIGH GEAR, STEELERS WIN;

AFC: BRISTER PASSES FOR FOUR OF PITTSBURGH'S FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN 34-17 VICTORY 
OVER BRONCOS.

<P>
The Pittsburgh Steelers' offense, after failing to score a touchdown during the 
first four weeks of the season, has now scored nine. 
</P>
<P>
The offense had five in a 34-17 rout of the Denver Broncos Sunday, one week 
after getting four in a victory over the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bubby Brister passed for four of Sunday's scores with three going 
to rookie tight end Eric Green. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun," Brister said. "Hell, that was more fun playing football than I've 
had in a long time. I had a blast. We were laughing at times." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the Steelers were laughing at their own success and not at the 
futility of Denver's injury-riddled defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, already without two starters -- cornerback Tyrone Braxton and end 
Alphonso Carreker, who are out for the year with knee injuries -- lost two more 
Sunday when cornerback Wymon Henderson suffered a rib cartilage separation and 
defensive end Jim Szymanski broke his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson might be able to play next week, but Szymanski will be out eight to 
10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Bronco offense was without the NFL's leading rusher, Bobby Humphrey, who 
did not suit up because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
While the Broncos (2-4) lost their third in a row, Pittsburgh (3-3) is on the 
upswing. 
</P>
<P>
"For two straight games we've been able to muster some offense," Steeler Coach 
Chuck Noll said after a 451-yard output. "Bubby's able to handle the language 
(the terminology of new offensive coordinator Joe Walton) much better now. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we played a team with a lot of injuries and one that is coming off a 
Monday night game, but that's football. We didn't change the game plan because 
of their injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Lipps had nine catches for 141 yards as he exploited the inexperience of 
Denver cornerbacks Elliott Smith and rookie Alton Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
"Louis is an outstanding receiver and they had a guy back there who hasn't 
played that much," Noll said. 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves said his team couldn't compensate for a "makeshift 
lineup. We're hurting right now. We could not move the ball and could not stop 
them. Our effort thus far has not been pretty. The fans don't like it, but we 
are doing the best we can. I still think we'll be a factor before this season 
is over." 
</P>
<P>
Brister's other touchdown pass was a six-yarder to Lipps, and Merril Hoge ran 
six yards for the fifth Steeler score. 
</P>
<P>
Brister completed 21 of 28 passes for 353 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Winder and Steve Sewell ran for touchdowns to give Denver a 17-7 lead 
early in the second quarter, but the Steelers then scored four consecutive 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh began its comeback late in the first half, marching 55 yards in five 
plays for Brister's three-yard touchdown pass to Green with 1:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
While the Broncos' offense misfired in the second half, Pittsburgh put together 
scoring drives of 65, 75 and 74 yards. Brister's 23-yard pass to Lipps set up 
Hoge's go-ahead scoring run with 10:06 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers squandered another scoring chance moments later after a 90-yard 
pass play from Brister to Dwight Stone. Warren Williams was hit and fumbled the 
ball into the end zone, and Denver's Tim Lucas recovered for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
Brister found Green again on a 10-yard toss early in the final quarter, but the 
extra point failed on a bad snap, leaving the Steelers ahead, 27-17. On the 
next series, Brister found Lipps for 33 yards and connected with Green on a 
three-yarder with 3:56 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Donald Evans returned a John Elway fumble 59 yards to the Denver 
11-yard line in the closing seconds, but the Steelers allowed time to expire.

PINIELLA IS HAUNTED BY YANKEE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella, joking Sunday before the Cincinnati Reds' workout, was 
recounting stories ranging from his high school days as a basketball player in 
Tampa, to walking Schottzie around the streets of Cincinnati, when the 
questioning started. 
</P>
<P>
The smile disappeared from his face. His eyes started to burn with rage. His 
voice rose a couple of octaves. 
</P>
<P>
The questions dealt with Rickey Henderson, the Oakland Athletics' leadoff 
hitter, who is expected to provide more than enough problems on the field and 
was causing difficulty before the first pitch of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who played 1 1/2 seasons for Piniella in New York, spent his off-day 
criticizing his former manager, particularly the way he was treated in 1987. 
Piniella was asked to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a good relationship with Rickey," Piniella said. "He played hard for 
me. He's a good player. But we had that one problem that was caused upstairs, 
and that's where problems usually were caused, upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I said it then, and I'll say it now, I'm very protective of my players. I 
don't play players when I feel like it could damage their careers. I don't 
pitch pitchers that way. 
</P>
<P>
"And in this case here, it happened, and I'm sorry it happened. That's all I 
want to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter then tried to ask another question concerning Henderson. Piniella 
yelled, "I said that's enough!" He then said, "No, let's just talk baseball . . 
. can we please just start talking baseball? Let's don't start something before 
we even get going. Please, I'm asking you." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson twice went on the disabled list because of an injured hamstring that 
later was found to be torn in 1987, but there was constant pressure to force 
Henderson back. It reached a point that George Steinbrenner, Yankee majority 
owner, issued a statement in which he quoted Piniella as saying that Henderson 
was "jaking it," recommending a trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst thing that happened to me in my career," Henderson was quoted 
as saying in published reports Sunday. "It was hard for me to forgive him at 
the time . . . It hurt me when Lou told some reporters to go ask Rickey when is 
he going to play. That showed me he's not protecting me." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Cincinnati catcher Joe Oliver has seen the antacid commercial featuring a 
worried catcher studying film of Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I turned around today," Oliver said, "someone was asking me about 
it. I'm going to go home now and watch some football games. I figure the first 
thing I'll see is that stupid commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, the Reds' left fielder, on being frequently booed by the fans in 
Cincinnati: "I don't think I've ever been accepted by the fans here. Certainly, 
I've never been at ease with them. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to go out (and) wear jeans and cowboy boots to be accepted 
and be one of them. I'm not going to change. I'm not Pete Rose or Johnny Bench 
or part of the Big Red Machine. I'm just me. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I've learned a long time ago, you're only as good as your last 
at-bat, and no one will ever convince me differently." 
</P>
<P>
Piniella sat behind his desk sorting telegrams Sunday when one caught his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
It was from Steinbrenner: 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck, Lou. 
</P>
<P>
"You've played it before." 
</P>
<P>
"Play it like Fenway, '78." 
</P>
<P>
It was in, 1978, of course, when the Yankees battled back from a 14-game 
deficit, forced a one-game playoff with Boston and won on Bucky Dent's home run 
into the netting atop the Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble and Jose Rijo, two of the most outspoken Reds, struck a deal Sunday 
by which they said that neither will talk with reporters during the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much has been made out of what I've been saying, and the same with Jose," 
Dibble said. "So neither of us will speak during the Series." 
</P>
<P>
There was a bottle of champagne awaiting each of the Red players, coaches and 
staff, compliments of owner Marge Schott, when they arrived Sunday at the 
stadium. Each of their names was listed on the label that read: Cincinnati 
Reds, 1990 Western Division Champions. 
</P>
<P>
There was one name missing from the list, however: Bob Quinn, the general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well," Quinn said, "I don't need that to get any satisfaction. The 
satisfaction is being where we are. And there's also a tinge of satisfaction 
leaving New York and doing this. 
</P>
<P>
"George (Steinbrenner) said that I couldn't pull the trigger on trades. Well, 
we pulled five since I got here, and we did just fine here, didn't we?" 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco's injured finger hurt so much during the American League playoffs 
that he would not have played had it been earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were the regular season, he would probably have been out of the lineup," 
Oakland batting coach Merv Rettenmund told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco took batting practice for the first time Sunday since coming out of 
Game 4 Wednesday after striking out in the fifth inning. He hit the first pitch 
over the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was seeing the ball real good," Canseco said. "I was a little bit late. But 
my hand felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jackson, who had the lowest earned-run average (2.38) among Red starters 
in the playoffs, probably will be moved into the No. 2 spot ahead of Tom 
Browning, Piniella said. "This will keep Jackson on normal five days rest," 
Piniella said.

CANUCKS OUTLAST OILERS FOR A 5-4 VICTORY IN OVERTIME

<P>
The Vancouver Canucks displayed some uncharacteristic tenacity Sunday against 
the defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
After being on the ice for Edmonton's go-ahead goal in the third period, the 
Vancouver line of Greg Adams, Igor Larionov and Petri Skriko quickly made 
amends for their lack of backchecking. 
</P>
<P>
Adams scored the tying goal at 17:44 of the third period to send the the game 
into overtime and Skriko provided the winning goal at 1:32 in the Canucks' 5-4 
victory at Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an encouraging win for us because we played one of the best teams in 
hockey," Canuck Coach Bob McCammon said. "It was especially nice because we 
kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Skriko lifted a rebound high into the net after Oiler goaltender Bill Ranford 
stopped a close-in shot by Larionov. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (1-1-2) were the last undefeated team in the league until the 
Canucks (3-2) came back for their second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not good enough for us just to be close anymore," McCammon said. "We 
might just be better than people give us credit for." 
</P>
<P>
Esa Tikkanen, with his third goal of the game, had given the Oilers a 4-3 lead 
at 15:55 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson scored the other Edmonton goal against rookie goaltender Troy 
Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks also had goals from Trevor Linden, Dave Capuano and Dan Quinn as 
they outshot Edmonton, 37-27. It was the fourth consecutive game in which 
Linden has scored. 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen also scored in the first period with a chip shot into an unguarded 
goal and in the second period on a 60-foot slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 3, Chicago 1 -- Joel Otto scored his first goal of the season at 8:49 
of the third period at Chicago to break a 1-1 tie and lift the Flames to the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Otto knocked in a rebound after goaltender Ed Belfour had stopped a low slap 
shot by defenseman Jamie Macoun from the left point. Paul Ranheim added an 
empty-net goal with one second left for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly played better today than we did last night," said Flame Coach 
Doug Risebrough, whose team lost, 5-3, to New Jersey on Saturday night then 
flew to Chicago for its afternoon game against the Blackhawks. "It's not bad 
considering we took a two-hour flight from the East Coast, got to bed at two in 
the morning and ate our lunch at nine." 
</P>
<P>
The Flames are 11-0-2 against the Blackhawks since Feb. 23, 1986.

The poor health that has been troubling Greg LeMond kept the cyclist out of the 
Paris-Tours race and he will be sidelined for the last two races of the season, 
next week's Tour of Lombardy and the World Cup finale Oct. 27 in Lunel. 
</P>
<P>
Since winning his third Tour de France in July after a long battle to get back 
in shape, LeMond finished fourth in the World Championship, in which he was 
defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped out of the Grand Prix of the Americas Sept. 30 and recently gave up 
in the first stage of the Tour of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond won the Tour de France after a virus and winter promotional activities 
kept him from reaching his peak form until June.

GRAF DEFEATS SABATINI, 6-3, 6-2, IN FIRST MATCHUP SINCE U.S. OPEN

<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf overpowered Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 6-2, Sunday to win 
the European Indoor tournament for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was their first since Sabatini beat Graf to win the U.S. Open five 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, apparently recovered from a virus infection flare-up, used her powerful 
forehand to keep the second-seeded Sabatini at bay and improved her career 
record against the Argentine to 19-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I planned to play aggressively from the start, and it succeeded surprisingly 
well," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, playing less than 24 hours after a grueling three-set semifinal 
against Czechoslovakia's Jana Novotna, got off to a slow start and never 
recovered. She offered little resistance after losing her serve twice in the 
second set to fall behind, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, fourth in the world rankings, had little chance to display her recent 
more aggressive style in the 74-minute match, and several net forays provided 
easy points for Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the world's top-ranked woman player, captured her 52nd victory in a Grand 
Prix tournament and a $70,000 first prize.

COOK RUNS OUT OF LUCK IN VEGAS

<TEXT>
<P>
For a second Sunday, John Cook thought his 95-yard sand wedge was going to give 
him a miracle victory in the Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
But the shot, which would have been a birdie on the first hole of a playoff had 
it stayed in the cup, hit the bottom and spun out, landing 15 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tway then two-putted for par and collected $234,000 from the $1.3-million 
purse for winning the 90-hole tournament that was played over three desert 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
Was Cook disappointed, upset or angry about the ball that disappeared in the 
cup for the winner, then came out? 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the least," Cook said. "Not in this game. These things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tway, the leader by three shots at the start of the final round at Las Vegas 
Country Club, struggled all day. 
</P>
<P>
His lead was gone by the eighth hole, and when Cook birdied from 10 feet at the 
11th, Tway was behind. 
</P>
<P>
It stayed that way until Cook made his first mistake of the day, three-putting 
for bogey on the 16th. Each birdied the final hole to force a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
They finished 90 holes at 334, 26 under par. Cook had a closing 67 and Tway a 
70. 
</P>
<P>
On the first playoff hole, the par-four 12th, Cook pulled his tee shot behind a 
tree and had to play out into the fairway. With 95 yards to the hole, he hit 
his sand-wedge shot into the hole -- and out. 
</P>
<P>
Tway reached the green in two and two-putted for the par that became the winner 
when Cook missed a 15-footer from the front fringe. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Pavin and Phil Blackmar missed the playoff by three strokes at 337. Pavin 
came from a tie for 15th with a bogey-free, nine-under-par 63. Blackmar had a 
67 that included a three-putt par on the par-five 18th. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Gerring shot a one-under-par 71 and beat Beth Daniel by one stroke in the 
LPGA World Championship at Cely, France. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring, who led through every round, shot 10-under 278 to win her third title 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, needing a victory to clinch player-of-the-year honors, finished with a 
68. Patty Sheehan, who tied for fourth, remained in the running for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan can catch Daniel by winning the last official LPGA Tour event, the 
Mazda-Japan Classic in Tokyo, Nov. 1-4. If Sheehan wins and Daniel finishes 
below the top five, they would end in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring led from the 18th hole on the first day. She started the final round 
with a three-stroke advantage and increased it to seven with four birdies 
through five holes. 
</P>
<P>
But she then saw her lead shrink over the back nine, where she bogeyed three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Gerring hit through the 14th green to drop a shot, then missed the 15th green 
to bogey again. 
</P>
<P>
Defending tournament champion Betsy King had a 72 Sunday to finish third at 
282. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Rarick and Dottie Mochrie both carded 70 and tied at 284 with Sheehan, 
who shot 68. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Crampton shot a three-under-par 69 to win the Gatlin Brothers Southwest 
Senior Classic at Abilene, Tex., by four shots over Lee Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton had three consecutive sub-70 rounds for a 12-under-par 204 on the 
par-72, 6,843-yard Fairway Oaks Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez and Terry Dill finished tied for third at 210, two shots 
behind Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a precise shot-making round like the other two rounds," said 
Crampton, who had rounds of 67 and 68 to enter the final day with a three-shot 
lead over Robert Ganoa. The final two days were played in winds that gusted 
more than 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton never led by less than three, as he started his round with a pair of 
birdies. Ganoa pulled to within three on the fifth hole with a 25-foot birdie, 
but Crampton topped it with a 20-foot par. Crampton pulled away from Ganoa on 
the seventh when Crampton birdied and Ganoa bogeyed. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino got to within three shots, but he bogeyed the 17th hole to deny him a 
chance at winning his seventh tournament this year.

GRIM DUTY: BEARING THE BAD NEWS

<P>
With thousands of Marines in the Persian Gulf and tensions on the rise, someone 
here has to think the unthinkable. That someone is Marine Maj. John L. Sayre. 
</P>
<P>
In the event war breaks out, it will be his unenviable responsibility to 
deliver news of casualties to the families of local Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Sayre -- director of the Family Service Center at El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station and the base's casualty assistance calls officer -- would, in a 
worst-case scenario, organize teams of Navy chaplains and Marine officers to 
make solemn visits to the wives, husbands and parents of Marines missing or 
killed in action. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually know why we're there," Sayre said in an interview last week. 
"They know when they see an officer in uniform and a chaplain by his side. . . 
. Sometimes it seems I need the chaplain as much as the survivors." 
</P>
<P>
Being the bearer of bad news, Sayre says, is the toughest job he has had in 19 
years as a Marine. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes along with the Marine Corps policy that we take care of our own -- 
not only our own, but we take care of the families of our own," Sayre said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the reality of the gulf crisis struck close to home when eight 
Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton were killed after two Huey helicopters 
apparently collided and crashed in the Arabian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Although he hopes for a peaceful solution in the gulf, Sayer is bracing for the 
worst because "it would be a little late to start planning after something 
happened. What we are basically doing is trying to be prepared in case there 
are mass casualties." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after troops from the 3rd Marine Corps Air Wing shipped out in August, 
Sayre called together officers and chaplains from El Toro, Tustin, Camp 
Pendleton and Yuma, Ariz., for a class on how to deliver death notifications 
and conduct follow-up visits with family members to discuss funeral 
arrangements and survivors' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
When Sayre put out a request for help from each Marine unit, he was surprised 
when 78 officers showed up -- he had only expected 55 -- for a one-day training 
course in September. He asked how many of them had volunteered for the duty. 
"No one raised their hand," he recalled. "It is not a job that people would 
normally volunteer to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sayre attributes the larger turnout to a concern on the part of Marine 
commanders that a sufficient number of casualty assistance calls officers -- 
CACOs for short -- are available to help families if war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
"Grief is one of the strongest emotions people can have," said Sayre, who for 
two years has been notifying family members of Marine deaths. "Usually when 
parents or a wife see a military officer in uniform with a chaplain walking up 
to their door -- and their husband, son or daughter are deployed -- they know 
why we are there." 
</P>
<P>
Chaplains are present to give emotional support to family members after the 
CACO delivers the news. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard internally for me to have to tell someone that the person they love 
is dead," said El Toro Chaplain Gerald Cook, who has been making casualty calls 
to Marine and Navy families for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, Chaplain Arden Walz, said their main job is to help the Marine 
officer with the emotional fallout produced from the news of death. "We have 
some background in dealing with crisis situations." He recalled a time in 
Norfolk, Va., when he was along on a notification call and the young wife of a 
Marine locked herself in the bedroom when she heard the words that he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
The way a Marine dies also may play into the way loved ones react. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody is killed in action upholding and defending the Constitution and 
doing their duty, it makes it a lot easier," Walz explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I think we are talking basically about meaning and purpose in life. We 
see what our purpose is in the military. If a spouse sees that the way in which 
he was killed -- that there is meaning and purpose to what he was doing and it 
coincided with his military duty -- it makes it much easier. But I think that 
is a basic philosophical point of life here -- where death occurs . . . it 
makes all the difference in the world as far as the dependents accepting what 
has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Sayre said those who make home visits can never predict how family members will 
react. He said often they are just very sad, but sometimes they are very angry. 
</P>
<P>
Marine classroom material advises officers to be brief, to be a good listeners 
and to accept silence: "An embrace or holding their hand may convey far more 
than your words are able," one passage counsels. 
</P>
<P>
Officers are provided a brief statement for the survivors telling them that 
their husband, son, daughter or family member is either missing in action or 
dead. It concludes by saying in behalf of the secretary of the Navy "I extend 
to you and your family my deepest sympathy in your great loss. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Marine literature urges casualty assistance officers to be compassionate and 
not to argue with a family member in denial. They are instructed to listen to 
the family members' questions or expressions of grief and assure them of their 
willingness to assist. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the basic rules is never leave them alone," Sayre said. 
</P>
<P>
Instructions warn the CACOs to try to deliver the bad news in private and to 
expect shock and withdrawal, denial and anger, hysterical grief and physical 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Officers are advised to tell family members as much as possible about the 
circumstances of their loved one's death. Sayre noted that he always telephones 
Marine Corps headquarters just before leaving on a casualty call so he can have 
the very latest information available. 
</P>
<P>
The job doesn't end with the notification visit. A few days later, the CACO 
must deliver a $3,000 death gratuity check to the family, then visits to make 
arrangements for the funeral and shipment of the body, and follow up with 
longer sessions to discuss survivors' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the training class and counseling advice, Sayre said each experience 
is difficult and frequently haunting. 
</P>
<P>
One occasion that sticks in Sayre's mind occurred early one morning, when he 
stepped up to the porch of the home of a young Marine who had been killed in a 
military helicopter accident. The boy's mother came to the door, took one look 
at him and the chaplain and screamed, " 'I knew it. I knew it. He's dead.' . . 
. She was very emotional. You do work very, very carefully with people's 
emotions."

RECORD BREAKER: The murder trial of Thomas Maniscalco, which went to the jury 
six weeks ago, is setting longevity records in Orange County criminal courts. . 
. . At 16 months, the trial is already the longest criminal proceeding in 
county history -- so long that the judge had to suspend deliberations for two 
weeks to honor jurors' prepaid vacations. If found guilty, the biker-lawyer 
faces a possible death sentence in connection with a 1980 triple murder in 
Westminster. The penalty phase of the trial could stretch into next year. Jerry

IRON WORKERS RECAST IMAGE AS UNION CELEBRATES ITS 50TH YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THOUGH LOCAL 627 HAS ALWAYS HAD A RAUCOUS REPUTATION, THE UNION'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD MANAGEMENT AT THE NASSCO SHIPYARD HAS TEMPERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Robert Godinez, business agent for the Iron Workers Union, Local 627, chuckled 
when asked to compare the recent launching of a Navy supply ship, which went 
off without a hitch, and the launching of another Navy ship 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both ships -- the auxiliary oiler explosives (or AOE) Supply and the destroyer 
tender Cape Cod -- were built and launched at the National Steel &amp; 
Shipbuilding Co. shipyard. But the vessels also symbolized different eras in 
the sometimes confrontational, but always rocky relations between the iron 
workers local -- the largest of seven unions at Nassco -- and the shipyard that 
spawned the group 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company had gathered several dignitaries at the Aug. 2, 1980, launching of 
the Cape Cod, including Navy Undersecretary Robert J. Murray, as Nassco 
officials proudly waited to present their latest ship. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's approach to the podium was the cue for 200 iron workers, who marched 
toward the stage in a carefully planned demonstration and took over the 
platform. Stunned dignitaries, including a prospective Nassco customer, watched 
as some of the workers used bullhorns to give their own speeches, denouncing 
working conditions at the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed Nassco officials reacted swiftly. The company fired 27 of the 
protesters, including Miguel Salas, then business agent for Local 627. The 
union responded by staging a three-day wildcat strike that led to more firings. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, an arbitrator upheld the firings of Salas and 12 of the 27 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Local 627, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary on Saturday, has always 
had a raucous reputation. The men and women who make up its membership come 
from various ethnic groups and are as tough as the shipyard they work at. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Local 627 has survived a near fatal rift within its ranks, an 
attempted takeover by communist radicals, a takeover by its International Union 
and negative publicity it suffered when two of its members were convicted in 
federal court of attempting to bomb the Nassco shipyard during a bitter labor 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the present, Godinez, who has been a union member and Nassco 
employee since 1975, explained that the union's attitude toward management has 
been tempered somewhat since the 1980 incident. Indeed, in April, 1989, the 
iron workers and other unions joined management in a buyout of the shipyard 
after the former owner threatened to shut it down, following a $30 million 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Concerted activities" like the one staged at the Cape Cod launching are not 
necessarily a thing of the past, said Godinez, but a tactic that is now used 
when all else fails. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're making an attempt to work together," he said. "We brought our 
families to the launching (of the Supply) and everyone had a good time. But we 
also have to stand firm and defend our rights. That still happens more 
frequently than you think. Management doesn't really do us any favors." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its adversarial relationship with Nassco, Local 627 owes its existence 
to the shipyard. The union was founded in 1940 at what was then called National 
Iron Works. Lloyd Sanders, one of 30 men who organized the local, recalled that 
during World War II the company built mostly barges and refrigerator boxes for 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, 77, said that it was not until after the war that Nassco began 
building its first boats for the tuna industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 70 or 80 boats we built were tuna boats. Hell, we didn't know if the 
first one we built was going to float until they put it in the water, and it 
didn't sink," said Sanders in a telephone interview from his St. Joseph, Mo., 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hallett, Nassco's chief financial officer, noted the "highs and lows" that 
the company has experienced over the years in its labor relations with Local 
627, but agreed that both sides are less confrontational these days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our relationship is excellent. Over the last several years, both sides 
have learned that it's extremely important to talk to each other," Hallett 
said. "We don't see everything the same, but we have learned to sit down at the 
table and understand the other's position." 
</P>
<P>
However, both sides agreed that it was not too many years ago when sitting at a 
table was merely a prelude to frustration. It was a time when Local 627 
represented more than one-third of Nassco's 8,000 employees and the union, led 
by a group of young and intelligent radicals, relished the power and influence 
it could muster. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a time when the union appeared to have more leaders than followers. 
</P>
<P>
"Local 627 has had a long and interesting history," said local labor attorney 
Richard Prochazka. "But the late 1970s and early 1980s were certainly some of 
their most interesting periods." 
</P>
<P>
Local 627 president Tom McCammon recalled the labor strife that prevailed at 
Nassco in those years, much of it brought about by union complaints of unsafe 
working conditions at the shipyard. Worker dissatisfaction with the company 
also led to a split within the union, which was eventually torn apart by 
internal squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many different slates (factions) formed at the time. We didn't 
know who our leaders were from one day to another," said McCammon. "Meanwhile, 
there was a tremendous number of people getting injured at the yard and people 
were getting killed regularly. The union was disintegrating. People would file 
grievances which wouldn't go anywhere. It was incredibly chaotic." 
</P>
<P>
Anarchy reigned within the local and some members resorted to violence. Other 
union employees were involved in a break-in at Nassco's labor relations office. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in January, 1981, the Iron Workers International Union charged that 
Local 627 was operating "under a cloud of violence and threats of violence" and 
took control of the local union for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Both McCammon and Godinez credit Salas and former business agent Reynaldo 
(Cherokee) Inchaurregui with making Local 627 an aggressive union that stood up 
to Nassco management for workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Inchaurregui and McCammon, who has worked at Nassco since 1976, were among the 
13 workers fired in 1980 for their roles in the demonstration at the Cape Cod 
launching. However, the arbitrator who reviewed the firings ordered the 
shipyard to rehire McCammon a year later. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a rough place to work. Conditions were pretty primitive at the 
shipyard," said McCammon. "(Inchaurregui) had a different outlook on how unions 
should do business. He believed in a high-profile confrontational style. He set 
the pattern for the Iron Workers after that. He came up with the idea for 
petition drives, demonstrations and going to the press with our horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
"He organized people's anger and focused it at the company," McCammon added. 
</P>
<P>
It was Inchaurregui who came up with the idea for concerted activities, said 
Godinez. His style of leadership encouraged the local's members to get 
involved, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky that (Inchaurregui) became active at the right time. He made 
people feel a part of the union and like they had a say," said Godinez. "We 
were fortunate that there were a lot of active members. The unfortunate thing 
was that not everybody saw things the same way and this split the union into 
different factions." 
</P>
<P>
The factionalism within the union's ranks also encouraged violent 
confrontations with Nassco officials, said Godinez. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have massive lunchtime rallies, attended by 3,000 or more workers, 
where people would direct their frustrations at the company. Everyone wanted to 
show the members that they could be tougher with the company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Godinez remembered one rally, where a Nassco official was seen taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone felt that his presence was an attempt by the company to intimidate 
us. One group, well, how can I say it. Truthfully, they started beating up the 
guy. Then everybody decided to share their lunch with him." 
</P>
<P>
After that incident, the company outlawed the noontime rallies, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But the worst was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1980, the FBI and San Diego Police uncovered a plot by two iron 
workers and a member of the Communist Workers Party to blow up electrical 
transformers at the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
David Boyd and Rodney Johnston, both union members, and Michael Woo, a member 
of the Communist Workers Party, were arrested before they could go through with 
the plot and were tried in federal court. Johnston also admitted to being a 
party member. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing case became a cause celebre among U.S. leftists. The trio was 
sentenced to six months in federal prison each, but each defendant ended up 
serving only four months in custody. 
</P>
<P>
"They were caught up in the fervor of the times. They weren't really terrible 
people," said attorney Gene Iredale, who defended Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Hallett has a different opinion of the three men. 
</P>
<P>
"Here were three guys who were threatening Nassco officers and their families. 
Their agendas were way beyond that of the iron workers," said Hallett. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hallett said he had grudging admiration for the would-be bombers 
and the union's leaders at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very brilliant individuals. These guys were smart, but they had 
agendas that went beyond local issues," said Hallett. 
</P>
<P>
According to Iredale, Woo went on to complete his studies at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, while Salas earned a teaching degree and went on to 
become a college professor in Arizona. Salas and Woo could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
McCammon said the union's international leadership feared Salas' charisma and 
radical politics. 
</P>
<P>
"He came from an academic background. He had a college degree, which is rare 
for a shipyard worker. (Salas) was extremely intelligent and highly educated. 
He chose to go work in the shipyard. Most workers end up at a shipyard out of 
necessity, not choice," said McCammon. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over his 14-year affiliation with Local 627, McCammon said the 
union has been able to survive because "it's like a fire that refuses to go 
out." 
</P>
<P>
"This local has a long tradition, and different political factions are part of 
that tradition. You can blow it up into 1,000 pieces at election time, but when 
it comes time to negotiate a contract, everyone is together."

DEVELOPMENT: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH CO. GOES BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT TO 
PITCH ITS PLAN TO DEVELOP 768 ACRES. SOME OFFICIALS SEE POSSIBLE BENEFITS FOR

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 5 miles from the ocean, northwest of downtown, a vast tract of land sits 
undeveloped save a few bobbing oil pumps. 
</P>
<P>
This area is called Holly-Seacliff, and it is historic land -- the site of 
Huntington Beach's first oil gusher in 1920. It also is environmentally 
sensitive because it adjoins the Bolsa Chica State Ecological Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a proposal to turn this 768-acre site into the biggest single 
development project in the city's 86-year history. The Huntington Beach Co., 
the city's largest and most influential landowner, tonight hopes to win City 
Council approval for a 15-year plan to develop the Holly-Seacliff tract. 
</P>
<P>
The council, for its part, has said it hopes to extract a good deal for the 
city from the land developer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we can get some final details worked out, this development 
agreement will be a major benefit to the city in the long run," Mayor Thomas J. 
Mays said. "The city would get more fire and police services for that area, 
better water service and sewer service, several major road improvements. The 
city also would be getting land for the new Linear Park, one of the few 
regional parks in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents, however, worry about locking the city into a 15-year contract 
with the Huntington Beach Co. The company and the city have had a symbiotic 
relationship since 1904, when the company took over the village of Pacific 
City, changed its name to Huntington Beach and began marketing residential 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has been closely tied to the city's politics ever since. Planning 
Commission Chairwoman Geri Ortega claims that the city remains dominated by the 
powerful land company, even though Huntington Beach now has a population of 
180,000, a diverse economy, and other influential corporations -- notably 
McDonnell Douglas -- that are bigger and richer than the Huntington Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
Land company officials say that criticism such as Ortega's distorts the truth. 
They say the Huntington Beach Co. has been, and remains, a good corporate 
citizen, seeking only fairness from city government. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilman Peter M. Green, who was elected without the company's 
blessing, notes that as recently as January the Huntington Beach Co. demanded, 
and received, an immediate reversal of a City Council vote. That "flip-flop" 
vote on Jan. 8 came as the council was considering the general plan for 
Holly-Seacliff. 
</P>
<P>
"Holly-Seacliff is very important to the Huntington Beach Co.," says Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Co. owns about 80% of the land in Holly-Seacliff. The oil 
wells there are being phased out, and the company has plans to build 3,780 
homes on the land. The proposed development agreement the council is to take up 
tonight would give the company the go-ahead for those plans. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Michael Uberuaga, who took over as the city's top manager 
last February, has been blunt in dealing with the Huntington Beach Co. 
proposal. He has told the City Council repeatedly, "We have no obligation to 
enter into a development agreement, and the city should not do so unless it is 
getting something it could otherwise not obtain." 
</P>
<P>
Uberuaga, however, believes that the city can get a favorable deal. He said he 
will recommend approving the agreement if the land company agrees to all his 
requirements. Uberuaga said last week that he was "adamant" that the agreement 
should not exclude the developer from any new city fees in the future. The 
Huntington Beach Co. officials originally had contended that the agreement 
should relieve the developer from new fees, but the revised contract to be 
considered by the City Council tonight now contains the land company's assent 
to pay new fees. 
</P>
<P>
The land company's pledge to dedicate more parkland than state law requires of 
a developer is a major part of the proposed agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement also would give the city a new police substation, a new 
fire station, a new water reservoir and extensive road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said a major benefit would be the transformation of Holly-Seacliff itself. 
</P>
<P>
"That area now is unsightly," the mayor said. "Chevron (which wholly owns the 
Huntington Beach Co.) could leave the land the way it is for the next 10 to 15 
years because oil prices have gone up. But with this agreement, we are getting 
the oil wells removed. Holly-Seacliff, when completed, is going to be one of 
the most beautiful areas in the city."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: VINTAGE ELECTION ADVICE: DRINK UP, AND THEN VOTE FOR THE 
OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Great State of California is now engaged in a campaign to elect a governor, 
and newspapers are choosing up sides. 
</P>
<P>
The same was true in 1853 when a scamp from San Diego history named George 
Horatio Derby, a.k.a. John Phoenix and Squibob, decided to have some sport. 
</P>
<P>
Derby was an Army lieutenant and topographical engineer who had been sent to 
San Diego to tame the ever-flooding San Diego River. He also wrote satire for 
the San Diego Herald, whose editor, Judson Ames, was a loyal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
When Ames left for San Francisco (to hustle advertising) during the 
gubernatorial campaign, Derby decided to bring some ants to the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Ames stoutly favored the reelection of his friend and patron, Gov. John Bigler. 
Derby was a reformist Whig and two-fisted iconoclast. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Ames set sail, Derby endorsed the entire Whig ticket, headed by 
William Waldo. Derby called it the Phoenix Independent Ticket and warned of 
perdition if it lost. 
</P>
<P>
He also provided guidance on how voters should select their candidates, wisdom 
as good today as then: 
</P>
<P>
"The man who seeks your vote for any office by furnishing you with whiskey, 
gratis, and credit at his little shop is by no means calculated to be either a 
good maker or dispenser of the laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Drink his whiskey by all means, if you like it and he invites you, but make 
him no pledges and on the day of election, vote any other ticket than that he 
gives you." 
</P>
<P>
Bigler won the election but Waldo carried San Diego County. Derby laughed and 
moved on. 
</P>
<P>
The tale is told in the just-published "Squibob: An Early California Humorist," 
edited by Derby descendant Richard Derby Reynolds, himself a onetime San Diego 
muckraker. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that copies of the Herald carrying Derby's political advice were 
ordered by the state asylum for the insane in Stockton for its patient waiting 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Which sounds like a story that is true whether it happened or not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

* Santee City Council candidate Rick White says his city suffers from "jackass 
traffic."

<P>
The Poway Center for the Performing Arts opened its 1990-91 season Saturday 
night with an abridged/slightly askew rendering by the spoof-loving Reduced 
Shakespeare Company of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One highlight was "Titus Andronicus," normally a macabre story of children 
murdered and served as dinner to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was done as a cooking show: "Finger lickin' good." 
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: There is no accounting for taste. 
</P>
<P>
* Activism is where you find it. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Fe residents are sorely upset at the sight of historic buildings 
in their woodsy community being destroyed in the name of progress. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Paul says they've not yet gotten to the stage of laying down in front 
of bulldozers but are beginning to fight back, Rancho Santa Fe style:

A fund-raising cocktail party is set for Oct. 24 at the Rancho Santa Fe Farms 
Golf Club.

To the Selectors Go the Spoils 
</P>
<P>
There's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Republican site selection committee for the 1992 national 
convention were treated like visiting royalty last week in San Diego: stretch 
limousines, banquets, a reception at the mayor's home in Point Loma, comfy 
rooms at the Meridien Hotel in Coronado, T-shirts, Charger hats, etc. 
</P>
<P>
But if the personal touch is important, Houston may still have an edge. 
</P>
<P>
When the Republicans went to Houston, they were treated to free masseuse 
services. Free haircuts, manicures and pedicures, too.

<P>
Gerry Rymes had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning, the Corona resident spent up to half an hour waiting in traffic 
just to get to the Riverside Freeway on-ramp. Then it would take another hour 
on the freeway to get to work in Orange. By the time he got to the office, he 
already was stressed, tired and angry. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Rymes changed all that. Now when he sees clogged side streets, 
bumper-to-bumper traffic and irate drivers, he is passing it all by. By riding 
24 miles to work on a bike every day, Rymes has joined a small group of Corona 
residents who have found ways to beat the 91, arguably the worst freeway mess 
in Orange and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The dreaded Riverside Freeway is a lifeline, connecting the people who live in 
the affordable housing of western Riverside County with jobs in Orange County. 
But as houses and workplaces have sprung up, the freeway has clogged up, and 
the commuters have had to come up with innovative methods to conquer it. 
</P>
<P>
While Rymes switched to cycling, Dale Ploung and Dave Reichert fly to work 
along with two fellow employees. And one woman has found what is perhaps the 
simplest solution. She just quit her job, and never has to set her eyes on the 
traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Bicycling was just a hobby when Rymes moved to Corona almost five years ago. 
The commute was manageable then. But by 1990, more than 200,000 vehicles were 
passing through the Santa Ana corridor daily, and it could take him two hours 
to get home on a Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It just got so bad, I couldn't take it anymore," said Rymes, 39, an installer 
of 911 emergency computer systems for PRC Public Management Services Inc. in 
Orange. "I was ready to quit my job. It got to a point where I wanted to either 
walk or ride a bike." 
</P>
<P>
He opted for the two-wheel solution. Rymes said his decision was made solely to 
avoid the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a commuter, not a cyclist," he said. "I had to work up to it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I had only been in a couple of fun rides. Then a few weeks ago I was in the OC 
Classic and rode 50 miles, and I had no problem at all." 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, he starts off by passing over the Riverside Freeway at Green 
River Road in Corona, cycles to the Santa Ana Riverbed bike trail entrance at 
Green River Golf Course, rides through Featherly Park and Yorba Regional Park 
and heads on down the Santa Ana River to the Lincoln Avenue bridge in Orange. 
From there he takes city streets until he gets to PRC on Town and Country Road. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the 90-minute trek, traveling about 18 miles per hour, he never 
sees the freeway. Instead, his scenery is just the greenery of the riverbed. 
Occasionally, he rides with two other cyclists he has met since starting the 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like another world," he said. "You don't even notice that there's a 
freeway there." 
</P>
<P>
At night, he does the same, even when it is dark, wearing a light on the top of 
his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about getting into trouble with gangs or highwaymen because I'm 
usually moving too fast," he said. "What I worry about are rocks that someone 
might have thrown in the path." 
</P>
<P>
The risk at night, he said, is worth it. He gets a proud feeling passing by 
motorists at Gypsum Canyon Road, where traffic is backed up by commuters 
seeking shortcuts off the freeway. On Friday nights, and when the freeway is 
stalled more than usual, he can even beat traffic by as much as half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic will be slow enough so I can hear what they say," he said. "They will 
talk to me and say, 'I wish I had a bike.' Others would say some not so nice 
things too." 
</P>
<P>
Rymes plans to seek a reduction in his insurance premiums because he no longer 
drives his car to work. And the time he used to spend working out at a gym is 
eliminated. By commuting by bike, he said, he kills two birds with one stone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my exercise, and I don't have the stress," he said. "The best part is 
going by all those hundreds of cars." 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time Rymes pedals to work, Dale Ploung and Dave Reichert are 
flying from Corona Municipal Airport to Fullerton Municipal Airport, an 
11-minute flight that has cut down their commute to Hughes Aircraft Co. by as 
much as 75 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With soft-listening music playing on headphones, the two private pilots, along 
with two other Hughes employees, soar 3,000 feet above the Riverside Freeway 
early each morning. The sun has yet to rise, and from their point of view, the 
freeway traffic is just a quiet river of light. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say this, but the more traffic there is, the more beautiful the 
sight," Ploung said. "It's all streams of white and red. They look like 
beautiful ribbons." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fullerton Municipal Airport officials, about four groups of 
commuters fly daily into the airport, many of them pools of people who work at 
large office complexes in and near Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Ploung, 42, purchased his first plane in 1976 while he was earning his pilot's 
license. In 1982, he and three others began commuting by plane on a 
semi-regular basis, flying only when the freeway traffic was heavy. Now, the 
freeway is almost always jammed in the morning. For Ploung, what was once a 
hobby is now a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to look at the freeway and then decide," Ploung said. "Sometimes it 
wasn't bad at all. . . . But three years ago it became mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Reichert, 39, eventually got so used to flying in Ploung's pool that 
he bought his own plane three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when Dale would take off for a week, and I didn't like to 
drive," Reichert said. "I didn't want to deal with it. It would take me longer 
to get on the freeway than it would to fly to Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
Reichert bought his plane for $13,500 and Ploung his for $20,000, and each said 
his is appreciating in value. The four in the pool split the weekly fuel and 
servicing costs of $150 a week. Tie-down fees of $45 a month, and the 
$900-a-year insurance costs also are shared. 
</P>
<P>
But the savings in time is just one of the perks. It can be a gray day, but the 
commuter pool gets to see the sunshine when they ascend above the clouds. And 
at that altitude, the sights can include bird's-eye views of blimps, forest 
fires, Disneyland hot-air balloons, and, most recently, a full-circle rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
"On the freeway, it's the same roads, the sames houses, the same cars," 
Reichert said. "But if you're flying, it changes every day." 
</P>
<P>
When they land at Fullerton, all four have one mile left on their commute. They 
used to have to either hoof it or hitchhike. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to hold our Hughes badges out and get a ride with other employees," 
Ploung said. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, they pooled their money and bought a beat-up 1975 Volvo for 
$500. Now most of them leave their homes at 6:20 a.m. and are at their desks by 
6:50. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the two pilots estimate they have made 1,500 flights. 
</P>
<P>
"This is safer than cars," Reichert said. "We've never had any engines quit or 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Susanna Branch is concerned, the Riverside Freeway isn't much of a 
problem at all anymore. In July, she quit her job at the Orange County 
Environmental Management Agency in downtown Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the ultimate way to avoid the freeway," said Branch, 37, who has lived 
in Corona for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It just ate so much of my time in a non-productive way," she said. "It had a 
greater toll on me than I knew." She and her husband now are managing on one 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
When she first started commuting to Santa Ana three years ago, the drive was 70 
minutes. By last July, it was 90 minutes. That left her with little free time 
in Corona, where she was eager to become involved in community events. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told people I was leaving, no people seemed surprised," she said. 
"Everyone seemed to go, 'Yeah, I can dig it.' No one said I was wimpy."

<P>
A woman struck and killed by a train as she sat on the tracks Saturday in 
Encinitas was identified Sunday by the coroner's office as 20-year-old 
Elizabeth Diane Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was sitting on the Santa Fe Railway tracks near her home in the 330 block 
of North Vulcan Avenue when she was struck at 6:54 p.m. Saturday by the 
southbound Amtrak train, Deputy Coroner Robert Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Jones, who was seated with her on the tracks, was able to scramble 
to safety and was not hurt, said Sgt. Roy Stamper of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a maid at the Oceanview Motel in Encinitas, was killed instantly, Engel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred near Old Highway 101 where the train tracks run along a 
residential and commercial area. Authorities have yet to determine how fast the 
train was traveling.

<P>
Compared to some election races in Orange County, Fullerton's City Council race 
may seem a bit boring. After all, the race is void of any mudslinging and 
outrageous campaign charges and countercharges. 
</P>
<P>
With only three candidates -- two of them incumbents -- vying for two seats in 
the Nov. 6 election, the race has been decidedly low-key. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Fullerton City Council races have traditionally been free of 
mudslinging," said Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, who is seeking reelection. "Sure, 
we all have our philosophical differences, but we talk about them at City 
Council meetings, and the public knows where we stand. You won't find any 
skulduggery or backdoor dealing in a Fullerton City Council race." 
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates, incumbent Councilwoman Molly McClanahan and 
challenger Ray Merryman, agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Fullerton has had a long tradition of cordiality," said McClanahan, 
who is running for her third term on the City Council. "The council likes to 
deal with issues, not personalities." 
</P>
<P>
The only spark of discontent comes from Merryman -- a longtime Fullerton 
resident who unsuccessfully ran for City Council in 1988 -- but even his 
disagreements with Catlin and McClanahan remain civil. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to stick to the issues," Merryman said. "I personally believe 12 years 
on the council is nothing more than a politburo. But I like to stick to the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
Merryman said the council tends to vote the same on every issue that comes 
before it, a signal, he said, that change is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But other than fundamental differences with the council, Merryman has refrained 
from verbally attacking Catlin's or McClanahan's character. 
</P>
<P>
Though Catlin and McClanahan disagree on some issues, the two candidates agree 
on what they called Fullerton's major issues -- the economy and environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that the overall economy is slowing down and leveling out," 
Catlin said, "and this will have an effect on our city and what kind of service 
we can provide. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's revenue stream is strained. And people in Fullerton are used to 
getting good service from the city. We, as a council, must be ready to work 
with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the environment is concerned, both Catlin and McClanahan agree that 
water and air quality and the safe disposal of waste is crucial for the city. 
In addition, both said Fullerton needs to start working with other Orange 
County cities in solving these problems.FULLERTON CITY COUNCIL These are the

MEDIGAP INSURANCE DISCUSSION PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A forum to help senior citizens understand private supplemental medical 
insurance and avoid becoming victims of abusive practices is scheduled for 2:30 
to 3:30 p.m. today at the Beverly Manor in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Consumer Guidelines for Medicare and Long-Term Care Insurance," the 
forum is sponsored by the California Department of Aging's Health Insurance 
Counseling Advocacy Program. 
</P>
<P>
Directors for the advocacy program said the implementation of Medicare 25 years 
ago also opened a market for private Medicare supplementary insurance, called 
Medigap. 
</P>
<P>
"Many feel the insurance industry is taking advantage of individuals living on 
fixed incomes, using hard sales or abusive sales techniques," said Julie 
Schoen, a spokeswoman for the advocacy program. 
</P>
<P>
In the forum, senior citizens will be provided with guidelines to follow when 
purchasing Medigap insurance, as well as long-term care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The forum is provided free, and those interested in attending can call (714) 
837-8000 for more information. Beverly Manor is at 24452 Health Center Drive.

CHARGERS RELISH A RARE CHANCE TO DISH IT OUT;

PRO FOOTBALL: N.Y. JETS PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHARGERS SEIZE THEM FOR 
A SHOCKING, 39-3 VICTORY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why of course, it's just what everyone expected: Another convincing loss for a 
terrible football team. 
</P>
<P>
But smelling salts, please, for those who didn't see it and now won't believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers won. The Chargers won. 39-3. 39-3 . . . and you can get off the 
floor now -- there is a team that can play worse than the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played awful," Jets Coach Bruce Coslet said. "It was a whole team 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets (2-4) were five-point favorites and playing in front of 63,311 fans in 
Giants Stadium. They had the No. 1 offense in the AFC and were playing a 
lifeless team that had been embarrassed by Pittsburgh, 36-14, a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Go figure it," Steve Gutman, president of the Jets, told a security guard as 
Sunday's game came to a close. 
</P>
<P>
And if you do, explain this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers (2-4) recorded their largest margin of victory since beating 
the Giants, 44-7, on Oct. 19, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They scored the most points since defeating Kansas City, 42-21, on Oct. 25, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back Ronnie Harmon had not touched the ball in the previous two 
games, but he had it eight times against the Jets and on five occasions picked 
up a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After allowing Houston and Pittsburgh to be successful on 19 of 28 
third-down conversions, they limited the Jets to one for 10. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers never were forced to punt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's relief for me, and I imagine there's relief for the players," 
Coach Dan Henning said. "We did some soul-searching this week and discussed it 
with the players, and we determined there wasn't to be a great deal of change. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe in what you're doing, and you study it, and you feel like what 
you're doing is right, then you have to go out and prove it's right. That's 
what we intended to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers compiled a season-high 22 first downs, gaining 412 yards, and 
limited the Jets' high-powered attack to 148. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that's as good as we have played all year," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, defensive end Burt Grossman sacked quarterback Ken O'Brien for the 
Chargers' first safety since 1987. On offense, running back Marion Butts ripped 
off 121 yards on 26 carries, including touchdown runs of five and six yards. On 
special teams, the Chargers destroyed the Jets' punting game. 
</P>
<P>
"The players were determined to play a game as a team, and they did that," 
Henning said. "We were a determined team today because of what has happened to 
us the last couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were left short at the goal line on their first possession after 
failing on four downs to bully their way into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets took possession at their own one, and on third and four from the 
seven, the Charger pass rush fell on top of O'Brien for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing free kick, Charger running back Darrin Nelson slipped, and Jet 
cornerback Michael Mayes recovered the ball at the San Diego 14. 
</P>
<P>
Along the sideline, the Charger defense began slapping each other on the back 
as if disaster was just what they wanted. "Gill Byrd and those guys were 
high-fiving each other before they went onto the field," defensive coordinator 
Ron Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
"You never want something bad to happen, but that's the situation we wanted. We 
talked about that, that's something in past years we've been able to do. Not to 
just survive, but come out of bad situations without giving up points. We're 
disappointed they got the field goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets settled for one by Pat Leahy from 22 yards, and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it," Byrd said. "As a defense, we took the field like we were 
there to stop people. It was an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
The defense eventually forced O'Brien from the game with an ankle injury, and 
the Charger offense marched forward unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play of the second quarter, quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver found 
coverage he liked on wide receiver Anthony Miller and dropped a 29-yard 
touchdown pass into Miller's hands for a 9-3 lead. It was Miller's fourth 
touchdown catch of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to throw a screen to Butts or a post to Miller, but they had him 
pressed at the line in man-to-man coverage," said Tolliver, who completed 12 of 
18 for 169 yards without an interception. "We needed a win, that's for sure. 
And I needed a game like this. I felt like I played a smart game, and I didn't 
do anything stupid for a change." 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense continued its assault on the Jets and pinned them back to 
the New York 11. On fourth down, punter Joe Prokop retreated in his own end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought we'd tried to block it because we haven't done a lot on punt 
returns," said Larry Pasquale, the special teams coordinator who was fired by 
the Jets after last season. "Craig McEwen was in there because Vencie Glenn had 
been hurt, and he was right in the right spot." 
</P>
<P>
McEwen came in untouched on Prokop. Prokop, the Charger punter during the 1987 
strike, opted to not kick the ball into McEwen's chest and took off running, 
only to be dropped at the five. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Butts swept right for the touchdown and a 16-3 lead. The 
Chargers added field goals of 34 and 42 yards by John Carney and went to the 
locker room with a 22-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, they took 7:34 off the clock on their opening possession 
and scored on Butts' six-yard burst up the middle. After Byrd intercepted a 
Tony Eason pass, Carney was successful from 37 yards, and it was time for the 
locals to head for the New Jersey Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is we didn't stop the run," Jet linebacker Jeff Lageman said. 
"To hell with the pass, they could run the ball all day on us." 
</P>
<P>
With a 32-3 third-quarter lead, Tolliver and Butts were given the afternoon 
off. But the Chargers lost nothing in the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Vlasic, two of three for 31 yards, handed off to running back 
Rod Bernstine, and Bernstine beat his way through a New York subway crowd to 
score on a 40-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are given the opportunity, you always try to make something happen," 
said Bernstine, who is averaging 5.6 yards a carry. "And so far, I've been 
answering the bell." 
</P>
<P>
As for the schizophrenic Chargers, who have been at their worst and their best 
in a span of seven days, there is now an upcoming date with the AFC West 
Division-leading Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"This victory is a step forward," linebacker Gary Plummer said. "We're still 
2-4, but there's a feeling now we're moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>

GRETZKY THRIVING IN AN UNLIKELY SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HERRMANN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "zillions of possibilities" in every hockey game, as he calls them, help 
make Wayne Gretzky so fascinating to watch and difficult to follow. A center 
who eschews conventional skate-it-up-the-middle strategy, Gretzky regularly 
surfaces along the sideboards, behind the net or at the edge of the crease. As 
he likes to say: "I go where the puck is going, not where it was." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of prescient adaptability has made a most unlikely move now seem 
perfectly natural. He has elevated a team that always was closer to Mexico than 
to the Stanley Cup. He has added luster to a franchise that still hasn't won so 
much as a division title or a second playoff round. He has created a widespread 
following for the Los Angeles Kings, whose former owner, Jack Kent Cooke, once 
reportedly commented on Southern California's 600,000 Canadian expatriates: 
"Now I know why they moved out here. They hate hockey." 
</P>
<P>
"Hockey has caught on here," Gretzky said after practice one day last week. 
"People want to see it, they want to watch it. It's abuzz right now. Everywhere 
you go, kids are playing roller hockey outside. There's always groups 
petitioning to get more rinks built." 
</P>
<P>
More and more, as Gretzky begins his third year in Los Angeles, the Kings have 
the look of America's team in Canada's game. 
</P>
<P>
Kings' merchandise outsells that of any other NHL team nationwide. It has 
sprouted three team-operated memorabilia shops in and around Los Angeles. They 
had 36 sellouts last season. They drew nearly 26,000 for a preseason game in 
St. Petersburg last month. Their games are televised regularly in Phoenix and 
Honolulu, and their 10-station radio network is anchored by a flagship so 
strong that it can be heard at home by Edmonton Oilers' owner Peter 
Pocklington, whose cash-flow crisis prompted The Trade on Aug. 9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Three months short of his 30th birthday, Gretzky is encouraged about his team, 
content with his family and six-bedroom home in Los Angeles, and undaunted that 
his former team won the Stanley Cup without him last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Their challenge was to win a championship without Wayne Gretzky. My challenge 
was to help hockey go here and win a championship here," he said. "I think that 
I've got one of my two." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a third, one that might be called Gretzky's greatest challenge: 
Can Gretzky's popularity sustain the Kings even after Gretzky is gone? Time and 
the Kings' performance will determine whether hockey is a fad or a fixture in 
the Forum. It is an issue before team management, which is considering the 
future while trying to figure out how to advance past the Smythe Division 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question made more pertinent by Gretzky's physical condition and age. 
He has withstood a great deal of punishment in his 12 pro seasons. Not the 
least of which was the cross-check from behind by the Islanders' Alan Kerr in 
March. The resulting back injury kept Gretzky out for most of the playoffs. 
Although he recovered with a summer of situps, he acknowledges the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can play for a long time, so my kids can come to the rink, watch the 
games and really understand what's going on," said the father of Paulina, 2, 
and Ty, three months. "But, unfortunately they won't. By the time they're 5 or 
6, well, that's five or six more years." 
</P>
<P>
After that, it is anyone's guess as to whether Sylvester Stallone and Tony 
Danza still will have seats right behind the glass, Paula Abdul will show up as 
guest of a player's wife, the lead singer from New Kids on the Block will be 
dining at the owner's table or thousands of others will be standing and 
shouting every time the red light goes on and the loudspeakers project a chorus 
of "I Love L.A." 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to forget what happened to the can't-miss soccer interest in New 
York once Pele left the Cosmos (and after Giorgio Chinaglia temporarily kept 
the fire burning). To put it in Hollywood terms -- with apologies to longtime 
Kings fan Jamie Farr, the former Corporal Klinger -- could "M.A.S.H." have gone 
on without Hawkeye? 
</P>
<P>
There are mixed opinions on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had a problem when I was a kid, getting people to come to (Kings) 
games. But once they came, they were hooked. That's the reason why I think 
people will be coming back long after Wayne's gone," said Bruce McNall, the 
Kings' owner, who paid the Oilers $15 million plus Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas 
and three first-round draft picks to acquire Gretzky, Marty McSorley and Mike 
Krushelnyski. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we're bringing people in, we're letting them in on the excitement 
and the enthusiasm of the game," McNall said before leaving for Paris, where he 
watched a horse he co-owns with Gretzky win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, 
Europe's richest horse race. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, there is this sentiment about local hockey interest from a Forum 
employee: "It's going to degenerate. You know how it is here, people just go 
with whatever's hot." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Miller, the team's television announcer for the past 17 years, has heard 
the latter attitude more than once. "Most people are saying once this guy's 
gone, that's going to be it," he said. "But I like to at least be positive 
about it and say people are going to at least come out and see what an exciting 
game it is regardless of whether he's here or not." 
</P>
<P>
People who have been around the Kings for any length of time cannot help but 
have positive feelings. With due respect to forwards Marcel Dionne and Bob 
Berry, who starred for the Kings in the 1970s, and goaltender Rogie Vachon, who 
was named The Hockey News player of the year for leading the Kings to a 
105-point season in 1974-75, hockey is a whole new ballgame in Los Angeles now. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any respect in the sports community here until we made the big 
trade," said Vachon, beginning his seventh season as Kings' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the players were feted by a crowd of 900 at the downtown Biltmore 
Hotel three days before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In a bow to last season's franchise-record average attendance of 15,707, the 
Kings decided to display fans, not Gretzky or a teammate, on the cover of their 
media guide. 
</P>
<P>
On his part in fitting hockey into many sun-drenched lifestyles, Gretzky said: 
"I think I've helped change some of the habits, but I don't think I've been 
totally responsible for that. I think the management and ownership of the 
organization have been very responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Who's he kidding? 
</P>
<P>
"He is the Babe Ruth of his time. The impact he had on Edmonton was dramatic 
and the impact he's had on Los Angeles is dramatic," said Paul Staudohar, 
professor of business administration at California State University, Hayward, 
who has published two books on economics and sport. "I really can't think of a 
player who has had that much of an impact. Of course, Babe Ruth did when he 
went to the Yankees from Boston." 
</P>
<P>
And the Kings' outlook? 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky insists his team shows long-term promise. "They're hitting where they 
have to hit: the young people. Those are the ones who are coming to the games 
and they're eventually going to bring their kids to the games," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this franchise is going to be very solid and successful for years to 
come," said a player renowned for his foresight.

EXPERTS TRY TO FIND REASONS FOR INCREASING FAN VIOLENCE AROUND WORLD 
</P>

<P>
Shane Geringer went to a Raiders game last month, took off his shirt, got some 
sun, had a few beers and then, police said, kicked another fan into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Almost routine, claim behaviorists who have studied the incident. Apart from 
the degree of injury, they said, bleacher blows are thrown just about 
everywhere every Sunday. And in terms of drive-by shootings and terrorist 
bombings, they added, football punch-ups barely quiver the needle on today's 
gauges of calculated human violence. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, say psychologists, sociologists and lawyers, the incident at the 
Coliseum fills the paradigm for a now all too common disorder: fan violence. 
</P>
<P>
Consider its parameters: 
</P>
<P>
* Geringer, who will be arraigned on felony assault and battery charges today 
in Los Angeles Municipal Court, was described by his Los Angeles lawyer as "a 
fanatic Raider fan." Attorney Leslie Abramson also said her client has had a 
drinking problem since age 13. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a bad mix, a dangerous mix . . . the lowering of inhibitions with 
alcohol and the lifting of excitement by being a rabid sports fan," noted 
Richard Lister, a Costa Mesa sports psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
* Geringer was in a crowd of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It is known that in mob scenes, people do all sorts of things that they 
wouldn't do alone," said David Phillips, a professor of social science at UC 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* Geringer's attack on Paul Albrecht, a Pittsburgh supporter now recovering 
from head injuries, occurred in the fourth quarter of the Steeler's 20-3 loss 
to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"These fights just don't happen," commented Ira Reiner, Los Angeles district 
attorney and follower of professional football since 1946 and the Rams' first 
game in Los Angeles. "They are invariably the culmination of three quarters of 
increasingly rowdy behavior . . . that is tolerated (and) that finally ends up 
in a fight sometime around the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
* Geringer is 19. He recently left high school and lives on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical fan rioter is around 20," said Jerry M. Lewis, professor of 
sociology at Kent State, Ohio, a global expert and author on crowd behavior and 
sports violence. "Then there is what I call the Alienation Hypothesis as the 
young white male becomes estranged from his institutional ties. Family. School. 
Work. Church. Where he (then) identifies is with his peer group . . . and that 
is what accounts for gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"But why sports? Well, sports becomes a medium to express an identification 
with a team, and to your fellows. Very seldom do sports rioters act without an 
audience. And so the audience provides them with a sense of meaning to reduce 
the alienation." 
</P>
<P>
The facts of this international matter of sports violence have written some 
violent box scores. 
</P>
<P>
Brussels, 1985: Thirty-nine dead, 520 injured during a European Cup soccer 
riot. Detroit, 1984: One dead, 80 injured celebrating the Detroit Tigers' 
victory in the World Series. Detroit, 1990: Eight killed, 127 injured after the 
Pistons win the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, only programs and suggestions were thrown at umpires, players and 
rival fans. In the present, from Beijing to Tiger Stadium, from Seoul to the 
Montreal Forum, acid, bricks, seats, urine, rocks, pipe bombs, firecrackers and 
feces are being tossed. 
</P>
<P>
And in Los Angeles last week, fears of crowd violence rose high enough for 
Coliseum and Raider management to impose a one-day ban on beer sales Sunday -- 
with clear hints that fighting fans are on probation, and permanent 
restrictions on beer sales are a definite consideration. 
</P>
<P>
There is a consensus among sociologists -- including the late Irving Goldaber 
of Miami, founder of the Center for Study of Crowd and Spectator Behavior -- 
that sports violence is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found the line to explosiveness is being crossed more and more," wrote 
consultant Goldaber in a report authored shortly before his death in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kent State's Lewis -- although emphasizing that even soccer hooliganism is an 
isolated ill and its social severity small compared to street crimes -- 
believes the nation's next Kent State-type confrontation "will be at a sports 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't reached the point yet . . . but it may be coming." 
</P>
<P>
When or if it comes, it is unlikely to add anything new to centuries of deep 
research into sports thuggery -- but make that more than a millenium of study. 
</P>
<P>
For it was at chariot races in AD 532, that fans joined furies and forces in 
what may well have been the first crowd protest over bad officiating. They 
demanded the resignation of several start-finish judges. Riots roiled for 
several days before fans of the Ben Hur Division asked their emperor to 
intervene. Or they would overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
The emperor did respond. Troops were called to disperse the mob. And 30,000 
sports fans died. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 1,400 years, countless theorem and theses, learned papers and 
half-baked hypotheses have attempted to analyze the causes that degrade 
friendly rivalry into fatal confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, sociologists Moshe Semyonov and Mira Farbstein of Tel Aviv 
University wrote that sports violence is indeed characteristic of social 
systems. "Teams representing communities of subordinate ethnic minorities are 
more violent than others . . . and teams characterized by violent players are 
more likely to have violent spectators," they said. 
</P>
<P>
* In similar vein, a team of British researchers at the University of Leicester 
said its studies suggested sports violence exemplifies "the lower social class 
where violence has become a legitimate expression of masculine aggression among 
youthful peers. Participants are usually from the lower working class and aged 
17-21." 
</P>
<P>
* In a 1981 paper, Prof. Jay J. Coakley of the University of Colorado blamed 
commercialization of professional sports and promotion of "heroic values . . . 
including violence to generate spectator interest" for fights among players and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
"For many sports teams, especially heavy contact teams controlled by repressive 
behavior codes, violence becomes a means for players to maintain their 
identities and self-esteem," Coakley concluded. "Player violence provides a 
model of aggressive behavior for fans and sometimes serves as a catalyst for 
spectator violence." 
</P>
<P>
* Researchers at the University of Massachusetts showed films of selected 
football plays to an equal number of male and female students and found: "The 
enjoyment of plays increased with the degree of their apparent 
roughness/violence for male viewers only." 
</P>
<P>
* Sociologist Phillips of UC San Diego collated crime statistics after 1973-78 
heavyweight boxing matches. After each bout, he discovered, homicides increased 
by 12.4% suggesting that "prizefights stimulate fatal, aggressive behavior in 
some Americans." 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Smith, a Canadian sociologist at York University, Ontario, examined a 
decade of hockey violence and found crowd violence "was precipitated by player 
violence in 74% of the cases." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer hooligans, says a European scientist, are really exercising ancient 
instincts for tribal warfare -- and that whenever England plays West Germany, 
crowd conflicts are a psychological replay of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Football thugs, says a behaviorist on this side of the Atlantic, are often 
roused by the media and advance publicity that elevates a simple sporting 
contest into a spectacle of inter-city passions. 
</P>
<P>
But at a tennis match, only peace breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a critical-mass problem," Lewis explained. "You have to have a critical 
mass of support before you generate this small universe of demonstrators." 
</P>
<P>
Nor has there ever been a golf riot. Because, Lister noted, it is a gentle 
sport that attracts gentle followers. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball and basketball games, acknowledge the experts, are not without fan 
fights. But numbers and severity are reduced because baseball and basketball 
are not considered contact sports. 
</P>
<P>
Further, said Mike Williams, spokesman for the Los Angeles Dodgers, "the Dodger 
experience is calculated to be entertainment for the family." 
</P>
<P>
Tailgate parties, he continued, are not allowed at Dodger Stadium. There are 
restrictions on beer sales and 6,000 stadium seats are set aside as a 
no-drinking area. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is one sport where spectator violence is on a gentle par with 
punch-ups at a chess match: Professional wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrestling is stylistic aggression," Lewis explained. "It's a parody, it is 
ritualized, and therefore the fans are ritualized. They may yell terrible 
things at the wrestlers. But they know it is all orchestrated." 
</P>
<P>
But at Raider games, said attorney Abramson, player contact is genuine, hard 
and the team image seems to be "deliberately set on a violent and hate-filled 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the pirate image is not promoted the way Peter Pan's pirate image . 
. . is promoted," she said, "but as a really bruise 'em, kill 'em, crunch 'em 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Shane Geringer, she said, may have thrown a punch. 
</P>
<P>
"But I really hold the management of the team responsible," Abramson continued. 
"I think they encourage poor sportsmanship, hatred instead of good 
sportsmanlike rivalry. And here comes a 19-year-old kid (Geringer) who is being 
blamed for what these business-promoting grown-ups have been pushing on the 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
Al LoCasale, executive assistant with the Raiders, denies the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean that the lions promote eating the Christians?" he asked. "A former 
head coach of Michigan State used to say: 'In the good old days, dancing was a 
contact sport. Football is a collision sport.' But I don't think that has very 
much to do with it (fan violence)." 
</P>
<P>
LoCasale believes that aggression and hostility among football spectators is a 
simple reflection of aggression and hostility in today's society. 
</P>
<P>
He is not convinced that inner-city and blue-collar environments are farm clubs 
for sports thugs. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest fight I ever saw at a football game, ever, was the Penn-Princeton 
game in 1947, where the city of Philadelphia had to bring out their mounted 
police," he said. "You are talking about two of the (nation's) greatest 
academic institutions . . . the breeding ground of gentlemen, of Presidents. 
And in a stadium where they did not sell alcoholic beverages." 
</P>
<P>
Excessive drinking, said LoCasale, is indeed one factor in fan violence -- but 
it's the drinking at tailgate parties before the game and outside the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not surprise me if there was not more alcohol consumed before people 
get into the stadium than while they are at the stadium," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet LoCasale has little time for psychologists who analyze his sport "to make a 
buck by having an opinion that is uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people who attend one game every 12 years and then tell you exactly 
what is wrong with the sport," he said. "They wouldn't know, in many cases, 
whether we put air in the football or whether we stuff it with feathers." 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Reiner believes that major violence occurs at football games 
because minor rowdyism is tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
"I take my (12-year-old) son to these games . . . and there some bum stands up 
and he shouts as loud as he can down to the field: ' . . . you.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know what happens to him? Not a . . . thing. He keeps on drinking 
beer . . . that vulgar behavior goes on continually and near the fourth quarter 
he gets mad at somebody and the two of them get into a fight." 
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problem, continued Reiner, rests with overlapping 
considerations: Game attendance and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Hostile behavior is not tolerated at baseball games, he said, because "people 
would stop bringing their kids . . . and if people stopped bringing their 
families, attendance would drop decidedly. 
</P>
<P>
"But at pro football games, it is not a family crowd. If people stopped 
bringing their families it would not have a consequential impact on their 
(Raider) attendance. Therefore, they are not motivated nor interested in seeing 
that this behavior does not go on." 
</P>
<P>
LoCosale denies Reiner's point. He said his organization is dedicated to giving 
patrons a "Sunday at a Raider game as something that puts them in the comfort 
zone, something that is an exciting and enjoyable experience." 
</P>
<P>
Beer sales and policing of crowds, he said, are regular concerns of Raider 
management -- but so are "better parking, a stadium with better sight lines, 
better restrooms. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
LoCasale also suggested a new view of the Geringer incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had one serious injury with 5.2 million people in the stadium in 84 
home dates," he said. "I have had someone . . . say to me that this (Geringer) 
is a major incident just because the photographers and the TV people were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it is not a national cause celebre." 
</P>
<P>
The underpinnings of negative crowd behavior, Phillips asserts, are 
multilayered. Alcohol. Youth. Individual aggression levels. Urban environment. 
Even open terraces that invite overcrowding. And influences of the media. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a classic . . . theory by (European sociologist) Georg Simmel . . . 
that very frequently, conflict was a way to solidify group solidarity and 
sharpen the boundaries between two groups," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
So in their "very effective" efforts to reinforce team and city identities, he 
explained, sports writers and broadcasters will "simulate conflict between 
those two cities and those two teams." 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity, Phillips added, becomes a byproduct of that conflict. So does 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
It is also patently bad box office, he said, to promote a football, basketball, 
baseball, hockey or boxing match as anything but intense competition between 
individuals or cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the game) is not sold as a business," Phillips said. "You don't have 
people say: 'Let's go see Pepsi-Cola fight Coca-Cola.' You think of it as us 
against them and, unfortunately, a very standard part of us against them is 
conflict between us and them." 
</P>
<P>
All of which has led Phillips to construct a model football fan. She would be a 
young, middle-class teetotaler who doesn't read newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," Phillips mused, "such a person might not be interested in a 
football game anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis -- a dedicated researcher who believes in studying soccer hooliganism 
among crowds at European matches -- sees a distinction between riots. 
</P>
<P>
One is punishment. The other celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in Brussels, during the fatal riots of 1985, English fans 
"punished the Italian fans, ahead of time, before the game, and said: 'We are 
going to out-support you and, ergo, help our team.' 
</P>
<P>
"With the celebration riot, it doesn't help them (supporters) win because they 
have already won. But it gives them a sense of identity and the sport becomes 
the medium for getting this identity. 
</P>
<P>
"And if, all of a sudden, tiddlywinks was our national sport, we would have 
tiddlywink hooligans." 
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the quadrennial World Cup soccer championship will be played in 12 
American cities. The Coliseum, the Rose Bowl and Stanford University, Palo 
Alto, are among possible West Coast sites. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the importation of soccer hooliganism, said Keith Walker of the 
Colorado-based U.S. Soccer Federation, "banning alcohol (at matches) is a 
consideration" and "extensive (security) discussions" have already begun at 
federal levels of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he has been consulted by representatives of cities interested in 
World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
He has suggested concentrating matches in the Midwest and on the West Coast 
"and that would be a great deterrent to hooligans to travel that far." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some will travel that far and Lewis thinks there will be problems. But not 
with fans. "The problem is going to come with American police who are 
underprepared to handle big-time European soccer and European soccer fans," he 
said. "In fact, I think the soccer fans will make common cause." 
</P>
<P>
His current advice to law enforcers is to keep guns to a minimum. Local police 
should also "learn the culture of the soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they are marching through the center of town singing 'Here we go, 
here we go,' they are not starting a riot. They are just celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he has visited London's Wembley Stadium and has been elated and 
stirred by the surging roar of a First Division soccer crowd. But the sound was 
of massive energy, he said, not mass anger. 
</P>
<P>
Therein his final advice to World Cup security forces: "Get thee to Wembley." 
</P>
<P>
LoCasale of the Raiders said he would like to see a softening of some 
television promotions of professional football. Such as recent messages for the 
Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers game. 
</P>
<P>
"The network hyping the game was talking about this intense rivalry you will 
see on 'Sunday, Bloody Sunday,' " he said. "I think that is an improper way to 
hype." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Abramson suggests Coliseum vendors pay greater attention "to the ID of 
the people they are selling beer to. 
</P>
<P>
"Had it been done in this case, Shane (Geringer) wouldn't have been drinking 
beer at the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Lister says professional sports management should start realizing 
that hooliganism "is a turnoff to more sophisticated fans and educated people." 
</P>
<P>
But to some, there is little to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Chicago columnist Mike Royko wrote of the airy causes and 
none too subtle effects of sports violence. 
</P>
<P>
His careful conclusion: "A drunken bum is a drunken bum."

<P>
It was a blazing hot morning and the only sane place to be outdoors was at the 
beach. The asphalt island that separates Fairfax Avenue from Genesee Avenue, 
just north of the Santa Monica freeway, would top any list of places not to be. 
It was a little patch of ugliness: no shade; noxious traffic hurtling by 
nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
And yet at 10 a.m. about 50 young people and a handful of adults were 
converging on this spot, some pulling bright orange road-crew vests over their 
T-shirts, others helping to unload pickaxes, sledgehammers and crowbars from 
the back of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Ilya Pokusaev, 19, of Moscow, lifted a pickax, shrugged and announced with dry 
humor, "We are proletarians." Ronnie Tucker, a burly 16-year-old from 
inner-city Washington, D.C., was authoritatively telling a crestfallen David 
Pinon, a 14-year-old from West Los Angeles, "No, you cannot use the 
sledgehammer. You're too weak, man." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Pinon was hacking at the asphalt with a pickax. Wendy Crooks, 
18, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, her skin reddening and freckling by the 
minute, studied the implements uncertainly for a moment and got to work. Two 
young women from Novosibirsk, Siberia, staggered together, giggling, under the 
weight of the chunks they were hauling to a wheelbarrow. Tucker swung a crowbar 
into a huge slab that Pokusaev and Andrew Kennedy, 20, of Belfast, had pried 
loose. It split in two as Pokusaev and Kennedy let out exaggerated "wows" in 
admiration of Tucker's macho feat. 
</P>
<P>
The young people worked steadily, stopping only for cigarette breaks, escaping 
to the shade of the trees that dot the yards of the modest, neatly kept houses 
on Genesee. By 11:30, not a piece of asphalt remained. The island was now a 
dirt expanse, waiting to be be planted. By week's end, the group would return 
and plant 64 low-growing juniper shrubs and a liquid amber tree, with a second 
liquid amber due to arrive in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Earthstewards are in town and they are planting "urban peace trees." It is 
a grass-roots effort if there ever was one, except in this case the grass roots 
are global. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, 25 young people from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Soviet Union, 
Southern India, Northern Ireland and inner-city Washington, D.C., joined 25 Los 
Angeles-area youths, described by organizers as "inner-city teens." They have 
been staying at the Presbyterian Conference Center in Pacific Palisades, a 
campsite off Sunset Boulevard that is instant wilderness, where they are being 
trained in leadership, team building, cross-cultural communication, 
environmental issues and tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the young people come from some rough places, have seen hard times and 
violence, and face bleak or precarious futures. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish kids, for example, out of school at age 16, invariably described 
themselves as unemployed, with few prospects for jobs. All of the young people 
came to Los Angeles through groups previously associated with Earthstewards 
work. The Irish were selected through their involvement with a Belfast program 
that works with underprivileged Protestant and Catholic youngsters. The 
Washington teen-agers came from that city's "Youth at Risk" program, which 
seeks to intervene positively with young people from high-crime environments. 
</P>
<P>
The Earthstewards Network, "an international peace and environmental service 
organization," was founded by Danaan Parry in 1980 and operates out of Seattle. 
Parry, who runs his group with forceful good cheer and wary observation, said 
he is a former nuclear physicist who worked at Livermore Laboratories for seven 
years until he decided that whatever the particular research, it was all going 
toward "building a better bomb." He became a clinical psychologist, 
concentrating on conflict resolution, and started Earthstewards, engaging in 
"citizen diplomacy" visits that characterized many peace group efforts of the 
1980s. He moved into the more tangible tree-planting effort in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Parry has organized similar programs in India, Costa Rica and Washington, D.C. 
Locally, the young people were co-sponsored by the L.A. Conservation Corps and 
TreePeople, who helped locate sites, organize community support and train the 
group. The Earthstewards leave Los Angeles on Thursday, having planted trees in 
Griffith Park at Dante's View, watered and nurtured dying trees along Martin 
Luther King Boulevard in South Central Los Angeles, done more planting in 
Pacoima, and transformed the median island on Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fairfax location last week, Dolores Reece, a community activist from the 
area who calls herself a "citizen forester," stood watching in happy disbelief. 
She'd been trying to get something done since 1987, she said, and had almost 
given up on the Fairfax island when this help came along. 
</P>
<P>
To the international effort was added local support funds from KRTH radio 
station and Quintessence perfume company. And club sandwiches, sweet potato 
chips, green apples and banana coconut cake for lunch that day came from City 
Restaurant, one of several dozen local restaurants providing meals for the 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been three unrelieved weeks of poster-perfect "see how these 
wonderful young people from around the world live and work peacefully 
together," although that is certainly one of the lofty goals of Earthstewards. 
Parry said the ultimate goal is "to teach youth what is possible through 
understanding and cooperation and to show them that each of them is capable of 
making a positive difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
About the experience in Los Angeles, Parry said, "It's been as expected. These 
are at-risk kids. This is not Huntington Beach. We just have to create more and 
more situations where they can get beyond their stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Their stuff is tough, and they wear a lot of their experiences visibly. It goes 
beyond the jarring first impression of seeing so many "environmentalists" 
working with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths. Many have "show me" or 
"says who" attitudes. Like most youths, they balk at rules and resist being 
ordered around. Yet those few who have been given some authority, a new 
experience, tend to become bossy. 
</P>
<P>
It is an occasion where the adults seem more idealistic and starry eyed than 
the young people. It is the adults who offer relentless good cheer and upbeat 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those in the international group had never been to the United States 
before. Now they are dropped into fabled Los Angeles, living in a church camp, 
working in the sun, and following orders. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Prokopenko, 19, a geology student from Novosibirsk, seemed to give voice 
to more than his own frustration when asked about the experience. "There is a 
difference between this camp and America," he said. "There are such strong 
restrictions. It's a bad experience. I passed this experience already in my own 
country, in Pioneer camps. They were children's gulags. I never expected to 
meet it here. I'm surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Prokopenko was by no means writing off the whole experience, however. He was 
working hard that day, was friendly and cooperative. Besides, he said, they had 
had a relatively free weekend in San Diego. "We had a few days without schedule 
and I felt that I was making my reality." 
</P>
<P>
And, scheduled promises for a boat ride, some free time, a concert and 
Disneyland lay ahead. Spirits seemed high and the young people seemed at least 
tolerant of each other, often forming affectionate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he liked everybody, David Pinon pointed out his "real good friend," 
nodding his head admiringly in the direction of an older youth. "See that guy, 
Vadim from Moscow? He's an Afghan vet." In general, Pinon said, he got along 
well with the people from Russia. His bowed head not concealing a dimpled, 
sheepish smile, he explained, "I thought they would be, like, mean." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, work had slacked off, and most of the Earthstewards had 
turned themselves into a tangled pile of bodies, using each other for pillows, 
as they sprawled on a lawn across from the median. The temperature was in the 
high 90s and Parry had ordered the bus to come early and make a stop at the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Cruz, a 16-year-old from Los Angeles, staggered out of the sun and 
threw herself, laughing, on the ground and up against the chest of Belfast's 
Kennedy, 20. He folded his arms around her and said with a smile, "We've known 
each other a week. We're sister and brother." 
</P>
<P>
Wanting a drink of Kennedy's water, Cruz discovered it was gone, so, in her 
newly acquired Irish brogue, said, "Why, you've drunk every little drop of it, 
Andy."

Richard Katkov and Miriam Mulder, a husband-and-wife architectural team 
struggling to establish a practice in a studio behind their modest Mar Vista 
house, are a couple of the '90s. But they find the experience of living and 
working together "almost medieval." 
</P>
<P>
"One thin door separates home and office," Mulder said, "just as, in the Middle 
Ages, families lived behind the workshop. This arrangement, I feel, eliminates 
the schizophrenia between home life and work life that most people suffer 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The converted garage that serves as their studio is painted white and crammed 
with drafting tables, bookshelves, architectural models and plans. It has the 
air of an adult playroom. And when the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Amelia, 
comes home from nursery school, she loves to tinker with the models before her 
mother takes her into the kitchen to make supper. 
</P>
<P>
"Architecture is such a consuming passion, it can swallow up your life," Katkov 
said. "Living and working under the same roof allows us to be close to one 
another and to Amelia without having to shift emotional gears." 
</P>
<P>
Katkov and Mulder, one of a handful of husband-and-wife architectural teams in 
the Los Angeles area, met while studying at the Southern California Institute 
of Architecture in Santa Monica. After working in other offices, they decided 
to set up their own in late 1986. They began with a few residential remodeling 
commissions handed down by Fred Fisher, an established avant-garde Santa Monica 
architect for whom Mulder once worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred's generosity gave us a kick-start," Mulder said. "At least 50% of the 
work we started out with came from his office." 
</P>
<P>
The first major commercial project the couple completed on Venice's Electric 
Avenue came from a client Fisher introduced. David Hendler, a garment 
manufacturer and developer, liked the way the young designers remodeled his 
house, so he gave them the commission to convert a derelict plumbing supply 
warehouse into a small office block. 
</P>
<P>
1611 Electric Avenue is situated on the edge of a workshop district wedged 
between Abbott Kinney Boulevard (formerly Washington Boulevard) and the Oakwood 
residential area. In recent years, several rundown concrete-block buildings off 
Electric Avenue have been converted into cheap but fashionably designed office 
space for small TV, film and advertising production agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual shape of the two-story block structure -- a rectangle with one 
angled side -- suggested to Mulder the image of an old-fashioned camera 
obscura, the most primitive camera form. This image, which graphically suggests 
the films and commercials produced by the building's tenants, gave her a simple 
design strategy to transform the homely old structure into a handsome and 
lively presence. 
</P>
<P>
Following the notion of a camera obscura theme -- essentially a box with a hole 
in it -- Mulder cut a vertical "lens" slot into one side of the building. This 
slot frames the view of a billboard-style sculpture covered with relics of the 
derelict cars and other industrial trash found in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Another "lens" is created by the free-standing, zinc-covered screen in front of 
the building's main entry. The metallic surface of the screen plays off the 
gray stucco and black-framed steel windows of the main facade. 
</P>
<P>
Within the building, rust-colored steel beams and angles suggest the focusing 
rays projected by the metaphoric lenses. These rays focus on the tilted wall of 
the main sky-lit stairwell, which in turn mimics a light-sensitive plate upon 
which the external images are "projected." 
</P>
<P>
"So much energy and thought have gone into this small act of architecture," 
Mulder said. "Even now I lie awake thinking about all the things that weren't 
done the way I wanted, or that I could've done better. It's really painful and 
exhausting." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as hurt by such things," her husband said. "Miriam is very intense. 
She's the main designer in this partnership, and I tend to manage the projects, 
or we administer them together. Temperamentally, we complement one another, 
which is why it works so well, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Mulder, 36, has intense green eyes and a pale face that is reddened by a blush 
of enthusiasm whenever she talks of architecture. Katkov, 37, is tall, dark and 
more relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a talented couple," said client Hendler, "and they're also easy to 
work with -- an unusual combination of virtues among designers." 
</P>
<P>
Hendler, a South African who has completed several small office conversions in 
Johannesburg, London and Sydney, speaks from a long history of dealing with 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
"Miriam and Richard have very specific aesthetic notions, yet they are flexible 
enough to respond to the limitations such small-scale remodeling projects 
require," he said. "Some of this flexibility has to do with their sophisticated 
appreciation of the crude muscularity of old industrial buildings such as the 
one on Electric Avenue, and their willingness to work with this quality rather 
than mask it." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Fisher, who first met Mulder when she was his student at the Southern 
California Institute of Architecture, described her talent as "poetic and 
vigorous," and her personality as "thoroughly enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
"Miriam was one of my best students, and I was happy to have her in my studio," 
Fisher said. "Clients liked her energy and her commitment. She has a lot of 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said that Mulder and Katkov are among some younger architects to whom he 
refers projects too small for his personal attention. And, like some other 
leading designers of his generation, Fisher believes fresh young talents should 
be encouraged and supported by their elders. 
</P>
<P>
Talent aside, the struggle young architects face to make a living can be 
crushing. Despite critical acclaim and the appreciation of their peers and 
mentors, many young designers live on personal incomes as meager as $1,000 a 
month while working up to 80 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd wanted to make a decent living after five years of college, I'd have 
become an attorney or an MBA," Katkov said. "Architects have to satisfy 
themselves with passion, not bread." 
</P>
<P>
"The financial uncertainty can be frightening," Mulder said, "especially for 
me. I'm a mom as well as an architect, and as I watch my daughter playing, I 
sometimes think all this is a real indulgence. But I simply couldn't see myself 
doing anything else."

<P>
NEW CHANNEL 51 NEWSCAST IS LIKE RETURN TO THE OLD DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For San Diegans accustomed to male models and beauty queens delivering the 
nightly news, KUSI-TV's (Channel 51) new 10 p.m. newscast is quite a shock. It 
is almost like entering a time warp, returning to a simpler time when Tricky 
Dick and Barry Manilow were rising stars and television news people were all 
radio veterans who thought mousse was a ballplayer for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
It is certainly no accident that Channel 51 has decided to entrust its first 
foray into news to two male anchors in their sixties. By definition, the 10 
p.m. newscast is aimed at an older, early-to-bed crowd, the folks not quite 
willing or able to stay up until 11 p.m. to watch the news. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the most popular 10 p.m. newscast is easily the Channel 5 news 
veteran program led by Hal Fishman, who is definitely not a male model. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 51 news director Peter Jacobus says the KUSI team of George Reading and 
Roger Grimsby is designed to appeal to a broad audience, but it certainly 
provides an interesting contrast to, say, Channel 8's young and perky combo of 
Stan Miller and Susan Roesgen. 
</P>
<P>
Grimsby is the anthesis of perky. On the set, sans make-up, he looks pale and 
drawn, seemingly on the verge of falling asleep at any moment. He delivers the 
news in a slow, incredibly deliberate style, never moving his eyes or changing 
his expression. He comes across like a grouchy grandfather telling the audience 
what they missed at school that day. 
</P>
<P>
However, close the eyes and listen to his words, and it becomes easier to 
understand why he was the most popular and controversial anchor in New York for 
20 years. A clear product of the golden era of radio, Grimsby has a literate 
style unheard on the local news scene. His feisty personality, his willingness 
to slide his own perspective into the reading of news story, emerges from his 
words, not his mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
Grimsby and the newscast in general haven't been helped by a predictable slew 
of technical glitches. In the two weeks since the newscast came on the air 
without any warning, the program is still extremely entertaining to watch, in 
much the same way it is fun to watch someone learning to ice-skate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to to the usual missed cues, bad camera angles and general 
confusion, there have been some classic television bloopers, from Grimsby 
sneezing into a microphone, producing a sound roughly equivalent to a hand 
grenade exploding in a metal tube, to graphics that look like UFOs hovering 
over the anchors' shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The program's timing is still far off, and the technical problems persist, but 
it is improving. At least Grimsby and Reading are wearing dark suits. That's a 
plus. For the first few nights, they appeared in pale suits in front of a pale 
background, making a very pale impression. 
</P>
<P>
The wardrobe change and a picture of the San Diego skyline at night in the 
background have helped give the program a warmer and friendlier look. 
</P>
<P>
However, in many ways it still has the look of a newscast circa 1972, with 
overly long features, dark and bland photography, and a no-frills attitude. 
With only five reporters, the newscast relies heavily on footage picked up from 
CNN, giving the newscast a preponderance of national features. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the news from old 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' " said one industry 
professional. "I expect to see Ted Baxter on the air, and Murray pounding at 
the typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the bizarre nature of some elements of the newscast, including annoying 
Sports Guy Rod Luck, the newscast clearly is not far from being respectable. 
Something as simple as labeling Grimsby's closing monologue as commentary (last 
week he went off on bankers, "loan lizards," who wouldn't give him a loan) 
would go a long way toward helping people understand the newscast's rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the program is evolving, and hopefully it will never stop evolving," 
Jacobus said. He said he hopes to add more "informational elements," to do a 
newscast that lets people know "it wasn't all death and destruction in the 
world" that day. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 51's biggest virtue undoubtedly will be patience. As long as it is the 
only local 10 p.m. newscast in San Diego, there will be an audience for it. If 
it attracts bigger ratings than its predecessor, reruns of "Newhart," it will 
be easy to justify its expensive existence, given the overall favorable impact 
it can have on the station's identity. 
</P>
<P>
Several local car dealers, angered over a feature that aired on "P.M. 
Magazine," have pulled their advertising from KFMB-TV (Channel 8). 
</P>
<P>
The story, produced in Seattle, focused on car brokers, but touched on unsavory 
practices employed by some car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst case of yellow journalism I've ever seen," said Stephen 
Cushman, owner of the local Cush dealerships, who said he will pull his ads 
from Channel 8 for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The ironic twist: "P.M. Magazine" co-host Pat Brown is Cushman's official 
spokesperson. Brown and "P.M." executive producer Geary Buydos were on 
assignment in Austria when the story aired. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return, Buydos agreed the story was "biased." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the local car dealers have pulled advertising. They 
are organized and vocal, and are more than willing to use their huge ad budgets 
to fight back when they think their image is being tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking for favoritism, just fairness and factual reporting," Cushman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Channel 39 reporter Rory Bennett has landed a new full-time gig. She has 
been hired as a correspondent and producer for "Personalities," the syndicated 
show airing locally on Channel 39, weekdays at 4:30 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A specially-commissioned overnight Arbitron rating survey showed "The Simpsons" 
soundly trouncing "The Cosby Show" in San Diego, posting a 37 share to Cosby's 
22 share. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Starting Oct. 29, Channel 10 will expand its morning news from half-hour to an 
hour, beginning at 6 a.m. . . . Channel 8 reporter Mitch Duncan returns from 
the Persian Gulf this week to co-host a hour-long special, "Operation 
Homefront," scheduled to air at 10 p.m., Tuesday. The special will focus on 
locals involved in military operations, including discussions with families of 
San Diego personnel. . . . KSDO-AM (1130) will air a package of 28 United 
States International University basketball games this fall, featuring guard 
Kevin Bradshaw, the leading returning scorer in the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Call him the human grant machine. KPBS-TV producer Paul Espinosa has received 
an $849,445 grant, the largest single award in the station's history, from the 
National Endowment of the Humanities to produce a feature film of Tomas 
Rivera's novel, " . . . and the earth did not swallow him." . . . KPBS-FM 8.5) 
will celebrate its 30th anniversary with a tree-planting ceremony in Balboa 
Park, hosted by National Public Radio host Scott Simon, at 5:30 p.m. today. . . 
. XHTZ-FM (Z90) has hired Benny Martinez, most recently of KIIS in Los Angeles, 
to hold down the 2-6 p.m. slot.

</P>
<P>
MUSIC: RENAISSANCE MAN OF HIS ART WAS 72. THE LONGTIME LEADER OF THE N.Y. 
PHILHARMONIC CARVED A NICHE IN HISTORY WITH 'WEST SIDE STORY.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, 
composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of 
his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein, known and beloved by the world as "Lenny," died at 6:15 p.m. in the 
presence of his son, Alexander, and physician, Kevin M. Cahill, who said the 
cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure. On Cahill's 
advice, the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire. Cahill said 
progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung 
infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency. 
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood, Mass., on Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony 
orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, 
while conducting from the piano. 
</P>
<P>
He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible "West Side Story" 
and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television 
series "Omnibus." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish 
they possessed in merely one, Bernstein still might have remained an obscure 
musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as 
well as professional life. With it, he became a personality, well known even to 
people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
The dervish persona, including his upstart gymnastics on the podium, never 
lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses. And he 
lifted popular music to a higher plane, infusing performers and listeners with 
his manic joy in creating tonal sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Some conductors mellow with age," commented Times music critic Martin 
Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 
1986. "(But) Bernstein, at 68, remains a frenetic combination of orbiting 
rocket, aerobics master, super-juggler, matinee idol, booming cannon, 
hysterical mime, heart-rending tragedian, bouncing ball, sky writer, riveting 
machine, mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble." 
</P>
<P>
Describing the conductor in the same concert, Bernheimer referred to him as 
"the shrugging, jumping, sighing, soaring, gushing, crouching, rocking, 
rolling, bounding, bobbing, leaping, jiggling, stabbing, hunching, bumping, 
grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis." 
</P>
<P>
Critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized 
showmanship masked lazy, sloppy or inept musicianship, Bernstein could never 
have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades. He 
knew what he was doing, and the musicians he accompanied, wrote for, conducted, 
or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Bernstein (so-named because his maternal grandmother insisted) was born 
Aug. 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Mass., to two Russian Jewish immigrants. His 
father, Samuel Joseph Bernstein, was an entrepreneur of women's hair care 
products and a Talmudic scholar. His mother, Jennie Resnick Bernstein, who 
survives him, said her son always had an ear for music. "When he was 4 or 5, he 
would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill." 
</P>
<P>
The parents preferred the name "Leonard" and called the boy that. When his 
kindergarten teacher asked "Louis Bernstein" to stand up, he remained seated 
and looked around the room to see who shared his last name. Bernstein changed 
his name legally at age 16, when he got his first driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
His mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
When Bernstein was 10, a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his 
parents, and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with 
it. He asked for lessons, and soon was playing better than his teacher, a 
neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
By age 12, he was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and had 
determined, despite his father's objections, that music -- at that point 
playing the piano -- would be his career. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading, remembering 
complicated scores, and improvisation became evident as he played, and altered, 
classical, jazz and popular music. He produced his own shows and versions of 
"The Mikado" and "Carmen," and performed as piano soloist with his school 
orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects 
taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School. 
</P>
<P>
At Harvard University, Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a 
serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron 
Copland. 
</P>
<P>
A fan and practitioner of his music, Bernstein met Copland in a typical 
it-could-only-happen-to-Lenny incident. Invited to a dance recital in New York, 
Bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize. Invited 
afterward to a post-recital birthday party for Copland, Bernstein commandeered 
the piano and played Copland's "Piano Variations." His performance captivated 
the man he had met in the balcony, who of course was Copland. 
</P>
<P>
They became lifelong friends. Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers 
and got him his first job -- transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and 
Hawkes. Ironically, Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make 
conducting, rather than composing or even piano playing, his career. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year -- 1937, his 
sophomore year at Harvard -- when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri 
Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus. Mitropoulos was so impressed 
with Bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the 
Boston Symphony. The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his 
dressing room after concerts, promising to keep in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence of Mitropoulos on my life, on my conducting life is enormous and 
usually greatly underrated or not known at all," Bernstein wrote years later, 
after his mentors had all died, "because ordinarily the two great conductors 
with whom I studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting 
prowess I have, namely Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. . . . But long 
before I met either of them, I had met Dimitri Mitropoulos . . . and watching 
him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the Boston Symphony 
laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which I 
wasn't even aware of until many years later." 
</P>
<P>
Graduated from Harvard and out of work after a summer in New York, Bernstein 
asked Mitropoulos what he should do. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be a conductor," Mitropoulos replied, urging him to study at 
Juilliard or with Reiner at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. It was fall and 
conducting classes at Juilliard were full, so Bernstein went to Philadelphia 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston 
Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer 
home, Tanglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"He became like a surrogate father to me," Bernstein later said of 
Koussevitzky, his third major conducting mentor. "He had no children of his own 
and I had a father whom I loved very much but who was not for this musical 
thing at all. . . . And so I found another father: first Mitropoulos, then 
Reiner, and now Koussevitzky. But the Koussevitzky relationship was very 
special, very warm." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's assistant and returned to Tanglewood 
annually to conduct and teach. He so revered the maestro that he was married in 
Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff 
links. 
</P>
<P>
It was Koussevitzky -- and fate -- who arranged Bernstein's meteoric ascension 
to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys 
that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New 
York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to need an assistant conductor," Rodzinsky told him. "I have gone 
through all the conductors I know of in my mind and I finally asked God whom I 
shall take and God said, 'Take Bernstein,' " he said, granting the position as 
a favor not to God but to Koussevitzky. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an American and so 
young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium. In the 
orchestra's history, no assistant conductor had ever been called on. 
</P>
<P>
But for "Lucky Lenny" history made an exception. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 14, less than three months after Bernstein got the job, guest conductor 
Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm. 
</P>
<P>
Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's "I Hate Music" at her Town Hall debut the 
previous night, in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town, and 
he had played for her and the post-recital party. 
</P>
<P>
With no rehearsal, a hangover and three hours sleep, Bernstein was to conduct a 
complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times chronicled the epic event on Page One and stated in an 
editorial: "Mr. Bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full 
use of his opportunity. . . . It's a good American success story. The warm, 
friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread over the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York 
Philharmonic in 1957-58. He had no time for one. He was too much in demand 
around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Successful as a pianist, composer and conductor, Bernstein, according to Joan 
Peyser in a controversial biography, consulted psychiatrists because of his 
internal conflict over the three pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various 
activities," Bernstein wrote in 1946. "What seems right for me at any given 
moment is what I must do. . . . The ends are music itself . . . and the means 
are my private problem." 
</P>
<P>
The piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime. 
Bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and 
commercializing his conducting career. 
</P>
<P>
His first major composition, a symphony titled "Jeremiah," was introduced in 
1942, and his first ballet, "Fancy Free," and related first musical, "On the 
Town," both debuted in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
He sought to be a classical composer, winning plaudits for symphonies 
("Jeremiah" was followed by "The Age of Anxiety" in 1949 and "Kaddish" in 
1963), sonatas, and the operas "Trouble in Tahiti" in 1953 and "A Quiet Place" 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In writing music, Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway, and even in 
Hollywood, than in Lincoln Center. He followed "On the Town" with the musicals 
"Wonderful Town" in 1953, the score for the film "On the Waterfront" in 1954, 
and the critically acclaimed but less popular "Candide" in 1956. His best and 
best-remembered work, "West Side Story," debuted in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can write one real, moving American opera that any American can 
understand (and one that is, notwithstanding, a serious musical work), I shall 
be a happy man," Bernstein said in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with "West 
Side Story," he disagreed, saying: "There are moments when I think so, but as a 
sum total it fails to be an opera. Because at the denouement, at the dramatic 
unraveling, the music stops. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't love it any less," he added, reveling in the adulation his 
adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet conflict had produced. "It doesn't make it a 
stepchild or a foundling." 
</P>
<P>
In teaching, his fourth area of expertise, Bernstein taught regularly at 
Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton 
Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s, with his "Young People's Concerts" 
of the Philharmonic and "Omnibus," that Bernstein taught the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"An assessment of Bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a 
teacher and popularizer of music, a role that has set him apart most from other 
performers," conductor, historian and Bard College President Leon Botstein 
wrote in Harper's in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Instinctively adept at television, Bernstein became a prototype for Carl Sagan, 
Alistair Cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the Public 
Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's programs, Botstein said, "displayed his gift for analyzing and 
enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score, 
its complexity, or its simple genius. No one before or since Bernstein has been 
so effective -- artistically and commercially -- in proselytizing and bringing 
alive serious music to a mass audience." 
</P>
<P>
The television classics won Bernstein a coveted Peabody award. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that 
had made him wealthy to the struggling New York Philharmonic. He introduced 
free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television, widening its 
audience and tripling paid concert attendance. 
</P>
<P>
He left the orchestra in 1969, after a record 11-year tenure at the helm, to 
have more time for composing and guest conducting. 
</P>
<P>
If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the 
third was anchored in his uproarious personal life. Known for his emotional 
embraces of both sexes, Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with 
him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country 
home. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until 
noon, he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people. 
</P>
<P>
"God knows, I should be dead by now," he said as he approached 70, 
characteristically cavalier about his health. "I smoke. I drink. I stay up all 
night. I'm overcommitted on all fronts. . . . I was told that if I didn't stop 
smoking I'd be dead at 35. Well, I beat the rap." 
</P>
<P>
Raising the high-brow music world's eyebrows, Bernstein campaigned with other 
celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the Vietnam 
War in the 1970s. Criticized for "radical chic," his leftist political 
philosophy prompted him to host a storied fund-raising party for the Black 
Panthers in 1970. In 1989, he rejected a National Medal of the Arts in protest 
of the withdrawn $10,000 grant (later reinstated) of the National Endowment for 
the Arts to an art show on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Although Peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that Bernstein had 
many homosexual affairs (Bernstein promised his children never to read the 
book), there was no question that he adored his family. On Sept. 9, 1951, he 
married Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and, despite a short separation 
and subsequent reconciliation in 1976, remained devoted to her and went into a 
severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein is also survived by two daughters, Jamie and Nina, as well as his 
sister, Shirley, and brother, Burton. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Margaret Carson said the funeral would be private. 
</P>
<P>
Staunchly opposed to retiring, until last Tuesday, Bernstein continued his 
guest conducting, composing, and recording, perhaps topping his more than 200 
records with the best of his best, a re-recording of "West Side Story" in 1985. 
The effort became Deutsche Grammaphon's all-time best-selling record and 
prompted Will Crutchfield to write in the New York Times that Bernstein was in 
a class with Giuseppe Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand saluted "West Side Story" anew in 1986 
when he made Bernstein a commander of the Legion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
After a nationwide series of concerts and parties celebrating his 70th birthday 
in 1988, Bernstein said with uncharacteristic modesty: "I have no further 
requests of the fates . . . except for time. I've achieved more than I had any 
right to expect. Nobody has been as lucky as I have."

WHITE HOUSE FLATLY REJECTS LATEST DEMOCRATIC TAX PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: PRESIDENT, CONGRESS HEAD FOR NEW SHOWDOWN. SUNUNU SAYS ANOTHER 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IS LIKELY. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As President Bush and Congress headed for another showdown over the budget this 
week, Administration officials Sunday flatly rejected a House Democratic 
deficit-reduction plan and declined to throw full support behind a bipartisan 
alternative in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating no quick solution to the impasse, White House Chief of Staff John 
H. Sununu predicted the "odds are relatively high" that the federal government 
will shut down again at midnight Friday, when the government's current spending 
authority expires. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and the House are expected to vote by midweek on differing 
budget packages designed to avert another government shutdown and cut the 
deficit by raising taxes and reducing spending. After that, a House-Senate 
conference committee must try to resolve the enormous differences in the two 
proposals before sending a bill to the President. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the time pressures created by the Friday deadline, Sununu said that the 
President will not unveil his own recommendations for a new budget package 
until both the House and Senate have acted on their proposals and the 
conference committee has convened. 
</P>
<P>
This showdown comes at a time when Bush's popularity ratings have dropped 
dramatically and the economy is suffering from rising prices at the same time 
that it appears to be on the brink of recession. 
</P>
<P>
The task of finding a compromise also will be more difficult because midterm 
elections are only three weeks away and Congress is being asked to approve the 
largest tax increase in history as part of an unprecedented effort to slash the 
deficit by a half-trillion dollars over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to approve a budget plan, however, would further shake confidence in 
the dollar and stall any reduction in interest rates that might result. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," Sununu said that Congress is to blame 
for the crisis because the House two weeks ago rejected a budget agreement 
endorsed by the President and Senate and House leaders of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
"The American public does realize that it is Congress' muddling around and 
trying to avoid a vote right now that's creating a great deal of the 
difficulty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee, charged on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley" that it was the 
President who had set back the budget process last week by "changing his mind 
several times" on what kind of budget pact he would accept. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sununu and Vice President Dan Quayle condemned a proposal backed by the 
House Democratic leadership that would raise taxes sharply on upper-income 
Americans, provide a tax break for middle-income investors and avoid any 
increase in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," complained that the House Democratic 
plan would raise taxes on all Americans, no matter what their income level, 
because it delays for one year the scheduled inflation adjustment of tax 
brackets and personal exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are violently opposed to that Democratic plan," Quayle said. "A family of 
four at $35,000 will pay an additional $270 of taxes a year." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu added: "A bad solution will not improve the economy." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sununu gave only lukewarm support to a $500-billion 
deficit-cutting package approved by the Senate Finance Committee, which has the 
backing of both Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a much better reference point for reconciliation than the House package," 
Sununu said. "But we believe . . . it can be brought even closer to the summit 
agreement and that package would be acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
While Sununu still admires the pact worked out by White House and congressional 
negotiators -- but rejected by the House -- both Democrats and Republicans in 
Congress agree that it must be modified to cushion the impact on Medicare 
beneficiaries and lower the impact of tax increases on middle-income and 
lower-income groups to stand a chance of passage. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the current Senate proposal would limit the amount of deductions 
that taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or more can use to reduce their taxes, 
which would raise $29 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate package, approved 15 to 5 by a combination of nine Democrats and six 
Republicans on the Finance Committee, also includes a 9.5-cent-a-gallon 
increase in the gasoline tax that has attracted nearly universal opposition in 
the House. Instead of raising Medicare beneficiaries' payments by more than $28 
billion over the next five years as the rejected agreement proposed, however, 
it would lower the increase to $18 billion between now and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee also agreed to apply the 1.45% payroll tax for Medicare 
on the first $89,000 of wages or salaries each year, instead of the current 
ceiling of $51,300. The House Democrats would apply the tax to the first 
$100,000 of pay. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders have agreed to defend the Finance Committee plan when debate 
begins, probably on Tuesday. But Bentsen acknowledged that he expects 
"politically appealing" amendments to be offered that would be hard for 
senators to resist. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), for example, has said that he will propose 
a 10% surtax on persons with more than $1 million in taxable income and use the 
additional revenue to cushion further the impact of the budget accord on 
Medicare recipients. A similar so-called "millionaires' surtax" already in the 
House package would raise more than $7 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Republicans are split on whether to offer an alternative package 
or just fight the Democratic plan. Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has said 
that the chances are good for approval of the package put together by House 
Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) that puts the greatest tax 
burden on upper-income groups. Rostenkowski, appearing on CNN's "Newsmaker 
Sunday," said that he would insist on a top tax rate of 33% as part of any 
budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in cement about anything," Rostenkowski said. "There are certain 
things that I think are necessary, and that certainly is the (top) rate of 33%. 
I believe that Americans in the upper-income brackets should shoulder their 
responsibility just like those of us in the lower-income brackets." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current stopgap spending law approved by Congress and signed by the 
President, the government can continue spending until 12:01 a.m. Saturday. 
Unless this spending authority is renewed, all but essential federal services 
would halt and most of the 2 million U.S. government employees would be 
furloughed without pay.

SYRIA MAKES CLEAR WHO'S DOMINANT POWER IN BEIRUT;

<TEXT>
<P>
In the rubbled forecourt of Lebanon's presidential palace at Baabda, Syrian 
troops Sunday heated coffee over a fire fueled with shredded posters of fallen 
Christian strongman Michel Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
The flag of Damascus flew over the Lebanese Defense Ministry in nearby Yarze, 
and for the first time in 12 years, Syrian soldiers patrolled the streets of 
East Beirut, capital of the Christian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
If Syrian President Hafez Assad still harbors the ambition to restore Greater 
Syria, including Lebanon -- and many Damascus-based diplomats are convinced 
that he does -- Saturday's lightning assault that toppled Aoun was a decisive 
step. At the least it erased any doubt that Assad would remain the ringmaster 
in Lebanon, the sorrowful sideshow of power politics in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Assad's government waited for months before delivering the final blow to Aoun, 
who had repeatedly threatened to "break the head" of the Syrian president with 
a crusade of liberation. Syrian propaganda labeled the Christian general a 
lunatic and pointed to the imbalance of forces -- Aoun's 15,000 men to Syria's 
Lebanon army of up to 40,000 -- as evidence of an unwarranted superiority 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats in Damascus, the Syrian hand was apparently 
stayed by American advice for caution and the standing Israeli warning against 
any sudden change in the Lebanese political balance. "Assad's been ready to 
move more than once," one diplomat said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Why now? The Damascus government was not saying precisely, but Sunday's edition 
of the government daily Tishrin described the Syrian military role as an 
example of proper intra-Arab action, a bit of brotherly help for a favored 
leader, in this case Lebanon's pro-Syrian President Elias Hrawi. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a relation which is not based on annexation and wiping out countries 
from the map," Tishrin added in a reference to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and 
subsequent annexation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Several Middle East political analysts said that Assad was emboldened by his 
rising stock in Western capitals, the result of committing an estimated 15,000 
or more troops to the international force in the Saudi Arabian desert. The 
Saudi daily Al Sharq al Aswat pointed out that Syria wanted big power 
acquiescence for any move against Aoun, fearful of a situation where "one of 
the members of the (U.N.) Security Council would urge the council to lay its 
hands on the Lebanese file." 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news agency quoted Uri Lubrani, the coordinator of Israeli operations 
in the southern Lebanon security strip, as saying: "I have no doubt that the 
Syrians felt much freer to use force inside Lebanon when they are in an 
alliance with the United States (in Saudi Arabia)." 
</P>
<P>
So far it appears that Damascus has what it wants. No demands for Security 
Council resolutions condemning Syrian force against Aoun have been raised. 
Syrian troops are encamped in the Baabda palace, on a rise overlooking Beirut's 
southern suburbs. They are kings of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
President Hrawi was elected by a Lebanese Parliament under the protection of 
Syrian guns. Hrawi himself spent the first months of his term in a Syrian 
military camp in the Bekaa Valley. Aoun is powerless, his loyal brigades having 
surrendered to the president's authority. 
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon remains Lebanon, and even the Syrians, at this moment of their 
strongest power there, cannot call all the shots among the country's fractious 
politicians and militia leaders. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the issue was what to do with Aoun. The French government, the 
primary supporter of Lebanon's Maronite Christians, has granted him asylum. A 
helicopter is on hand in the French Embassy compound prepared to fly him here 
to Cyprus, where the Paris government reportedly has a plane standing by to 
take the general and his family to France. 
</P>
<P>
The Hrawi government, however, wants the judicial authorities to review the 
request. Typically, the factional leaders were talking tough. 
</P>
<P>
Nabih Berri, head of the Syrian-supported Shiite Amal militia and a Cabinet 
minister, said: "France must pardon us for not swallowing its hasty decision to 
grant asylum to Aoun. He should stand trial as a plain criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Samir Geagea, warlord of the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia, 
whose men fought a vicious campaign for control of Christian territory against 
Aoun's forces this year, agreed, saying the general "should be brought to 
justice and tried as a criminal." Walid Jumblatt, the Druze chieftain whose 
militia is Syria's strongest ally in Lebanon, suggested that both Christian 
leaders, Aoun and Geagea, be put on trial. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of division and fence-jumping has plagued Lebanon's politics for 
decades. Hrawi says the fall of Aoun will bring unity to Lebanon, but few 
analysts support him. Look at the president's problems: 
</P>
<P>
* The Lebanese economy and currency, performing near miracles of resilience 
through 15 years of civil war, were finally brought down by Aoun's two-year 
crusade to chase the Syrians out of Lebanon and break Geagea's militia. The 
guns of Beirut were silent for only a few months over that time. The refugee 
tide of Christians, Lebanon's entrepreneurial class, ebbed and flowed and 
finally broke into full flood with Christians fighting Christians in the first 
six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
As yet another school term began with classes jeopardized by the fighting, 
families made the decision to cut their roots and seek permanent emigration to 
France, Canada, Australia, the United States and Brazil. The economic 
uncertainty of the Persian Gulf crisis, meanwhile, spread throughout the Middle 
East, hitting particularly hard in a trading nation like Lebanon, and the value 
of the Lebanese pound plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
* The Christian community, estimated at 1 million of the country's 3 million 
citizens and still privileged even under the new political reforms, faces a 
leadership vacuum. By most accounts, nearly one-half were strong supporters of 
Aoun -- and vehemently anti-Syrian. While the general has ordered his soldiers 
to submit to Hrawi's authority to "avoid further cost of blood," the transfer 
of his political following to the pro-Syrian president seems less likely. 
</P>
<P>
And Geagea's Lebanese Forces, who doggedly defended their turf during the 
intra-Christian war, are not likely to surrender the profitable perks of their 
state-within-a-state to Hrawi either. 
</P>
<P>
A top Lebanese Forces official once remarked of Aoun's loud defiance of Syria, 
"We oppose the Syrians too, and we know the time will come when we have to 
fight them. But we are not ready yet. We have to build the Christian heartland 
from within. Aoun has moved too soon." 
</P>
<P>
That sort of talk, which reveals a Christian goal for a cantonal state of 
separate Muslim and Christian communities, is standard fare north of Beirut 
along the Mediterranean coast, the strongholds of Geagea's militia. 
</P>
<P>
* The Lebanese sideshow has not been diminished by the fall of Aoun. The 
Israelis still hold their security strip north of the border, patrolled by a 
Christian militia on the Israeli payroll. It is not in Jerusalem's interests to 
see Syrian power increase in Lebanon, and Aoun's surrender presents Israel with 
new problems. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, self-proclaimed champion of the Islamic cause, was a player in the 
sideshow as an arms supporter to the Christians, both Aoun and Geagea. Analysts 
say that President Saddam Hussein's hand in Lebanon was mainly that of a 
spoiler -- anything to cause pain to his longtime rival Assad. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun is now out of the picture, but there has been no indication that Geagea's 
militia would reject Iraqi support if it could be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
The Muslim militias -- primarily Berri's Amal, the Iranian-supported Hezbollah 
(Party of God), various Palestinian commands and the odd Communist and 
Nasserite groups -- continue to do their military and commercial business in 
general defiance of the central government. 
</P>
<P>
Like every other political group in Lebanon, including the Christians and the 
Druze, Muslim political strength is measured largely by the number of guns in 
the party militia. 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, strengthened by the fall of Aoun, has already heard the familiar charge 
to Lebanese political leadership. Besides righting the economy and rebuilding 
the damage of 15 years of war, said the Syrian ruling party daily Al Baath on 
Sunday, Hrawi must deal with the "most important" of these tasks, "the 
dismantling of the armed militias and ending their existence." Several of the 
militias, it failed to add, are bankrolled by the Syrian government. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hrawi's immediate ambitions, according to press reports from Beirut on 
Sunday, is to move his office from West Beirut into the palace at Baabda, which 
was last occupied by a Lebanese president, Amin Gemayel, in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Syrian soldiers encamped on the palace grounds told reporters that the 
compound will become a military barracks for a while -- a Syrian barracks.

GALAPAGOS IMPERILED BY INFLUX; 
</P>
<P>
THE PRISTINE ISLANDS' UNIQUE FLORA AND FAUNA HAVE DRAWN NATURALISTS SINCE 
DARWIN'S TIME. BUT A GROWING HUMAN PRESENCE THREATENS THE FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT.

GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, Ecuador 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Pacific crashes on the lava rocks at secluded Darwin Bay, a partially 
submerged Ian Noble peers through his face mask amid one of the world's most 
pristine ecological laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Noble's eyes grow wide as a 400-pound sea lion and her offspring dart past his 
legs, burst from the surface and swim directly at him before turning swift 
underwater backflips. Nearby, scores of red-footed boobies nest amid 
Cryptocarpus bushes along the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We might as well get out," says Noble, a schoolteacher from South Norwood, 
England, and a veteran bird-watcher. "It's not going to get any better than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But it may get worse as legions of vacation naturalists follow Noble to this 
fabled archipelago. The Galapagos, made famous by Charles Darwin, who traveled 
here in 1835 as a young scientist, have been long renowned as a naturalist's 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
But fascination with the islands' unique flora and fauna -- which evolved for 
eons insulated from human disruption -- has also planted the seeds of their 
possible demise. 
</P>
<P>
Today, this fragile environment 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador faces a 
surge of new tourism and immigration that threatens to destroy the 
environmental purity of volcanic islands that Darwin once called "a little 
world within itself." 
</P>
<P>
With such natural frontiers dwindling worldwide, there are mounting pressures 
on debt-ridden Ecuador to take short-term economic advantage of the 
archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism, which generates more than $175 million a year, is a potential growth 
industry for Ecuador -- and much of it is tied to the islands. Yet an 
unrestricted influx imperils the very environment that makes it such an 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, authorities here are at a crossroads. The Ecuadorean government is 
drafting a comprehensive new conservation policy that is expected to determine 
the future of additional hotel construction, tour boat operations and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government wants to continue reaping the benefits of tourism over a 
long period of time, it is going to have to bite the bullet and establish some 
extremely strong policies" restricting tourism and immigration, says Craig 
MacFarland, president of the Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Isles, 
which was set up in 1959 to help foster conservation on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the reason people go to the Galapagos is not for rest 
and relaxation, not for sun and sand," MacFarland says. "They go there to see 
the animals and the ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the strains already have begun to show. 
</P>
<P>
* Tourism has exploded, taxing both the Galapagos' ecology and the ability of 
the financially strapped Ecuadorean government to protect it. Proposals to 
build huge luxury resorts loom as a major challenge to environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
* Lured by tourist dollars, immigrants are moving to the islands from the 
Ecuadorean mainland, increasing the pressures on the Galapagos' already scarce 
resources -- from fresh water and sand to seafood. 
</P>
<P>
* The influx has brought alien plants and animals that endanger species that 
are found nowhere else. Scientists worry that newly introduced fire ants, for 
example, could upset the delicate balance of the insect population, which in 
turn serves as the diet of many birds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is ecotourism gone awry," says Mary Lou Higgins, a World Wildlife Fund 
program officer. "There can be great economic advantage of preserving areas 
because of the tourism potential, but you can also kill a place. There is just 
constant growth, and the islands can't take it." 
</P>
<P>
Although visitors, who are supervised by well-trained guides, are largely 
restricted to marked trails, some of the 45 paths are so badly eroded that 
there is talk of closing them. And the growing number of boats and cars has 
taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to play a game when we rowed into town in the dinghy," recalls 
Jacqueline de Roy, who came to Academy Bay on Santa Cruz Island from Belgium 35 
years ago. "We'd count the number of chocolate chip starfish we could see along 
the rocks at low tide. There would be many, many of them. Now, there are none." 
</P>
<P>
More ominously, in the last five years more than 100 new plant species have 
been introduced to the islands, many inadvertently by cargo boats and 
newcomers. These include aggressive species such as leafy green lantana -- 
which overwhelms endemic plants -- and the guava tree, which forms a canopy 
that prevents the sun from nurturing indigenous seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just such a pristine area that no matter what comes in, it will alter 
the native populations," says Daniel Gerzon, a Galapagos naturalist guide who 
has temporarily left the islands to pursue a master's degree in environmental 
management at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many Galapagos conservationists fear that the isles may end up akin to 
Hawaii, where the introduction of alien species and lack of conservation have 
resulted in destruction of much of the islands' lush rain forests and native 
plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants the Galapagos to become a Hawaii," says Lisa Minichiello, 
administrator of the Smithsonian Institution's Galapagos program. "Galapagos is 
one of the last places where it's still possible to try to control the damage, 
and even preserve it to a great degree." 
</P>
<P>
The battle to preserve the Galapagos appeared to have been won in 1959, when an 
international alliance of conservation groups took a giant step in its bid to 
protect this window on the evolutionary past. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the Ecuadorean government designated the 90% of the islands' 3,000 
square miles that was not colonized at the time a national park, and the Darwin 
Foundation was chartered to help protect their natural assets. 
</P>
<P>
But the struggle has proved to be dynamic -- with new conflicts arising even as 
old skirmishes end. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the islands has grown dramatically since organized tourism began in 
1969. About 50,000 outsiders are expected to visit the 13 major islands this 
year, more than twice the number that came here five years ago. The local 
population has increased from 6,119 to about 14,000 in the last eight years and 
is growing at 12% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have opened a second airstrip on the islands and are building a 
third. And some Ecuadoreans are urging the government to permit increased 
urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the budget for the national park was severely sliced in the early 
1980s and is only slowly being restored. The number of park rangers has fallen 
from 75 to 46. There are four patrol boats, but tour guides say that only one 
usually operates. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors travel throughout the islands on touring yachts, converted 
fishing boats or larger vessels, and sleep in their berths at night. But small 
hotels have opened -- particularly in the islands' main settlement, Puerto 
Ayora on Santa Cruz -- which cater primarily to mainland Ecuadoreans. 
</P>
<P>
The former fishing village is typical of the new trend. It is undergoing a 
building boom, with a growing string of souvenir shops, restaurants and discos. 
</P>
<P>
One staple is jewelry made of black coral, itself an endangered species. 
Although residents still lack such basics as 24-hour electricity and a 
hospital, crime and prostitution have also arrived in Puerto Ayora. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, politically well-connected entrepreneurs have sought to build 
luxury resorts, which preservationists say would seriously deplete scarce 
natural resources and could open the developmental floodgates. Most recently, 
Ecuadorean President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos issued a decree suspending efforts 
to build a five-star hotel on the island of San Cristobal until a high 
commission proposes a new tourism policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Conservationists have had a hard but successful time in convincing the 
government" that it should reject these proposals, says Peter Kramer, field 
program director of the World Wildlife Fund International in Gland, 
Switzerland. "Once you build big beach hotels you're getting into the league 
with Hawaii and the Caribbean and the South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's ambassador to the United States, Jaime Moncayo, asserts that 
ecological and scientific concerns, rather than economic incentives, will 
continue to drive the government's policy in the Galapagos. 
</P>
<P>
But he notes that Ecuadoreans are legally permitted to move to wherever they 
wish -- including the islands. "Part of the species of the islands are the 
people who are already there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
No such species were there in 1535, when a sailing ship carrying the Spaniard 
Tomas de Berlanga, then the bishop of Panama, ran into doldrums and was carried 
out to the previously undiscovered islands on its way from Panama to Peru. His 
account of the islands included the first descriptions of the tortoises and 
iguanas -- both of which are found nowhere else -- and noted the birds' unusual 
tameness. 
</P>
<P>
The islands first appeared on a map in 1570 as the Isolas de Galapagos or 
Islands of the Tortoises. From the late 1500s to the early 1700s, they were a 
hideaway for British buccaneers, who stocked up on fresh water and tortoise 
meat. Exploitation increased in the 18th Century as whalers and hunters nearly 
eliminated the fur seals and wiped out some tortoise species. 
</P>
<P>
The Galapagos were officially annexed by Ecuador in 1832 and a small colony 
established on the island of Floreana, which would soon become a penal 
settlement. Darwin arrived three years later on the vessel Beagle, visiting 
four islands for a total of five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Both in time and space," Darwin wrote of the Galapagos, "we seem to be brought 
somewhat near to that great fact -- that mystery of mysteries -- the first 
appearance of new beings on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Darwin's discoveries here stimulated him to ponder the basis for evolution, 
leading to his theory that the fittest of any species survive through a process 
of natural selection. 
</P>
<P>
The Galapagos proved such a fertile field laboratory for Darwin, as well as for 
the generations of scientists to follow, because all plant and animal life 
arrived by wind and current and evolved insulated from human incursion. In 
addition, as a result of the islands' isolation from each other, diverse 
species emerged. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the lack of natural predators led to the animals' 
fearlessness. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the park was established in 1959, however, predators introduced by 
humans were proliferating. A year later, conservation groups established the 
Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz to spearhead preservation and 
educational efforts and supervise scientific endeavors. And, on many fronts, 
progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
An effective breeding program has the giant tortoises multiplying again. 
Abundant colonies of sad-eyed fur seals frolic offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have undertaken successful campaigns to eradicate hundreds of feral 
goats, which were introduced to serve as fresh meat but which also wiped out 
much of the native vegetation on some islands. 
</P>
<P>
Rats, which attack penguin chicks and tortoise eggs and hatchlings, have nearly 
been eliminated on Pinzon Island. Wild dogs no longer threaten land iguana 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the waters surrounding the islands were declared a Marine Resources 
Reserve. And last year, after an outcry by naturalists over the slaughter of 
sharks for their fins, primarily by Asian fishermen, a law was passed 
prohibiting shark and gill-net fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ferocious-looking white-tipped sharks have returned to the southern 
beach of Bartolome Island, where they glide 10 abreast in water so clear and 
shallow they can be seen from the shore. They had been scared away by people 
until swimming was prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Galapagos wildlife is so benign to visitors, said guide Julian 
Echeverria, that "there's more danger of breaking a leg embarking from the 
dinghy than of being attacked by an animal." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, it is the behavior of humans that concerns conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten tourists, if they behave badly, could easily destroy the Galapagos," says 
the Wildlife Fund's Kramer, a former Darwin Foundation president, "whereas, 
80,000 could be fine if they are well-managed." 
</P>
<P>
Examples of such indiscretions abound. Only last August, in a bid to lure 
hammerhead sharks, one visitor threw out a fishing line, snaring a giant 
frigate bird with the hook and entangling another in the line. 
</P>
<P>
Another tourist trampled on sea turtle nests along a secluded sandy beach. 
Others in his group frightened nearby animals by making loud noises and 
motioning with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
A young sea lion on Seymour Island was found with a piece of twine around its 
neck -- a plaything that could become a deadly noose. Even touching a young sea 
lion is taboo: It alters the pup's scent and could prompt its mother to reject 
it, resulting in its starvation. 
</P>
<P>
But for the respectful nature enthusiast, the opportunity to view so many kinds 
of rare animals at such close range in such striking settings remains nothing 
short of remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
"The tourists who come here now," quipped a tour boat purser, "they are all 
little Darwins." 
</P>
<P>
On Hood Island, Ian Noble wanders along the rugged volcanic landscape 
surrounded by creatures he previously had only dreamed of. He had journeyed 
from Africa to the Amazon in search of unusual birds, but now he has entered an 
avian haven unlike any other. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of blue-footed boobies -- which, one writer quipped, prove that God has 
a sense of humor -- whistle and honk in their seriocomic mating dance, 
high-stepping with their bright blue feet as though strutting with flippers. 
Colonies of snow-white masked boobies atop black lava cliffs peer at Noble like 
ornithological Zorros. 
</P>
<P>
Rare waved albatrosses practice their courtship ritual -- stretching their 
necks, opening their long beaks in a V to emit a high-pitched "whoo-oo," then 
ducking down to engage in an intense, clattering round of beak-jousting with 
their training mate. 
</P>
<P>
And, all along the coastline, prehistoric-looking marine iguanas, miniature 
Godzillas, provide a creepy reptilian backdrop to the bird riot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always heard that the Galapagos were a paradise for bird-watchers," Noble 
confides as he steps around boobies, booby nests and booby chicks along the 
rocky trail. "But I never expected anything like this."

JEWS THANK THE FRENCH TOWN THAT SAVED THEM

CHAMBON-SUR-LIGNON, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people of this hardscrabble hill town in the French Massif Central Range 
never thought of themselves as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't think twice when several thousand terrified Jews came here seeking 
shelter during World War II and Nazi Germany's occupation of France. The 
townspeople were mostly Protestant Christians whose ancestors suffered 
centuries of persecution in Roman Catholic France. When the Jews asked for 
refuge, Chambon-sur-Lignon gave it. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the war, the little Huguenot farming village in the Haute Loire 
region of France had protected 5,000 Jews -- one for every man, woman and child 
in the town. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the aging population of this remarkable town was acclaimed for those 
acts of courage and integrity 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional afternoon, they saw for the first time an American documentary 
film, "Weapons of the Spirit," by Los Angeles filmmaker Pierre Sauvage, 
dedicated to the town. And the Israeli ambassador to France, Ovadia Sofer, 
awarded them Yad Vashem medals of "righteousness" for their courage. 
</P>
<P>
On hand for the ceremonies were several dozen of the wartime Jewish refugees 
and the handful of people who saved them who are still living. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors found themselves overcome by affection mixed with a feeling that 
they had never properly acknowledged the people of the town. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no idea of the terrible things that were going on outside Chambon," 
remembered one of the survivors, Jack Lewin of Woodmere, N.Y. "These people 
protected us from the horror. I will never forget what they did." 
</P>
<P>
Lewin, 65, is an American Jew who was born in Germany and found refuge in the 
town for two years before escaping to Switzerland. The ceremonies Sunday marked 
the second time in four years that the retired chef has traveled here to 
personally thank the people of Chambon. 
</P>
<P>
Half a century ago, when German soldiers and French collaborators came to 
Chambon-sur-Lignon hunting Jews, the townspeople refused to cooperate. Several 
villagers, including Daniel Trocme, nephew of the town pastor, paid the price 
of their silence by being sent off to Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother only did what he considered his duty," said Robert Trocme of his 
sibling, who was exterminated in the Nazi death camp at Maidanek, Poland, in 
1944 for sheltering Jewish children. "He was willing to give his life to help 
reconstruct the future." 
</P>
<P>
The bravery of the people of Chambon and of the peasants in the surrounding 
countryside stood in stark contrast to the dismal record in much of the rest of 
France, where more than 75,000 Jews were rounded up and sent to Germany for 
extermination, often with the cooperation of the French people. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's ceremony, the townspeople found themselves a little embarrassed and 
wondering what it was all about. The town's young Protestant pastor, for one, 
is concerned that all the attention will cause the town to lose the humility 
and spirit of righteousness that led to its courageous wartime acts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these ceremonies are very dangerous," he said, standing outside the 
small stone Protestant reform church with the words "Love One Another" painted 
over the door. "We risk breaking the spirit of what we did here. I am afraid we 
will become too proud of ourselves and lose our ability to react to what 
happens in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the pipe-smoking pastor used the occasion of the medal awards 
ceremony to criticize the killing of Palestinian protesters by Israeli police, 
demonstrating the tradition of religious leaders in the town to speak out 
loudly and boldly, no matter who is listening. One of his predecessors in the 
pulpit, pacifist Pastor Andre Trocme, had been credited with leading the 
Chambon-area effort to resist the Germans and protect Jews. Trocme, uncle of 
death camp victim Daniel, was the main character in the 1979 book "Lest 
Innocent Blood be Shed," by American philosopher and historian Phillip Hallie. 
The book was the first to celebrate the courage of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most satisfied with the events here Sunday was independent 
filmmaker Sauvage, who spent seven years interviewing townspeople to make the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvage, 46, was born in Chambon-sur-Lignon in 1944. If it had not been for the 
townspeople who hid his parents, he might not be alive. The doctor who 
delivered him, Roger Forestier, was arrested and killed by the Nazis.

BRIEFING / LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CIVIL REMEDIES: Spurred by their success in forcing criminals to forfeit the 
fruits of their crimes, police and prosecutors are turning increasingly to 
civil law to deter criminal activity. The actions range from evicting drug 
dealers from public housing units to barring gang activities under civil court 
injunctions. Those who violate such injunctions can be cited for contempt of 
court, even though the forbidden activity in itself may not be a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Two principal reasons underlie the trend. Civil actions allow police to avoid 
the constitutional protections that require law enforcers to "jump through too 
many hoops," according to one observer. They also represent a dimension of 
punishment that goes beyond just sending a violator to prison by allowing 
authorities to confiscate the proceeds of crime and attack the systems that 
support lawbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
The tool of forfeiture is placing increased reliance on civil law, with the 
federal government's recent asset seizures running 20 times the rate of four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
BIGGER GUNS: As the bad guys arm themselves with newer, more lethal weapons, an 
increasing number of police departments are replacing their officers' old 
reliable .38-caliber revolvers with semiautomatic 9-millimeter firearms. While 
90% to 95% of police carried revolvers five years ago, a similar percentage is 
expected to pack semiautomatic pistols five years hence, according to the 
Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Some 17 state police organizations 
currently issue semiautomatic handguns to their officers. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage, advocates say, is that the faster-firing, heavier-ammunition 
side arm allows an officer in danger to fell his opponent more quickly, and 
also carries up to 16 rounds as compared to the revolver's standard six. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the trend say it could cost the country more -- in terms of dollars, 
deaths and injuries -- than it will return in the form of greater officer 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COPS: Efforts to reintroduce "cop on the beat" patrols in which 
officers become better known by citizens and help them with a wide range of 
problems are drawing favorable reviews. Not only does it enable police to 
obtain more cooperation from residents, it gives them a better line on 
neighborhood crime. New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, who advanced 
the technique while heading the Houston Police Department, is moving to give 
community policing its biggest field test ever as New York struggles to deter 
escalating violence. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how successful police techniques are, however, they represent only 
the "front end" of the criminal justice system. Meanwhile, the "back end" -- 
the jails and prisons -- have been stretched far beyond capacity. As a result, 
experts predict that intermediate punishment -- such as requiring drunk drivers 
to view traffic victims in morgues or keeping electronic monitors on 
probationers -- increasingly will gain favor with hard-pressed state and local 
governments.

YOUR PROBLEM: In private meetings with police chiefs around the country, 
federal drug czar William J. Bennett has been chiding them for emphasizing the 
role of others, including schools and families, in combating the drug problem.

AMERICAN ALBUM: BATTLE BETWEEN BIRDS, LOGGERS GROWS IN FOREST;

Deep in the northern Florida woods, miles from anywhere, Jane Monaghan stands 
stock-still among the palmetto scrub, listening. "Nuthatches, red-bellies, 
chickadees, pine warblers, cardinals," she says, ticking off the calls she's 
not interested in. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the breeze whispering through the pine trees, comes the familiar 
squeaky chatter she has been waiting for, and Monaghan turns just in time to 
see a pair of dark-winged birds rocket into a silver-dollar-size hole in a 
nearby tree. 
</P>
<P>
"There they are," says Monaghan, 28, a biologist with the U.S. Forest Service. 
"The RCW, the spotted owl of the Southeast. You know, it's always kind of a 
thrill to see them." 
</P>
<P>
RCW is naturalist shorthand for red-cockaded woodpecker, the rarest of American 
woodpeckers, and the bird that has recently become the bane of the timber 
industry in the Southeast, particularly in Florida. Both the woodpeckers and 
the loggers covet the same trees -- mature, long-leaf pine trees at least 60 
years old and 70 feet tall. The timber companies want the trees for high-grade 
board lumber and telephone poles. The birds want them for homes. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, in the 180,000-acre Osceola National Forest, anyway, the birds have 
been winning. Long protected as an endangered species, the woodpeckers have 
recently benefited from new federal guidelines that increase the buffer zone 
around their colonies and severely reduce the acreage open to logging. 
</P>
<P>
The issue -- for both the birds and the loggers -- is survival. "I think it's 
safe to say that if we are going to survive, we'd have to rebuild the mill to 
do something different than we do now," says Ron Lane, a timber buyer for 
Daniels Lumber Co., which employs 60 people in Lake City at the western edge of 
the Osceola. "People say they want more protection for these animals, but when 
they find out the real cost it may be too late." 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan worries that it already may be too late for the woodpeckers. Over the 
past two years she has identified 44 red-cockaded woodpecker clans, each 
containing one breeding pair and up to seven other family members, in the 
Osceola. But her federal mandate is to increase the number of clans to 250, and 
the only way to do that is preserve the old-growth trees in which the birds 
bore their nesting cavities. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the United States, the struggle to save endangered plants and 
animals while balancing the economic costs becomes more acute each day. In the 
Pacific Northwest, it's the spotted owl versus the loggers. In Arizona, a red 
squirrel is threatened by a complex of observatories. In Wyoming, a dam project 
could harm whooping cranes. Just west of Miami, urban sprawl up to the edge of 
the Everglades makes life perilous for a host of rare creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict here over a small, seldom-seen woodpecker is no less critical or 
emotional. In 1987, two Ocala-area home builders were charged with cutting down 
200 nesting trees and then shotgunning two of the birds in order to avoid legal 
obligations to set aside land for the birds near a planned housing development. 
After guilty pleas, the two were fined $300,000. Some $50,000 of that money is 
being used to fund Monaghan's recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
The woodpecker is not well-known, says Monaghan, "and it's not a cute fuzzy 
like the manatee. But if we lose him, it means we're losing the habitat too. It 
means there would be a niche not filled, and who knows what other species may 
be dependent on it? I don't think the timber interests understand." 
</P>
<P>
What the timber interests understand best are their numbers. Last year, sales 
from Florida's three national forests put $8.5 million in federal coffers, a 
fourth of which is shared by local counties for schools and roads. 
</P>
<P>
In the Osceola, the smallest of the state's three national forests, private 
loggers in 1989 cut 17 million board feet of lumber. This year, because of 
restrictions designed to protect the woodpeckers, that figure will dip to 11 
million. By 1992, the estimated total will be no more than 5 million board 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service Timber Purchasers Council, an Atlanta-based group of 120 
private logging companies, has filed suit, charging that the government 
illegally drew the more restrictive guidelines that enlarged the buffer zone 
from 200 feet to three-quarters of a mile, a loss to loggers of 900 acres 
around each colony. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan does not argue that all logging in national forests should be stopped. 
In fact, for the woodpeckers, removal of some trees is even desirable because 
the birds prefer to nest in tall pines with a clear understory. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Francis Marion National Forest 
north of Charleston, S.C., and virtually wiped out what had been the largest 
population of the woodpeckers. That loss, says Monaghan, makes efforts here 
even more critical. "We should be able to stabilize this population in the next 
five years and keep it from declining," she says. "We can't assure its 
survival. But at least we know what to do to help."

Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
The massive buildup of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf entered its final stage 
after more than two months. M-1 tanks from two of the U.S. Army's strongest 
units arrived in Saudi Arabia on ships, and officials predicted these units 
would have all their equipment by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
With this delivery, the United States now has more than 200,000 troops in the 
region, along with 1,000 tanks, nearly 500 combat aircraft and 59 Navy 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
Although original deployment plans are now nearly complete, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney held open the possibility that more troops and weapons could be 
shipped to Saudi Arabia in the future, if the commanders decide that they are 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government's Novosti Press Agency reported that Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein told a visiting Soviet official in Baghdad last week that he might 
remove his troops from Kuwait in return for some Kuwaiti territory along the 
Persian Gulf. But the Iraqi information minister denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism Front: 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials said that two men carrying forged Syrian and Iraqi passports 
are among suspects arrested in connection with the assassination of Egyptian 
Parliament Speaker Rifaat Mahgoub in Cairo last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said the reports linking Iraq to the slaying were meant 
to "cover up popular indignation" against Egypt's support of the U.S.-led 
forces in the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a luncheon speech in Akron, Ohio, last month, George Bush came out breathing 
fire, blaming congressional Democrats for blocking a budget agreement and 
threatening to campaign against them "in every state in the union." 
</P>
<P>
But by dinnertime, at a stop in Chicago, the President was sounding a different 
tune: Warned that some of his charges had angered key Democrats and jeopardized 
prospects for reaching a budget compromise, the President sought to soothe the 
opposition leaders' feelings. If he had caused any confusion, Bush said: "I 
apologize for misspeaking." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it goes these days as both parties -- and both ends of 
Pennsylvania Avenue -- struggle to cope with the problem of divided government. 
Whatever budget agreement is finally hammered out by the two sides, that 
fundamental dilemma -- which has contributed significantly to the current 
fiscal crisis -- will remain. 
</P>
<P>
This split-up of power between the presidency and the Congress -- which has 
become the rule rather than the exception since World War II -- has produced 
what some analysts call the politics of co-incumbency, leaving both parties 
facing what University of Texas political scientist Walter Dean Burnham terms 
"a choice between collision and collusion." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the last decade, the Republican White House and leaders of the 
Democratic Congress -- leery of rocking the ship of state -- have chosen the 
latter course, hammering out a series of compromises that they have touted as a 
demonstration of statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
But critics in and out of government complain that while such bipartisan 
bargains may protect the negotiators' immediate self-interest, they paper over 
the nation's serious problems and obscure substantive differences between the 
parties and among their constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created a political system built around the idea of risk avoidance," 
says Richard Moe, who was a White House aide during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration and now is an adviser to House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.). "Politicians are paralyzed by the fear of the consequences of 
their actions," Moe says. 
</P>
<P>
To a growing number of scholars, the repudiation by the House last week of the 
budget agreement reached between Bush and top Democratic lawmakers at the 4 
1/2-month-long budget summit underscored the weaknesses of co-incumbency 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Co-incumbency and backdoor deals worked fine as long as you didn't have to 
make hard choices of any kind and when you were not threatening pain and 
strain," Burnham says. "But this budget package did just that. People in the 
Northeast were screaming like hell about the tax on heating oil, and people all 
over were screaming like hell at the notion of cutting Medicare." 
</P>
<P>
Cornell University's Benjamin Ginsberg, co-author of "Politics by Other Means," 
on the declining importance of American political parties and elections, views 
the budget blowup as a warning about the dangers of co-incumbency that party 
leaders should take seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a fire bell in the night," Ginsberg says, "an alarm going off to show 
the desperate straits we're in." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that the stunning rebuff given the President and top 
congressional leaders may backfire on the leadership Establishment in both 
parties by giving new confidence to already vocal minorities, such as 
conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, and thereby fueling more 
partisan behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the fact that the House Republican Party by a very substantial 
margin has now declared that it favors actually fighting for its own values 
means that for the foreseeable future, collusion becomes a less viable option," 
says House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who led a rebellion of GOP 
House conservatives against the budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
"The American system works best when people have a feeling that somebody up 
there represents them and their votes make a difference," Gingrich asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, many politicians still argue in favor of such bipartisan bargains. 
Gephardt, who helped draft the rejected accord as a member of the budget summit 
-- and supported it even though, he says, he "detested" it -- contends that 
compromise is a necessary element in politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the conclusion that the failure to do something would cause economic 
and political chaos -- and that would be the worst of two bad alternatives," he 
explains. "When you can't do what you want to do because you can't control the 
government, you have to decide whether you are going to do something you don't 
like or are you going to do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the economic consequences of the budget crisis, its political impact 
is already evident. Here are the implications for some of the major players on 
the national political scene: 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich. Denouncing the accord as likely to "lose jobs, raise taxes and deepen 
the recession," Gingrich established the ordinarily outnumbered House GOP 
conservatives as a political force-to-be-reckoned-with -- and may have signaled 
his own political ambitions as well. "There's not much standing between him and 
the 1996 nomination, except Dan Quayle," Cornell's Ginsberg says. 
</P>
<P>
New York Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. For Cuomo, who is the early favorite 
of Democratic professionals for their party's 1992 nomination, attacking the 
agreement put together by all those Washington insiders gave him an opportunity 
to play the outsider -- one of his favorite roles. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the budget accord as something that "Washington" had "slapped 
together," Cuomo charged that it would have added to the tax burden "of those 
already most burdened -- the workers of the middle class and their dependents." 
As for the art of compromise, so valued by the budget negotiators, Cuomo quoted 
Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said that compromise sometimes amounted to "surrender 
and invited new demands." He called the budget proposal "a surrender to the 
failed policies of the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Bush. For the first time during his presidency, Bush asked the country to 
sacrifice by supporting the tax hikes and the spending cuts in the budget 
proposal -- and the country turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to make it much harder for him to proceed on the pragmatic basis 
he favors," says Richard Williamson, who was an aide to former President Ronald 
Reagan and is now an informal adviser in the Bush White House. "He is going to 
have to come up with a better definition of the driving force behind his 
presidency." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush scarcely helped his standing with the public by 
acknowledging that the dilemma of having a divided government made him prefer 
global wheeling and dealing -- as he has done in managing the Iraqi crisis -- 
to the nitty-gritty of domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
"People really basically want to support the President on foreign affairs," the 
President told a press conference last week. "Whereas on domestic policy, here 
I am with Democratic majorities in the Senate and Democratic majorities in the 
House having to try to persuade them to do what I think is best. And it's 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
If divided government seems complicated to Bush, it's even harder for the 
average citizen to understand. "When people vote, I'm sure they don't think 
they are voting for divided government," Gephardt asserts. "It's our system 
that creates divided government." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the causes are deeply embedded in the system -- a function of the 
constitutional separation of powers designed by James Madison, who gave 
Congress and the President separate functions as a matter of checks and 
balances. "Ambition must be made to counteract ambition," Madison wrote. "The 
interests of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
But the governmental deadlock that has been so marked in recent years also 
seems to reflect the political trends of the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
After voters' disillusionment with Democrats because of the agony of Vietnam 
and the disappointments of the Great Society, they generally have approved the 
Republican approach to economic and foreign policy, which are mainly 
presidential responsibilities. At the same time, they have often favored 
Democrats to oversee the provision of everyday government services. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the situation almost literally fits the epigram offered by 
American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider: "The Democrats can't 
win the presidency, and the Republicans can't win anything else." 
</P>
<P>
But critics assert that this trend is reinforced by the tendency of leaders in 
both parties to strive to protect the status quo rather than risk confronting 
the opposition on controversial issues that might jeopardize their political 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
Take Bush's decision to abandon his "read my lips" opposition to tax increases 
-- a stand that congressional Republicans had counted on to be their best 
defense against Democrats. It is widely assumed that Bush shifted his ground on 
taxes in the belief that accepting a tax increase would be the best way to 
reduce the deficit and thus stave off a recession, which would threaten his 
reelection hopes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House is convinced that if this budget package, more or less as they 
agreed to it, isn't passed, interest rates will remain high," said conservative 
activist Paul M. Weyrich after talking to White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu last week. "If interest rates remain high," Weyrich said Sununu told 
him, "growth will slow and we're into a recession, and if we're into a 
recession they're in very deep trouble politically." 
</P>
<P>
But many conservative Republicans warn that the bipartisan accord is both bad 
policy and bad politics. They believe that tax increases by themselves will 
bring on a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"What Bush should have done was to veto any tax increases and dare the 
Democrats to let (the) Gramm-Rudman (deficit-reduction law) go into effect, 
which would have cut the spending programs they want to protect," says David 
Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, on the other hand, are under fire for being too timid to challenge 
Bush. One example cited by critics is the failure of Democratic congressional 
leaders to push hard for the proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) 
to cut Social Security payroll taxes. Moynihan argues that the surplus in the 
Social Security trust fund is being mischanneled to make the federal deficit 
look smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that inhibits Democrats is their heavy indebtedness to corporate 
political action committees (PACs), whose contributions swell the campaign war 
chests of their congressional incumbents. "Democrats get as much or more PAC 
money as Republicans," says Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), chairman of the 
newly formed Coalition for Democratic Values, which is dedicated to reviving 
the party's liberal activist tradition. "The PACs play the game, and they 
understand who is in control of Congress." 
</P>
<P>
George Shipley, a Texas-based consultant and onetime adviser to 1988 
presidential candidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), agrees. "Our party has 
not been able to take advantage of new issues that emerge, like the 
environment, because we don't want to risk losing all that PAC money," Shipley 
says. "We've grown comfortable with our control of Congress."

<P>
More than 90 gamblers and vacationers, complaining of nausea and breathing 
difficulties, were hospitalized Sunday after being overcome by an apparent 
release of sewer gas inside two hotel-casinos on the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if some sewer gas backed up, affecting the Excalibur and 
Tropicana," said Clark County Health Officer Dr. Otto Ravenholt. 
</P>
<P>
The two hotel-casinos are located across the Strip from each other and have a 
combined total of about 7,000 rooms. The resorts were not evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a sizable response to a relatively mundane problem," said 
Ravenholt. "But the examination of how it came about and how it can be 
precluded will take days or weeks." 
</P>
<P>
A sewer line problem was reported east of the Strip earlier Sunday. "It may be 
related," said Ravenholt.

PROFESSOR TO SPEAK AT SAUDI CONFERENCE

A Ventura College mathematics professor plans to fly to Saudi Arabia on Friday 
to address an international computer conference that is being held despite the 
tensions along the country's eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm betting on things stabilizing, but everything depends on what happens in 
the next week," said Ben Matley, 60, who founded the college's data processing 
department in 1969. "If hostilities break out, I certainly won't be going." 
</P>
<P>
Matley, an expert on the computer's role in economic growth, was asked in June 
to present a 45-minute keynote address at the 12th Saudi National Computer 
Conference in Riyadh, which begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Mandurah, an administrator at King Saud University in Riyadh, wrote in 
his invitation that Matley's 1988 book, "National Computer Policy," has 
generated considerable discussion among Saudi academicians. He asked Matley to 
discuss government computer policies in developing nations in his speech, which 
will be delivered to an audience of predominantly European and Middle Eastern 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District approved Matley's 
request for time off for the trip, on the condition that he not go if the State 
Department later recommended against travel to the area. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has recommended that Americans avoid Saudi Arabia's 
eastern province, where military forces are massed to defend against a possible 
Iraqi invasion. The department has made no recommendation on civilian travel to 
Riyadh, the Saudi capital. 
</P>
<P>
Matley, whose air fare and hotel bills are being paid by the Saudis, said he 
received a facsimile transmission from Mandurah on Saturday night confirming 
that the conference is still scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as safety goes, I'll have 200,000 troops and aircraft carriers to back 
me up," said Matley, who served in the U.S. Navy from 1949 to 1955. "When you 
think about it, there were 12 people murdered in L.A. on a recent weekend when 
there was no one killed in Riyadh. So where would I really be safer?"

WEST ISSUE ARE WATER SURCHARGES A GOOD IDEA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April, the city of Ventura limited single-family houses to a monthly average 
of 296 gallons of water a day and multiple-family residences to 196 gallons. 
Businesses must use 20% less water than last year. Violators will be billed at 
higher rates for extra water. Are these penalties necessary and fair?

 The issue of water conservation should not even be an issue of fine or 
penalty. It should be a responsibility. People should realize that we live in a 
desert, and that we don't know how long this drought will go on -- another 
year, five years, maybe even 15 years longer than it has already. I don't think 
people think this drought is serious enough. Businesses, especially 
agriculture, are really missing the boat by not using partly treated water. It 
seems to me a crying shame, with the air quality such as it is, to allow fruit 
trees to die while we're flushing hundreds of gallons of water a day! Because 
there haven't been any real hardships, people just think like spoiled children. 
They feel we can rely on state water or future dams and yet we're not positive 
that the water will be there. If we looked at other countries, for instance 
certain islands where the water is only on for 12 hours out of 48, or in the 
evening, then we might start treating it as the precious commodity it is.

Certainly the water ordinance does require an element of penalty. But the 
perception on the part of those who are being subjected to these penalties is 
that our leaders, for their own political reasons, don't wish to seek 
immediate, and/or long-term solutions to the water problem. Many people in this 
community believe that the city leaders are utilizing water to fulfill their 
own agendas of no growth. If you don't solve the water problem, then you have a 
very good reason for saying "no" to future growth. I believe that government 
should be elected to solve the problems of the community, and that growth, 
which is the big issue all over California, is a natural phenomenon. There are 
many people who believe that the city management has failed to foresee that our 
local ground-water supplies would eventually not service the community. The 
city paid something like $8 million for rights to connect into state water 
projects. We've been doing this for 15 years and received nothing for it.

<P>
I think AQUA favors a form of water rationing as a short-term solution until 
such time as there are other water resources available. The current plan we do 
not favor. When we formed into small communities and built towns, we gave up 
our water rights. We all stopped drilling, taking our wagons down to the creek. 
Government has assumed this role for years. I think the people of this 
community are trying to conserve. The problem is the city has an obligation to 
find quality water alternatives and they're not doing it. We do not favor 
continuation of this water conservation program past December. I watched with 
horror earlier this summer as my teen-ager came home from college, my mother 
came to stay for two months, my niece and three children, came for six weeks. 
We monitored showers and took other measures. Do I want to do this past 
December? No, I don't, and I don't think I should be required to when 
government is sitting up there and not doing a damn thing to get extra water.

 I don't think anything about the water crisis is really fair. And 
unfortunately, fair isn't as much the issue as conservation. We tried to make 
it fairer by making sure you could average your month-to-month use and be 
rebated if your early total was within the allocation. We have also, in order 
to allow businesses to grow, allowed them more water once they have done 
everything possible to make sure they're using their water 100% efficiently. 
Then they can apply for more water. So fairness is not the issue. As far as 
doing everything we can to ensure adequate supplies, the facts say of course we 
are doing everything we can! In the last few months, we did a search and found 
about 7,000 acre-feet per year and we're bringing it on-line. We're spending 
$13 million on a water system because in the past, the planning wasn't there 
for pumping. I think in the beginning days of the ordinance we heard, "Gee, we 
can't do it." A lot of people are finding that they can do it.

Yes, I think the penalties are probably necessary and fair. I think the City 
Council had to do something. Santa Barbara was panicking. We probably had a 
little more water than they did. I think the City Council spent a lot of time 
in indecision and I'm not sure they've decided yet what to do for the long 
term. So I think some kind of decision like this was forced upon them. Here at 
the mobile home park, we don't have any way of measuring the usage of any 
particular mobile home site, so the manager, in her little newsletter, has been 
commenting on water usage and offering tips to save it. She says we're over 
allocation and we'd better do better. The penalty doesn't affect us 
individually, but I suspect if we continue to be over the allocation, we could 
feel it personally. I think my wife and I are being a great deal more careful 
in conserving. We take shorter showers, and when I'm cooking, I never let the 
water just run. I used to wash my car regularly and now I just turn the hose on 
very low and knock some of the dust off.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;

<P>
CITY TO MEET WITH ANNEXATION FOES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousand Oaks officials plan to meet with a group of landowners who oppose a 
proposed annexation of the Rancho Conejo Industrial Park, City Manager Grant 
Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission last month reversed an 
earlier decision not to allow Thousand Oaks to move ahead with annexing the 
350-acre industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO's action paves the way for the city to annex the industrial park, but 
officials still need to gain approval from a majority of the businesses and 
landowners for annexation to proceed, Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings with the business owners have not yet been scheduled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park is north of the Ventura Freeway and is almost completely 
surrounded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition by more than 50% of the registered voters in the industrial park 
could block the annexation effort, a LAFCO official said. 
</P>
<P>
If 25% to 50% of the property owners protest, the city would have to call a 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
Many landowners contend that the annexation would be bad for business, but they 
have agreed to meet with city officials, said Jim Bilicki, who represents more 
than 50 of the property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners protested the city's attempts earlier this year to annex the 
industrial park, saying that business costs and utility fees could increase if 
the area becomes part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Differences between county and city zoning requirements could require 
businesses to upgrade their buildings to conform to city standards, Bilicki 
said. Trash rates would also increase an estimated 25% if the area were to be 
annexed, he said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

BERNSON WILL BACK MAJORITY IN CARVING NORTH HILLS FROM SEPULVEDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to rename part of Sepulveda as "North Hills" has gained key support 
from City Councilman Hal Bernson, and backers say enthusiasm for the idea is 
growing among residents. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the 4,000 homeowners in the neighborhood west of the San Diego 
Freeway have signed petitions demanding the new name. The effort needs 3,500 
signatures to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ribons, a 27-year-old real estate broker and the spokesman for the 
secession campaign, said part of the campaign's appeal is that the name North 
Hills sounds more prestigious than Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the new name bears little relation to the topography or 
location of the area, which lies south of Lassen Street and is as flat as a 
chessboard except for the sloping mound on which the Veterans Administration 
Hospital stands. "People just think hills are better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the renaming campaign also say that the freeway forms a dividing 
line between what they say is the crime-plagued neighborhood of apartments and 
businesses to the east and the relatively crime-free neighborhood of mostly 
single-family homes to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who has the authority to approve the name change without consulting 
the full Los Angeles City Council, will do so if the majority of the residents 
favor it, said Greig Smith, Bernson's chief deputy. In 1987, Bernson joined 
Councilwoman Joy Picus to approve changing the name of a section of Canoga Park 
to West Hills when residents in the area -- which includes portions of both 
Bernson's and Picus' districts -- joined a secession movement started in the 
section represented by Picus. 
</P>
<P>
"If most of the residents want it, then we're going to give it to them. It's 
not a big deal," Smith said. "All you have to do is stand in the middle of the 
freeway and look to the left and to the right to know that those are two 
totally different communities." 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live on the east side of the freeway have no direct say in the 
matter, because the freeway divides Sepulveda into two council districts. 
Bernson represents the western portion, and Councilman Joel Wachs represents 
the east side. 
</P>
<P>
No organized opposition to the name change has surfaced, but some residents on 
the east have called Wachs' office to express their opposition, said Arline 
DeSanctis, one of Wachs' deputies. She said both council offices should have a 
say in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage people to improve the community rather than leave it," DeSanctis 
said, reflecting the concern of many who live on the east side of Sepulveda 
that those on the west side will abandon community improvement efforts if that 
area is renamed. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Vazquez, president of the newly formed Sepulveda Coordinating Council, 
said the council has not taken a position on the secession movement. But he 
chastised proponents of the secession campaign for failing to participate in 
community efforts to beautify the area and reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that Sepulveda should remain Sepulveda, and we should 
deal with problems and not try to change names and pretend that there are not 
problems here for the less fortunate," Vazquez said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ribons said the name change would stimulate more community involvement, 
including participation in what would be neighboring Sepulveda. He denied that 
raising real estate values is a motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were really running away from the problems, we would just sell our 
houses and leave," Ribons said. "It's just that things have gotten to the point 
where people on the west side of the freeway are so frustrated with the name 
Sepulveda and the connotations of crime and prostitution that they are closing 
themselves in and not getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The name change would give them some instant pride, and then we'd ask them to 
help out in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Ribons, who grew up in Sepulveda, said he has spent about $1,000 of his own 
money to print petitions and mail them to property owners in the area. He said 
organizers decided to conduct a mail campaign, instead of continuing to canvass 
door to door, because it is more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents are not seeking a ZIP code change for the area, partly because of 
the difficulty in getting the U.S. Postal Service to approve it, Ribons said. 
It is commonly believed that ZIP codes are used to determine auto and home 
insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of changing ZIP codes, Ribons said, residents of the newly named 
community would probably use the North Hills name and the Sepulveda ZIP code. 
Residents on the northern and western edges of Sepulveda's boundaries consider 
themselves part of Granada Hills and Northridge, respectively, and often use 
those community names with the Sepulveda ZIP code, Ribons said. 
</P>
<P>
But John Conte, a Postal Service spokesman, said inconsistencies between 
community names and ZIP codes can cause delays in mail delivery.

5 MORE HELD IN RACIAL SHOOT-OUT THAT HURT 4; 
</P>
<P>
TARZANA: BLACK GANG MEMBERS FIRED BACK AFTER MEMBERS OF A WHITE SUPREMACIST 
GROUP OPENED FIRE AT AN ETHNICALLY MIXED PARTY, POLICE SAY.

<P>
Five more people were arrested this weekend in connection with what police 
characterized as a racially motivated shoot-out that injured four people at a 
Tarzana party Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, friends and neighbors of Jeffrey Johnson, 20, the jailed Canoga Park 
man accused of sparking the incident, said Sunday that he is not a racist and 
would not have been involved in what was described as a gunfight between rival 
black and white gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Sunday announced the arrests of Daniel Vejarano, 19, of Panorama 
City, Larry Blas, 23, of Canoga Park and Chris Wilson of Sherman Oaks. All were 
arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Police allege that the three men are 
members, along with Johnson, of a white supremacist group called the Reseda 
Hoodz. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Williams, 21, and Arthur Collins, 24, both of Reseda, also were arrested 
on the same charge in connection with the shoot-out, police said. Police said 
Williams and Collins are members of a black gang that also was at the party and 
allegedly returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Johnson and a dozen other gang members went to a party in 
the 4700 block of Hermano Drive attended by a racially mixed crowd of about 
200. Before the party started, police said, Johnson and the others hid a 
shotgun in the bushes. As the party progressed, police said, white gang members 
drank alcohol and directed racial slurs at other party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
After arguing with others at the party, Johnson picked up the shot-gun and 
fired one to three shots in the air, reportedly shouting "white power," police 
said. As the crowd scattered into the street, Johnson leveled the shotgun at a 
party-goer and fired again but missed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Johnson and another member of the white gang ran from the back yard 
and down the street toward a car in which they planned to flee. As they did, 
Johnson turned and fired another shot into the crowd, police said. At the same 
time, a member of a black gang allegedly returned fire with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Hit in the cross-fire were Wilson and three other people, who police refused to 
identify because they were innocent bystanders. All the wounded were in stable 
condition Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Johnson admitted being a member of the white supremacist gang. But 
his 18-year-old girlfriend, Michelle, defended Johnson in an interview Sunday. 
Michelle, who declined to give her last name, said Johnson, the father of her 
infant child, is "not this creature they've made him out to be." 
</P>
<P>
The girlfriend said Johnson, an air-conditioning technician, went to the party 
with several friends and that he talked briefly with members of a white 
supremacist gang, but she denied that her boyfriend was a member. She said he 
was drinking beer with other residents about 11 p.m., nearly an hour before the 
shooting erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff has no racial problems with anybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Johnson's Canoga Park apartment complex -- home to whites, blacks, 
Latinos and Asians -- also expressed disbelief that the man was involved in a 
racist gang or had anything to do with the gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the last person I figure would do something like that," neighbor Mike 
Wong said. "Jeff is not one of those types."

The public debate over plans to locate garbage dumps in four rustic canyons 
ringing the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys promises to heat up this 
week at a hearing on a report that declared the canyons to be environmentally 
sound sites for landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-dump activists from both valleys, forming a united front, were circulating 
petitions against the landfills this weekend. And the city of Santa Clarita, in 
an unusual move, is offering to bus residents to the hearing in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The city ran newspaper advertisements Sunday calling on residents to attend the 
hearing: "You don't have to be the valley of the dumps, but we need your help!" 
</P>
<P>
Opponents plan to challenge the conclusions of the environmental impact report 
that assesses the benefits and problems of operating landfills in the four 
canyons -- Towsley, Elsmere, Blind and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the John F. Kennedy High School 
auditorium, 11254 Gothic Ave. Another hearing will be held Wednesday, also at 7 
p.m., at the headquarters of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, 1955 
Workman Mill Road in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials will accept testimony on the environmental impact report, 
which concludes that the four canyons could be filled with trash without 
endangering ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Two other hearings on the report were held last week in Torrance and Monterey 
Park, cities not located near the proposed landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Most other problems associated with landfills -- dust, noise, odor and traffic 
-- could be curbed or eliminated by new technologies and careful operation of 
the dumps, said the report, which was sponsored by the Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Edwards, secretary of the North Valley Coalition, said Sunday that her 
group will challenge most of the report's conclusions and stress the need for 
alternatives to urban landfills, such as increased recycling and hauling trash 
to remote desert locations by train. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups planning to testify against the dumps include the Santa Clarita 
Valley Canyons Preservation Committee, Save Our Sylmar, and Mothers and Others 
Against Dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Working with 21 schools in the Saugus, Newhall and Sulphur Springs elementary 
school districts, Santa Clarita sent 17,000 flyers home with school children 
last Thursday and Friday, urging their parents to attend Tuesday's hearing, 
said Gail Foy, city spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
People who wish to ride city-chartered buses to the hearing should contact City 
Hall, Foy said. The Santa Clarita City Council has repeatedly said the dumps in 
Towsley and Elsmere canyons could pollute local water tables, from which the 
city draws more than 50% of its water. 
</P>
<P>
Blind Canyon is in the Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth. Mission, Rustic 
and Sullivan are a series of canyons west of the San Diego Freeway and below 
Mulholland Drive.

MARKETS: THE DOW'S SLIDE COULD TAKE IT AS LOW AS 1,700, SOME SAY, AS THE 'DEBT 
BOMB' GOES OFF AND THE RECESSION GETS WORSE THAN MANY HAVE EXPECTED.

To most investors, the stock market's frightening slump is a bleak period that 
can't end soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
But to the market's hard-core bears, this finally is their day in the sun. And 
they believe the worst news is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Eliades, editor of the Los Angeles-based Stockmarket Cycles newsletter, 
sees a drop to "at least" 1,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average before it's 
over. Many of his bear peers are reluctant to name a specific bottom, but most 
agree that it's below 1,700 on the Dow -- a further drop of at least 30% from 
Friday's close of 2,398.02. 
</P>
<P>
Charles LaLoggia, editor of Special Situation Report newsletter in Rochester, 
N.Y., explains his bearishness this way: The United States has entered "a Star 
Trek recession," he says. "We are going where no economy has gone before." 
</P>
<P>
Eliades and LaLoggia are among a handful of market advisers who have been 
harping on stocks' vulnerability since late 1989 or early this year. Most were 
very bullish through the 1980s; they aren't the survivalist types who have been 
proclaiming the end of the world for 30 years. But something changed their 
minds over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the Dow off 20% from its peak, the bears feel vindicated at last. 
Call them the princes of financial darkness, the new nattering nabobs of 
negativism, the horsemen of Wall Street's apocalypse. Just don't call them 
lucky, because nothing makes them more angry than the suggestion that, except 
for Saddam Hussein, there would be no bear market. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a crock of baloney," says LaLoggia. The market may not have gone down 
this fast, he says, but the collapse would have come, and sooner rather than 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the bears, LaLoggia's grim outlook is rooted largely in the 
deepening crisis in the nation's financial system. Too much debt was piled on 
in the 1980s, he says. Too many marginal loans were made, and too many 
companies and individuals -- not to mention Uncle Sam -- have been living 
beyond their means. We're simply overdue for a shakeout, he says, and that 
means many more bankruptcies and defaults, ending in a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast crisis may have lit the fire, but the kindling has been building up 
for years, LaLoggia says. "Saddam Hussein didn't create the loan problems that 
Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover have. He didn't put Travelers Corp. into 
commercial real estate." 
</P>
<P>
What is difficult for many investors to understand, though, is why the bears 
should be right about the "debt bomb" now. As far back as the late 1970s, 
analysts were warning that excessive debt would cause an economic crunch. Yet 
the banking system sailed through the Third World debt crisis of the early 
1980s relatively unscathed. And the recessions of 1980 and 1981-82, although 
harsh, were sparked by a cyclical drop in demand for goods and services rather 
than by a severe deterioration of the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a hell of a lot of gloom and doom talk about the debt problem 
for 15 or 20 years," Eliades admits. There's no simple explanation for why the 
debt load finally became too much, the bears say. All they know is that, in 
Eliades' words, "The contraction of credit has actually begun. . . . The ball 
of yarn is becoming unraveled." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is in the financial problems of major banks, many of which have 
been forced to slash their dividend payouts to shareholders -- an unprecedented 
move -- as wave after wave of borrowers have defaulted on loans. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a coincidence that the bank and S&amp;L stocks began plunging a year 
ago, Eliades and LaLoggia say. Now, the rest of the market is simply beginning 
to telegraph the tough times coming in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letter in La Jolla and a bear since 
January, looks at the destruction of Hilton Hotels and Marriott Corp. shares -- 
both off more than 75% from their 1989 highs -- and sees a clear message that 
"people aren't going to be renting expensive hotel rooms" next year. Since most 
hotel rooms are booked by business travelers, the implication is that business 
will get much worse for many companies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the basic premise for the bears' prediction of a much steeper slide in 
stock prices is that the recession will be far worse than most experts now 
believe. A mild recession still is the expectation of most economists. 
LaLoggia, noting that the vast majority of economists couldn't see the current 
debt crisis coming, asks why anyone should believe that those experts could be 
right about a mild recession. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying it'll be a shallow recession for precisely the same reasons 
that they missed it in the first place," LaLoggia says, which is: They're 
refusing to believe that the financial shakeout from the '80s will bite deeply. 
</P>
<P>
But how do the bears add it all up and get a low for the Dow of 1,700 or less? 
They admit there's no scientific way to pick a bottom in a bear market. It's 
gut feeling -- and some help from history. 
</P>
<P>
In the last truly destructive bear market -- in 1973-74 -- the stock market 
lost 45% of its value from peak to trough, as measured by the Dow. The eeriest 
similarity between then and now is that an oil shock helped precipitate both 
bear markets. 
</P>
<P>
There are other similarities as well. For one, the values ascribed to 
companies' assets had become outrageously overblown, as evidenced by stocks 
selling for 40 or 50 times earnings per share in 1973. This time, though stock 
prices aren't nearly as overblown versus earnings, the assets purchased with 
all that borrowing in the 1980s -- remember takeover mania? -- clearly weren't 
worth the prices paid. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, the stock market faced the same strong sentiment then 
that it faces now: a sense of disbelief that a killer bear market could 
actually happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's looking for a rally now" because the market has plunged so 
sharply, says Dan Sullivan, who writes the Chartist newsletter from Seal Beach. 
Yet, in the slide of 1973-74, he says, there were four occasions when his 
indicators suggested that the bear market should have bottomed, because stocks 
were "completely sold out." Instead, the market continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
If the Dow loses 45% from its peak this time, it will bottom at 1,650. A drop 
to 1,000, as Eliades predicts, would be a loss of 66%. 
</P>
<P>
To many investors, that would seem to herald the end of civilization. But most 
bears aren't planning for Armageddon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cleansing," Eliades says of the bear market, "not the end of the 
world." And as stocks fall, "the people who are out of debt are going to find 
great opportunities over the next two to three years" to buy into the market 
and catch the next bull wave. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll survive this," Russell agrees. But as a nation and an economy, he says, 
"we may survive looking a lot different from what we look like now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW THE BEAR ATE WALL ST. IN 1973-'74 
</P>
<P>
Investors who weren't around for the 1973-'74 bear market don't know how bad 
things got -- and how long the bear market continued. From a peak of 1,051.70 
on Jan. 11, 1973, the Dow Jones industrial index plunged 45% to a trough of 
577.60 on Dec. 6, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jan. 11, 1973: Bull market peak, 1,051.70 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 21, 1973: First oil shock. Arabs cut sales to U.S. for supporting Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Late March, 1974: Market rallies despite recession concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Late June, 1974: Market begins to plunge onr ealization a severe recession is 
under way; Washington paralyzed by Watergate crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 6, 1974: Dow bottoms at 577.60 as recession nears end.

RECORD COMPANIES ON OFFBEAT TRACK IN PROMOTING DISCS 
</P>

Lionel Ridenour and Jeff House promote music for Capitol Records. But unlike 
their independent counterparts, who came under scrutiny last month in the 
payola trial of record promoter Joseph Isgro, the pair don't spend time 
schmoozing at commercial radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Ridenour and House frequent local hot spots and mom-and-pop record 
stores, handing out music to neighborhood "taste makers" who can help advertise 
a new song when they cruise down the street blasting their boom boxes or car 
stereos. Since they were hired a year ago, they have helped boost album sales 
for several Capitol acts, including rap artist Mellow Man Ace and singer Tracie 
Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that rap has taught us is that you don't have to have radio to 
sell a million records anymore," said the two men's boss, Step Johnson, who 
heads Capitol Records' black music division. "Promoting records has changed." 
</P>
<P>
With an explosion in the number of new records creating a music bottleneck at 
radio stations, and with the lyrics of some groups -- such as rap groups 2 Live 
Crew and Geto Boys -- so sexually explicit that no station will air them, the 
record industry is looking at other outlets to promote music. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, 3,300 people attended a Los Angeles conference aimed at 
exploring ways to market heavy metal music, which has been virtually shut out 
of Top 40 radio. Bob Chiappardi, president of Concrete Marketing Inc., the New 
York-based firm that organized the event, told the conference: "It's no secret 
that in the (heavy) metal arena, strong word of mouth is the greatest tool in 
breaking a new band." 
</P>
<P>
To generate that buzz, record companies have set up promotion teams similar to 
Capitol's and hired firms to encourage retailers to play albums and music 
videos in their stores. Labels are also marketing albums over the telephone or 
paying companies to plaster neighborhoods with promotional posters -- a 
controversial practice known as "sniping" that has upset some city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The new tactics are increasing the already sky-high costs of marketing music. 
But they are giving record companies more insight into which media are most 
effective in promoting music. That could reduce the influence of record 
promoters like Isgro, who returned to his business last month after a federal 
judge ended his payola trial and dismissed all charges against him. Federal 
prosecutors have appealed the decision. Meanwhile, Isgro may find that more 
consumers are discovering music through avenues other than radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I learn about a lot of music through friends or just riding around," said 
Orlando Murray, who was flagged down by the Capitol promotion team as he and 
Eduardo Gonzalez III tooled around Los Angeles in a Nissan pickup truck with a 
stack of 60 music cassettes. "If I hear somebody in another car playing a new 
jam, I'll stop them and ask what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Through such word of mouth, heavy metal bands such as Metallica and Anthrax, as 
well as rap groups such as N.W.A. and Public Enemy, are selling millions of 
albums with little or no radio airplay. In one sign of the times, Walt Disney 
Co.'s fledgling Hollywood Records says it won't seek commercial radio play for 
upcoming albums by comedienne Roseanne Barr and the band World War III but will 
market the artists through touring and alternative means. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a sort of vicious cycle in which radio stations wouldn't play 
a record unless it showed sales activity, and you couldn't generate sales 
activity until the record got radio exposure," explained Lenny Leon, marketing 
manager at Concrete Marketing. Now musicians can gain exposure through other 
means. His firm offers one way: a one-hour reel of rock music videos 
distributed to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide Entertainment Marketing, a New York firm backed by Bertelsmann Music 
Group, promotes records over a 900-prefix telephone line called Hot Disc. The 
service allows callers to hear new records and order them through J&amp;R Music 
World in New York. A&amp;M Records recently placed ads in trade publications 
offering singer Wendy Maharry's new compact disc for free to those who dialed a 
toll-free number. 
</P>
<P>
Such techniques contrast with record promotion practices of as recently as a 
decade ago, when radio was virtually the sole focus of the labels. During the 
1980s, record companies paid $50 million to $60 million annually to about a 
dozen independent record promoters to get music aired on radio stations. 
Artists who didn't get airplay didn't sell many records in those days. 
</P>
<P>
That began to change with the growing clout of dance club disc jockeys and, 
later, with the emergence of cable television's 24-hour music channel, MTV. 
</P>
<P>
The first big break for pop star Madonna, for instance, came in dance clubs 
after she met former New York City club disc jockey John (Jellybean) Benitez. 
He helped produce Madonna's 1983 debut album and relied on a nationwide network 
of club deejays to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
"We made Madonna," boasted Dannie (Fut) James, co-owner of Impact Records, a 
Los Angeles company that supplies 100 disc jockeys with records in exchange for 
a $75 monthly fee from each. "And there are a lot of other new artists we have 
broken," such as singer Taylor Dayne, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, record companies have not abandoned radio, which along with MTV is 
still considered the top promotional outlet. But an avalanche of songs from new 
record labels has made it difficult for radio and MTV to absorb the new music. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, record executives have launched a dozen well-financed labels. The 
number of new records has more than doubled since 1986, when the Recording 
Industry Assn. of America estimated that about 2,400 new albums were released. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in a business where a gold record (500,000 unit sales) is a mark of 
success, some record companies find that it pays to focus on relatively small 
groups of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is "to target the music to the right customer," said Capitol's 
Ridenour. He looks for youthful drivers with powerful car stereos. Such 
drivers, he said, "will crank up the music. It's like free advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Still, marketing records outside radio is not cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Initial costs -- including advertising, music videos and specialized 
street-level promotional activities -- range from $100,000 to $300,000 to gain 
enough visibility to get radio attention, said Tom McIntyre, chief financial 
officer for Bertelsmann Music Group, which owns RCA Records and Arista Records. 
A group must sell 100,000 albums or more to offset those costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its popularity, alternative promotion can sometimes go awry. 
</P>
<P>
After South Central Los Angeles was plastered with posters promoting N.W.A's 
new "100 Miles and Runnin' " album with the tag line "Tha Niggaz R Back," some 
of the most immediate response came not from fans but from alleged white 
supremacists who were unable to decipher the posters' origins and ended up 
directing their ire at the wrong person. 
</P>
<P>
Jonni Tegarden, president of a Los Angeles firm called Ruthless Management, 
said angry callers have rung her phone off the hook, spouting racial epithets 
and wrongly identifying her company as the Ruthless Records production firm 
listed on the poster. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of posters advertising all sorts of events prompted city 
officials last year to allot $1 million to increase enforcement of a law 
prohibiting the posting of handbills on private property.

POWER POLITICS IN JAPAN;

<P>
ENERGY: THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO REDUCE OIL CONSUMPTION, BUT ONLY HIGH PRICES 
DETER CONSUMERS. DESPITE OPPOSITION, NUCLEAR IS MITI'S PREFERENCE.

<P>
Enlightened bureaucrats at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
set worthy national goals and then marshal the country's resources to reach the 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
If you think that is how Japan Inc. works, you might want to take a look at the 
nation's energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
As the standoff in Iraq pushes oil prices higher, MITI bureaucrats are getting 
credit for turning Japan into the economy car of the industrialized world -- a 
nation that gets more mileage out of every gallon of oil it uses than just 
about any other country. 
</P>
<P>
But it is far from clear how much credit MITI should get for Japan's successes 
in reducing its dependence on oil, all of which must be imported. Nor is it 
evident that MITI has chosen a wise course for the nation's energy future. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Most energy experts here attribute Japan's energy savings effort to sharp 
increases in the price of oil in the 1970s -- not MITI policies -- and those 
savings still leave Japan heavily dependent on oil. 
</P>
<P>
* MITI's leadership in developing renewable energy sources such as solar power, 
although commendable, has produced few results. And electric utility 
monopolies, backed by MITI, may actually be hindering the development of new 
energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
* The heart of MITI's energy policy is a sharp increase in the use of nuclear 
power, but anti-nuclear sentiment will make attaining that goal costly, if not 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, an advisory committee to MITI scaled back ambitious targets 
for nuclear power. For the first time, the government admitted that 
anti-nuclear activists had made it difficult to find new sites for power 
plants. The advisory group nevertheless recommended that Japan add 40 new 
nuclear power plants in the next 20 years, effectively doubling its nuclear 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers and energy analysts say MITI will be lucky if it succeeds in 
building half that number. MITI's goal of bringing down Japan's dependence on 
oil from 57% of total energy use to 46%, they say, is a pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is always going to be heavily dependent on oil," says Naoshi Kojima, 
analyst at the Institute for Middle Eastern Economies. "With the opposition to 
nuclear power, there is a strict limit to how many new plants they can build." 
</P>
<P>
Japan has no energy resources to speak of, so the search for a steady source of 
energy has always been a national priority. It was one of the major reasons 
Japan gave for entering World War II and sweeping into Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Energy concerns came to the fore again after 1973, when skyrocketing oil prices 
set off panic buying and threw Japan's economy into an inflationary spiral. 
Without military power to assure supplies, Japan set out to drastically reduce 
its dependence on oil. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Iraq invaded Kuwait this summer, the country was in better shape to 
meet the crisis. That was largely because Japan had four months of fuel in 
storage and because heavy energy users such as aluminum producers had gone out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Japan's dependence on oil for energy had fallen to 56% in 1987 from 
about 75% in the early 1970s. Still, the United States, using coal and other 
resources, lowered its oil dependence in the same period to 41%, and some major 
European industrial nations also are less dependent on oil than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, government regulations to encourage energy conservation did help. For 
example, MITI allowed industry to shorten the depreciation time for investments 
made in equipment that helped reduce energy use. MITI also established the 
"Moonlight Project," investing about $85 million a year to encourage companies 
to work together on technology that would promote energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
One such project involves developing giant batteries that utilities can use to 
store electricity generated when energy demand is low, such as around midnight. 
The energy can then be released during peak periods -- for instance, hot summer 
evenings when air conditioners get heavy use. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the sudden increases in oil prices in 1973 and 1979 that really 
forced Japanese companies to invest in conservation, says Hiroshi Tsushima, 
economist at the Long Term Credit Bank's Institute of Research and Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
High oil prices had the same effect on U.S. industry. Although Japanese 
industry cut its energy use per dollar of production by 46% between 1973 and 
1986, U.S. industry showed an almost equally impressive 40% cut, according to 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
</P>
<P>
If Japan comes out looking like a more efficient economy, it's in large part 
because of lower energy consumption by its consumers. Because the Japanese live 
in smaller homes and pay more than three times what U.S. consumers pay for oil, 
electricity and gas, it is not surprising that they use about a third as much 
energy per household as Americans. 
</P>
<P>
When low energy prices allowed Japan to lower rates modestly in the late 1980s, 
the result was a spurt in energy demand driven by larger refrigerators, larger 
cars and bigger homes. And in those cheap oil years, no amount of MITI 
jawboning could get industry to spend money on energy conservation measures, 
Tsushima says. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, the Japanese government prefers to use economic incentives 
to change energy consumption patterns. Half of the $4.50-per-gallon that 
consumers pay for gasoline today, for example, goes for a tax that is used to 
subsidize alternative energy. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this money goes to such fine-sounding undertakings as the MITI Sunshine 
Project, which finances research in solar and other new forms of energy. But 
that research into alternative energy has had only mixed results. Although 
solar cells are found on watches and calculators everywhere, they remain far 
too costly to generate energy for use in homes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as oil prices fell in the late 1980s, enthusiasm for renewable energy 
sources flagged. The Sunshine Project's budget next year will be 185 million 
yen, down from a high of 325 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Persian Gulf crisis leads to substantially higher oil prices over 
the long term, few see renewed enthusiasm for such projects. 
</P>
<P>
In June, MITI substantially lowered its prediction of the potential for 
alternative energy sources, estimating that they would provide, at most, 2.7% 
of the nation's energy needs in the year 2000, not the 4.5% originally 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
The only government effort in alternative energy that hasn't felt the budget 
squeeze is nuclear power. In 1988, Japan's nine utilities spent $4.9 billion on 
construction of new nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
MITI has allocated virtually all the tax money set aside for alternative energy 
development to nuclear power. This year the government spent $2.9 billion to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear is our focus for generating electricity," says Moritoshi Kato, manager 
of general planning at Tokyo Electric Power Co., the world's largest private 
utility, with $30 billion in revenue. "It is the most stable and reliable 
source of energy." 
</P>
<P>
But there are a lot of problems with the nation's nuclear strategy -- public 
opposition, for one. 
</P>
<P>
With so many people, so many earthquakes and no safe place to store nuclear 
waste, "Japan isn't suited to nuclear power," argues Junzaburo Takagi, a 
nuclear chemist. 
</P>
<P>
Takagi was a lonely voice in Tokyo 17 years ago when he started the Citizens 
Nuclear Information Center. Now, the latest poll taken by Asahi Shimbun, a 
major Japanese daily, found that 49% of the respondents were against nuclear 
power, compared to 29% in favor. 
</P>
<P>
Activists are taking advantage of the anti-nuclear sentiment to mobilize 
localities to bar utilities from establishing new sites for nuclear power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
In large part because of this activity, the industry now says its lead time for 
building a new atomic power plant is 27 years, up from 16 years in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-nuclear sentiment has been hardened by a growing number of incidents, 
including one at a Tokyo Electric nuclear power plant a few hundred miles north 
of Tokyo that raised questions about the utility's management. 
</P>
<P>
A few days into the new year, alarm bells had gone off, signaling a 
malfunctioning recycling pump. Supervisors at the plant, evidently hoping to 
save the company some money, kept the plant operating, believing that repairs 
could be delayed for a week, at which time a regular inspection was due. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the inspection was scheduled, however, the vibrations got so bad 
that the utility was forced to close down the plant. Although no radiation 
escaped, the plant was so badly damaged that it has been shut since. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also note that Japanese nuclear plants lack emergency evacuation plans, 
because it would be impossible to move Japan's millions quickly in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the nuclear industry's reliance on a limited overseas uranium supply 
undercuts the argument that nuclear power offers energy independence. "It is 
the same situation as in oil," admits Kazuhisa Mori, executive director of the 
Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. "There isn't much remaining supply." 
</P>
<P>
Japan's costly solution to the problem is to build a reprocessing plant capable 
of removing the plutonium from spent fuel and then build a breeder reactor, a 
next-generation nuclear plant that would create new fuel from small amounts of 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
Both projects, which have already cost taxpayers several billion dollars, are 
being delayed by popular concern over safety risks and by questionable 
economics, according to U.S. nuclear scientists familiar with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the nettlesome question of nuclear waste. Large amounts of 
rainfall and geologically unstable grounds make the nation unsuited for 
long-term storage, said one nuclear scientist with the U.S. Department of 
Energy. "They may have to make a deal to store the waste in the U.S. or Chinese 
deserts," the scientist said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Japan's nuclear policy would like to see Japan use more liquid 
nitrogen gas and speed up the development of renewable energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
But the total monopoly now granted to Japan's nine electric utilities creates 
little incentive for change, they say. 
</P>
<P>
With the government responsible for handling nuclear waste, the utilities need 
not calculate the real cost of the power, according to the critics. And 
utilities lose sales if they encourage consumers to use solar panels or save 
energy.

Former Thrift Chairman Pleads Innocent: Oliver A. Trigg Jr., the former 
chairman of Family Federal Savings Bank, one of the nation's largest 
black-owned thrifts, pleaded innocent to charges that he masterminded an 
elaborate scheme to buy Family with its own money. 
</P>
<P>
Trigg and two associates, James E. Williams and William A. Powell, denied any 
wrongdoing in Trigg's purchase of a controlling interest in the thrift for 
$1.24 million in 1987. Prosecutors said the scheme was carried out through a 
series of real estate transactions. Trial is scheduled for Nov. 20. If 
convicted on all counts, Trigg faces up to 94 years in prison and a $1-million 
fine. (Case No. 90-698. Pleas Entered Oct. 8).

Taiwan Expects to Join Top 10 Traders: The country expects to be among the 10 
largest trading nations by 1996, when its foreign trade should hit nearly $200 
billion, the Board of Foreign Trade said. Last year, Taiwan, with about 20 
million people, ranked 13th in trade, with $66.2 billion in exports and $52.3 
billion in imports. Between 1991 and 1996, its exports are expected to grow an 
average of 7.69% a year, with imports averaging 9.03% growth, said Lee 
Chang-lu, board deputy director.

MGM/UA, Pathe Sued Over 007 Films: Danjaq S.A. sued MGM/UA Communications Co. 
and Pathe Communications Corp. for allegedly violating a distribution contract 
involving 17 James Bond films on which Danjaq owns the copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
In the federal lawsuit, the Swiss company says it anticipates Pathe will be 
unable to make adequate payments on MGM stock when the two companies are 
expected to complete their merger this month. The suit charges that MGM "has 
failed to supervise Pathe" in efforts to raise funds by distributing Bond 
pictures on foreign markets, which, Danjaq says, violates a 1962 distribution 
contract between itself and MGM. (Case No. 90-5498. Filed Oct. 11, 1990).

THRIFT FAILED AFTER A LOAN TO BUSH'S SON JEB 
</P>

A savings and loan became insolvent after lending President Bush's son Jeb and 
a partner about half the money toward purchase of a $9-million office building, 
and the federal government ended up repaying most of the loan, the New York 
Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
Although it involved no criminal behavior, the loan is an example of the kind 
of poor lending practices that led to the thrift industry's troubles, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
California Federal Bank of Los Angeles ending up buying the failed thrift, 
Broward Federal Savings and Loan of Sunrise, Fla., from federal regulators two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Jeb Bush transaction was unrelated to civil charges that the president's 
youngest son, Neil, 35, acted improperly in his role as a director of Silverado 
Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. That S&amp;L failed in 1988 
after making questionable loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami deal involves Jeb Bush, 37, and his partner, Armando Codina, who own 
a partnership called 1390 Brickell. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the two bought a Miami office building at that address for $9 million. 
They used a $7-million mortgage from an insurance company and a $4.6-million 
loan from Broward Federal Savings and Loan of Sunrise, Fla. The surplus money 
was to be used for improvements and a reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
The loan from Broward Federal was obtained through J. E. Houston Financial 
Group, headed by J. Edward Houston, a former associate of Bush and Codina. 
</P>
<P>
Broward Federal became insolvent in 1988, and the federal government paid more 
than $4 million to make good the loan on the Miami property as part of the 
bailout of the S&amp;L industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Codina negotiated a settlement with regulators in which they repaid 
$505,000 and retained control of the building, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
It said Bush and Codina expressed surprise that the settlement could be 
interpreted as use of taxpayers' money to bail out the loan. Asked if they were 
aware that the money for the repayment came from taxpayers, both said no. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials defended the agreement, saying that it was the best 
settlement available because of the weakened commercial real estate market in 
Miami and because the loan was secured by a risky second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
They said Jeb Bush received no preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit between the 1390 Brickell partnership and Houston over who should pay 
back the $4.6 million was settled out of court under the auspices of federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
They were authorized to step in because of a Dec. 31, 1988, agreement under 
which the assets and liabilities of Broward Federal were sold to California 
Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for the government to guarantee any loss experienced by 
Cal Fed in taking over Broward's affairs, to pay Cal Fed's costs in managing 
the loans and to pay costs of any litigation to resolve them.

If it can be stir-fried or microwaved, a food item stands a better chance of 
getting attention from importers in prosperous Asian countries, an Agriculture 
Department report says. Consumer tastes are changing in Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
Fast foods, Western-style meals and a growing interest in healthful diets are 
making an impact. "Asian consumers are also returning to their culinary roots, 
seeking out traditional foods, but with a new twist: convenience," said Violet 
Oon, a food editor in Singapore. "The result is a desire for tradition in a 
packet that can be defrosted or microwaved." Oon, writing in the November issue 
of AgExporter magazine, said the new trends in Asian eating didn't develop 
overnight. Basically, she said, the changes in consumer tastes are linked to 
rising disposable income, openness to imports, a receptive news media and 
growth of the middle class. Singapore is "on the leading edge in consumer 
tastes" among the countries of Southeast Asia, Oon said. As countries develop 
economically, more and more consumers eat out as women join the work force. And 
domestic help is hard to come by.

Asia-Pacific nations say they do not want to form a trade bloc confronting 
North America and Europe, but economists warn that they may be forced into it 
unless world trade is liberalized. "Events in North America and Europe are 
driving the world that way. 
</P>
<P>
An Asia-Pacific trade bloc is emerging by default," says a recent report by the 
Australian-based Center for International Economics, a private research group. 
Asia-Pacific countries worry that the European Community's plan to become a 
single market in 1992 could make it a "Fortress Europe" that would resist 
imports. The free trade zone comprising Canada and the United States, which 
Mexico may join, has aroused similar fears. A three-way split in world trade 
will emerge unless countries commit themselves to removing trade barriers, says 
the research group's report, which was commissioned by the Confederation of 
Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry. A Reuters survey shows that the 
12 nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, formed last year, 
reject the idea that the organization will become a closed trading system.

As Vietnam's relations with the West slowly improve, Japanese investors and 
traders are cautiously returning to a country that they have shunned for 15 
years. A spokesman for the trading firm Toyomenka Kaisha, which is building a 
factory in Vietnam to make glue, said: "It has become easier to start a 
business in Vietnam with less foreign pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is revitalizing. Labor costs are cheap and raw materials 
plentiful." In dealing with Vietnam, most Japanese firms have been using front 
companies while concealing their own names. But as the political climate 
improves, more and more are throwing off the disguise. Official Vietnamese 
figures show that Japan was the fourth-biggest foreign investor this year, with 
$71 million in six projects, after France, Britain and Belgium. The Japan 
External Trade Organization, a semi-governmental agency, said Vietnam still had 
a long way to go before it became an attractive investment because it was 
handicapped by poor roads and inadequate power supply.

Japan surpassed Britain last year to become the world's fourth-largest beer 
brewer, a Japanese beer company says. Kirin Brewery Co., Japan's biggest 
brewery, said world beer production rose 2% in 1989 to a record 28.8 billion 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record was 28.2 billion in 1988, company officials said. The 
largest producer by far was the United States, with 6.07 billion gallons, up 
0.6% from 1988, Kirin said. U.S. brewers accounted for 21.1% of global 
production, the officials said. They said West Germany was second followed by 
China, Japan and Britain. The figures are based on data from beer associations 
around the world, Kirin said. In terms of per-capita beer consumption, the 
average West German downed 37.5 gallons in 1989, closely followed by East 
Germans, Czechoslovaks, Danes and Belgians, the officials said. They said the 
average American drank 23.3 gallons in 1989, while an average Japanese consumed 
12.3 gallons.

MAGNET SCHOOLS DETER IMMIGRANT PUPILS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CRITICS SAY A DEARTH OF BILINGUAL TEACHERS IN TOP-FLIGHT CLASSES 
SHUTS THE DOOR TO MOST GIFTED BUT LIMITED-ENGLISH CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Most immigrant students are excluded from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's highly lauded magnet schools, intended to provide top-flight 
education for high-achievers, because nearly every class is taught only in 
English, according to some educators and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 4% of the 30,000 students enrolled in magnet schools spoke limited 
English, compared to 35% of the district's students. The district this year is 
providing bilingual instruction in just 13 magnet school classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say they are meeting the demand for Spanish-language 
instruction at magnet schools and that many Latino parents don't want their 
children bused to magnet schools outside their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
But School Supt. Bill Anton agreed that the low enrollment of limited 
English-speaking students at magnet schools points to a problem. "It's not the 
way it was set up," he said. "We have to find out why we are not having 
(bilingual) programs in the magnet schools." 
</P>
<P>
Some education and legal experts say the numbers are appalling and blame the 
district for failing to recruit more non-English speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you have schools that are set up to provide specialized instruction to 
students of the district and one significant group of students are effectively 
shut out, you have both a legal and ethical problem," said Peter Roos, an 
attorney with Multicultural Education Training and Advocacy, a national 
public-interest law firm specializing in educational rights of minority and 
immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
Roos and several other public-interest attorneys are preparing to go to trial 
early next year in a 4-year-old lawsuit alleging that the district is unfairly 
spending more money and employing more experienced teachers at schools with 
higher than average enrollments of white students, such as magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
The district reserves between 30% and 40% of the seats in magnet schools for 
Anglo children, although they make up less than 15% of the district's total 
enrollment of 625,000. Together, Anglo and Asian students make up nearly half 
of the magnet school enrollment, even though the two groups make up only 20% of 
district enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a general attitude that the limited English-speaking student is a 
second-class citizen," said Juan F. Lara, a professor at the Claremont Graduate 
School and a resident scholar at the Tomas Rivera Center, a national institute 
of policy studies. "Look at school districts with large limited 
English-speaking populations and it becomes patently clear they are considered 
an expendable population." 
</P>
<P>
District officials say there are no barriers to magnet schools. A magnet school 
brochure, including a version in Spanish, is distributed to students once a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"All children may apply to magnet programs, we never limit it," said Assistant 
Supt. Theodore T. Alexander Jr., who heads the district's magnet schools and 
other voluntary integration programs. "But it is a misconception that everyone 
in the district wants to be in a magnet." 
</P>
<P>
The district's magnet schools and centers, which share facilities with regular 
schools, have for years finished far ahead of the city's regular schools in 
almost every measure of academic achievement including test scores, graduation 
rates and college eligibility. Tens of thousands of children are on waiting 
lists for magnet schools, which can accommodate fewer than 10,000 new students 
each school year. 
</P>
<P>
The district does not keep track of the language proficiency of its magnet 
school applicants. But district officials say a shortage of bilingual teachers 
and a reluctance by immigrant parents to send their children to schools outside 
of their neighborhoods probably discourages limited English-speaking students 
from applying to magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
District records show that last year 1,237 limited English-speaking students 
were enrolled in 93 magnet schools and centers, which by design offer the sort 
of equipment, curriculum and teachers found only in the best private schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 8,000 students enrolled in 27 magnet schools and centers for only 
high-ability and gifted students, only 102 were Spanish-speaking, district 
records show. Another 200 or so gifted students who spoke languages other than 
Spanish or English were enrolled in those schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Euclid Avenue School's bilingual magnet center -- which opened last year -- 
is the first and only in Los Angeles to offer classes in Spanish for gifted and 
high-ability students, generally children who score in the top 2.5% to 4% on 
standard IQ tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad fact is students aren't being identified as gifted until they learn 
English," said Euclid Principal Esther Castruita-McShane. 
</P>
<P>
Bright immigrant children should be identified as gifted or high ability and 
then offered special programs in their native language while they learn English 
part of the day, said Sandra Kaplan, a visiting professor of education at USC 
and the assistant director of the Los Angeles-based National/State Leadership 
Training Institute on the Gifted and the Talented. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan has developed a series of tests to identify gifted students who speak 
languages other than English. Teachers at Euclid Avenue School have been using 
her techniques and this year identified 33 students as gifted. 
</P>
<P>
The school board in May, 1988, voted to give priority to the hiring of 
bilingual teachers for magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Magnet schools are the best kind of schools the district has to offer," said 
Eastside board member Leticia Quezada, who pushed for creation of the Euclid 
Avenue magnet school. "The fact is we spend more money in magnet schools 
compared to regular schools." 
</P>
<P>
The magnet school system was created nearly 15 years ago.

DEMOCRATS PUSH MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO RECRUIT VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Double Rock Baptist Church Pastor Joseph Holmes never mixes politics with 
religion in his services, but on Sunday he made an exception for Democratic 
officials who arrived with armloads of absentee ballot applications for his 
Compton congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"This application is better than money in the bank -- it's the future of your 
children," City Councilwoman Patricia Moore told the 1,000 church members 
shortly before Holmes delivered his own sermon. "Please fill it out and give it 
back to us." 
</P>
<P>
In a major bid to get out the minority vote in the heart of heavily Democratic 
Los Angeles, campaigners promoting absentee voting visited more than 75 South 
Los Angeles churches to instruct people how to fill out the applications and 
then "vote in the comfort of your own home by mail," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Absentee voters are traditionally conservative and Republican, and the 
Democratic effort to generate new votes in poor and minority communities is an 
attempt to counter that trend. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic political leaders believe working-class blacks were all but 
forgotten in the 1982 election for governor between George Deukmejian and Tom 
Bradley, which Deukmejian won by 93,345 votes. 
</P>
<P>
They are determined not to make the same mistake in the Nov. 6 gubernatorial 
contest between Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community was taken for granted without any effort to get out the vote by 
those supporting Bradley. Compton alone could have generated 50,000 votes," 
Moore said. "We are here for Dianne Feinstein and every other Democratic 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Since the law changed in 1976, registered voters can request an absentee ballot 
without explanation. Before, voters had to prove that they were not ambulatory 
or were going out of the state on election day. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Democrats are viewing absentee ballots as a way of helping people whose 
days are consumed by long hours at work and other pressures in communities like 
Compton, where 47% of all males between the ages of 18 and 35 are unemployed, 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The applications handed out at churches Sunday were attached to a flyer 
emblazoned with a slogan tailored for otherwise apathetic black voters: "If 
Nelson Mandela had the right to vote, he would. . . . Vote Democratic for all 
offices." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fact that on Election Day in black communities people find a thousand 
reasons for not going out to vote," said Basil Kimbrew, who, with Moore, was 
spearheading the absentee ballot drive among "captive audiences" in South Los 
Angeles churches. "Our goal is to target occasional voters and turn out 400,000 
additional votes in the process." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who filled out an application at the Compton church was Kerry 
Island, 31, who did not vote in the last election, even though the poll was 
located "just around the corner" from his Compton home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a struggle just to take care of my family on odds and ends jobs," said 
Island, who hasn't been able to find a steady job in three years. "If we get 
enough people to vote maybe it won't be so rough out here." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Simpley, 23, of Long Beach, said the absentee ballot he expects to mail 
in November will be "the first time I've voted." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a car, so it is kind of hard to get around," said Simpley, a 
receiving clerk who rides a bicycle to work each day. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said that although he is "adversely against politicians interfering in 
the morning worship hour," he agreed to let Moore and Kimbrew speak to his 
congregation largely because "Pat Moore is a believer who comes to church 
whether she is campaigning or not." Beyond that, he said, "it is important to 
counter the apathy that permeates our community." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had Holmes concluded a fiery sermon on "A Satisfied Soul" than 
Kimbrew positioned himself at the front door and asked every person leaving the 
wood and stucco church building, "Have you filled out your application? It only 
takes a minute." 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday night, he said, "We collected 575 applications at Double Rock, and 
more than 4,500 at all the other churches."

CRIME: THE VICTIMS INCLUDE A 4-YEAR-OLD BOY AND A GIRL, 16, IN SEPARATE 
INCIDENTS.

<P>
A weekend of violence left at least 20 people dead and more than a dozen others 
wounded countywide, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's homicide detectives were investigating the apparent murder of an 
elderly woman in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors heard gunshots and called deputies, who found the unidentified woman 
dead inside her home in the 600 block of Durwood Drive shortly before 7 p.m. 
Sunday, Lt. Robert Flores said. Deputies held a man and woman found hiding in a 
side yard for questioning, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police were investigating two unrelated stabbing deaths Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were investigating the death of woman whose body was found 
about 6 p.m. Sunday in a pickup truck on Las Virgenes Road in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Compton detectives were investigating the death of an unidentified young man in 
the 2600 block of North Parmelee Avenue about 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Police did not 
immediately know how the person died, "but there appears to be some trauma to 
his head," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, Jesus Zubia, 24, was booked for investigation of murder after his 
son was shot at their home, although investigators believe the shooting was an 
accident, Police Sgt. Percy Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Zubia told officers he thought his .38-caliber revolver was unloaded Friday 
night when he showed it to his two sons, ages 4 and 7, and repeatedly pulled 
the trigger. The gun fired once, and the 4-year-old was shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police hunted for the killers of a cab driver whose body was dumped 
on a street near downtown Los Angeles. Stanley Kolski, 53, was found shot in 
the head Friday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a man who refused to share some cocaine was stabbed to death Sunday 
morning in Venice, and in the east county community of Walnut a man was found 
shot to death outside his apartment building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven people were wounded in an apparently gang-related drive-by shooting near 
Los Angeles City College. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old girl was fatally wounded shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday as she rode 
in a car with friends in the Willowbrook area, sheriff's deputies said. People 
in the car had exchanged "gang words" with pedestrians, who opened fire, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Sandoval, of Los Angeles, died at a nearby hospital. A male suspect, 
whose name was not released, was in custody for investigation of murder, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
A drive-by shooting claimed the life of a 19-year-old Los Angeles man early 
Sunday after he was struck by gunfire from a passing car on West 22nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, one man was killed and another injured in an apartment window 
after exchanging taunts with some people on the street, one of whom pulled a 
gun, police said. There were also shooting deaths at a Highland Park 
intersection and near a Los Angeles hamburger stand. 
</P>
<P>
Six other people died in weekend violence previously reported by The Times.

L.A. WOMAN IS ATTACKED WHILE JOGGING IN CENTRAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jogging in New York City's Central Park in the autumn twilight, Deborah 
Maxwell-Dion of Los Angeles knew her honeymoon might take an ugly turn Saturday 
when she saw three teen-age girls use an umbrella to try to knock down a 
cyclist just ahead of her. 
</P>
<P>
She signaled for help from her husband, running about 20 feet ahead on the 
path, just a few hundred yards from last year's notorious "wilding" gang rape. 
But it was too late: The girls encircled her, making sarcastic remarks about 
her being "out of breath." 
</P>
<P>
Then, the white victim told police and recalled in an interview Sunday, the 
black girls knocked her to the ground as they shouted racial and sexual slurs. 
Less than 10 yards away, about five or six teen-age boys cheered on the 
teen-agers with chants of "Go, go! Get her!" Maxwell-Dion and her husband, Hal 
Dion, said. 
</P>
<P>
Dion, 35, raced back to his 30-year-old wife and pulled her to safety as the 
girls threatened to "cut up" the couple, he said. After a verbal confrontation, 
he found police, who arrested the three girls near the scene on suspicion of 
assault and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell-Dion said she suffered bruises on her shoulder and back. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, I'm fine," said Maxwell-Dion, an actress and faithful runner who 
plans to return with Dion today to their home near Griffith Park. "But the 
worst part is that it makes me scared now, and I've never had that in me 
before. I like to run by myself but now I don't feel like I can . . . even 
after I get back to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
After Mayor David Dinkins heard about Saturday's 5:15 p.m. attack, he called 
Maxwell-Dion from his car phone to apologize on behalf of the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, aware that the city's reputation as a tourist capital has been 
tarnished in recent months, wanted to "express his hope that (the couple) would 
not interpret this as anything more than the isolated instance that it was," 
press secretary Albert Scardino said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the names of the girls -- two are 14 and one is 15 -- 
because they are juveniles. They were released into the custody of their 
parents or guardians and will appear in family court to face charges of 
juvenile delinquency, third-degree assault, harassment and disorderly conduct, 
Officer Scott Bloch said. Investigators have classified the assault as an 
official "incident of bias," Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack comes at a time when New York City has drawn attention because of a 
sharply rising rate of violent crime. It mirrors two of the most notorious 
recent crimes that involved Central Park or an out-of-town visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a female jogger was gang-raped by a group of teen-agers in Central 
Park in a case that brought the term "wilding" to national attention. And last 
month a 22-year-old tourist from Utah was stabbed to death in a subway station 
while trying to protect his mother from robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Dion said the couple had stopped for the weekend in New York, where each had 
lived at length, after a monthlong honeymoon in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional day," said Dion. "We've just come out of this with a 
feeling that we were so lucky that she wasn't hurt more badly. . . . You think 
about the potential of what could have happened -- that's what scares you the 
most." 
</P>
<P>
Dion said the three girls appeared ready to continue kicking and beating his 
wife when he intervened. As other joggers and cyclists in the busy thoroughfare 
looked on, Dion said, one runner helped him get his wife to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought Central Park was one of the nicest places in the world to 
go running," Dion said. "And then something like this happens. You feel like 
you survived a shark attack."

REGION OF BRAIN PROVIDES STORAGE OF NEW MEMORIES

<P>
New memories are processed in the hippocampus over a period of several weeks 
before being permanently stored elsewhere in the brain, psychiatrists Stuart M. 
Zola-Morgan and Larry R. Squire of UC San Diego reported last week in the 
journal Science. The new discovery helps to explain why damage to the 
hippocampus, common in some types of degenerative diseases, interferes with the 
victim's ability to learn. 
</P>
<P>
Zola-Morgan and Squire trained 18 cynomolgus monkeys to correctly choose one 
member of 100 pairs of objects. The objects were learned in groups of 20 at 16, 
12, eight, four and two weeks before 11 of the monkeys had their hippocampuses 
surgically damaged. When the animals were retested two weeks after the surgery, 
the undamaged animals could remember more than 80% of the objects learned in 
the four weeks immediately before surgery, whereas the damaged ones could 
remember only 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Both damaged and undamaged monkeys, however, could remember about 70% of all 
the objects learned more than eight weeks before the surgery, indicating that 
those memories were safely stored elsewhere in the brain.

SCUBA DIVER DIES, PARTNER MISSING OFF LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside County man died and his scuba-diving partner was missing Sunday 
after an accident off Long Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Linder, 24, of Corona died in a decompression chamber on Santa Catalina 
Island after he surfaced unconscious Sunday morning, said U.S. Coast Guard 
spokeswoman Kristine Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
His diving partner, whose name was not released, could not be found as rescue 
vessels combed the waters six miles southeast of Long Beach Harbor until dusk, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't plan to continue the search," added Coast Guard Lt. Chris Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Linder was part of a four-member group on a morning dive. After 
surfacing, Linder was taken by friends to a nearby oil platform before Coast 
Guard helicopters transferred him to the Isthmus Dive Chamber in Avalon, where 
he was pronounced dead.

SCORES ARE FLABBY IN PHYSICAL FITNESS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ONLY 21% OF THE COUNTY'S FIFTH-, SEVENTH- AND NINTH-GRADE STUDENTS 
REACHED OR EXCEEDED MINIMUM LEVELS IN THE STATE EXAMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like their schoolmates statewide, the majority of Ventura County students who 
were evaluated in a state physical fitness test are out of shape and unable to 
meet the minimum standards, according to a report released today by the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Only 21% of the county's fifth-, seventh- and ninth-grade students reached or 
exceeded minimum levels of fitness as measured in the five-part California 
Physical and Health-Related Fitness Test, given last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Intended to measure cardiovascular endurance, strength and general fitness, the 
test included sit-ups, pull-ups, a mile-long walk or run and an exercise called 
sit-and-reach, which gauges flexibility. The test is part of the California 
Assessment Program. 
</P>
<P>
Many county districts opted not to do the fifth portion of the examination, in 
which a caliper measured loose skin on the arm and calf to determine the 
percentage of body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Some district officials said they did not have personnel who were trained to 
use calipers properly. In addition, some teachers did not want to do the 
skin-fold test, because it required touching students' bodies and raised the 
possibility of being accused of sexual impropriety, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The skin-fold test was optional and did not count in the final results, state 
education officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 23,375 Ventura County students who took the test, Moorpark Unified, 
Oxnard Union High and Ojai Unified had the highest percentages of students who 
passed the four physical-exercise sections. 
</P>
<P>
County fifth-graders and seventh-graders scored below the state average, but 
ninth-graders were slightly above average. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-grade students tended to perform better than younger students, although 
the test took age and sex into account by requiring less of fifth-graders than 
of seventh- or ninth-graders. It also set lower standards for girls than for 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
For example, ninth-grade boys were required to run or walk a mile in 7 minutes 
and 45 seconds or less, while fifth-grade boys were given 9 minutes and 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
And while ninth-grade boys were required to do four to five pull-ups on a 
chinning bar, girls of all ages had to do only one pull-up to meet minimum 
requirements for upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
At Matilija Junior High School in Ojai, several girls who took the test said 
they were unable to complete even one pull-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing pull-ups was hard," said Shyle Ruder, 13, who passed the other three 
fitness requirements. "I couldn't do one." 
</P>
<P>
Dee Bennett, girls' gym teacher at Matilija, said her students do sit-ups as 
part of a daily warm-up routine and run an average of a half-mile each day. 
Girls also do gymnastics regularly for upper-body strengthening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This test is definitely in our minds" on a daily basis, Bennett said. 
"However, we feel that sit-ups and push-ups are always good." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, girls outpaced boys in the sit-and-reach exercise and in running, 
while boys beat girls in pull-ups, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
County and state education officials said the overall poor showing is part of a 
nationwide trend of declining fitness among America's youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is generally accepted that a lot of students are not as physically 
fit as they used to be," said Gina McMillan, curriculum coordinator of the 
Pleasant Valley Elementary School District. "A lot of students play soccer, 
dance and do other physical activity after school, but a lot of them go home 
and watch television." 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Oxnard Elementary School District had the lowest performance in 
the county. Only 8% of students who took the test passed, compared with 21% for 
both the state and the county. Sixteen percent of Oxnard elementary students 
did not complete even one of the four components. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Supt. Norman Brekke said he had not seen the report, but said the 
district was continuing efforts to review how physical education is taught 
based on low scores from the 1988-89 school year, the first year the test was 
given. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been efforts made to strengthen the program," Brekke said. "There's 
a continuing need to monitor what we're doing against what the state tests are 
showing." 
</P>
<P>
Although a relatively high number of students in the Oxnard Union High School 
District passed the test, the district showed a slight decline from the 
previous year in every area, said Bert Pearlman, director of curriculum and 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"This does concern us," Pearlman said. "We are presently redesigning our 
physical fitness program to ensure that students are getting proper training 
that will help them with their attitudes toward physical fitness, as well as 
develop the body strength they should be enjoying in their youth." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of diet and exercise, already covered in health courses, will 
receive greater emphasis in gym classes, Pearlman said.

In Moorpark, scores were above state averages as well as up from the previous 
year, particularly for seventh-grade students. A revamping of the physical 
education program two years ago is beginning to pay dividends, said Assistant 
Supt. Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The revised programs emphasize more calisthenics and aerobic exercises 
beginning in elementary school, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not checked the staff for flab lately, however," Smith joked. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the second year for the physical fitness test, and it is too soon 
to tell whether regular testing will eventually improve fitness among 
schoolchildren, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't see any trend yet," said Susan Sundell, a state education programs 
assistant in Sacramento. "We need three to five years to show improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Because of budget cuts to the California Assessment Program, it is uncertain 
whether the test will be administered next spring, state officials said. Some 
districts said they may continue testing students on their own even if a 
statewide comparison is not available. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad," said Robert Isenberg, director of special programs and testing in 
the Simi Valley Unified School District. "To have it stopped now I think does a 
disservice."

<P>
A reputed gang member attempting to hide from three carloads of rivals was 
gunned down on a North Hollywood street Sunday night, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Jose Jimenez, 18, of North Hollywood, died after he was shot once in 
the upper torso as he tried to hide in the 6800 block of Gentry Avenue about 
9:45 p.m., Lt. Michael Ranshaw said. Ranshaw said the fatal shot was fired from 
one of three passing cars carrying about 10 members of a rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
"One shot, one hit, one dead," Ranshaw said. "Very efficient." 
</P>
<P>
The three cars sped away after the shooting. No one had been arrested this 
morning, and police were searching for suspects.

A 20-year-old woman reported missing more than two weeks ago recently notified 
police that she is safe and living with a family in Los Angeles County, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tufa Petelo arrived at the Anaheim police station Friday and told officers that 
she left home Sept. 26 after receiving a severe beating from the woman who 
reported her disappearance, Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Petelo informed police of her whereabouts when she heard they were conducting 
an extensive missing-person search but declined to press charges in the alleged 
beating, Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed that she was beaten severely on Sept. 25 or 26 by the same 
person who reported her missing," Hedgpeth said. "This caused (Petelo) to run 
away. In her mind, she left for her own safety." 
</P>
<P>
Futatia Tausili, 48, the Anaheim woman who reported Petelo missing, originally 
told police that she is Petelo's aunt. Police have since confirmed that the two 
women are not related. Tausili could not be reached for comment earlier today.

A woman in military fatigue clothing and her 11-year-old son, who was dressed 
as a girl, were arrested in the slaying of the woman's mother, one of 27 people 
who died violently at the hands of others over the weekend, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old woman, Roma Jual Jacobs, died shortly after she dialed 911 from 
her home in La Canada Flintridge on Sunday night to report she had been 
stabbed, sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
"Deputies also heard gunshots over the phone," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies converged on the home minutes later, they first found a 
43-year-old woman dressed in camouflage fatigues and her 11-year son, wearing 
"female" clothing, in a side yard. 
</P>
<P>
After forcing their way into the house, they found Jacobs' body. She had been 
stabbed and shot numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested the woman, identified as the victim's daughter, and her son 
in the slaying. Deputies did not immediately release their names or discuss a 
motive for the slaying.

Tuberculosis is resurging after decades of decline, killing nearly 3 million 
people worldwide annually and threatening to claim even more lives unless quick 
action is taken, health officials warned today. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization reported that progress against TB, a contagious 
disease of the lungs and other organs, has "come to an abrupt halt" in some 
industrial countries, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the number of reported TB cases has almost doubled in some east 
and central African nations over the last four or five years, WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 8 million people annually develop new cases of TB. About 20 
million people worldwide have active cases, and another 1.7 billion are 
carriers of TB bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
"Countries with the highest rates of HIV (AIDS virus) infection and high 
numbers of TB carriers are recording explosive rates of TB," said Dr. Arata 
Kochi of WHO, explaining that people whose immune systems are crippled by the 
AIDS virus are more susceptible to tuberculosis.

The government of President Elias Hrawi moved today to reunify Beirut by 
dismantling the Green Line that has split the Lebanese capital into Muslim and 
Christian sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud ordered military police to stop 
lawlessness by some leftist and Muslim militias that moved into the enclave of 
defeated Gen. Michel Aoun in the Christian heartland outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian and Lebanese troops crushed Aoun's 11-month mutiny in an air-and-ground 
assault Saturday that left 160 people dead and more than 800 wounded. Aoun took 
refuge in the French Embassy, where he remained today while Lebanon and France 
argued over French efforts to move him to exile in France. France has been the 
traditional protector of Lebanon's Christians.

President Bush said today he and both GOP congressional leaders are "on the 
same wavelength" in preferring a Senate committee's bipartisan deficit 
reduction proposal over a House Democratic plan. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters before leaving on a two-day, five-state political 
swing, Bush also renewed his attack on Congress for failing to complete work on 
a budget and deficit-cutting plan. 
</P>
<P>
And the President again refused to clarify publicly which higher taxes he would 
accept as Congress struggled to complete its budget work by Friday's deadline, 
when a bill temporarily funding government operations will expire. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said repeatedly he would not sign another stopgap spending bill to 
keep the government functioning beyond Friday unless Congress sends him a 
budget and deficit reduction plan by then that he can accept. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who met today with Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House 
Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois, said the three of them "were 
pretty much on the same wavelength" in preferring the deficit-reduction package 
approved early Saturday by the Senate Finance Committee.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth is accused in sworn affidavits 
of encouraging four girls aged 13 to 16 to join him for a nude swim at a 1981 
pool party, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The statements were made by Liane Nelson, now 23 and a social worker dealing 
with sexual abuse cases in the Boston area, and her cousin Elizabeth Mulay, 22, 
of San Jose, the Star Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The two women said Grunseth also encouraged his daughter Nina to swim in the 
nude at the Fourth of July party at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Nina Grunseth denied the charges in her own affidavit, and her father said 
supporters of Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich were trying to blackmail him into 
dropping his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I regard this as an absolute outrage," Grunseth told the newspaper. "But what 
is going on here, I'm convinced beyond any doubt, is a creation of the Perpich 
camp." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 14 at the time of the party, said she decided to speak out nine years 
later because she believes there was sexual impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is extremely inappropriate behavior for someone who wants to be 
governor," she told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavits from Nelson and Mulay, two other teen-age girls in 
the pool, including Nina Grunseth, removed their swimsuits at Grunseth's 
urging. Grunseth and one or more of his adult male friends also took off their 
suits, Nelson and Mulay said. 
</P>
<P>
"He suggested we all take our swimsuits off," Mulay said. "My cousin and I were 
adamant about not taking them off. . . . At one point, (Grunseth) cornered me 
in the pool. I tried to swim by, but he blocked me in." 
</P>
<P>
Mulay said Grunseth at one point tried to touch one of her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I became afraid and swam under his arms and got away. I was very angry and got 
right out of the pool," her statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Grunseth, who was 35 at the time and a businessman, described his 1981 party as 
a well-attended, wholesome event. 
</P>
<P>
Perpich said he had no previous knowledge of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had no part in it," Perpich said.

"We are not heading toward a major inventory correction that would lead the 
economy into recession," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank 
in Pittsburgh. "Businesses are better able to keep a firm hand on their 
inventories." 
</P>
<P>
In July, inventories climbed 0.7% and sales dipped 0.4%, according to the data 
compiled by the department's Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Inventories totaled $806.48 billion in August against $802.15 billion in July, 
and sales totaled $551.86 billion in August against $540.37 billion in July, 
adjusted for seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also said in its monthly report that the 
inventory-to-sales ratio, which tracks product delivery time, slipped to 1.46 
in August from 1.48 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers' inventories scored the biggest gain in August, a 1.3% jump, hinting 
perhaps that consumers were more conservative with their money after Iraq's 
invasion of oil-rich Kuwait early in the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are becoming cautious about spending," said Cynthia Latta, an 
economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. "By the time they fill up 
their gas tanks to go to the mall, they don't have enough money to spend at the 
mall."

DOLLAR DIVES AGAINST YEN ON JAPAN EXCHANGE

The dollar dived against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today as investors became 
more pessimistic about the U.S. economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 128.15 yen, down 1.15 yen from Friday's close of 129.30 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
It opened at 128.55 yen and ranged between 127.95 and 128.72. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's closing was its lowest since 127.63 yen on March 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar has become less attractive because of growing pessimism over the 
U.S. economic performance," a Mitsubishi Bank dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar will quickly fall further once it breaks the 128-yen line, which is 
a resistance point," said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno told a news conference, however, that the 
market sees little possibility of the dollar plunging. 
</P>
<P>
Mieno also said there had been unavoidable stock price declines reflecting a 
correction of the "bubble effect" of asset prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo market's leading index has declined this year from a record high 
exceeding 38,900 points at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But on the stock exchange today, the 225-issue Nikkei stock average surged 
719.04 points, or 3.21%, closing at 23,109.20. The index fell 195.47 points 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the yen's strength, stability in bond prices and relative calm in 
the Persian Gulf region contributed to today's surge in the Nikkei.

IBM said today that its profit jumped nearly 27% in the third quarter despite 
weakening economic conditions at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp. said net income for the three months 
ended Sept. 30 totaled $1.11 billion, or $1.95 a share, up from $877 million, 
or $1.51 a share, in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose nearly 7%, to 
$15.28 billion, from $14.30 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Overall sales slipped 1.5%, to $9.01 billion, but revenue derived from support 
services, software, equipment rental and financing posted double-digit 
increases over the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings were slightly below the expectations of industry analysts.

5 LEADING INSURERS AT RISK OF INSOLVENCY, REPORT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: A CONSUMER GROUP'S ANALYSIS OF THE TOP 20 COMPANIES WARNS THAT A 
SEVERE CRISIS COULD CRIPPLE SOME FIRMS AND FORCE THE PUBLIC TO BAIL THEM OUT.

Five of the nation's top 20 property and casualty insurance companies are so 
financially shaky that they could go broke in the event of a severe economic 
downturn, the consumer group Public Citizen said today. 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen said Aetna, American International Group, the Hartford Insurance 
Group, Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty each triggered 
four of six factors that, according to the group's analysis, would make them 
vulnerable to insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for some of the firms took issue with the report and said their 
companies are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer group said none of the five companies are on the edge of 
insolvency but "the underlying weakness in their financial condition is clearly 
evident." 
</P>
<P>
The 124-page report said a combination of low premium volume, high claims and 
weak return on investment could mean potential financial trouble for the 
companies. It said all of these factors occur during an insurance cycle 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
"The failure of just one insurance giant would overwhelm the state funds 
designed to protect policyholders," said Joan Claybrook, president of the 
consumer group. "The result could be another taxpayer bailout on the model of 
the savings and loan industry." 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen made its analysis in part by examining shrinking surpluses, the 
ratio of surplus to losses and unusually wide premium swings over the years 
1969 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It also examined three short-term factors: the amount of risk the company 
insures compared to the size of its cushion against unexpected losses, the 
degree to which its investments could be converted into cash and the extent of 
its investment in high-risk junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Smith, senior vice president and comptroller for AIG, said he was 
"flabbergasted" that his institution would be considered vulnerable. "They 
either used the wrong facts or they got the wrong numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Willis, a spokeswoman for the Hartford Insurance Group, said she 
questioned the credibility of the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies included in the survey were Allstate, Cigna-INA, Chubb, CNA, 
Continental, Crum &amp; Forster, Farmers, Fireman's Fund, Kemper, Lincoln, 
Nationwide, St. Paul, State Farm, Travelers and USAA.

The Colts had today off, and Dickerson was expected to rejoin his teammates for

Dickerson, who had threatened to retire from football and was suspended and on

RAY LEONARD, HBO CUT TIES AFTER 12 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: THE CABLE NETWORK, UPSET AT NOT BEING ALLOWED TO BID FOR HIS NEXT BOUT, 
DROPS THE FIGHTER AS A COMMENTATOR.

Sugar Ray Leonard will serve no longer as an HBO championship boxing 
commentator because the cable television network is miffed about not having a 
chance to be involved in Leonard's next fight. 
</P>
<P>
"He will fight again," Mike Trainer, Leonard's lawyer, said today. He also said 
that Leonard's behind-the-mike contractual relationship with HBO was virtually 
at an end anyway and that "Ray indicated to me he didn't want to continue it 
because it interfered with some things he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
In announcing that he was releasing Leonard from his contract after 12 years of 
telecasts for HBO, Ross Greenberg, vice president and executive producer for 
sports, said in a statement: "We are saddened to end our broadcasting 
relationship with Ray this way. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, however, after more than a decade of work together in the ring 
and behind the microphone, HBO was not offered an opportunity to bid on the 
telecast rights to Ray's next fight by has adviser-lawyer Mike Trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel therefore if HBO is treated in this fashion, it is inappropriate for 
Ray to continue as a commentator on world championship boxing telecasts." 
</P>
<P>
"The fight he is talking about is a rumored fight between Ray and Terry Norris, 
the WBC junior middleweight champion," Trainer said by telephone from Las 
Vegas, where he is serving as consultant to Steve Wynn for the James (Buster) 
Douglas-Evander Holyfield title fight, which will be held Oct. 25 at the Mirage 
casino-hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer said that Leonard, who has won world titles in five weight divisions, 
would probably fight "somewhere at the end of January" and that Terry Norris 
"is a leading candidate as his opponent." 
</P>
<P>
"There never has been a linkage between his broadcasting and his fighting," 
Trainer said, adding that Leonard had only one or two make-do telecasts left 
with HBO. These were makeups for telecasts he had missed while training.

VIRGINIA RISES TO TOP IN AP POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, Virginia, you really are No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers completed their startling climb to the summit of college football 
today, replacing Michigan as the No. 1 team in the Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's 31-0 thrashing of North Carolina State and Michigan State's 28-27 
upset of Michigan lifted the Cavaliers to the top spot for the first time in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the personnel and the coaches to go all the way," defensive end Chris 
Slade said. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach George Welsh says it's too early to speculate about a national title 
for his 6-0 Cavaliers, who were No. 2 last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really into the rankings at this point," Welsh said. "We've still got 
five more games to play." 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, Virginia was never ranked higher than ninth. But after 
starting out 15th in the preseason poll, the Cavaliers moved steadily upward as 
many of the top teams lost or tied. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Virginia is No. 1, Welsh said it likely wouldn't make the Cavaliers 
any more of a target for their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in the Top 10 was the big difference," he said. "If teams are preparing 
for you, I don't think No. 2 or No. 1 makes any difference." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia received 38 first-place votes and 1,454 points from a nationwide panel 
of sports writers and broadcasters. Once-beaten Miami, which defeated Kansas, 
34-0, Saturday, was second with 15 first-place votes and 1,414 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee moved up two places to third after drubbing Florida, 45-3. The 
Volunteers, unbeaten but twice tied, got two first-place votes and 1,354 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated Nebraska is fourth, followed by Auburn, Notre Dame, Florida State, 
Illinois, Houston and Michigan. Nebraska was rated the top team on three 
ballots, while Notre Dame (4-1) and Houston (5-0) each got one first-place 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
USC moved up one spot, from 16th to 15th. Washington, the only other ranked 
Pac-10 school, moved from 17th to 14th. Oregon, a 38-17 loser to Washington, 
and Arizona, which was beaten by Oregon State, 35-21, dropped out of the 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated Georgia Tech got the biggest boost, from 18th to 11th, after edging 
Clemson, 21-19. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska jumped three places after routing Missouri, 69-21. Auburn moved up a 
notch to fifth after beating Vanderbilt, 56-6, and Notre Dame rose two spots to 
sixth with a victory over Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State, Illinois and Houston each climbed three rungs. The idle 
Seminoles moved up to No. 7, the Illini rose to No. 8 and the Cougars vaulted 
to No. 9.

SEAGAL'S MARTIAL ARTS FILM STILL HAS A PUNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second week in a row, Steven Seagal proved hard to top at the weekend 
box office. 
</P>
<P>
20th Century-Fox's "Marked for Death" -- starring and co-produced by the former 
martial arts instructor -- had ticket sales of $7.4 million, a 
per-screen-average of nearly $3,800. 
</P>
<P>
This brings its total grosses to nearly $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros.' "Memphis Belle," about the final mission of a celebrated World 
War II bomber crew, came in second with opening weekend ticket sales of $5 
million, for a per-screen average of $4,625. 
</P>
<P>
The news was less uplifting for the weekend's other new titles. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Destiny," produced by Disney's Touchstone Pictures, starring Jim Belushi 
in a "It's a Wonderful Life"-like fantasy, had ticket sales of $2.9 million for 
seventh place. It opened on 727 screens, where it averaged $4,115. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures' "Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael," a coming-of-age 
comedy-drama starring Winona Ryder, took ninth place with $1.7 million in 
ticket sales on 635 screens -- an average of $2,762. 
</P>
<P>
In limited release, Orion Pictures' "The Hot Spot" -- about a steamy Southern 
love triangle, directed by Dennis Hopper and starring Don Johnson -- had ticket 
sales of $112,188 on 23 screens, for a per-screen-average of $4,874. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the weekend's top 10, in approximate figures, were (3) "Ghost" 
(Paramount), $4.2 million; (4) "Fantasia" (Buena Vista), $3.9 million; (5) 
"GoodFellas" (Warners), $3.6 million; (6) "Pacific Heights" (Fox), $3.5 
million, and (7) "Postcards From the Edge" (Columbia Pictures), $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In 10th place was Universal Pictures' "Henry &amp; June." The first film to 
carry the NC-17 (adults-only) rating, the sexually provocative period drama had 
ticket sales of $1.4 million on 189 screens, for an average of $7,408.

COMEDIAN BUSH-WHACKS ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK RIZZO, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Morris was terrified. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, George Bush was elected President, succeeding Morris' endless supplier 
of comic material, Ronald Reagan. Would Morris become a lame-duck 
comedian-impersonator and go the way of Kennedy mimic Vaughn Meader and Nixon's 
comic embodiment, David Frye? 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
The quintessential impersonator of Reagan as dithering Dad quickly 
metamorphosed into a whining, WASP-ish Bush. And before you could say "read my 
lips," Morris was doing a mock inauguration of George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing Bush before I was doing Reagan, in the spring of '80," Morris, 33, 
said. "After that, Bush became the Invisible Man, and I put him on the back 
burner." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush had changed a bit in the intervening years, said Morris, who had to 
rework his impersonation into a sort of amalgam of Liberace, Jack Nicholson and 
Mister Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush sort of dropped his consonants in a weird attempt to be an everyday, 
middle-American guy. He'd say things like, 'We're goin' fishin'.' He also 
learned to bring his high-pitched, whiny voice down to a very controlled 
delivery. He also restricted the use of his hands, at least in the contrived 
presentations like the stump speech. But when he gets excited, his voice goes 
high and whiny again, and his tongue wags and his arms flail, and that's what I 
pick up on." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said that he sees dissimilarities in the way both Presidents like to be 
perceived, which affects how Morris portrays them. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush really likes to be perceived as a hands-on person who is on top of 
everything, whereas Reagan really played up the point that he wasn't. In fact, 
that was his way out of the Iran-Contra mess. He pleaded 'nolo brain.' " 
</P>
<P>
Morris is not under any illusions that the impersonator is more than a shadow 
of the person he imitates. 
</P>
<P>
Morris has performed before Bush three times, most recently at the annual White 
House Correspondent's Dinner. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a Bush-whacking problem for Morris on these occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"Would I pull any punches because he's a likable guy, especially in person? But 
I realized I wouldn't respect myself if I didn't give him the full guns. So 
that's what I did, and as it turned out, he has a very good sense of humor 
about himself." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Bush has not taken Morris up on his offer "to come in three times a 
week to get on the phone to other world leaders to free him up."

MUSIC AND MESSAGE MIX IN RICHIE HAVENS' ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH BEST, STAMFORD ADVOCATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to keep up with Richie Havens has never been an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for his mystical performance as the first performer on the stage at 
the Woodstock Music &amp; Art Festival in 1969 and a series of solo albums, 
Havens has always been a man in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Havens has spent the last couple of weeks singing, traveling and working on 
several of his environmental and educational projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I went from New York to Prague in two days," he said over the telephone from 
his New York office. "I was invited to do a TV show that was shown in Italy and 
distributed throughout Europe. It was called 'Freedom.' Joe Cocker and Billy 
Preston were there, too. They had 50,000 people out there in the town square." 
</P>
<P>
For Havens, there was no hesitation to jet over to Czechoslovakia for the 
opportunity to reach yet another international audience, because for the 
singer-songwriter, environmental and peace activist, music is the medium for 
his message. 
</P>
<P>
"Youth around the world are in agreement that music is a way to talk to each 
other," he said. "It is a viable tool for passing information from youth to 
youth. That's what's been going on, since rock 'n' roll was invented. Rock 'n' 
roll was a primal scream of the first-born, postwar babies. It was an actual 
social phenomenon that was commercialized. We're in the pangs of invention 
again, because kids have invented their own sound -- rap." 
</P>
<P>
Primary on his activist agenda these days are his projects aimed at children. 
Along with Michael Sandlofer, he is the co-founder of the North Wind Undersea 
Institute on City Island in New York City, an innovative organization that 
serves as a "hands-on" educational experience for anyone interested in learning 
about the ocean, but particularly children. 
</P>
<P>
The institute has also pioneered painless devices to rescue whales and is 
working with harbor seals to teach them how to rescue people trapped 
underwater. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Guard, an extension of the museum, is an environmental organization 
that is bringing the more educational aspects of the institute to cities across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing the Natural Guard under the umbrella of the environment, because 
it (the environment) exists everywhere," Havens said. "We realized that 
children's minds take a lot of information from TV, so children need to get a 
way to address their own problems -- all of the problems of the community, not 
only the city but the country, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only do that when you start to learn that it is ecological safety that 
is part of the (total) community. As an example, the 'Just Say No' (drug 
campaign) was wrong because it treated kids as potential drug takers. We have 
to empower them as peer groups to help their friends." 
</P>
<P>
Even with all his outside activities, Havens still finds time for music. 
</P>
<P>
He recently began work on a new album for CBS Records, his first major record 
deal since his days with Warner Brothers Records. He will head to California to 
work on the album, which will be a mix of new Havens compositions and 
interpreting songs by other, primarily new writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to find songs by young people talking about what is happening now," he 
said, noting that one song he will likely record is Cyndi Lauper's "Time After 
Time."

HIGH COURT GETS TOUGH ON OBSCENITY; 
</P>
<P>
RULING: THE JUSTICES LET STAND THE FORCED CLOSURE OF ADULT BOOKSTORES AND VIDEO 
SHOPS IN VIRGINIA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court boosted the federal government's crackdown on obscenity today 
as it let stand the forced closing of three adult bookstores and nine video 
rental shops in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments by the businesses' 
owners, who were convicted of racketeering and selling obscene materials, that 
the subsequent seizures of the businesses violated their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case, but four votes are 
needed to grant such review. 
</P>
<P>
The seizures were carried out under provisions of the federal Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Those convicted of 
participating in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering may be forced 
to forfeit all assets and proceeds stemming from the illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
The justices were told that the Virginia case is the first prosecuted under 
RICO in which the racketeering activity charges were based entirely on 
obscenity crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Obscenity was added in 1984 to the long list of underlying crimes on which a 
RICO prosecution could be based. 
</P>
<P>
"The court's determination of the validity of post-judgment forfeiture in this 
case will have enormous impact upon the future of RICO obscenity prosecutions, 
both state and federal," lawyers for the convicted business owners said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis and Barbara Pryba, owners of the corporations that operated the 
bookstores and video shops in northern Virginia, were convicted of selling and 
distributing obscene magazines and videotapes worth about $105. 
</P>
<P>
An employee, Jennifer Williams, also was convicted on obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Pryba was sentenced to three years in prison and five years probation, 
and was fined $75,000. Barbara Pryba was given a suspended prison sentence and 
fined $200,000. Williams was given three years probation and fined $2,250. 
</P>
<P>
One of the corporations the Prybas owned also was fined $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
After a separate jury trial, a federal judge ordered that all assets -- 
including corporate stock, inventory, bank accounts, automobiles and office 
furniture -- be forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
The convictions and forfeiture order was upheld by the U.S. 4th Circuit Court 
of Appeals last April. 
</P>
<P>
In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Prybas and Williams argued that 
forfeiture of businesses engaged in constitutionally protected activities -- 
the distribution of materials not found to be obscene -- amounts to an 
impermissible "prior restraint" of speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Although obscenity itself is a crime, a past finding of obscenity has never, 
in this court's view, justified a ban on further communicative offerings," the 
appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration urged the justices to reject the appeal.
