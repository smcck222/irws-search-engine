NURSE FACES TRIAL IN ROOMMATE'S SLAYING IN ALLEGED INSURANCE SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Called to a house on a quiet Van Nuys street nearly 4 1/2 years ago, police and 
paramedics saw the aftermath of an unusually brutal crime. Stephen Eldridge, a 
27-year-old self-employed landscape architect, had been stabbed 44 times. His 
body lay mutilated and bleeding in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Police and paramedics were struck almost immediately by several peculiarities 
about the death. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge's roommate, Maureen McDermott, had been in the house during the murder 
-- Eldridge's body was found, in fact, after McDermott called the 911 emergency 
line to report that three robbers had knocked her unconscious as she took a 
bath while at home alone. 
</P>
<P>
But although it might be assumed that vicious killers would not want to leave 
witnesses, authorities said, McDermott had herself received injuries so mild 
that they didn't even require a Band-Aid. Jewelry and expensive items in plain 
view had been left untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the temperature of the bathwater, still tepid hours after 
McDermott said she had been attacked. Odder still, one of the paramedics had 
been called to the same house barely a month earlier to treat Eldridge for a 
bizarre knife attack by two intruders, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Now, three years later, McDermott, a registered nurse at County-USC Medical 
Center held in high esteem by her bosses and co-workers, is about to go on 
trial in Van Nuys Superior Court for murder and attempted murder in Eldridge's 
April 28, 1985, death and a March 21, 1985, attack on him. 
</P>
<P>
An attractive 42-year-old woman, McDermott is accused of masterminding a scheme 
to kill Eldridge so she could collect on a $100,000 mortgage insurance policy 
that the two took out when they became co-owners of a home on Killion Street in 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend in court files that McDermott hired James Flores Luna, a 
hospital orderly with whom she worked, to kill Eldridge, ordering him to cut 
off Eldridge's penis in hopes that authorities would attribute the death to a 
homosexual quarrel. Prosecutors contend that McDermott had Luna tie her up and 
inflict slight injuries so she would not be a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Luna, 36, of La Puente is expected to be the key prosecution witness in 
McDermott's capital murder trial, which is scheduled to begin the middle of 
this week and is expected to last through January. 
</P>
<P>
Because prosecutors are alleging two special circumstance allegations -- that 
McDermott killed Eldridge for financial gain and that she lay in wait to carry 
out the killing -- she faces the death penalty if convicted. She has pleaded 
not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Luna pleaded guilty in August to a charge of murder with special circumstances 
after being promised that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty against 
him if he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to testify against McDermott are Marvyn and Dondell Lee, brothers 
from Los Angeles who prosecutors say helped in the killing. The two have been 
promised immunity in exchange for testifying against McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ingber, one of McDermott's two court-appointed attorneys, said the charges 
will be proved false. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being a killer, McDermott spent "most of her life engaged in the 
process of helping human beings" and, if anything, was too naive and 
kind-hearted for her own good, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miki," as her friends called her, met Eldridge at a gay bar they both 
frequented near her home. When Eldridge said he needed a place to stay, 
McDermott kindly gave him a half-interest in her home in exchange for $10,000 
and the promise of some remodeling work, Ingber said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott was a dedicated and hard-working nurse whose employee evaluations 
over the years showed her work to be not just good but outstanding, Ingber 
said, a point not disputed by prosecutors. Her superiors and co-workers "were 
all shocked by her being charged. Many will testify on her behalf," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors paint a picture of McDermott as a woman leading two distinctly 
different lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a number of people who would say she was the most caring, 
compassionate, warm person on the face of the earth and another group who 
thought of her as extremely manipulative, greedy and evil," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Kathryne Mader, the prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In court files, prosecutors allege that McDermott let Eldridge move in not out 
of kindness but because she was in debt and wanted somebody to pay half the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage insurance was purchased by Eldridge and McDermott in December, 
1984, with first right of ownership of the house and $100,000 going to the 
survivor if either died. Soon after, McDermott set about arranging Eldridge's 
death, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony from McDermott's January, 1987, preliminary hearing, 
Eldridge told Los Angeles police that he was attacked in the home by two men 
who banged on his door and told him that someone was trying to steal his truck. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge told police that one of the men, later identified as Luna, ordered him 
to drop his shorts and crawl into a bedroom. There, the man clubbed him on the 
head and used a knife to make many small slashes in his back and buttocks, the 
police officer quoted Eldridge as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge said he escaped by pushing the men aside and yelling as he ran out the 
front door, the officer testified. McDermott, who prosecutors contend planned 
the attack, showed up while paramedics were preparing to take Eldridge to the 
hospital, the officer testified. 
</P>
<P>
Mader portrayed McDermott as a woman so cold-blooded that she cared for and 
comforted Eldridge after the March 21 attack, while secretly plotting the 
second attempt on his life. 
</P>
<P>
"McDermott was nursing Steve and dressing Steve's wounds and then going to the 
pay phone and calling the killer and saying, 'Come back -- and do it again 
right next time,' " Mader said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the frightened Eldridge confided to a friend that he felt most 
secure when McDermott was home with him, Mader added. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department paramedic Steve Brunett testified at the preliminary hearing 
that he and his partner answered McDermott's call for help at the same house 
shortly before midnight on April 28, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott told Brunett that she had been taking a bath and had answered the 
door to find two men who asked her for money, the paramedic testified. When she 
said she didn't have any, they beat her into unconsciousness and left her with 
her hands tied, he quoted her as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from slight cuts on the cheek, breast and thigh and bruises around her 
left eye, McDermott seemed unharmed and needed no treatment, Brunett testified, 
so the two paramedics got ready to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in what prosecutors contend was a panicked attempt to make sure that the 
paramedics discovered Eldridge's body, McDermott said she needed to go to the 
bathroom to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
En route, she pointed to some blood in the hallway, prosecutors said. "That 
must be from one of the cats," Brunett quoted McDermott as saying. Brunett said 
he followed the trail of blood to Eldridge's body. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Luna inflicted McDermott's injuries at her request so 
she would appear to have been assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott was arrested in May, 1985, and released without being charged, then 
rearrested in August, 1985, at her mother's home in Philadelphia after a 
lengthy police investigation.

DRUGGED OUT; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICERS WHO LOST POLICE CAREERS TO COCAINE COUNSEL OTHERS TO LEARN FROM THEIR 
MISTAKES

<P>
Former Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Scott Graham never fit the 
stereotype of a drug addict who would risk his career and family to maintain 
his habit. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was arrested in 1985 for withholding cocaine and money seized from 
people he had arrested, Graham was married to his childhood sweetheart. He had 
two children, a house in the suburbs and an expensive sports car. A former 
football and baseball star at El Camino High School in Woodland Hills, he 
excelled at his work as an undercover narcotics officer and was well-liked by 
his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
"I was living my dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clean-cut and blond, Graham looked like the successful adult you'd expect the 
boy next door to become. 
</P>
<P>
But within a six-month period, he lost his car and house, filed for bankruptcy 
and his wife left him -- all because of his drug use. Then he lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, Graham, a drug user since he was 15, had been stealing 
cocaine that he had seized as evidence. He was also taking money from drug 
users in exchange for not arresting them. In October, 1985, Graham and his 
partner, Wayne Desire, were arrested and charged with bribery, extortion and 
cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
After pleading guilty to the felony charges and serving a year in state prison, 
Graham, now 31 and a Granada Hills resident, has remarried. 
</P>
<P>
He and John Jenks of Ojai, another former law enforcement officer who lost his 
job because of cocaine use, have formed a drug-consulting and counseling 
business that has been praised by employers, school districts and PTAs. Their 
fees depend on how much work is involved, they said. Sometimes they charge as 
much as $750; sometimes they work for free. 
</P>
<P>
Both say the business is a logical extension of the law enforcement careers to 
which, as convicted felons, they can never return. Instead of arresting people 
to get drugs off the street, they're getting addicts into treatment, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said he and Jenks are able to relate to drug users better than people 
who have never been addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important things they do is go in and share their own 
experiences," said an Oxnard woman whose teen-age son received help from the 
pair. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she heard Graham and 
Jenks speak at a PTA meeting, then contacted them about her son. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a blessing," she said. "They knew exactly what to do and say." 
</P>
<P>
But others, especially law enforcement officers, say Graham and Jenks are not 
the best examples for children, especially when an investigation into illegal 
activities by 18 members of the Sheriff's Department narcotics unit is making 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have no use for cops who go bad," said one veteran police officer. 
"They give law enforcement a black eye." 
</P>
<P>
Some law officers are also angry because the pair testify as expert witnesses 
for defendants in drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is some acceptance of their work by law enforcement. The 
Sheriff's Department invited them to do a training tape on ethics for recruits. 
They have also conducted classes for the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Jenks said they hope that by telling their stories, they can keep 
others from destroying their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said he started smoking marijuana at 15, then graduated to stronger 
drugs, including Quaaludes, LSD and cocaine. He said he believes that one of 
his teachers was aware of his drug use but looked the other way because of his 
athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I did drugs on a daily basis," he said. "But I maintained a normal appearance. 
I was able to excel in school and sports and still do drugs. That doesn't work 
forever. One day the drugs take over your life. You get found out, and if 
you're not treated, you die. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the great manipulator, the great actor. It was easy for me to fool 
people for all these years." 
</P>
<P>
When he lost his family and went bankrupt, Graham said, "I just went nuts. I 
started to party even more. By this time, I'd started to use cocaine as well as 
smoke weed and drink. You'd think that would be enough to wake me up, but it 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
When he was hired by the Sheriff's Department in 1982, Graham said, he was 
asked in an interview if he had ever used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I'd smoked weed a couple of times, that was all," he said. "They 
believed me. But I was using it daily. I'd smoked a joint on the way to the 
interview." 
</P>
<P>
Graham said he was a good officer. He arrested more criminals than any other 
deputy in the West Hollyood Division. At the Sheriff's Academy, he was elected 
a leader in his 176-member class. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said he justified withholding drugs seized as evidence and taking money 
from drug users by telling himself that the suspects he let go were not hurting 
anyone but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The other people I arrested, like robbers and burglars, were hurting others," 
he said. "I took them to jail." 
</P>
<P>
Graham said he was not discovered sooner because he would pick people who would 
be happy to give up their drugs rather than go to jail. "I had a lot of people 
thanking me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he chose his victims with care; they were mostly professional men who 
drove expensive cars such as Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs and Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dealt with drunks, women or homosexuals," Graham said. "They were the 
ones who would become the most indignant about a cop doing something like that. 
They were the ones who were the most likely to turn us in." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department began to investigate Graham and his partner after a 
lawyer complained to authorities that his client had five ounces of cocaine 
when arrested by the two deputies but only an ounce was turned in for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The pair's arrest in October, 1985, made headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Graham said, he continued to use drugs. "I had lost everything then," he 
said. "You'd think a bell would go off, but it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Out of a job and awaiting trial, Graham even worked for a time as a male 
stripper -- entertaining women at parties -- to support his drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I had sunk to an all-time low," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of his lawyer, Graham pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct 
justice in order to commit felony crimes, including extortion, bribery and 
cocaine possession. His probation report recommended no jail time, but the 
judge decided to make an example of him, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 26, 1987, he was sentenced to two years in state prison. Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz said Graham deserved prison time because of 
"the unconscionable abuse of his authority." 
</P>
<P>
His partner pleaded not guilty. A jury convicted him and sentenced him to four 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Graham was freed after serving a year at the San Luis Obispo Men's Colony and a 
minimum-security facility in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty tough to take," he said. "But I'm not bitter." 
</P>
<P>
While he was in prison, Graham said, he kept it a secret that he was a former 
law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, he has been free of drugs, he said. He credits his 
present wife, Jenny, whom he married in late 1986, and his faith in God with 
keeping him on the straight and narrow. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Graham, also 31, said she married her husband 20 days after they met even 
though he was facing criminal charges and a possible jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew just from talking with Scott that he was a winner," she said. "I knew 
that was just a period he was going through -- that he would pick himself back 
up again." 
</P>
<P>
Graham met Jenks last year when he happened to visit the used car lot in Oxnard 
where Jenks was working as a salesman. 
</P>
<P>
The two men started talking, found that they had a lot in common and decided to 
become partners in a drug-counseling and consulting business in December. 
</P>
<P>
Jenks had already embarked on a personal crusade to educate people about the 
dangers of drugs, speaking to service clubs and PTAs. Instead of moving from 
Ojai, the small community in which he had lived all his life, he said he chose 
to stay and face his hometown head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who were my real friends still are my friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During his 12 years as a police officer, Jenks had earned the Medal of Valor 
for bravery from the Peace Officers of Ventura County and had been named 
Officer of the Year by the Ojai and Port Hueneme police departments. So when he 
was charged with stealing $35,000 worth of drugs from the Port Hueneme Police 
Department evidence locker in November, 1987, Ventura County law enforcement 
was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"Some still are," said Jenks, 36. "As a cop, I know I used to think drug 
addicts were the scum of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Graham, Jenks was spared jail time. Instead, he was placed on five years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Jenks tells schoolchildren, service clubs, law enforcement groups and others to 
whom he speaks that he's lucky to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't gone into treatment, I'd be dead now," Jenks told sixth-graders 
during a recent talk at Las Colinas Elementary School in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Neither said he expects to completely support his family on earnings from the 
drug-consulting business. Graham's wife has her own business. Jenks' wife also 
works, and he has a second career as a private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Both are working toward their advanced certificates in drug and alcohol 
counseling in a two-year program at UC Santa Barbara.

BIKER CRACKDOWN PUTS CAFE IN SLOW GEAR; 
</P>
<P>
BIKERS: OWNERS OF THE ROCK STORE, A CAFE AND GROCERY THAT DRAWS MOTORCYCLE 
ENTHUSIASTS, SAY THEY'RE LOSING BUSINESS BECAUSE OF A CHP ROADBLOCK AIMED AT 
STOPPING MOTORCYCLE RACING ON A STRETCH OF MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hare Kokkinos, a Northridge carpenter taking a break from his latest weekend 
motorcycle odyssey, stood outside the Rock Store and described how Sunday 
afternoons used to be at one of best-known biker pit stops in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"This place was packed with metal; motorcycles were everywhere," said Kokkinos, 
nodding at a long parking lot off Mulholland Highway that fronts the store 
about two miles south of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wall-to-wall bikers." 
</P>
<P>
But lately, Sunday parking has been easy at the Rock Store, a small cafe and 
grocery that draws a wildly eclectic mix of middle-aged pleasure cyclists, 
Hells Angels and upscale "yuppie bikers," including Hollywood figures such as 
comic Jay Leno and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Far fewer motorcyclists rumble 
in now, say the store's owners, Ed and Veronica Savko, who blame a determined 
-- and controversial -- California Highway Patrol effort to stop motorcycle 
racing along the highway's scenic but deadly curves. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 10 weeks, the CHP has erected roadblocks every Sunday along a 
two-mile stretch of Mulholland about 200 yards west of the Rock Store. And 
although authorities say the tactic has eliminated racing, the Rock Store's 
proprietors say it is strangling their long-established business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm down about 85%," said Veronica, who with her husband has run the Rock 
Store for 28 years and is usually known simply as "Vern." 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to force us out of business," Ed insisted. "You wonder if this 
is a police state or something." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, several hundred motorcyclists showed up at the Rock Store for a 
bluegrass jam benefiting a bikers organization that opposes drunk driving. But 
many in the crowd also wanted to show support for the Savkos and to vent anger 
at the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
"The Highway Patrol is not out for a good purpose," snapped a middle-aged 
motorcyclist from Santa Monica who identified himself only as Joe. 
</P>
<P>
"They totaled three patrol cars out here chasing motorcyclists," he said, and 
that made the CHP angry. 
</P>
<P>
In August the Highway Patrol began closing Mulholland, between Kanan Road and 
Seminole Springs Road, every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to all but residents 
and those with business in the area. The roadblocks, which are to be lifted 
Oct. 29, were undertaken as a test program approved by Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP acted because racing "was just getting intolerable," said Capt. Richard 
Kerri, commander of the patrol's West Valley region. 
</P>
<P>
Crashes and injuries were common -- two or three each Sunday, Kerri said. On 
some Sundays, he said, as many as 200 people gathered at an overlook to watch 
the racers speed along the highway, a hilly, twisting road with eye-popping 
views of canyons. So numerous were bikers that some local residents were afraid 
to take their cars on the road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the CHP began stationing two officers, one at each end of the 
roadblock, who stop bikers and tell them the road is closed. If the cyclists 
are trying to reach the Rock Store, they're told of an alternate route, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The action, Kerri said, has ended racing. "We have in effect taken the race 
track away from them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the roadblock didn't stop a large crowd from attending Sunday's 
benefit. The store's parking lot was dense with bikers checking out each 
other's leathers and eyeing a gleaming fleet of Harley Davidsons, BSAs and 
Kawasakis. At least one Hells Angel was in attendance, along with a couple 
wearing black leather vests proclaiming them members of the Christian 
Motorcycle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Savkos and many of their biker-customers agree that something needed to be 
done to slow down racers, especially young men -- some in their teens -- who 
favor high-powered "bullet bikes" that can rocket along at up to 160 m.p.h. 
Older bikers disparagingly refer to such riders as "squids" because, as one 
disapproving middle-aged cyclist put it, "they're all over the road." 
</P>
<P>
But the Savkos and many Rock Store customers believe that roadblocks are an 
unnecessarily Draconian way to handle the problem. Racers could just as easily 
be controlled, they argue, by installing speed bumps or posting officers with 
radar guns along the road. 
</P>
<P>
"No one questions the rationale for the roadblocks. But there is a question of 
if this is the right way to control speeders," said Dean Rigsby, a 
schoolteacher who visits the Rock Store from his home in the Central Valley 
town of Manteca aboard a black Yamaha 920. 
</P>
<P>
Kerri counters that Los Angeles County is reluctant to install speed bumps for 
fear of exposing the county to lawsuits from motorcyclists who might slip on 
them and crash. Speed guns would be ineffective, he added, because of the 
overwhelming number of bikers who formerly used Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
The Savkos also complain that CHP officers frequently harass customers at their 
store and at the roadblock, ticketing them for infractions such as crooked 
license-plate holders or inadequately muffled engines. 
</P>
<P>
"Just crazy things. Just plain harassment," said Veronica Savko. 
</P>
<P>
The couple claims that contrary to Kerri's assertion, officers at the roadblock 
don't inform bikers of an alternate route to the Rock Store -- only that 
Mulholland is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Savko contends that officers "don't like my clientele," wrongly believing 
they are trouble-making, greasy jeaned outlaws straight out of the movie "The 
Wild One." Many Rock Store patrons, he and his wife said, are white-collar 
professionals: doctors, lawyers and entertainment-industry employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The police can't understand why there's never any trouble here," Veronica 
Savko said. "There's no gangs. If the Hells Angels come up here, they take off 
their jackets." 
</P>
<P>
But Kerri said he has no ax to grind against the Savkos or their customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad about their business. . . . They're caught up in this and their 
business is suffering. It's just fallout of our trying to prevent accidents out 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While some nearby residents agree with the Savkos that the roadblocks are too 
harsh, others applaud them, saying the move has eliminated a major public 
safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw many accidents from my driveway . . . saw these kids all broken up and 
dying," said Lawrence Casey, a construction manager whose home is on 
Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, racing "doesn't exist now." 
</P>
<P>
"We're so glad you're here," called a middle-aged woman to a CHP officer 
manning the roadblock Sunday, as she turned her car into a nearby mobile home 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The Savkos claim that Antonovich backs the roadblocks because developers are 
pressuring him to get rid of the Rock Store and its leather-jacketed customers, 
fearing that they might scare off potential buyers of new luxury homes in the

"The kind of people that go up there are 99% family bikers," she said. "They're 
nice people. They're not people Mike would want out of there."

The supervisor decided to support the roadblocks after hearing that in a single 
Sunday, CHP officers were drawn into three high-speed chases with racers, 
Pistone said.

Although the racing problem has been quelled and the roadblocks are scheduled 
to be lifted, Kerri said they may be reimposed if daredevil antics resume.

In the meantime, longtime fans of the Rock Store hope it can survive the 
drop-off in business.

"This is a beautiful joint," said actor Robert Blake, who for years rode a 
Harley Electraglide to the store but now travels aboard an Appaloosa.

"It's an elegant place. To try and close it down is just the heartbreak of all 
time, ain't it?"

SUNNY NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who denounce reporting of "negative" news and opinion by the nation's 
media should take note of the highly enlightening article by Vitaly Korotich, 
editor of the Soviet magazine Ogonyok (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 28). 
</P>
<P>
Korotich writes: "There were times when the bosses loved us (the media)! This 
love reached its peak 10 to 15 years ago, when the press was swimming in a 
torrent of sunny news." 
</P>
<P>
From this I deduce that when the press begins printing only positive news and 
favorable opinion, we would be on the road to totalitarianism.

HEARING TODAY ON ROCKWELL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Assembly subcommittee is scheduled to hold an informational hearing in 
Van Nuys today on contamination and cleanup problems at Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, scheduled from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the auditorium of the State 
Office Building at 6150 Van Nuys Blvd., will be chaired by Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Los Angeles), chairman of the health and welfare subcommittee of the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
An Energy Department report released in May disclosed chemical and radioactive 
contamination in areas of Santa Susana reserved for Energy Department work, 
although officials have said the pollution poses no immediate health threat. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental and neighborhood activists are fighting Rockwell's request to 
renew a special nuclear materials license for Santa Susana's "hot lab," a 
heavily shielded area where remote-control devices are used to dismantle 
nuclear fuel.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 YOUTHS SHOT AFTER 'SKINHEAD' PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three youths who had been at a white supremacist party were shot by an unknown 
assailant after a fight with three minority men at a Van Nuys supermarket, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, ages 17, 18 and 21, were attending a party hosted by white 
supremacist "skinheads" Saturday night at a home near a supermarket in the 6800 
block of Lennox Street. 
</P>
<P>
They went to the market where, about 11:45 p.m., they began fighting with a 
black man and two Latino men, Los Angeles police said. As the youths were being 
chased away, they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they do not know whether the gunman was one of the three who fought 
with the skinheads or whether the shooter was a bystander at the supermarket. 
No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims were found in a park across the street from the supermarket 
and the third was at a nearby home. The 18-year-old and the 21-year-old were 
taken to Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys, where they remained 
Sunday. The third victim was treated and released, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities refused to elaborate further on the incident or to release the 
victims' names and their conditions.

EVERYONE COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The original and major purpose of the U.S. Census was to apportion membership 
in the House of Representatives among the various states. The 14th Amendment to 
the Constitution provides that the seats be distributed on the basis of the 
"whole number of persons" in each state. The census was not supposed to count 
just citizens of the United States or registered voters, but everyone. That is 
the way it should be now, and the way it will be in 1990 provided that Congress 
upholds the position of the House on a controversial census issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 50-41 two weeks ago to exclude illegal immigrants from the 
national population count. On Wednesday, the House, by a vote of 232-184, 
refused to attach such a provision to the Commerce Department appropriations 
bill. The issue is being joined again, however, in the Senate-House conference 
committee appointed to reconcile differences in the two versions of the 
legislation. Congress should stick with the traditional method followed by the 
Census Bureau and count everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to exclude the illegals from the census was, understandably, led by 
members of Congress from states that stand to lose seats during the post-1990 
census reapportionment of the 435 House seats. The illegal population, thought 
to be between 1.7 million and 2.9 million, is concentrated heavily in 
California, Texas and New York. California and Texas are among the states that 
will gain House seats following the census, with California getting five to 
seven new districts. 
</P>
<P>
Washington insiders note that the Senate usually yields to the House on 
redistricting issues and is likely to give up its illegal immigrant amendment. 
That is the proper course to take, not just from the standpoint of California 
political clout to be gained, but as a matter of tradition and equity. Census 
figures are important to states and cities for a variety of other reasons. 
Funds from many federal programs are allocated on the basis of population. And 
while they may not be citizens, illegals qualify for assistance under some of 
those programs. Without a proper federal census count, the state and local 
governments would have to absorb such costs. 
</P>
<P>
A complete count is important for another reason: Many poor people and members 
of minority groups -- transients and street people, for instance -- are passed 
over during the decennial census. Many of the larger cities have been 
undercounted by a substantial number in past censuses. Federal officials 
estimate that as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos were missed in the 1980 census. A 
decision not to count illegals almost certainly would make the undercount 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
A proponent of the failed House amendment claimed that illegals should not be 
counted because they are not entitled to political representation in the House. 
That is a cramped view of what American democracy is all about. One might as 
well argue that only those people who voted were entitled to representation. Or 
only those who voted for the winning candidate. In fact, members of the House 
of Representatives are morally obligated to represent their entire district, 
not just select groups. But first, everyone must be counted.

CLEARING THE AIR IN EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET BLOC: REGULAR DIALOGUE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST ABOUT THE DRAMATIC CHANGES 
IN EUROPE COULD PREVENT DISCORD BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND BONN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is director of European studies at the 
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East German leaders have learned what the Chinese discovered in June: that 
visits by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev can challenge the legitimacy of 
communist regimes. In both cases, anticipation of his arrival helped produce 
mass demonstrations by people seeking glasnost and perestroika. In both, 
confrontation between leaders and led followed his departure. Yet events in 
East Germany are especially ominous, because they are taking place in the most 
heavily armed region on Earth and could undermine Gorbachev at home. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the West has watched in wonder as Kremlin leaders have tolerated 
increasing latitude for East European states and even some Soviet republics. 
Solidarity now leads Poland. The Hungarian Communist Party has voted itself out 
of existence. Latvia has adopted independence as its goal. But tolerated is the 
key word. At some point, won't the Soviet Union see fundamental threats to its 
security and respond accordingly? 
</P>
<P>
Historically, that question applies with greatest force to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Gorbachev seemed to give his blessing to the exodus of East Germans, 
roundabout through West German embassies in Eastern Europe. He apparently 
calculated that only reformist leadership in East Berlin can provide long-term 
stability. By last week's visit, however, he was openly counseling his East 
German disciples to be patient, while tacitly supporting the discipline that 
would inevitably follow his departure. 
</P>
<P>
During the depths of the Cold War, Western observers would have been unstinting 
in praise of courage shown by East German emigres and protesters. Now, when so 
much seems possible in Eastern Europe, there is ambivalence in the West. 
Surely, the reasoning goes, Moscow will not abdicate a decisive role in the 
future of Germany, nor could Gorbachev survive a critical challenge to Soviet 
interests there. But it is impossible to tell how far authority can deteriorate 
in the German Democratic Republic without Soviet action. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the West cannot just hope for the best. While encouraging human progress, 
it must be prepared for the possible failure of reform and the renewal of 
East-West tensions. Two requirements stand out: to learn as much as possible 
about the thinking and likely behavior of the different actors -- especially 
the Soviet Union; and to prevent a political rift between the two key Western 
allies, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the direct approach is to talk about the future, but in both 
cases current means are inadequate. In confronting East-West change, the Bush 
Administration is naturally inhibited in its dealings with the Soviet Union; 
along that route lie charges of "another Yalta." Nor does any existing 
institution bring together representatives of enough governments to permit 
talks that convey political legitimacy and are sufficiently informative about 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
To meet this problem, one institution could be summoned: the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is not due to reconvene until March, 
1992. This 35-nation forum is unwieldy, but within it confidential and 
wide-ranging discussions can properly take place among interlocutors from both 
East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Recalled into permanent session, the conference could become a principal locus 
for exploring the latitude and the limits of change in Eastern Europe -- 
particularly Moscow's willingness to accept challenge to its regional primacy. 
Of course, much would remain unpredictable. But through constant conversation, 
East and West can at least minimize miscalculation and reduce the risks of 
tragedy that, remarkably, virtually everyone now wants to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Equally critical, the United States and West Germany must prevent discord that 
would leave them unprepared to deal with developments, for good or ill, in the 
Soviet empire. In recent months, there has been growing U.S. uneasiness about 
West German actions. Many American commentators have revived fears of German 
unity and economic hegemony in Europe. Some U.S. officials have privately 
questioned whether the Federal Republic's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher, is loyal to the West. And some congressional leaders have been 
harping on divisive issues, including West Germany's reluctance to see 
modernization of nuclear weapons. Predictably, the West German elite resents 
U.S. mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
Rapport between Washington and Bonn is never easy. Differences of language and 
bureaucratic culture intrude; most Americans' limited knowledge of Germany is a 
handicap. But when change impends in Europe, the U.S. and West German 
governments cannot countenance misunderstanding. Something special is needed, 
including permanent "open lines" between the two governments, teams of 
officials regularly working in each other's capital, and regular visits by 
members of Congress and the Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and West Germany -- governments and peoples -- must also 
accept a basic proposition: During the political earthquake in Eastern Europe, 
now spreading to East Germany, they will either regain confidence in one 
another or risk undermining security in Europe.

CHECK THE MIRROR FOR GLIMPSE OF INSANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK S. GOULSTON, Mark S. Goulston is an assistant clinical professor of 
psychiatry at UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why do we willfully ignore the mentally ill and their troubling presence? If 
this avoidance is not willful, how then can we explain our society's continued 
neglect of them? The headlines remind us now and then in an episodic manner: 
funding curtailed again for community mental health centers, despite 
overwhelming need. Lack of funding for emergency psychiatric services forces 
beleaguered professionals to turn away even the severely mentally ill, and then 
care for others by bedding them on pallets on the floor for lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
A jailed person is guaranteed a bed by law; we treat our mentally ill less well 
than criminals. There are no guarantees for the fragile mentally ill who seek 
treatment in our overcrowded county facilities. Last year, every administrator 
of the Los Angeles County psychiatric units signed a "Declaration of 
Conscience" deploring the lack of funding and the abysmal conditions in county 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the mentally ill may be our way of avoiding our own fears: They force 
us to confront our own vulnerabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The truth we cannot acknowledge is that each one of us has suffered from 
moments of temporary insanity. When we slow down when we see a policeman, we 
suffer from temporary paranoia. When we take an idea and invest it with meaning 
it doesn't have, altering its importance out of context with reality, we suffer 
from temporary psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
When we feel we can conquer the world and act without regard to consequences, 
we suffer from temporary mania. When we're immobilized and cannot do anything, 
we suffer from temporary depression. When we cut corners to get ahead at 
someone else's expense, we suffer from temporary sociopathy. 
</P>
<P>
In today's social climate, where the neurological and biochemical basis of 
mental illness is beginning to be understood, the mentally ill are still often 
treated as though the illness they suffer is a moral failing: They could be 
well if they willed themselves so and "cleaned up their act." In this 
environment, the mentally ill feel unsupported and alone -- alienated, 
alienating and, finally, alien. 
</P>
<P>
If each one of us were frozen during a moment of temporary insanity and 
stigmatized like the mentally ill, what would we see on the faces of those 
around us? How would we deal with fear, disdain, pity and even avoidance on the 
faces we love most? 
</P>
<P>
We must admit our vulnerabilities, confess our fears and then feel the common 
bonds of brotherhood that bind us, the "well" and the mentally ill. We must 
confront and conquer ourselves.

</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: CORAZON AQUINO'S LEADERSHIP STYLE, FORGED LARGELY BY HISPANIC 
TRADITIONS, KEEPS HER NATION FROM BEING A REGIONAL ECONOMIC POWER. 
</P>

<P>
By THEODORE FRIEND, Theodore Friend is the president of Eisenhower Exchange 
Fellowships in Philadelphia, Pa., and author of The Blue-Eyed Enemy: Japan 
Against the West in Java and Luzon 1942-1945 (Princeton University Press).

<P>
What haunts the Philippines? The dead mother of Ferdinand Marcos has been lying 
in her parlor, embalmed for public viewing, for a year and a half -- waiting 
for her son, the exiled ruler, to be allowed home to bury her. Now her son is 
dead, yet still forbidden to come home, because his remains could rend asunder 
the body politic. 
</P>
<P>
The widow of the dictator will very likely keep him, too, on public view as a 
rebuke to the Aquino administration. The display of bodies may distract some 
people from Imelda Marcos, who as surviving defendant must still face trial in 
a New York court for embezzlement, fraud and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Corpses above ground in Honolulu and Ilocos Norte, skeletons that refuse to 
stay in closets in New York City: The atmosphere is right for observances of 
All Saints Day in Manila. There, on Nov. 1, the families of the departed will 
flock to cemeteries, celebrate kinship, and observe rituals of Hispanic 
Catholicism. In the grander mausoleums, they will feast heavily and, if 
Chinese, play mahjong. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during Corazon Aquino's 3 1/2-year-old regime, per capita income has 
improved each year; foreign investment, though still timid, shows an accruing 
confidence; the progress of the rebel New People's Army has been arrested, and 
two more of its major leaders have been captured. Public popularity still, if 
less exuberantly than at first, buoys Aquino. With a loyal West Point-trained 
minister of defense behind her, with several mutinies quashed and some 
significant political battles won, she should be a leader in whom success 
breeds charisma, and charisma further success. 
</P>
<P>
But such is not her style. Cory Aquino's charm and power are still derived from 
being more a Mother of Sorrows than a Joan of Arc. She leads by appearing to 
absorb the misery and forgive the errors of her people, rather than by waving 
them on, sword in hand, to victory. In the Philippines, tax collection is still 
thin, the civil service still more patronage-ridden than merit-driven, and 
politics still an anarchy of ruling families mitigated by transient alliances 
among factions. 
</P>
<P>
These defects of governance are part of Marcos' historic legacy. He intensified 
in the Philippines that which resembles not the best but the worst in Latin 
America: autocracy, gross corruption, bloated debt, a deprofessionalized 
military, private armies, death squads. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for any Filipino leader to generate sustained, programmatic 
socio-economic change. Aquino may believe she is trying, but her patterns are 
also neo-Hispanic. It is perhaps significant that the first foreign leader she 
received on a state visit in 1986 was a Latin American -- President Raul 
Alfonsin, who brought democracy back to Argentina. In 1989 he was able, barely, 
to achieve the first peaceful, scheduled constitutional change of power in 
Argentina since 1928. Now his successor, Carlos Saul Menem, copes with 
outrageous inflation, strikes and looting. To prepare the atmosphere for his 
amnesty to military officers involved in human rights violations, he brings 
back from England the bones of Juan Rosas, the brutal caudillo who died in 
exile in 1877. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Ferdinand Marcos will likely come home faster than that. He was 
gluttonous for power and increasingly pompous, callous and cruel. But he 
reigned in an ungrudging country. The Philippine Supreme Court ruled only by 8 
to 7 that Aquino has the right to keep Marcos' body from burial in native 
ground. The court could conceivably, on appeal, reverse itself. 
</P>
<P>
The rattling of bones may obscure the fact that the Philippines does again have 
its preferred form of democracy -- a press free to the point of license, a 
legislature able and willing to oppose or check the president, and a 
self-respecting Supreme Court. Were the body of Ferdinand Marcos soon to come 
home, it could serve as a focus for rightist subversion. That is as saddening, 
in its way, as the necrophilia in Argentina that arose over the late Evita 
Peron. But it is far more sobering to realize the extent to which the major 
dynamics of Philippine public life bear close analogy to retrograde patterns in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
The late Benigno Aquino, whose assassination sparked his wife's ascent to 
power, took heart and examples from South Korean, Taiwanese and Singaporean 
development. But his wife, for all her courage and tenacity, does not have the 
style and values to hold such Asian examples before her people and draw them 
away from Hispanic historical habits. 
</P>
<P>
Disparities of income in the Philippines are the widest in the region. 
Despoliation of timberland is by far the worst in Southeast Asia. And 
population growth, unlike most other parts of Southeast Asia, is running 
unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
The gains of the Philippines in the last 3 1/2 years have been real. But they 
have been limited, constituting restoration instead of reform. The ghost of 
Ferdinand Marcos should not preoccupy Cory Aquino's nation. Its proper concern, 
almost a century after revolt against Spain, is to shake free of Hispanic 
tradition; to leave its Halloween dance among the dead and to join modern Asia.

Jackson did one of his numbers Sunday at the Coliseum as the Raiders beat the

maybe Bo can start at quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Responded Jackson: "You don't get enough action from the quarterback position." 
</P>
<P>
His afternoon began modestly enough: 10 yards in seven carries in the first 
half, when he was telling himself not to try to do too much. 
</P>
<P>
His second half was a little better: 
</P>
<P>
A 19-yard bolt straight up the middle; a one-yard gain; 11 yards on a sweep; 
and for the piece de resistance, a reverse-his-field, outrun-half-the-roster 
burst of 45 yards in which be blew around All-Pro Deron Cherry as if he was 
bolted down. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel sorry for the linemen when he does that," Howie Long said, "but the 
guys you really feel for are the defensive back. The guy's 230 and runs a 4.18 
(40-yard dash). Pick a spot. Where are you going to grab on?" 
</P>
<P>
In all, Jackson gained 85 yards in 11 carries, a 7.7 average . . . and then, 
with 10:07 left and his second career 100-yard game in sight, he was rested. He 
didn't get another carry the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Was there a game Sunday before Bo busted loose? 
</P>
<P>
Yes there was, but it was u-g-l-y. 
</P>
<P>
It cost Schroeder his unbroken tenure as Raider quarterback since returning 
from his opening-day injury 
</P>
<P>
Here are your high points in a capsule: 
</P>
<P>
The Raider defense, No. 28 in a 28-team league against the rush until last 
week, was rocked by the Chiefs' 57-yard touchdown drive on their opening 
possession, set up when Ron Jaworski faked magnificently to Christian Okoye on 
the first play, saw the entire defense follow Okoye around left end, and hit 
Pete Mandley 31 yards downfield. 
</P>
<P>
After that, however, it was good night, Chiefs. Okoye, coming off a 95-yard 
game and three consecutive 100s, owner of a 4.7 average, was held to 52 yards 
and a 2.8. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders took a 10-7 lead at the half on Jeff Jaeger's 18-yard field goal, 
and a late 80-yard touchdown drive, set up by two interference calls against 
Chiefs nickel back, Jayice Pearson. One gave the Raiders a first down after 
Schroeder threw incomplete on third and 17. The other on a third and six, gave 
the Raiders a first down at the Kansas City one-yard line. On the second, 
Pearson was ruled to have interfered with Mervyn Fernandez in the end zone, and 
replays suggested it was a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Raiders care? Two plays later, guess which famous new Raider halfback 
slammed into the end zone? 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Bo knows touchdowns, too. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third period, Jaeger kicked the longest field goal of his career, 
a 50-yarder, and it was 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
It then began to appear that neither team might ever score again. Schroeder was 
five for 16 when Shell reached for his second-string quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein's first drive was a new entrant's dream: hand off, get out of the way 
and watch Bo run around 'em. The Raiders went 70 yards -- Jackson had 56 of 
them -- and scored on Vance Mueller's six-yard run to take a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Beuerlein who hadn't played since the opener, showed his own rust. 
He went one for five and missed a couple of open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
So what have we got now? 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he would figure out who his No. 1 quarterback is later. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even want to think about it," Beuerlein said. "It isn't my decision. I 
don't want to stir anything up." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Schroeder, getting his first real hook of the year, was resigned 
if not overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they wanted to see if they could spark the team," Schroeder said. 
"There's no problem. I can still play and I expect to play. I'm not worried 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised. I wasn't expecting it. Naturally I would have liked 
to throw the ball a little better but there were some situations when I tried 
to make something happen. I've got a few decorations on my back" -- he showed 
off four bruises behind his right shoulder -- "so it's not like I wasn't 
standing in there for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised. We were ahead in the game. I wasn't throwing the ball well, 
but I've been known to come back and put a streak together in my time. I don't 
like to be counted out before the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, he'll retain the privilege of starting against the 
Philadelphia Eagles and Reggie White, so lucky him. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders cruised until the game's final moments, when they let Steve DeBerg, 
in for the injured Ron Jaworski, pass the Chiefs 70 yards down the field, 
cutting it to 20-14 with 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs, of course, tried an onside kick but the Raiders' Mike Dyal 
recovered it and Shell was about to go 2-0, the only undefeated coach in the 
National Football League, season and career. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Shell mused, asked how he planned to keep it going, "I might retire." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was 40,453, the Raiders' smallest of the season and their second 
smallest in Los Angeles, exclusive of strike games. . . . Chief Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer, on the pass interference call in the end zone against Jayice 
Pearson: "I'm not commenting on officiating. If I start now, I'm afraid I won't 
be able to stop." . . . The Chiefs went to a four-receiver set in the second 
half to try to spread the Raider defense and free Christian Okoye, but that 
didn't work, either. "I said before the game, if we could get them out of their 
running formation, we'd win," Howie Long said. "Bernie Kosar isn't playing in 
Kansas City. I'm not demeaning their quarterbacks but Bernie's still in 
Cleveland. Sorry, Marty." . . . And Long on Bo Jackson: "I feel good for him. 
He's a great player and he was under a lot of pressure. Of course, he doesn't 
feel any pressure because he doesn't care about it." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Anderson, the stand-in for Vann McElroy who won last Monday's game with 
an 87-yard interception return, intercepted his second pass Sunday. Between 
Anderson and McElroy, the Raiders have four interceptions. . . . Art Shell 
received his Hall of fame ring in a ceremony before the game. . . . The Raiders 
passed up a chance to try a 46-yard field goal in the last two minutes to try 
to run the clock out, a strategy that backfired when the Chiefs drove down the 
field to cut their lead to 20-14. Shell said they didn't want to take a chance 
on a blocked kick and runback. . . . Ron Jaworski left the game with what was 
first called a sprained knee. The 38-year-old quarterback said later there was 
"some ligament damage." He'll be re-examined in Kansas City today.

DITKA RIPS BEARS AFTER 33-28 LOSS

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Mike Ditka criticized his Chicago Bears, calling them a team in disarray 
Sunday and said, "I don't know if this team can win another football game." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka's comments came after a 33-28 loss to the Houston Oilers. The Bears, 
despite six turnovers, held a 28-19 lead with less than five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Houston quarterback Warren Moon directed a 61-yard drive and scored on a 
one-yard run with 3:38 left. Allen Pinkett ran 60 yards to set up Lorenzo 
White's winning 12-yard touchdown run with 1:46 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the game won, we had it won with six turnovers," said Ditka. "None of 
those turnovers came after we had the lead. Therefore, if we had the lead, how 
come we can't hold a nine-point lead?" 
</P>
<P>
Ditka answered his own question by saying: "We're just not playing aggressive 
football. We looked scared out there. It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 16 of 26 passes for 317 yards, including touchdown passes of 42 
yards to Drew Hill and 45 yards to Haywood Jeffires to cut the deficit to 21-19 
in the closing minute of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for the Bears, marking only the second time 
since 1984 that they had lost two in a row. The other consecutive losses came 
in 1987 to San Francisco and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Jerry Glanville, asked if it was his biggest win, said: "It ranks 
right up on top. When you beat a good Chicago team and a good Chicago coach, 
it's a big win." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears not only lost the game, but they also lost the services of linebacker 
Jim Morrissey, who suffered a lacerated kidney. Morrissey will probably be out 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Morrissey's injury was originally thought to be bruised ribs, which he suffered 
late in the third quarter while attempting to intercept a pass. He went to an 
area hospital after game after he noticed blood in his urine. He was to stay 
overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Bear quarterback Mike Tomczak, who completed 20 of 29 passes for 247 yards, 
threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Neal Anderson in the second quarter, teamed 
with Dennis Gentry on a 79-yard scoring pass play in the third period, and had 
a seven-yard touchdown pass to James Thornton with 4:55 remaining.

MARINO GETS GOING AND STOPS BENGALS' STREAK AT RIVERFRONT

<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Marino snapped out of a first-half slump and revved up Miami's offense with 
his long passing as the Dolphins ended Cincinnati's home winning streak at 12 
games with a 20-13 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Marino, just five of 15 for 59 yards in the first half, completed passes of 41, 
34 and 36 yards to Mark Duper on three separate drives in the second half, 
setting up two touchdowns and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The 17 second-half points sent the Bengals (4-2) to their first loss at 
Riverfront Stadium since the end of the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to end sometimes," said Boomer Esiason, who was bothered all game by 
the Miami pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
"This just goes to show you that even if you feel you have the better football 
team, if there's an explosive guy like that at quarterback, he can beat you." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Miami's fifth straight over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Marino and the Miami offense fizzled in the first half, managing three points 
and 95 total yards. The Dolphins had one scoring threat -- and settled for a 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bengal offense was struggling, too, leaving Miami (3-3) within striking 
distance at the half, trailing only 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
Then Marino took took matters into his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He scored on a one-yard bootleg midway through the third quarter to cut 
Cincinnati's lead to 13-10, set up Pete Stoyanovich's tying 33-yard field goal, 
and drove the Dolphins to the winning touchdown, which came on a five-yard run 
by Troy Stradford with 5:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Miami then held the Bengals and ran out the clock with the help of a 30-yard 
completion to Mark Clayton on a third-down play. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out and threw the ball in the second half, and it worked," Bengal 
cornerback Eric Thomas said. "Marino is one of those guys that no matter how 
much pressure you put on him, he's going to step out of it and get the ball 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Marino completed 11 of 18 passes in the second half for 207 yards and avoided a 
sack to extend the Dolphins' NFL record to 18 games without allowing a sack. He 
also scored his first rushing touchdown since Dec. 7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"They were kind of shocked I was running the ball there," Marino said. "I got 
lucky and got it in there. They weren't expecting it." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals also weren't expecting as much pressure from the Dolphins' defense, 
which led the American Conference with 20 sacks. Miami dropped Esiason three 
times and forced numerous quick throws on third-down plays. Esiason completed 
16 of 24 for 194 yards, throwing for the Bengals' only touchdown after fooling 
the Miami secondary with a play fake.

CHARGERS DON'T GET THEIR KICKS, LOSE TO SEAHAWKS, 17-16 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers are getting better at getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Denver, a fourth- quarter fumble cost them three points. Moments 
later, two defensive penalties led to seven more as they lost to the Broncos by 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at home-bittersweet-home, they allowed the Seattle Seahawks to block an 
extra-point try and a field-goal attempt. Both in the final period. The extra 
point would have tied the game. The field goal would have won it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Chargers lost, 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said Charger defensive lineman Joe Phillips, "is as bad as it gets in 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty bad in the locker room, too. "It's like we're fighting ourselves, 
not the other team," said free safety Vencie Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat dropped the Chargers to 2-4 and into a two-way tie for last place in 
the AFC West. It was also their ninth loss in their last 10 games against 
Seattle (3-3), a team that hasn't won a home game. 
</P>
<P>
After Seahawk end Jeff Bryant looped inside and blocked Chris Bahr's 
extra-point kick with 4:14 to play, the Chargers trailed by one. They got the 
ball back immediately when Lester Lyles stripped return man James Jefferson and 
David Brandon recovered. 
</P>
<P>
But four plays later, Joe Nash also looped to block Bahr's 51-yard attempt. It 
was the fifth field-goal block of Nash's career, a Seahawk record. It was the 
team's second of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Seattle blocked an extra-point kick against Phoenix the second week of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"They block kicks as well as anybody in the league," said Joe Madden, the 
Charger special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Chargers would have gotten one more shot at a game-winning field 
goal if backup left tackle Joey Howard, subbing for the injured Joel Patten, 
hadn't held linebacker Rufus Porter with 20 seconds to play. Howard's hold 
nullified a Jim McMahon-to-Victor Floyd pass that would have given the Chargers 
a first down at the Seahawk 24. 
</P>
<P>
"We made enough errors in the fourth quarter to lose two football games," said 
Charger Coach Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon, who finished with 25 completions in 39 attempts for 286 yards, said: 
"Just like last week."

BRONCOS SHUT DOWN DICKERSON AND COLTS

The National Football League's top-rated rushing defense smothered Eric 
Dickerson and Denver's Bobby Humphrey and Sammy Winder ran for short-yardage 
scores as the Broncos beat the Indianapolis Colts, 14-3, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos (5-1) held Dickerson to 35 yards in 13 carries and the Colts (3-3) 
to 44 yards on the ground and 128 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
That defense mounted a fierce goal-line stand midway through the third quarter, 
as the Colts came up empty on four plays after having a first-and-goal at the 
Denver three. On fourth down at the one-yard line, Dickerson was dumped for a 
one-yard loss by Karl Mecklenburg and Steve Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Horan subsequently punted the ball out of bounds twice inside the 20-yard 
line, helping preserve a precarious 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Following a 24-yard punt return by Ken Bell, who had mishandled two previous 
returns, the Broncos drove for a clinching score with 1:56 left. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Winder, subbing for Humphrey after the Broncos' leading rusher suffered 
bruised ribs in the second quarter, capped the 27-yard drive with a one-yard 
plunge. The touchdown was set up by a 12-yard pass from John Elway to former 
Ram Michael Young on third and nine. Young, from UCLA, is a Plan B free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Verdin's 40-yard punt return to the Denver 46 midway through the first 
quarter set up a career-best 55-yard field goal by the Colts' Dean Biasucci. 
The Colts were blanked the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
After Biasucci's field goal, the Broncos drove 66 yards in 12 plays as Elway 
had 11-yard completions to Vance Johnson and Steve Sewell before Humphrey 
sliced two yards off the left side for a touchdown early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Horan punted 39 yards out of bounds at the Indianapolis 
five. The Colts couldn't advance the ball and punted to Bell, who atoned for 
his earlier misdeeds with his 24-yard return to the Indianapolis 27.

The Lakers led, 50-43, at the half, and Johnson took charge in the third 
quarter. He scored seven straight points with a pair of three-point field goals 
and a free throw to put the Lakers ahead, 83-59, late in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics went scoreless for the first five minutes of the fourth quarter 
and the Lakers easily increased their lead to 101-68.

JACK SMITH: PRESS RECOGNIZES NO SHIELD FOR THE NAKED TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a quality of the bizarre about British news events as reported in 
British newspapers that seems lacking in the American press. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it has something to do with the British stiff upper lip in the face of 
the most sanguinary circumstances. England is the nation, after all, that 
produced Jack the Ripper and Mr. Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
When they do not deal with bloodshed and horror, they are equally provocative 
in reporting the most mundane events, especially those that occur in the 
provinces. I remember the story of a man who sued a pub because his dog was not 
served a beer. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stalcup of Malibu sends me a story from the London Times about an alarming 
rise in the number of postmen who are bitten by dogs. It seems the dogs are 
becoming larger and more aggressive. One is said to have leaped through the 
open window of a postman's delivery van and bit him on the arm. Another is said 
to have crashed through the glass front door of a house in Bristol and attacked 
a postman in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Postmen have tried several defensive tactics, including the use of a whistle 
that emits a sound intimidating to dogs, but with little success. "Postmen have 
also been advised to face dangerous dogs down by getting down on all fours and 
looking them straight in the eye," the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think anyone was quite brave enough to try that," a Post Office 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thomas F. Homann of San Diego sends me a wire story from the Los 
Angeles Daily Journal with the dateline Hull, England. It reports that a man 
who bit his neighbor's dog was fined $373 for cruelty. The defendant, Shaun 
Desborough, claimed that he was trying to calm the dog when the dog bit him, so 
he bit him back. 
</P>
<P>
As every newspaper reporter knows, when a dog bites a man, it is not news; but 
when a man bits a dog . . . 
</P>
<P>
There is also a horrifying little item from The Times reporting that Britain's 
5 million cats kill 70 million smaller animals and birds every year. Mr. Peter 
Churcher, head of biology at Bedford School, said that "well-fed and contented 
cats are often ruthless killers," and are responsible for half the deaths of 
sparrows every year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the news from Ireland is less bloody, for a change. A three-column 
photograph on Page 1 of the Irish Times (I have lost the sender's name) shows a 
young woman climbing quite naked from a pool of water into a crowd of about 40 
persons on the bank. I see the faces of two women in the crowd and five or six 
small boys. The others are yawping men. All are in swimming gear or dressed. 
</P>
<P>
The story explains that the nude swimmer, rock singer Mary Downes, 24, was 
protesting the de facto exclusion of women from the waters of Forty Foot at 
Sandycove, County Dublin, which was described as "a male-only bathing place 
since 1835." Half a dozen other women, topless, joined in the demonstration, 
which attracted a crowd of 500 -- mostly men. 
</P>
<P>
Several men were quoted as sneering at the demonstration as "a cheap publicity 
stunt," but one woman said men made women unwelcome when they tried to swim at 
Forty Foot by crowding around them and dropping their towels. 
</P>
<P>
A 13-year-old boy, Paul Hatton, said he had cycled down from Deansgrange to 
support the women. He said, "I think the women should be able to swim where 
they like." 
</P>
<P>
One man said, "I come here to get some peace away from women. I don't want them 
here. There's lots of other places for them to go to. I'd never gate-crash a 
women's only club." 
</P>
<P>
My sympathies are of course with the women. Why should they have to subject 
themselves to such a humiliating exhibition to gain access to a public beach? I 
must ask myself, though, whether I would have been among that gawking crowd. 
</P>
<P>
I like to think I would have stayed away, out of respect for the women's 
dignity. On the other hand, the women wanted an audience, or what was the 
point? 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, as a gesture of support I'd probably have been there 
watching Ms. Downes climb out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Tell you the truth, I'd probably have ridden my bicycle down.

The American Architectural Foundation has launched a campaign to restore a

months after British troops burned the White House in 1814 and where he signed

said his group wants to raise $2.5 million to refurbish the brick building

Comedian Roseanne Barr may have bared it all at the opening game of the World 
Series in Oakland, but her publicist doesn't know anything about it. With her 
team, the Giants, trailing 5-0 under a moonlit sky, Barr and her fiance Tom 
Arnold reportedly pulled down their pants to express their feelings -- Barr 
revealing a tattoo declaring "Tom" and Arnold baring a tattoo saying "Rosie." 
"I have no idea whether she did or not," Barr's personal manager Arlene 
Rothberg said when asked about the reported crowd "mooning" incident. Other 
more subdued notable fans at the game included Huey Lewis, Tom Brokaw, Peter 
Ueberroth, John Travolta, Michael Keaton, Reggie Jackson and John Fogarty.

One young man was shot and injured and several dozen others sustained minor 
injuries during a melee at a rap concert at the Oakland Coliseum Arena Friday 
night. The show featured Cool Moe Dee, MC Hammer, the Boys and Heavy D. Blamed 
with starting the trouble were about 50 fans who were dressed entirely in 
black, and thought to be members of the Funktown Oakland street gang. Witnesses 
said the fighting broke out when Heavy D refused to go on stage unless the 
house lights were turned out. During the delay, the 50 or so reputed gang 
members reportedly began picking fights at random in the audience, and Henry 
Fields, 19, was shot several times in the abdomen and trunk. He was 
hospitalized in stable condition. The people injured were caught in a stampede 
as panicked concert-goers tried to flee the arena. There were unconfirmed 
reports of a second shooting victim. Of the 14,000 ticket-holders, only about 
4,000 remained in the arena when the headliner Dee appeared, long after order 
had been restored. Shauna Snow

Steven Soderbergh, the young director of the surprise hit "sex, lies, and 
videotape," has received the first John Cassavetes award given to the 
individual who has made the greatest contribution to American independent film 
making this year. The award is in honor of the late director and actor who died 
in February. Soderbergh, the 26-year-old director whose film won the top prize 
earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, received the award at the 
opening of the 12th Denver International Film Festival. Shauna Snow

NBC's remarkable command of the weekly television ratings will almost certainly 
end Tuesday, as a resurgent ABC -- sparked by its World Series broadcasts -- 
makes a bid for the Nielsen pennant. For the first time in 68 weeks, NBC is 
convinced it won't be No. 1 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. weekly ratings, ending a 
winning streak unmatched in television history. "I'm sorry it's come to an end, 
but I hope we start a new streak soon," said Brandon Tartikoff, NBC 
Entertainment's president. "I'd like to start a new one as soon as the last out 
is made at the World Series." Odds are long, though, that NBC -- or any other 
network -- soon will assemble such a string of consecutive triumphs. The 
previous record of 46 weeks was set by CBS in the 1962-63 season. Shauna Snow

POP CAPSULES: X-RATED TRANCE TEXTURES FROM CHRIS &amp; COSEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve &amp; Eydie. Sonny &amp; Cher. The Captain &amp; Tennille. Chris &amp; 
Cosey. 
</P>
<P>
Chris &amp; Cosey? This pair of X-rated, industrial-strength English multimedia 
manipulators probably won't be joining those show-biz couples in any Vegas 
showrooms in the near future. But like many other show-biz couples, Chris and 
Cosey have developed an act reflecting the tastes of their particular audience, 
and their performance at Bogart's on Friday night was pretty much the same show 
they've brought to past Los Angeles appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Against a video collage featuring images of sexual play and subconscious 
disarray, the stone-faced Chris Carter created a synthesized series of sensual, 
cyclic, rhythm-heavy trance textures while Cosey Fanni Tutti, dressed in 
Spandex/bondage finery, whispered dire nothings, blasted a trumpet for a note 
or two, pulled a series of white noise clusters from a guitar, thwacked a drum 
machine and moved and grooved like a dancer in the London girlie bars where she 
once worked. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays there's a slightly sinister sub-text to the couple's sex-and-psyche 
explorations; hearing Cosey murmur "Infectious" against a throbbing, 
midnight-blue sound track has obvious implications. Yet Chris &amp; Cosey are 
not celebrating death; if anything, the physicality of their subterranean dream 
drones investigates the most primal of life forces. And for some, that's 
entertainment.CRAIG LEE

POP CAPSULES: SUDDEN CHANGE OF PACE FOR A MATURING PUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR VALLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes an artist can subvert a carefully crafted image with a sudden change 
in repertoire. Consider Venezuelan heartthrob singer-actor Jose Luis 
Rodriguez's performance on Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre. Maybe it was 
because the half-empty, 6,250-seat house failed to inspire Rodriguez. Maybe it 
was because the Spanish-language soap and film star has matured too much to be 
taken for the ravenous, lovesick Puma for which he is nicknamed. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, during the lion's share of the show that was dedicated to 
the romantic Latin ballads that have made him hugely popular, Rodriguez sang 
with little conviction. Despite the increased richness of his impeccably 
well-phrased voice, his lyrics settled into a saccharine fatigue of easy 
sentiments and quasi-religious nuances. No sexual risks or social transgression 
here. This was especially evident in his schmaltzy rendition of "Ode to Joy" 
from Beethoven's 9th Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a sudden but refreshing stylistic switch, Rodriguez strode on stage 
with Mariachi del Sol Mexican, singing songs from his new Mexican album. 
Rodriguez even seemed to surprise himself as he connected with the raw honesty 
and defiance of "Despacito," a Jose Alfredo Jimenez ranchera classic. VICTOR

GILLIAN WEIR OPENS L.A. BACH FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gillian Weir opened the 55th annual Los Angeles Bach Festival at First 
Congregational Church on Friday evening with a well-chosen, superbly played 
survey of Bach's organ works. 
</P>
<P>
The British organist made it sound almost easy. Her technique is so sovereign 
it does not call attention to itself, or to the complexity and rigor of the 
music. She keeps attention entirely on the musical product rather than the 
performance process, an impression her conservative registration of the large 
Schlicker instrument in the rear gallery increased. 
</P>
<P>
Major pillars of the repertory framed Weir's generous program: the Concerto in 
D minor, BWV 596, and the Prelude and Fugue in D, BWV 532, before intermission; 
the Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542, and the Passacaglia in C minor, BWV 
582, afterwards. She took quick but entirely apt tempos, with only a flustered 
pedal passage at the end of the D-major Fugue to indicate the technical risk 
involved. Otherwise, all was clear and clean, from the densest counterpoint to 
the most dazzling figuration. 
</P>
<P>
In between those big pieces came more intimate fare. The repressed, unbalanced 
registration beginning the Pastorale, BWV 590, was Weir's only sonic 
miscalculation, although she failed to make much of a case for the quirky, 
seldom-played and doubtfully attributed "Kleines harmonisches Labyrinth." The 
chorale prelude "Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland," BWV 659, the Trio Sonata in E 
minor, BWV 528, and the Fantasia in G, BWV 572, were all sharply characterized 
in sound and touch. 
</P>
<P>
The large crowd rose almost as one at the end, a reception Weir acknowledged in 
a regal procession down the center aisle. JOHN HENKEN

'COLD SASSY TREE' PROVES A PLEASANT ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Faye Dunaway gets out and around. Witness her hot-pants Bonnie to Warren 
Beatty's impotent Clyde ("Bonnie and Clyde"), her undercovers investigation of 
Steve McQueen ("The Thomas Crown Affair"), her lover-daughter complications 
with father-dearest John Huston ("Chinatown"). 
</P>
<P>
Her latest machination is staunch, independent Miss Love Simpson to Richard 
Widmark's newly widowed-but-still-heated Rucker Blakeslee. It takes place in 
turn-of-the-century Cold Sassy Tree, which is the name of the pinch-faced 
Georgia town that is set atwitter. 
</P>
<P>
The film, "Cold Sassy Tree," executive produced by Dunaway and Don Ohlmeyer, 
and written and directed by Joan Tewkesbury, is a project of TNT cable, which 
premieres it tonight at 5, 7 and 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's taken from a first novel by Georgia journalist Olive Ann Burns, who was 
setting down reminisences of her father. His is the voice of the story, as 
played by Neil Patrick Harris, the new "Doogie Howser, M.D." He plays Widmark's 
grandson. 
</P>
<P>
Widmark is "a Democrat, Baptist and devout Confederate veteran" who is bent on 
wrenching homilies -- "Livin' is like pourin' water into a Coca-Cola bottle -- 
if you're the least bit scared, you can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Dunaway is a shady lady from Baltimore, who, we learn, has a troubling history. 
The guts of the story is that they marry for mutual convenience, then overcome 
the town's fear of her indifference to the traditional woman's roles. 
</P>
<P>
The town is stumblingly bucolic and the pictures are hazy, as if the movie was 
shot in a dreamlike state. 
</P>
<P>
But the leads are great old pros and it's a pleasant romance. The quibble with 
the casting has more to do with a faulty script, which has characters grumbling 
about their age difference. This is less a May-December romance and more like 
mid-August-December.IRV LETOFSKY

'ROXANNE'S' PRIZE: QUICK DESCENT INTO DEGRADATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For a while there, we media folks were caught up with the beauteous Roxanne 
Pulitzer and her sex groupings and coke snortings and child custody battling 
and generally putting on airs in Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as all good scandals will, she and they have come to television. 
"Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer," based on her book of the same name, starts on 
NBC at 9 tonight and drags on two hours. It's executive produced by Robert 
Halmi, who most recently helped give us "Lonesome Dove." It was written by 
Elizabeth Gill and directed by Richard Colla. 
</P>
<P>
This is Lonesome Roxanne facing life. She's played by newcomer Chynna (as in 
China) Phillips, with Perry King performing as heavy-breathing Herbert Pulitzer 
(as in the newspaper Pulitzers) and Courteney Cox as a hot-eyed Jacquie 
Kimberly (as in the wife of the Kimberly-Clark heir). The real Roxanne passes 
through as a party goer. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to figure just how much true there is in this true story. You'd 
think at least that it's her citing of the truth. At any rate, it doesn't 
matter. The whole enterprise becomes tougher and tougher to watch as her 
journey into degradation becomes more and more sordid and stupid. 
</P>
<P>
It's very difficult to care about these folks, although actress Phillips, 21, 
who was mama and papa-ed by Michelle and John Phillips of the 1960s Mamas and 
the Papas, displays an exciting emotional range, especially for a new kid in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that she doesn't do "dumb" very well, which is what our 
heroine seems to have in extra added abundance. At the very end, for example, 
after all the incredible disasters have befallen her, Roxanne tells us that she 
is now trying to learn from her mistakes. Thing is, I know puppies that learn 
faster than that. IRV LETOFSKY

DEPUTIES SMELLED A STING; TARGET CAME AS A SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY and VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sheriff's narcotics team smelled a sting. 
</P>
<P>
As the deputies secretly watched a suspected drug dealer at a hotel restaurant 
in Sherman Oaks, they thought it odd that he boldly flashed a wad of cash after 
his meal. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, little about the paunchy money-laundering suspect rang true. 
</P>
<P>
Although the IRS had provided the tip, the suspect's name and address seemed 
phony, his penthouse room too flamboyant. His contact, wearing a ponytail and 
snakeskin boots with spurs, looked like a caricature of a Colombian drug 
dealer. The deputies thought he might be a federal agent known as "Snake." 
</P>
<P>
Their suspicions were confirmed when one of them recognized another federal 
agent, then discovered a government car, a telltale Volvo with tinted windows, 
in the hotel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies figured that -- as sometimes happened in their undercover work for 
the Sheriff's Department -- they had tripped over a federal operation. "This is 
a sting," one commented. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. The Aug. 30 stakeout at the Valley Hilton was a videotaped 
federal sting. However, the targets were not the bogus drug traffickers but the 
Los Angeles County sheriff's officers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, nine officers -- an entire elite crew of investigators that 
handled only major drug cases -- were suspended from their jobs, their homes 
were searched and their names were disclosed by Sheriff Sherman Block in what 
he described as the worst corruption case of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the sting were provided by suspended deputies, their attorneys and 
other sources who have seen portions of the government's videotape. Federal 
investigators and the Sheriff's Department declined comment on the account. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape of the 12-hour stakeout has become a crucial piece of evidence in 
an ongoing local and federal probe into allegations that deputies have stolen 
hundreds of thousands of dollars seized during drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Captured on the videotape was dramatic footage of one officer in a suspect's 
hotel suite hurriedly taking three $10,000 bundles of $100 bills from the man's 
shoulder bag and putting them into his partner's leather briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI had planted about $500,000 in cash at the Hilton, but thousands never 
made it to the evidence safe, deputies were told. 
</P>
<P>
The videotape was convincing enough for the FBI, IRS and Block to announce the 
probe at a press conference and subsequently to investigate a flood of tips 
from drug dealers who claimed that deputies stole cash in drug raids. Some of 
the dealers have been granted limited immunity and given polygraphs to test 
their truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Block, who began the probe one year ago, suspended nine more officers on Oct. 
3, and the scandal now appears to be the worst in the history of the nation's 
largest sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed. But the 18 suspensions have raised questions about 
how far the alleged corruption has spread. 
</P>
<P>
Officers in all four of the department's now-disbanded "major violators" drug 
squads have been suspended, as has a narcotics investigator at Industry 
Station, department sources said. Narcotics offices at the Industry, Lennox and 
Carson stations were temporarily padlocked during the second wave of 
suspensions and searches two weeks. The homes of a retired deputy and a Los 
Angeles Police Department narcotics officer were also searched, as was the 
Central California home of a deputy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, documents served in the most recent round of searches sought 
information on 28 officers, including five who were not members of the major 
narcotics units. Even more narcotics officers have been asked by superiors to 
consent to voluntary searches of their homes, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers on whom the probe focuses are mostly respected veterans. 
Competition was keen for the 40 or so jobs on the major investigations squads, 
partly because the pay was exceptional -- many officers make $60,000 to $70,000 
a year -- but also because dress was casual and time clocks were not punched. 
</P>
<P>
The job also carried prestige and a maverick image. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't really know what you do, (so) every once in a while when you come 
up with a lot of dope or a lot of money, they think you're something special," 
said one suspended officer, who like others spoke on condition that he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, the nine officers suspended on Sept. 1, the only nine 
publicly identified so far, formed a top drug team known for its aggressiveness 
and hard work -- both traits of the unit's leader, Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, a 
19-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the hardest charging sergeant I've ever worked for," one officer said. 
"He demanded more out of people, kind of an all-or-nothing type guy. And he had 
that reputation long before he came to dope." 
</P>
<P>
Squad members broke roughly into categories of experience: seven veterans in 
their 40s, and two fast-track, 31-year-olds born only three days apart in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
The younger officers are James R. Bauder, whose retired father had been a 
narcotics lieutenant in the department, and John C. Dickenson, winner of the 
sheriff's top award for bravery in 1988 for going to the aid of an officer who 
had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
Crew veterans were Terrell H. Amers, 22 years in the department; Nancy A. 
Brown, 17 years; Eufrazio G. Cortez, 14 years; Ronald E. Daub, 16 years; Daniel 
M. Garner, 18 years, and Michael J. Kaliterna, 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez, Daub, and Amers socialized together, while the rest of the team 
generally went their own ways except for an occasional party, pre-work coffee 
or post-work drink, some of the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez, Daub and Amers all have new speedboats, and each has bought a house on 
the Colorado River within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The boats and vacation homes of Cortez and Daub were seized last month by 
federal agents who claimed they were purchased with stolen money. Home 
furnishings and cars, including the 1988 Oldsmobile of Daub's mother, have also 
been seized from the two. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Cortez and Daub have said that most of the deputies' large 
purchases were made with money from gifts or with loans, which they are paying 
off with their family incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Amers' vacation home was searched two weeks ago, but neither it nor his new 
boat was seized, said a source close to the deputy. On the day of his 
suspension, however, agents did take a modest diamond wedding ring off the 
finger of Amers' wife of four years. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents also seized last month the 31-foot sailboat that Sobel bought 
for $31,500 in cash and cashier's checks in June. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the suspended officers said that none had habits that 
would require large sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
Of the suspended crew, only Daub was known to gamble regularly. A relative of 
Daub said the deputy once walked away from a Nevada casino with more than 
$25,000 in winnings. An officer said Daub once produced IRS receipts for 
thousands of dollars he had won gambling. Cortez would sometimes accompany Daub 
to Laughlin or Las Vegas, and Amers also joined them at least once, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Daub) has on occasion won money gambling. It's well known," said Jay 
Lichtman, his lawyer. "There's no secret about it. He was thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Cortez and Daub also are known for their strong wills: Cortez as a hard charger 
who makes a striking impression in court by wearing expensive-looking suits and 
a stern face; Daub as a self-assured but moody investigator who looks older 
than his years. 
</P>
<P>
Garner, who holds a college degree, is said to have burned out on narcotics 
work early this year and had been off the job on stress leave until just a week 
before the Aug. 30 sting. 
</P>
<P>
All of the officers have families. And all are now married, except Brown. 
Several have been described as family oriented, and sources said that one 
officer has taken his suspension so hard that he has sunk into a deep 
depression and his family fears he will hurt himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You never expect (the department) to turn on you like this," said a suspended 
deputy. "And the worst part is that once it happens, there's nobody to talk to. 
You ask your (suspended) friends a question, and they don't know why you're 
asking it. They're suspicious. So you're just isolated." 
</P>
<P>
Problems have been compounded for Daub and Amers, whose wives both work for the 
Sheriff's Department, because they have not gone back to work since their 
husbands were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers say they have been watched by undercover investigators since the 
suspensions, and they think their phones are tapped. They still receive 
paychecks, and the department sometimes places phone calls to make sure they 
stay at home during the workday. They say they have been told they will be 
fired if they speak to news reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We know they're surveilling us. We know the guys, we know the cars," an 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of suspension and disgrace was hardly a passing thought early this 
year when "Majors Violators 2" was melded into the squad that was eventually 
suspended. That was when Brown, regarded as an able undercover investigator, 
was added to the unit after a year with a federal Drug Enforcement 
Administration task force, and when the soft-spoken Dickenson was brought in to 
take Garner's place. 
</P>
<P>
Suspended officers said they rarely thought about whether their colleagues were 
stealing money. 
</P>
<P>
"You have ideas, but I didn't care to know," said a deputy, who added that he 
would never have accused a squad member of theft. "That's the last thing you 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Their primary goal, officers said, was to seize cash from drug-money 
launderers, not arrest drug dealers. Given their assignment, some deputies said 
it was inevitable that someone would be tempted to steal money. "It's like 
hiring a guy to be a mechanic, and then they don't want you to be greasy," a 
deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Superiors emphasize cash seizures because the department gets to keep most 
money it confiscates, officers said. The Sheriff's Department reported seizing 
nearly $34 million in 1988, much of it by the four crews that worked major 
cases. Most of that money will eventually be returned to the department. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman said that the seizure of drugs and money are "both very 
high priorities," and equally important to the department. 
</P>
<P>
The Hilton sting demonstrated how quickly and cleanly a cash seizure can be 
made, some crew members said. After $500,000 was taken from the phony Colombian 
dealer in his room, the man signed a waiver renouncing claim to the cash, was 
given a receipt for it, and walked away without being charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
When the man was released, the deputies had gotten less information from him 
than a patrol officer would get from a speeder when writing a traffic ticket, 
one officer said. That the man would give up the money showed he was a 
criminal, but he had committed no crime, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
If drugs had been found with the money, the case would have been more 
complicated. An arrest would have been necessary, and the man could have made a 
legal claim to the money, the officer said. That's why simple money seizures 
are preferred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such quick and available money is what led to the corruption of the crew of 
"Major Violators 2," say federal complaints. Crew members have taken turns 
skimming from millions of dollars in confiscated cash, the documents say. 
</P>
<P>
Videotape recordings of the first hour of the Hilton stakeout show that when 
the suspect left his top-floor hotel room, Deputies Garner and Bauder entered 
it and discovered a bag of money, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bauder took the bag across the hallway to a room where deputies were conducting 
their surveillance through a tiny peephole in the door, sources said. But Sgt. 
Sobel told him to take it back so they would not tip off the suspect and risk 
losing out on an even bigger cache. 
</P>
<P>
The sting tape shows that Garner carried a leather satchel back into the 
suspect's room and that Bauder stuffed three $10,000 bundles into it, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Garner took the bag into the room because it contained a spare gun, radio and 
handcuffs, said his attorney, Harland W. Braun. Bauder apparently took the cash 
as evidence, in case the suspect somehow got rid of the rest, the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Braun said that Garner gave the $30,000 to Deputy Brown, the lead investigator, 
at the end of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Sobel were responsible for all of the money seized, sources said. At 
the hotel, the two officers counted bundles of money totaling about $450,000 
and packed it in two evidence bags, sources said. Meanwhile, the other officers 
were dispatched to look for suspects at two other addresses found on papers in 
the suspect's room. 
</P>
<P>
Once the stakeout was over, Brown, Sobel and Garner all drove to their Whittier 
headquarters, where Brown and Sobel placed the bags in an evidence locker, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Beck, lawyer for Sobel, said he would not comment on the account of money 
handling during the stakeout. Brown could not be reached for comment. Bauder's 
attorney, Richard Hirsch, would not comment except to say that his client "was 
acting in the course of a lawful narcotic investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The snippet of tape showing the transfer of money into the satchel was played 
for some deputies on the day of their suspensions, as was footage that places 
seven sheriff's officers and four Brea policeman in the room with the money, 
for at least a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Brea officers, who served as backup, spent nearly the entire assignment outside 
the Hilton with Deputies Amers and Daub. Lichtman, attorney for Daub, said that 
by the time that group of officers entered the room, the money was sealed in 
evidence bags. 
</P>
<P>
Dickenson, who spent the day assigned to an observation helicopter, never 
entered the room. In fact, one deputy said that he thought Dickenson, a member 
of the crew for just months, has been unfairly tainted. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Cortez in the room, since he had been temporarily reassigned to IRS 
drug investigations, said his attorney, Gregory G. Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
"He was at home with his wife at the time of the videotaping and they (the 
feds) apparently confused him with a Brea police officer," Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the agents arrived without warning at the officers' homes -- 
36 hours after the stakeout -- that they knew their evening's work had been 
recorded and that the sting had been on them, not their Latin suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had a crook at the time," one deputy said. "But we were (the 
ones) surprised." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block announced Sept. 1 that he had 
suspended nine officers in one his "major violators" drug squads pending an 
investigation into whether they pocketed money seized in raids. Nine more 
members of the Whittier-based drug squads were suspended Oct. 3, but no charges 
have been filed in the case.

VIETNAMESE GANGS TIED TO THEFTS OF COMPUTER CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several Vietnamese crime rings based in Southern California are under 
investigation by federal and local authorities for stealing millions of dollars 
worth of computer chips from high-tech companies and selling them on the 
international black market. 
</P>
<P>
The groups operate mostly out of Orange County in the Vietnamese communities of 
Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, investigators said. But robberies as 
far east as Phoenix and as far north as Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay 
Area are being linked to the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits have typically struck late at night and carried out highly 
organized, paramilitary-type missions at some of California's best known 
computer concerns -- binding and gagging workers and routinely issuing death 
threats against them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese subjects come in -- usually four to five at a time -- and 
completely take over a company," said Santa Clara Police Sgt. Pete Pearson. 
"It's totally out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies including the FBI and U.S. Customs Service acknowledged that 
they are looking into the Vietnamese gangs as part of broad investigations of 
microchip thefts and a black market that reaches into Pacific Rim countries 
including Taiwan, Japan and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get a handle on it," said Chuck Latting, an FBI spokesman in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Because chip theft has only begun to emerge as a significant problem in the 
last year, there are no reliable national statistics on the amount or value of 
chips stolen annually. But several major companies have reported large losses 
from the thefts in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Irvine-based computer giant Western Digital Corp. said that 
microchip thefts have cost it $7 million so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a company that hasn't had some form of theft," said Robert 
Erickson, a Western Digital vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Microchips -- which are used in everything from toasters to missiles -- make 
attractive booty because they are small but valuable. Just a handful can bring 
several thousand dollars. Furthermore, very few chips have serial numbers, so 
they are difficult to trace. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, microchip theft is quickly becoming a crime-of-choice for an 
increasing number of people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a disease right now that we are seeing grow in the electronics 
industry and I don't think by any means we've seen the peak," said Lee Roberts, 
a private detective for several corporate victims. "There's going to be more." 
</P>
<P>
Purchasers range from unwitting computer hackers picking up supplies at local 
swap meets to the small electronics shops in the Little Saigon area of Orange 
County that police say fence hot chips and are a key cog in the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, the types of chips being stolen -- mostly DRAMs or dynamic 
random-access memory chips -- retail for either $5 or $15 depending on 
capacity, although in a few instances bandits have made off with chips worth 
$400 each. Thieves then sell them at a reduced price. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices are usually much lower and that's what induces that businessman to want 
to buy that product," said Irvine Police Sgt. Dick Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
The chips are being stolen in three ways -- armed robbery by organized gangs, 
random burglaries and small-time thefts by employees, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Those officials confirmed that there have been at least 12 armed robberies in 
which microchips were stolen in the last year in the Orange County and San Jose 
area, two regions of California with high concentrations of computer companies. 
At least eight of them were carried about by Vietnamese groups. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the heavy Vietnamese involvement in microchip theft is because such 
a high number of them are employed in the electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Express Manufacturing Inc., an electronics company in Santa Ana, was a recent 
victim of an armed robbery pulled off by Vietnamese bandits. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 16, shortly after midnight, owner Chauk Chin was leaving the company 
when two young Vietnamese men approached him, police said. The men pulled out 
handguns and ordered the owner to return to his office. Once inside, they let 
in three accomplices through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
The group's leader was barefoot and dressed in black pajamas. He referred to 
his compatriots not by name but by number. He shouted out instructions with 
military precision. One suspect was ordered to search the premises for more 
employees and found three. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees were bound with their arms behind their backs using duct tape," 
said Santa Ana Police Detective Bill Chaney. "Legs were taped together and eyes 
and mouths were taped. They were told to lie on the floor face down with one of 
the suspects standing guard over them with a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Chin -- with a pistol pointed to the back of his head -- led the suspects to 
the company's inventory. No one was injured, but $500,000 worth of microchips 
were taken, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the chips were subsequently recovered by police inside a Santa 
Ana residence. Police arrested three men -- An Dinh Le, 26, and Vu Van Pham, 
24, both of Santa Ana, and Benedi Pabillore, 23, of Downey -- on suspicion of 
possessing stolen property. They were released pending further investigation, 
and police have not charged the men with any crime including gang-related 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Express Management, police said at least eight other companies in 
California were robbed by Vietnamese gangs in the last year, including the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
* ISIS Surface Mounting Inc. in San Jose, Aug. 31. Two Vietnamese suspects with 
semiautomatic pistols tied up two employees and escaped with $400,000 worth of 
microchips. 
</P>
<P>
* Vantronic Corp. in San Jose, April 28. Three Vietnamese suspects told 
late-shift employees to lie face down on the ground or be shot. They made off 
with $100,000 worth of microchips. 
</P>
<P>
* Telecomputer Inc. in Westminster, March 31. A Vietnamese suspect and a 
Cambodian suspect tied up an employee and stole $100,000 in microchips. 
</P>
<P>
* Data Technology Corp. in Santa Clara, Dec. 30. Four Vietnamese suspects 
commandeered an employee's vehicle and forced him back into the company, where 
they stole about $126,000 worth of computer equipment, mostly microchips. 
</P>
<P>
* W. G. Holt Inc. in Irvine, Nov. 24 -- Thanksgiving Day. Two Vietnamese 
suspects tied up a security guard and took $150,000 worth of microchips. 
</P>
<P>
Police detectives in Southern California and the Silicon Valley recently found 
evidence that the Vietnamese crime rings sometimes work together, trafficking 
stolen chips -- sometimes known as semiconductors or integrated circuits -- 
from Northern California through Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The first link between the gangs was established after an investigation into a 
murder at a San Jose restaurant Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect -- later charged with murder -- was one of several San Jose 
residents who ate dinner at the Tu Do restaurant the same night with a group of 
men from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Police were certain the reason for the murder was simply the result of a fight 
with a diner at a nearby table. But they continued to interview witnesses 
anyway as bits and pieces of that night's table talk leaked out. Before long, 
investigators had pieced together a connection between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of their meeting at that restaurant was to discuss the sale of 
stolen integrated circuits," said San Jose Police Detective Walt Robinson. 
"Stolen integrated circuits from San Jose are being negotiated and sold off to 
a group in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The man charged with murder even had a stash of chips in his car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later on April 25, a similar murder occurred at the Phu Khanh 
restaurant in Garden Grove around 10:30 p.m. Garden Grove Police Detective Ron 
Shave is trying to find Hung Tien Tran, a Vietnamese man charged with murder 
who has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Shave said police have evidence to indicate that Tran is dealing in stolen 
microchips. "And we know that one of Hung's (Tran's) acquaintances was also at 
the San Jose murder," Shave said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the links, police admit they are still a long way from cracking any of 
the robbery rings largely because members can hide in the closed-mouthed 
Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to infiltrate it," said Lt. Mike White of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, many law enforcement officials concede that gangs are probably 
responsible for at least a part of the burglaries, some of which are just as 
well thought out as armed robberies but occur at times when companies are 
completely empty of employees. 
</P>
<P>
Burglars stole $176,000 worth of computer equipment -- mostly microchips -- 
from Unitex Inc. in Tustin over the July 4 weekend, police and company 
officials said. The company's alarm system never rang through to the local 
police station because the phone lines it needs to work were severed. 
</P>
<P>
"They cut the phone lines into our complex, pried our door open and came in and 
just cleaned us out," said Don Smith Jr., the company's manager. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Police Lt. H.D. Williams says his investigation of the incident is "dead 
in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the modus operandi in the Unitex burglary is rather common. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are so sophisticated that in many of the instances they are 
actually defeating the alarm system," said Roberts. "On one occasion they came 
prepared enough to where they brought a saw to actually cut through a metal 
door." 
</P>
<P>
But some chip burglaries are committed by small-time operators rather than 
Vietnamese gangs. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, on Aug. 3, 27-year-old Johnny Charles Gallo showed up in a United 
Parcel Service uniform at Toshiba America Electronic Components Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up to the loading dock, identifies himself as a UPS driver and 
attempts to take possession of electronic components," said White. 
</P>
<P>
The employees called police. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a little suspicious when they didn't see the (UPS) truck," explained 
White. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Gallo after they found microchips inside a Ryder rental truck 
he was driving. Schweber Electronics in Irvine claimed the chips inside Gallo's 
truck were stolen from them a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Gallo pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to 240 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Besides battling armed robberies and burglaries, computer firms are desperately 
trying to put down a series of microchip thefts by their own employees. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital has caught workers trying to take home 100 to 200 chips. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of money for some guy making $4, $5, $6 an hour," said Bowman of 
the Irvine police department. 
</P>
<P>
AST Research Inc. in Irvine discovered late last year that some workers in its 
order department were creating phony invoices and then sending chips to 
addresses where they could later pick them up, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
The company estimated it lost $184,000 as a result of the scheme. No arrests 
have been made, but the case is still under investigation, Irvine police said. 
</P>
<P>
Some police are convinced that some electronics shops in the Little Saigon area 
of Orange County are the primary buyers and sellers of hot chips. 
</P>
<P>
"You can pick any shop in the area which sells loose chips and chances are they 
are selling stolen chips. It's that prevalent," said Westminster Police 
Detective Marcus Frank. "We know a lot of the chips stolen in Orange County and 
California are being brought into this area to be resold.' 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police recovered $5,000 worth of stolen chips in April from an 
electronics company called AQA Inc., which recently moved to Cypress. The chips 
were taken from a Houston firm, which recognized them in an advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
AQA manager Conn Wong refused to comment on the advice of his attorney but one 
of his employees said the company did not know the chips were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Convicting a store owner selling stolen chips is nearly impossible because 
state law requires he must have knowingly purchased hot property. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are smart and they know that if somebody comes in and says 'I just 
stole this' then they probably won't buy it," said White. "And that's what we 
need to do to make arrests." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign traffic in stolen chips is believed to be considerable because of the 
number of computer manufacturers in the Pacific Rim clamoring for chips. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital discovered that 500,000 defective chips had been stolen from 
its inventory and that some of them were on their way to Taiwan. Fearing that 
if the bad chips were sold it would damage the firm's reputation, Western 
Digital tried to buy them back for $11 a chip. Somebody else got them for $12. 
</P>
<P>
The international black market for stolen chips is perhaps the most troubling 
aspect for many companies. The U.S. government strictly forbids sales of 
microchips to certain countries and any violations are dealt with severely. 
</P>
<P>
Private consultants and local police stress that computer companies need to 
improve security in order to prevent further thefts. 
</P>
<P>
"The electronics industry is such an easy target," said Roberts. "It's easier 
than a bank, it's easier than an armored car, it's easier than a jewelry 
store." 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have heeded the warnings. ICL North America in Irvine recently 
installed security cameras and started an anonymous hot line for employees to 
report internal thefts. 
</P>
<P>
But few companies are eager to go much further, refusing to consider such 
things as searching employees when they leave work. 
</P>
<P>
Police and industry leaders meet regularly in the San Jose area to discuss 
strategies to reduce microchip thefts under the auspices of the District 
Attorneys Technology Theft Assn. Southern California does not have anything 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be a concentrated effort by the electronics industry and law 
enforcement," said Roberts. "Until that's done, I don't see any resolution of 
the problem."

TONS OF FOOD ROTTING AT PORTS, SOVIETS ARE TOLD 
</P>

<P>
Tens of thousands of tons of food purchased abroad to try to make up for 
consumer shortages are rotting at ports throughout the country because of the 
breakdown of the Soviet distribution system, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov 
said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast on Soviet television, Ryzhkov blamed mismanagement and 
warned: "If things do not improve shortly, we'll have to take tough measures 
against leaders of all ranks." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov's candid speech went to the heart of the problem that analysts say 
presents the most serious threat to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- 
continuing and worsening shortages in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet authorities have discussed failures in the country's 
transportation system, Ryzhkov's televised comments marked a rare 
acknowledgement from a senior official of the loss of goods purchased abroad by 
the Soviet Union with foreign currency, which is especially valuable in this 
country where the ruble is not convertible on the world's currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the happiest day of my life when we stop purchasing food abroad," 
Ryzhkov said. But he said that as long as the Soviet Union is spending money to 
buy food from abroad, if it rots before reaching the stores, someone should be 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted in an indirect way that 70% of the country is 
suffering from serious food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"In about 30% of our country, the food supply situation is not bad," Ryzhkov 
said. "I don't say everything is fine, but the needs of the local population 
are satisfied in those cases in terms of food production." 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that 1990 will be a crucial year for Gorbachev's policy 
of perestroika, or restructuring, and that the government considers it 
imperative that consumers see improvements by then. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the illness which is now plaguing the economy can be 
cured," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov noted that the traditional manner of dealing with chronic food 
shortages in the Soviet Union -- by increasing agricultural output -- is no 
longer enough. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the country must "improve the system of storing, transporting 
and processing food." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, he said, the country is increasing by about 20% the number of 
factories that will handle food processing, such as canning. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem of transportation remains. The official Tass news agency 
reported this week that 29 million tons of grain, 1 million tons of meat and 
25% of the country's vegetables are lost each year between field and table. 
</P>
<P>
The problems with transporting food in the Soviet Union are caused primarily by 
two things: a shortage of spare parts for vehicles and a lack of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported Sunday that 1,700 trains are stalled in the country for lack of 
coal. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the evening news program "Vremya" said that 300 
containers are stacked in a rail depot in the Vladimir region awaiting shipment 
to other parts of the country. The deliveries have been stalled because of the 
large number of trucks waiting to be repaired and a shortage of spare parts, 
Vremya said. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the country's various transportation problems, said Ryzhkov, is 
that 25,000 tons of food and several thousand tons of detergent, in short 
supply for months in most parts of the country, are waiting at ports and depots 
for delivery to stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is rotting," the prime minister said. "The average person doesn't 
understand why this is going on, and why no one is being punished." 
</P>
<P>
He cited another example, saying that the Soviet Union signed a contract with 
Czechoslovakia to buy 1 million pairs of shoes but had to renege on the 
agreement after it found it was unable to pick up the shoes and bring them to 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet newspaper Trud (Labor), said one sugar processing plant in the 
Ukraine has been closed and up to 30 more in the republic may be shut down -- 
at the height of the sugar beet harvest -- because no steps are being taken to 
ensure the transportation of the sugar to markets outside The republic.

ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND DEMOCRATIC REFORMS HAVE DONE LITTLE TO BREAK MEN'S

<P>
After centuries of abuse and discrimination, South Korean women decided to draw 
the line last year when a homemaker was convicted of assault for biting off 
part of the tongue of a man attempting, with an accomplice, to rape her in an 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
A district court in provincial Taegu gave the woman a six-month suspended 
prison sentence for using "excessive self-defense" against her two attackers. 
The male judge reasoned that in the end, she only had lost a kiss, while one of 
the men had lost a third of his tongue. The court also handed down suspended 
jail terms for the would-be rapists. 
</P>
<P>
Astonished and enraged, a hodgepodge of radical and conservative women's groups 
banded together to fight the chauvinism behind the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
With legal backing from the feminist coalition and moral support from a 
sympathetic husband, Mrs. Pyon, as she is identified in the local press, 
established her innocence on appeal. Prosecutors still advanced the case to the 
Supreme Court, which issued a ruling exonerating Pyon in August. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the battle of the sexes is far from finished in South Korea. Critics say 
the kind of mentality that resulted in Pyon's public humiliation remains 
stubbornly entrenched in society, despite nominal gains for women amid the 
recent whirl of economic advancement and democratization. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of controversy is the Family Law, which institutionalizes Korea's own 
brand of Confucian ethics, a rigid tradition of male ancestor worship that was 
imported from China in antiquity but survives here as nowhere else. Under the 
law, members of the same clan are forbidden to marry each other no matter how 
remote their blood ties. Women are denied the right to become head of their 
households, a condition with profound implications for divorce, child custody 
and communal property ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the gap between the sexes widening rather than closing," said Lee Kyung 
Ja, a fiction writer and outspoken advocate of sexual equality. "I'm trying to 
show people that the problem is in the structure of society and in institutions 
that hate women." 
</P>
<P>
In a promising sign of relaxing attitudes, Lee's collection of short stories 
dealing with the problems of contemporary women, "Half Failure," was dramatized 
last month on prime-time television. Some of her extreme polemic was weeded out 
of the screenplay, but Lee said there has been an outpouring of viewer 
response. Both wives and mothers-in-law told her they wept over a segment on 
their primordial family conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, they have different reasons for crying," Lee said, referring to the 
typical mother-in-law's habit of advocating a son's male prerogatives. "I was 
hoping they would cry together." 
</P>
<P>
Men, meanwhile, are not standing by idly while their value system comes under 
attack. Although women have been trying to revise the Family Law since 1975, 
they have made no discernible progress. Recent proposals to take action on the 
issue in the National Assembly have prompted mass rallies by the nation's 
Confucianist lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the common belief, women are not discriminated against in South 
Korea," said Kang Jung Hee, chairman of the traditional learning committee of 
the National Institute of Confucian Studies. "Not only do they have equal 
rights, it's the men who are dominated." 
</P>
<P>
Kang, an elderly scholar who works out of a ramshackle pagoda-style building on 
the campus of Sung Kyun Kwan University, had some difficulty citing examples of 
how South Korean men have been oppressed by their women. During the Yi Dynasty 
(1392-1910), he noted, men did backbreaking agricultural labor while their 
wives relaxed at home. He only smiled when it was pointed out that today, women 
frequently do the lion's share of farm work. 
</P>
<P>
Confucianists do not oppose women joining -- or rising in -- the work force or 
participating in politics, Kang said. But they fear the "erosion of traditional 
morals" symbolized by the effort to revise the Family Law. The principle that 
only a man can be the head of any household must be immutable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not discriminating against women here," Kang said. "We just favor the 
man because he's more active in society and better able to serve as the master 
of the house." 
</P>
<P>
What has resulted is a milieu in which a widow's son becomes her master, or, if 
she has only daughters, a paternal in-law takes charge of her legal affairs. 
Divorced women can and often do reside with their children, but the ex-husband 
maintains legal custody through the official family register. Assets and real 
estate, technically, belong only to the male head of the house, and divorce 
courts tend to favor the men. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Confucian scheme, fathers transmit family honor and ancestral virtue to 
their sons through an unbroken line of male-linked kin," Laurel Kendall, an 
anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, wrote last year in a 
monograph that pondered the "moral inferiority" of Korean women. 
</P>
<P>
"Sons repay their debt of gratitude through filial piety; sons accept the 
father's authority for the sake of family welfare and reputation," Kendall 
said. "Sons support aging parents. Sons sustain the living family's link with 
the past through periodic offerings of wine and rice to the family's ancestors, 
and sons sustain the family's links with the future through the provision of 
male heirs." 
</P>
<P>
A Korean woman who fails to produce a healthy son is in a serious predicament. 
In Lee's case, she forced the issue by undergoing a tubal ligation -- without 
her husband's knowledge -- after bearing two daughters. Her husband, a bank 
executive, is the eldest son and heir in his family. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine the pressure," Lee said. "Even if I had seven daughters, I 
could go to a fortune teller and be told I have no children. Daughters don't 
count. Under Korean custom, my husband could drive me from my home and deprive 
me of my status as a wife." 
</P>
<P>
A tragedy last February underscored the depth of the male-superiority ethos. 
Four sisters, ages 6 through 11, took rat poison in a suicide pact, intending 
to lighten the burden on their impoverished family so that their 3-year-old 
brother could receive the best possible education. The youngest sister died. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Koreans are all a little bit insane, especially the females," said 
attorney Kang Gui Won, who until a few years ago was one of only three women 
practicing law in South Korea. "Women live like dogs at home. You can live like 
that for a short period, but after a while you become very sick." 
</P>
<P>
Kang, a conservative former judge who assisted with Pyon's legal appeal in the 
tongue-biting incident, is not related to Kang, the Confucian scholar. 
Nevertheless, had the two been closer in age and chanced to catch each other's 
eye, they most likely would have been forbidden to marry. They share the same 
surname. 
</P>
<P>
That's another tenet that Kang, the Confucianist, insists must be protected at 
all costs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the law is changed, soon we'd be allowing cousins to marry each other -- 
there'd be no control," he said. "Can you imagine having to carry around your 
genealogical records to screen people before falling in love? This isn't just 
custom, it's science." 
</P>
<P>
The present law does not bar distant cousins from marrying if it is their 
mothers, instead of their fathers, who are related. And in fact, the government 
grants occasional amnesties to paternal kinsmen who have been living in sin 
because of the name game. But critics of the law say it lends official credence 
to a stifling social atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"Our men will never understand," said Kim Yung Chung, a second state minister 
for political affairs and the only woman in President Roh Tae Woo's Cabinet. 
"We don't really have racism in Korea -- the only discrimination is by sex. Men 
ridicule us when we bring up the subject of affirmative action or revising the 
Family Law. They laugh it off." 
</P>
<P>
Kim, a former history professor at Ewha University, a prestigious women's 
college, said she still suffers from a double standard in her political career. 
She can't always have a cigarette when the urge arises, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"If I smoked in front of men," she said, "my reputation would be very bad." 
</P>
<P>
While women in nearby Japan are experiencing a surge in political power, 
sparked in part by the charismatic chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, 
Takako Doi, participation of South Korean women in the electoral process 
remains a sad state of affairs. Not a single candidate was successful among the 
14 women running for district seats in April's National Assembly election. The 
six members of the chamber's female caucus were on proportional lists. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean Women's Development Institute recently started a training program 
aimed at preparing candidates for local assembly elections expected sometime 
next year. But at last count, women account for only 1.1% of the country's 
career civil servants, compared to 26.5% in the United States and 6.8% in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In employment, too, the downtrodden women of Japan appear liberated by South 
Korean standards. Women make up about half the work force here, yet they earn 
on the average about 40% what men take home. Women university graduates 
complain they can't find work. Young and dispensable female laborers remain the 
backbone of much of the nation's export-oriented light industry, such as 
textiles and electronics, toiling until they reach marriage age. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, the anthropologist, observed that "an unprecedented number of young 
women began to come to the cities in the late 1960s. Without this pool of 
cheap, educated and initially docile female labor, the Korean economic miracle 
could not have taken place." 
</P>
<P>
An Equal Employment Opportunity Law enacted last April 1, on the eve of the 
National Assembly election, corrected on paper many of the injustices in the 
workplace, but Kim, the Cabinet minister, said the new law is so ideal that it 
is unenforceable. Kang, the attorney, sits on a special committee empowered 
under the law to take appeals in job equality disputes in the Seoul area. No 
cases have come up so far. 
</P>
<P>
"We're watching, but they say they solve all the cases in the workplace," Kang 
said. "We feel women don't come to us for fear they'll lose their jobs if they 
fight against their employers." 
</P>
<P>
A range of grave social problems persist for women. The conventionally timid 
South Korean press, freed from censorship only last year, has published 
disturbing accounts of young women being kidnaped by gangsters and forced into 
prostitution rings, where they remain virtual slaves because social shame 
thwarts their return to home and family. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is so threatening that one married woman, a senior reporter at a 
financial newspaper in Seoul, said she stopped taking walks alone at night. 
</P>
<P>
"The kidnaping cases we hear about are only the tip of the iceberg," said Lee 
Jong Mok, a male official at the International Human Rights League of Korea. "A 
lot of girls don't come forward, because under the Confucian moral code their 
lives are completely destroyed. The problem won't go away until a lot of 
attitudes are changed." 
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence is another menace. Lee Kye Jong, publisher of Women's Weekly, 
a feminist newspaper that sponsors a battered women's hot line, said her staff 
conducted a poll and found that two out of every three homemakers claimed they 
had been beaten at least once by their husbands. The survey suggested that more 
than 40% of the respondents suffered regular physical abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't walk down the street now and see a man without suspecting that he 
beats his wife," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wife beating was one of the taboo topics taken up by Lee Kyung Ja, the feminist 
writer, and she believes the dramatization of her fiction on the 
government-owned Korean Broadcasting System had a "collective catharsis" effect 
on many ordinary women. 
</P>
<P>
"Television dramas portraying women have been so isolated and out of touch with 
reality that viewers thought they were about other people's lives. But women 
have been calling me asking how I learned about their families, their own 
stories," Lee said. "The men, on the other hand, are feeling a little 
uncomfortable. My husband was blushing when he watched."

NOW WHAT, AFTER DRUG SCANDAL AND BIG BUST?; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: RETRENCHMENT IS THE WATCHWORD ON ONE FRONT OF THE LOS 
ANGELES-AREA DRUG WARS, BUT FEDERAL ASSET-SEIZURE LAWS PROVIDE INCENTIVE FOR 
CONTINUED POLICE COOPERATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TRAFFICKERS.

<P>
With a record bust and growing scandal, it has hardly been a routine time on 
the front lines of the Los Angeles drug wars. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of 21 tons of cocaine in Sylmar and suspension of 18 sheriff's 
investigators have focused very different sorts of attention on the police 
units that match wits with major drug traffickers, prompting a re-evaluation by 
some, gloating by others and -- inevitably in the society of cops -- some 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
In Brea, officials have reigned in their roving four-officer drug squad, one of 
the glitzy units that popped up in recent years to take advantage of 
asset-seizure laws. The problem? They spent much of their time backing up a 
Sheriff's Department team that now is suspected of skimming off cocaine cash. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to doing pretty much local stuff," said Brea Capt. Jim Oman. "We're 
kind of catching our breath and seeing what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
But retrenchment is hardly the mood at the Quad City Task Force, made up of 
officers from four police departments in southeast Los Angeles County. After 
long doing the anonymous grunt work of investigations, task force members 
pulled off the World's Largest Drug Bust. 
</P>
<P>
So, "Now that we're kind of on the map," as Sgt. Ralph Freeze put it, they've 
given themselves a new job -- they want to rename their unit. 
</P>
<P>
Brea police were among the first in Southern California to recognize the 
potential of the 1984 federal law that enabled local police to claim as much as 
90% of the cash and other assets they confiscate in criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
That year, they formed a "special enforcement division" and one of the officers 
began using a seized red Corvette to help him infiltrate drug rings throughout 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brea is in Orange County, the unit often worked with a Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department drug squad based in Whittier. It was a type of 
cooperative effort that grew common as narcotics trafficking in the area 
broadened, with suspects stashing their drugs and money in several communities 
and frequently moving around. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of big cases (alone), but 90% of the stuff we were doing was 
backup," Capt. Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
His officers helped on tedious stakeouts and followed suspects, whether they 
headed for the San Fernando Valley or Las Vegas. "They got on the road and 
never knew where they were going," Oman said. 
</P>
<P>
The efforts paid off. The city now is waiting for its share of $4 million the 
unit helped seize. 
</P>
<P>
But when Sheriff Sherman Block announced Sept. 1 that his drug squad was being 
disbanded, after a "sting" in which deputies were said to have been videotaped 
diverting cash, the news had added impact in Brea. The Brea crew had been 
backing up Block's squad at the raid at the Valley Hilton in Sherman Oaks that 
turned out to be a setup by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Oman said he and Police Chief Donald L. Forkus questioned their officers and 
were satisfied they had been isolated from any wrongdoing. But "most of our 
people were very shook up how this could have happened literally under their 
nose," he said. They decided to scale back. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Mayor Gene Leyton said the decision was made by police alone. He added: 
"As a city, we're not trying to become the narcotics enforcement agency for 
Southern California. . . . We don't want them working in San Diego or Santa 
Barbara unless it has some relativity to us." 
</P>
<P>
Oman sees it as necessary, but unfortunate in a way. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend on these cases, they seem to be getting bigger and bigger quantities 
of the drugs and it takes some cooperation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like this, suspicions of theft . . . this sets the whole thing 
back." 
</P>
<P>
When police from Maywood, Bell-Cudahy and Huntington Park formed a joint drug 
squad last year, they named it the Tri Cities Task Force. South Gate joined in 
this year, and they changed the name to Quad Cities. 
</P>
<P>
But when four leaders of the team gathered late last week at the Huntington 
Park Police Station, Sgt. Andy Key of South Gate argued that they now needed a 
new name "without a numerical." That way, it would stick even if one city drops 
out, or another joins the force. 
</P>
<P>
"SEANET," he proposed. "The Southeast Area Narcotics Enforcement Team." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Bill Huffman of Huntington Park wasn't sure. "It's going to be hard 
to break the habit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities originally formed the squad for a couple of reasons. Their police 
departments are relatively small -- Maywood has only 25 sworn officers -- and 
the few officers each assigned to drug enforcement found it impossible to dent 
even the local problems working alone. In addition, they couldn't help but 
notice how other departments, such as Brea's, were adding small fortunes to 
their coffers by going after "major violators." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 officers eventually assembled in the Quad Cities Task Force still had to 
handle "street dope" cases, periodically arresting pushers at the corner parks 
or raiding rock houses. But they also agreed to help U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents who were investigating trucks suspected of carrying 
drugs. The Southeast Los Angeles area was a natural focal point with its 
freeways, industrial areas and truck stops. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the detectives found themselves on six-day stakeouts, sitting in cars 
eating junk food and reading the same newspaper over and over. Freeze, who is 
from Bell, celebrated his birthday in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
One stakeout helped Orange County authorities seize 300 kilograms of cocaine, 
and another 249 kilogram seizure followed. The results all went "on the board," 
a blackboard where they tallied arrests, money and drug seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Relations were good with the DEA agents, all agreed. "At no point did they say, 
'OK, we'll work it alone from here,' " Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
But there was some conflict with Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates after 
one of their surveillance operations, prompted by a tip to a federal agent, led 
to the discovery of $12.2 million in cash and truckloads of cocaine in the 
Sylmar warehouse on Sept. 28. Police chiefs from the four cities grew furious 
when they perceived the glory going to Gates and his officers, who were called 
in to assist only at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of their meeting in Huntington Park, however, the task force 
members were no longer worried about "the little guy" being overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Freeze announced that a local elementary school was honoring his officers that 
afternoon. And plans were being made for all the cities to throw a big party 
for task force members and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," mused Key, "there could have been no money at that warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
"And no one would have heard of it," said Freeze. 
</P>
<P>
A belt beeper went off. The DEA was summoning. Huffman left to phone, then 
returned with the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone want to go to El Paso on Monday?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
In few places is there as much sympathy for what the Sheriff's Department is 
going through as at the Los Angeles offices of the DEA. Last year, three former 
agents were indicted for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and heroin. A 
$3-million bank account belonging to one of them recently was seized by 
authorities in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
When the sheriff's suspensions were announced, the special agent in charge of 
the DEA office, John M. Zienter, called Block to commiserate. "They went bad, 
the agency didn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was our turn at bat," said one agent. "Now the sheriff is at bat. 
Next year it will be someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such somber reflection, there is room for a bit of humor, even about 
such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Maywood Police Chief Ted Heidke recalled how he rushed to the Sylmar warehouse 
in the middle of the night after the Quad Cities crew called him about the raid 
there, then found himself "standing in the corner, where there's all this 
money. Bundle after bundle of $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at one of the guys next to me and I said, 'Check me out a 
million and a half,' and I picked up one of the bundles. And he said, 'No, no. 
That one's mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, two sheriff's deputies joked quite differently last week 
about their roles on a task force in which they work beside DEA agents and 
other Los Angeles-area narcotics detectives. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't touch the money," said Deputy Randy Petee, holding up his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We see money," added Deputy Larry Swanson, "and we run."

EAST GERMANS TO RALLY TODAY IN LEIPZIG; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: A SHOWDOWN ON REFORMS MAY COME AT A CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING LATER 
THIS WEEK.

Pro-democracy activists in the East German city of Leipzig said Sunday they 
will go ahead with a planned demonstration today as the country's mushrooming 
opposition group, New Forum, held a major meeting in East Berlin despite the 
Communist regime's refusal to recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
The Leipzig activists told journalists in East Berlin that demonstrations will 
be held despite the condemnation of street protests by the Communist Party's 
ruling Politburo. Last Monday, more than 50,000 took part in a pro-democracy 
march in Leipzig in one of the largest protests of its kind in the 40-year 
history of the Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
The latest developments came amid continuing reports that East German leaders 
had not decided how to resolve the refugee crisis and that ailing leader Erich 
Honecker, 77, might step down. 
</P>
<P>
The West German newspaper Bild, quoting unidentified sources in East Berlin, 
said a showdown may come at a meeting of the party's 163-member Central 
Committee on Thursday or Friday. The Politburo is due to meet Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, reputed to have an extensive network of reliable sources in East 
Germany, reported that about 20,000 people have resigned from the party in the 
growing public resentment over the hard-line regime's refusal to agree to 
meaningful reforms. The party has about 2.2 million members. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of the New Forum in East Berlin, 150 senior members of the 
loosely knit organization -- which claims to have at least 25,000 members -- 
signed up for its program calling for political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Baerbel Bohley, one of New Forum's founders, said that members from 14 
different East German areas met in the city to talk about a firmer direction 
for the movement. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, some East German officials have made muted calls for a more 
open society, but Bohley said in an interview Sunday that she remains skeptical 
of the aging leadership's ability to change. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are really reformist forces in the leadership, why have they not come 
out of the woodwork before?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
During the last three weeks, New Forum has been in the vanguard of elements 
demanding a greater voice for all members of East German society in government 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Bohley, a graphics artist, and others who helped found the movement have 
stressed its nonviolent nature and emphasized that all of its members wish to 
work for reform within the socialist state, rather than fleeing the country as 
thousands of others have done in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bohley said New Forum will attempt to publish its own newspaper and will apply 
for permission to do so. 
</P>
<P>
New Forum sprouted from nowhere four weeks ago and is now the major national 
protest group, although the Protestant church has served as the local focus for 
meetings urging reforms in various cities. 
</P>
<P>
The government appears at odds with itself over whether to crack down on New 
Forum's meetings and declarations or to allow the movement a certain voice, 
through which the beleaguered society could let off steam. 
</P>
<P>
New Forum members reported that the mayor of Karl Marx Stadt has offered to 
meet with various individual members of the group but not with the organization 
as such. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be spoken to as Herr Mayer or Herr Mueller," said Bohley, 
"but as New Forum. There should be real dialogue, not a monologue disguised as 
a dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flight of the more than 50,000 East Germans in the last month 
could cost the country millions of dollars in lost income, a leading East 
German academic said in a statement released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Communist Party newspaper of the southern city of Halle, Prof. 
Peter Thal declared: 
</P>
<P>
"When people of an active working age leave our country, there is a compelling 
economic logic, namely that the production of national income is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
"Put clearly, for every 10,000 workers, about a third of a billion marks ($180 
million) is created in national income in our country each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Seen over the long term (30 additional working years), it comes to quite a 
pretty sum -- a reduction of our national income, per 10,000 active workers, of 
10 billion marks, believe it or not." 
</P>
<P>
Thal, head of the Halle-Wittenberg University's law and economics faculty, said 
his figures do not include lost investment on education and career training. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the objections (to the methods of calculation)," he said, "the damage 
to our country is indisputable."

THORNBURGH TO 'NUDGE' SOVIET REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL INVITES THE KREMLIN TO 'PICK AND 
CHOOSE' FROM THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM IN REVAMPING ITS OWN.

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, making the first visit to the Soviet Union by an 
American attorney general in his official capacity, said Sunday that he views 
his five-day mission as an "opportunity to give a gentle nudge" to the Soviet 
leadership to maintain the "right direction" in restructuring their society. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing Soviet perestroika (restructuring) as "a time of remarkable change 
and fluidity," Thornburgh in an interview said its prospects for making 
permanent change hinge largely on achieving what Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev calls a law-based society. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to help the Soviets in their effort to adopt the rule of law, 
Thornburgh and a team of Justice Department officials are meeting with top 
legal officials here, offering them the opportunity to "pick and choose" from 
the U.S. system. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our opportunity," he said, noting that the Soviets "have reached out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be teaching or preaching -- merely sharing thoughts on our 
system, their system, where we go from here," he said of the visit, which is 
being made in response to an invitation from Soviet Justice Minister Veniamin 
Yakovlev. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a great interest in many elements of our system -- Article I of our 
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, subsequent amendments, except perhaps 
Prohibition, although they have some problems there," Thornburgh said. "It's a 
model they have to examine, because all of these provisions address problems 
with counterparts in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
While he is the latest in a series of ranking U.S. officials to visit the 
Soviet Union, as attorney general, Thornburgh faces significant crime problems 
at home, chief among them carrying out the war on illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But Thornburgh contended that trying to help the Soviets "reform areas 
previously off-limits" to any change is just as important as his domestic 
mission. The changes "spell only good for the United States," he said. "A root 
of a lot of our (U.S.-Soviet) tension has been our feeling about the oppressive 
nature of the Soviet system, its aggressive foreign policy in the past, 
resulting partly from a lack of accountability of its leadership to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"The change of direction (by the Soviet government) has to be all positive for 
the United States, world peace and human rights," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
While carrying a paperback copy of the Federalist Papers in his briefcase and 
noting that the Soviet leadership "is obviously grappling with tensions in 
their republics," Thornburgh said: "We don't necessarily suggest they adopt our 
form of federal government. But there are certainly lessons to be learned." 
</P>
<P>
He said that such U.S. legal guarantees as freedom of speech, due process of 
law and the rights of criminal defendants add up to "an appropriate menu from 
which wise Soviet leaders can borrow." 
</P>
<P>
After meeting today with Yakovlev, Procurator General Alexander Y. Sukharev and 
Minister of Internal Affairs Vadim V. Bakatin, the Americans and their Soviet 
counterparts will turn to "nuts and bolts matters," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
These include battling narcotics trafficking, organized crime and environmental 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Lawn, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will join the group 
for the narcotics discussion. 
</P>
<P>
In what some U.S. officials compare to the American surge of marijuana use 
during the Vietnam War, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan seemed to have led 
to the increased use of heroin, hashish and marijuana here. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is not a narcotics transshipping country or a source of 
illicit drugs consumed in the United States, but this should not prevent "us 
from extending a helping hand" to Soviet efforts to counter drugs, Thornburgh 
said. The DEA is already training some Soviet narcotics agents in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh also will be meeting with Soviet immigration officials, prospective 
Soviet refugees to the United States and some Jewish-American group 
representatives over the ticklish issue of emigration under the new Soviet 
policy of allowing thousands to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said he did not feel uneasy about meeting with top Soviet legal 
officials even though he oversees the FBI and its counterintelligence 
operations as the top U.S. law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. counterintelligence sources have said the Soviet Union has not lessened 
its espionage activities in the United States, and Felix S. Bloch, a veteran 
State Department official, is under intense scrutiny by the FBI, which suspects 
him of turning government material over to a Soviet agent. 
</P>
<P>
The trip marks Thornburgh's second official visit to the Soviet Union. In 1979, 
he came as governor of Pennsylvania in a delegation of governors.

U.S. AIRMAN HELD FOR TALKING TO SOVIETS IN BONN

U.S. authorities in West Berlin said Sunday that they have detained an American 
Air Force man, seized while talking to two Soviet military officers who were 
allegedly trying to obtain information from him. 
</P>
<P>
American officials said the Soviet officers were briefly detained and 
questioned by counterintelligence officers before being handed over to Soviet 
officials in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mission did not identify the detained American serviceman and said 
that any more relevant information would have to come from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Reuters news agency in West Berlin reported that the two Soviet officers 
were identified only as Rokichky and Markov, both majors. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said it was the third case of suspected espionage by U.S. 
military personnel this year in West Berlin, a major center of espionage 
activity between Eastern and Western powers, as well as between East and West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The American mission in West Berlin, a city that retains special status under 
the nominal control of the Allied occupying powers, said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"The two Soviets were apprehended while meeting an airman who had been tasked 
by the Soviets to provide them with classified U.S. defense information. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Air Force member involved is cooperating with U.S. authorities 
regarding the matter." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mission said it has protested verbally to Soviet authorities over the 
incident but has not received an answer. It added that a formal written protest 
will be made today to Soviet authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army has a Berlin infantry brigade of several thousand soldiers, and 
the U.S. Air Force maintains an air base at Tempelhof in West Berlin, where a 
significant number of special communications personnel are assigned.

Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko met Sunday with Angolan rebel leader Jonas 
Savimbi and a senior U.S. envoy in southern France in his most serious bid yet 
to revive a peace accord to end Angola's 14-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Mobutu talked with Savimbi and Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for 
African affairs. Cohen played a key role in talks in Washington earlier this 
month when President Bush persuaded Savimbi to return to the conference table. 
</P>
<P>
A Zairean spokesman described Sunday's meeting as "very delicate." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the crucial issue of what peace formula Savimbi would 
accept as a condition for agreeing to a cease-fire in the war between the 
Luanda government and UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola). 
</P>
<P>
In June, Savimbi attended a summit in Gbadolite, Zaire, at which he met for the 
first time with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. However, Savimbi 
denies that he agreed to go into exile and merge his guerrilla force into the 
Angolan army, as announced after the summit. 
</P>
<P>
UNITA, which is backed by South Africa and the United States, stepped up 
fighting after the cease-fire announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the United States leaned hard on Savimbi to soften his 
stand on the question of exile. If Mobutu is able to put together an agreement, 
African leaders will meet in Libreville, Gabon, this month for the formal 
signing of a cease-fire accord, the Zairean spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha is scheduled to be briefed 
on the talks in a separate meeting with Mobutu, officials said.

SISULU A GUIDING LIGHT TO YOUNG IN EARLY DAYS;

When Walter Sisulu was running the African National Congress offices almost 
single-handedly 40 years ago, young black students would often drift by to 
chat. And he always seemed to have time for them. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't go to Nelson Mandela to just talk. He suffered fools very badly," 
remembers Dr. Nthato Motlana, one of those students and an early member of the 
ANC. "But you could always go to Sisulu and talk about the little things. He 
was a real uncle." 
</P>
<P>
In those days, Sisulu was the ANC. He had encouraged a young Mandela, then 
newly arrived in Johannesburg, to join the organization. He helped Mandela 
enroll in law school, even paying his tuition, and welcomed him into his 
mother's home as a lodger. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu, 77, freed on Sunday after spending the last 26 years in prison, was the 
most effective grass-roots organizer of the ANC and, with Mandela and Oliver 
Tambo, guided that organization away from its historic reliance on petitioning 
the white government for black rights into an era of civil disobedience and 
armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lovely man, jovial and easygoing," said Amina Cachalia, who fondly 
remembers Sisulu's many visits to her home and that of her husband, Yusuf. "I 
never heard Walter raise his voice or get cross. He was always calm and 
level-headed. And always persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
One of his closest friends in those days was Mandela, who had risen to the 
forefront of the anti-apartheid fight by the early 1960s, and that bond grew 
stronger during their years together, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
Many former prisoners remember receiving visits from Mandela and Sisulu, and 
the two trained several generations of ANC leaders at Robben Island and 
Pollsmoor prisons in Cape Town. While Mandela was clearly the leader, Sisulu 
was regarded as the thinker and philosophizer of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
But the two men came from sharply different backgrounds. While Mandela was the 
son of a tribal chief, Sisulu was the son of a black maid. His father, a white 
construction worker, had left the family when Sisulu was young. At the age of 
15, he was called on to support his mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
Although he would have been classified Colored (mixed-race) under South 
Africa's race classification laws, he chose to be considered a black and was 
initiated into the Xhosa tribe. 
</P>
<P>
He worked in the gold mines, as a domestic worker -- and was fired from a job 
in a bakery for organizing a strike to press for higher wages. In his spare 
time, he took high school correspondence courses. He set up a small real estate 
agency in 1940, and joined the ANC. A year later he met Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu had his first run-in with police in the 1940s, when he was imprisoned 
for assaulting a white train conductor who had confiscated a black child's 
season ticket. 
</P>
<P>
He, Mandela and Tambo, now leader of the ANC in exile, formed the ANC Youth 
League, which eventually took control of the ANC and made Sisulu the secretary 
general from 1949 to 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Although an early proponent of racial exclusiveness, he became one of the 
leading forces in bridging the gap between the ANC and anti-apartheid activists 
of other races. Sisulu and Cachalia, then a leading figure in the Transvaal 
Indian Congress, organized the Defiance Campaign of 1952. Sisulu kicked it off 
by leading activists into a Johannesburg suburb without a permit. Within 
months, 8,500 people had been arrested for taking part in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu left the country secretly in 1953 to seek support for the ANC. Upon his 
return, he was banned by the government, but he continued working for the rebel 
underground. After the government banned the ANC in 1960, Sisulu was detained, 
released and placed under house arrest numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, he was convicted of furthering the aims of the ANC and placed under 
24-hour house arrest while awaiting his appeal. But he escaped and joined the 
high command of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the 
Nation. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu and other ANC leaders were arrested in a 1963 police raid on a farm in a 
Johannesburg suburb. Along with Mandela and eight others, he was convicted of 
plotting sabotage and sentenced to life in prison. Since then, Mandela and 
Sisulu have been considered the most important leaders in the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
The Sisulus are one of the most prominent anti-apartheid families in South 
African history. Walter's wife, Albertina, 71, a nurse, has been repeatedly 
arrested, detained and banned during their 35 years of marriage. They have 
seven children, two of them adopted, and 20 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The Sisulus' 38-year-old son, Zwelakhe, editor of the New Nation newspaper, 
emerged from two years' detention last year and has been placed under severe 
restrictions that prevent him from, among other things, leaving home at night 
or writing articles for publication. 
</P>
<P>
While in prison, Sisulu was a man without pretense. Small and thin, with heavy 
black-rimmed glasses, he cared little about his dress, wearing his prison-issue 
sweater until fellow inmates changed it for him, former prisoner Thami 
Mkhwanazi wrote recently in the Weekly Mail. 
</P>
<P>
Sisulu loves classical and choral music as well as films and board games. He is 
an avid Scrabble player, and prisoners came to his cell after lunch each day to 
play and watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most prized possessions was his dictionary, which he regularly 
loaned to the players. "Half the pages were loose, and he would rearrange the 
pages after the game at the end of the day," Mkhwanazi remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Mkhwanazi says Sisulu is a walking encyclopedia of the ANC, and like many of 
its leaders, Sisulu would occasionally compile political essays or teach 
inmates the history and political ideology of the black liberation struggle. 
Sisulu also is studying for a bachelor's degree in anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in recent years that Sisulu and Mandela were allowed regular 
visitors. Nevertheless, most of Sisulu's friends outside prison were denied 
permission to see him. Until Sunday, the closest contact they had were the 
messages Sisulu passed to them through his wife -- and an artist's rendering of 
a younger Sisulu that hangs prominently in the living room of his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress, the oldest surviving black political 
organization in South Africa, was founded in 1912 as the South African Native 
National Congress. The group took its current name in 1923. Initially a 
moderate, even conservative organization, it opted for armed struggle against 
the South African government after it was banned in 1960. Its president, Oliver 
Tambo, heads an external wing operating from Zambia, while its president for 
life, Nelson R. Mandela, remains imprisoned for life after being convicted of 
sabotage.

<P>
BUDGET: CONGRESS IS CUTTING THE DEFICIT WITH SLEIGHT-OF-HAND MANEUVERS IN ORDER 
TO APPEAR TO BE COMPLYING WITH THE STATUTE'S STRINGENT TARGETS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember only four years ago when Congress and the White House, with much 
breast-beating and self-congratulation, solemnly approved the Gramm-Rudman law 
and promised to close the massive budget deficits by 1991? 
</P>
<P>
They wish you wouldn't. That's because lawmakers, with the complicity of both 
the Ronald Reagan and Bush administrations, have spent most of the time since 
1985 engaging in a fiscal shell game designed to evade Gramm-Rudman's porous 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Through a host of one-time savings and other budgetary gimmicks, politicians 
here have become masters at finding ways of claiming to meet the supposedly 
stringent targets of the law while actually allowing federal borrowing to go 
unchecked. But by appearing to comply with the law, Congress and the White 
House have deflected complaints about their failure to narrow the budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of using Gramm-Rudman as a sword," said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S. 
C.), a co-sponsor of the original budget measure, "we're using it as a shield 
to hide behind." 
</P>
<P>
Gramm-Rudman's ultimate weapon is scheduled to be rolled out today. Because 
Congress has failed to approve legislation to bring the fiscal 1990 deficit 
down to the Gramm-Rudman target, automatic spending cuts of more than $16 
billion will go into effect, hacking equal slices from nearly all government 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of indiscriminate spending cuts -- the budgetary equivalent of 
"Nightmare on Elm Street" -- was supposed to scare Congress into curbing the 
deficit rationally. That didn't happen this year, in part, because the 
across-the-board cuts look downright benign compared to the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
This year's deficit-reduction bill, which is still wending its way through 
Congress, would impose little more than token spending cuts and revenue 
increases. And, at the same time, it would add several new costly programs and 
tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're about to produce is 'Rosemary's Baby,' " confessed Sen. J. James 
Exon (D-Neb.) after voting in committee for a measure that claimed to save $14 
billion this year but would actually add to the deficit in the long run. "And 
it's not looking any better as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was possible to construct an alternative worse than" the 
automatic cuts, said Carol Cox, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget. "But this year, Congress has managed to do it." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Senate, staring at the monster it was about to create, decided 
instead to approve a bare-bones deficit-cutting measure aimed at simply meeting 
the Gramm-Rudman target. 
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear how the House, which has already passed its own 
kitchen-sink deficit bill that includes a capital gains tax cut, would respond 
to the Senate action. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.), who supported the House's own $11-billion deficit-reduction measure, 
is having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"Shelve this legislation and allow the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts to go into 
effect," he said. "Make them permanent and make them hurt." 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman suggested that the 
Bush Administration favors allowing the automatic cuts to remain in effect. The 
cuts may be "the best available alternative. At least it's real," Darman said 
on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." "I think it would be good if people 
would live with it and say, don't restore the cuts," Darman added. 
</P>
<P>
Don't count on Congress following that advice. For the 1990 fiscal year, which 
began on Oct. 1, the now-revised Gramm-Rudman law calls for a deficit not to 
exceed $100 billion. Lawmakers are still expected to ultimately approve a 
deficit-reduction measure aimed at hitting that target, allowing them to claim 
victory and rescind the automatic cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Once any new deficit measure is approved, though, it will be back to business 
as usual. Many of the new tax breaks and spending initiatives the Senate 
dropped from its version are expected to be revived. 
</P>
<P>
And no one really expects the budget gap, which exceeded $150 billion in the 
fiscal year just ended, to narrow by $50 billion. Under the best of 
circumstances, says the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit is 
likely to surpass $120 billion, and it could easily reach $140 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But as far as Gramm-Rudman is concerned, that won't matter. After Oct. 15 of 
each new fiscal year, Congress and the White House are free to ignore their own 
deficit limits and spend as much as they dare without fear of subjecting the 
government to Gramm-Rudman's automatic spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Never was this more painfully apparent than in September, when Congress was 
completing action on the savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, with the support of the White House, agreed to spend as much as $20 
billion before the 1989 fiscal year ended on Sept. 30. It was a safe course 
because the Gramm-Rudman law had long since lost its power to curb spending in 
fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Congress could not use the same gimmick to shield the other $30 billion in 
S&amp;L bailout costs from the Gramm-Rudman discipline. It needed to spend that 
$30 billion in fiscal years 1990 and 1991, when Gramm-Rudman still applied. 
</P>
<P>
So lawmakers fell back on the baldest gambit of all: They adopted an off-budget 
financing mechanism that exempts the $30 billion from Gramm-Rudman accounting. 
In fact, under its Alice-in-Wonderland rules, this phase of the S&amp;L bailout 
will actually reduce the 1990 deficit by about $13 billion as funds borrowed by 
a specially created outside financing agency flow into the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
In other maneuvers exploiting loopholes in Gramm-Rudman, the Pentagon shifted a 
payday from Oct. 1, the first day of the fiscal year, to Sept. 29, the last 
workday in fiscal 1989. Meanwhile, the government speeded up crop-support 
payments to farmers so that they would show up in last year's budget rather 
than the current one. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the sleight-of-hand sliced $4 billion from this year's deficit, while 
adding an equal amount to 1989's -- the one that no longer counts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're becoming more and more addicted to these golden gimmicks," said Sen. 
William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.). They help Congress "meet the technical 
requirements of the budget act without fulfilling the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Gramm-Rudman contend that the law itself is to blame for much of 
Congress' fiscal gamesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"Gramm-Rudman has become counterproductive," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento). "We set up targets we know we can't meet, so the only 
alternative is to find ways to get around them." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, under the existing regime, Matsui points out, legislation is often 
written to avoid any immediate budgetary impact while adding to future 
spending. "Sometimes, in struggling to meet this year's targets, we end up 
making things worse down the road," acknowledged Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N. 
M.), a Gramm-Rudman backer. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), the driving force behind the legislation, defends 
his handiwork and criticizes his colleagues instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Gramm-Rudman-Hollings did not elect this Congress," Gramm said. "I don't think 
we can blame the mechanism. We have to blame ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gramm is planning to propose yet another change in his 
deficit-reduction law, which now calls for a balanced budget in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm and others are proposing to separate Social Security, which is running 
huge annual surpluses, from the rest of the budget as of 1993. Such a move 
would immediately add more than $100 billion to the deficit, though, and so 
Gramm is planning to boost his targets one more time. That would put off the 
supposed rendezvous with a zero deficit until the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the focus of attention in official Washington is on today's deadline 
for the White House to order across-the-board cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the automatic spending cuts went into effect provisionally at the 
start of the fiscal year Oct. 1. But most federal agencies have ignored them so 
far because they are counting on Congress to undo any damage. Even after Bush 
issues an order tonight making them "permanent," there will be almost no 
immediate practical effect. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, more than half of all federal spending, including Social 
Security, food stamps, federal pensions and interest payments is exempt from 
the automatic cuts. Medicare is limited to a maximum cut of 2%, and most of 
that would hit doctors and hospitals rather than the elderly themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of federal spending would be shaved slightly more than $16 billion, 
with equal chunks coming from the defense and non-defense budgets. That spells 
a 4.3% cutback in the defense budget and 5.3% for the rest of the government. 
</P>
<P>
A number of programs, such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and 
subsidies for dairy farmers, face immediate problems because they receive funds 
at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been few shrieks of pain from elsewhere in the vast government 
bureaucracy. Officials can be counted on to juggle funds for weeks to avoid any 
serious impact. 
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) estimated Friday 
that it would take at least 30 to 60 days for the across-the-board spending 
cuts to be felt at all. And once congressional negotiators settle their 
differences over the deficit-reduction legislation, lawmakers are expected to 
repeal the cuts as if they never happened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MISSING THE TARGETS 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 Gramm-Rudman set a series of targets, revised upward in 1987, for the 
federal deficit. The deficit has consistently come in higher.

and a well-known radio announcer in the Southwest, is dead at age 60 of a heart 
attack, a Nosotros spokesman announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Allen Trujillo, current president of the group founded by such film stars 
as Ricardo Montalban and Anthony Quinn in 1970, said Tafoya had died in a 
Pasadena Hospital on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Tafoya began in Albuquerque, N.M., as a radio announcer at the same station 
where his father worked. Called "La Voz Dorada" (the Golden Voice), the younger 
Tafoya moved to Los Angeles to pursue a stage and film career. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years he appeared in "Teahouse of the August Moon," "The Andersonville 
Trial," "They Only Kill Their Masters" and "Mark of Zorro." On TV he had 
featured roles in "Columbo," "Banacek," "Baretta," "Ironside" and many more. 
</P>
<P>
Tafoya, who is survived by his wife, Alicia, a son and a daughter, was a 
founding member of Nosotros, its vice president in 1973 and president from 1974 
to 1975.

Workers at Yosemite National Park will climb high above the floor of Yosemite 
Valley to dismantle a ladder-like system of cables used as a stairway to the 
summit of Half Dome, one of the world's most recognizable rock formations. The 
two shoulder-high cables stretch straight up a cliff near the top of the 
8,842-foot granite dome. The cables are dismantled every fall because it is too 
dangerous for inexperienced hikers to visit the summit during winter.

A group called "Grinch" has started circulating leaflets in the south San 
Francisco Bay Area urging AIDS activists to disrupt the holiday season this 
year in an attempt to draw more attention to the deadly disease. The Gay 
Retaliation for Inexcusable Negligence and Criminal Homophobia is urging 
activists to participate in "Operation Grinch" beginning Nov. 24 by blocking 
traffic, planting stink bombs in department stores, flooding airline 
reservation lines and shutting down automatic bank teller machines.

A customer at a Palo Alto Neiman-Marcus department store slipped a $102,000, 
five-carat diamond ring on his finger and then bolted from the store, fleeing 
in a vehicle driven by another man, police said. The suspect, about 30 to 35 
years old, 200 to 220 pounds with brown hair, walked up to the jewelry counter 
at the swank store in the Stanford Shopping Center and asked to see several 
rings. A store security camera photographed him as he tried on the diamond ring 
and ran out the door.

Most couples trying to conceive through artificial insemination probably should 
give up if the technique has failed after six attempts, researchers said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
A study involving 50 women who underwent in vitro fertilization or IVF at the 
Beth Israel Hospital in Boston found that it was highly unusual for a 
successful pregnancy to occur after the sixth try. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that the overwhelming majority of couples who will achieve 
pregnancy as a result of IVF do so within a relatively short period of time," 
Dr. Machelle Seibel and colleagues wrote in a letter published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Couples who do not achieve a viable pregnancy after four to six IVF cycles 
should be counseled that success with this technique is unlikely and should not 
be encouraged to pursue IVF further," they said.

A chemical that is widely used in fumigating grain and for processing silicon 
in the electronics industry can cause long-lasting chromosomal defects in 
humans exposed to it on the job, researchers reported last week in Science. 
Chromosome defects of the type observed can cause cancer and, in fact, 
epidemiological studies of workers who use the chemical, called phosphine, have 
shown a sharply increased incidence of blood cancers such as non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
The team of researchers, headed by pathologist Vincent F. Garry of the 
University of Minnesota, studied white blood cells obtained from 24 male 
workers who apply fumigants to grain, 20 of whom used phosphine. They found 
visible defects in the 23 pairs of chromosomes that store the genetic blueprint 
of humans in the workers who used phosphines but not in those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
The defects were of two types. Some were short term, persisting for only a few 
days after exposure to the phosphine. Others lasted for at least six months. 
The researchers are now conducting further studies to see if these defects are 
associated with cancer.

HEALTH: A LITTLE-RECOGNIZED PROBLEM IS CONSIDERED A ROADBLOCK TO PROGRESS IN 
DEVELOPING NATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Third World is faced with numerous health and economic problems, but there 
is one little-recognized scourge that represents a significant roadblock to 
future prosperity in Third World countries: intestinal worms. 
</P>
<P>
Diseases caused by parasites are a diverse group ranging from malaria to a 
number of illnesses that are largely unknown in developed countries and which 
require a variety of methods to control. A special category are the intestinal 
parasites, which until recently have received less attention because they have 
been considered to be relatively innocuous. The most common examples are 
hookworm, roundworm and whipworm. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicate that infections by these worms play a much larger role 
in sapping energy and well-being than previously believed. And the studies have 
spurred an increase in drug treatment of the afflictions, an approach that has 
proved highly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps only famine and malaria exceed intestinal worm infections as the 
leading producers of misery and economic loss in the developing world. 
International health experts estimate that the number of individuals infected 
today worldwide probably equals, or may even exceed, the number infected 50 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They say at least one-fourth of the 5 billion people living today have worms, 
often more than one kind. The vast majority are the same individuals in the 
developing world for whom malnutrition is also a primary cause of illness and 
lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps as many as half of all cases of severe child malnutrition . . . are 
precipitated not primarily by the lack of food but by intestinal parasites, 
fever and infection -- especially diarrheal infection -- which depresses the 
appetite, burns the energy and drains away the body weight of the child," 
declares James P. Grant, executive director of the United Nations Children's 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the problem of parasitic diseases in developing countries is 
so serious that neither economic development, population control nor foreign 
aid will suffice to foster prosperity in those countries until the diseases are 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Andrew Davis, director of parasitic diseases for the World Health 
Organization, says: "It is unrealistic to expect rapid advancement in Third 
World countries, which, in addition to their economic misfortunes, are totally 
overburdened with crushing disease problems that diminish output of both 
individuals and communities." 
</P>
<P>
It has been known since the last century that sanitary facilities, clean water 
and personal hygiene are the ways to control intestinal worms. Except for 
pockets of infection due largely to refugee populations, that is why intestinal 
worms are not a major problem in the United States. International aid agencies 
have striven most of this century to improve sanitation and public awareness of 
sanitation's essential role in the Third World by funding water purification 
and latrine-building projects and health education programs. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization currently is winding up a decade-long thrust to 
extend drinking water and sanitation services to hundreds of millions of people 
living in rural and urban slums. While gains have been made and the push will 
continue, UNICEF estimates that 800 million people still will be without access 
to safe water supplies and 1.3 billion will lack adequate sanitation services. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the difficulty of persuading the people to change eons of 
habit by using latrines, which they view as confining and a nuisance to 
maintain. In one Mexican village where health workers finally managed to get 
the residents to use newly installed pit latrines, the cooperation ended 
abruptly when a child fell through the seat opening. 
</P>
<P>
Although a wide selection of anti-worm drugs have been available for some time, 
physicians working in the developing world have been reluctant to use them on a 
wide scale. They believe that the absence of adequate sanitation facilities and 
good hygiene make widespread drug treatment economically useless because 
individuals soon become reinfected. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, there have been signs that the traditional attitude toward 
drug treatment may be changing -- but not without opposition from those who 
fear that treatment may lead to diminished attention to prevention through 
sanitation. In the last several years new studies have indicated that treating 
heavily infected children within a community has health benefits to the whole 
community that may justify the cost -- even though the youngsters subsequently 
do become reinfected. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Michael C. Latham, director of the international nutrition 
program at Cornell University, studies over the last five years are revealing 
that the health consequences of infection in children -- the most vulnerable 
age group -- are far more serious than previously believed. For example, of the 
1 billion people infected with roundworm, about a million acquire intestinal 
obstructions that result in between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths a year, according 
to Latham. 
</P>
<P>
Roundworms, hookworms and whipworms also enhance the debilitating effects of 
malnutrition by causing anemia or decreasing absorption of nutrients or sapping 
the energy that comes from the protein in food, resulting in stunted growth and 
increased vulnerability to other infections. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study conducted in Kenya, Latham and other researchers from the 
Kenya Medical Research Institute and McMaster University in Canada showed that 
treating children with a single dose of an anti-worm drug, albendazole, brought 
highly significant improvements in growth rates over untreated children. The 
drug is seen as valuable because it is effective against each of the life-cycle 
stages of all three kinds of worms. 
</P>
<P>
Treating a few thousand children in a study and getting good results is one 
thing, said Dr. Clive Shiff of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, but 
even for international agencies it's another thing to do it on a global scale. 
"It's ethically needed," he said, "but not affordable." Nevertheless, according 
to Dr. Peter Schantz of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, interest in the 
drug approach is sufficient for CDC to be planning its own field trials to 
verify the positive findings of the Kenya and Montserrat studies.

Small, bulging weak spots in the main blood vessel in the abdomen do not need 
to be routinely repaired in most patients, unlike large weak spots, which are 
in danger of bursting, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery for these common defects, known as abdominal aortic aneurysms, has 
grown dramatically in recent decades and is now performed on about 40,000 
people in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that large aneurysms should be fixed, because they may burst, 
causing catastrophic bleeding and death. But some doubt lingers over whether 
smaller aneurysms must be immediately repaired. 
</P>
<P>
The latest study, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, found that most abdominal 
aortic aneurysms expand slowly, and small ones pose little risk of rupture. 
</P>
<P>
"Our data indicate that all small aneurysms do not need to be routinely 
repaired," said Dr. John W. Hallett Jr., senior author of the study, which was 
published the New England Journal of Medicine.

CNN TAKES ON NETWORKS WITH 'WORLD TODAY';

Call it the CNN paradox: At the hour of day when most TV viewers watch a 
network news broadcast, the one network devoted solely to news has had no 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as it approaches its 10th anniversary, CNN finally has a "flagship" 
broadcast of its own. Starting tonight, CNN will broadcast "The World Today" 
from 6 to 7 p.m. EDT weeknights and for the first time compete directly with 
the nightly news seen on ABC, CBS and NBC (except on the West Coast, where "The 
World Today" will be seen from 3 to 4 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Until now, CNN's strategy has been to counter network news programming by 
offering viewers something different -- most recently a show-business report 
and financial news -- to compete in the East and Midwest against ABC's "World 
News Tonight" with Peter Jennings, "The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather" and 
"NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw. But with 70% of network news viewers 
catching the 6:30 p.m. Eastern broadcasts, it occurred to CNN executives that 
their channel was missing an opportunity to attract people who were accustomed 
to hard news at that hour. 
</P>
<P>
"This is when people go shopping for their news," said Paul Amos, executive 
vice president of news programming for CNN, "and we need to be on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
With its entry into the nightly news war, where star power is deemed a key 
factor, CNN has teamed its most visible newscaster, veteran Bernard Shaw, who 
will anchor from Washington, with newcomer Catherine Crier, who is as fresh a 
face as there is in broadcast journalism -- she's never worked in TV news 
before. Before landing at the anchor desk in CNN's Atlanta headquarters, based 
on her audition for a proposed CNN talk show, Crier was an assistant district 
attorney and then a state district court judge in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the three broadcast networks have talked about expanding their 
half-hour evening newscasts, in part to ease time limitations on reporting as 
well as to add a new dimension to a format that has remained virtually 
unchanged for more than 20 years. But they've been blocked by their affiliated 
stations, which don't want to relinquish even 15 minutes of what is their most 
lucrative local programming time. 
</P>
<P>
Now CNN has beaten them to it, creating considerable interest in "The World 
Today" among TV journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another competitor," says William Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC 
Nightly News." "And we are all curious about how they are going to do it, 
because this would really be the first evening 'news hour.' All of us have 
thoughts on how we would do an hour." 
</P>
<P>
(He and other TV newsmen don't regard PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" the 
same way because, although it too is an hourlong nightly news show, it is 
noncommercial and uses a different format from the traditional network 
newscasts.) 
</P>
<P>
"The World Today," as planned, will be divided into two half hours, the first 
consisting of interviews and in-depth treatment of news and issues; some 
reports might last up to 20 minutes, heretofore virtually unheard of in a 
nightly newscast. The hour's second half will come closer to the traditional 
nightly news format by presenting an overview of the day's important events. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kaczaraba, executive producer of "The World Today," described the program 
as "a little more sophisticated" than CNN's usual broadcasts, which tend toward 
straightforward, unadorned delivery of the news with stories repeated and 
updated frequently. "The World Today" will have its own set and present a 
package of freshly produced reports, which will be updated on subsequent 
broadcasts, most notably "PrimeNews" (5 p.m. PDT) and "CNN Evening News" (7 
p.m. PST). 
</P>
<P>
CNN's decision to go head-to-head with the network newscasts is, by all 
accounts, necessary for the network's growth as an influential news 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"To truly come into their own, they do need a kind of signature broadcast," 
said Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Study at 
Columbia University. The new broadcast, he said, is "a sign of maturation" for 
CNN, which went on the air in June, 1980, as Ted Turner's upstart in the TV 
news business. Today, CNN, which reaches 51 million cable subscribers, is 
regarded as an equal alongside the three network news divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Today" isn't expected to have an immediate effect on the network 
newscasts, each of which, despite a slight decline in audience during the last 
few years, still attract an average of 8.5 million households nightly. In 
contrast, about 500,000 households have been tuning in for CNN's early 
"Newswatch" broadcast and the half-hour "Showbiz Today," which will move to 
2:30 p.m. PDT starting today. "Moneyline" will continue to air at 4 p.m. PDT, 
following "The World Today." 
</P>
<P>
Even CNN executives say wooing viewers from the long-established network 
newscasts will be a gradual process, because viewing habits are hard to break. 
"We do not expect a tidal wave coming out of the blocks," says CNN's Amos. "One 
thing we are cognizant of is that news programming takes a long time to build 
an audience."

The skies were leaden, the Ukraina Hotel was equally gloomy and the passers-by

The actor who became James Bond in half a dozen movie thrillers -- including 
"From Russia with Love" -- in the 1960s, Connery was again in the role of a

Connery is playing Barley Blair, the central character in John Le Carre's new 
novel, "The Russia House," and he was meeting Katya, played by Michelle 
Pfeiffer, who begins as a courier for a Soviet scientist smuggling secret 
military information to the West and becomes the woman for whom Blair is ready 
to sacrifice everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Glasnost and perestroika seem to be serious," Connery said, referring to 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of political openness and overall 
reforms. "They are letting us do this film here although it's about spies and 
traitors and that sort of thing, and they are going to publish Le Carre's book 
themselves in Russian. You have to say that the system here has changed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, they would not have let us in, and probably would have 
denounced the film as 'anti-Soviet.' Today, they are helping us all they can to 
do this film. I think they have gotten over their secretiveness and paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
To Paul Maslansky, the film's co-producer, "The Russia House" is far more a 
love story in a setting of espionage than one of East-West politics merely 
spiced with a bit of romance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Le Carre wanted to write a love story, a story about people and what 
motivates them and what predicaments they find themselves in as a result of 
love, and naturally he set it in the world that he knows best," Maslansky said. 
"But it's also quite true that Gorbachev's Russia is not the 'evil empire' as 
people used to imagine the Soviet Union to be, and that means it is a place 
where this kind of romance can happen without some threat to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"A Le Carre novel, however, is very difficult to make into a movie. He is very, 
very wordy, but he uses words to draw pictures that are hard to reproduce on 
the screen. He seldom writes action sequences -- there are no car crashes, no 
chases -- and he loves ambiguity. I hope this picture will be a tapestry of 
Moscow and Leningrad, one of great mood and rich feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Maslansky, who has produced two other movies in the Soviet Union, said that 
script was reviewed by Moscow Film Studio, one of whose affiliated companies 
has contracted to provide some equipment and crew and arrange the scenes for 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, they wanted script control, and they insisted on it," Maslansky 
said. "This time, they just wanted to make sure there was no pornography, 
nothing anti-Soviet, nothing that would give the Soviet Union a bad image. But 
this is a story in which everyone comes out quite human." 
</P>
<P>
With a screenplay by Tom Stoppard, "The Russia House" has Fred Schepisi as its 
director and producer and a budget of $21 million from Pathe International. Its 
cast includes Roy Scheider, James Fox, John Mahoney and Klaus-Maria Brandauer. 
</P>
<P>
Filming began in Leningrad two weeks ago and will continue here until early 
November, when the cast and crew move to London, Lisbon and Vancouver. The film 
is scheduled for release next autumn. 
</P>
<P>
Although Maslansky and Schepisi praise the cooperation they received from 
Corona Films, the Soviet-West German joint venture that is assisting them here, 
the filming is something of a study in mismatched cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, time is money, and the meter is running all the time," Maslansky said. 
"For them, there is always tomorrow, so no need to push so hard today. They get 
paid no more for working harder or faster, but we lose money if we don't. What 
we use five or six people to do -- say, lighting a scene -- they will use 11 or 
12. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, our directors can do a lot of takes of a scene, maybe a 
dozen, and theirs are given much less film, enough to do perhaps four takes, 
making them more careful in setting up a scene." 
</P>
<P>
None of this surprised Maslansky, who made one film, "The Red Tent," with 
Connery here 25 years ago, and then took over the production in Leningrad of 
"The Bluebird," with Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed really," Maslansky said. "Time has generally stood still. 
Their system still constrains them in many ways. And it is tough to get people 
to work 14 hours a day when they get no more out of it than if they worked six 
or seven. 
</P>
<P>
"When we did 'Bluebird,' we had the right people, and it worked. This also is 
working well, extremely well. As many mistakes are made by my side as by 
theirs. But, when you have shooting costs of maybe $10,000 an hour, the 
time-money ratio is severe." 
</P>
<P>
The filming is a massive undertaking in logistics. More than 50 specialized 
vehicles, everything from catering wagons to sound trucks, have been brought 
from Britain and Finland. Tons of food have been imported to feed the cast and 
crew, about 60 from abroad and a similar number hired locally, so that there 
will be a minimum loss of shooting time.

SCULPTOR, PAINTER WIN $15,000 VISUAL ARTS AWARDS

Two artists with strong ties to the Los Angeles area are among 10 winners in 
the ninth annual Awards in the Visual Arts program, a national competition 
funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts to recognize outstanding 
emerging artistic talent. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of conceptual sculptor Ann Hamilton of Santa Barbara and painter 
Raymond Saunders, who lives in Oakland but has also resided in Santa Monica, 
was formally announced Sunday by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
The Winston-Salem, N.C., arts agency runs the award program under grants from 
the endowment, the Rockefeller Foundation, BMW of North America Inc. and the 
Equitable Foundation. Hamilton, 33, is currently spending a year completing a 
special project at the Headlands Center for the Arts in Marin County. A 
specialist in installations, Hamilton was chosen last year to develop an 
environmental sculpture called "the capacity of absorption," on view at the 
Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary Contemporary from December, 1988, 
through February. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, 54, uses a variety of media, including oil and watercolors. His work 
was featured in an exhibited titled "Raymond Saunders: Some Choices," last year 
at the Long Beach Museum of Art. His work was also shown in 1987 at the 
Hunsaker/Schlesinger Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Each recipient receives a $15,000 grant and inclusion in a traveling show 
featuring work by all 10 winners. The program's 1990 show opens in May at the 
New Orleans Museum of Art and travels later in the year to a gallery under 
construction at the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art and to the Fogg 
Art Museum at Harvard University. Some of the work will be shown at the BMW 
Gallery in New York in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners include: Mike Glier of Hoosick Falls, N.Y., drawing; Lisa Hoke of 
New York City, sculpture; Lorna Simpson of Brooklyn, N.Y., photography; Martin 
Emanuel of Atlanta, sculpture; Malcolm Cochran of Columbus, Ohio, sculpture; 
Tony Tasset of Chicago, sculpture, and Randy Twaddle of Houston, drawing. 
</P>
<P>
The Awards in the Visual Arts format divides the country into 10 regions, each 
of which contains roughly the same artist population. Manhattan is a separate 
region. Other districts include several states. The program is intended to 
guarantee geographical recognition for promising artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really wonderful, very generous award that allows each of us to keep 
doing work," said Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders said he spent his summers in Oakland and winters in Santa Monica until 
a couple of years ago when he changed his base of operations exclusively to the 
Bay Area. But he said he intends to re-establish at least a part-time residence 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The program came to political prominence earlier this year over its inclusion, 
in its 1988 edition, of photographs by Andres Serrano, including his image of a 
crucifix immersed in urine. The selection was one of the factors that brought 
about a summerlong clash between conservatives in Congress and the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important to do work you believe in and not be compromised," 
Hamilton said. "I think there's going to be a fight to save the NEA. That's the 
larger issue."

GRETZKY TIES HOWE'S SCORING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EDMONTON, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was called the Great Gretzky even before he played his first National Hockey 
League game. On Sunday night, in only his 11th season and before the adoring 
fans of his former team, he pulled even with Gordie Howe, hockey's greatest 
all-time scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, at age 28, tied Howe's record of 1,850 points with an assist 
early in the first period of the Los Angeles Kings' game against the Edmonton 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky fed defenseman Tom Laidlaw, who put the puck in front of the net, and 
Bernie Nicholls knocked it past Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford at 4:32 for 
the game's opening goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was fitting that Gretzky tied the record against the Oilers, who he led to 
four Stanley Cup titles in nine seasons. Oilers owner Peter Pocklington traded 
him to Los Angeles on Aug. 9, 1988 in the biggest trade in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was revered by Edmonton fans and left the city in tears on the day of 
the trade. He had predicted before the season that he would break Howe's mark 
on his first visit of the season to the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's specialness, Howe said, made the loss of the record easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was, pardon the expression, some clown breaking it, it would have 
bothered me," Howe said earlier. "But not Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Howe was at the Northlands Coliseum Sunday night, along with NHL president John 
Ziegler and Gretzky's family. Howe scored 801 goals and added 1,049 assists in 
26 seasons. Gretzky, playing his 780th game, was one point short of a tie going 
into the game and the Edmonton fans were rooting for the record to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky already had the NHL assists record with 1,209. He's fourth in goals 
with 640 but Howe's record of 801 doesn't figure to last too much longer. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is different from all the rest," said Gretzky, who holds or shares 51 
NHL records. "There's no urgency to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The swiftness is what makes it so special. Gretzky is scoring points 126 
percent faster than Howe. If he plays the same number of games (1,767) and 
continues this pace, he would finish with 4,196 points. 
</P>
<P>
At similar paces in their quests, Hank Aaron would have hit 1,614 home runs in 
breaking Babe Ruth's record of 714 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would have scored 
71,007 points (a 67.9 average) in breaking Wilt Chamberlain's National 
Basketball Assn. record of 31,419. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Howe realized shortly after he began playing that Gretzky would 
easily top his records. 
</P>
<P>
"When he started pumping out 200 points, 80 goals, you knew it wasn't going to 
last long," Howe said. "One year he got 215 points and that was 85 more than 
the next guy. I got 85 points one year and broke a record." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's been scoring so fast that he's been the league's MVP in nine of 10 
seasons since joining the NHL. He has seven scoring titles, was an All-Star in 
all 10 years and has been MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs twice. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, Gretzky's idol, took over the all-time scoring lead from Montreal's 
Maurice Richard on Jan. 16, 1960, when he scored his 947th point. Howe said he 
didn't recall a big fuss being made. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember. I played 32 years without a helmet," he said, adding in his 
years with the World Hockey Association. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Malone led the NHL in scoring in its first year, 1917-18, but was overtaken 
in career points the next season by Cy Denneny. Malone went back ahead in 
1919-20, but Denneny overtook him again in February of 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Howie Morenz took the lead in 1931 and was passed by Nels Stewart in 1937-38. 
Bill Cowley went ahead in 1945-46 and Elmer Lach went in front in 1952-53. 
Richard took over the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gretzky has equaled Howe. And he did it in the most special way: against 
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"This summer we were talking about Gordie's record," Edmonton's Kevin Lowe 
said, "and Wayne told me he had a chance to do it in Edmonton. And I'm saying 
to myself, 'Wayne's the only guy in the world who would know what the schedule 
is in July.' "

GAME 2: OAKLAND GETS READY TO CROSS BRIDGE WITH A 2-0 LEAD AFTER FOUR-HIT

FRANCISCO.

<P>
The arctic climes of Candlestick Park have yet to be weathered in this World 
Series, but already, after two games in Oakland, one team has been left out in 
the cold. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in as many nights Sunday, the Will Clark-Kevin 
Mitchell-Brett Butler San Francisco Giants were chilled by the Oakland 
Athletics, losing Game 2 by a 5-1 score before 49,388 at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 1, the score was 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
If you sense that this World Series is on the verge of turning into the Blowout 
by the Bay, you're getting warm. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, the Giants have managed a total of nine hits. They scored their 
only run of the weekend when Oakland's Sunday starter, Mike Moore, bobbled a 
ball long enough to take him out of a double-play opportunity. And the bottom 
five of the Giants' starting lineup -- Matt Williams, Ernest Riles, Candy 
Maldonado, Terry Kennedy and Jose Uribe -- are a combined one for 33. 
</P>
<P>
"You score one run in two games, you're not going to win too many games like 
that," San Francisco Manager Roger Craig said, applying some basic math. "The 
bottom line has been their pitching. It's been outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, it was Dave Stewart and a five-hit complete-game performance. 
Sunday it was Moore, who allowed four hits in seven innings, and Rick Honeycutt 
(1 1/3 hitless innings) and Dennis Eckersley (the final two outs). 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Terry Steinbach contributed a three-run home run for Oakland, but this 
evening again belonged to the A's aces. If Oakland learned anything from its 
defeat to the Dodgers in last year's World Series, it's that offense may sell 
tickets, but pitching is what wins championships. 
</P>
<P>
Which is one reason why Moore was on the mound for Game 2. Overwhelmed by Orel 
Hershiser, the A's did enough introspection during the winter of 1988 to figure 
out that adding another starting pitcher to the rotation might be worth their 
while. 
</P>
<P>
So last Dec. 6, the A's signed Moore as a free agent by way of Seattle and have 
parlayed those millions into 21 victories in 1989 -- 19 during the regular 
season, one against Toronto in the American League playoffs and, one in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of him," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. "This was his second 
appearance in the postseason and he's done equally well against two outstanding 
hitting clubs. He had to use it all today -- fastball, slider, forkball, 
changeup -- but you need all those things against a good-hitting ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is assuming one buys La Russa's description of the Giants as a 
good-hitting team. Any takers out there? Williams, San Francisco's No. 5 
hitter, is zero for eight with four strikeouts. Robby Thompson, who bats 
second, and Riles, who bats sixth, are both hitless in seven at-bats. Below 
Riles, you don't want to know about. 
</P>
<P>
Take Clark and Mitchell out of this lineup and, basically, you have the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's third inning provided a World Series golden moment: The scoring of a 
San Francisco run. This event transpired after Kennedy singled and Uribe hit a 
sharp hopper back to Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Easy double play, but Moore double-pumped before throwing to second base. 
Kennedy was forced but Walt Weiss' relay to first base was too late to retire 
Uribe. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Uribe was advanced third on a single by Butler through a hole in 
the left side of a shifted infield, from where he scored on a fly ball to 
center field by Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Butler also made it to third base -- he stole second and took third on a wild 
pitch -- but was stranded there when Clark struck out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
For a few heady moments, the Giants were tied with the A's at one run apiece. 
But then they played the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Four Oakland runs . . . and a 2-0 Oakland advantage in the World Series was 
instantly in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco, the slumping giant, began the outburst by ceasing his wild 
flailing at the plate long enough to draw a walk from Giant starter Rick 
Reuschel. Big Daddy should've known better. Before that encounter, Canseco was 
hitless in his previous 22 World Series at-bats -- dating to his first-inning 
grand slam against Tim Belcher in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco scored on a double by Dave Parker that struck the right-field fence so 
hard, feathers flew. Or at least they did within moments thereafter, when play 
had to interrupted so umpires could hunt a pheasant -- a pheasant? -- that 
somehow wandered onto the field in the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the umpires finally tracked it down . . . in fowl territory. 
</P>
<P>
When order was restored, Reuschel walked Dave Henderson and struck out Mark 
McGwire, laying the groundwork for Steinbach's game-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
On a 2-and-0 pitch, Steinbach delivered, sending the ball into the left-field 
seats and the Giants reeling. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach doesn't do this frequently -- during the regular season, he homered 
seven times -- but he sure knows how to pick his spots. It was Steinbach's home 
run off Dwight Gooden in the 1988 All-Star game that earned the American League 
a 2-1 victory and Steinbach the game's MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
This one came complete with a subplot: La Russa called Steinbach's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday's game, La Russa made the prediction that Steinbach would hit a 
home run off Reuschel, citing the pitcher's tendency to rely on low pitches and 
the catcher's tendency to hit low pitches a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, however, La Russa tried to downplay it. 
</P>
<P>
"I said something like that, but if the truth be known, I say those kind of 
things every game," La Russa said. "I usually say that about four or five 
hitters a game." 
</P>
<P>
For La Russa, this was a good night to be right. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach's home run gave Oakland a 5-1 lead and signaled the end for Reuschel, 
who lasted only four more hitters. His four-plus-inning stint was nearly 
identical to that of San Francisco's Game 1 starter, Scott Garrelts, who also 
allowed five runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
This type of consistency, Craig can live without. 
</P>
<P>
During the postgame press conference, Craig was asked to comment on Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's 6-3, he weighs 260," Craig said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
OK, let's try it again . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he might have been trying to be too fine because he normally doesn't 
walk that many guys," Craig said. "The ball the catcher hit for a home run, he 
got the ball up a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"But he's been my best pitcher since he's been over here." 
</P>
<P>
If that's Craig's best, it might be time to pray for Don Robinson, the Giants' 
scheduled starter for Game 3 at Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
The only breakthrough San Francisco managed this night came in the fifth 
inning, when Kennedy sprang from his crouch behind home plate and threw out 
Rickey Henderson, attempting to steal third base. Thus, Henderson's perfect 
postseason was ended after a streak of nine consecutive successful steals. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Henderson also stole second base in the first inning and had 
a triple and two singles, so Rickey had his say as well. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco clubhouse, the 0-2 deficit hung heavy in the air, with the 
Giants seemingly stunned by the certainty of both beatings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things you can do when you're down, 0-2," Williams 
suggested. "You can read about how many teams have come back from that deficit. 
You can think about it, you can watch the news and hear it. Or, you can just 
block it all out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to block it all out." 
</P>
<P>
If they don't, the Giants could find themselves blocked out of this World 
Series almost as quickly as it began.

Wake me when it's over. On second thought, don't bother. 
</P>
<P>
Having trouble sleeping, are you? Try the 1989 World Series. As a soporific, 
it's second to none. The Valium World Series. A barbiturate in cleats. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is, it's not going to last long. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants are just the piano in this recital. The Oakland A's 
have all the solos. The Giants are just the scenery. The show is being put on 
by Oakland. Like the magician who saws the girl in half. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are half-sawn. 
</P>
<P>
You know, in the fight game, they have these pugs, they call them "trial 
horses," or they refer to one of them as "strictly an opponent." 
</P>
<P>
These guys got to be able to take it but not dish it out. Hit, but not too 
hard. They got to be respectable but not successful. 
</P>
<P>
That's the Giants in this tournament. The backdrop. The dart board. The guys 
getting the knives thrown at them. The stooges. The straight men. Like the guy 
who says, "How hot was it?" to the comic or "No, Mr. Bones, why do firemen wear 
red suspenders?"

If you missed Game 2, just rerun the tape of Game 1. Or get some pictures of a 
cat eating a canary. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are being dispatched without a whimper. They look like a bunch of 
guys going to the electric chair. They've scored one run on nine hits in 18 
innings. The team logo should be a foul tip rampant on a field of popups. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics scarcely notice they've showed up. They think it's just a 
continuation of batting practice. Their starting pitchers have trouble lasting 
five innings. Their pitchers haved given up three home runs, three doubles, one 
triple and 11 other base hits, so far. They should incorporate as a charitable 
institution. It isn't as if they give up home runs to the registered sultans of 
swat of the game. Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire haven't hit one yet. The 
Giants' pitchers give up home runs to .233 hitters, guys who hit only three 
homers all year and six lifetime, guys who don't go into home run trots but 
turn around to see who did it. 
</P>
<P>
The World Series hasn't had a single exciting moment to date. It's about as 
exciting as watching a travelogue or home movies of your brother-in-law's 
Caribbean cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Every game is over by the third inning. It's like watching a mystery movie 
where they tip off the murderer in the second reel. 
</P>
<P>
You knew the 1989 World Series (and pennant race) was a foregone conclusion as 
soon as the Athletics got Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Giving the Oakland A's Rickey Henderson is like giving a shark another tooth, a 
bear another claw. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson is not a player, he's a team. He's so fast, he's invisible. He 
wouldn't even make a blip on a radar screen once he gets started. He was 
running 9.7 second hundreds when he was in grade school. He stole 130 bases in 
149 games once and is the greatest baserunner in history, or will be when he 
steals just 68 more next season to overtake Lou Brock. 
</P>
<P>
If you walk him, you might as well give him a double. Yet, he walks almost as 
much as Babe Ruth. He led the league twice in walks. This is because a pitcher 
doesn't just throw him one of those "Here, hit this! It's better than walking 
you!" pitches. If they do, Rickey hits it out of the park. He hit 28 home runs 
one year (and stole 87 bases). He hit 24 homers another year (and stole 80 
bases). You get no options, no bailout with Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
He may be pound-for-pound, the best player in the game. Inch-for-inch, there's 
no argument (he's 5-foot-10). Anything this dangerous should at least have 
rattles. 
</P>
<P>
The thing about his strike zone is, he doesn't have any. He's unpitchable. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Yankees gave him up is not known but should be prosecutable. When he 
left Yankee Stadium, he was only hitting .247 and had stolen 25 bases. At 
Oakland, he stole 52 bases in 85 games and only got caught stealing six times. 
At New York, he got caught 14 times out of the 29. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey won't cop out to feeling discouragement in New York. "In the hot 
weather, your legs get looser," he says with a perfectly straight face. Rickey 
came over to Oakland the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
He hit .294 when he returned to Oakland (where he had had some of his salad 
years -- .303, .319, 130, 108 and 100 stolen bases). He scored 72 runs in 85 
games, batted in 70 runs in 85 games, got 90 hits and nine home runs (vs. three 
in New York). 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have no more idea what to do with Rickey Henderson in the World 
Series than Toronto did in the playoffs. (Against Toronto, he stole eight 
bases, hit two home runs, batted .400 and scored eight runs). 
</P>
<P>
Against the Giants Sunday night, he reached base every time. The only time the 
Giants retired him was at third base and that was an upset. They should have 
bronzed the ball for catcher Terry Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wanted to know in the interview room what the difference between the 
Oakland A's who lost to the Dodgers last year and the team which is winning as 
if the Giants aren't there this year. The answer is Rickey Henderson. He's made 
a mismatch of the World Series. He won't even be 31 years old till December 25. 
Oakland must feel as if he came down the chimney, anyway, or they found him 
under the tree. The guy in the Santa Claus suit would be George Steinbrenner. 
But, it's Oakland giving with the Ho, Ho, Ho. In a sour grapes statement, a 
Yankee scout complained, "Over there, he gave effort only every other game." 
</P>
<P>
With Rickey Henderson, that might be quite enough. It'd be one way to even up 
the World Series.

MILLS IS READY AND WILLING TO PLAY, BUT HE MUST WAIT; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: FORMER FAIRFAX STAR CAN PRACTICE WITH ARIZONA, BUT NCAA WILL DECIDE 
IF HE'S ELIGIBLE.

<P>
On the first day of practice Sunday, Chris Mills wore a gray and blue jersey 
that said "Arizona Basketball," a moveable message that seemed misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, a 19-year-old sophomore, remains an unofficial member of the Arizona 
Wildcat team while awaiting a landmark ruling from the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. that will decide if he will be eligible to play this season. 
</P>
<P>
By a simple majority vote, the 22 Division I members of the NCAA Council 
meeting today through Wednesday in Indianapolis will decide the fate of Mills, 
who transfered from the University of Kentucky after it was placed on probation 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Mills was ruled ineligible to play again at Kentucky as part of the NCAA 
sanctions against the school. He decided to attend Arizona in June and the 
university petitioned the NCAA to waive its one-year waiting period for 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's request for such a waiver have been studied by both the NCAA Council 
and the Infractions Committee and a favorable ruling is expected. 
</P>
<P>
One high-ranking official of a university, who did not wish to be named but was 
familiar with the content of the written instructions that the NCAA Council 
will consider, said he was certain of a decision in Mills' favor based on the 
information before the council. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they can turn him down," Arizona Athletic Director Cedric 
Dempsey said. "They were never able to say he was directly involved (in the 
Kentucky violations). 
</P>
<P>
Mills, who has threatened to sue the NCAA if his waiver is not granted, 
believes he will continue to practice and play with his new teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm saying that it's probably going in my favor, but you can't 
never tell until it actually comes out," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mills was never mentioned in the NCAA's report of its sanctions 
against Kentucky, one of the specific infractions involved him at least 
indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
After he had signed a letter of intent with Kentucky and was still attending 
Fairfax High School, then-Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey was found to 
have sent $1,000 in cash to his father, Claud Mills. Chris Mills had been the 
object of an intense recruiting war between Kentucky, UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas, 
Louisville and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
The money the NCAA said Casey sent to the elder Mills was found in an opened 
air express package. 
</P>
<P>
Claud Mills, who offered to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence, 
said he sees no reason why his son wouldn't receive the waiver from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"They never had any evidence of anything," Claud Mills said. "And it's not like 
he transferred himself. They asked him to transfer and not to go back to UK. 
</P>
<P>
"Arizona is a school that's very, very strict. That's what we thought of 
Kentucky, too. Chris abided by their rules." 
</P>
<P>
Claud Mills said he was not inclined to sue the NCAA if the NCAA Council ruled 
that Chris Mills was not allowed to play this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to know why, as far as justice is concerned," he said. 
"But I would go along with it because I wouldn't want to buck the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said he had no quarrel with the NCAA over the nearly three months it 
has taken for a decision on Mills. But Dempsey said there is only one way the 
NCAA Council can rule. 
</P>
<P>
"From Chris' standpoint, if they turn him down, they are making an assumption 
of guilt which others previously never were able to determine," Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the NCAA's enforcement division, the NCAA Council 
may decide to waive bylaw 14-9-22 and allow Mills to play "upon determination 
of the innocence or inadvertent involvement of the student-athlete in the 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has never before issued a ruling in such a case. UCLA Athletic 
Director Pete Dalis said that Chancellor Charles Young, a member of the NCAA 
Council, will not vote in the Mills matter because the school tried to recruit 
him. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of practice, Mills was eager to put his past troubles aside. 
He said he has already gotten used to the desert heat and taken up residence in 
an off-campus apartment with two freshman teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing has made me a lot stronger," he said. "What's past is 
history. I'm just trying to go on from here.' 
</P>
<P>
Mills' father remains firmly in his corner, expecting him to stay at Arizona 
for his remaining three years and graduate.

IT'S MIXED EMOTIONS FOR OILERS 
</P>

<P>
It was another hockey game, but it also wasn't. To the Edmonton Oilers, Sunday 
night's game against the Kings was a broiling vortex of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the Oilers' former captain, their current foe; their former leader, 
their current nemesis; their former close friend . . . 
</P>
<P>
Although reporters had quizzed the Kings' players about the distraction of 
Gretzky nearing Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record, when it finally happened 
Sunday night at the sold-out Northlands Coliseum, it seemed the Oilers had been 
the more distracted. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' thoughts were on winning the game, which they did, 5-4. When Gretzky 
got the record-breaking goal in the third period, the Kings swarmed the ice in 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
As the game was stopped with 53 seconds left for an awards ceremony, the entire 
King team stood by on the ice at a kind of respectful attention, whereas the 
Oilers slouched and slumped at their bench, not wanting to watch, but desperate 
to participate. For they knew that it had been them, not the Kings, who for 10 
years had provided Gretzky that rare hockey climate that allowed him to compile 
his impressive scoring statistics. 
</P>
<P>
While the Oilers acknowledged Gretzky's achievement with the presentation of a 
diamond bracelet, the team honored him later in a more meaningful fashion. The 
players who had been his teammates through Edmonton's often-stormy history all 
reserved the highest sort of praise for him -- the kind of praise that comes 
from men in your own profession, men who labored alongside you and, clearly, 
men who harbor a sincere admiration for your accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly-empty Oiler locker room after the game, players were saying how 
they hated to lose the game, but also how glad they were for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier, Edmonton's team captain, wrestled with the awkward words that 
spilled out as he tried to explain what Gretzky has meant to the city, the 
organization and to his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Messier abandoned his search for eloquence and put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"We came from a (expletive) expansion organization that went on to win four 
Stanley Cups," Messier said. "He had a big part of it. No one here is ever 
going to forget it . . . or him." 
</P>
<P>
Messier and Gretzky had locked in a sweaty and sincere embrace during the 
on-ice ceremony to commemorate the record. Words were whispered. But, for them, 
the emotions rendered words inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't need any words," Messier said, struggling with his anger at the loss 
and his joy for his friend's accomplishments. "It's obvious how Wayne and I 
feel about each other." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton defenseman Charlie Huddy, a harsh and relentless player on the ice, 
seemed washed with sentiment when he spoke of Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about all we went through together . . . " he said, shaking his 
head. "Wayne will always be a part of it here."

Walter and Phyllis Gretzky arrived in Edmonton Sunday morning in plenty of time 
to see their oldest son break Gordie Howe's National Hockey League scoring 
record. 
</P>
<P>
With Walter busy escorting Wayne's horse, Golden Pheasant, to the prestigious 
Arc de Triomphe race in Paris last weekend. And with a longstanding commitment 
to be at a wedding Saturday, they took a chance that Wayne would not get five 
points against the Vancouver Canucks Friday night. They were right. He made 
three points to close to within two, saving the record for the city in which he 
scored most of his points. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to happen in Edmonton," Walter said with a knowing nod. "For one thing, 
that's the way Wayne had it figured. Besides, it's more fitting, and that's 
just the way things happen for Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if his life has been prewritten. If you go over all the things that 
have happened in his life, one thing after another, it's as if it was destiny. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it's a bit eerie. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
His own father finds his golden touch unbelieveble? "I'm amazed at him," Walter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And proud of him. Not only for the goals and the assists, but for the way he 
has handled himself through all the success. 
</P>
<P>
Walter likes to tell of the night that Wayne scored his 50th goal in the 39th 
game of the 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
The family had planned to be at the game Wayne scored his 50th goal, knowing 
that it would be well under the milestone of 50 goals in 50 games. But Wayne 
was five goals away going into the 39th game, and Walter figured he wouldn't 
get it at the game at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Wayne phoned home to Brantford, Ontario, with the news. He told 
Walter, who said something like, "You did it, heh?" And then Wayne said he had 
better get going because "all those people" were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had let reporters, TV crews, the owner and all wait while he called 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy, but when I thought about it, I was more happy about the call 
than the record," Walter said. "Think about it. He was a young man who had just 
done something incredible, and everyone around him was all excited. But he took 
time, first, to call his mum and dad. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wondered from time to time if I would have done the same thing. I would 
have remembered them, but I don't know whether I would have thought of them at 
that particular moment." 
</P>
<P>
The Gretzky family is close, and has always been closely involved with the 
boys' hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Walter played junior hockey, but was too small to make it as a pro. Which is 
what everyone used to tell Wayne. But Walter, who is a telephone company 
technician, taught his son all the tricks a little player needs. He taught him 
to play smart. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he tried to instill in Wayne a work ethic. He stressed the value 
of perseverance and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
In a TV special after Gretzky's first season as a King, Walter said: "I've seen 
him spend hours and hours and hours that no other boy would do, just practicing 
one little move. Sometimes he spends a year or two before he'll even try 
something in a game." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne was practicing shooting even before he could skate. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne used to slide around on a slick pine wood floor in his socks, pretending 
that he was skating, and he'd use a little souvenir stick to shoot a ball into 
a goal in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"My mum, (Wayne's grandmother Mary, who died last December) would sit in a 
chair with a goalie stick playing goalie for him. She was a hockey fanatic long 
before Wayne came along." 
</P>
<P>
Walter built a rink in the back yard and taught Wayne to skate. The Gretzkys 
have film of Wayne skating at 2, not at all unusual for kids in Canada. And he 
was playing hockey when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
Once he scored his first goal, at 6 in a league for 10-year-olds, it started to 
happen. Everything started to fall into place. 
</P>
<P>
There was a manifest destiny to Gretzky's hockey career. 
</P>
<P>
Walter swears he wasn't a pushy father. He didn't make Wayne log all that time 
in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't the kind of kid you would have to send out to practice," Walter 
said. "With Wayne, you'd have to make him come in. I'd be out there yelling, 
'Don't be shooting at the side of the house. Look what you've done to the 
foundation!' " 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before his brothers were out there with him. 
</P>
<P>
Only one brother, Glenn, who works in real estate in the Edmonton area, was at 
the game Sunday night to see Wayne set the record. Glenn's hockey days are over 
now. Keith (The Great One's brother who has been dubbed The Good One) is with 
the Buffalo organization and playing with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the 
International Hockey League. Brent, who is another good one, is still playing 
Junior A hockey in Belleville. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne's sister Kim was not in Edmonton Sunday, although Walter's sister, Ellen, 
was. Ellen, who has Down Syndrome, lives with Walter and Phyllis since the 
death of her mother. Gretzky's wife Janet Jones also was in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The home of Walter and Phyllis Gretzky is unpretentious, but has turned into 
something of an unofficial Gretzky museum. 
</P>
<P>
Lined up among the wall-to-wall trophies, plaques and framed photographs are 
more than 200 of what Walter calls "special" sticks commemorating records or 
titles or hat tricks . . . 
</P>
<P>
Walter will be toting home more memorabilia after the ceremonies here Sunday 
and the ceremonies scheduled at the Forum Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall found Walter Sunday morning in the lobby of the hotel 
where the team was staying, before Walter had had the opportunity to make 
contact with his son. McNall started to fill him in on the plan for the 
ceremony, saying, "Wayne wants me to take you down so that you can go out on 
the ice . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Walter collapsed into the chair behind him. "No!," he said. "Wayne wants me to 
go out on the ice? Me? It was Wayne's idea? Oh, my goodness."

Once in a great while, you feel privileged. You get to see something special -- 
someone special. You get to tell people the rest of your life: "I was there." 
You get to describe what you saw, as best you can. Except where Wayne Gretzky 
is concerned, seeing is disbelieving. You want to do more than just watch him. 
You want to curtsy or bow. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he is the King. 
</P>
<P>
His stick is his scepter. He must have pulled it from a stone. It has mythic 
qualities. It can slash dragons and split armor. It is a sword with a curved 
blade, and its justice is both terrible and swift. It should be granted a name 
of distinction, like a rifle called Old Betsy, or a baseball bat labeled 
Wonderboy, or, yes, if so decreed, an Excalibur-like weapon, full of magic and 
might. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he is the King. 
</P>
<P>
He has divided and conquered two countries. His Canadian subjects cannot help 
but forgive him for leaving. They thanked him again Sunday for granting them an 
audience. They hailed his return from another land, cried out his name, gave 
him encouragement even as he sided with their natural adversaries. They even 
bestowed gifts upon him, in celebration of a successful crusade. 
</P>
<P>
They still accepted him as the King. 
</P>
<P>
Homage was paid to Wayne Gretzky in the ice palace known as Northlands 
Coliseum. These people knew something special when they saw it. They asked for 
it and got it. Even those in an Edmonton throng of 17,503 who rued the day 
Wayne Gretzky left for Los Angeles, who wished for their Oilers to show the 
visiting Kings how the game of hockey was meant to be played, found themselves 
touched by what happened. There was something so fair and appropriate about it, 
something so . . . well, proper. 
</P>
<P>
Even the players themselves treated the coronation of Wayne Gretzky as hockey's 
all-time scoring king respectfully, bordering on worshipfully. After the goal, 
which came with a suspenseful 53 seconds to go and Gretzky's own goalie pulled 
from the game, there were tributes from both friends and foes. Gordie Howe's 
record was gone for good, and moments such as this were rare. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers sat or stood near their bench, a few looking impatient for the game 
to resume, but all polite as could be. Jari Kurri sat on the side rail, legs 
dangling a foot from the ice, while Mark Messier rewarded their 
once-upon-a-time teammate with a diamond-crusted bracelet. "Presented with 
friendship," it was inscribed. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Kings, they fanned out along one of the rink's two blue lines and 
drummed the icy surface with their sticks, like musicians who salute a 
performer by tapping their violins with their bows. A player would have had to 
have a face as hard as a goaltender's mask not to be visibly moved by this 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before, Gretzky had broomed a backhand into the net, beyond Edmonton 
goalie Bill Ranford's reach, to start the party. Kurri and Messier, his trusty 
old friends, occupied the ice at the time. Kevin Lowe, possibly Gretzky's 
closest friend among the Oilers, happened to be in the crease, closest to him, 
unable to delay the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored and then sprang into the arms of the nearest teammate, Dave 
Taylor, who has waited longer than any other King for something to celebrate. 
Soon they were joined by Bernie Nicholls, Luc Robitaille, Steve Duchesne and 
Larry Robinson, who slammed Gretzky into the glass harder than any opponent has 
in years. Then came the mob from the bench, given special dispensation to spill 
forth from it, for just this one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
They were on Cloud 99. 
</P>
<P>
All night long, Gretzky had gone through hell and high frozen water, trying to 
get the record-breaking point. He took a stick in the eye from Peter Eriksson 
and got boomed into the boards by Jeff Beukeboom. He was tripped and flipped. 
He whipped slap shots and threw a knuckle-puck that wobbled and flew softly 
through the air, bouncing crazily before Ranford batted it down. For one crazy 
instant he even went one-on-five, trying to zig and zag, until you said to 
yourself, much the way Gretzky himself does on that Bo Jackson athletic-shoe 
commercial, uh, "No." 
</P>
<P>
What fate awaited the King? 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there were powers at work assuring him that something special lie 
ahead. When at last the point would be scored, it wouldn't come in the second 
period of a 7-2 loss to the Boston Bruins, or some such thing. It would come in 
the final minute of a game in the city that was once King Wayne's private 
dominion, and wouldst be followed by a game-winning goal in overtime, just in 
case you still weren't absolutely certain that the gods were crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe was there, to send in the crown. His successor was the same young 
prodigy who used to hang around with Murray Howe, Gordie's youngest son, and 
annoy the boy with questions about what his dad was really like. Gordie Howe 
could not -- would not -- have hand-picked anyone else in the world to be the 
next him. He might as well have taken a hockey stick and knighted Wayne Gretzky 
with it, asking him to arise and assume his rightful place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he is the King, and possibly shall be so, happily ever possibly will 
be so, happily ever after.

SO FAR, LA RUSSA'S DECISIONS KO GIANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A graduate of the Florida State law school and a member of the Florida bar, 
Tony La Russa understands the risk of circumstantial evidence and avoids 
employing it in his role as the Oakland Athletics' manager. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa operates from a bank of computers, scouting reports, statistics and 
comparative percentages. 
</P>
<P>
No manager, his players insist, is better prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in preparing his lineup for the 1989 World Series, La Russa made a pair of 
decisions that seemed at odds with each other and were hunches at best. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence? On the surface, even less than circumstantial. 
</P>
<P>
"I do trust my gut a lot, but that's nothing more than feeling I know a lot 
about my players. I wouldn't call that a hunch," La Russa said Sunday night 
after his A's defeated the San Francisco Giants, 5-1, for a 2-0 World Series 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
If the Giants are finding this hard to stomach, blame La Russa's gut. 
</P>
<P>
First he benched the versatile Mike Gallego -- a guy he recently called his 
team's most valuable player -- and employed Walt Weiss at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss was the American League's rookie of the year last season, but was 
sidelined for more than two months of the 1989 season with a knee injury and 
has had trouble regaining his batting eye. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, however, is a switch-hitter and La Russa announced that he wanted to 
load his lineup with left-handed bats against right-hander Scott Garrelts, the 
Game 1 starter. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss responded with a home run in the 5-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Along with that, however, La Russa decided to keep another left-handed hitter, 
catcher Ron Hassey, on the bench and went with the right-handed hitting Terry 
Steinbach against Garrelts and Game 2 starter Rick Reuschel, who is also a 
right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"Different considerations," La Russa said Sunday of the decision to start Weiss 
and not Hassey. "That's why I'm paid to manage." 
</P>
<P>
So who's arguing? 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach merely singled against Garrelts to help ignite a three-run rally, 
then hammered a three-run, fourth inning homer against Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
His reward? 
</P>
<P>
Hassey will start Game 3 against Don Robinson, who is just as right-handed as 
Garrelts and Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
Who can figure? 
</P>
<P>
Not Steinbach, who smiled, shook his head and said he hasn't come to grips yet 
with all of La Russa's thinking and is not sure he ever will. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron and I expect to play every day, but we respect each other and we respect 
Tony's decisions," Steinbach said. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not always agree with his reasoning but his door is open and he'll 
always give us a reason -- stats, gut instinct, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pitching staff has led the American League in ERA for two straight years, 
and both Ron and myself feel we've contributed to that. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's a tribute to the type club management has built here that the 
nine guys on the field aren't the only ones who contribute." 
</P>
<P>
La Russa agreed, saying it was difficult to sit Gallego, difficult to sit 
Hassey. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to sit Steiny Tuesday night, but that's what happens when 
you have a good club," the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
And why Steinbach Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He generally catches when Mike Moore pitches," La Russa said, "and I've been 
watching him closely. 
</P>
<P>
"He's swinging the bat well and working hard and that pays off." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, La Russa said he was so confident that Steinbach would dig into a 
Reuschel sinker that he predicted to TV reporters that his catcher would hit a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach laughed when he heard that. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I didn't even know I was starting until the lineup was posted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And did he hit a sinker? 
</P>
<P>
"That's about all Reuschel throws," Steinbach said. "I got ahead 2-and-0 and 
was looking for him to get a sinker up in the strike zone, which is what he 
did. It was a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Steinbach's most notable home run came off Dwight Gooden in the 
1988 All-Star game, when he emerged as the most valuable player after Oakland 
fans stuffed the ballot box, making him something of an unjustified starter. 
</P>
<P>
"The All-Star game is an individual thing," he said Sunday night. "This put us 
closer to our team goal. It means a lot more to me." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Steinbach hit only seven homers during a strange season in 
which he batted .301 in April, .385 in May, .292 through June and the two weeks 
before the July All-Star break, then only .216 over the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain that," he said, "except that I feel I used up all my luck in 
the first half. Everything I hit seemed to fall in. I had good at bats and bad 
at bats in the second half, but not that same luck. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely struggled some, but I feel my swing has been coming back lately 
and maybe this will be the start of something good for me." 
</P>
<P>
Said La Russa: "Steiny isn't afraid of anything. He isn't afraid of the 
pressure of a World Series or starting an All-Star game after being ridiculed 
nationally. That's another reason he was in there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Which doesn't explain why he won't be Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Different considerations," reiterated the man who's paid to manage the A's.

'D-ROCK' NOT AS SOLID AS HE HAD EXPECTED; 
</P>
<P>
MISTAKES: BOBBLED PASS, FUMBLED PUNT LEAD TO 10 SEATTLE POINTS AND LEAVE ROOKIE 
BRINSON HURTING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The throbbing in Dana Brinson's right shoulder left the animated Charger who 
goes by the nickname "D-Rock" wincing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," Brinson said through clenched teeth. "It's numb." 
</P>
<P>
But as unforgiving as the burning in his shoulder was, it could not compare to 
the hurt from his bruised ego and wounded pride. 
</P>
<P>
Brinson, a rookie from Nebraska, wanted to make his contribution in place of 
injured H-back Rod Bernstine (knee) one to remember. Instead it turned into one 
he will not forget. 
</P>
<P>
Brinson fumbled a punt that led to a Seattle touchdown. He bobbled a pass that 
the Seahawks intercepted, eventually resulting in a Seattle field goal. And he 
spent the final three minutes of a 17-16 loss to the Seahawks at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium on the sideline after a hit aggravated the shoulder he bruised 
the week before against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those days that I don't want to look back on," Brinson said. "I 
can only blame myself." 
</P>
<P>
To say Brinson's mistakes cost the Chargers the game would be unfair. As Coach 
Dan Henning said, his team made enough errors in the fourth quarter alone to 
lose two games. 
</P>
<P>
But while pinpointing who was to blame for a blocked field goal or extra point 
can be an exacting task, Brinson's mistakes were out in the open for all to see 
. . . and boo. 
</P>
<P>
The first blunder came on the Chargers' second possession. Brinson was open 
near the left sideline for a short pass. Jim McMahon's throw was on the mark, 
but while Brinson's feet kept moving, his hands bobbled the ball, once, twice, 
three times. The third bounce fell into the grasp of inside linebacker Darren 
Comeaux at the Charger 44. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to turn up field, and I lost the ball over my shoulder," Brinson said. 
"The guy was right there, and he pretty much just took it off my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
The interception led to Norm Johnson's 50-yard field goal and a 10-7 Seahawk 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The next error proved even more costly. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense had forced the Seahawks to punt on their first possession 
of the second half. Brinson stood at his own 10 to receive the ball with 
instructions to let it go if it carried beyond the 10. 
</P>
<P>
But just as he was set to field the punt, the ball took a dive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real high punt," Brinson said. "It was coming down with a backspin, 
and it was fading away. It's one of the most difficult punts to catch. I just 
misjudged it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too deep into it. There was no way I could pull back. My feet were set 
to catch the ball, and I couldn't step up. It just faded and hit off the tip of 
my fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle strong safety Nesby Glasgow recovered at the Charger 16. Three player 
later, fullback John Williams was standing in the end zone with a six-yard 
touchdown pass from quarterback Dave Krieg for a 17-10 Seattle lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Not my best outing," Brinson said in sober summary. 
</P>
<P>
The game was supposed to be Brinson's best chance so far to showcase his speed 
and talent in the National Football League. The results were modest compared to 
the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a dream come true, to get as much playing time as I wanted," Brinson 
said. "But things did not go right." 
</P>
<P>
Brinson carried three times for nine yards, caught three passes for 15 yards 
and returned three punts for eight yards. Those nine touches totaled 32 yards, 
not nearly enough to make up for the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way you can block them out is to make the play, make something 
happen, score a touchdown or get your team in position to score a touchdown," 
Brinson said. "Sometimes when that happens, things just continue to go bad 
because your are trying so hard to do something positive."

MANN WON'T PLAY FOR SDSU WOMEN THIS SEASON

Terri Mann, 1987 national girls' basketball player of the year while at Point 
Loma High School, will not play for the San Diego State women's team this 
season, first-year Coach Beth Burns said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said she met Aug. 28 with Mann, who would have been eligible to play for 
SDSU on Dec. 17, and dismissed her from the team. Burns said that Mann will 
retain her scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"She needs to get her life in order," Burns said. "She has to get her physical 
situation and her scholastic situation in order before she can contribute to 
the team. She has to go to school and prove to herself and to me that she wants 
to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Mann still has not completely rehabilitated from a knee injury suffered after 
just 12 games at Western Kentucky last season. She underwent her second 
reconstructive knee surgery April 6 after transferring to SDSU last December. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said it is possible Mann will play for the Aztecs next season. 
</P>
<P>
"If Terri goes through the year and maintains her academics, she knows she can 
approach me and say she's ready to try out," Burns said. "And it would be a 
tryout situation -- she'd have to prove she could play." 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who led Point Loma to four consecutive state championships, was named 
California girls' player of the year in both 1986 and 1987 by Cal-Hi Sports 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Burns spent the last half-hour of Sunday's two-hour practice -- her first -- 
looking over walk-on prospects. Burns said that because she only has eight 
players on the roster, she will hold practices open to interested SDSU students 
all week.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU SOCCER GOALIE BREAKS SCHOOL SHUTOUT RECORD IN 
5-0 AZTEC VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
* Goalie Brian Finnerty broke San Diego State's all-time soccer shutout record 
in Sunday's 5-0 victory at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Finnerty, with 22.5 
shutouts, moved past Mark Stepovich, who had 21.5. 
</P>
<P>
The game was a scoreless tie at halftime, but the Aztecs (10-3-1) broke loose 
with goals by Eric Wynalda (two), Brian Craft-Negrete (two) and Andy Morroney. 
</P>
<P>
* The University of San Diego entered the top 20 for the first time in its 
history last Monday but has since lost two in a row, the latest s 2-1 loss to 
Washington in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Bianchi put the Toreros (11-4, No. 18) in front some 16 minutes into the 
game, but Washington scored 10 minutes later and again late in the second half 
to pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. International went into overtime with Denver in Colorado before dropping 
its 13th game of the year, 3-1. The Gulls (2-13) got their lone score from Mark

<P>
Andino, who did not make it out of Saturday's qualifying rounds, went into the 
event with what appeared to be an insurmountable lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lambresi needed almost all of the 1,800 second-place points to unseat Andino 
and claim his third title as many years. Lambresi finished with 7,583 points to 
Andino's 7,564.

HOW POOR WERE LOST IN SHUFFLE OF O.C. RENEWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several years ago, when redevelopment of Santa Ana's Civic Center began, blocks 
of houses occupied by low-income families were razed. In their place have 
sprung up multistory apartments and condominiums designed for government 
workers, office buildings and senior citizen housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The poor were displaced -- by a policy that was hardly an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first priority, said Robert Hoffman, Santa Ana's redevelopment 
manager, was not housing but economic revitalization of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Building housing that is affordable for the poor has never been a high priority 
in Orange County, where local governments have frequently ignored mechanisms to 
promote such housing or have adopted policies adding to housing costs. Many of 
these decisions have been made in the last five years, a time when the number 
of county homeless has doubled to about 10,000 people, according to the Orange 
County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
A Times review of local housing policies found that: 
</P>
<P>
* Many cities, including those working to provide lower-cost housing, have 
piled on development fees for schools, parks, libraries and other amenities 
that have boosted the cost of all housing, helping to put most out of reach for 
low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
* Although all local governments are under state mandate to update the housing 
components of their general plans, a planner reviewing the documents for the 
state said few county localities are doing anything substantial about producing 
more low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite the Legislature's instruction that some money from redevelopment 
agencies be put aside for housing, county cities were sitting on millions of 
dollars meant to be spent on housing. Redevelopment revenue has instead paid 
for glitzy commercial developments or built new streets, sewers and water 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Some county cities do have active housing programs. Irvine, for example, set a 
goal of providing 12.5% of all new housing for households of very low incomes. 
Anaheim is making vigorous use of density bonuses in building low-cost housing 
for senior citizens and families. And Garden Grove is in the midst of a 
$25-million program to rehabilitate and build housing for low-income families 
in Buena Clinton, a poverty pocket in the city's southeast. 
</P>
<P>
But fees designed to enhance quality of life have helped to drive up the cost 
of new homes in some of these cities and elsewhere. And while affordable 
housing advocates insist that higher-density develop ment is needed to 
counteract the astronomical price of real estate in the county, some local 
governments have been reluctant to adopt higher-density zoning, partly for fear 
that it would worsen traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, the issue of affordable housing has taken a back seat to 
quality-of-life issues" in the county, said Joe Carreras, senior housing 
planner at the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Preserving "quality of life" in too many instances has meant keeping 
lower-income residents away by refusing to allow construction of new apartments 
they could afford, housing advocates contend. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Agid, a principal in the Marketing Department, an Irvine-based real estate 
consulting firm, said: "For years cities (in the county) have practiced elitist 
zoning because they don't want the transient population that is attributed to 
apartments within their communities." 
</P>
<P>
Even some condominium projects with more affordable units have been rejected. 
In Seal Beach, a plan calling for construction of condominiums that would sell 
for an "affordable" $120,000 to $150,000 was recently scuttled to appease 
residents who said the units would be "too small and wouldn't attract the 
proper element of people," said Ed Knight, the city's former director of 
development services. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council approved building 355 homes, expected to sell for more 
than half a million dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
The local governments of the county have missed many chances to develop more 
effective strategies to solve the problem of providing housing for citizens on 
welfare or in lower-paying jobs, housing advocates said. Often, the governments 
seem to have given up on the task, saying it is hopeless without much state and 
federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Brower, publisher of a newsletter that monitors the county's real estate 
industry, wrote that because of spiraling inflation and other factors, building 
low-cost housing in the county has probably become a futile objective. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it is time to drop the subject," Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
One method available to local governments to encourage lower-cost housing -- 
density bonuses -- has been applied much more vigorously in some cities than in 
others. The practice entitles developers of affordable housing to build more 
units to the acre than local zoning would otherwise permit. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, for example, only recently did the City Council adopt a plan to 
grant a density bonus -- after council members were advised that the state has 
mandated such bonuses for a decade. Furthermore, Fullerton has refused to use 
federal community block grant money or any other government funding to develop 
lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been the council's position that private industry should take the lead 
in solving the housing problem," city redevelopment manager Terry M. Glavin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
William Andrews, a planner reviewing local housing plans for the state 
Department of Housing and Community Development, believes that county cities 
"for the most part are just letting the housing problem roll out to the 
hinterlands." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the exodus of low-paid workers to San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties for apartments they can afford. By contrast, Andrews said, 
"in Northern California there has been more of a pulling together of concerned 
local governments, housing advocates and industry focusing on the problems." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Orange County to Los Angeles and Northern California, housing 
advocates note that the county has spawned far fewer nonprofit developers of 
low-cost housing, for which they blame a shortage of financial support and 
cooperation from local government and private industry. Nonprofit developers 
are preferred over for-profit developers in competing for state and federal 
subsidies for low-cost housing, said Marc Brown, staff attorney for the 
California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation and a low-income housing lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
He said this preference occurs in part because nonprofits commit to maintaining 
the housing they develop as "affordable." By contrast, for-profit developers 
say they will convert affordable apartments to market rate at the end of their 
government contracts, which usually run about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Housing experts say there are 40 to 50 nonprofit housing development 
corporations in Los Angeles County and about 175 in the Bay Area. Orange County 
has had two active private, nonprofit developers: the Civic Center Barrio 
Housing Corp. in Santa Ana and the Orange County Community Development Corp. 
Neither has produced low-income housing in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. has built 64 condominiums and apartments 
in the last nine years. The Orange County Community Housing Corp. has built 52 
apartments since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County once was a reluctant leader in providing affordable housing. 
Under pressure from state and federal agencies and housing advocacy groups, the 
County Board of Supervisors in 1979 became one of the first local governments 
in California to require part of all new housing to be built for low- to 
moderate-income people. That resulted in many new affordable houses and 
apartments in the county's unincorporated region. 
</P>
<P>
But builders strongly opposed the mandatory requirements. In 1983, the Board of 
Supervisors canceled them, contending that free-market forces would adequately 
address the housing needs of low-to-moderate-income groups. 
</P>
<P>
That did not happen, however. Released from the county requirement, developers 
were driven by profit opportunities, market demand and changes in tax laws to 
build fewer apartments and more expensive homes for the county's upwardly 
mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Housing Authority for more than a year has had $4 million 
available to loan at below-market interest rates to developers of low-cost 
housing. Just 40 low-cost units have so far been financed under the loan 
program. Housing authority executive director Sandra McClymonds said developers 
"are not lining up" for the loans, apparently because such housing is not as 
profitable as market-rate units. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, county housing officials insist that because the mandatory 
requirements were eliminated, the county has far exceeded its goals for 
low-cost housing, because builders have produced 10,014 such homes, many more 
than the target of 5,660. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is the county's definition of affordable housing, the county's 
critics said. The county defines affordable as within the means of households 
earning up to 120% of the county's median income, which it says is $51,709 -- 
substantially higher than the $46,900-a-year median income projected by the 
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
So, to the dismay of advocates for the poor, the county considers as affordable 
housing that is within the means of households earning up to $62,050 a year. It 
sets no goal for providing housing for very-low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Forbath, director of Share Our Selves, a nonprofit service organization in 
Costa Mesa, said the people she deals with "are lucky if they make $8,000 to 
$10,000 a year. . . . Quite often I am working with a single mother with a 
child or two. They are living in motels and parks and doubling and tripling up 
and renting rooms and garages." 
</P>
<P>
Housing officials report extreme overcrowding in the older neighborhoods of 
Santa Ana and some northern county cities. In enforcing housing codes, Santa 
Ana officials frequently report finding 10 or more people sharing one bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a county home has soared to $237,900 -- contrasted with a 
$91,600 median home price for the nation -- forcing some families with 
substantial incomes to stay in the apartment market. There they compete with 
the poor for the county's rental stock, pushing rents even higher. 
</P>
<P>
Lower-priced apartments -- $500 to $700 for a one-bedroom and $550 to $750 for 
a two-bedroom -- are so scarce, said Bill Kraus, executive vice president of 
the Apartment Assn. of Orange County, that they are snatched up 24 to 48 hours 
after they are advertised.

MAN ARRESTED IN THE DEATH OF HIS BABY NEPHEW 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old man was arrested in the death of his baby nephew, who died Sunday 
after an 18-hour struggle on life support systems. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Robert Corwin Jr. surrendered to police Sunday outside a Pacific Bell 
administration and operations center in Tustin about 4:30 a.m., about seven 
hours after the 18-month-old baby -- who was no longer breathing -- was 
discovered by his parents, Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Darryl Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory F. Negri and his wife, Cheryl Negri, had gone out Saturday night, and 
left Corwin to watch their two children, Thomas and a 3-year-old daughter, at 
their Fountain Valley home. When the couple returned about 10 p.m., they found 
Corwin missing and Thomas lying lifeless in his crib, Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
Nance said the infant was either strangled or suffocated. Police found "red 
marks around the baby's neck consistent with strangulation," Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old girl was not harmed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police eventually trailed Corwin, who is Cheryl Negri's brother, to the Pacific 
Bell facility in Tustin, where he reportedly worked as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of murder. Bail was set 
at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Negri found her son and called for help shortly after 10 p.m., Nance 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was frantic," Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Had Been Critical 
</P>
<P>
The baby had stopped breathing and had no pulse when paramedics arrived at the 
family's home in the 17000 block of Walnut Street. The child was resuscitated 
and taken to Humana Hospital-Huntington Beach and later transferred to 
Childrens Hospital of Orange County in Orange, where he remained in critical 
condition throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very grave," said Frank Negri Jr., the infant's grandfather, as he paced 
earlier in the day outside the hospital's intensive care unit. Negri was one of 
several somber family members, including the infant's young parents, gathered 
in a tiny lobby on the hospital's fifth-floor, waiting for news of the baby's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too tough (to) talk," the grandfather said softly. "It is so tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the doctors' efforts, the baby died at about 5:45 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities would not speculate on a motive for the attack. The suspect 
reportedly had been discharged recently from the U.S. Navy, but it is not known 
why he was released, Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Gregory Negri had moved with his wife and two children into the 
modest, single-story home on the corner of Walnut and La Colonia streets about 
six months ago. In recent weeks, Corwin had often been seen around the house. 
Several neighbors thought that Corwin may have been living with the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sirens Blaring 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor who was home Saturday night said what unfolded outside the Negri's 
house Saturday night "was something out of a TV cop show." 
</P>
<P>
With sirens blaring, several patrol cars, a paramedic unit and an ambulance 
descended on the neighborhood, about a block north of Slater Avenue just west 
of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
When the Negris returned home, Corwin's car was in the driveway, but he was not 
in the house. By the time paramedics and police arrived, the Corwin's car was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that he had worked or was working in some capacity at the Pac Bell 
facility, so we put out the word," said Nance, adding that the couple alerted 
police that Corwin was probably armed with a small-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
About 2:30 a.m., Tustin police spotted Corwin's car with the rifle inside at 
the telephone center at the corner of Red Hill and Edinger avenues. More than 
1,000 people, including operators, work at the facility, but the last shift on 
Saturday ended at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Police searched the grounds around the facility, but did not enter the 
building, Nance said. About two hours later, Corwin called Tustin police and 
said he wanted to surrender. About 4:30 a.m., he walked out of the building and 
was arrested.

SCHOOLS WITH PRIVATE FUNDING OPEN FIRST

<P>
Officials in the Saddleback school district are finding that when private 
developers and homeowners pay, new schools get built. When the state pays, 
construction waits. 
</P>
<P>
Two new elementary schools were scheduled to open in the fall, but only the one 
paid for directly by local residents will open on time, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on Eastlake II Elementary in Rancho Santa Margarita is expected to 
begin this month, paid for by a special school tax in that neighborhood. 
Construction of Pittsford Elementary in El Toro, to be paid for by the state, 
is on hold until state money is available. 
</P>
<P>
More than $75 million in new elementary schools and an intermediate school are 
planned for opening in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District by 1994. 
Most will be paid for directly by the residents who live in new housing 
developments and pay a special school tax as part of their property tax. 
</P>
<P>
The tax district was established in an agreement with the area's home builder, 
the Santa Margarita Co., before residents moved into the new community, said 
Bill Manahan, the district's business director. To provide schools, the school 
board sold bonds, which will be paid off through the additional tax to 
community residents. The tax charged to each depends on the value of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Schools paid for by the state are on hold because money from a $400-million 
school bond approved by California voters in 1988 ran out in July. With $700 
million in school buildings waiting to be funded statewide, the state may ask 
voters to approve a $1-billion school bond next year, Manahan said.

DELEGATE ASSAILS O.C. POLITICIANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Taxation without representation is tyranny! And the fact is, these gentlemen 
attempt to govern without the consent of the governed." 
</P>
<P>
The irate speaker is no 18th-Century firebrand. He is Walter E. Fauntroy, the 
nattily dressed delegate who represents the District of Columbia in Congress. 
And the gentlemen to whom he refers are not long-dead English monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
They are Orange County's own William E. Dannemeyer and Robert K. Dornan, 
Fauntroy's colleagues in the House of Representatives and, in his view, 
egregious meddlers. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Dornan (R-Garden Grove) brought on Fauntroy's 
pique last week during an exceptionally emotional House debate over the 
$538-million appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
At issue were religious freedom, home rule for the district, homosexual rights 
and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime foe of homosexuality, Dannemeyer led a successful floor fight to 
rewrite a section of the district's human rights ordinance to allow Roman 
Catholic Georgetown University to withhold formal recognition from campus gay 
rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan had earlier tried, but failed, to persuade the House to prohibit within 
the district the use of public funds to perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither Dornan nor Dannemeyer are on the House District of Columbia 
Committee, they offered no apologies for their efforts to influence district 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a cause, you fight on any battlefield presented," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
Fauntroy, he said, "should understand that, having fought through the civil 
rights battles. You look for your best target." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer said: "The truth of the matter is that Congress does have the 
authority under the Constitution to direct the activities of the District of 
Columbia. If we have that power and don't exercise it, we are in fact condoning 
what has taken place." 
</P>
<P>
The battle has raised questions about the extent to which Congress should exert 
its constitutional authority over the affairs of the district. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution grants Congress the power to "exercise exclusive legislation, 
in all cases whatsoever, over such District as may . . . become the seat of 
government of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
However, Congress has relinquished some authority over the years by permitting 
residents of the district to elect their own mayor, City Council and a delegate 
to Congress. Fauntroy, the delegate, does not have full voting power. 
</P>
<P>
The case involving Georgetown University pitted the elected City Council 
against conservatives in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Jesuits who run Georgetown had refused to recognize homosexual 
groups seeking the use of school money and facilities. But the school was 
forced to reach an accommodation with the groups after the D.C. Court of 
Appeals ruled that the city's tough Human Rights Act, enacted by the council, 
bars discrimination based on sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress passed legislation, introduced by conservative Sen. William 
L. Armstrong (R-Colo.), directing the D.C. council to rewrite its human rights 
law to permit religious institutions to discriminate against groups who violate 
tenets of their religion. But a court held the congressional action to violate 
the free-speech rights of the council members. 
</P>
<P>
This year, both houses adopted a new version of the Armstrong amendment that 
changed district law directly, through an act of Congress, bypassing the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is Dannemeyer who usually makes headlines with his campaign against 
homosexual life styles, it was Dornan's rhetoric that proved most colorful 
during last week's debate. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan spoke after liberal Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) recalled the 
days when churches were allowed to discriminate against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
When Dornan rose to speak, he recounted his own past work in the civil rights 
movement, registering black voters in Mississippi and Alabama during the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The road to Selma did not lead to the road to sodomy," Dornan said. "That we 
would come to a day . . . that we would equate Afro-American heritage . . . 
with sodomy, it's a crazy day in this House." 
</P>
<P>
ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
"Taxation without representation is tyranny! And the fact is, these gentlemen 
attempt to govern without the consent of the governed."

SORTING OUT WHO'S IN AND OUT OF TOWN

Rand and Leslie Hogan have an Anaheim home address -- in Stanton. They are not 
alone in this confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked into Stanton's zigzagging border, which takes about a dozen jogs into 
Garden Grove and Anaheim, are residents who have no idea that they are 
official, taxpaying residents of Stanton, according to Mike Bouvier, the city's 
planning manager. 
</P>
<P>
For convenience's sake, the Postal Service has given these pockets Garden Grove 
and Anaheim ZIP codes, even though they are pieces of Stanton. With the ZIP 
designations come corresponding Garden Grove or Anaheim mailing addresses, 
Bouvier said. 
</P>
<P>
The twists and turns of Stanton's boundaries are the result of what Bouvier 
called an "incorporation boom" throughout much of Orange and Los Angeles 
counties that began in the 1950s. In the decade or so that followed, the 
incorporations and land grabs left many area maps looking like patchwork 
quilts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About three square miles of real estate became Stanton when it incorporated in 
1956. 
</P>
<P>
Bad enough that residents are confused. Stanton Mayor Edward L. Allen wanted to 
make sure recently that the Census Bureau wasn't. That could cost. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau will soon begin its national census. That survey of age, income, 
residency and other statistics is the basis for distribution of billions of 
federal and state dollars to local communities. The more residents, the more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"I's a significant issue," said Rand Hogan, a member of Stanton's Community 
Affairs Committee, a group of residents and business representatives appointed 
by the City Council to help promote participation in the upcoming census. 
</P>
<P>
When a Census Bureau representative recently appeared before the Stanton City 
Council to ask cooperation with the head count, Mayor Allen asked how the 
bureau intended to sort through the mess created by the city's erratic 
boundary. How would the bureau categorize a person who lives and pays taxes in 
Stanton, Allen wondered, but whose mailing address is in Anaheim or Garden 
Grove? 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Tafoya, the Santa Ana district manager for the Census Bureau, assured 
the mayor that the system is designed to handle such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Even before census questionnaires are sent to residents, Tafoya said later, 
census people canvass communities. Using current city maps, these canvassers 
mark the exact geographic location of each residence to pinpoint what housing 
is within which city boundary. From this door-to-door survey of "what's 
actually on the ground," Tafoya said, the bureau compiles lists that are 
cross-referenced to mailing addresses. 
</P>
<P>
"When we mail the questionnaires, they go to the address provided," Tafoya 
said, but in the tabulation process, the real city of residence is recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some other pockets" such as the ones in Stanton, he said. "The 
system's set up pretty much to take care of them." PEGGY HESKETH

<P>
A group of Westminster residents opposed to the recently passed ordinance 
banning fireworks in the city has submitted more than 6,000 signatures to City 
Hall seeking a referendum on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster Citizens for a Safe and Responsible Fourth of July, a group 
composed of local civic clubs and individuals, formed soon after the ordinance 
was passed on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We began getting organized and having meetings the next week after the 
decision on the ban was made," Cathy Zoellner, leader of the group, said. "We 
feel this is an issue that the citizens should have a say on." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance automatically was suspended when the signatures were submitted. 
If city officials verify that 3,734 of the signatures are those of registered 
voters, a special election will be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that they banned the fireworks because of safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only about six or seven other cities in the county that still allow 
them," said City Clerk Mary Lou Morey. "So the city took that seriously into 
account when it voted on the ban."

MAN FATALLY SHOT IN MOTORISTS' DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was killed late Saturday night after he and his brother-in-law got into a 
dispute with other motorists, who apparently opened fire with a handgun, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian DeLeon, 25, of Santa Ana was pronounced dead on arrival at Coastal 
Communities Hospital in Santa Ana, where he was rushed by his brother-in-law, 
who was driving the car in which DeLeon was shot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to identify DeLeon's 16-year-old brother-in-law. He and DeLeon 
were driving east on Edinger Avenue, near Center Street, when they got into an 
argument with motorists in a dark-colored car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The dark-colored car dropped back in traffic briefly and moments later four or 
five shots were fired from a pistol. One of the bullets struck DeLeon in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Although police were not disclosing the nature of the dispute that provoked the 
incident, detectives said they do not believe that the shooting was related to 
gang activity.

4 HONORED AS TOP '89 PUBLIC EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four Newport Beach public safety officers have been selected to receive 
employee-of-the-year awards, one of the highest honors their departments can 
bestow for outstanding public service. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Police Department has named Thomas Voth, 36, of Orange as 
Officer of the Year for 1989. Voth, a 12-year police veteran, is one of three 
officers on the force who work with police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
He and his partner, a 5-year-old German shepherd named Hondo, are credited with 
field work and searches that have resulted in several arrests. Department 
officials also praised Voth for his work with Neighborhood Watch organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Voth was selected for consistent and outstanding teamwork," Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said. "He is always there when you need him, and he always does a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Named Firefighter of the Year was Richard D. Middlebrough, 42, of Laguna 
Niguel. Middlebrough, a 14-year veteran, is part of the department's videotape 
unit at its headquarters and president of the Newport Beach Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have fun doing my job, and that's about it," Middlebrough said. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard of the Year honors went to Mike Halphide, 24, of Yorba Linda, a 
recent graduate of UC Irvine. Halphide, who has been a seasonal lifeguard since 
1984, is credited with hundreds of rescues. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an all-round great guy and has done every job that's been handed to 
him," Marine Safety Officer Mitchell White said. "He's one of the leaders down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Kleeman, 46, of Huntington Beach has been 
named Harbor Patrolman of the Year for his contributions to training exercises 
involving marine firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
Kleeman, a 17-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was praised 
particularly for a joint exercise with the Newport Beach Fire Department to 
assess firefighting capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Voth, Middlebrough, Halphide, and Kleeman were honored Saturday night at a 
dinner-dance hosted by the Newport Harbor American Legion. DAN WEIKEL

LOWER RATES, BIGGER ROLE FOR MORTGAGE BANKERS FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James S. Granelli, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since a federal law restructured the savings and loan industry in August, 
industry experts have debated its effect on mortgage interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have argued that S&amp;Ls, the major home lender nationwide, would raise 
loan rates and fees as they try to meet new requirements for higher capital 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have argued that competition from banks and mortgage companies would 
prevent S&amp;Ls from changing their rates much. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas T. Hammond figures the era of the mortgage banker is upon us, and that 
S&amp;Ls no longer enter into the home loan equation. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman and president of the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banking 
firm operating in four states, Hammond sees some new trends in the mortgage and 
housing markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond is an outspoken industry executive who has wrangled with S&amp;L 
regulators during his aborted effort to buy a Riverside thrift last year. He 
also is keeping an eye on Fidelity National Financial Inc., an Irvine title 
insurer that has been gobbling up so much Hammond Co. stock that it has become 
the second-largest shareholder with a 23.6% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week with Times staff writer James S. Granelli, Hammond 
discussed what he believes is happening in Orange County's mortgage and housing 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. In what direction are mortgage rates likely to go in the next few months? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, it's difficult to forecast interest rates, but I think in the 
intermediate term, say, to the end of the first quarter, rates are going lower. 
But it appears there's a very good bull market in bonds -- in the 30-year fixed 
mortgage markets -- so I expect rates will be sliding down a little. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Under the S&amp;L bailout bill, mortgage companies were expected to turn up 
the heat, forcing savings and loans to hold mortgage rates down, or, at least, 
not increase them very much. Has that happened? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's beginning to happen. You have to understand that mortgage bankers have 
had between 25% and 35% of the residential loan origination market in this 
country. During the last five years, until the bailout bill, mortgage bankers 
have had a tougher road. Their share of the market dropped because the thrifts 
could lend money -- and did lend money -- without regard to capital market 
rates, without regard to what they were going to do with these assets and 
without regard to their net worth requirements. That explained why the thrifts 
dramatically increased their assets over the past five or six years. It was 
their attempt to get well. Obviously the plan failed. Now they're in a 
retrenching situation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So now you're gaining the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
A. As the mortgage industry starts coming closer together with respect to 
rates, mortgage bankers have a distinct advantage. As a mortgage banker, I 
consider our primary competition in the next period of time not to be the 
thrifts -- they're done and gone, with respect to being competitors of ours -- 
but the commercial banks. Just this past quarter, for the first time in a long 
time, the commercial banks originated more mortgages than the thrifts. So the 
commercial banks are going into the mortgage business in a big way. In fact, 
our company now finds itself selling to some of these major commercial banks. 
But it's our time now, and I think our share of the market has gone up in the 
past year, and I think it will continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we'll probably get up to 35% or 40% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is your competition from commercial banks coming mainly from the large banks 
or from the local banks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Bank of America, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan. They are the players today. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Didn't the bailout law affect mortgage rates by rather quickly moving them 
up? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes it did. There was an immediate impact when it became clear that thrifts 
would need much more capital. It was interesting that the big California 
lenders were the dominant ARM (adjustable-rate mortgage) lenders and were 
really succeeding because of teaser (introductory) rates and fees. They were 
killing the rest of the industry, dominating it. The minute it became clear 
what the capital requirements for S&amp;Ls were going to be, they knew they 
were not going to be able to sell these below market mortgages. They instantly 
raised their rates and fees. That put them in an extreme competitive position 
with everybody else. This was certainly the case with Home Savings and, to some 
extent, Great Western and the other major thrifts that were the power players 
in the teaser rate ARM business. 
</P>
<P>
Q. There doesn't seem to be such a thing as teaser rates any more. Aren't 
introductory rates for adjustable-rate mortgages almost the same as fixed rates 
right now? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. We can't sell an ARM loan. I don't think last month that we did more 
than a handful of ARM loans, and I don't know why we did those. They're not 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the lack of low teaser rates a major reason for the slowdown in buying? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think not. Housing cycles have definite characteristics. One must remember 
that from 1980 to 1985 we had very little new supply of housing coming on the 
market. The people who did avail themselves to housing during that period, both 
new and resale, were buried in high-rate loans. They really needed to buy a 
house. There was a move or some compelling reason. The discretionary buyer left 
the market during that period of time. Interest rates fell dramatically 
beginning in 1986. And we had a tremendous pent-up demand from people who 
hadn't made a housing decision for four years. Plus, we had a whole group of 
families buried in high-rate mortgages. So, 1987 was the highest year ever for 
residential mortgages. It's the only time America has had $450 billion in 
mortgages. This year we'll do somewhere between $325 billion and $350 billion, 
to give you an indication. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So we created a tremendous housing boom. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. We had this pent-up demand, plus we've had a very strong California 
economy -- new jobs, new migration, immigration, Pacific Rim business and so 
forth. It appears to me now that two things have happened. We've sort of 
satisfied the demand and the economic job creation that's been going on is 
still going on, but not at the accelerated rate we have had in the past three 
years. So this housing boom may be maturing, and that's part of a normal 
process. I don't think it's going to collapse and I don't think it's going to 
become as bad as '82, '83, '84. But it certainly has matured and it's running 
out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If adjustable loans were used in the last five years to make it easier for 
people to qualify for loans, is it harder now? 
</P>
<P>
A. You have to understand the way the balance sheet of the typical American 
family has changed over the past five years. I'm not sure it's harder. It's 
just the reflection of the new realities of what a family's financial situation 
is today. Those basic changes are that it's almost unusual today that we have a 
family with a single income. We have two incomes in every household -- that's 
almost universal. The second thing that we've found -- and we operate in four 
states and we do between 300 and 500 single-family home loans a month -- is 
that 30% of all of our loans have non-married co-borrowers; that is, people 
cannot afford these houses without a parent, an uncle, a friend or somebody 
else coming into the deal. I would say that five years ago, we would not have 
had 5% of our mortgages like this. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So the loss of teaser rates isn't affecting home buyers' ability to qualify 
for loans? 
</P>
<P>
A. Perhaps. Housing is taking on different aspects and characteristics than it 
has in previous periods. The ARM business -- the cheap teaser rate business -- 
allowed people over the last four or five years to get into housing they 
otherwise could not afford. This was just another way of the lending industry 
turning its back on underwriting. It was just a rationalization to get more 
business. In some regions of the country, it's been an economic disaster 
because the people who qualified on teaser rates have turned out to be unable 
to pay at higher rates. What we really should be concerned about is that 
there's a general deflation under way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Aren't some places going down in value already? 
</P>
<P>
A. In California, we have a very odd situation. It's hard to say whether our 
prices have leveled or are falling. Between 1981 and '83-'84 we did have very 
definitive deflation in housing. It caused tremendous delinquencies, previously 
unheard of in California. I don't think we're to that stage yet, but we 
certainly have been through it before and we're seeing symptoms on the East 
Coast now, certainly in the Southwest, certainly in many parts of the Midwest. 
We're seeing tremendous problems in Arizona -- real genuine deflation going on 
there with falling house prices. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Even in California, there are reports of home prices declining. Are prices 
able to fall without genuine concern over deflation? 
</P>
<P>
A. This is the way I would characterize it. In Orange County, August last year 
to August this year, the number of new and resale houses sold, according to 
your paper, is down 28%. That's a significant drop. As I recall, the '87 to '88 
numbers were down 16%. So we've had two years of declining units despite this 
seemingly extraordinary housing boom. What's happening is that we have an 
imbalance in the housing market. What we've really enjoyed is a new-home sales 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you mean? 
</P>
<P>
A. Prices in the resale markets in Orange County and most areas of Southern 
California are much lower than in the new home market for a couple of reasons. 
As we've developed this tremendous economy in Southern California, we've 
developed affordability bands. If you have a house listed today in Orange 
County in any reasonable area at, say, $200,000 or below, the market is fairly 
brisk. If you're in the $250,000 to $400,000 range, we are accumulating 
inventory at the moment. The higher end of the market, above $400,000, always 
seems to have a life of its own. It sort of defies trends. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Have housing prices peaked right now? 
</P>
<P>
A. At this point, I think we have brought just enough product to the market. I 
think we've sort of met supply and demand. If we keep bringing new $350,000 
houses on the market in South Orange County at the rate we have for the past 
three years, yes, we will have surplus supply and we will have some softening. 
In fact, we're now figuring out ways to help our builder customers subsidize 
mortgages to get people into homes at these higher prices. That is the biggest 
product we are selling right now. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Could you explain that product? 
</P>
<P>
A. People all want 30-year fixed loans today. So builders will prepay interest 
to lenders to provide mortgages that will have, say, a 2-percentage-point lower 
interest rate for the first year, then 1 point lower for the second year and so 
on. There's a variety of combinations that they use, but it's a discount they 
offer to people to buy their houses. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Aren't the builders just asking more for the houses to cover the discounts? 
</P>
<P>
A. One never knows if that's coming out of their profit or they're raising the 
prices to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rather than moving, are people refinancing or taking out home equity loans 
to put on additions or refurbish their current homes? And are we seeing people 
sell their homes, buy lower-priced homes and put the difference into remodeling 
the new homes? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Absolutely. What is unique about the '88 and '89 housing cycle is that 
we don't have the house flipping that we used to have. Families used to pack up 
and move for a school district, for an extra bedroom or whatever. They would 
move up. We're not seeing that now because we've had this extraordinary 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And moving usually means buyers will pay higher taxes too. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. We have this damnable Proposition 13 tax (limitation) situation that is 
now a deterrent to moving. It used to be when your house inflated 20%, the 
difference in your property taxes was not a driving motivation. When your house 
is now worth 100% more than when you bought it, you're facing a major monthly 
cost increase if you sell and move. And that has now put a bite on families. 
Families will settle down and expand their houses. They all of a sudden get 
content with their local school districts. They're not moving. We used to think 
in terms of a 3-to-1 new market to resale market. Three resales for every new 
house. That is stretching out now, because people are not moving up. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you think the ratio is now -- 5 or 6 to one? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's approaching that. Just look at the realty board statistics in our 
communities in Orange County that are reported every Sunday in your paper and 
you'll see that these numbers are not like they were. And there are more people 
and more houses and more housing stock in these communities. The number of 
resales is declining despite an increase in housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Developers would say their costs are rising faster, causing this wide gap 
between new and resale house prices. Is that a major factor? 
</P>
<P>
A. Of course it is. But, and I'm not going to become political, it's becoming 
apparent that one of the worst things we did was enact this Proposition 13, and 
the irony is that builders and Realtors were real advocates of it. But now 
what's happened is that we've reorganized our tax base in this state. And the 
local communities and the local school districts are scrambling for revenues. 
They do not have the revenue base to provide the infrastructure to allow these 
communities to grow. So the result is that if the community wants to expand, it 
must sock the new home buyers -- they're not socking the builders -- with the 
cost of this infrastructure. The municipalities have been permanently impaired 
by this tax limitation. There's going to be more and more awareness of this 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You think we'll see a Prop. 13 change some day? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. We must.

HIGHWAY 101 HOPES ALBUM 3 IS UP TO SPEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curtis Stone had a double case of the jitters last Monday night in Nashville -- 
one for himself and one for his dad. 
</P>
<P>
It was awards night for the Nashville-based Country Music Assn., the annual 
televised ceremonies in which the kudos-conscious country music business 
distributes degrees of honor and prestige among its top-echelon acts. 
</P>
<P>
Stone says he was edgy, and a bit doubtful, about the prospects that his band, 
Highway 101, would be voted country music's top group for the second straight 
year. But, speaking over the phone from Nashville last week, the Highway 101 
bassist said he was even more nervous about what would happen with his father. 
</P>
<P>
Cliffie Stone, a longtime presence on the Southern California country scene as 
a musician, radio and television host and song publisher, was being considered 
for election to the Country Music Hall of Fame, vying against four other 
nominees in the Hall's non-performing category. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of the Year award came first, and Highway 101, which plays tonight 
and Tuesday at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana , won it again over a 
field that included the Desert Rose Band, Shenandoah, Restless Heart and 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Stone was returning to his seat after a photo and interview session 
outside the hall when he heard the Hall-of-Fame presentation being announced 
with the usual biographical preamble. 
</P>
<P>
"(The announcer) was talking about this guy who did 14,000 television shows and 
25,000 radio shows. I said, 'I guess dad didn't get it.' I had no idea he had 
done that many." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking two days after the awards night, Stone said he still hadn't had a 
proper chance, amid all the awards-week bustle, to give his father proper 
congratulations on his Hall of Fame honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really been able to sit down and express how proud I am of him, but 
he knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Cliffie Stone, who grew up in Burbank, started playing stand-up bass on the 
radio in 1932. He became emcee of his own Southland shows: "Wake Up Ranch" on 
radio, then "Hometown Jamboree," a country music television program that aired 
on KTLA from 1950 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Cliffie wasn't the first musical Stone. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather played bass and was a world champion banjo player for five 
years in a row," Curtis Stone said. "He was the comic relief of my dad's show. 
He went by the name Herman Hermit. He looked like a hobo, with real long hair 
and a real long beard. In the '50s, that was pretty rad. He would make musical 
instruments out of car bumpers and vacuum cleaners." 
</P>
<P>
Cliffie Stone, now 72, taught his son his first guitar chords, but Curtis says 
that while his father always offered guidance, he didn't try to push him into 
any musical line. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a lot of rock in high school. Then my dad said, 'I've got a job for 
you. I can put you together with this girl who is going to go out and play 
rodeos.' He said that in country music, you'll always be able to work for a 
long, long time, but the rock thing might only last a year." 
</P>
<P>
Given his origins, it is natural enough that the younger Stone, 39, would wind 
up with a high-profile spot in country music. But his band's origins are not 
quite so organic. Highway 101 is not a group of old comrades who slogged their 
way up through the bars and honky-tonks. Instead, it was the creation of a 
Colorado-based music business manager, Chuck Morris, who had the concept for 
the group before there was a group. 
</P>
<P>
"He had this idea of putting together a country band with a girl singer," Stone 
said. Morris, who also manages the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Desert Rose Band 
and Leo Kottke, found his singer, Paulette Carlson, via an unsolicited tape. 
Carlson, originally from Minnesota, had tried to establish herself as a solo 
performer in Nashville during the early 1980s, but without much success. 
</P>
<P>
Morris teamed Carlson with veteran drummer Scott (Cactus) Moser. Stone says he 
entered the picture because Jerry Cariaga, a songwriting partner of his, knew 
Carlson and put in a strong word of recommendation. After the three had 
auditioned several other musicians, Stone brought in guitarist Jack Daniels, an 
old performing buddy from California. 
</P>
<P>
Highway 101's first release, a pop-flavored single for Warner Bros., turned out 
to be a commercial flop. "They said 'We'll release another song, and if that 
doesn't work, you're dead,' " Stone said. "We decided to add a steel guitar and 
be more country. That's kind of what made the difference." Recording with a 
more traditional approach, Highway 101 came up with "The Bed You Made for Me," 
an autobiographical song that Carlson had written about being betrayed by a 
former flame. 
</P>
<P>
With Highway 101 barely rolling up the on-ramp of success (at that point, it 
existed only as a studio band), Stone said he began thinking about finishing 
his college degree and finding a more reliable means of support as an English 
teacher or music instructor. But that changed when "The Bed You Made for Me" 
became a hit in the spring of 1987, rising to No. 4 on the Billboard country 
chart. Since then, Highway 101 has cruised along nicely, notching seven more 
Top 10 country singles (including three No. 1 hits -- "Cry, Cry, Cry," 
"Somewhere Tonight," and "(Do You Love Me) Just Say Yes") and back-to-back 
group-of-the-year awards from both of country music's major industry groups, 
the Country Music Assn. and the Los Angeles-based Academy of Country Music. 
</P>
<P>
The band has just released its third and most traditional-sounding album, 
"Paint the Town." While honky-tonk predominates, the album still shows glimmers 
of the country-rock side of the band's personality. Thematically, "Paint the 
Town" offers a steady diet of heartbreak, although not of the soppy, 
tears-in-your-beer variety. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'Let's take a chance and do a lovelorn album,' " Stone said. "But 
there are no victims on the album. We're conscious of having (Carlson) come 
across as stronger than that. The (theme of) the first album was a woman not 
being a victim in love, taking a strong stance" -- a role that Carlson plays 
well by moving from classic country catch-in-the-throat hurt to a brassier, 
more insistent persona. 
</P>
<P>
Stone says that Highway 101 was too hurried on its 1988 album, "2," to consider 
the sort of thematic and stylistic unities that crop up on "Paint the Town." 
Group members had written or co-written four of the 10 songs on the band's 
first album -- a respectable creative showing in country music, where 
performers commonly rely on outside songwriters for material. On "2," all of 
the songs came from outside the band, except for one tune co-written by 
Carlson. Stone says the band's touring schedule hadn't allowed the members time 
to write. 
</P>
<P>
For "Paint the Town," he said, "we took time out to write and rehearse. Between 
the four of us, we wrote 20 songs for this record, of which two made the album. 
I can safely say it's a little disappointing for all of us when we don't get 
particular songs we believe in on the record. But the bottom line is the final 
product. Everything is a little disappointing for about 10 minutes when the 
final decision is made." (Stone says song selections are made by a vote of 
Highway 101's members, its two producers, its management and its record 
company.) "Then the disappointment is over, and it's 'Let's get on, and for the 
next album let's have all original songs.' But they're going to have to hold up 
and fit in." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the strongest originals axed from "Paint the Town" might have tilted 
the album too far toward Highway 101's rocking side, Stone said, and not 
blended well with the record's traditional emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very easy for us to go one way or another, to go out and be real 
straight-ahead rock, or straight-ahead country," he said. "But the band was 
cognizant of not doing anything outside of what we do. The third album is 
critical -- it could make or break us." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate goal, Stone said, is for Highway 101 to move up from its status 
as a show-opener for some of country's biggest names and begin headlining the 
larger theaters on its own. But that push will have to wait until next year. 
After a few more dates, the band is going to stay off the highway for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rough time to take off with the album just coming out. But we haven't 
really been off in three years," said Stone, who lives in San Diego with his 
wife, a law student. "This will be our first real break. Paula's getting 
married (to an Alaskan developer), and she wants to take off, and the rest of 
us just want to get home. I'm going to take my dogs to the beach and probably 
write some songs."

LAGUNA HOMAGE TO PIONEER DAN LUTZ PROVES EVOCATIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the things the Laguna Art Museum does best is to remind us of minor but 
worthy Southern California artists whose vision helped shape the tone of the 
fledgling art scene during the early decades of this century. 
</P>
<P>
One of these figures is Dan Lutz, who came to Los Angeles in 1932 from Illinois 
to teach at USC. In a pocket-size exhibit at the museum (through Dec. 31), a 
portrait by his friend, Paul Sample, shows Lutz playing his bassoon with an air 
of fierce concentration, his brows arched and a shock of hair working its way 
loose above his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Although the setting seems to be his home (a woman -- his wife Dorothy? -- can 
be seen cooking in the kitchen), the wiry artist is neatly turned out in a suit 
and tie. In a self-portrait a year or so earlier, Lutz, 26, favored the 
dun-colored beret and open blue work shirt of the artist-proletariat. 
</P>
<P>
Lutz's mature work included scenes from everyday life, along with ecstatic, 
gestural paintings of gospel music-making. Although partial deafness kept him 
from a music career, Lutz's schooling included music-conservatory training as 
well as art school. A travel fellowship in Europe exposed him to contemporary 
art; he studied briefly in the studio of Andre Lhote, a French painter and art 
theoretician whose work was influenced by Cubism. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Lutz settled in Los Angeles, he had developed a moody vein of 
realism. In his 1936 painting, "Beach Scene," the sky is a sick yellow with an 
angry-looking black cloud, the ocean is a threatening blackish-blue and the 
crowd is sparse. 
</P>
<P>
A red passenger cart sits idle. On benches nearby, a pair of featureless old 
men prop themselves up at askew angles, and a whitefaced woman with a long nose 
tends to a baby who sits up in a carriage as stiffly as the subject of an 
American primitive painting. A tall, thin man in white stands off by himself, 
pinched and irresolute. This figure crops up in several of the paintings of 
this period, so it's tempting to see him as a self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
In "End of the Line," a watercolor from the next year, Lutz abstracts the 
shapes of pairs of idle trolley cars into pale-green rectangles. Three oddly 
miniaturized conductors trudge past their resting vehicles, heads bowed in 
weariness or dejection. The long shadows of the late afternoon also suggest a 
symbolic "shadow" -- of the cold hand of industrialization imprisoning people 
in routine jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition brochure essay by assistant curator Susan Anderson mentions 
nothing about Lutz's political beliefs; it would have been interesting, in this 
context, to know what they were. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the 1930s, Lutz began incorporating carnival and circus 
scenes into his work. In "Carnival," broken white brushwork against the 
sapphire sky gives a giant Ferris wheel a magical gleam. The viewer peers from 
the darkness into the froth of lights and action inside the charmed circle of 
booths. Thick white and jewel-color snippets of paint conjure up a gay, 
exuberant mood without actually spelling out the details. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the stark light and dark contrasts lead one to ponder possible symbolic 
intent. Did Lutz view such events as lone bright spots for people whose lives 
had been crushed by the Great Depression, or was he simply celebrating the 
dazzle and energy of a popular American phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
Lutz's paintings of blacks coincided with other "white man's" ventures into 
black culture, such as George Gershwin's 1935 musical "Porgy and Bess" (based 
on the play by DuBose Heyward) and Vincent Minnelli's 1943 movie musical "Cabin 
in the Sky." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, pioneering Supreme Court rulings were guaranteeing equal (if 
still separate) railroad passenger facilities for blacks (1941) and declaring 
the unconstitutionality of whites-only primary elections (1944). And the first 
Congress of Racial Equality sit-in took place in a Chicago restaurant in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in other words, a time when equal rights remained a distant dream, and 
blacks usually were still portrayed in popular art forms as ever happy. Lutz's 
renderings of blacks were not free of caricature, a point Anderson mentions but 
does not pursue in relation to other works of the era. On the other hand, some 
of Lutz's white folks were caricatured too. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, his interests lay specifically in the feverish transports of black 
spirituals. In "I Got a Harp," comma-like dashes of yellow paint sketch in the 
boneless arms of the harpist plying her golden instrument. Against the glowing, 
green-black space, a constellation of black heads wearing misty green gowns 
appear to be a gospel choir. They seem to be gathered at a river, where (in the 
lower right-hand corner) a horizontal figure is being baptized. 
</P>
<P>
The painting combines hints of a real scene and real people with the ethereal 
aura created by the passionate swell of the music. What music? Well, we have to 
fill it in for ourselves. But the fever-brightness of the colors and the sight 
of the massed, dematerialized figures are powerfully suggestive. 
</P>
<P>
In other works, Lutz conjured up a celestial three-horse chariot rising above 
the robed chorus ("Spiritual Chorus") and a fantastic, jewel-colored parade of 
indistinct figures riding on mules, curving into the glowing, aquamarine 
landscape ("The Glory Road"). 
</P>
<P>
But later in the '40s, the artist moved on to new territory. Judging -- 
inadequately, to be sure -- by the two examples in the show, his new 
fascination with mythology lacked the personality of the earlier work. 
"Neptune" seems little more than an excuse to paint with thicker, more 
impenetrable crusts of paint. "Spring Fete," with its forest revelers in 
various stages of undress, looks rather like a wishful libertine dream, 
dutifully disguised as a classical theme. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it's a pity we don't get more of a handle on Lutz, whose themes 
suggest there was a lot more going on in his mind than simply setting paint to 
canvas. The show stands in marked contrast with the museum's other exhibit -- a 
huge, lumbering survey of paintings by Granville Redmond, organized by the 
Oakland Museum and outfitted with a lavish catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Redmond, born in 1871, was another member of the seemingly endless ranks of 
California landscape painters active in the early 20th Century. He specialized 
in scenes of fields speckled with red poppies. The catalogue says the landscape 
appealed to him. But more important, scenes of poppy fields were what the 
public wanted to buy. 
</P>
<P>
So here they are: "California Wild Flowers," "Pond with Poppies," "Poppies and 
Lupines," "Field of Poppies," "Poppy Field Landscape," "California's Flowering 
Hills," "California Landscape with Poppies," and on and on and on. Pleasant 
enough in small doses, perhaps, but tiresome in a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Redmond also painted landscapes at dusk or dawn or in fogbound moments when the 
atmosphere had the dreamy, misty, "poetic" quality sought after by Tonalist 
artists. More acutely afflicted with deafness than Lutz, Redmond is popularly 
supposed to have revealed his auditory solitude in these works. 
</P>
<P>
A few of them escape sentimental landscape cliches and stand on their own as 
works of modern art. Best of all is an undated painting simply called 
"Landscape," from the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in 
which pale lacy trees in several shades of green rise up like flat cut-outs 
against the sky. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a neat, clean transcription of nature for people to admire in their 
living rooms. It's a painting about what a certain corner of the world felt 
like to a particular artist and how he colored it with his own fancies -- 
remade it, in fact, to conform to his cast of mind and sense of formal values. 
</P>
<P>
But collectors of Redmond's day did not care for that sort of thing, 
apparently. And he had bills to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Spiritual Series: Dan Lutz and the American Scene" (through Dec. 31) and 
"Granville Redmond" (through Nov. 19) are at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff 
Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.

Larceny was the big excitement at Stevie Nicks' show Saturday night at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
While the pop diva was taking her customary concluding promenade along the 
stage apron, receiving a tribute of flowers and trinkets, bestowing in return a 
hug or a touch, somebody nicked a ring from one of Stevie's bejeweled hands. 
</P>
<P>
But all's well that ends well: Nicks barely had begun pleading for the return 
of the keepsake (she said it was a gift from her grandmother) when she was told 
that whoever took it had already handed it back. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, though, about those other valuables that disappeared through most of 
Nicks' concert: a commanding voice, an energetic presence and some sense of how 
to pace a show. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who sings a lot about the desire to change, Nicks, now 41, has 
shown no inclination to remake her music or her persona; both wore awfully thin 
at the Pacific. She still plays the role of the gypsy-angel-dove-child, singing 
solipsistic songs that are intended to be mystical but end up merely 
mystifying. 
</P>
<P>
Nicks does have the virtue of sincerity. Her songs about romantic fears, scars 
and yearnings may be fragmented to the point of incomprehensibility, but at 
least they seem to spring from real, deep-seated feelings. And, at her best, 
Nicks has been able to come up with memorable melodies that compensate for her 
opaque lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Pacific, many of her best songs were missing, while several other 
hits were squandered in pallid vocal performances. And Nicks' general lethargy 
made it hard to care much about the feelings in her songs. 
</P>
<P>
She sounded tired and brittle during renditions of "Dreams" and "Gold Dust 
Woman," songs she originally performed as a member of Fleetwood Mac. On her two 
dramatic ballad set-pieces -- "Beauty and the Beast" and "Has Anyone Ever 
Written Anything for You?" -- Nicks' voice was quavery and tattered. Too much 
of the show -- including a droning first half hour -- was taken at the 
meandering mid-tempo that is Nicks' regular rut. 
</P>
<P>
Things got better when Nicks let her sharp, eight-member ensemble rock a little 
on such songs as "No Spoken Word," "Stand Back" and an effectively chugging 
"Edge of Seventeen." Too bad Nicks was not rocking along: If she strayed at all 
from her microphone stand, it was at the slow, shuffling gait of a post-op 
patient. Maybe the problem was Nicks' footwear, the sort of high-heeled 
platform shoes that nobody else has worn since the heyday of Glam Rock. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Nicks' wardrobe got a lot of emphasis and got in the way of more 
important considerations. It isn't that Nicks didn't look lovely and glamorous 
in her feathery blond hair, purple gypsy dress and assorted shawls, cloaks and 
hats. The problem was that after almost every song, she left for a minute or 
two to change her outer wear or find a new hat. Nicks made 11 such exits in a 
show that included just 13 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the connections between songs that can help a concert gather 
momentum and cohesiveness were lost. So were opportunities for Nicks to talk to 
the audience (and most of her songs could stand a bit of between-songs 
explication). The band, highlighted by Carlos Rios' tasteful, concise guitar 
work, kept some of the time-killing instrumental work interesting, but at other 
times Nicks' departures were covered by dull keyboard flourishes and a 
pointless drum solo by the otherwise-sturdy Russ Kunkel. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, after telling the audience how her faith had been shattered, then 
restored, by the ring incident, Nicks bade a Faerie Queen's farewell. She told 
her fans how much she loved and cared about them and expressed concern about 
their well-being for the year to come. 
</P>
<P>
But how about her first obligation to them: the two hours she was on stage? 
Nicks could have served her fans better by dispensing with the costume changes, 
the pointless vocal vamping that marred several songs and the self-indulgent 
promenade at the end -- all of which might have freed up time for more of her 
signature songs (among the missing tunes were such hits as "Stop Draggin' My 
Heart Around," "Leather and Lace," "Rhiannon," "Seven Wonders," "Sara" and 
"Talk to Me"). 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people who came to hear Nicks would probably have preferred hearing 
a few of those to seeing the extent of her collection of cloaks and shawls. 
</P>
<P>
The Hooters' 55-minute opening set included several songs from their upcoming 
album, "Zig Zag." The Philadelphia band plays it too safe with its high-gloss 
take on folk and roots music, but it offers catchy songs and strong playing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new material found the Hooters jumping on the social-consciousness 
bandwagon with songs about the poor and homeless, but the best were "Deliver 
Me," a folk-rock love song, and "Mr. Big Baboon," a lively mixture of Cajun 
accordion music and sax-honking R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
EDITOR'S NOTE: Stevie Nicks' management has refused to allow the press to 
photograph her during this tour.

Huntsman Bids for Aristech Chemical: A group led by Salt Lake City 
industrialist Jon Huntsman has offered to acquire Pittsburgh's Aristech 
Chemical Corp. for $25 a share, or about $817.5 million. Aristech Chemical 
became a publicly held company in December, 1986, after it was spun off from 
USX Corp.'s chemical division. Huntsman, chairman and chief executive of 
Huntsman Chemical Corp., already controls about 7% of Aristech. Aristech could 
not be reached for comment. But a spokesman for Huntsman Chemical said 
Aristech's board will "consider the friendly offer, which is subject to certain 
conditions and will make a response at the appropriate time."

Ad Agency Pleads Innocent: Young &amp; Rubicam, one of the nation's largest 
advertising agencies, pleaded innocent to charges that it paid nearly $1 
million in bribes to Jamaican officials for the island's lucrative tourism 
campaign account. Two company executives and a former executive also pleaded 
innocent in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Conn. The two former Jamaican 
officials charged with accepting the bribes, former Minister of Tourism Anthony 
Abrahams and an adviser, Arnold Foote Jr., were not in court. Arrest warrants 
were issued for the two, but have not been served, said U.S. Attorney Stanley

Anchor Glass Acquired for About $800 million: The huge Mexican glass company 
Vitro SA announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to buy Anchor 
Glass Container Corp. and Latchford Glass Co. of California for more than $900 
million. The Anchor deal, valued at about $800 million, would be the largest 
Mexican takeover of a U.S. company, Vitro said. Vitro's protracted effort to 
take over Tampa-based Anchor, the nation's second-largest glass company, won 
approval by Anchor's directors after the glass giant raised its cash tender 
offer for Anchor stock to $21.25 from $20 a share. Vitro earlier announced a 
friendly merger agreement with Latchford, a small, privately owned glass maker 
based in Huntington Park, Calif.

Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry is planning new measures 
to increase imports from the United States, starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Special agents seeking foreign products appropriate for Japanese markets will 
be stationed in major U.S. cities including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, 
he said. The ministry also plans to send import missions to the United States 
twice a year to find goods for the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
"These schemes are aimed at boosting manufactured goods imports from the U.S.," 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry will draw up a plan to raise imports in cooperation with each U.S. 
state government. The plan will focus on increasing imports from smaller firms, 
since current imports from the United States are mainly from big companies. The 
ministry and 41 state governments with representative offices in Tokyo will 
discuss the scheme on Oct. 31, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to set up committees for increasing imports in 30 
cities in Japan in cooperation with local governments, chambers of commerce and 
distributors to ease the way for local retailers to purchase foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
The committees will sponsor trade fairs several times a year and investigate 
what kind of imports local retailers and consumers want, the official said.

TOYOTA CHANGING ITS CORPORATE CULTURE PROFILE ; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: IN A BID TO BECOME A FIERCER COMPETITOR, THE JAPANESE AUTO GIANT 
SCRAPS ITS OLD SENIORITY SYSTEM AND INCREASES ITS BUDGET FOR RESEARCH.

<P>
Not long ago, Hideki Ueda, 36, was an assistant manager at Toyota Motor Corp., 
with a staff of four to boss around and a title and salary to match. 
</P>
<P>
Now, like 1,000 other former Toyota managers, Ueda has returned to the ranks of 
his staff. Although he retained his higher salary, inside the company he is 
just plain Mr. Ueda, researcher. 
</P>
<P>
"One feels a bit bereft," Ueda admitted in a telephone interview. "On the other 
hand, I'm rid of a lot of niggling, mundane tasks. . . . The wind blows more 
freely through the company." 
</P>
<P>
Ueda's demotion is part of a sweeping internal restructuring of Toyota, until 
now the staid and lumbering giant of the Japanese auto industry. To respond 
more nimbly to advancing technology and become an ever fiercer competitor 
internationally, Toyota is trying to cast aside decades of hierarchical, 
group-oriented tradition in favor of individual creativity and an easy, 
informal flow of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the company put half of its white-collar managers back to work on 
the front line. It reduced the number of approvals needed for any single idea 
to be put into effect. It will base future promotions and raises more on merit 
than seniority, upsetting a revered Japanese custom. 
</P>
<P>
And the company decreed that employees will be known simply by the title -san 
(Mr. or Ms.), rather than by their rank, with even the company president to be 
addressed as "Toyoda-san." 
</P>
<P>
In a language so hierarchical that Japanese sometimes switch to English simply 
to escape the pressure, that apparently cosmetic change might be the most 
revolutionary aspect of Toyota's action. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring affects about 25,000 white-collar workers among Toyota's 
total labor force of 68,000 in Japan. It does not affect the company's 
blue-collar work force, which has long relied on small "teams" that encourage 
ideas to flow from the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The change reflects a Japanese trend to slim down and invest for the future in 
a way that suggests that competition from Japanese industry is unlikely to ease 
up any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Like most big firms, Toyota is plowing money back into future productivity; 
this year, it will increase capital spending by 12.5%, fully half of which will 
go to research and development, according to the Japan Economic Journal. 
</P>
<P>
All this might seem surprising for a corporation that already ranks sixth in 
the world, according to Fortune magazine, with handsome profits and growing 
sales. Toyota sold 4.1 million cars in its fiscal year ended June 30, a 6.2% 
increase above the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
But Toyota has suffered a slight drop of market share, and executives are 
worried that the company might be growing too comfortable with success. 
</P>
<P>
"Toyota's good point was said to be its very solid organization," said Iwao 
Isomura, managing director and member of Toyota's board. "That's fine for 
repeating what you've done before, but we wondered whether it was right for 
responding to all the changes that might come our way." 
</P>
<P>
Among those changes are a maturing of the auto industry, which means Toyota 
cannot continue to grow as quickly as before, and an aging of the Japanese 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Both those changes, in turn, mean more and more bosses for fewer and fewer 
employees, an industrywide problem in Japan. Isomura said a U.S. company would 
respond to such top-heaviness with layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"But in Japan, that's not the way," he said. "So our challenge is to find a way 
to use everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here generally applauded the changes, although they said their effect 
will not be seen for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's obviously going to take awhile for them to get used to it, 
particularly in this culture, and it's going to be hard to stick to it," said 
Sheryl Hogg, who analyzes the automobile industry for County NatWest Securities 
Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're smart to recognize the problem now and try to do something, 
instead of waiting until it's too late. . . . I think it is going to have 
beneficial effects." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take time. There's no quick remedy for the big corporation 
disease," agreed Keisuke Kasagi, an analyst for W. I. Carr. "But it's the right 
step to take at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, Toyota is only playing catch-up. Honda has long been known as a 
more flexible company, and Nissan gave its designers more freedom several years 
ago -- a change that has led to less stodgy cars and growing popularity for 
Nissan, especially among younger buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But Hogg said she believes that Toyota's restructuring is "more far-reaching." 
Toyota, she said, is "huge and very staid, and it is trying to energize itself 
and become more youthful." 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, I'm sure it causes a lot of shock," she said. "If you've been 
sitting around waiting to get your kacho (manager) title, I'm sure it's not a 
very pleasant prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Ueda, the manager-turned-researcher, acknowledged a certain "loneliness" 
resulting from his loss of rank, and he also said that his job has become 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Before, any idea had to pass across his desk; now, he will be consulted by his 
colleagues only if he can prove that he is "capable and trustworthy and 
responsible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the need to prove one's worth will likely weigh heavily on most 
white-collar workers if Toyota's changes, which went into effect Aug. 1, take 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
Where workers could previously expect promotion as long as they showed up for 
work and demonstrated loyalty, now performance will count most -- and greatest 
weight will be given to recent evaluations, "regardless of seniority or past 
evaluations," according to a company statement.

Hong Kong is looking to the private sector to fund up to 60% of an ambitious 
$16.2-billion plan for a replacement airport and a new container port complex, 
according to senior government officials. 
</P>
<P>
The planners are hoping for the massive private participation even though the 
projects will not be completed until well after 1997, when the British colony 
reverts to Chinese sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that the private sector would find it attractive to participate in 
about 40% to 60% of the total," Treasury Secretary Hamish MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
Past Hong Kong infrastructure projects have seen extensive private sector 
participation. But many banks have been reassessing the risks of investing in 
long-term projects in Hong Kong after the bloody military crackdown on 
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing June 3-4, which cast a shadow over Hong 
Kong's future. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement airport, to be built on a site created by flattening the small 
island of Chek Lap Kok to the west of Hong Kong island, will cost around $4.5 
billion.

Japanese department store Sogo Co. is considering acquiring the New York-based 
retail chain Saks Fifth Avenue, according to a Sogo spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not decided whether or not we would make the purchase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Osaka-based store has been approached by parties related 
to Saks but he would give no further details. 
</P>
<P>
Saks is owned by BAT Industries of Britain, which has put the department store 
chain up for sale as part of its attempt to thwart a takeover bid from a group 
of investors lead by Sir James Goldsmith.

AZTECS' VICTORY WASN'T A LOOKER

<TEXT>
<P>
As San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill's eyes glazed over from watching film 
Sunday, he realized that Saturday's 30-26 victory over Cal State Long Beach 
didn't look any better one day later. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this sounds crazy, but we did not play well offensively," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crazy? Well, the Aztecs did gain 501 total yards, the fourth time in six games 
this season they have reached that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Luginbill insisted, "It was our worst offensive game of the season. It 
was a lackadaisical, non-focused effort. It was the first time all year we did 
not catch the ball consistently throughout the game." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan McGwire completed 24 of 42 passes for 299 yards and two 
touchdowns, but he flat-out missed on several attempts when SDSU receivers were 
open. And at other times, Aztec receivers dropped balls they should have 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week was the first time I felt he (McGwire) wasn't totally focused on 
what we're doing," Luginbill said. "It was the first time I haven't seen 
progress. The expectation now is that he will come back this week and play with 
much more concentration." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was a victory that almost felt like a loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Our minds were somewhere else," Luginbill said. "It was embarrassing to me as 
a football coach. My mind certainly wasn't somewhere else. I realize we're not 
playing for a conference championship now, but you've got to go to the next 
level. We have to dominate when we have the opportunity to dominate." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (2-3-1) led by 10 points on three occasions Saturday, but each time Long 
Beach (3-4) was able to get into the game. 
</P>
<P>
After six games, Luginbill has begun formulating his recruiting plans for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, he said, he will award 14 or 15 scholarships to defensive players -- 
most likely to two down linemen and the rest to safeties, cornerbacks and 
linebackers. Four or five scholarships will go to offensive players -- 
preferably running backs, a quarterback, a tight end, a lineman and a punter. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have averaged 20,303 fans a game this season, the lowest in the 
Western Athletic Conference. Saturday's San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium crowd of 
13,548 was the smallest since Nov. 23, 1985, when 10,343 watched Doug Scovil's 
last home game. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said the sparse crowds don't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no qualms with the crowd," he said. "We haven't earned our way yet. 
When we play decent football, they'll come. Now, we're teasing them. You have 
to earn your way back into people's hearts after you've disappointed them." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes: 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire was in Oakland Sunday night to watch 
his brother, Athletic first baseman Mark McGwire, play in the World Series. . . 
. Cal State Long Beach gained 165 yards on seven kickoff returns. "Our kickoff 
team was an adventure in Disneyland," SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. Luginbill 
has already shifted some personnel on the kickoff team, but said, "There's 
going to be some more (changes) as well." . . . SDSU leads the series with its 
next opponent, Pacific, 14-7. Pacific's last victory against SDSU was in 1958, 
a record-setting 68-17. The 68 points are the most ever allowed in a game by an 
Aztec defense. . . . Luginbill said Jason Swaney will start at defensive tackle 
against Pacific. Swaney has been a back-up defensive end most of the year. . . 
. Ron Slack's 41 rushing attempts (197 yards) Saturday against Long Beach were 
the second-most ever by an Aztec running back. Paul Hewitt carried 45 times for 
259 yards against Air Force in 1988. . . . The Aztecs' two victories in six 
games is their best start in three years. In 1988, the Aztecs were 1-7 before 
winning their second game. In 1987, they were 1-6.

DIET COMPANY ADS ARE MIXING FAME WITH PHYSIQUE; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS HAVE HELPED BOOST PROFITS -- AND ALSO 
FATTENED THE WALLETS OF SOME SLIMMED-DOWN STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda shaved nearly 40 pounds off of 
his famous frame this year in a highly publicized wager with his players, there 
were two big winners. 
</P>
<P>
One was a group of Nashville nuns who received the proceeds from the $50,000 
bet. The other was Lasorda, who was hired as a pitchman for the liquid diet 
supplement he used. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda thus joined the growing ranks of celebrities earning fat salaries and 
other inducements for slimming down, a group credited with boosting diet 
company sales by as much as 100% in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts say Hollywood heavyweights such as Elliot Gould, Susan St. 
James and Lynn Redgrave, and even popular local radio personalities such as 
Bill Keene and Joe Lyons, have helped to revolutionize the way 
ultra-competitive weight reduction programs are promoted. 
</P>
<P>
Diet advertising, once the domain of frighteningly fat people depicted in 
before and after photographs, has inspired a marriage of two great American 
obsessions, fame and physique. 
</P>
<P>
People apparently draw inspiration from the sight of Lasorda sans a few extra 
chins or a shapely St. James, even if they lack access to the same support 
system as the stars, such as private trainers, nutritionists and agents 
hounding them to slim down for an upcoming role. 
</P>
<P>
"Many individuals genuinely identify with these people," said USC marketing 
professor David W. Stewart. "They would like to be as attractive, as famous and 
as successful as these celebrities. And one way to take on their personas is to 
use a product they endorse." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's persona is about as deeply ingrained as any. Until recently it 
revolved around food -- lots of food. The Dodger manager enjoyed a legendary 
reputation for pasta consumption and was reputed to have once downed more than 
100 oysters before a ball game. 
</P>
<P>
He was also tied to a seemingly endless number of food and indigestion 
products, including frozen pizza, spaghetti sauce, antacid tablets and a chain 
of restaurants bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said he saw the light last spring, when pitcher Orel Hershiser and left 
fielder Kirk Gibson saw him starting on his third plate of linguine and begged 
him to surrender his fork for the sake of his health. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a widely reported wager, Hershiser and Gibson pledged $30,000 to 
Lasorda's favorite charity, the Sisters of Mercy, if he dropped 20 pounds by 
the All-Star break in July. 
</P>
<P>
Not so widely reported was the fact that Lasorda, 62, also struck a separate 
deal with the makers of a liquid diet concoction called Ultra Slim-Fast that 
promised him a lucrative endorsement fee if he dropped the extra pounds by 
adhering to their weight loss program. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, who was courted by representatives of every major diet company, said 
he settled on Ultra Slim-Fast after team doctors assured him it was medically 
safe and the owners agreed to pony up an extra $20,000 for the nuns. At 180 
pounds, he has since become a traveling guru of girth reduction whose physique 
is frequently lauded by baseball broadcasters, not to mention in television and 
print advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy who has always been known for loving food," said Steve Brener of 
Ultra Slim-Fast, who also happens to be the Dodgers' former publicity director. 
"The nation has found out that if Tommy can do it, they can do it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials won't discuss their revenue or the terms of the endorsement 
contract, but those within the diet industry say Ultra Slim-Fast sales soared 
thanks to Lasorda, especially among middle-aged men who are not ordinarily 
swayed by weight loss appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe how many people have said I've been an inspiration to them," 
Lasorda said. "There are thousands of people all over the country losing weight 
because of this." 
</P>
<P>
Noreen C. Jenney, president of the Celebrity Endorsement Network in Woodland 
Hills, a group that matches stars with advertisers, said people such as Lasorda 
are well compensated for their work. A diet program endorsement is worth 
$100,000 to $300,000 a year, Jenney said. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't necessarily mean that celebrities are clamoring for the chance to 
confide their fat-fighting formulas, however, especially when they can command 
the same kind of fees for promoting cars or beer. Jenney said many stars 
consider diet ads unseemly. Among them is Elizabeth Taylor, who turned down an 
offer of $1 million to promote a weight loss program, despite the fact that she 
has since gone on to author a diet book called "Elizabeth Takes Off: On Weight 
Gain, Weight Loss, Self-image and self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say diet companies can afford to offer tremendous salaries to 
celebrities because theirs is a lucrative business, with revenues now reaching 
roughly $3 billion a year. The fattest purse belongs to Weight Watchers, which 
earned about $1.3 billion last year. Ranked behind it are Nutri/System, the 
Diet Center and Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres. 
</P>
<P>
Nutri/System spokesman James K. Millard said innovative marketing is an 
essential tool in the diet business. "There's usually a high level of 
distrust," he said. "So we know what we're fighting against in the public's 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
The chains spend about $20 million annually on product promotion. In their 
quest to find celebrity spokespersons who are both popular with the masses and 
credible, Jenney said diet companies often end up turning to their own 
membership roles. 
</P>
<P>
Having a highly visible representative can backfire, of course, if the 
celebrity falls off the diet wagon. So contracts generally stipulate that the 
prophets of thinness must remain thin themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"If the celebrity regains the weight, it doesn't speak well for the product," 
Jenney said. "The moment they gain 10 or 15 pounds they'll be on the front of 
the National Enquirer." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened so far. Nor is there any evidence of diet promotions 
wrecking anyone's reputation. On the contrary, it is widely believed that Lynn 
Redgrave revived her sagging career when she started doing commercials for 
Weight Watchers food products six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
John Clark, Redgrave's husband and agent, said Redgrave was unemployable in the 
early 1980s, because of a run-in with a major studio over her desire to breast 
feed her child on the set. "Lynn had just gotten fired from the sitcom, "House 
Calls," our legal bills were huge and we had just run out of money," Clark 
said. "So when this came along, sure we grabbed it." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Redgrave, whom he described as a "former fatty," was a natural 
choice for spokeswoman because she had used Weight Watchers. Stan Darger, vice 
president of sales and marketing for Foodways National, the parent company, 
said Redgrave helped boost sales by 100%. Thanks largely to her ads, Weight 
Watchers is now the top-selling low calorie frozen food. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that customers relate to the actress's weight problems, Darger 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"People identify with her and they also like her," Darger said. "They know that 
she had faced a weight challenge and defeated it. Plus, she brings continuity 
to the product." 
</P>
<P>
One factor weight-loss promoters such as Redgrave have in their favor is the 
sheer numbers of fat people. Studies show that obesity remains a major health 
problem. Roughly 20% of the adult population, or 33 million Americans, were 
judged to be significantly overweight in one recent survey. Another showed that 
more than 40% of all adults perceive themselves as fat. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, surveys show that dieters are far less self-reliant than they 
once were. In a recent survey of women who consider themselves overweight, 40% 
said they could not shed the pounds without assistance. Ninety percent of the 
diet industry's customers are women. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William McCarthy, the behavioral research director in UCLA's clinical 
nutrition department, said it's all right if celebrities draw people into 
weight loss programs if the programs are medically sound. The danger, he said, 
is when people chose a diet plan in order to emulate their favorite 
celebrities, and not because they have researched the programs, some of which 
charge as much as $500 in fees and an additional $50 a week for their food 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"If people have followed reports of Lasorda's battle of the bulge, then they 
know he's been successful, and they make the inference that the product must be 
pretty good," McCarthy said. "It's bothersome in the sense that we wish people 
were more careful about product claims." 
</P>
<P>
Yet McCarthy said no one foresees an end to the celebrity diet tie-ins. In a 
business that turns on the success of direct-response advertising, stars have 
proven to be especially effective pitchmen. Television advertisers who flash 
toll free numbers in conjunction with their products say that celebrity 
endorsements bring in roughly 10% to 15% more business than all other types. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Liljenquist, senior vice president of communications for the Diet Center, 
said his company's business jumped 11% to 48% in test markets where their 
spokeswoman, St. James, was used. Liljenquist said he has a tough time 
imagining a diet company surviving without a star. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say that it's absolutely necessary," he said. "But it's obviously a 
very popular strategy from a marketing standpoint. It has proven to be very 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
St. James, 43, who developed a weight problem after the birth of her fourth 
child, was hired after she lost 20 pounds on the Diet Center's program. 
Liljenquist said the actress, who declined to discuss the program herself, 
helps distinguish the company from its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our name is almost generic, so we needed a very identifiable individual to set 
the Diet Center apart as an entity," he explained. "Susan St. James was just 
the person to do that, because this is not a hard sell. She is simply speaking 
from her own personal experience." 
</P>
<P>
Gould, who advertises Jenny Craig's program, also draws on his own dieting 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, the 51-year-old actor said Craig helped him control a 
serious eating disorder. Gould, who lost 22 pounds in 10 weeks under her 
program, said he had no qualms about doing a diet commercial. "I've come too 
far and suffered too much in this business to start lying now," he said. 
"Besides, acting is all about communicating." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman F. Kane, advertising director for Jenny Craig International, said the 
Gould spots are mostly used to introduce the program in new markets. Craig also 
recently hired actress Susan Ruttan of television's "L.A. Law," who lost 42 
pounds on the program, as a spokeswoman. The company has found that celebrity 
endorsements are an essential marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
"With the celebrities, we usually don't have to show a 'before' type of 
picture," Kane said. "That's kind of tacky. And besides, most people already 
know what they look like." 
</P>
<P>
Craig also uses radio personalities as pitchmen, a strategy first tried some 25 
years ago and more recently updated by the Nutri/System weight loss chain. 
Under that arrangement, radio people use the diet for free and discuss the 
results they've achieved during air time purchased by the diet companies. Bill 
Keene of KNX-AM was an especially effective spokesman for Nutri/System when he 
took on the nickname of "Skinny Keene," and even put his wife on the program. 
</P>
<P>
Millard said Nutri/System has grown from 800 centers to nearly 1,500 centers 
since the radio campaigns started in 1986. The company now contracts with about 
1,000 disc jockeys nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners of country music station KNTF-FM have followed Joe Lyons' progress as 
he's dropped 30 some pounds under the Jenny Craig program. The only drawback to 
dieting in the public eye, said Lyons, is that even strangers start to monitor 
your eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't walk into a pizza parlor anymore without someone saying I'm cheating," 
he said.

The East German Embassy gave 49 refugees documents allowing them to claim West 
German passports today under a new agreement to allow 1,400 East Germans in 
Poland to emigrate to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The 49 refugees renounced their East German citizenship at the embassy in 
Warsaw and were given documents allowing them to claim West German citizenship 
at Bonn's embassy as a prelude to their trip west. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 East Germans are in Poland seeking to travel to West Germany and 
more are arriving every day. More than 1,200 have already gone to West Germany 
through Poland in recent weeks but the 49 given documents today were the first 
to benefit from an emigration agreement reached Saturday.

<P>
Police were searching today for a gunman who shot to death a 22-year-old Canoga 
Park man who tried to crash a wedding anniversary party at a church. 
</P>
<P>
Rojelio Galvan was struck in the head by a shotgun blast about 12:30 a.m. 
Sunday after a party guest grabbed a shotgun from a nearby truck and fired four 
rounds, Los Angeles Police Detective Larry Dolley said. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan and several friends tried to crash a 25th anniversary party being held 
in the basement of Emerson Unitarian Church at 7304 Jordan Ave., Dolley said. 
</P>
<P>
A fight broke out in the street between Galvan's group and members of the 
party, police said. Galvan was shot as he tried to drive away. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan's friends drove him to Nu-Med Regional Medical Center in Canoga Park, 
where he was pronounced dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Rick Swanston said today that police believe they have identified the

TEACHERS STRIKE FOR FIRST TIME IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Confusion reigned today in Beverly Hills schools as nearly 300 teachers went 
out on strike demanding better pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The strike, the first in the district's history, affected 4,700 elementary and 
high school students in five schools. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Beverly Hills Police Department, no violence 
was reported at any of the five campuses. 
</P>
<P>
A chair, books and papers were thrown out an open window at Beverly Hills High 
School but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Striking teachers taunted substitute instructors as they entered the schools, 
yelling "How can you take my job?" and "Shame on you." 
</P>
<P>
The district has recruited about 200 substitutes at $185 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks between teachers and the Beverly Hills school district collapsed 
Thursday. Supt. Robert French said that no new talks have been scheduled and 
that the district has "not taken any action to change its position." 
</P>
<P>
Starting pay in Beverly Hills is $21,604 a year, while maximum pay is $46,270. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers have complained that their salaries now are lower than those paid 
by the Los Angeles Unified School District, where teachers won a 24% raise over 
three years after a nine-day strike last May. Los Angeles teachers earn $27,346

TRUMP CANCELS AMR BID AS STOCK DIPS TO $84.87 1/2

<P>
Donald Trump scrapped his proposed $7-billion offer for AMR Corp. today but 
said he is still considering making a lower bid for the parent of American 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second unraveling of a giant airline deal since Friday and came 
against a background of growing alarm over debt-financed takeovers for large 
American companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I am currently reviewing all my options with respect to AMR including making 
another offer at a lower price," the New York-based developer said in a letter 
to AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said he is also considering increasing his holdings in AMR or selling his 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Trump sent his letter after AMR's stock dropped $13.75 a share to $84.87 1/2 on 
the New York Stock Exchange today following Friday's 190-point decline in the 
Dow Jones industrial average. Trump had offered to buy AMR for $120 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's stock plunge was caused in part by word that the management-led 
employee group seeking to buy UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, had 
been unable to secure financing for its proposed $6.75-billion buyout of that 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
AMR's stock was depressed today amid the uncertain outlook for airline 
takeovers. Trading in the airline's shares was temporarily halted pending the 
announcement of Trump's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
AMR, based in Ft. Worth, said it has no comment on Trump's decision. The 
airline, which has said it wanted to remain independent, had said it would 
study Trump's proposal but the company made no other response to his overtures.

ACTOR-DIRECTOR CORNEL WILDE DIES AT 74 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cornel Wilde, who starred in a string of swashbuckling film melodramas and was 
nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Frederic Chopin in "A Song to 
Remember," died today at 74, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde, who produced, directed and starred in many of his medium-budget films, 
entered Cedars Sinai Hospital Sept. 2, for treatment of leukemia and died of 
the disease, a spokeswoman said. His son, Cornel Wilde Jr., was at his side 
when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Wilde's big chance came in 1945 when he played an ailing Chopin in the 
Technicolor film "A Song to Remember." One film writer said he grew paler and 
wanner with each reel while fingering an impressive sound track on a mute 
piano. The pianist off screen was Jose Iturbi. 
</P>
<P>
During his Hollywood career, which spanned from 1940 to 1987, he was involved 
in more than 50 movies. 
</P>
<P>
He was best known for acting in adventure movies including "The Naked Prey," 
"High Sierra," "The Bandit of Sherwood Forest," "Beyond Mombasa," "Omar 
Khayyam," "Constantine and the Cross," and "The Fifth Musketeer." 
</P>
<P>
The 1955 movie "The Big Combo," which he produced and starred in, was 
criticized at the time for being too violent. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get away from violence in drama," was his reply. "If you do not have 
conflict, you do not have drama. If a brutal scene is shown for no reason 
except to shock, then it is bad." 
</P>
<P>
He also acted in, directed and produced "Devil's Hairpin," "Maracaibo," "Sword 
of Lancelot," and "Shark's Treasure." His last movie was "My Very Wilde Life," 
filmed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City on Oct. 13, 1915, Wilde married actress Patricia Knight 
in 1938. They had a daughter, Wendy, and divorced in 1951. He married actress 
Jean Wallace that year and had a son. He and Wallace were divorced in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements are pending.

BUSH MAINTAINS FAITH IN CIA CHIEF, AIDE SAYS

President Bush condemned as "outrageous" reports that he has lost confidence in 
CIA Director William H. Webster and that the agency's leader may be replaced, a 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has complete confidence in Director Webster," White House press 
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post today reported White House disenchantment with Webster's 
performance, particularly in light of the attempted coup earlier this month 
against Panama's Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said he did not know whether Bush had personally spoken to Webster to 
reassure him. But the spokesman said Webster knew that the President was 
satisfied with his work. 
</P>
<P>
The Post said senior Bush Administration officials are frustrated by Webster's 
intelligence gathering and have begun to talk about possibly replacing him with 
someone who can advise the President more actively. 
</P>
<P>
White House chief of staff John H. Sununu was quoted as saying, "He learned 
more about the attempted coup in Panama from watching Cable News Network than 
from Webster's Central Intelligence Agency." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggested former CIA official James Lilley, now U.S. ambassador 
to China, as a possible successor to Webster. 
</P>
<P>
"The President has not been critical" of the CIA director, Fitzwater said. "I 
don't think the President has ever suggested" that he was not doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that although Webster was out of the United States on Oct. 3 
when the attempted coup took place in Panama City, he was "in constant contact 
with National Security Council officials."

The Bush Administration plans to extend a 19-month-old ban on federal funding 
for research using fetal tissue, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, has recommended to HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan that the ban 
be continued over the objections of two federal panels, the New York Times 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is expected to act within a week, said the newspaper, which cited no 
sources for its information. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents have strongly opposed using fetal tissue for medical 
research, although scientists say transplanting fetal tissue into adults may be 
effective in treating diabetes and Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
HHS imposed the ban in March, 1988, while the department reviewed the issue.

International Business Machines Corp. said today its third-quarter earnings 
dropped 29.7% to $877 million in what the computer giant termed a short-term 
lapse from its generally improved outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share dropped 28.1% from the third quarter a year ago to $1.51 
from $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue crept up 4.3% to $14.31 billion, below the first half of the year's 
gain of better than 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed new product changeovers and a switch among customers to 
leasing from buying for hurting results. The strength of the dollar has also 
hurt its revenues from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"While these short-term financial results are disappointing, demand for IBM 
products and services continues to be good worldwide," IBM Chairman John Akers 
said in a statement.

Scores of tourists lined up early today outside the New York Stock Exchange, 
hoping to get an eyewitness view of the trading spasms on the vast floor where 
brokers feared another Black Monday panic. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm watching a car accident," said John Egan, 24, a New Yorker 
waiting to get into the visitors' gallery. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people queued by the visitors' entrance to the nation's biggest stock 
market, where on Friday the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 190.53 points to 
2,569.26, its biggest point loss since the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
NYSE officials did not immediately allow anyone into the gallery however, and 
tan-coated exchange sentries guarded the building's entrances amid the 
skyscraper canyons of southern Manhattan. About 20 New York police on 
motorcycles and horseback were deployed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of press photographers stood outside and television news crew vehicles 
were parked on Wall Street on the cool, foggy morning. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how you see it, something sudden and very important happened on 
Friday," said John van Rosendaal, 26, a Columbia University journalism student 
who was waiting in the visitors' gallery line. "Something big's happening and I 
want to be there when it does." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, about 15 scraggly anarchist squatters from a nearby park 
carried placards that read "sell today, jump tomorrow." A few shouted, "Watch 
for falling stockbrokers!" 
</P>
<P>
Nearby a man claiming to represent jailed political extremist Lyndon LaRouche 
roamed around, handing out leaflets that said, "Lyndon told you so." 
</P>
<P>
"Where there's dead meat, there's the flock," said Laura Januzzi, 26, a tourist 
from Cincinnati who said she worked in the marketing department of McDonald's 
Corp.

GREENSPAN NOTES BANKING RISKS, URGES HIGH CAPITAL 
</P>

<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that the level of risk in 
the banking industry is higher now than in the recent past and urged bankers to 
maintain the capital ratios of institutions in their highly leveraged industry. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can know what problems lie ahead. Nonetheless, banks with strong 
capital positions are more likely to survive periods of uncertainty than are 
those with weak ratios," Greenspan said in a speech to the annual meeting of 
the American Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said current capital levels are at the low end of their historical 
range despite recent efforts by bankers to improve the ratio of assets to 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the nation's 13,000 commercial banks already exceed existing 
minimum capital standards, "it is important to keep in mind that, in both 
relative and absolute terms, banking is a highly leveraged industry," Greenspan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Current capital requirements should not impede banking competitiveness, and by 
maintaining adequate capital levels banks will boost the public's confidence, 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that more than 700 banks have failed in the past five years alone 
demonstrates that banking is far from risk free," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks by 1992 must have a capital-to-assets ratio of 8% under 
guidelines established by the Federal Reserve, the office of the comptroller of 
the currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the savings and loan bailout bill requires thrifts to have a 6% 
capital-to-assets ratio and a 3% ratio of core capital to assets. 
</P>
<P>
The bid to boost banking capital has sent several financial institutions 
scrambling for cash. Greenspan said he does not believe that the capital 
requirements are too high by historical standards. Current capital ratios are 
less than one-half the level of 50 years ago, he said.

Dolphins linebacker John Offerdahl signed a one-year contract and reported to 
camp today, ending a 2 1/2-month holdout that caused him to miss the team's 
first six games. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed, but a source close to 
negotiations said the contract will permit Offerdahl to become a free agent 
after this season. 
</P>
<P>
Offerdahl, a Pro Bowl selection in each of his three years in the NFL, had been 
in the option year of a contract that was to pay him $201,500 this year. The 
Dolphins offered him a four-year, $2.6-million deal in July, but when training 
camp began, team management refused to negotiate until Offerdahl reported.

GIAMATTI CONSTANTLY ON VINCENT'S MIND;

<P>
ABOUT BAY AREA SERIES? 'SOMETHING ELOQUENT AND MEMORABLE'

<P>
Hardly an inning goes by during the World Series that Fay Vincent does not 
think about Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, baseball's new commissioner thinks about what he misses about his good 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
He misses many things, but especially the eloquence and the humor. 
</P>
<P>
For six months, Giamatti and Vincent made plans for baseball. Their plans 
included attending Giamatti's first World Series as commissioner in October. 
</P>
<P>
But Giamatti had a fatal heart attack on Sept. 1, and a couple weeks later 
Vincent took his friend's place. 
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 days, Vincent has spent a lot of time in the Bay Area 
attending the playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
At the Oakland Coliseum on Sunday before Game 2, Vincent was asked what 
Giamatti would have thought about a Bay Area Series. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I don't know," Vincent wondered aloud. "He would have said something 
eloquent and memorable, I'm sure. It is beyond me." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent, however, does have the ability to make people around him feel 
comfortable despite still grieving for his friend. 
</P>
<P>
"For me it's still hard to believe," he said. "It seems so unreal. I still feel 
Bart is here." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent's thoughts drifted and he looked to the outfield sky, then to the 
commissioner's box where Giamatti would have presided and told his stories. 
</P>
<P>
"His son threw out the first ball yesterday, and this World Series is being 
dedicated to his memory," the commissioner said. "The tributes were nice." 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, a Renaissance scholar, also loved to write about baseball, and his 
words painted a picture of feelings, rather than statistics. 
</P>
<P>
When a visitor would call on Giamatti, he showed a shy excitement when bringing 
out some articles he had written about the game. If you wanted, copies were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"Before he died, Bart finished a book, and it will be coming out soon; you'll 
enjoy it," Vincent said. "He asked me to read it, and I told him I particularly 
liked the end of the third chapter. He asked what was wrong with the first 
two." 
</P>
<P>
But just as the game goes on, so does the job of the new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
In the months to come, Vincent will be faced with tough labor negotiations and 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think expansion is necessary, but it probably will happen," Vincent 
said. "It's difficult to deny expansion. There is a terrific interest in 
various areas of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent is a former CEO at Columbia pictures and a high-ranking executive with 
Coca-Cola. Giamatti appointed him deputy commissioner because of Vincent's keen 
business sense. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the negotiations with the players' union, Vincent said he will 
be "opportunistic" in helping the process. 
</P>
<P>
But the few days of the World Series is a time for fun and, this year, a time 
for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had so many good invitations," Vincent joked. "I went to some World 
Series games in 1986 when the Mets played Boston and in the early '60s when the 
Yankees were in it. This is great. I think the World Series is a terrific 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart and I had looked forward to being here together." 
</P>
<P>
One would like to think they are.

Giants slugger Will Clark, raspy-voiced and feverish with tonsillitis, missed 
practice today as his team used an off-day to work out and try to regroup for 
Game 3 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who remained in the clubhouse dressed in street clothes while his 
teammates took batting practice, said he definitely will play in Game 3 Tuesday 
at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he might miss the game, Clark replied there were only two things that 
would keep him out: "I've either gotta be in the hospital or be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who went 0-for-4 in Sunday's 5-1 loss that gave Oakland a 2-0 lead in 
the Series, said he has been feeling bad for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little of everything," he said of the illness. "It started out as 
tonsillitis, and it's gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a hero of the Giants' National League playoff victory over the Chicago 
Cubs, had a double and single in the opening game, a 5-0 loss to the A's.

CLIPPERS' BENOIT BENJAMIN REPORTEDLY GOING TO ITALY

Center Benoit Benjamin spurned a new contract with the Clippers and signed with 
major league champion Philips Milan, the Italian basketball team announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, meanwhile, has called a news conference this afternoon in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
James Casey, one of three agents representing the 7-footer, said this morning 
that Benjamin has a one-year deal to play in Milan but that the door is still 
open for him to return to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a chance he could be with the Clippers," Casey said. "But the Clippers 
have to step forward or else we'll be out of here." 
</P>
<P>
A team spokesman said the club is waiting to see what Benjamin has to say at 
the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said the sides are "far apart." The Clippers have questioned the maturity 
and conditioning of Benjamin and reportedly are offering a two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
A Philips Milan spokesman said Benjamin will arrive in Milan on Tuesday and 
will probably debut with the Italian team in the McDonald's open tournament 
that begins Friday in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day tournament is a four-team affair with the NBA's Denver Nuggets, 
Philips, Spain's Barcelona and Yugoslavia's Yugoplastika Split. 
</P>
<P>
Philips did not immediately report the terms of Benjamin's contract, but 
reliable sources disclosed that it was a one-year agreement for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Benjamin's contract would be the third-highest paid to an 
American by an Italian club. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Messaggero Rome signed the Clippers' Danny Ferry, a former Duke 
All-America, and Brian Shaw, the former Boston Celtics guard. Their contracts 
reportedly ranged between $1.2 million and $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the Philips lineup, Benjamin will join former NBA star Bob McAdoo and 
Italian internationals Antonello Riva and Dino Meneghin. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, who had joined the Clippers in 1985, will substitute at Philips for 
fellow-American Marc Iavaroni, who tore his knee ligaments in his very first 
game in Italy last month. 
</P>
<P>
Iavaroni will be sidelined for about three months. 
</P>
<P>
Italian teams can field two non-Italians in major league matches. Philips, 
which has been playing with only one American, has lost its last two matches 
and fallen to sixth place in the standings after five rounds of the regular 
season.

<P>
The Broncos today rehired Mike Shanahan, who was fired as head coach of the 
Raiders on Oct. 3 after the team built a 1-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan was an assistant coach in Denver for four seasons, serving as 
offensive coordinator during Denver's two Super Bowl seasons, 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan will become Denver's quarterback coach under the contract and is 
expected to begin leading practices later this week, said Matt Cook, a Broncos 
spokesman. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, 37, guided the Raiders to a 7-9 record in his first season as head 
coach in 1988. This year, after winning their opener, the Raiders lost their 
next three games. He was replaced by Art Shell, who became the first black head 
coach in modern NFL history.
