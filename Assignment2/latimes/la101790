DUFFY RENEGES ON PROMISE TO PUNISH 'RAMBO SQUAD'; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF HAD SAID HE WOULD FIRE OR DEMOTE ERRANT DEPUTIES AT EL 
CAJON COUNTY JAIL.

Contrary to Sheriff John Duffy's public pronouncements last year that he would 
fire, demote and suspend deputies found to have abused inmates at the El Cajon 
jail as part of a so-called "Rambo Squad," none of those disciplined received 
worse than a suspension, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy promised the San Diego County Grand Jury in August that he had taken 
disciplinary action against 10 deputies, including several high-ranking 
officers, after an internal investigation confirmed that deputies engaged in 
"deliberate and cruel harassment . . . to show the inmates who's running the 
jails." 
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Grand Jury that outlined the discipline, Duffy said he 
found that his deputies and officers violated several policies related to the 
treatment of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"Specific disciplinary actions ordered by me include termination from 
employment; demotion in rank; 30-day suspension without pay; 10-day suspension 
without pay; and five-day suspension without pay," Duffy told the Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be specific, but rest assured that I have ordered appropriate 
discipline for all 10 individuals, including ranking officers," he said in the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Two sources close to the department said Duffy planned to fire some deputies of 
the so-called "Rambo Squad," demote a sergeant to deputy, suspend a sergeant 
and lieutenant for 10 days, suspend another lieutenant for 30 days and suspend 
a captain for 35 days. 
</P>
<P>
But he changed his mind upon the advice of Undersheriff Richard Sandberg, the 
No. 2 man in the department, who held hearings with nine of the 10 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The lieutenant and sergeant served their 10-day suspensions. But each of the 
deputies accepted a short suspension instead of being fired. 
</P>
<P>
The other sergeant was not demoted but was given a 20-day suspension and the 
other lieutenant had his 30-day suspension reduced to 20 days. The captain, 
Maudie Bobbitt, served a 35-day suspension and has taken her case to a county 
Civil Service Commission hearing, where it is scheduled to be heard later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed Tuesday, Duffy confirmed that all 10 deputies and officers received 
no worse than suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
"They all admitted their guilt and entered into what you could call a plea 
bargain," Duffy said. "I could have disregarded (the undersheriff's) 
recommendations, but I saved the county hundreds of thousands of dollars going 
through the county's civil service hearing process." 
</P>
<P>
He said the punishments were fairly severe. 
</P>
<P>
"A 10-day suspension is pretty substantial, pal," he said. "Have you ever gone 
10 days without pay, medical benefits and insurance?" 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's attorney, Martin J. Mayer, said Duffy was not trying to mislead the 
Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
"When the sheriff made his statements, he was reacting to preliminary reports 
he was getting. This was all before (the deputies) had a chance to respond and 
express what mitigating factors may have occurred," Mayer said. "They were able 
to convince the sheriff that, perhaps, his original discipline was too severe." 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said the punishments were "fair and equitable considering (the deputies') 
records, the nature of what was going on and the reasons why these things were 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
The incidents at the El Cajon Jail, because they did not include physical 
beatings of inmates, amounted to no more than "fraternity hazing," Mayer said. 
The inmates "were not being hit or abused. They were being hazed," Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who has been sheriff since 1971, announced late last year that he would 
not run again, after press scrutiny of his home security system. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, who is running against Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown 
to succeed Duffy, said the sheriff "cut deals with deputies. He publicly ranted 
and raved and said he was going to fire people, and then, once the heat was 
off, he cut internal deals with people if they wouldn't take their cases to 
civil service hearings." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy did not want Civil Service hearings to occur because he was still 
considering whether to run for sheriff and was wary of bad publicity, according 
to Everett Bobbitt, who initially represented the 10 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Duffy realized that he could not win during Civil Service and, even if 
he won, it would generate so much bad press that it would be a tremendous 
liability," Bobbitt said. Bobbitt is representing his wife, Capt. Maudie 
Bobbitt, in the last unresolved "Rambo Squad" case. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer said Duffy had no problem with deputies appearing at the Civil Service 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"All (the deputies) would have been testifying to is their own improper 
conduct," Mayer said. "There would have been no harm to the sheriff." Duffy 
"immediately jumped on the problems with the jail and called for the Grand Jury 
investigation in the first place," Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
J. Phil Franklin, the foreman for the 1989-90 Grand Jury to whom Duffy 
addressed his August 1989 letter relating the punishments, said he is not 
surprised by the contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why we need a civilian review board to follow up on matters in the 
Sheriff's Department," he said. "Until you have a civilian review board, you'll 
never truly know what's going on in the department. I certainly didn't know 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
Creation of such a review panel is on the November ballot. If it is approved by 
the voters, the panel would be established by the Board of Supervisors with 
broad subpoena powers to investigate all aspects of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988-89 Grand Jury investigated jail conditions at the request of Duffy and 
the Board of Supervisors. In March 1989, the jury harshly criticized the 
sheriff's handling of the jails. It concluded that members of a "Rambo Squad" 
-- the media label placed on the deputies involved -- were indeed guilty of 
abuse, including an exercise in which inmates had to lean spread-eagle against 
a wall until they lost muscle control and having deputies frequently scrape an 
inmate's face against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Grand Jury said, deputies would "delight in cruelty to others" 
when they would squash packets of mustard, catsup and mayonnaise so that the 
contents would spray into cells and the inmates would be forced to clean the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
Although Duffy had predicted that he would be exonerated by the Grand Jury's 
report, the panel blamed him for "a lack of leadership" by failing to 
investigate the jail problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership chose to focus their attention on the personalities of the 
complainants while ignoring whether or not there was any substance to the 
complaints," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Grand Jury's report, Duffy launched his own internal investigation, 
drawing many of the same conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy was particularly vehement in expressing disgust with the 10 deputies 
he vowed to discipline, calling their actions "inexcusable, unprofessional and 
embarrassing to the department." 
</P>
<P>
In his initial response in March, 1989, to the Grand Jury's findings, Duffy 
described the conduct of the "Rambo Squad" and those who helped cover up their 
actions as "stupid, disgusting and outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
In that report, Duffy said he had one regret about the Grand Jury's findings: 
</P>
<P>
"My only disappointment with your report is that the deputies you describe were 
not indicted or at least publicly named. . . . I assure you that those 
responsible will be held accountable and will be dealt with severely."

JURY SEES VIDEO OF DEPUTIES TAKING CASH; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE DEFENSE MAINTAINS THAT A STING OPERATION TAPE SHOWS CORRECT 
UNDERCOVER TECHNIQUE. THE OFFICERS ARE ACCUSED OF SKIMMING MONEY CONFISCATED 
FROM DRUG DEALERS.

<P>
Jurors in the money-skimming trial of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's 
narcotics officers Tuesday viewed portions of a videotape that showed two 
deputies pulling bundles of cash from a tote bag during an FBI sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
The murky image of the deputies taking the cash from the penthouse suite of a 
Sherman Oaks hotel -- considered a key piece of evidence by federal prosecutors 
-- was part of the 19 minutes of videotape excerpts played in Los Angeles 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white video of Deputies James R. Bauder and Daniel M. Garner, 
taken by one of the six surveillance cameras in the Aug. 30, 1989, sting, shows 
the deputies entering the suite of a suspected drug dealer and transferring the 
cash from the tote bag to a smaller bag, then rushing out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have alleged that the two deputies, who are on trial along with 
five other veteran sheriff's narcotics officers, stole the $30,000 as part of a 
longtime practice of skimming funds seized from suspected drug traffickers and 
money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
But both officers and their attorneys said the video merely showed jurors a 
technique used by narcotics officers to seize a portion of the money in case a 
drug raid goes awry. They also blamed any theft that evening on former 
Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, who is to testify this week as the government's 
chief prosecution witness. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Podberesky, Bauder's attorney, acknowledged that her client took money 
from the bag that had been left in the hotel room by an undercover FBI agent 
posing as a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not denying that," she said after the tape was played in court. "We have 
a perfectly legitimate explanation for it. They took the money to ensure that 
the Sheriff's Department would get something in the forfeiture case if the drug 
dealer got away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was at Sobel's direction we took the money," Garner added, "and then we 
gave the money to him." 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors claim that the deputies, along with other members of an 
elite sheriff's narcotics investigations team targeted by the FBI sting, stole 
a total of $48,000 of the $498,000 in marked money that night, and at one 
point, jurors saw another video excerpt of deputies questioning the suspected 
drug dealer in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
As the officers searched the room, the video showed Deputy Nancy A. Brown 
discovering hundreds of thousands dollars in cash hidden in a garment bag. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh ho ho -- Is this your bag?" Brown asked the undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Brown and Sobel were seen questioning the undercover agent about where 
he got the money and urging him to sign a disclaimer saying the money did not 
belong to him. 
</P>
<P>
"(You) can say room service left it," Sobel quipped. 
</P>
<P>
With Sobel now a prosecution witness and both Brown and Deputy Michael J. 
Kaliterna -- who also appears on tape searching the hotel room -- not scheduled 
for trial until January, the only defendants shown on the video are Bauder and 
Garner. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow defendants Terrell H. Amers and Ronald E. Daub were outside the hotel at 
the time, and another defendant, Deputy John C. Dickenson, was in a 
surveillance helicopter. Deputy Eufrasio G. Cortez, who had been working with 
the Internal Revenue Service on another money-laundering investigation, was 
never involved in the sting and raid. But Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. 
Hagemann maintained that all the deputies, and Sobel, shared in the profits 
from the sting. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the seventh deputy on trial, Macario M. Duran, had received 
money from an earlier theft. Duran's wife, Maria, also a defendant, had helped 
hide the source of stolen drug cash through a series of financial transactions, 
Hagemann said. 
</P>
<P>
The tape drew little visible reaction from the jurors, who also listened to a 
parade of government witnesses describe the sting and alleged evidence that 
prosecutors said was found in the homes of deputies tied to drug money thefts 
</P>
<P>
But in one surprise, Garner's attorney, Harland Braun, suggested that the 
federal government itself might be involved in massive money-skimming 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Braun asked one FBI agent whether he was aware of any investigations into 
reports that the federal government had laundered money for drug dealers and 
funneled some of the profits for clandestine operations overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The agent denied knowing anything about such operations. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Braun told reporters that Garner would testify that the government 
laundered drug profits that were then diverted by the CIA to both the 
Nicaraguan Contras and to Iran for weapons purchases. Braun declined to 
elaborate.

CITY COUNCIL SETS MAJOR GOALS IN POLICY ON AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: LAWMAKERS SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT INCLUDES GIVING CONDOMS TO PRISONERS 
AND BLEACH TO DRUG USERS. BUT COOPERATION FROM COUNTY AND STATE IS NEEDED TO 
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a sweeping AIDS policy that 
requires comprehensive AIDS education for all city workers and endorses a 
number of nationally controversial measures, including the distribution of 
condoms to prisoners during incarceration and bleach to drug users for 
sterilizing needles. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, largely the work of the city's retired AIDS coordinator, Dave 
Johnson, passed by an 11-1 vote. Proponents on the council called it a landmark 
policy, bringing together in a single document the myriad regulations and 
principles spawned by the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Even its backers acknowledged that implementation of much of the policy will 
require widespread cooperation of county and state officials -- by no means 
assured -- as well as increases in funding. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the AIDS crisis a "natural disaster and a global emergency," the 
document emphasized the rights of those infected with the AIDS virus and the 
need to avoid public hysteria in efforts to contain the virus' spread. It also 
contains nitty-gritty sections on how to clean up spills of potentially 
infected blood or body fluids and exactly who can say what to whom in the 
process of protecting the confidentiality of infected persons. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, the policy's principal sponsor, said he expects it to 
serve as a model for municipal, county and state governments nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the AIDS policy becomes a blueprint for other governing bodies is more 
than an issue of pride. Many of the policy's goals cannot be implemented unless 
county and state governments adopt them, too. 
</P>
<P>
The jails are controlled by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Twice, 
the supervisors have gone on record against public distribution of condoms and 
bleach to addicts and others at risk of HIV infection, rejecting the advice of 
their advisory commission on AIDS. The issue of giving condoms to prisoners has 
not come up, but aides to the most outspoken opponents of condoms and bleach, 
Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich, said the city's policy declarations are 
unlikely to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Another area where county support is critical to implementation of the city's 
goals is in the treatment of HIV infection. The policy calls for timely access 
to care for all HIV-infected people, regardless of their ability to pay. But 
the county hospital and health-care system is so overcrowded that patients 
seeking an appointment in the outpatient AIDS clinic at County-USC Medical 
Center must wait 21 weeks, according to county health officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is, 'Where is the money for it?' " said Rand Schrader, a Los Angeles 
Municipal Court judge who is chairman of the Los Angeles County Commission on 
AIDS. "The federal government has not provided money that the county or the 
state can use to do that. It ought to be done -- morally, it should be done -- 
but at this point the money just isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
The city's chief monetary obligation under the policy is to hire health 
educators to implement AIDS education programs for the city's 33,000 employees, 
according to Phill Wilson, the incoming city AIDS coordinator. In addition, the 
$1 million allocated by the city to provide housing for homeless AIDS patients 
will probably grow as the epidemic grows. About half of the 112,000 county 
residents believed infected with HIV live in Los Angeles, city officials 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs acknowledged that much of what the document advocates requires action 
outside the city's jurisdiction. He contended that the city still must play a 
leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a step in the city trying to come to grips with the problem even though 
it by no means solves the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David I. Schulman of the city attorney's office, who helped draft the policy, 
said one of its chief attributes is the melding of educational programs about 
the transmission of AIDS and training in the legal protections for people who 
are infected. 
</P>
<P>
The policy also stipulates that the city use existing community-based AIDS 
programs to confront the epidemic rather than set up its own programs. Schulman 
described that as a key philosophical underpinning of the policy, recognizing 
that community groups are just as important in the fight against AIDS as 
governmental action. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi was the only one to vote against the policy, calling 
its guarantees of confidentiality for those with HIV a "cop-out" that strips 
health officials of their main weapon in combatting an epidemic: knowing who is 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
Also opposed were about 10 demonstrators from a group called the Coalition for 
Common Sense, who picketed in front of City Hall and later spoke against the 
policy at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian Asensio, spokesman for the group, said city workers ought to be able to 
know which of their co-workers are infected so they can protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS policy also contains a legislative agenda, putting the city on record 
on a number of issues surrounding AIDS. As part of the agenda, the city 
endorses the distribution of bleach and condoms. It also declares opposition to 
U.S. immigration policies that restrict entry of HIV-infected people, opposes 
mandatory testing beyond what the law now permits, favors expansion of AIDS 
education in elementary, secondary and college curriculums, and calls for more 
services for women and minorities who have been under-served by AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
City departments have six months to figure out how to implement the policy. The 
city personnel department must come up with an estimate on what implementation 
will cost for all departments, while the community development department has 
been charged with estimating the policy's long-term fiscal implications.

Dan Brickman of Hollywood received a renewal of his driver's license in the 
mail the other day -- along with the licenses of people named Pineda, 
Shannigan, Natividad, Brodie, Donan, Park, Morra, Manchame and Rahimian. 
</P>
<P>
Ten licenses in all. Note the obvious similarities in the spelling. 
</P>
<P>
"When I phoned the DMV they told me to mail them the licenses," Brickman said. 
"I told them maybe they should send someone to pick them up. And they said, 
'Why don't you just keep them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is the DMV's method of reducing traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it simply has bought another new computer. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of computer foul-ups, a Christmasy-sounding letter was sent out to 
"Mr. Santa M. Neighborhood" on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The resident at the address is the Santa Monica Neighborhood Support Center.

The product being advertised was a computer.

It may seem like a quaint concept today, inasmuch as we've passed through the

Library, came upon a truly forgotten city street: 
</P>
<P>
Lovers Lane. 
</P>
<P>
An 1871 map shows it running north and south along what is now a railroad track 
just north of Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
Author Harris Newmark ("Sixty Years in Southern California") described it as 
"willowed and deep with dust" (make of that what you will). 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, as Creason commented, it's "not a real prime spot for lovers to park 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, records show that the name was changed in 1877, perhaps by a 
prudish official. 
</P>
<P>
The new name: Date Street. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all romantic signs have disappeared in this busy-busy-busy era. Take

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : INMATE HURT IN SCUFFLE WITH 5 SHERIFF'S 
DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An inmate injured in a struggle with five deputies at the Hall of Justice Jail 
in downtown Los Angeles was reported in guarded condition Tuesday as the 
Sheriff's Department suspended one deputy and opened an investigation of the 
incident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joaquin Herran said that when inmate Michael Frlekin, 26, of San Pedro 
began acting in a "bizarre" manner Monday, a deputy pulled him from a line of 
inmates heading for dinner and escorted him to an adjacent area. 
</P>
<P>
According to Herran, Frlekin attacked the deputy, who called for aid and was 
joined by four deputies in subduing the inmate. After the scuffle, Frlekin was 
hospitalized at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
One of the deputies -- whose name was not released -- was suspended with pay, 
pending an internal investigation, Herran said. 
</P>
<P>
Frlekin had been arrested in February for assault with a deadly weapon and 
escape, Herran said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : CHARGE AGAINST FATHER IN FATAL CRASH 
DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the request of prosecutors who believed the man had suffered enough, a judge 
Tuesday dismissed a manslaughter charge against a father whose 6-year-old son 
died in a car accident because he was not wearing his seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Alan Rosenfield dismissed the charge against Walter G. 
Sylvia Jr., 49, of Malibu, on a motion filed by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia will still be prosecuted on charges of driving with a suspended license, 
a misdemeanor, and violating the state's seat belt law, an infraction. He is 
scheduled to be arraigned in Municipal Court on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia's son, Michael, was killed Aug. 8 when he was thrown from the open 
passenger window of his father's 1983 Honda, which overturned on Soledad Canyon 
Road north of Aqua Dulce Canyon Road in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia had been charged with manslaughter, which carries a one-year jail 
sentence.

DOLLS COME FULL CIRCLE -- AS GIFT TO POLICE 
</P>

She was four feet tall, dressed neatly in a print smock and Oxford shoes, and 
she was being unceremoniously thrown over the hood of a car on Hoover Street 
near the USC campus when a traffic officer mistook her for a child being 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Charlton's dolls were getting involved with the police -- again. 
</P>
<P>
The officer recognized his mistake and told the woman, who was unloading a 
trunk full of the black, handmade, Raggedy Ann-type dolls from her car, that 
the toys would be appreciated by young victims who are brought to the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Abused Child Unit. The suggestion led to a donation 
of 50 dolls to the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The contribution by Joyce White, a distributor for Charlton's House of Dolls 
'N' Things, was ironic, given the decade-long, contentious relationship between 
the dolls' maker and Los Angeles authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Toy maker Charlton, known to many as the "Doll Baby Man" from South Los 
Angeles, said that since the early '80s, he has experienced several unwarranted 
arrests on charges of loitering and selling without a permit. One time, 
Charlton said, narcotics detectives knifed open a dozen of his 10-inch dolls, 
expecting to find cocaine concealed inside. They found none. 
</P>
<P>
Times change, Charlton acknowledged. White added that the donation will benefit 
child-abuse victims who need the comfort a huggable doll can bring. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually children who have been physically or sexually abused are brought to us 
without anything except for the clothes on their back," said Juvenile Division 
Detective Bobby Smith. "The dolls help ease some of the pain of what they've 
gone through. It's nice to have something for them just to hold on to -- to 
cling to." JOHN H. LEE

NATIONWIDE COCAINE RING DISMANTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A narcotics ring that shipped cocaine across the country has been dismantled, 
authorities said Tuesday in announcing the seizure of a nearly $80-million 
cache of the drug and the arrests of seven Cuban natives. 
</P>
<P>
The ring, in what has become a commonplace practice, was believed to have 
smuggled its cocaine across the Mexican border by trucks that dropped their 
cargo in Los Angeles, where the drugs were then shipped across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 1,400 pounds of cocaine, valued on the street at about $79.5 
million, were seized, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure was made after a joint investigation involving the Los Angeles 
Police Department, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they believe the ring had been smuggling cocaine "for some 
time," but there were no precise estimates on when it began operations and no 
indication of how much of the drug it had been responsible for bringing into 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began in the summer, after a CHP officer trained to detect 
drug-carrying commercial vehicles became suspicious of a tractor-trailer rig 
owned by Moonlight Trucking Co. of Alma, Ark., Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8 the same officer made a traffic stop of a Moonlight rig in Burbank 
and discovered nearly 700 pounds of cocaine stuffed into a hidden compartment 
in the truck's sleeper berth. Two men were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said those men, identified as Olvido Linares Jr., 22, of Miami, and 
Silvano Acosta, 23, of Hialeah, Fla., served primarily as drivers in the 
operation and were allegedly paid $200 for every kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) of 
the drug they transported. 
</P>
<P>
Within five days, the CHP, together with the DEA and Los Angeles police, 
stopped a second Moonlight rig near Desert Center in Riverside County, 175 
miles from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 630 pounds of cocaine were seized. Two men -- Joseph Alvarez, 45, and 
Rene Reyes Montenegro, 44, both of Miami -- were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation then moved to Newark, N.J., where on Saturday authorities 
arrested Jacinto Diaz, 25, and Ricardo Alvarez-Perez, 43, both of Miami, and 
Pedro Pedrianes-Valinda, 20, of Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz was identified as the owner of the trucking company and a "key player" in 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities declined to say who masterminded the operation.

NO DECLINE NOTED IN HOSPITAL CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: BUT RAND CORP. AND UCLA RESEARCHERS ALSO SAY MORE ELDERLY WERE 
DISCHARGED IN 'AN UNSTABLE CONDITION' UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW PAYMENT 
METHOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1983 change in the method of paying hospitals under Medicare "did not 
interrupt" a long-term trend toward better hospital care for the nation's 
elderly, according to an extensive study by researchers at the Santa 
Monica-based RAND Corp. and UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
But the team, led by Dr. Katherine L. Kahn and Dr. Robert H. Brook, found that 
some of the gains in hospital care were lost because the changed payment method 
"has increased the likelihood that a patient will be discharged home in an 
unstable condition." 
</P>
<P>
Eight articles based on the RAND study are being published in today's issue of 
the Journal of the American Medical Assn. The Times reported most of the major 
RAND findings in April, 1989, when they were presented at a medical meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of patients judged to have received "poor" or "very poor" 
hospital care decreased from 25% in 1981-82, before the change, to 12% in 
1985-86, after the change, Kahn said. But the percentage of patients sent home 
with at least one "instability" increased from about 10% to about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly patients discharged with rapid heart beat, confusion or other 
instabilities have higher death rates within 90 days of discharge than patients 
without such problems, the researchers determined. 
</P>
<P>
Under the "prospective payment system," Medicare pays hospitals a fixed sum, 
set in advance, for each patient who is admitted. Previously, under a 
"fee-for-service" system," hospitals had billed Medicare for each service they 
performed. The goal of the new system is to cut costs while maintaining quality 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.9-million, four-year RAND study involved a detailed review of the 
medical records of 14,012 patients. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kahn cautioned that since data collection was completed in 
1986, "the financial screws on hospitals have been tightened." She added, "I 
really don't know what the quality of care is like now," and called for 
continuing studies. 
</P>
<P>
Gail R. Wilensky, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, 
which is responsible for Medicare and which funded the study, took heart in the 
RAND conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial for the medical journal, Wilensky said the findings "should 
inspire caution in those critics who have attributed most recent hospital 
problems to the prospective payment system and who would have unhesitatingly 
attributed decreased quality to (the payment system)." But Wilensky 
acknowledged that improvements in quality of care for the elderly do "not 
appear to be directly attributable to the (changed payment system)." 
</P>
<P>
The patients studied had one of five conditions common in the elderly -- 
congestive heart failure, heart attack, pneumonia, stroke or hip fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Among other findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Elderly patients admitted to the hospital after the change in payment system 
tended to be sicker than those admitted to the hospital before the change. 
</P>
<P>
* As of 30 days after hospital admission, the overall death rates were similar 
-- 16.4% in 1981-82 and 15.4% in 1985-86. By 180 days after hospital admission, 
29.6% of of the patients studied in 1981-82 were dead, compared to 29.2% of the 
patients studied in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
* Medicare patients judged to have received "very good" quality of care had a 
17% mortality rate as of 30 days after hospital admission, compared to a 30% 
mortality rate for patients judged to have received "very poor" quality of 
care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1983, the federal government changed the way it paid hospitals 
under the Medicare program, which insures the elderly and disabled. The change 
raised concerns that the quality of hospital care would decline. Previously, 
under a "fee-for-service" system, hospitals made their own decisions on 
treatment of elderly patients, and then billed Medicare. Since 1983, Medicare 
has paid hospitals a fixed sum, set in advance, for each patient. The goals of 
this "prospective payment system" are to encourage efficient medical care while 
discouraging prolonged hospital stays and excessive tests and treatments.

SLAIN WOMAN'S SON FAULTS BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM and ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tearful son of a La Canada Flintridge woman allegedly killed by her 
mentally ill daughter told a joint legislative committee Tuesday that he 
repeatedly tried to obtain treatment for his sister but failed because the 
state's bureaucratic system would not provide it. 
</P>
<P>
"Legally, people have the civil right to be mentally ill and lead 
less-than-human lives on the streets," said Brian Jacobs of Long Beach, who 
broke down emotionally several times during testimony in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"How many times have you passed a mentally ill person on the street, walked by 
this person and looked aside because you were afraid that they might accost 
you?" he asked. "That is a terrible indictment of the (mental health treatment) 
system. My mother was a beautiful, stately woman. She didn't deserve this." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' comments came several hours before his sister made her first court 
appearance on charges that she murdered her mother, Roma Jaul Jacobs, 78, who 
was stabbed and shot to death Sunday night in her home. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Victoria Elizabeth Jacobs Madeira, 43, smiled briefly in talking 
with her public defender, but made no statement as her arraignment was 
postponed until Tuesday by Glendale Municipal Judge Barbara Lee Burke. 
</P>
<P>
She and her 11-year-old son were arrested in her mother's yard Sunday night, 
with Madeira wearing military fatigues and her son dressed as a girl, according 
to sheriff's deputies and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how Madeira, who Jacobs said has been institutionalized on 
occasion since being diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic two decades ago, 
obtained the weapons -- four handguns and several knives -- allegedly used in 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment for Madeira's son is set for today in Pasadena Juvenile Court. 
Because of confidentiality laws protecting minors, William Gerth, the director 
of juvenile intake at the Los Angeles County Probation Department, said, "We 
can't say much about the boy's case . . . except that the district attorney 
felt that there was enough evidence to warrant arraignment." 
</P>
<P>
One person who knows the Jacobs family said she was not altogether shocked at 
news of the slaying. Montrose seamstress Lyzetta Edie, 73, who described 
herself as a close friend and confidante of Madeira since the early 1960s, said 
she got a call about three weeks ago from the suspect, who said she was 
distraught about relations with her family and their efforts to take away her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
She quoted Madeira as saying: "I don't know how long I can stand this. They 
won't get off my back. They just want (the boy)." 
</P>
<P>
Edie said Madeira never got along with her family and felt as if she could do 
little to please them. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty had been pushed to the very limit," Edie said of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
On March 17, Anaheim police had gone to a pickup truck parked across from the 
local YMCA to serve a child custody order on a woman using the name Elizabeth 
Jaul Jacobs, 42, Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgepeth said. 
</P>
<P>
A court had ordered the woman to turn over her son to an uncle other than Brian 
Jacobs. But the mother "became verbally defensive, would not allow the boy to 
be released, and claimed he had been sexually molested," Hedgepeth said. 
</P>
<P>
The lieutenant said the boy became "extremely upset" about leaving his mother, 
and was eventually placed by Orange County officials in an unidentified group 
home. The boy was on leave from the group home at the time of the slaying, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sacramento hearing, state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who chairs 
the Health and Services Committee, said a new state law calls for a special 
task force to put together a revised master plan for mental health treatment 
services. "The system is broken and broken very badly," she conceded. "We 
commit ourselves to trying to put the system back together again." 
</P>
<P>
In recounting his own struggles to get assistance from the system, Jacobs told 
lawmakers Tuesday: "I tried everything. I called every agency. There was 
nothing -- zero." 
</P>
<P>
Several mental health experts contacted Tuesday said the Madeira case is "a 
highly predictable result" of an overtaxed and underfunded system that 
generally requires a mentally ill person to commit a violent act before he can 
be legally committed involuntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to deteriorate to the point where they prove they are dangerous," 
said Rael Jean Isaac, co-author of a recent book that criticizes trends in 
psychiatric law. "It's bitterly unfair to them as much as it is to the public 
who suffers." 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of his testimony, Jacobs said softly, "I still love my 
sister." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said that Jacobs' appearances Tuesday and at a similar hearing Monday in 
Los Angeles were not staged or planned for publicity purposes. "The tragedy 
just happened on the eve of the hearing," she said. 
</P>

staff writers Tammerlin Drummond and Sonni Efron in Orange County contributed

LAWSUIT ACCUSES RICK DEES, RADIO STATION OF SEX BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: FORMER ON-AIR PARTNER CLAIMS SHE WAS TARGET OF JOKES. SHE CONTENDS SHE 
WAS FIRED BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO FAMILY ORIENTED AND NOT ALLURING ENOUGH TO SUIT 
HER SIDEKICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The former sidekick to popular morning radio personality Rick Dees filed a 
lawsuit Tuesday alleging that she was fired because the station perceived her 
as too family oriented and not young or sexy enough to suit Dees. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Fulton, who was let go from her job at KIIS-FM about six months ago, also 
contends in the suit that she was often the object of Dees' on-air sexual jokes 
while employed at the station. Dees frequently referred to her on the air as 
Liz (Rugburn) Fulton, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel hurt because of this," Fulton, a mother of two, said Tuesday. "I 
don't want men to get away with this in radio or in any other business." 
</P>
<P>
Fulton's complaint against Dees and KIIS-FM owner Gannett Co., Inc. was filed 
in Los Angeles Superior Court by attorney Gloria Allred. The suit, which seeks 
unspecified damages, alleges sex discrimination, breach of contract and 
invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Dees, who also is host of a late-night television talk show, could not be 
reached for comment. Gannett Radio President Jay Cook declined to comment until 
the station had more time to review Fulton's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton, 37, said she went to work at KIIS in 1979 as a news anchor and joined 
Dees on the air when he arrived at the station in 1981. She left in 1984 to 
work for a small station in Northern California and have her first child, she 
said, and then rejoined KIIS in 1987 to become Dees' on-air sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, shortly after Fulton visited the station with her two 
children in June, 1989, Dees began to believe Fulton was "too matronly and not 
young, sexy or beautiful enough to appear with him at promotions or remote 
broadcast locations." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleges that in 1988, Dees appeared on Wally George's "Hot Seat" 
television talk show accompanied by a buxom woman dressed in a bikini. The 
woman, who was led off the stage in handcuffs, was falsely introduced as 
Fulton, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton said that when she was fired in April, she was told only that she did 
not fit into the station's long-range plans. She now works at another radio 
station as a weekend news anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"She believes that she was terminated because she was perceived as too old and 
family orientated and not sufficiently sexy enough," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton said she and Dees hardly spoke to each other unless they were on the 
air. She said she did not complain to Dees or station management about the 
sexual jokes because she feared she would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't feel like risking my job over it when he called me Liz 
(Rugburn) Fulton," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fulton also said she knew nothing of Dees' appearance on the George show with 
the woman falsely identified as herself until a radio listener called her in 
late 1989 after the episode had been rerun. She said she did not view a 
videotape of the show until after she was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't funny, I know what comedy is," Fulton said. "It hurt my 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Allred contended that Fulton's experiences at KIIS are common in the 
male-dominated broadcasting industry, where women are forced into stereotyped 
roles and risk losing their jobs if they speak out. 
</P>
<P>
"No woman should have to fit into a sexist and ageist stereotype of a female in 
order to keep her job," Allred said.

INSURER DONATIONS TO WILLIE BROWN ATTACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurers gave at least $45,600 to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's campaign 
against two legislative term-limit initiatives within weeks of the passage of 
legislation exempting surety insurance from regulations imposed by Proposition 
103, Voter Revolt Chairman Harvey Rosenfield said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield called for a federal corruption probe of the matter and charged that 
"the campaign against term limits is being waged by the politicians bought and 
paid for by insurance companies and other special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103, the voter-approved insurance 
initiative, also asserted that the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian acted 
illegally in approving the exemption of the surety companies. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's press secretary, Michael Reese, responded, "This attack is a reach even 
for the likes of Harvey Rosenfield. Clearly, Mr. Rosenfield is playing 
connect-the-dots politics. In this case, the dots do not and should not 
connect." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield noted that one clause of Proposition 103 prohibits the Legislature 
from changing the measure unless doing so furthers the purposes of the 
initiative. Exempting the highly profitable, $225-million-a-year surety 
insurance business from the rollback and rate regulation provisions of 
Proposition 103 does not further its purposes, he contended. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield Tuesday asked Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to ignore the 
exemption pending a court test of its validity. 
</P>
<P>
Surety insurers provide a financial guarantee that a party, such as a 
construction company, will perform the work they have promised to do on a 
project. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year that insurance industry sources have been 
accused of furthering their political agenda by giving to initiative campaigns 
not strictly related to insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary campaign, insurers gave more than $300,000 to efforts to pass 
Proposition 115, the anti-crime initiative. At that time, critics charged that 
the insurers' real aim was to ingratiate themselves with the gubernatorial 
campaign of Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, while not embarrassing Wilson by 
giving directly to him. Wilson was the prime sponsor of the measure. Rosenfield 
noted that the measure to exempt the surety insurers from Proposition 103 
quietly passed through the Legislature on unanimous votes in August and was 
signed by the governor Aug. 24. Many of the insurer donations to Brown's 
campaign against the term limits -- Propositions 131 and 140 -- came between 
Sept. 10 and 12.

POLICE SAY CUBAN COKE RING BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

California law enforcement officials said Tuesday they had broken up a 
cross-country drug distribution ring run by a Cuban organization and 
confiscated approximately 1,400 pounds of cocaine valued at $22 million on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian-produced cocaine was found in two big-rig trucks -- one stopped 
in Burbank where the drug was discovered in a secret compartment, the other 
seized in Blythe in Riverside County, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Cuban nationals were arrested locally and in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was displayed at a news conference held at Parker Center by 
officials from three law enforcement agencies that worked on the case, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, CHP Commissioner Maury Hannigan and Mike Holm, 
assistant special agent in charge of the DEA's Los Angeles office, said the 
cocaine entered the United States from Mexico. They declined to say where it 
had crossed the border. 
</P>
<P>
The trucking firm, which called itself Moonlighting Trucking Co. of Alma, Ark., 
was "a sham" designed to haul cocaine coast to coast, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizures did not represent anything near the multi-ton quantities of 
cocaine that have been confiscated in the past year in the Los Angeles area, 
which narcotics officials say is the nation's top cocaine distribution center. 
Earlier this month, more than 7,700 pounds of cocaine were seized in a propane 
tanker at a customs checkpoint near San Diego. A record 21 tons were seized 
last year in a Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still a tremendous problem of cocaine coming into the U.S.," Holm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, Cuban drug dealers would smuggle narcotics through Florida. 
However, as a result of a law enforcement crackdown in Florida, a significant 
shift occurred a few years ago in trafficking patterns, officials said.

COUPLE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH; TODDLER CRITICALLY WOUNDED; 
</P>
<P>
SLAYINGS: POLICE CALL INCIDENT A MURDER-SUICIDE. HUSBAND AND WIFE REPORTEDLY 
HAD ARGUED FREQUENTLY OVER HIS EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR.

A couple who police said spent more than a year arguing frequently over the 
husband's continuing extramarital affair, were found shot to death in their 
Hollywood apartment Tuesday. Their 16-month-old son, wounded in the head, lay 
between them on their bed. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, Anthony Rodriguez, was reported in critical condition at Childrens 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the incident appeared to be the third murder-suicide 
since May involving a couple in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives found Leticia Peralta, 29, and Hector Rodriguez, 31, in their 
one-bedroom apartment in the 1800 block of North Kingsley Drive. A 
small-caliber automatic pistol was found near Peralta, said Hollywood Division 
Lt. Bob Ruchhoft. Peralta, Rodriguez and the baby apparently had each been shot 
once in the head, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Rodriguez told investigators that Peralta became distraught last 
year when she learned that her husband was seeing another woman. Rodriguez, who 
worked as a janitor, refused to end the relationship and he and Peralta argued 
frequently, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Peralta also began threatening to kill her husband, said Luis Romero, 25, who 
identified himself as a close friend of Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"He was saying he was going to leave his wife," Romero said of Rodriguez, who 
immigrated to the United States 11 years ago from Guatemala. "When she 
(Peralta) was angry, she said she would kill Hector. He used to joke about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez and Peralta, who worked as a housekeeper, had been married for about 
18 months, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, a man shot and killed his estranged wife and a daughter, wounded a 
second daughter, then killed himself in an apartment on Ardmore Avenue. In 
August, a few blocks away from the scene of Tuesday's shooting, a butcher, who 
was reportedly consumed by jealousy, fatally stabbed the woman he lived with, 
then shot to death his three children before killing himself.

The craft of sports publicity took a step forward last week when Bob Anderson, 
the sports information director at Northeast Louisiana University, sent a 
letter to all opponents and the news media. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Anderson: "The name of our university is Northeast Louisiana University. 
It is not NE Louisiana. It is not Northeast State. It is not NE La. It is not 
Northeastern Louisiana. It is not NELU. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I request. I ask humbly and earnestly. I beseech. I petition. I entreat. I 
implore. I beg you on bended knee -- please don't call us NE Louisiana." 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the letter, he identified himself as "NLU SID." Anderson 
explained that if an abbreviation is necessary, NLU is acceptable.

Trivia time: Name the only current major league team that has never finished in

The Columbia Seven: Dave Parry, supervisor of officials for the Big Ten 
conference, discussing the officials' failure to call pass interference on 
Michigan's two-point conversion attempt in the closing seconds of a 28-27 loss 
to Michigan State Saturday, brought up Colorado's disputed victory at Missouri 
a week earlier when the Buffaloes scored a touchdown when given an extra play. 
</P>
<P>
Parry told Times Sports Editor Bill Dwyre: "It's really too bad, but those 
seven guys (who missed Colorado's "fifth down") helped every football official 
in the United States more than they know. Every official on every field in 
America is counting every down twice." 
</P>
<P>
Can't hurt: Walking off the field after his team upset Arkansas Saturday, Texas 
Tech Coach Spike Dykes saw a penny on the goal line. So he did what any 
clear-headed, 2-4 coach would do. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing bad can happen from picking up a penny," Dykes said. "I'm 
superstitious. There is no telling what might happen to this team now." 
</P>
<P>
When the Red Raiders play Rice this Saturday, the penny will be inside Dykes' 
left shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss watch fails: Maybe Henri Nuoffer, chief warden of the Bellechasse jail in 
Fribourg, Switzerland, could help revive the athletic shoe company ads that 
read: "There is no finish line." 
</P>
<P>
Nuoffer allowed two inmates -- each convicted on drug offenses, each serving 
30-month terms and each eligible for release in January -- to run in Sunday's 
17-kilometer Murten-Fribourg Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Police are looking for the inmates, who finished the race and kept running.

Vic Wertz drove to deep center field, where Willie Mays made his famous

B. F. Goodrich Co.: Third-quarter net income was $50.6 million, up 26% from the 
same quarter of 1989. Sales increased 6% to $634.5 million. The Akron, 
Ohio-based vinyl resins and specialty chemicals company said its increased 
earnings reflected the favorable net effect of several one-time items, 
including the resolution of a tax issue with the Internal Revenue Service, 
which reduced tax expense and benefited net income by $30.8 million.

Occidental Petroleum Corp.: The Los Angeles-based oil, natural gas and 
agribusiness concern posted third-quarter profit of $109 million, about the 
same as a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled $5.4 billion, a gain of 13%. The results were attributed to 
improvement in oil and gas, natural gas transmission, agribusiness and coal 
operations. The figures also included an after-tax charge of $16 million 
associated with the previously announced settlement in the Wyoming Tight Sands 
litigation, partially offset by an after-tax gain of $8 million from the sale 
of domestic gas properties. A net loss of $2 million was recorded due to the 
early retirement of debt, which was partially offset by a federal income tax 
benefit.

'BIG GREEN' BATTLE CENTERS ON COST OF A CLEANER STATE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: IN MANY CASES PROPOSITION 128 SIMPLY SETS GUIDELINES. PRICE TAG 
FORECASTS VARY WIDELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN and RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that Proposition 128, widely known as "Big Green," 
will save Californians $87 billion in energy and health costs in 20 years and 
at the same time cleanse coastal waters and save redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
Industry argues that the environmental initiative will cost Californians 
several billion dollars a year and produce huge increases in the price of 
gasoline, a surge in electricity rates and a rise in food prices. 
</P>
<P>
These wildly different -- and to voters, maddeningly befuddling -- forecasts 
are central to the debate over the sweeping environmental proposition and two 
rival, industry-backed initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, the disparate views of what Proposition 128 would do -- and how 
much it would cost -- stem from differing sets of assumptions about the future 
and human nature. The measure, in many cases, simply sets guidelines or goals 
and requires state officials to find ways to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
Those who argue that the costs would be reasonable believe alternative 
technologies are available at competitive prices to replace pollutants. These 
supporters also assume that consumers would adjust their behavior and conserve 
energy without being throttled by large price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents take none of this for granted. They contend that people do not change 
without strong incentives. Alternative technologies are inadequate, these 
critics say, and state officials will have to resort to costly measures to 
enact the law. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I can see it, economic growth probably will be slower than it would 
be otherwise," said Frederick Cannon, chief economist for Bank of America. "But 
it's unlikely, depending on how it's implemented, that (Proposition 128) would 
cause some kind of downturn in the state economy by itself." 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with dozens of government officials, economists, energy experts, 
university professors and agricultural experts tend to portray a 
post-Proposition 128 situation in which there would be short-term losses: 
higher costs for some products and for manufacturing companies, the oil and gas 
industry and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
In the long term, many of these analysts say, the economy would be stronger 
because of improved energy efficiency. Air would be cleaner and public health 
might improve. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, dubbed the "Hayden initiative" by opponents, is sponsored by 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), environmental groups and Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp. Oil, chemical and manufacturing companies oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
"The main long-run effect (on the economy) will be to change the composition of 
growth in favor of less-polluting industry and companies that produce things 
that combat pollution," said Roger Noll, director of the public policy program 
at Stanford University. "I also think it's going to cause the population growth 
of the state to be much lower than it would be otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative is designed to remove toxics from food, water and air and would 
create an elected office of environmental advocate to ensure protection. 
</P>
<P>
Litigation could tie up parts of the measure if it is enacted. Industry, which 
dislikes several of the proposition's provisions, is particularly troubled by a 
requirement that California reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 
40% -- probably closer to 32% if population projections are correct -- by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide, produced by the burning of fossil fuels, is the biggest 
contributor to global warming. Many scientists believe that it and other gases 
will cause major climatic disruptions in the decades ahead. 
</P>
<P>
To help reach the targeted cut, the initiative would save redwoods and require 
builders to plant and maintain one tree for every 500 square feet of new 
construction. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, and if planted near buildings, could 
reduce heating and air-conditioning costs. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the initiative would trim the world's carbon dioxide by less than 
1%, according to opponents. Proposition 128's backers hope other states and 
nations follow California's example. Already, several countries have pledged 
major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Germany, for example, plans to 
cut its emissions by 25% by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
"The carbon dioxide provisions strike me as being very challenging and very 
tough," said Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California Energy Commission, 
which would have to establish regulations to meet the target. 
</P>
<P>
"But I certainly cannot say from an intellectually honest perspective (that) 
they are impossible." 
</P>
<P>
The goals could be obtained without hefty gas taxes, escalating electrical 
rates or nuclear power because alternative technology is available to reduce 
energy consumption, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether the public is ready to accept it," said Imbrecht, a 
Gov. George Deukmejian appointee. "Not everybody wants to drive a Honda Civic." 
</P>
<P>
Contending that the bulk of reductions must come from transportation, Imbrecht 
suggests strategies such as granting rebates to drivers of more efficient 
vehicles or assessing higher fees to those who drive gas guzzlers. 
</P>
<P>
State vehicle design requirements also would have to be changed in a way that 
would produce more fuel-efficient cars without infringing on the federal 
government's sole authority to set miles-per-gallon standards, he said. For 
example, state officials recently spurred future production of clean-fuel cars 
by approving the world's toughest tailpipe emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, largely agrees with Imbrecht. Meeting the initiative's emissions 
goals "will not be easy, but it (won't be) the kind of Armageddon you hear 
presented on some of the advertisements against it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we are talking about huge sacrifices. We are talking more 
about technology changes, more fuel-efficient cars, fuels that create less 
carbon dioxide . . . more efficient power plants, more efficient lighting at 
homes, more efficiency in factories," Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University's Noll, who said he intends to vote against the measure, 
argues that the targeted reductions would hit poor people hardest because 
low-income residents tend to drive older cars that consume more gasoline and 
have less choice about where they live. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Southern California Edison Co. said that Proposition 128 does 
not allow the business community to reduce emissions in the least costly way. 
California is already more energy efficient than the rest of the country, and 
squeezing out the required reductions in carbon dioxide is possible but 
expensive, said Michael Hertel, manager of Edison's environmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Why not allow California companies to go to Central America and plant 100,000 
acres of trees at 100th of the cost?" Hertel said. 
</P>
<P>
Even a sponsor of the initiative warns that costs required to meet the 
emissions target might seem overwhelming initially. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first two years, you might say it's devastating because the costs are 
front-loaded," said Christopher Calwell, research associate with the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, a sponsor of the initiative. "I really discourage 
short-term thinking here." 
</P>
<P>
Light bulbs are often cited as an example of the kind of trade-off Proposition 
128 would ask Californians to make. 
</P>
<P>
An energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulb costs as much as $15 to $25 
to purchase, compared to the commonly used 75-cent incandescent, said Rick 
Heede, a research associate at Rocky Mountain Institute, which researches 
resource efficiency issues. But over the lifetime of the fluorescent, he said, 
consumers will save about $40 in electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The impact on agriculture also could be severe in the short run if farmers do 
not prepare for a phase-out of many pesticides. The initiative would ban -- in 
most cases within five to eight years -- pesticides on food if they cause 
cancer or birth defects and set aside $20 million for research into 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticide regulation, now in the hands of California's Department of Food and 
Agriculture, would be shifted partially to the Department of Health Services. 
Environmentalists have complained that the agriculture department is more 
concerned with farmers than with public health. 
</P>
<P>
"The short-term impacts are going to be pretty grave," said Otto Doering, 
professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. "As time goes on, 
lots of things happen to make adjustments. Farmers learn to do things 
differently, consumers may decide they don't want as much of a certain product, 
and farmers may find new or different chemicals" or learn to farm without them. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the outcome depends on how the measure is interpreted. Critics contend 
that one provision could ban about 65% of all pesticides. Supporters, conceding 
the language may be unclear, argue that the opponents are misinterpreting that 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
If the provisions are interpreted according to the environmentalists' intent 
and substitutes are available, the pesticide section could have "little 
impact," Doering said. But he does not believe the changes will be painless. 
</P>
<P>
"I think California is probably going to have to suffer some food price 
increases," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrie Mott, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
insists that the phase-out provisions will give farmers plenty of time to find 
substitutes. Many already exist for the targeted chemicals used on several 
crops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Like other environmentalists, Mott points to previous predictions of crop 
losses and price increases that did not occur when other pesticides were banned 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Voters who do not like the pesticide provisions of Proposition 128 could cancel 
them by voting for Proposition 135, a measure backed by farmers that would 
increase testing for pesticide residues on food but leave regulation in the 
hands of the Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
That measure, not surprisingly, is strongly opposed by environmental groups. If 
it gets one more vote than Proposition 128, current pesticide regulations would 
remain largely unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pesticides, Big Green would curtail the use of chemicals that 
deplete the protective ozone layer. Beginning Jan. 1, 1997, businesses would be 
prohibited from producing, using or selling these substances. Extensions could 
be granted if alternatives were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
New cars would be required by Jan. 1, 1995, to use non-ozone depleting coolants 
in air conditioners, but there would be no restrictions on the use of air 
conditioners in cars, homes or offices. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the threat of ozone depletion, 90 nations have agreed to curb their 
use of the destructive chemicals. Proposition 128 would require California 
companies to discontinue using these substances years sooner than industry 
elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the deadlines would leave companies time to find 
alternatives and place California in the forefront of technological change. 
Opponents argue that the earlier phase-out for California could cost the 
aerospace industry as much as $500 million because it relies heavily on the use 
of an ozone-depleting chemical as a solvent. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drive technology too fast, it breaks," says Steven Moss, an analyst for 
San Francisco-based Spectrum Economics, which has been hired by the opponents 
to forecast the consequences of the measure. "You get technology that is not 
quite ready for prime time." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to protect California's coast, Proposition 128 also seeks to 
restrict offshore oil drilling, tax oil companies to pay for oil spill cleanups 
and force industry to reduce pollution of coastal waters. In each case, the 
initiative does not go substantially beyond current state or federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Even though new offshore drilling is banned in California, legislative analyst 
Elizabeth G. Hill estimates that a provision in the measure making the drilling 
prohibition harder to repeal could cost the state as much as $2 billion in 
deferred oil revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 also would tax oil companies $500 million to pay for future 
spill cleanups. California legislators recently approved a similar cleanup 
program that would tax the industry $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
All companies that discharge into coastal waters would have to determine what 
toxic materials they are releasing and search for safe alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It will ban every toxic chemical contaminant in our coastal waters that could 
be replaced by a cost-effective substitute chemical," said Greg Karras of 
Citizens for a Better Environment. "It's clear that an alternate economy will 
replace the toxic economy." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative also would force some coastal cities to speed up their timetable 
for providing secondary treatment of sewage before dumping it into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, opposing the measure, argues that a provision to reduce contaminated 
storm water runoffs into coastal waters could cost local governments hundreds 
of millions of dollars without substantially improving the marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
He also contends that water supplies for human consumption could be reduced 
under a provision that he says requires more water for marine life. The authors 
say he is misinterpreting the measure. 
</P>
<P>
There is less dispute over Proposition 128's provisions on redwoods. The 
measure would ban their clear-cutting and provide $300 million in bonds to buy 
some of the state's oldest redwoods and finance urban tree planting. 
</P>
<P>
A second initiative supported by environmentalists would go further. 
Proposition 130 would ban clear-cutting of all trees -- not just redwoods -- 
and reduce the amount of timber that could be harvested. It also would provide 
$742 million in bonds for the purchase of forest land and the retraining of 
loggers. 
</P>
<P>
The timber industry is offering its alternative to forest management. 
Proposition 138 would ban clear-cutting in name, but contains loopholes that 
would allow loggers to take most, if not all, trees from a given site. That 
proposal offers a $300-million bond measure to pay for more tree planting in 
urban and rural areas and for assistance to small landowners to improve timber 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from any cost to consumers and industry, legislative analyst Hill says 
the price tag of Proposition 128 includes $90 million a year for state and 
local governments and onetime costs of $300 million in bonds, $750,000 to set 
up the office of the environmental advocate, and $40 million for research to 
find substitutes for banned pesticides and ozone-depleting chemicals and to 
reduce greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
With the opposition focusing its campaign on financial costs, environmental 
groups are trying to move the spotlight to the environment itself, arguing that 
the cost of not doing anything will be far greater: a dearth of redwoods, 
climatic disruptions for future generations, fouled water and polluted air. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups and industry and government officials nationwide are 
watching the outcome of Proposition 128, which could have ramifications for 
regulations designed to attack environmental ills. 
</P>
<P>
William K. Reilly, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said 
California's experience with the initiative, if it passes, will be 
"extraordinarily instructive." 
</P>
<P>
"Big Green will have profound implications outside California."

'SHORT, SHALLOW' SLUMP SEEN BY MANY EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time of soaring oil prices, turmoil in federal budget policy and 
widespread financial jitters, it might seem that the U.S. economy is about to 
go off the cliff. In fact, the current downturn may prove surprisingly mild, 
many economists say. 
</P>
<P>
"The slump should be short and shallow," Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, predicts. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing agreement that a slump of some degree has arrived. Cautious 
consumers, troubled financial institutions and a weakening jobs picture are 
just a few of the signs. Since the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis, gauges of 
employment, industrial output, construction and retail sales all have portrayed 
an economy that is losing vitality. 
</P>
<P>
"Something always causes a recession -- they just don't happen," observed 
Norman E. Mains, chief economist with the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
investment firm in Los Angeles. "In this case, the escalation of oil prices 
pushed us over the line." 
</P>
<P>
Mains is in the crowded camp of optimists: He predicts the slump will be 
"relatively short and moderate." 
</P>
<P>
Just how moderate is the sort of imponderable that economists debate endlessly. 
Certainly, the heavy debt burden now held by much of corporate America -- owing 
to 1980s financial machinations -- poses potential trouble. And a malaise has 
emerged in public expectations for the economy, recent surveys show. Thus, some 
foresee a more serious downturn in store. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at the apparent start of what is arguably the most anticipated recession 
in history, things could be worse. Remember the "misery index" of inflation and 
unemployment widely quoted in a past day of feverish price rises? Today it 
stands at 11.22; in the 1980 recession, it soared beyond 20. 
</P>
<P>
Several factors may temper the misery of a slump this time around, according to 
those who look on the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates -- although high enough to frustrate many executives -- are not 
skyrocketing, as they have at the outset of recent downturns. The prime rate, 
on which banks base loans to favored customers, currently stands at 10%, half a 
point lower than it was in January. Early in the 1981-1982 recession, the prime 
galloped to 20.5%; in the 1980 slump, it hit 19.8%. 
</P>
<P>
To the optimists, this suggests that the coming economic adjustment will be 
less traumatic than in some past recessions. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy hasn't fallen out of bed, by any means," said Gary Schlossberg, an 
economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. But he added cautiously: "If 
we're not in a recession already, we're awfully close." 
</P>
<P>
Another plus for the economy is the seemingly mundane matter of inventories, an 
element viewed as quite important by economists. In a classic recession, 
inventories in stores and factories pile up, saddling businesses with unsold 
products and triggering a chain reaction of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, there is at least some encouraging news: Although retail 
inventories have risen, factory inventories are at their lowest level in years, 
having dropped throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you weigh all the evidence, I think the odds are still in favor of what I 
would call a fairly mild setback," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at 
Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
In serious slumps of the past, companies often have had to impose harsh layoffs 
as conditions grew worse. Optimists say cuts and layoffs may be less severe 
this time because so many firms trimmed costs in the 1980s in an effort to 
heighten competitiveness. Industrial America may also be aided by the low level 
of the dollar, which gives a price advantage to U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the auto makers and steelmakers seem fairly well prepared for this 
recession," said Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Associates, 
a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
If the optimistic view is correct, even consumer debt burdens may be more 
benign than expected. That is because, much more than in the past, consumer 
loans are linked to the rate of inflation. About 30% of all home mortgages, for 
example, now have adjustable rates, Getman calculated. The monthly payments for 
such loans would gradually decline as interest rates fell in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Is there something wrong with this picture? Isn't there a chance that the 
recession will be long and painful? The sunny scenarios could prove to be 
ill-founded, to be sure. The price of oil, the outcome of the Persian Gulf 
crisis and other variables all could influence the economy in ways that are 
impossible to predict. 
</P>
<P>
"Most economists are saying this is going to be a mild recession," declared 
Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, Washington consultants. 
"But, as they say -- in our wonderful jargon -- all the risks are on the 
downside." 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the economy are in serious trouble right now. Construction, for 
example, is in its worst shape in years. Real estate values have fallen sharply 
in the Northeast and parts of the West. Regionally, New England and the Middle 
Atlantic are in the grips of a full-blown downturn. 
</P>
<P>
A major problem is whether debt-saddled U.S. corporations can survive a 
business decline without plunging into bankruptcy and throwing their employees 
out of work. Debt has become a chronic burden for many firms. Today, about 35% 
of overall corporate cash flow goes to interest payments -- compared to just 
18% in 1985, according to the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
As conditions worsen, the debt burden will only get harder to bear. "The highly 
leveraged nature of the economy means that the negative consequences (of a 
recession) are that much greater," warned Raymond Dalio, president of 
Bridgewater Group, a money-management firm in Wilton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Another notable minus is the troubled state of the financial industry. 
Increasingly, banks and other lenders are being haunted by commercial real 
estate loans that are delinquent or in default. 
</P>
<P>
The problems are most obvious in the Northeast -- Chase Manhattan Corp. just 
announced a $623-million third-quarter loss -- but they may be spreading 
westward. This week, Security Pacific Corp., Citicorp and Great Western 
Financial reported declines in third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk is that the problems of the banking sector and real estate sector 
will start to feed on each other," Robertson of Mellon Bank warned. 
Nonetheless, he foresees "a pretty shallow, short-lived recession." 
</P>
<P>
And, although today's interest rates may look better than those of the late 
1970s, many investors complain that the Federal Reserve Board is moving too 
slowly to ease them in a faltering economy. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has 
said that he would let rates fall if Congress and the White House settle on a 
credible plan to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Getman, who maintains that the recession could be mild, said that the outlook 
will darken if interest rates don't start to decline: "If short-term rates 
don't fall quickly, you're going to have one hell of a recession," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To further complicate matters, some question whether the gains from cutting the 
deficit will be offset by damage from the higher taxes and reduced federal 
spending that would be part of a spending accord. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget accord, needed as it is, is out of step with the economic climate," 
Mains of Bateman Eichler said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all the bad news, some experts still say the economy has more life in 
it than is commonly recognized. "I'm still persuaded that the economy is going 
to skate by -- barely," said Frederick W. Thurm, an economist with Fuji 
Securities in Chicago.

HOUSE OKS HIKE IN TAXES ON RICH; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE INCREASE IS PART OF A DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE APPROVED 227 TO 
203. THE MARGIN IS TOO SMALL TO OVERRIDE A THREATENED VETO. BUSH PREFERS A 
SENATE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ignoring a presidential veto threat, the House on Tuesday approved a Democratic 
deficit reduction plan that would raise taxes primarily on the rich but affect 
every taxpayer, setting up a confrontation that could bring another government 
shutdown next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year, $500-billion proposal -- the largest deficit-cutting measure in 
history -- was approved on a roll call vote of 227 to 203, mainly along party 
lines. Ten Republicans joined 217 Democrats in voting for the proposal, and 163 
GOP lawmakers were supported by 40 Democrats in opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-vote margin reflected a victory for Democratic leaders, who lobbied hard 
for the package, but it fell far short of the two-thirds majority needed to 
override a Bush veto. 
</P>
<P>
The measure now goes to the Senate, which has drafted a bipartisan budget plan 
of its own that Bush has said he finds more acceptable. The chamber is slated 
to vote on the measure today or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the House plan is likely to be diluted in a House-Senate conference 
committee later this week, Bush warned again Tuesday that he would veto the 
measure if the House tax increase provisions remained. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying it's a 'soak-the-rich' deal, but inevitably . . . it gets in 
the pocket of every working man and woman," the President told a GOP 
fund-raising event in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do that," he told audiences on earlier political stops in 
Iowa and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House by a 238-192 vote adopted the tax provisions of the package 
after Democratic leaders refused to allow a vote on a Republican proposal that 
would have cut the deficit by $400 billion while avoiding any tax increase at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 228 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted for the tax part of the plan, 
whereas 164 Republicans and 28 Democrats opposed it. Although this margin was 
substantial, it too was considerably short of the two-thirds needed for an 
override. 
</P>
<P>
Bush canceled plans to be in Cincinnati today to attend the second game of the 
World Series. White House officials said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) had asked him to 
return to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the bill would trim the budget deficit by $40.3 billion this fiscal 
year and $459.7 billion over the following four years. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the House-passed package seeks to shift the burden of the deficit 
reduction away from the middle-class and more toward the wealthiest taxpayers. 
It also would ease cutbacks in Medicare benefits contained in the earlier 
accord and not raise gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action came 12 days after the House decisively defeated, by a vote of 
254 to 179, a bipartisan budget summit agreement that had been negotiated over 
4 1/2 months by top White House officials and Democratic and Republican 
congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
After the bipartisan plan was rejected, House Democrats drafted their own 
alternative plan. On Monday, Republicans came up with an eleventh-hour proposal 
to cut spending by $400 billion while adhering to Bush's earlier "no-new-taxes" 
pledge, which he has abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, who seized the initiative themselves in hopes of breaking the 
impasse over the budget, displayed rare unity Tuesday, with liberals and 
conservatives joining to support the election-year measure. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, clearly outnumbered, decried the bill as a revival of "class 
warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has warned that, if the lawmakers do not produce an acceptable budget 
agreement by midnight Friday, he will shut down the federal government, as he 
did over the Columbus Day weekend. House leaders insisted that they will be 
able to meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's major objection to the House measure is to a series of provisions that 
would raise taxes by about $175 billion over the next five years, primarily for 
those earning more than $50,000 a year. The increases would be especially heavy 
for upper-income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The major elements of the package would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase the top income-tax rate for the wealthiest taxpayers -- mainly 
those earning $200,000 a year or more -- to 33%, from 28% now, and raise the 
alternative minimum tax, paid largely by wealthy people with large deductions, 
to 25%, from 21% now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Impose a 10% surtax on all people whose taxable incomes amount to $1 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Impose a 10% luxury tax on cars priced above $30,000, furs costing $10,000 
or more, jewelry priced at $5,000 or more and yachts and airplanes costing more 
than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase the tax burden for all Americans by delaying for one year the 
automatic adjustment of the personal exemption and of the standard income-tax 
brackets -- a move that would raise an additional $36 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Raise the cost of Medicare insurance by increasing monthly insurance 
premiums to $46.20 by 1995 -- from $28.60 now -- and requiring Medicare 
recipients to pay the first $100 of their physicians' bills each year instead 
of $75, as is the case now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Apply the existing 1.45% health insurance payroll tax on the first $100,000 
of a person's wages, rather than the first $51,300, as now is the case. The 
measure also for the first time would require state and local employees to pay 
the Medicare tax. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In an appeal to middle-income taxpayers, allow a once-in-a-lifetime 
tax-free profit of up to $100,000 on the sale of real estate, farms, businesses 
and timbers -- but not stocks or bonds. A separate, annual gain of $1,000 also 
would be allowed for people with incomes of less than $100,000. The $100,000 
tax-free profit would be in addition to the $125,000 tax-free gain now allowed 
on the sale of a residence by those 55 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Double the federal beer tax to 32 cents per six-pack, raise taxes on wine 
from 3 cents a bottle to 25 cents a bottle and increase the tax on hard liquor 
by $1 for each proof gallon. Cigarette taxes would be raised by 8 cents a pack. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Raise the airline ticket tax to 10% from the present 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide larger tax breaks for working poor families by raising the earned 
income tax credit by $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour debate on the House measure was filled with harsh partisan 
rhetoric, along with appeals by some lawmakers for Congress to demonstrate a 
sense of national responsibility and approve the largest deficit-cutting plan 
ever considered. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Bush has warned that he will veto the proposal, Rep. Lynn Martin 
(R-Ill.) declared: "If you (Democrats) want to bring down the government with 
your game of chicken, you will bear the full responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Huckaby (D-La.), a conservative, argued on behalf of the plan put 
forward by Democrats on the House Ways and Means panel, saying: "This is a fair 
package. Let's make it happen and get on with the business of America." 
</P>
<P>
At issue was a basic difference in approach by the two parties. Republicans 
insisted in their latest budget plan that more than $400 billion could be 
sliced from the deficit by spending cuts alone, without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, however, said there is no way to reach the President's goal of 
reducing red-ink spending by $500 billion over the next five years without 
raising taxes and said their package would put the greatest new tax burdens on 
the very rich. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair," said Rep. Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.), with heavy sarcasm. "It hits 
everybody -- the rich, the middle income, the poor -- across the board. More 
taxes on everything." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), floor manager of the bill, argued 
that the Democratic alternative is a balanced package with spending and benefit 
cuts accounting for two-thirds of the deficit reduction and tax increases 
representing only 30% of the whole budget package. 
</P>
<P>
"This nation is in crisis," Panetta said, urging swift approval of the budget 
plan so that the Senate could act today in time to send a compromise version to 
the President's desk before current spending authority expires at midnight 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The divisions in the House were evident from the outset when Michel tried to 
protest a party line decision by the House Rules Committee to prevent a vote on 
a Republican alternative. The GOP appeal was rejected, 231 to 195. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee approved its own bipartisan deficit 
reduction package that hewed more closely to the rejected bipartisan deal by 
including a 9.5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and by not raising top-bracket tax 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
But the Senate plan would raise taxes on people making $100,000 or more a year 
by limiting their deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Operating with rare speed, Senate and House negotiators were expected to work 
out a compromise for ratification by both chambers in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Republican critics noted that the Democratic alternative would hit 
middle-income families hard by delaying inflation adjustments of tax brackets 
and the current $2,050 personal exemption. They charged that the delay would 
amount to a massive tax increase for the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A TALE OF TWO TAX PLANS 
</P>
<P>
 A comparison of key provisions of rival tax proposals approved by the Senate 
Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
INCOME TAX 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would increase taxes on wealthier Americans by disallowing $500 in 
deductions for every $10,000 in income above $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
House: Would increase the marginal tax rate to 33% from 28% for top-bracket 
taxpayers, add a 10% surtax on incomes above $1 million and boost the 
alternative minimum tax paid by those who claim large deductions. Would delay 
inflation adjustments for tax brackets and personal exemptions for one year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
<P>
Senate: No change. 
</P>
<P>
House: Would reduce maximum tax on capital gains to 28% from 33%. Would allow a 
one-time, lifetime exclusion of up to $100,000 on gains from real estate and 
some other assets, but not stocks. Would allow an exclusion of up to $1,000 a 
year for gains from stocks and most other assets except collectibles. The 
annual exclusion would be reduced for high-income taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEDICARE 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would increase the ceiling on wages subject to the 1.45% Medicare tax 
to $89,000 from current $51,300. Would boost the premium for Part B doctor bill 
coverage to $29.90 a month in 1991 and to $46.20 in 1995 from current $28.60. 
Would increase Part B deductible to $150 a year from $75 and require 
beneficiaries to pay 20% of cost of lab tests. 
</P>
<P>
House: Would raise wage ceiling subject to Medicare tax to $100,000. Would 
increase Part B premium by same amount as Senate proposal. Would boost annual 
deductible to $100. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE TAX 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would increase the tax by 4 cents a gallon on Dec. 1, by another 5 
cents on July 1, 1991, and by another 1/2 cent on Jan. 1, 1992. The current tax 
is 9 cents. 
</P>
<P>
House: No change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOBACCO TAX 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would increase the tax by 4 cents a pack on Jan. 1, 1991, and by 
another 4 cents in 1993. The current tax is 16 cents. 
</P>
<P>
House: Same as Senate proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALCOHOL TAX 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would boost beer tax by 16 cents a six-pack, the wine tax by 18 cents a 
bottle and the liquor tax by $1.20 a proof gallon. 
</P>
<P>
House: Would increase beer tax by 16 cents, wine tax by 22 cents and liquor tax 
by $1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LUXURY TAX 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would impose 10% tax on the cost above $30,000 for cars, $100,000 for 
boats, $5,000 for jewelry and furs and $250,000 for planes other than business 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
House: Same as Senate for cars, boats and jewelry. Would impose 10% tax on cost 
above $10,000 for furs and $100,000 for planes. Cars, boats and planes used to 
carry fare-paying passengers would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOW-INCOME CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Senate: Would increase earned income tax credit for working poor by $5 billion 
over five years. Would provide another $11.8 billion over five years in 
child-care aid. 
</P>
<P>
House: Would increase earned income credit by $11 billion over five years.

GORBACHEV RETREATS ON RADICAL ECONOMIC PLAN; 
</P>
<P>

ACCUSES HIM OF RENEGING.

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday retreated sharply from a radical 
program to transform the Soviet Union's state-owned, centrally planned economy 
into a new system based on market forces and private entrepreneurship. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, apparently fearing social unrest from resulting inflation and 
unemployment, instead proposed a carefully graduated transition that would 
slowly ease central controls over the economy, retain many government subsidies 
for inefficient firms and privatize much smaller segments of industry and 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev maintains his commitment to the eventual development of a 
market economy, he would delay its achievement by a number of years and keep it 
within the framework of what he calls the Soviet people's "socialist choice." 
</P>
<P>
Put to Soviet lawmakers Tuesday as the consolidation of seven earlier reform 
programs, Gorbachev's proposal brought immediate protests from those who had 
favored the far more radical "500-Day Plan," with its forced march to the free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, the largest Soviet 
republic, accused Gorbachev of reneging on a commitment to the radical plan, 
and the Gorbachev proposal appeared to have rekindled the potentially explosive 
dispute between the country's two most powerful politicians over the course of 
its reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, his voice thundering with anger, called upon the Russian legislature 
to consider "breaking out" of the program, even to the point of dividing the 
country's armed forces. This would amount to an economic declaration of 
independence if Gorbachev did not back down and accept a coalition in the 
central government. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposal is little more than "another attempt to preserve the 
administrative system so odious to the people," Yeltsin said, calling it an 
effort to "sabotage" the Russian Federation's own 500-Day Plan, which is to 
start Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Realization of this new program would lead to a catastrophe," Yeltsin said, 
predicting that, if attempted, the effort would collapse within six months as 
unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, however, clearly feared that plunging the disintegrating Soviet 
economy into the melee of the market would tear it to shreds -- and with it the 
social fabric of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The market, while providing for high economic efficiency, still needs state 
and political regulation -- first of all, to prevent such negative developments 
as inflation, unemployment, excessive differences in (income), instability of 
production and erratic patterns of development in different regions," he said 
at the outset of his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev had declared last month that he favored the 500-Day Plan 
drafted by Stanislav S. Shatalin, a member of his Presidential Council, and 
other radical economists, he retained only elements of it in the program he 
submitted to the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature. 
</P>
<P>
While declaring that "the historical decision to adopt the market system has 
been made," Gorbachev accepted the argument of Prime Minister Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov that the transition has to be planned and managed -- by the same 
bureaucracy that brought the economy to the point where the Soviet Union cannot 
feed, clothe or house its 290 million people. 
</P>
<P>
And as Shatalin's goals for 500 days -- a time frame that he believed long 
enough to achieve real change but short enough to give people the hope needed 
to withstand the accompanying pain -- Gorbachev extends them far, almost 
indefinitely, into the future. 
</P>
<P>
What frightened Gorbachev, it is clear from the preamble to the reform plan, 
its scaled-down goals and its stretched-out timetable, was the prospect of 
sharp increases in consumer prices, widespread unemployment, the bankruptcy of 
tens of thousands of unprofitable state-owned enterprises and farms and the 
sheer uncertainty of what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
Radical economists have argued persuasively to Gorbachev in recent months about 
the necessity of moving swiftly into a market economy to get through the 
painful part and restore popular confidence in the reforms. But conservatives 
in the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee strongly opposed such 
an approach at the committee's meeting in Moscow last week. 
</P>
<P>
Working late into the night over the past week at his suburban dacha west of 
Moscow, Gorbachev has consequently fashioned a program that appears to be a 
compromise, taking Shatalin's general scheme but Ryzhkov's specifics. 
</P>
<P>
The reality, radicals claimed Tuesday, was an almost total victory for Ryzhkov 
and the apparat, whose language of "administer," "assign," "control," 
"instruct," "regulate," "allocate" and "lead" permeates a document meant to 
develop a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We can easily see the desire to concentrate economic power at the center -- 
nothing has changed," said Ruslan Khasbulatov, Yeltsin's deputy. "But this 
concentration is in the hands of a weak and inefficient government, and it will 
not bring positive results." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev will argue his case Friday before the Supreme Soviet, but that body 
has already given him the power to rule by decree for 18 months, rendering 
almost irrelevant its approval of the program. The lawmakers are scheduled to 
debate the program through the weekend before voting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The acuteness of the crisis makes it essential to act without delay," 
Gorbachev said in the 66-page program. "The situation in the economy is 
continuing to deteriorate. The volume of production is declining, and economic 
links are being broken. 
</P>
<P>
"The life of ordinary people is becoming more and more difficult, and their 
interest in working is failing, while their faith in the future is being 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in an extremely dangerous zone -- the old administrative system 
of management has been destroyed, but new stimuli to work in market conditions 
have not yet been created. Energetic measures, based on public consent, are 
needed to stabilize the situation and move ahead quickly on the road to a 
market economy." 
</P>
<P>
However, radicals like Khasbulatov said they fear that so much time has been 
lost and the economy has disintegrated to such an extent that any attempt to 
plan the country's economic transformation is in vain. The process of economic 
collapse is both accelerating and accumulating, they feel, and with Gorbachev's 
program becomes inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"Shatalin offered us a last chance to break out, and now Gorbachev is locking 
us in," a Yeltsin backer in the Supreme Soviet said as he read the Gorbachev 
proposal. "Shatalin said, 'Do this, and you'll be free in 500 days.' Gorbachev 
says, 'Do this for a few years, and then we'll see where we stand.' He wants to 
make us a prisoner of his fears and his weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
Where Shatalin urged that state controls be removed quickly so that the market 
forces of supply and demand would provide the energy of economic growth, 
Gorbachev said: "From the very beginning, the strengthening of the financial 
system must be stressed with the preservation of the established patterns of 
economic ties and the flow of raw materials and components within the economy. 
. . . The transition to market prices will occur in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev sees this transitional period lasting as long as two years, not the 
100 days Shatalin wanted, and he plans to use his powers to rule by decree to 
shape the reform, step by step. "Only after this, the development of the 
full-blooded market will start," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Where Shatalin envisioned the privatization of state-owned enterprises as 
propelling the economy forward, Gorbachev almost never uses the word. 
</P>
<P>
Where Shatalin frees prices to find their own levels, Gorbachev invokes a 
little-observed 1988 government decree setting wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
Where Shatalin cuts the budget deficit to almost zero, Gorbachev maintains the 
subsidies on consumer prices and for inefficient companies that this year could 
take it as high as $300 billion at official exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
Where Shatalin pushes the ruble, the Soviet currency, first into devaluation 
and then its use as a convertible currency -- freely exchangeable in the West 
for dollars or German marks -- Gorbachev postpones this crucial move. 
</P>
<P>
And where Shatalin pushes the country, ready or not, into price reform early in 
his plan, Gorbachev remains unclear when and how this will occur across the 
board. By 1992, only the prices of bread, meat, dairy products and a few other 
staples would remain fixed by the state, according to the plan, but many 
exceptions are already noted.

LOGGERS STRIPPING FORESTS, GROUP SAYS

California's largest timber companies are "strip mining" the state's forests 
while regulators stand by and watch, the environmental group Clean Water Action 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the state Department of Forestry and reports from the East 
Bay Municipal Utility District and other utilities, the environmentalists said 
stepped-up logging is fouling water supplies and threatening to force water 
agencies to install costly filtering systems to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Increased production also is hastening a fundamental change in the industry 
itself -- from using large, old trees to produce high-quality solid-wood lumber 
to using small, young trees to make particle board and other processed-wood 
products, according to the environmental group's report. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released three weeks before voters will decide the fate of three 
timber-related ballot measures, was discounted as political hyperbole by 
industry spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the shift to particle-board production) is a natural progression from an 
old-growth-based economy to a young-growth-based economy," said Shepard S. 
Tucker, a spokesman for Louisiana-Pacific Corp. in Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
But Patricia Schifferle, author of the Clean Water Action study, said that 
young-growth forests and the highly automated methods used to harvest them are 
inconsistent with laws stating that California's forests be used only to yield 
high-quality forest products. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the California Department of Forestry, at the current rate of 
harvest, in 10 years, the industry will virtually run out of all mature trees," 
Schifferle said in her report. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators appointed to oversee logging often are loggers themselves, 
working as consultants or subcontractors for the companies they are asked to 
regulate, Schifferle said.

VICTIMS-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS BACK LUNGREN

Stressing his tough anti-crime posture, Republican state attorney general 
candidate Dan Lungren on Tuesday showcased several crime victims' advocates who 
praised him while questioning the crime-fighting credentials of his Democratic 
opponent, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren "is a man of character and . . . commitment," said Collene Campbell, 
the sister of slain motor sports promoter Mickey Thompson and a leader of the 
Crime Victims California Justice Committee. "I'm so proud to know Dan, and we 
as crime victims have very little to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, speaking at a news conference, said she served "in the trenches" with 
Lungren, a former five-term congressman, to help win passage of Proposition 
115, the sweeping anti-crime initiative approved by voters in June. In 
contrast, she said, Smith, who also supported Proposition 115, never made 
himself available to meet with her. 
</P>
<P>
A Smith spokeswoman said Tuesday that the San Francisco prosecutor would be 
happy to confer with Campbell, who now heads a 400-member group called Memory 
of Victims Everywhere. "If she appeared at his office at a time when he was 
busy with district attorney's work, it's possible he couldn't meet with her at 
that time," spokeswoman Betsy Hely said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Smith has relentlessly attacked Lungren for his staunch 
anti-abortion stance as well as his repeated votes in Congress against 
anti-pollution legislation. Lungren has counterattacked by stressing the key 
role he played in the passage of criminal reform laws, including the 
Comprehensive Crime Cotrol Act of 1984, which strengthened prison sentences and 
allowed authorities to seize the assets of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's news conference, Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
Cloninger, a co-author of Proposition 115, questioned the extent of Smith's 
involvement in bringing the anti-crime initiative to the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
During a joint appearance with Lungren last month, Smith said he had helped 
draft Proposition 115, which is designed to speed trial proceedings and expand 
the number of crimes covered by the death penalty. But Cloninger said Tuesday 
he had no recollection of Smith participating in the drafting process. 
</P>
<P>
But Alameda County Dist. Atty. John J. Meehan, in a statement by Smith's 
campaign later Tuesday, said he recalled that Smith helped work on revisions of 
the proposed initiative in a California District Attorney's Assn. committee.

Three companies have agreed to provide consumer warnings on mothballs, room 
fresheners and diaper pail deodorizers that contain a chemical known to cause 
cancer, the office of Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The products, which are found in an estimated 70% of homes in California, 
contain the chemical paradichlorobenzene, which has been identified by the 
state as a carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
The action against the three companies was filed under Proposition 65, the 
state's anti-toxics law that requires businesses to provide a warning when 
exposing members of the public to a "significant risk" of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The companies named in the action, Willert Home Products, Excell Products and 
Sanitoy Inc., agreed to provide warnings on products that contain 
paradichlorobenzene. They also agreed under the settlement to place newspaper 
ads offering a refund to anyone who purchased the products without a proper 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general identified these products as containing the cancer-causing 
chemical: 
</P>
<P>
Mothballs, mothball cakes and room deodorizers made by Willert Home Products 
and sold under the names Enoz and Reefer-Galler. 
</P>
<P>
Similar products made by Excell Products and sold under the brand name Excell. 
</P>
<P>
Diaper pail liners made by Sanitoy and sold under the name Nursery Needs. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Weil, a deputy attorney general who handled the case, said studies have 
shown that a toilet bowl deodorizer containing paradichlorobenzene can expose 
people to 300 times the amount of the chemical considered safe under 
Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
All three companies could have been liable for fines of up to $2,500 a day for 
each illegal exposure. Under the terms of the agreement, Excell Products will 
pay $27,000 but the other companies were not assessed any penalty.

WILSON IN SENATE; FEINSTEIN STILL ATTACKS; 
</P>
<P>
ADS: THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE PRESSES ISSUE OF HER OPPONENT'S ATTENDANCE RECORD

Even though Sen. Pete Wilson returned to Washington for critical votes on the 
federal budget, Dianne Feinstein continued to pursue him with the Senate 
absenteeism issue by adding a new tag line to three gubernatorial campaign ads: 
"Dianne Feinstein: She'll be there for California." 
</P>
<P>
The three 30-second commercials which began running Tuesday are revised 
versions of ads that Feinstein ran during her spring primary campaign against 
fellow Democrat John K. Van de Kamp. They include the "grabber" ad that 
campaign experts said propelled her into contention in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial opens with news footage from Nov. 27, 1978, of Feinstein 
announcing the shooting deaths of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and 
Supervisor Harvey Milk. As chair of the Board of Supervisors, Feinstein became 
mayor upon Moscone's death. That came only hours after she had announced plans 
not to run again for city office. 
</P>
<P>
The second ad is another version of the same commercial, opening with the 
announcer's line, "Forged from tragedy, her leadership brought San Francisco 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The third, running on today's anniversary of the Oct. 17 earthquake, touts 
Feinstein's "foresight and common sense" in backing the reinforcement San 
Francisco's Candlestick Park to protect it from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The primary election messages have been removed. In the new versions, Feinstein 
emphasizes her positions on growth management, early childhood education and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein campaign director Bill Carrick said Tuesday the timing of the three 
ads was not linked to Republican Wilson's decision Monday to return to 
Washington for this week's Senate sessions on the budget deficit and other 
issues. Wilson had campaigned steadily in California since Labor Day but was 
heavily criticized by Feinstein for missing votes in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick also raised the possibility that a new commercial focusing on Wilson's 
voting record in the Senate would run soon. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials aired Tuesday in all major markets of the state are aimed at 
undecided voters who are just beginning to focus on the governor's race, 
Carrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're returning to basics. This is a refresher course on who Dianne is," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick has believed that about 40% of the likely voters are confirmed Wilson 
supporters, about 40% are Feinstein backers and the remaining 20% are "still up 
for grabs." He said the undecided group consists largely of blue-collar 
workers, older women and suburban voters. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign director, charged that portions of the commercials 
are misleading, including a newspaper headline that says "Feinstein Backs 
Police" and a statement that she is the only candidate with a plan for early 
childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
Bos said that the headline ran above a story reporting disarray within the San 
Francisco Police Department and that Feinstein was supporting the police 
chief's plan for stricter supervision of line officers. 
</P>
<P>
As to the early childhood education plan, Bos said, "Wilson was in favor of 
that before she was, in December." But Carrick said Feinstein is the only 
candidate with a specific proposal for paying for the expanded education 
program. She has proposed doing this by increasing the share of lottery 
proceeds going to education along with additional money from Proposition 133, a 
Nov. 6 ballot initiative that would increase the state sales tax by a half-cent 
for anti-drug education and other drug-fighting programs.

JAMES FLANIGAN: INSURANCE WON'T SUFFER S&amp;L-LIKE COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big questions are being asked about insurance -- whether the companies that 
insure your life or your business can stand up to an economic hurricane 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The life insurance industry, one of the mightiest oaks in the U.S. financial 
landscape -- with $9 trillion in face value of policies and more than $1 
trillion invested in securities, real estate and commercial mortgages -- is 
being questioned on its ability to meet policyholder claims if real estate and 
junk bond values continue to slide. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the property-casualty side of the industry -- $200 billion a year in 
premiums to cover trillions worth of automobiles, homes and businesses -- was 
challenged by Public Citizen, the Ralph Nader group in Washington, on whether 
it could withstand a severe recession. 
</P>
<P>
Some alarmists, linking insurance with the savings and loans, say the industry 
threatens taxpayers and policyholders with big losses. 
</P>
<P>
But such views are extreme. Policyholders won't lose -- although they could be 
discomforted -- and taxpayers shouldn't lose either. The likelihood is that 
insurance will work out of its problems in the years ahead, although its 
troubles will mean less money available for investment in industry and real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other financial chuckholes left over from the 1980s, insurance's 
troubles will make life a little poorer for Americans in the '90s. So you 
should know what all the shouting is about. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the present concern can be discounted as political gamesmanship -- such 
as the Nader group's call for Congress to change laws governing 
property-casualty insurers. "Concern about solvency on that side of insurance 
is misplaced," says Herbert E. Goodfriend, insurance analyst with 
Prudential-Bache Securities. Property companies are better-heeled than ever, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But more genuine questions are being asked about life insurance. IDS Financial 
Services, through its own insurance division, issued a study recently 
suggesting that 20% of the largest insurance companies would run into serious 
trouble if changes were not made. 
</P>
<P>
David Shulman, real estate expert at the Salomon Bros. investment firm, 
predicted in June that insurance companies would run into defaults on 
commercial mortgages in 1991. Today, he says, "the recession has brought 
forward the day of reckoning." 
</P>
<P>
Prudential's Goodfriend notes the recent $650-million increase in loss reserves 
by Travelers Insurance and predicts that half a dozen large insurers will have 
to set aside similar, if smaller, reserves against investment losses. 
</P>
<P>
The problems reflect not only the slumping economy, but changes in life 
insurance as it went from a dull, reliable business that sold you a policy and 
paid off when you died, to a performance-oriented high-flyer. Where the 
industry once invested most conservatively in bonds and properties, in the last 
decade it reached for higher yields in junk bonds and more speculative real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
The higher yields allowed insurers to compete for investor dollars by offering 
annuities and other investment policies -- all with a tax-deferred buildup of 
income. 
</P>
<P>
The industry also reached for pension business, offering to guarantee 
retirement payouts to employees with investment contracts. Today, many big 
companies face losses on those high-interest guarantees -- notably Equitable 
Life, which could lose as much as $1 billion. To put that in perspective, the 
firm has $62 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial real estate is a growing problem -- office vacancy rates are up in 
many parts of the country. That means rental income and thus insurance company 
cash flows will be down. 
</P>
<P>
What if a company gets in trouble? There is an industry guarantee system in 
which all companies chip in to rescue the policyholders of the ailing member. 
Policyholders won't lose, although as creditors they may have to wait for their 
money. And, note well, the industry's guarantee system isn't backed by 
regulation in some states, prominently New Jersey and California. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the industry's strength should be kept in mind. The great 
mass of life insurance investments are in high-grade securities and sound real 
estate. That's why fears of catastrophe are overdone. The industry needs to 
rebuild the financial equivalent of porch rails and fences, not the whole 
house. 
</P>
<P>
So insurance companies will pull in their horns in the '90s, building up 
capital and reserves, and limiting investment -- another sore muscle for the 
U.S. economy but not a mortal injury. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's troubles offer yet another reflection on the 1980s. It is being 
called the decade of greed, but it was something else -- a time of 
institutional mania. Some of the biggest -- and supposedly smartest -- 
companies are troubled. They took simple ideas to extremes -- that 
high-yielding bonds might not be riskier than high-quality ones, that all real 
estate is a sound investment. 
</P>
<P>
It was really a decade of blind optimism. But as we recover now, we shouldn't 
fall victim to blind pessimism. The '80s weren't as good as people thought they 
were, and the '90s won't be as bad as they fear.

Leona Helmsley's Appeal Argued: The hotel queen's lawyer appealed her 
income-tax evasion conviction in New York, arguing that prosecutors used her 
testimony before a state grand jury to convict her in federal court. Members of 
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to be receptive at least in part 
to arguments of her attorney, Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, 70, was convicted in U.S. District Court a year ago of 33 criminal 
charges when a jury found her guilty of evading $1.2 million in taxes between 
1983 and 1985. She was sentenced to 4 years in prison and a $7.1-million fine. 
Helmsley is free on bail. Dershowitz also argued the case brought against 
Helmsley was tainted because it was based on her testimony before a state grand 
jury. He said information from the secret state panel was used to bring the 
federal indictment. Dershowitz called the tie between her state testimony and 
the federal indictment a "direct chain of causation."

Withdrawals From S&amp;Ls Slow In May: The Office of Thrift Supervision 
reported that net withdrawals from the nation's savings and loans slowed to $7 
billion in May after soaring to a record $15.1 billion a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Depositors withdrew $3.2 billion from 2,471 solvent S&amp;Ls and another $3.8 
billion from the 312 failed institutions operated under government control. 
That compares to a net outflow in April of $9.6 billion at solvent institutions 
and $5.4 billion at government-run thrifts. The agency is about three months 
behind in its reporting of financial data.

PEOPLE: BIG SHAKE-UP AT SUMITOMO OVER SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman and the vice president of Japan's Sumitomo Bank, the world's 
third-largest bank, have resigned to take responsibility for a former branch 
manager's alleged link to a stock speculation scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Ichio Isoda announced Oct. 7 that he would resign following the arrest 
of a former branch manager on suspicion of offering illegal loans to a stock 
speculator. 
</P>
<P>
But there had been no prior announcement that Vice President Teizaburo Nishi 
would resign. No replacements have yet been named. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman Ko Komatsu also resigned for health reasons, a Sumitomo spokesman 
said. Komatsu and Isoda will assume advisory positions on the board. 
</P>
<P>
All 50 board members will take substantial cuts in their special allowances for 
the six months starting in November, the spokesman said.

HEARING DATE SET ON KEATING BAIL APPEAL; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE ARIZONA BUSINESSMAN IS BEING HELD ON SECURITIES FRAUD CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Los Angeles County authorities to explain at 
a hearing why there should be a $5-million bail set on businessman Charles H. 
Keating Jr., who has been jailed since he was indicted a month ago on state 
securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, U.S. District Court Judge John G. Davies set the hearing for 
1:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Davies' decision came after the Los Angeles County District Attorney's 
Office filed a response Tuesday to Keating's petition to reduce or lift the 
high bail. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had gone through the state appellate system seeking a review of the 
bail set by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge. A state Court of Appeal 
panel refused to lower bail and the state Supreme Court refused to hear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, 66, is the former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, 
which owned Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. The company filed for 
bankruptcy in April, 1989, and regulators seized Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold nearly $200 million in debt securities through Lincoln's 29 
Southern California branches, and the small investors who bought the bonds say 
they were misled into believing that the bonds were safe and insured. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-count indictment accuses Keating and three others of providing investors 
with false and misleading information and violating other state laws in selling 
the bonds. The bonds have become worthless since the collapse of the company 
and the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
A trial is tentatively set for Nov. 26. But both the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court trial judge and defense attorneys said they doubted a trial 
could begin that soon.

A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoa in Japan: Alcoa has entered into a joint venture with Kobe Steel of Japan 
to produce aluminum for beverage cans and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
An industry analyst says it is one of the most important moves Alcoa has made. 
The Japanese market is ripe for growth because only 35% of its soda cans are 
aluminum, compared to 95% in the United States. Kobe, Japan's leading producer 
of flat-rolled aluminum, needs aluminum ingots, which an Alcoa subsidiary in 
Australia can provide. The venture, KSL Alcoa Aluminum Co., will also work on 
Japanese auto makers' target of reducing the weight of some cars by 40%.

Cards Foretell Slow Sales: Such major retailers as J. C. Penney and the Limited 
have observed two disturbing trends. First, it is becoming increasingly 
difficult to market new credit cards. In the past few years, the chains have 
lost credit customers to Visa and MasterCard. The decline has steepened since 
the Middle East crisis. Equally troubling is that consumers are accelerating 
payment of credit card purchases. The inference is that consumers are reducing 
personal debt in anticipation of layoffs. Because shoppers typically spend 
twice as much when they pay with plastic, retailers are worried as the holiday 
season approaches. Atlanta Constitution 
</P>
<P>
Business Layover: With air fares up 5% to 10% since Iraq invaded Kuwait, 
businesses are implementing more frugal travel policies, asking in some cases 
that employees stay over on a Saturday during a business trip to take advantage 
of discounted fares. More commonly, firms are reducing the number of 
representatives they send to conventions and canceling companywide meetings.

The British conglomerate Hanson PLC said Tuesday it had agreed to swap its 49% 
stake in Newmont Mining Corp. for control of a major U.S. timber company. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said it agreed to buy General Oriental Securities Ltd. and Hornwood 
Barbados Ltd. of the United States for $1.3 billion in cash and notes. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two companies own 99.5% of Cavenham Forest Industries. Darien, 
Conn.-based Cavenham owns or controls about 1.7 million acres of U.S. 
timberland in the West and South. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said it would sell its 49% stake in Newmont Mining Corp. of the United 
States to the owners of General Oriental and Hornwood for $1.1 billion in cash 
and $189 million in notes. The remaining 51% stake in Newmont is publicly held. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Hanson paid $1.2 billion for full control of Peabody Holding Co., the 
United States' biggest coal producer.

DOW PLUNGES 35 ON BUDGET, OIL WORRIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street's two main headaches -- rising oil prices and federal budget 
bickering -- struck again Tuesday and sent stocks sharply lower. Another batch 
of bad earnings also hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 35.15, nearly 1.5%, at 2,381.19 
points, eating up much of the 51-point advance it made in the past two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 9 to 4 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 487 up, 1,077 
down and 424 unchanged. Big Board volume retreated to 149.57 million shares 
from 164.98 million on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Oil jumped almost $1 a barrel Tuesday, and the budget process in Washington 
still appeared stalled. The two crises have combined for most of the month to 
make investors uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointing third-quarter corporate earnings, a falling dollar and 
computer-trading programs were also cited as culprits in Tuesday's losses. And 
most disconcerting to many traders was another round of weakness in key 
financial stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very disorderly market right now," said Robert Morris, vice president 
in equity research for Chase Manhattan Bank. Analysts see little relief, 
especially if economic figures continue to point to recession, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Shares of Student Loan Marketing tumbled 6 5/8 to 36 1/2. After the close, 
the loan financier denied a newspaper report of wrongdoing at its loan 
servicing center in Kansas. It also denied reports that is was under 
investigation by the FBI, saying the agency had not contacted Sallie Mae in 
this regard. Sister agency Federal Home Loan Mortgage slumped 3 1/4 to 38 3/4, 
and Federal National Mortgage lost 1 3/4 to 27, as investors worried about 
credit or fraud problems spreading. 
</P>
<P>
* The S&amp;L sector also took a huge hit once again on loan worries. Golden 
West Financial plunged 4 3/8 to 19 3/8 after reporting virtually flat 
third-quarter earnings of 68 cents a share. Great Western Financial lost 1 1/2 
to 9 1/8 and H.F. Ahmanson dropped 1 3/8 to 11 1/2, in anticipation of their 
earnings reports, which came after the market close. 
</P>
<P>
* Key bank stocks dropped anew after Citicorp reported earnings off 43%. That 
stock fell 1 1/8 to 13. Wells Fargo dropped 1 1/2 to 43 1/8 on its earnings 
report, and First Interstate fell 3/8 to 18 1/2 on its report. Most banks 
showed increased problems from defaulted loans. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana's Hibernia Bank dropped 1 3/8 to 7 3/4 after it became the latest big 
bank to slash its dividend because of rising loan problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Investors slammed General Electric stock down 2 7/8 to 51 1/2 after the firm 
reported a 9% increase in third-quarter earnings. Elsewhere, TRW dropped 2 to 
33 1/4 on lower earnings, and American Cyanamid lost 2 to 43 5/8 after 
reporting a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Many other industrial stocks also sank on recession fears, including Deere, off 
1 5/8 to 38 3/8, Ingersoll Rand, off 1 3/8 to 30, and Monsanto, off 1 to 39 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Lotus Development rose 1 5/8 to 14 3/8. The software company reported lower 
third-quarter earnings but said it would buy back 5 million of its shares. 
Elsewhere, Apple Computer fell 2 3/4 to 25 on worries about the company's 
first-quarter earnings, which are expected within a week. 
</P>
<P>
* Among Southland issues, retailer Pic 'N' Save plunged 1 3/8 to 5 7/8. Optical 
Radiation continued its recent slide, down another 1 3/8 to 20 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* McGraw Hill gained 1 3/8 to 42 1/2. The company said it expects earnings for 
the year to be at the low end of its forecast range of $3.50 to $4 per share. 
It reported a slight increase in third-quarter profit, to $1.38 a share. 
</P>
<P>
* Defense stocks were broadly lower, led by General Dynamics, off 1 3/8 to 21, 
and McDonnell Douglas, down 1 1/4 to 48 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices fell, dragging the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 
index back below the 2,100 level. The index closed down 18.3 points, at 
2,083.6. 
</P>
<P>
German shares closed a quiet trading session 1.2% below Monday's closing levels 
as small numbers of selling orders weighed prices down in a thin market. The 
30-share DAX index fell 18.17 points to 1,460.72. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices finished well up but slipped from the day's highs after 
profit taking skimmed the top off gains made on the back of a stronger yen and 
an easier oil prices. The Nikkei 225-share average climbed 496.90 points to 
23,606.10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Higher Despite Oil Surge 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices closed higher, boosted by hopes that tension in the 
Middle East may be easing, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield slipped to 8.89% from 8.93% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market seemed to brush off the rise in oil prices, which has been a 
chief concern of bond investors since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Bond 
prices normally fall on signs of increasing inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 7.938%, down from 8% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar at All-Time Low Against Mark 
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit an all-time low against the German mark as budget deadlock and 
fears of recession battered investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar is under heavy pressure both from the nation's budget problems and 
because of concerns about the economic slowdown, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar tumbled to an all-time low of 1.506 German marks before 
closing at 1.511, against 1.5262 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended at 126.79 Japanese yen, down from 127.73 Monday after sinking 
to 126.50, the lowest since February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound closed at $1.965, up from $1.949 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Crude Oil Futures Close at $38.89 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum futures rallied late in the session on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange after the United States and Kuwait's exiled government discounted 
speculation that Iraq might withdraw from Kuwait if it is allowed to retain 
three key areas -- two islands controlling Iraq's access to the gulf and part 
of an oil field. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans retreated, and livestock and 
meat futures fell. 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude oil futures settled 85 to 94 cents higher, with November at 
$38.89 a barrel.

ROCKWELL TO SELL PART OF EL SEGUNDO FACILITY 
</P>

<P>
Rockwell International said Tuesday that it will sell 50 acres of its 100-acre 
aircraft manufacturing complex in El Segundo and transfer some of the machinery 
there to sites in Palmdale and Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement confirms what the company said in September, 1988, when it 
said it would close down most manufacturing activities at the site after the 
last B-1 bomber was produced. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said 16 of 600 machines in El Segundo will be sent to Tulsa, where 
Rockwell produces aircraft components. But the firm said it will continue to 
locate any future aircraft assembly operations at its facilities in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the plan to sell the facilities will affect 300 workers. Of 
those, 20 will be transferred to Tulsa, an undetermined number will be 
transferred to other Rockwell plants in Southern California, and the balance 
will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials said they did not have a list of which facilities in the 
complex will be sold, but they plan to retain an engineering building and 
wind-tunnel facilities. Even after the sale, the company said it would retain 
3,250 workers in El Segundo, including 2,000 engineers. In addition, some 
production workers will remain in El Segundo for advanced manufacturing work, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company declined to say how much the property is worth, but real estate 
experts have estimated that the 50-acre site is worth $70 million, not 
including the value of the buildings on the site or the cost to demolish them. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo complex has 2.7 million square feet of plant space, Tulsa 1.65 
million and Palmdale 900,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell sold a major portion of the El Segundo complex to Northrop in 1978, 
which uses its site to produce rear fuselage sections for the F-18 jet fighter. 
That facility includes 1.9 million square feet of plant space on 75 acres.

Financial News Network, which last week fired its chief financial officer for 
allegedly receiving unauthorized payments, on Tuesday laid off its entire Los 
Angeles financial and accounting staff, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, said to number at least 15 employees, were reportedly ordered to 
consolidate FNN's finance department under executives based in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
FNN officials could not be reached for comment. Last week, FNN dismissed its 
accounting firm, Deloitte &amp; Touche, after a disagreement over how to treat 
start-up costs for a new business venture launched last July. FNN then hired 
the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation was also said to accommodate Cooper &amp; Lybrand's wish to 
have FNN's finance department located near the accounting firm's Washington 
offices, so that it could work more closely with FNN and Infotechnology Inc. 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
Infotechnology owns 47% of FNN and 97% of United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
FNN said last week that it fired its chief financial officer, C. Steven Bolen, 
after it discovered that he had received unauthorized payments from an 
unidentified source. In addition, FNN alleged that Bolen improperly handled 
certain bank accounts. Bolen could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
FNN's finances are now being managed by Gary A. Prince, senior vice president 
of financial operations at FNN and a former senior executive at Infotechnology 
and UPI. 
</P>
<P>
One executive at the company said the plan to lay off the accounting staff and 
move the department to the East was set some time ago, and the current troubles 
simply accelerated the timetable.

NWA'S CHECCHI MAKES A BID FOR EASTERN; 
</P>
<P>
MERGERS: THE LOS ANGELES INVESTOR SAID HE IS ALSO EYEING OTHER CARRIERS,

Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred A. Checchi said Tuesday that he made an 
offer for Eastern Airlines and is taking a look at other air carriers, 
including Pan American, World Airways and Trans World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said he submitted a bid for Eastern to the airline's bankruptcy trustee 
last week. He declined to discuss the offer in detail and said he had no idea 
when he might learn whether it would be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be Monday, or it could be 30 days from now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An airline acquisition would be the second in 16 months for Checchi, a Los 
Angeles investor who emerged from relative obscurity to buy Northwest's parent, 
NWA Inc., in June, 1989. He and two partners put up $40 million of a total $700 
million in equity and borrowed $3 billion from banks to close that purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said he is considering a deal now because current high fuel prices are 
wiping out airline profits and might force troubled airlines to seek a merger 
partner to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an opportunity to seek a company, or a piece of a company, that will 
allow us to be more competitive," he said. "We are in a pretty good position to 
be advantaged by the present environment." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern is in bankruptcy proceedings, but it isn't clear that it will be sold. 
Pan Am and TWA, money-losing carriers that are traditionally strong in the 
trans-Atlantic market, are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi made his comments in an interview at NWA headquarters in Eagan, a 
suburb of St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
The air carriers' current problems have not passed Northwest by. Checchi said 
Northwest expects to lose "its share" of the $1-billion deficit that the 
industry expects to record in the fourth quarter, largely because of a rapid 
jump in fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for increased costs, Northwest and other airlines are cutting 
back on expenses and planning layoffs. Checchi said Tuesday that Northwest has 
reduced costs by $200 million and plans to begin selective layoffs next week. 
To the extent possible, he said, temporary employment cutbacks will be 
accomplished through voluntary leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Checchi said that the number of employees involved in any layoff would be 
small, at least initially. "I find it personally repugnant to put people on the 
street and would fight and struggle mightily to avoid that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest employs around 44,000. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest is also taking steps to increase its revenue. On Tuesday, it 
announced a 5.8% fuel-related fare hike, its third since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion 
of Kuwait. Checchi said he expects the rest of the industry to raise prices 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the squeeze on its profits, Checchi said, Northwest is in good 
financial shape and has the wherewithal to make an acquisition. He said 
Northwest has reduced its acquisition debt to $1.7 billion and is two years 
ahead of schedule on its payments. 
</P>
<P>
Given the troubled state of the airline industry, however, Checchi might find 
it hard to finance an acquisition. Banks are under regulatory pressure to avoid 
risky loans.

RED TAPE TIES UP STATUE PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARKS: THE MISS AMERICAN GREEN CROSS HAS KNOWN FAME AND OBLIVION SINCE ITS 
DEDICATION IN 1928. NOW ITS RESTORATION HAS SUFFERED A SETBACK. 
</P>

Her face is scarred and her arms are gone. She can no longer stand up without 
help. She spent years lost and neglected in an obscure Brand Park canyon, where 
vandals took potshots at her and the elements eroded her features. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendale officials say better days are ahead for Miss American Green Cross, 
a 62-year-old statue that was erected amid great fanfare by American Green 
Cross, a now-defunct organization committed to saving the nation's forests. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders say the statue has historic value, and they plan to spend 
thousands of dollars to restore her arms, refinish her bronze skin, rebuild her 
pedestal and put her back on public display. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the project remains strong, but the restoration of Miss American 
Green Cross suffered a slight setback last month. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale parks officials had chosen for the project local sculptor Ron Pekar, 
who said he could complete the work by November for $25,000. He said he would 
use modern materials that are more durable and vandal-resistant than the 
concrete-like substance originally used to form the cross behind the statue and 
the cluster of logs at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
But the Glendale Historic Preservation Commission gave the proposal a cool 
reception at its Sept. 17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission prefers to see it restored to its original condition in both 
materials and design," Commissioner William E. Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
"To do less, you're really not restoring, you're creating something new. We 
wouldn't have Miss American Green Cross. We'd have a new project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A further complication arose shortly before the meeting, when a Glendale 
history buff unearthed some old photos of the statue at the Los Angeles City 
Library. They showed that it originally stood upon a six-foot-high base, with 
inscriptions proclaiming the importance of forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it was a surprise to us," said Nello Iacono, the city's parks and 
recreation director. "We had never seen that base." 
</P>
<P>
Artist Pekar suggested that the mammoth base, if rebuilt, would dwarf the 
delicate five-foot-tall statue and detract from her beauty. Its size would also 
spoil a plan to put the statue in a small landscaped area near the Brand 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
But the Historic Preservation Commission urged that the large base be rebuilt 
because it was part of the original monument. "It's not so much the artistic 
quality. It's the history behind it that's important," Dodson said. 
</P>
<P>
Iacono has asked Pekar to draw up a new budget and schedule for rebuilding the 
base and restoring the statue with original materials. The new budget is 
expected to be higher and the project may not be completed until next spring, 
the parks director said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was briefly the center of civic attention, time has not been kind 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cheering onlookers attended her unveiling at the Glendale High 
School campus on April 23, 1928. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was a focal point for American Green Cross, but little is known 
today about the organization. Glendale officials have been unable to find any 
chapters that still exist. 
</P>
<P>
According to old news articles, the group was founded in Southern California on 
Dec. 3, 1926, as a successor to the American Reforestation Assn. It promoted 
the conservation of timber and other natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
One early Green Cross committee chairman urged that the group's national 
headquarters be established in his hometown, Santa Barbara, "because there are 
so many people here who have time to think about the important things of life." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the headquarters was established in early 1928 at Glendale's Sparr 
Heights community center, which was donated to the group. On April 5, 1928, 
Glendale also became the site of the nation's first local Green Cross chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the sculptor, Frederick Willard Potter, or his model, 
Verlyn Sumner, although they were on the speakers' platform during the 
unveiling of Miss American Green Cross. 
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, American Green Cross' popularity apparently waned, 
as did the city's enthusiasm for the statue. According to old news reports, art 
critics of the era dismissed the statue as "an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Sometime during the early 1930s, Miss American Green Cross was spirited away 
from the high school campus and deposited in the remote canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
She briefly re-entered the limelight in 1954, when reporters hiking in the 
Brand Park canyon stumbled upon the statue and dubbed it the mysterious "Green 
Cross Woman." The mystery was solved a few days later when the Glendale City 
Council, accompanied by civic activist Essie Morris Hughes, journeyed into the 
brush to inspect the find. 
</P>
<P>
"There's my statue!" exclaimed Hughes, who had founded the Junior Green Cross 
chapter for Glendale's schoolchildren many years earlier. Council members joked 
about who had removed the monument, "but not one suggestion was heard that she 
be returned to her place on Glendale High School grounds," the Glendale 
Independent reported. 
</P>
<P>
Miss American Green Cross remained in the canyon and was heavily damaged by 
vandals. Glendale's Historic Preservation Element, adopted in 1977, designated 
the statue as a landmark piece that should be relocated to a prominent place in 
Brand Park. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, her arms were gone, and her cross and logs had crumbled, 
parks director Iacono said. Since 1981, she has remained in storage at Brand 
Park's maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Historic Preservation Commission was formed to take a more 
aggressive role in saving important Glendale buildings and artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
During an Arbor Day speech last March, Iacono said the city's goal was to 
complete the monument's restoration by the end of the year, to coincide with 
the renovation of the park. He said the founders of American Green Cross were 
visionary and their message more timely than ever, in view of the current 
international concern over the loss of rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the restoration and permanent placement of Miss American Green Cross 
reaffirm our commitment to trees and the integral part they play in our 
environment," Iacono said.

A CREATIVE SALE OF STUDENT ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So you can't afford a David Hockney or an Ansel Adams, yet the desire still 
burns to possess an original work of art. 
</P>
<P>
Those willing to take a chance on an unknown artist might bag a future 
masterpiece at this weekend's student art sale at the Art Center College of 
Design in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the school's 60-year history that it has conducted a 
sale of student work, said Art Center spokeswoman Diane Reed. More than 500 
pieces will be available for purchase, including photographs, sculptures, 
illustrations, oil and water paintings, and even car models from the school's 
industrial design department. Prices will start at $10 and go up to $5,000, 
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting to know that these are the artists of the future, but you won't 
have to pay gallery prices 
</P>
<P>
to get their work," Reed said. Some of the students who created the art will be 
on hand to talk about their pieces and how best to display them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the two-day sale will be split, with 20% going to a school 
scholarship fund and the remaining 80% going to the student artists, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale idea was hatched after visitors to the campus art gallery hounded 
school administrators about purchasing the art they saw there. "This is a nice 
way to sell the work and raise some funds for scholarships," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale will be held at Art Center's downtown Pasadena campus, 54 W. Colorado 
Blvd., Pasadena on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
7 p.m. KAREN E. KLEIN

LEAFY STATES RAKE IN TOURISTS, NOT CASH

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert and Dawn Cimino stood above a mile-long gorge here, gazing at the 
brilliant array of fall foliage colors that dotted the mountains in the 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's breathtaking," said Robert Cimino, who along with his wife traveled here 
from New Jersey to catch a glimpse of northern New England's celebrated autumn 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have leaves in New Jersey, but they're just not this beautiful," Dawn 
Cimino said. 
</P>
<P>
The fall foliage, which many natives described as vintage quality, coupled with 
Indian summer weather, brought hundreds of thousands of travelers to Vermont, 
New Hampshire and other areas of New England over the last few weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the "leaf peekers" has been a bright spot in what tourism 
officials throughout the region agree has been an otherwise sluggish year. 
</P>
<P>
"The summer was flat," said Barnett D. Laschever, Connecticut's director of 
tourism. " . . . It's the general economic downtrend of the Northeast." 
</P>
<P>
A slowdown in tourism can have far-reaching effects, since the industry ranks 
the first- or second-largest in at least three New England states. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials said the problem for the industry has not been a decline in 
visitors. Most indicators show that the number of people traveling in the 
region has remained steady, and in some cases exceeded last year's totals. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount of money being spent by tourists is down, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very careful in how they spend their money," said John A. Johnson, 
senior official with the Maine Office of Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Densmore, an official at the White Mountain Visitors' Center in Lincoln, 
N.H., said she had noticed that visitors in area shops are not buying as much 
on impulse. "They are looking for bargains," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kipp Miller, who runs a gift shop at the Quechee Gorge state park in this town 
100 miles north of Boston, said there are more shoppers this year but "buying 
is more cautious." 
</P>
<P>
Some tourists at the park confirmed they are being more budget conscious as 
they travel. "We brought our lunch today. We would have stopped to eat" at a 
restaurant in other times, said Richard Sperry, visiting with his wife, Paula, 
from Troy, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also are shortening their stays at tourist spots, the industry experts 
said. "Dual-income families are taking long weekends instead of two-week 
vacations," said Chris A. Jennings, director of New Hampshire's Office of 
Vacation and Travel. 
</P>
<P>
But most tourism officials said there are silver linings. For instance, 
foreigners are spending more and their numbers appeared to increase this year. 
Foreign visitors have been attracted to the region by favorable exchange rates, 
said E. Ashley McCown, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Office of Travel and 
Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy them in Massachusetts, because they're coming a longer distance so 
they spend more money and stay longer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the economic slowdown has had its bright side, including that it has 
prompted many residents to vacation closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Smith, director of tourism for the Newport, R.I., Convention and Tourism 
Bureau, said the city has fared well this year because it is accessible to the 
New England tourist. "You don't have to take a four- or five-hour trip" to 
reach the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recession has also meant a boon to some sectors of the tourist industry. In 
Maine, "supermarkets had a pretty good summer," said Johnson, reflecting the 
fact that people were having more picnics to save on food costs. 
</P>
<P>
And tourist operators in general take solace in the fact that people still like 
to come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sorry people didn't spend money" this summer, Johnson said. "But the 
fact that they came, we're glad about."

STRATEGY: THE U.S. WORRIES THAT HUSSEIN MIGHT PULL BACK AND TRY TO HOLD ON TO 
THIS TERRITORY.

<P>
One of the reasons virtually no Western experts anticipated Iraq's annexation 
of Kuwait, officials now say, is that no one thought Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein had any interest in possessing most of the country. 
</P>
<P>
What Hussein wanted, the officials believe, was only a small part of his 
neighbor's land -- two strategic islands and a strip of territory covering the 
southern end of an oil field that straddles the Iraq-Kuwait border. 
</P>
<P>
Now, U.S. officials worry that Hussein might try to withdraw to that line, 
making a "concession" of land that he never really wanted so that he can hold 
onto what he really coveted all along. 
</P>
<P>
The territory in question has two major points of interest -- the Rumaila oil 
field, an oblong tract of land located mostly in Iraq with its southern end in 
Kuwait, and the two islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which together control the 
approaches to Iraq's chief port. 
</P>
<P>
Before the invasion, U.S. officials were neutral on the question of whether 
Iraq's claims to that land were valid. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with 
Kuwait," U.S. Ambassador April C. Glaspie told Hussein on July 25, in the last 
meeting between a U.S. official and the Iraqi president before the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the Bush Administration insists that Iraq must withdraw 
unconditionally from all Kuwaiti territory. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not think the emir (of Kuwait) should negotiate with a gun at his head," 
a senior Administration official said. Any territorial concessions that Kuwait 
might make while Iraqi troops remain on its soil would merely reward Iraqi 
aggression, Bush and his advisers argue. 
</P>
<P>
At various points in its history, Iraq has asserted claims to all of Kuwait, 
but the claims have been particularly insistent about Bubiyan and Warba. 
</P>
<P>
The islands are barren mud flats, useless for most purposes. But they are all 
that prevent virtually landlocked Iraq from being a nation with a 200-mile 
coastline and the potential to be the dominant naval power in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all Iraqi shipping from its ports at Basra and Umm al Qasr must sail 
around the two islands. A third port, Al Faw, was largely destroyed during the 
Iran-Iraq War and remains essentially closed. Its shipping lanes also are 
dominated by the Kuwaiti islands. 
</P>
<P>
Rumaila, meanwhile, is one of the Middle East's largest pools of oil. The field 
runs about 50 miles from north to south, with only two miles at the southern 
end lying inside Kuwait. Oil industry experts say that the field might still 
contain 30 billion barrels of oil, despite years of pumping. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Iran-Iraq War, Rumaila, where oil was discovered in 1953, was one of 
Iraq's biggest oil production centers. During the war, the Iraqis largely shut 
down the field to protect it from Iranian attacks. The Kuwaitis, meanwhile, 
continued to pump oil from their portion. 
</P>
<P>
According to Iraq, the Kuwaiti pumping effectively siphoned oil from Iraq's 
side of the field to Kuwait's, shifting resources 10,000 feet below ground in a 
way that damaged Iraq's interests. Saddam Hussein has claimed that Kuwait owes 
his country $2.4 billion for oil taken improperly from the Rumaila field. 
Kuwaiti officials have denied that charge. 
</P>
<P>
But some independent oil analysts say that the Iraqis may have a case -- 
although perhaps not for that full amount. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has declined to say how much of its oil comes from Rumaila, but industry 
analysts assume that the percentage is relatively small given how little of the 
field lies inside Kuwait. Most Kuwaiti oil lies in the southern part of the 
country, near the border with Saudi Arabia.

Map, Hussein's Possible Goals: Hussein might try to withdraw from Kuwait but 
retain what he really wanted all along: two strategic islands and a strip of 
territory covering the southern end of the Rumaila oil field on the Iraq-Kuwait 
border. The islands -- Bubiyan and Warba -- together control the approaches to 
Iraq's ports of Basra and Umm al Qasr. The latter is the home of an Iraqi naval 
base. Los Angeles Times

Bob Hope it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Entertaining homesick American soldiers overseas is as much a part of American 
military lore and legend as GI Joe and Hershey bars. And U.S. troops deployed 
in this barren desert kingdom have been waiting months for their first visit 
from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But when it finally happened Tuesday, the result was so disheartening that 
comedian Steve Martin offered a public apology -- and autographed pictures as 
consolation prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they didn't want us to do a show," Martin explained when soldiers, 
who had been waiting atop a sand dune for nearly three hours, pleaded for him 
at least to tell a few jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Under scorching sun on forbidding desert, this was USO entertainment, Desert 
Shield-style: No dancing girls, no stand-up comedy routines and precious few 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because this is Saudi Arabia, and the military isn't taking any chances. 
"I don't think anybody is ready for a USO show right now," a military official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As visitors in a society that permits no public entertainment, U.S. military 
officials have learned how easy it is to cross the line and offend their hosts. 
An early attempt at soldier-style diversion backfired when American employees 
of a Saudi oil company put on a show that included a risque dance number. 
Commanders quickly canceled further attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Now, commanders say, the troops have to be content with periodic concerts by 
divisional brass bands and the odd talent show. Mostly, the troops listen to 
music over headphones on personal stereos -- leaving camps oddly silent, 
without even the camaraderie of common song. 
</P>
<P>
And while the USO-sponsored visit this week by Martin and his wife, actress 
Victoria Tennant, marked an effort to break the routine, the limits were more 
striking than the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The 500 troops from the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division waited hours for 
Martin and clearly anticipated a show. They cheered when he arrived and again 
when he introduced Tennant. 
</P>
<P>
But the comedian, who climbed atop an M-1 tank bearing a sign inscribed "Speed 
and Power Beach Club," instead opted for earnest greetings from the home front. 
"We appreciate what you guys are doing," Martin said, "and there's a lot of 
support back home." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the bad news. "What we're gonna do is what they call grip and grin," 
Martin explained. "We grip your hand and grin at you. It's all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
The comedian and the actress made their way through the ranks, signing 
autographs and handing out cards and flyers to the soldiers. "Don't squeeze too 
hard," he told one who shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
When one soldier asked: "Can't you stay?" Martin ad-libbed, "Oh God, I've got a 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
The comedian's visit to this remote forward base camp was the third of five 
appearances scheduled for the day, and his outfit of combat fatigues and a red 
USO baseball hat was already adorned with flier's wings and other military 
emblems from his previous appearances. 
</P>
<P>
But in the entire visit, Martin delivered only one-liners relating to the gulf 
crisis: "I've got the answer for Saddam Hussein. If the press would just keep 
talking about his mistress, his wife would kill him." The joke got a laugh from 
the troops close enough to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
Martin told a pool group of reporters who attended the session that he decided 
to come to Saudi Arabia because he "felt guilty." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody coming out here, giving up part of their lives for this effort. I 
had some time off, and I felt kind of bad just sitting there," Martin said, "so 
I came."

CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;

<P>
ISRAELI ISSUES SEEN AS PERIL TO GULF ALLIANCE

Efforts to link Iraq's seizure of Kuwait with the Arab-Israeli conflict are 
threatening to open cracks in the Arab-Western alliance against Iraq, and the 
killing of 21 Palestinians by Israeli forces last week in Jerusalem has 
aggravated the situation, diplomats and analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel's action in Jerusalem has definitely put more pressure on the Western 
coalition," one British diplomat observed. "This will not help matters in the 
alliance." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Simon Lunn, an official with the North Atlantic Assembly in 
Brussels, asserted: "We say there's no linkage, but the shootings in Jerusalem 
reinforce what we know in reality: These two situations, in Arab eyes, are not 
unconnected." 
</P>
<P>
And France's President Francois Mitterrand has declared, "I don't want to mix 
these two questions, but one cannot try to defend human rights in one area and 
neglect them in another." 
</P>
<P>
European officials generally tend to resist connecting Iraq's seizure of Kuwait 
in August with Israel's seizure, in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, of the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip, but they take the position that Israel should negotiate 
with Palestinians at an international conference. Israel has rejected this 
view. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was among the most outspoken in warning 
that failure by the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israel could have 
jeopardized the united front against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very clear when talking to Arabs that the Arab-Israeli dispute is not 
like (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait," Hurd said. 
"Equally, when talking to Israel, we are all entitled to say: 'Is this what 
Israel is about, trying to bring about your own security by this kind of 
repression and denying all rights to the people whose territories you occupy?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Hurd believes in setting up an international conference on settling the 
Arab-Israeli dispute, but only after the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Angelika Volle, European specialist at the Foreign Policy Institute in Bonn, 
said the problem is that "European allies have never worked out a truly 
coordinated policy on the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Now, another potentially serious difference in the gulf conflict has surfaced 
between the United States and its European allies: what to do in the event 
Hussein decides to pull his forces out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt are 
inclined to punish Hussein even if he does withdraw. But most European 
countries -- and by far the majority of the United Nations -- reportedly would 
settle for withdrawal, which is all the various Security Council resolutions 
call for. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hussein does decide to pull out," one European diplomat in London said, 
"then there are going to be differing views on what to do next." 
</P>
<P>
Lunn noted: "Some observers are calling this the worst-case scenario: Saddam 
pulls out unpunished and remains in Baghdad, with sanctions removed, in a 
position to do it again. This could cause consternation, and one could see a 
breach among the members of the alliance on what to do next." 
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas argues that it is essential for Western 
Europe to provide protection for Palestinians living under Israeli rule or face 
Arab accusations that it is operating under a double standard in defending 
Kuwaitis but not Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, like Hurd and Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, is calling 
for a foreign ministers' conference to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Some British and American hard-liners fear that Mitterrand may be seeking an 
accord with Hussein that will fall short of total evacuation from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel, which has had no role in the anti-Iraq military buildup, has 
been the most persistent in warning that Hussein must be brought down. Its view 
has been supported by hawks in the United States, Britain and the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
As expressed by one diplomat in London, this view is as follows: "If Hussein is 
allowed to withdraw from Kuwait unpunished, he will remain strong, in control 
of his country, and in two or three years, with the oil flowing again, be in a 
position to undertake a massive attack with non-conventional weapons. The 
allied troops will have pulled out, and will we be prepared to deploy the same 
forces again to stop him?" 
</P>
<P>
Hans Binnendijk, director of studies at the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies in London, said: "Even in the U.S., there are divisions 
between the Pentagon, which doesn't want to let Hussein off the hook, and those 
who would settle for a pullout. Except for Britain, the European allies are in 
a much more cautious mode."

2 LIVE CREW TRIAL OPENS; DEFENSE OPPOSES INTRODUCTION OF TAPE

A prosecutor warned a jury of four women and two men Tuesday that they would 
hear "graphic depictions of sexual conduct . . . violent sex acts, and women 
being abused . . . " during the landmark obscenity trial of the controversial 
rap group 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for band leader Luther Campbell countered that "certainly (the 
songs) are sexually related, but sex is not verboten in this country. This is 
not about offending people. This is about a legal test." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and two other band members, Mark Ross and Chris Wongwon, face 
misdemeanor obscenity charges in a case that has raised important legal 
questions over censorship and cultural values. If convicted, each faces up to a 
year in prison and fines of up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial opened, the attorneys agreed with Judge June Johnson that 
observers under 18 should be barred from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Broward County prosecutor Leslie Robson said he would play a tape 
recording secretly made by an undercover sheriff's deputy who attended a June 
10 performance by the group at a Hollywood, Fla., nightclub. The microcassette 
recording was made three days after the group's album, "As Nasty as They Wanna 
Be," was declared obscene by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
Before the tape could be played to the jury, however, Bruce Rogow, attorney for 
Campbell, charged that it had been tampered with and was therefore not 
admissible as evidence. The tape the prosecution seeks to play for the jury has 
been digitally enhanced for clarity, and entire verses of some songs have been 
omitted, Rogow said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she would rule on Rogow's motion today. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the tape is played, Rogow expressed confidence that prosecutors would 
be unable to prove that the 2 Live Crew performance appealed to the prurient 
interests of the average Broward County resident and lacked any serious 
literary, artistic or political value. 
</P>
<P>
Rogow and Campbell freely admit that the lyrics of the black group's songs are 
raunchy, and probably offensive to many. But they also contend that the group 
has been singled out for prosecution by Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro. 
The band and some free-speech advocates contend the prosecution is rooted in 
whites' misunderstanding of black culture or animosity toward young blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the band was arrested, Ft. Lauderdale record store owner Charles 
Freeman was charged with selling an obscene album after an undercover sheriff's 
deputy bought a copy of "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." Two weeks ago an all-white 
jury found him guilty, marking the first time in U.S. history that anyone has 
been convicted of selling an obscene musical work. He is to be sentenced Nov. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors in the 2 Live Crew case were picked after six days of questioning. 
One is black, a 61-year-old woman. The two men, ages 24 and 26, are the 
youngest. The oldest juror is a 76-year-old woman, a retired sociology 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said Tuesday that the jury "ain't the group needed for this case, but 
we got to deal with what we got. Based on the people we've seen, they're OK."

The committee also included language empowering the NEA to require grant

INSURANCE PLANNED FOR WORKERS AT RISK OF AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DOCTORS, NURSES AND FIREFIGHTERS ARE AMONG THE TARGETED PROFESSIONS. 
POLICIES WOULD BE PAYABLE IN A LUMP SUM UPON PROOF OF INFECTION.

At least three U.S. companies plan to market insurance specifically designed to 
protect people whose jobs could expose them to AIDS-infected individuals, such 
as health care workers, emergency medical technicians and firefighters, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The policies, which vary in approach, would be available to uninfected 
individuals who in the course of their jobs are likely to come into contact 
with people infected with the virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
They would be payable in a lump sum upon proof of infection. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed coverage already is being condemned by many in the AIDS community 
who contend that the companies are preying on fears of AIDS transmission in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
MSG &amp; Associates, a management company in Roswell, Ga., has proposed 
marketing a plan that would allow individuals to buy $25,000 "units" of 
coverage, up to a maximum amount of $250,000, for an annual premium of $500. 
The policies would be backed by Lloyds of London. 
</P>
<P>
A confidential memorandum sent by the company to prospective board members and 
obtained by The Times projects that the policies would generate after-tax 
earnings of $40.4 million the first year and $109 million the second year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not concerned with lifestyles -- we are aiming at a risk profession," 
said George Harris, executive vice president of the company. "We are 
approaching this in a lump sum payment, rather than a reimbursement for costs. 
The advantages are that these people will be able to live with dignity, have an 
income, and pursue treatment as they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
At least two other companies, Intec CCS of West Palm Beach, Fla., and 
International Insurance Designs of Columbia, Md., are proposing similar plans, 
although their coverage is targeted at groups of five or more and probably will 
be marketed through hospitals or unions. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of physicians and nurses "can be faced with treating an AIDS patient 
at any time of the day and they don't even know it," said Larry Cumbie, a 
representative of Intec CCS, which is designing a group policy for health care 
workers at risk for the human immunodeficiency virus. "The product is designed 
to protect . . . against the possibility they could become infected. It will 
enable them to leave something behind." 
</P>
<P>
Cumbie said the annual premium would be based on a percentage of an 
individual's salary, generally about 3%, with the benefit totaling up to 2 1/2 
times the annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
International Insurance Designs also intends to market HIV group health 
insurance to health care professionals similarly, with benefits ranging from 
one to 2 1/2 times a person's annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the American Medical Assn. and the International Assn. of Fire 
Fighters said that their organizations do not endorse such insurance programs 
and emphasized that, although the occupational risk of HIV infection is real, 
it is still extremely small. 
</P>
<P>
There have been only 37 documented cases of HIV infection through occupational 
exposure since the federal government began keeping records in 1981, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC has said, however, that there 
probably are a number of unreported cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers should be aware of the low incidence (of infection) as they consider 
their need and the price of the insurance," said Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, the AMA's 
senior vice president for medical education and science. "Eating breakfast is 
not without some risk to your well-being in life, yet I don't think everyone 
would go out and buy insurance to protect themselves from the risks of eating 
breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the AMA, however, strongly advocates development of policies 
covering acute and chronic health care costs and disability for medical 
professionals, particularly in cases involving infection with HIV or hepatitis 
B, another life-threatening illness considered a serious risk for health care 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from AIDS-related organizations attacked the insurance plans as 
seeking to make money off fears of contracting AIDS in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I have spent the last eight years of my life working to fight unwarranted fear 
of AIDS," Jeff Levi, an AIDS policy consultant, wrote in a letter to MSG &amp; 
Associates in response to a request to join its board. "Your proposed insurance 
plan does exactly the opposite: it takes advantage of people's fears . . . and 
seeks to profit from those fears." 
</P>
<P>
MSG's Harris denied Levi's characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as people take out earthquake and flood insurance, they hope it never 
occurs," he said. "But should it occur, they want to be covered. We hope for an 
early cure of this disease. But until that time, we want people . . . to know 
if they contract the virus, they have coverage."

$8.3 MILLION IN PORT FUNDS OKD FOR CUP; 
</P>
<P>
YACHTING: ORGANIZERS, HOWEVER, ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT COMMISSIONERS REFUSE TO 
FUND A REGATTA-RELATED ROSE PARADE FLOAT, CEREMONIES AND FESTIVALS.

<P>
The America's Cup Organizing Committee went to the San Diego Unified Port 
District Tuesday to ask for money, and, after three hours of often-tense 
commentary and interrogation, walked away with 90% of what it wanted -- in 
round numbers, $8,281,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC had originally asked for $10.6 million and had whittled that request 
to $9.1 million. Although approving all budgetary line items "in concept," the 
Board of Port Commissioners refused to allocate money for the three that 
triggered the most argument: 
</P>
<P>
* An America's Cup-Port District float in the Tournament of Roses Parade: 
$142,000. 
</P>
<P>
* America's Cup opening ceremonies: $431,000. 
</P>
<P>
* America's Cup festivals: $237,500. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the port agreed to spend $2.3 million toward a $4.4-million 
renovation of the B Street Pier, which will be used as the America's Cup 
headquarters and as Port District office space after the race is over. That 
expenditure was considered separately from Tuesday's request. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's hearing, the port has agreed to provide $6,859,000 in cash, 
with the rest coming in the form of "in-kind" services to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We're under way, we're moving," Malin Burnham, head of the ACOC, said 
afterward. "We've taken a giant step forward. We're very appreciative of the 
port's efforts." 
</P>
<P>
But both Burnham and Tom Ehman, general manager of the ACOC, said they were 
disappointed about falling short. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I wish they'd gone in total for what we asked for," Burnham said. 
"That's why I honestly and sincerely asked them to go in total. You always want 
to get what you asked for." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said his excitement was tempered both by falling short of the full amount 
and by the reality that the America's Cup-class World Championship regatta, 
scheduled for next year in San Diego, "is only 199 days away." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared at times during Tuesday's session that the Cup committee might walk 
away empty-handed. A motion by Commissioner Dan Larsen, the committee's biggest 
backer on the board, to approve the $9.1 million was defeated in a 3-3 tie. 
</P>
<P>
(Commissioner Delton Reopelle, who recently underwent surgery, was absent from 
Tuesday's meeting, and, whenever a tie results, parliamentary policy dictates 
that the measure is defeated.) 
</P>
<P>
Port commissioners then considered each of several expenditures line by line, 
and all were approved "in concept" -- with Commissioners Lynn Schenk and 
Clifford Graves casting most of the no votes. The board then voted to allocate 
funds for all but three. 
</P>
<P>
The $142,000 requested for an America's Cup-Port District Rose Parade float 
called for $21,000 to be spent on costumes and $18,000 on flowers and 
miscellaneous items. 
</P>
<P>
Schenk, who voted against four proposals -- the fourth being an America's Cup 
Museum -- questioned the need for public expenditures in the face of the 
potential from corporate and individual donors. 
</P>
<P>
"It should come from the business community," she said of the committee's 
requests for money. "There's no question that that's where the bulk of their 
support should be. Malin Burnham and others say funds from the private sector 
need to be reserved for the defense of the Cup itself, to build the best racing 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But surely, in all of the state and all of the country, there's corporations 
that would love to spend money on this event. I think they ought to be asked." 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners questioned the public-private partnership that Burnham 
and other committee figures said they envisioned in approaching the port. 
</P>
<P>
After Port District counsel Joe Patello questioned the legality of such a 
partnership and whether many of the expenditures fell within the purview of the 
port's "trust," Burnham approached the lectern to implore the board to "invest 
a few dollars" on outside legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
To that remark, Patello responded angrily, "We don't need outside legal 
counsel!" 
</P>
<P>
In defense of budgetary items -- and the $9.1 million he argued passionately 
for -- Burnham said he was not so much asking the port to trust him as he was 
his and his staff's judgment on how to put together a "world-class" event. 
</P>
<P>
Several pro-Cup spokesmen called the America's Cup the third-most important 
sporting event in the world, behind the World Cup soccer competition and the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking you for a net $4-million investment over the course of three 
fiscal years to put on something most of the world would kill to have," Burnham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham's committee presented several speakers, including a representative of 
Board of Supervisors Chairman Leon Williams, who wrote a telling letter 
emphasizing the event's cultural and educational possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego City Councilman Bill Cleator argued on behalf of the $9.1 
million, saying the event would enhance the cruise-ship industry, in which he 
has extensive dealings. Cleator said several international cruise lines, which 
have never been to San Diego, plan to dock here during the finals in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not fattening our own pocketbooks," Cleator argued. "Oh, sure, there 
will be an economic return when people come in and dump a billion dollars into 
our local economy, but mainly, we want to leave our fingerprint on this as a 
world-class event." 
</P>
<P>
Several economic experts alluded to a University of San Diego study estimating 
the regatta's impact on the local economy at almost $1 billion. Despite that 
argument, several speakers questioned exactly who would benefit from such a 
windfall -- would it, indeed, be the community as a whole, or just a few people 
who already qualify as wealthy? 
</P>
<P>
A few speakers, such as Elizabeth Lucas of the Environmental Health Coalition, 
questioned the port's priorities in involving itself in a yacht race when, she 
said, "San Diego Bay is badly in need of being cleaned up. Is a yacht race more 
important than getting rid of toxic pollution?" 
</P>
<P>
Ehman, of the organizing committee, said the event already has attracted 12 
challengers from a record 10 nations, some of which are already setting up 
headquarters in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mitchell of the organizing committee said the next step is for a 
port-appointed ad hoc committee to sit down with Cup officials and the port's 
own staff and work out a process by which the money and in-kind services will 
be provided. 
</P>
<P>
Although the port rejected the allocation of money for line items involving a 
Rose Parade float and the Cup's opening ceremonies and festivals, Burnham said 
he hoped to negotiate further with the district to obtain funds for those 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," he said, "they did approve them in concept. Now we just need the 
money."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: OPEN WIDE, PLEASE, AND SAY 'ALLAH'

<P>
An amulet a day keeps the doctor away. Or: Spread a little of that camel dung 
on my aching back, please. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military troops in Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield continue to 
encounter the difficulties posed by heat, sand, scorpions and cultural 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
A confidential U.S. military memo being circulated to medical personnel both in 
Saudi Arabia and stateside, including locally, warns about the differences 
between the American and Saudi views of health and healing. 
</P>
<P>
For example, don't expect a blood drive in downtown Riyadh to be very 
successful: 
</P>
<P>
"A large segment of the population believes that donating blood adversely 
affects sexuality; this belief greatly impedes efforts to collect blood, even 
if a relative's life depends on it." 
</P>
<P>
Treatment of disease among nomadic tribes still follows "ancient barbaric 
practices." To wit: 
</P>
<P>
"For pain relief, the common practice is to apply heat. Hot irons are used to 
brand infected areas and then hot camel dung is applied. Dental treatment 
consists of pointed sticks plugged into cavities to relieve toothaches." 
</P>
<P>
The memo provides strict rules to follow when "treating indigenous personnel in 
the Persian Gulf area of operations." 
</P>
<P>
Never touch, speak to or make eye contact with an Arab woman. Never turn off 
the lights when examining either a man or woman, even to do an eye exam. 
</P>
<P>
Never say admiring things about an Arab child because it might be perceived as 
an evil gesture. Never remove amulets (usually shaped like an eye or hand) from 
adults or children. 
</P>
<P>
There has already been one culture clash, the memo says, when an "American 
female flight line worker scandalized Saudi military personnel by removing her 
uniform and working in a T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
As for U.S. military women, they can forget about sightseeing. The Saudi 
religious police are ever watchful. 
</P>
<P>
The eyes-only memo notes that there are two ways foreign women are not to be 
seen in public in Saudi Arabia. If they're not escorted by men. If they are 
escorted by men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ante Up 
</P>
<P>
It's in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
As proprietors of city-regulated businesses, the operators of San Diego card 
rooms have started to contribute to City Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the council voted 6 to 3 to help card rooms become more profitable 
by increasing the hourly rate they can charge players. 
</P>
<P>
The move was vigorously opposed by Police Chief Bob Burgreen, who says 
undercover cops have spotted cheating, bookmaking and drugs at card rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the six council members siding with the card rooms over the police chief 
have received campaign contributions from card room proprietors: Bob Filner and 
Abbe Wolfsheimer. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego school board race between Scott Harvey and John de Beck should 
heat up considerably today when the two debate for an hour (11 a.m. to noon) on 
KSDO radio. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey plans to poke De Beck, a retired teacher, about a commentary he wrote 
several years ago for the teachers union newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
In it, De Beck endorsed the controversial idea that teachers have the right to 
strike to resolve contract disputes with the school board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full-Time Retiree 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy is counting the days until retirement: 82 as of today. He's 
also planning to keep busy. 
</P>
<P>
He will be part-time executive director of the National Sheriff's Institute, an 
arm of the National Sheriff's Assn., based in Alexandria, Va. He will organize 
workshops and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
He's also going to work with a developer to build a recreational camp in San 
Diego County for law enforcement personnel and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy says he has three ironclad rules for job offers: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to work for government. I don't want to work full time. And I 
don't want to work with the news media."

POWAY WINS ROAD WAR WITHOUT FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poway City Council members went into executive session Tuesday night determined 
to take off the kid gloves and put on the boxing gloves in their effort to 
force the city of San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Poway officials emerged, they were winners without striking a 
blow. The San Diego City Council had voted earlier Tuesday to reopen the road 
as soon as construction of a new Pomerado Road is finished -- probably within 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
Poway City Manager Jim Bowersox said he had received the report of the San 
Diego council's action -- also taken in closed session -- too late to notify 
the Poway council members and the public. The Poway council had been expected 
to vote to bring suit against the bigger city over the closure. 
</P>
<P>
Old Pomerado Road, a tortuous, hilly climb from the Poway valley up to the San 
Diego mesa where Scripps Ranch homes now stand, was closed Nov. 7, 1988, after 
the city of San Diego annexed an island of unincorporated and uninhabited land 
between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the reason for closing the popular shortcut from Poway south to San 
Diego was to reconstruct the old stagecoach route to meet urban traffic safety 
standards, John Fowler, then San Diego assistant city manager, admitted that 
pressure from Scripps Ranch residents had had a part in the closure. He 
predicted that Pomerado Road would not be opened until Poway and developers 
completed a direct road to I-15, paralleling Poway Road to the south and taking 
the pressure of through traffic off Pomerado. 
</P>
<P>
Poway has built part of the road -- known as South Poway Parkway -- but 
developers were less anxious to spend about $30 million to complete it through 
the San Diego portion linking to I-15 when the housing projects they had 
planned were being held up by the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But last month the standoff over development around Miramar Lake was resolved 
in a compromise, and major developers promised to begin immediately to build 
the bypass, which is expected to be completed in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that San Diego cannot close Pomerado Road any longer than the 
construction period," said Poway City Atty. Stephen Eckis. "The city (San 
Diego) is obligated to open the road when it is completed." 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think that there is any doubt about it," Eckis said of the 
illegality of keeping Pomerado closed. "It is a pretty clear-cut legal 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Bren Development, which plans to build a major subdivision in the formerly 
unincorporated area, has a major stake in the issue. It can't cash in on a 
commitment from Poway to provide sewer services to the subdivision until city 
of San Diego engineers certify that the road is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerado "was a regional road before any of us came to live in the county," 
Eckis said. It was U.S. Highway 395 before the interstate (I-15) was built." 
</P>
<P>
The two cities are also collaborating on several joint projects, including a 
major sewer and water reclamation plant, which, several Poway city officials 
acknowledged, had prompted Poway to back off from any direct confrontation on 
the Pomerado Road issue. 
</P>
<P>
But, as traffic backs up to "an impossible level" along Poway Road -- the 
city's main thoroughfare -- as commuters from Poway and the growing backcountry 
town of Ramona try to reach the freeway to San Diego, Poway City Manager Jim 
Bowersox acknowledges, "We have to do something about Pomerado Road." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to negotiate with San Diego over the road opening have not had much 
effect. Offers to restrict all truck traffic generated by the fast-expanding 
Poway industrial park, so that Pomerado will become no more crowded than it was 
before its closure, did not change the big city's mind, Eckis said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowersox said Tuesday night that the road opening is subject to conditions 
negotiated between officials of the two cities. He did not specify what those 
conditions were, but they are expected to limit truck traffic and keep traffic 
at the same level as it was before the closure two years ago.

EDUCATION: NEWBURY PARK HIGH SCHOOL GETS A SPECIAL LESSON ON DISABILITIES 
BEFORE HANDICAPPED STUDENTS ARRIVE AT THE CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stand-up comedian speaking to students at Thousand Oaks' Newbury Park High 
School Tuesday had a wicked wit and a sarcasm-tinged view of the world that 
left the student body roaring with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Geri Jewell has cerebral palsy. As she addressed the 1,400 
students assembled in the school gym about accepting people with disabilities 
-- including more than 30 disabled students from the county-run Dean Triggs 
School who will move to the campus in November -- one thing was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Jewell was funny, even when joking about her own disability and how others 
perceive it. 
</P>
<P>
"I have cerebral palsy, or let's call it CP for short -- it's easier to spell," 
said Jewell, 34, who was born with the nervous disorder. "Don't confuse it with 
MD, VD, AT&amp;T or PMS . . . Having CP is like having cable television without 
paying for it. You get the picture but it's all scrambled." 
</P>
<P>
Behind Jewell's jokes, there was a serious purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday marked the first encounter between Newbury Park students and Triggs 
students, who will move four miles from a site near the Thousand Oaks Public 
Library to portable classrooms on the Newbury Park campus. 
</P>
<P>
The move was ordered by state education officials in 1988 after inspectors 
found that Triggs students were isolated, in violation of a federal law that 
requires handicapped students to be integrated into regular campuses and given 
an opportunity to interact with non-handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
All of Triggs' 65 students, ranging from 3 to 22 years old, are being 
relocated. In addition to the high school transfer, about 35 younger students 
will be moved to Conejo Elementary School next spring, Triggs Principal Barbara 
Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Triggs students have a variety of disabilities including medical problems, 
retardation, deafness and blindness, said Diana Novak, director of special 
education for the county superintendent of schools office. 
</P>
<P>
Novak said state inspectors review special education facilities every three 
years and will return to look at Ventura County campuses, including the new 
Triggs site, next spring. The other 10 county-run special schools are near 
regular campuses and in compliance with federal law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Triggs students are moved, the county will return the present 
eight-room Triggs school to the Conejo Valley district from which it is leased, 
Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
Under integration, Triggs students will share lunch periods, breaks, assemblies 
and other activities as their abilities allow, Novak said. Their classroom 
program, however, will remain separate. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth transition for both groups of students, officials from the 
county schools office and the Conejo Valley Unified School District asked 
Jewell to address all the students about sensitivity to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Jewell, also an actress best known for her appearances on the television series 
"Facts of Life," made light of cerebral palsy in an attempt to urge the 
students to see beyond such differences. 
</P>
<P>
"CP has never been my problem in life," Jewell said. "My problem is the 
perception of CP. People think I'm on drugs all the time . . . I am perceived 
in so many ways as I walk through life. It teaches me not to be so quick to 
judge people." 
</P>
<P>
Jewell cautioned that bringing the Triggs students to the campus is only a 
first step toward integrating them into campus life. 
</P>
<P>
"They can have all the opportunity in the world, but if they aren't accepted, 
all that training doesn't work," Jewell said. "I'm not saying you have to like 
all disabled students, because that's not reality." Instead, she urged students 
to try to be as open and friendly to their new classmates as they would to any 
other student, especially in social situations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to allow ourselves to look at people, and not their disabilities," 
Jewell said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they hope Tuesday's program will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"At high school age, kids tend to have these little prejudices," said Stephen 
I. Gordon, special education coordinator for the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District. The program "initiates students to the concept that kids who are 
handicapped aren't different." 
</P>
<P>
For parents of Triggs students, one of the biggest questions is whether the new 
facilities will be as good as the old, said Triggs PTA President Desley 
Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be interesting to see how it all happens and how much integration 
actually takes place," Boardman said. "I believe in integration. I think it's a 
wonderful thing, but I also hate to give up something we know works." 
</P>
<P>
Parents are concerned because the new classrooms are smaller and bathrooms will 
be down the hall rather than between classrooms, making them less accessible, 
Boardman said. 
</P>
<P>
After Jewell's presentation, Newbury Park students gave the Triggs students 
single, long-stemmed roses and cards emblazoned with the school's Panther 
mascot that read: "Welcome to Newbury High School from your new friends." 
</P>
<P>
Some said they are ready to make room for the students on their campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea that they be a part of our school," said ninth-grade 
student Justin Lees-Smith, 14.

NO THREAT OF EVICTION, MAYOR SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: O'CONNOR AND A FEDERAL OFFICIAL HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO ALLAY 
TENANTS' FEARS IN DISPUTE OVER SALE OF TWO LOW-INCOME APARTMENT COMPLEXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to allay apprehensions over possible evictions at two low-income 
apartment complexes, San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor and a top federal housing 
official said Tuesday that a dispute over the projects' proposed sale will not 
cause residents to lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
At a City Hall news conference, O'Connor and Robert de Monte, regional 
administrator of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
emphasized that federal housing laws probably will enable the more than 800 
low-income units in Clairemont and Rancho Penasquitos to be preserved, 
regardless of the outcome of the projects' proposed $38.5-million sale. 
</P>
<P>
"There were rumors that . . . the low-income tenants (might) be thrown out into 
the street within a month," O'Connor said. "That's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's news conference expanded the city's public relations campaign to 
quell residents' fears over the future of the 312-unit Mt. Aguilar and 504-unit 
Penasquitos Gardens apartments. On Monday, the council voted to guarantee that 
the two projects remain low-income complexes, even if the city's current bid to 
buy them fails. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city's effort to acquire the two apartment projects to preserve 
them for low-income residents became mired in controversy when it was revealed 
that Alvin I. Malnik, the Florida businessman who owns them, has a lengthy 
history of purported underworld connections. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the city should not "do business with the mob," O'Connor and some other 
council members have said that, unless Malnik can satisfactorily explain the 
allegations about his background, the proposed sale should be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
But some San Diego housing officials have warned that the city could lose 816 
scarce low-income apartments housing more than 3,000 people if Malnik decides 
instead to try to sell the apartments to a private buyer or convert them to 
market-rate rentals. 
</P>
<P>
De Monte, however, stressed that the 1987 Housing Act established two very 
stringent conditions for HUD approval of such conversions or sales: The change 
must not have a negative impact on low-income people or a disproportionate 
discriminatory effect on any ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
"That is virtually impossible to reach that conclusion in California given 
today's market," De Monte said. As a result, HUD usually turns down owners' 
requests that they be allowed to prepay the low-interest federal loans used to 
construct their low-income projects -- a request that Malnik will be eligible 
to make next May, De Monte said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the agency then begins negotiations over a so-called "plan of 
action" intended to preserve the projects as low-income units while also 
offering enhanced financial incentives to owners. 
</P>
<P>
Under those plans, HUD provides rental subsidies to the very lowest-income 
residents, while those who earn slightly more may be required to pay up to 30% 
of their salary for rent, De Monte added. In return for the added revenue they 
provide to the projects' owners, the subsidies require that the complexes 
involved be maintained as low-income units. 
</P>
<P>
The "crisis mentality" surrounding the two San Diego projects, the HUD official 
said, stems from the fact that the sales moratorium included in the 1987 
housing legislation was scheduled to expire Sept. 30. That deadline has been 
extended to Oct. 31 to give Congress more time to approve a measure that would 
continue the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we're going to get a housing bill; we just don't know when," De Monte 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress has not enacted the housing bill by month's end, De Monte said, he 
expects that the moratorium will be extended again pending final action. 
However, should that not happen, Malnik or other owners of low-income units 
conceivably could prepay their federal loans, freeing them of any obligation to 
continue to use their projects for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be extremely surprised if Congress permitted that to happen," De Monte 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's investigation into Malnik's background is continuing and 
is expected to be completed within two to four weeks, according to Councilwoman 
Linda Bernhardt, who chairs the city's Housing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada and New Jersey gaming commission reports, newspaper stories and books 
link Malnik to a variety of reputed organized crime figures, including longtime 
mob financial leader Meyer Lansky. In a letter to O'Connor and recent 
interviews, Malnik has denied any involvement or links with organized crime, 
characterizing the charges as "total falsehoods and innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
Both O'Connor and Councilman Bruce Henderson, who disclosed the allegations 
about Malnik, argue that, unless the Floridian can provide a "benign" 
explanation, the city should pursue other options in regard to the two 
projects, including the use of HUD regulations to maintain their low-income 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this theory in the community that you didn't have a choice," 
O'Connor said. "It was Mr. Malnik or nothing. That's not the case. . . . There 
are other alternatives out there."

WATER DISTRICT MAY START OWN PROGRAM

County budget cuts that slashed $42,000 from the Ventura County Water 
Conservation Management Program have prompted one key water wholesaler to 
question whether it should continue to pour money into the program. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas Municipal Water District officials are debating whether to mount a 
conservation program for their own customers instead of continuing to 
contribute $25,000 to $35,000 annually to the countywide program. 
</P>
<P>
"We only provide 5% of the water in the county, and to fund 25% of the program 
seems unfair," said Al Aviles, a Casitas board member. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting will be held Nov. 3 to evaluate the program's goals in light of a 
reduced budget that has left it, among other things, one person short of its 
expected staff level this year, said Nancy Settle, county Resource Management 
Agency planning manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue, but there are some things we won't be able to do," Settle 
said. "Due to the drought condition, it's become even more critical to have an 
effective program." 
</P>
<P>
Casitas, Calleguas Municipal Water District and United Water Conservation 
District have shared the cost of the public information program with the county 
since 1984, although about 30 agencies such as cities and farming organizations 
participate in its services. 
</P>
<P>
However, due to the county's inability to put in $42,000 this year, Casitas and 
Calleguas have reduced their funding levels from the $35,000 each had 
originally budgeted to $28,750. United's officials had already decided not to 
put in the full $35,000 because they run their own conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
The county program came out of a 1983 water management plan required by the 
state for an $8-million grant to prevent seawater intrusion under the Oxnard 
Plain. It meets the state's legal requirements for water purveyors to carry out 
such programs by providing water conservation literature, school programs, a 
speakers bureau, water efficiency seminars for farmers, landscape water audits 
and other services. THIA BELL

GALLEGLY RULES OUT PRE-ELECTION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After being criticized by a debate moderator for not appearing at a candidate 
forum Tuesday, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said he has no intention of 
debating his opponents before Election Day, especially since Congress is trying 
to forge a new budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The two-term congressman's decision not to participate via satellite from 
Washington raised protests from his Democratic challenger and the League of 
Women Voters of Ventura County, the event's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"Elton Gallegly is scared to death that if he has any appearance he'll be shown 
to have no grasp of the issues," said Richard Frieman, an Agoura attorney 
running as a Democrat. "He's a backbencher in the House and now he's hiding 
out." 
</P>
<P>
"It defeats the election process when voters do not have an opportunity to hear 
their candidates," said Grace Bernstein, the league's director for Simi Valley 
and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted in Washington by phone Tuesday during a break in budget 
deliberations, Gallegly said he feels no need to appear at candidate forums 
with Frieman or Libertarian candidate Peggy Christensen because his voting 
record in Congress speaks for him. Gallegly also did not debate his opponent in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why I don't feel a debate is that critical or is in the public 
interest is that my record is a very public one," Gallegly said. "Voters can 
call my office and get my record on any issue they want that's important to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
KADY-TV staged the forum at its Oxnard offices with a symbolic empty chair for 
Gallegly, just as it did last Friday when Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) did not appear at a similar forum. In a concession not made to 
Lagomarsino, station executives offered to arrange a satellite broadcast from 
Washington for Gallegly, who said the program would require too much 
preparation and would take him from the House floor. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

WELL REACTIVATED AT COUNTY CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to reactivate a well at the 
County Government Center in Ventura because the county exceeded a city-imposed 
water limit last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Because of heavy watering at the center, the county used nearly 2 million 
gallons over the water limit imposed last spring by Ventura as a 
drought-fighting measure. 
</P>
<P>
The well, in operation from 1932 to 1982, doesn't meet drinking water standards 
because of its salt content, said Peter S. Pedroff, director of the county's 
General Services Agency. But it could be used for irrigation and to cut down on 
the county's need for potable city water, he said. The well could be in 
operation by November at a cost of about $25,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The well water must be used generously, he said, because its salt content could 
damage grass, plants and trees if too little is used. 
</P>
<P>
Signs would be installed to tell passers-by that the county isn't wasting 
drinking water to irrigate county grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pedroff said the county stayed under its city water allocation during the last 
billing period, which ended Monday, because of several water-conservation 
practices that were imposed. JANE HULSE

ALLERT SAYS BOLAND WAFFLED ON ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic Assembly candidate Irene Allert, speaking Tuesday at a candidates 
forum, accused her Republican opponent Paula Boland of changing her position on 
several controversial state and local issues. Holding up a box of frozen 
waffles, Allert said Boland in recent months has altered her positions on 
offshore oil drilling, term limits for state officeholders and the massive 
Porter Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, who is considered the front-runner in the 38th Assembly District race, 
cited her involvement in securing state funds for the Simi Valley Freeway 
improvements and her work on other local civic projects during opening remarks 
before more than 200 local realty agents, property owners and business people. 
</P>
<P>
Boland and Allert are battling to succeed Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette 
(R-Northridge), who is retiring after a decade in the Legislature. The race has 
drawn attention as the only one for state office in the San Fernando Valley 
this year in which no incumbent is running. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 50, has stressed her anti-crime position and her credentials as a 
conservative and longtime foot soldier in local GOP circles. She also has vowed 
to continue La Follette's long but thus far futile fight to carve the Los 
Angeles Unified School District into smaller units. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, 46, is campaigning as an abortion-rights advocate and an opponent of 
the massive Porter Ranch development in the Chatsworth hills north of the Simi 
Valley Freeway. She is supported by a number of women's groups and labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say Boland is the probable winner in the 38th District, 
which forms a rough horseshoe-shaped area across the Valley from Hidden Hills 
in the west to La Crescenta in the east and where Republicans outnumber 
Democrats 83,000 to 72,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Boland holds a large fund-raising lead over Allert, taking in 
$102,000 to Allert's $43,000 in the reporting period that ended Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement Tuesday night, Allert said the campaign has "taken on 
a completely new symbol" as she held up the box of frozen blueberry waffles. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several areas where my opponent has waffled," Allert said. 
</P>
<P>
Allert said that during the spring primary election Boland said she opposed 
term limits for state Assembly and Senate members. More recently however, 
Boland has expressed support for Proposition 140, which limits Assembly terms 
to six years and state Senate terms to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
However, Boland campaign manager Mark Q. Thompson denied that Boland has 
shifted her position. Thompson said after the forum that Boland opposes a 
different term limitation initiative, Proposition 131, because it would also 
use tax dollars to finance political campaigns. He said Boland supports 
Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
The forum was sponsored by area business organizations. Organizers invited four 
Valley-area congressman -- Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), but none of them showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents each cited pressing business in Washington, Board of Realtors 
spokeswoman Millie Jones said.

COUNCIL OFFERS CLEANUP IN LIEU OF BIG LANDFILL FINES; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON: THE PROPOSAL IS THE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOUTH COAST 
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday offered to fund a $150,000 household 
hazardous waste cleanup program in lieu of paying hefty civil fines for air 
pollution violations at the city-owned Lopez Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi and Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff predicted that 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District will accept the offer and drop 
numerous air pollution citations it issued against the Lake View Terrace 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is a product of lengthly negotiations between the city and the 
AQMD, which could have sought fines of up to $700,000 for 28 violations, 
Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the AQMD has repeatedly cited the city for allowing 
excessive amounts of methane gas to escape from the dump. Odors at the landfill 
have prompted protests from nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who represents the northeast Valley and has been an outspoken critic 
of the landfill, endorsed Tuesday's settlement offer. "It's a big improvement," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the council agreed Tuesday to pay a $5,000 fine for each violation of 
AQMD air pollution regulations at the dump found after Jan. 31, 1991. The city 
agreed to pay a $5,000 fine as a concession to the AQMD, which typically seeks 
$1,000 for each landfill emission violation, Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions backed by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a Lopez Canyon 
critic, the city would pay any future fines into a city-controlled trust 
account to be used for local environmental projects. 
</P>
<P>
Such projects could include anything from tree plantings to buying recreational 
facilities, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The initial $150,000 will be used exclusively to finance a project to collect 
and properly dispose of household hazardous wastes in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and neighbors of the landfill have complained that the city 
has not done enough to ensure that common hazardous wastes -- including motor 
oil, paint and insecticides -- are not buried at Lopez Canyon, the major 
dumping ground for city-collected residential garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement offer approved Tuesday by the council is part of a wider city 
plan to clean up Lopez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Sept. 18 authorized spending $3.2 million to upgrade its methane 
gas abatement system at Lopez Canyon, including the drilling of about 100 
additional gas wells at Lopez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The system collects the methane gas generated by the decaying garbage and burns 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
Westhoff said the city has 153 wells at the landfill and expects to have 200 by 
mid-November.

OFFICIALS LEAD CRITICISM OF PROPOSALS FOR 4 LANDFILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 boisterous anti-dump activists from the San Fernando, Santa Clarita 
and Simi valleys strongly denounced plans Tuesday night to open landfills in 
mountain canyons ringing the valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The first of several dozen speakers, Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, summed 
up the feelings of many at the public hearing at Kennedy High School in Granada 
Hills. A proposed integrated waste management plan, she said, "won't manage 
solid waste, it will only bury it. . . . It is a thinly disguised program to 
put landfills away from the centers of political power." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held to collect public comments on the environmental impact 
report prepared on four proposed canyon dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The report said landfills could be operated safely in Blind Canyon above 
Chatsworth, Towsley Canyon a few miles south of Six Flags Magic Mountain, 
Elsmere Canyon north of Sylmar and east of Santa Clarita, and Mission, Rustic 
and Sullivan, a series of canyons forming a single dump site south of 
Mulholland Drive and west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five people asked to testify, including representatives for 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa 
Clarita), Simi Valley City Councilwoman Ann Rock and members of the North 
Valley Coalition, Mothers and Others Against Dumps, and the Santa Clarita 
Valley Canyons Preservation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Wright said: "I find it difficult to believe that the 
only environmentally sound locations in which to locate landfills in Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties occur along a 20-mile corridor roughly paralleling 
the 118 Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
One after another, speakers said the report failed to address the hazards of 
landfills in depth and ignored alternatives to urban trash dumps. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the four sites ranges from 125 million tons to 225 million tons 
of trash. The landfills could remain open from 20 to 50 years, depending on the 
rate of disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledged that the dumps would wipe out rustic wildlife habitat 
but said advanced waste-management techniques and careful planning could 
eliminate or reduce most of the noise, odor and truck traffic associated with 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released in August, was sponsored by the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts, which dispose of trash for 78 cities, and the county 
Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not rank the canyons in order of preference but suggested that 
at least three sites would have to become landfills to meet the county's 
growing demand for dump space. 
</P>
<P>
But political forces have already singled out Elsmere Canyon as a probable site 
if it passes strict environmental reviews.

<P>
It is a dance band with more saxophones than any other instrument, a band that 
accepts beginners but is mostly retired professional musicians, a group that 
includes a banjo player strumming along on all the big band favorites. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo Senior Band, newly formed and ready for its debut concert Sunday 
at the Camarillo Fiesta, accepts anybody who wants to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care what instruments show up. We've never told anybody they can't 
play with us," said bandleader John Herman at a recent rehearsal. The only 
stipulation is that the musician be at least 55 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The group was formed in August under the auspices of the Camarillo Senior 
Center and allows members to keep their musical skills fresh, said pianist Will 
Zens, as he searched for the music to "Stardust" on his piano. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the band's rendition of "Moonlight Serenade" provided a trip back in 
time as the melody echoed in the empty halls of a former officers' club at 
Camarillo Airport, where the group rehearses every Monday. KAREN McKEAN

Simi Valley City Council candidate Bruce Kanegai said Tuesday that he is 
dropping out of the race because of chronic back problems, narrowing the number 
of candidates vying for two council seats to eight. 
</P>
<P>
Kanegai, an art instructor at Simi Valley High School, said he decided to quit 
the race during the weekend when a two-year-old back injury flared up. 
</P>
<P>
Kanegai said he suffers from a compressed disc. 
</P>
<P>
Kanegai, 42, said he was concerned that his back problems would make it 
difficult for him to effectively serve on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Kanegai said he is endorsing candidate John Etter for the council because they 
share similar views on protecting the environment and controlling growth. 
Kanegai said he will probably make another run for the council in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining council candidates in the Nov. 6 election are Councilwoman Ann 
Rock, who is seeking her third term; Dave McCormick, a Simi Valley businessman; 
Judy Mikels, chairwoman of the city's Planning Commission; Kenneth Wenning, a 
Los Angeles attorney; Marilyn Maurer, a retired Los Angeles schoolteacher; 
Sandi Webb, a local businesswoman; and Harold Lawrence Fick, an administrative 
manager for General Motors; and Etter, a General Motors engineer. CARLOS V.

JORDAN RANCH BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through the Jordan Ranch project there is a good chance that we can get a lot 
of open space donated to the Santa Monica Mountains for public use if we act as 
responsible people instead of selfish people who have all they want. 
</P>
<P>
I have lived in the Conejo Valley for 20 years and have seen a lot of wonderful 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the growth has been less than acceptable. Through the years we have 
learned what is good and what is abused. The Jordan Ranch development is by far 
one of the best land uses I have seen. 
</P>
<P>
For the few people who think Bob Hope should give all his land to the Santa 
Monica Mountains, please think about giving away all of your land in the valley 
to them. I don't think that is a fair thing to ask. What he has offered is fair 
and we should act. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people opposed to this project have lived in our valley only a few 
years. The new houses that they live in would never have been built if we, the 
longtime residents, took the view that they are taking. Think about that, 
please. We all need to be fair to each other.

A long-awaited plan to limit future commercial projects on Ventura Boulevard 
was approved Tuesday by a key Los Angeles City Council panel, despite 
complaints from developers and homeowners that the plan was unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the council's Planning and 
Land Use Management Committee, predicted that the Ventura Boulevard specific 
plan will win final council approval. His committee approved the plan 3 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which limits the size of future high-rise office developments, would 
encourage construction of smaller buildings that would be more inviting to 
shoppers and pedestrians, Bernson predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kramer, a member of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., which had pushed 
for stronger building controls, said that although the plan is "a 
disappointment" in some aspects, it is preferable to no plan. He urged swift 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Murley, head of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., and Gerald 
A. Silver, head of Homeowners of Encino, attacked the several exemptions to the 
plan granted by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
One allows for construction of a 315,000-square-foot project by Goldrich-Kest 
Co. at Hayvenhurst Avenue and Ventura Boulevard. Another permits two 
medium-rise office towers to be built at Topanga Canyon and Ventura boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, an attorney for several major builders along Ventura 
Boulevard, complained that developers will race to put up projects to beat the 
plan's final cap on construction. 
</P>
<P>
He also opposed provisions that would bar new banks, restaurants and ice cream 
parlors along "great stretches" of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The plan limits future commercial growth to create no more than 30,000 new auto 
trips during afternoon rush hours. This would represent a 44% increase from the 
70,000 trips now generated by existing development. City officials have said 
the plan would allow a maximum of 8.6 million square feet of additional office 
and commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, future developers will be required to pay the city from $2,439 
to $4,038 for each new trip their project generates. Also assessed at the same 
rates will be projects built after Nov. 9, 1985, when an interim control law 
was approved by the council to limit growth while the plan was being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
The fees are projected to generate a $150-million traffic fund to add lanes to 
Ventura Boulevard. The planners have said the traffic improvements will ensure 
that the additional development will not aggravate the existing traffic 
congestion along the boulevard.

FARMERS TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST 'BIG GREEN' INITIATIVE IN SUBURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 200 Ventura County farm families are being organized this week for a 
door-to-door campaign in the San Fernando Valley as part of a statewide effort 
to block passage of the "Big Green" initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Farm Bureau and state organizers are recruiting Ventura farm 
families to join as many as 1,500 to 2,000 growers from Fresno to San Diego to 
walk door-to-door in the Valley on the weekend of Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Another group of 1,500 growers from Fresno north to the Oregon border will 
campaign against the ballot initiative in the San Francisco-area community of 
Concord Saturday, organizers added. 
</P>
<P>
While voters are told by the growers how they believe Proposition 128 will hurt 
the California and Ventura County agriculture industry, the growers will also 
be attempting to gain support for a counter initiative, Proposition 135. 
</P>
<P>
Called the "Careful" initiative, Proposition 135 would require increased 
testing for illegal pesticide residues on food, but would be far less 
restrictive on growers' practices than Proposition 128. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 would ban an estimated 350 potentially cancer-causing 
pesticides now used on food crops. Proposition 128 also contains several 
provisions unrelated to agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
If both measures pass and Proposition 135 passes by more votes than Proposition 
128, Proposition 135 provisions pertaining to agriculture would prevail and the 
rest of Proposition 128 would stand. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't understand what they are doing with Proposition 128," said 
Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "It's really 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
Laird said there are no alternative pest-control tools available to farmers for 
many of the chemicals that would be banned under Proposition 128. That could 
result in a substantial cost to area growers and knock them out of foreign 
markets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said growers agree that the agriculture industry must both reduce its use of 
chemicals on food crops and monitor water pollution from crop runoff more 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very clear direction toward less and less use of pesticides," he 
said. "The lack of speed on this is not reticence on the part of the growers, 
but the need to remain competitive in the global market place." 
</P>
<P>
Local supporters of Proposition 128 say the agriculture industry must be pushed 
into reducing its dependence on chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
They point to the success of Oxnard vegetable grower Dean Walsh, who 
organically farms 23 different row crops on 800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now achieving good, almost up to conventional standard yields in 
Ventura County," Walsh said. He depends on the shaping of the plant bed, soil 
tilling techniques, composting and crop rotation for much of his pest control 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 supporters have no war chest to sponsor massive precinct walks, 
said Marianne Sprinkel, an organic grower from Carpinteria. Sprinkel organized 
a "Big Green" party that drew about 35 people, and is considering setting up a 
second event for the Santa Barbara area. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole campaign for 128 is very grass-rootsy," she said. "We're hoping that 
at least three other people will throw parties for their friends, and they will 
throw parties for their friends."

COUNCIL WILL AMEND GENERAL PLAN TO ADD HOPE'S LAND; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY: THE CITY TAKES STEPS TOWARD ANNEXING THE PROPERTY. THE PROCESS OF 
ALTERING THE DOCUMENT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council has voted to authorize its staff to begin amending 
its General Plan to include Bob Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch, located in an 
unincorporated area south of the city. 
</P>
<P>
A General Plan amendment, which could take up to two years to complete, is 
necessary before the city can apply to annex Hope's property, where a 750-house 
development and tournament golf course are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Hope and Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option to buy the Jordan 
Ranch, have asked Simi Valley to annex the ranch property because of fears that 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors would reject the proposed subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody needs to take a look at this project," Mayor Greg Stratton said at 
the council meeting Monday night. "If nobody else is going to, then I think 
Simi Valley has an obligation to look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Glen McAdoo said the Hope proposal provided the city and the county 
with an opportunity to acquire and preserve thousands of acres of open space. 
If annexation and the Jordan Ranch development are approved, Hope has promised 
to sell and donate 5,700 acres in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains 
to park agencies for a below-market $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the council agreed with McAdoo and so did the majority of the more 
than 20 speakers who commented on the issue during a two-hour public hearing. A 
few speakers, however, argued that the Jordan Ranch project would have 
regionwide effects on air quality and traffic and that its fate should be 
decided by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Council members admitted that there are a number of obstacles that may 
ultimately prevent annexation of Jordan Ranch. But they stressed that the 
decision to go forward with a General Plan amendment would help determine if 
annexation is worth pursuing. It would not commit the city to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Although she said she supported the city's decision to pursue a General Plan 
amendment, Councilwoman Vicky Howard said she felt that there was little chance 
the Local Agency Formation Commission would allow the city to annex the Hope 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who is a member of LAFCO, said the main reason the commission would 
probably reject the annexation proposal is that the Jordan Ranch subdivision 
does not follow Ventura County's Guidelines for Orderly Development, which 
requires development to be clustered in or near cities. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said Simi Valley is separated from the ranch site by a mountain range 
that would make it difficult to provide some city services to the area. 
</P>
<P>
But she said it is possible that those problems could be worked out and that 
the Hope proposal deserves further study. 
</P>
<P>
The city has asked LAFCO for an early ruling on the annexation proposal, and 
the panel is scheduled to hear the matter today. However, LAFCO Director Bob 
Braitman has said he will ask the commission to delay any decision until Nov. 
21.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient was convicted Tuesday of 53 charges in connection with the 
"walk-to-the-back" robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bresney, 39, was acquitted of one robbery count and had two other charges 
dismissed after a San Diego Superior Court jury deadlocked 11n to 1 on them. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek said Bresney could be given a maximum of 62 
years, 4 months in state prison when he is sentenced Nov. 20 by Judge David 
Gill. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery series was dubbed "walk to the back" by police because the gunman 
often told employees of small businesses to go to the back of the store while 
he rifled the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly small stores throughout the county were hit in the series, which began 
Dec. 11, 1988, and ended with Bresney's arrest in North Park in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, which began deliberations Oct. 9, found Bresney guilty of committing 
51 hold-ups and of attempting to rob two stores in which a safe could not be 
opened.

TAPE OF INTERVIEW DESCRIBES MURDERER'S THREATS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIALS: A VICTIM TOLD POLICE HOURS AFTER BEING SHOT THAT A DRIFTER SAID HE'D 
KILL THE DEFENDANT IF SHE DIDN'T HELP HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a tape-recorded interview played in court Tuesday, a Chatsworth girl told 
police hours after being shot by a drifter, who fatally shot her best friend, 
that the assailant threatened to kill his alleged accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
The statement is crucial to the defense in the trial of Marsha Lynn Ramos, 36, 
who is accused of luring two girls into a camper, where drifter Roland Norman 
Comtois tied and gagged them and sexually molested the girl, who was 13 at the 
time. He killed Wendy Masuhara, 14, the survivor's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen is expected to rule in the 
next several days whether portions of the interview, taped Sept. 19, 1987, can 
be admitted into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that most of the statements appeared to be inadmissible because 
the girl has said in court that she no longer remembers anything about the 
interview. The tape was played outside the presence of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was interviewed by police on tape from her hospital bed at Humana 
Hospital-West Hills about three hours after the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Coen sentenced Comtois, 60, to die in the gas chamber after a jury 
convicted him of murder, attempted murder, attempted sodomy, kidnaping and 
other charges. Ramos faces the same sentence if convicted of similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
The girl said Ramos approached her and her friend and lured them into the 
camper by asking them to help start the vehicle, which Ramos said had stalled. 
</P>
<P>
In the taped interview, Los Angeles Police Detective Sandy Palmer asked the 
girl: "Did you ever hear him threaten her that if she didn't help him, he would 
kill her?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the girl replied. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the interview, Palmer asked: "Did she ever ask him not to hurt 
anybody?" The girl responded, "I think." 
</P>
<P>
In the taped statement, the girl said that as Ramos injected with her with 
cocaine at Comtois' request, Ramos told her "that she had to because he would 
get mad otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
The girl testified Tuesday that she could not remember the interview because "I 
had just been shot and had been given a shot of cocaine and I wasn't really 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
The girl, now 16, survived because her upraised hand deflected a bullet from 
Comtois' gun. Seconds earlier, Comtois fatally shot Masuhara in the head after 
placing the two girls in an abandoned station wagon in remote Woolsey Canyon, 
near the Chatsworth Reservoir.

TRAINING FOR WELFARE MOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are pleased that The Times reported on an important new study on training 
welfare mothers for work (Part A, Sept. 20). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the headline, "Basic Education Found to Be Job Path for Poor," 
is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the study showed that only when basic education was integrated into 
specific job skill training was the program truly successful. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the states must begin to implement new programs to shift 
welfare mothers to self-sufficiency under the Family Support Act, the article 
was right on target when it said that one of the purposes of the study is to 
"prompt state officials to consider alternatives to the traditional 
school-first work-training programs." 
</P>
<P>
This is wonderful opportunity to try on a much broader scale the model for 
training welfare mothers for work we find so promising.

SHUTDOWN AGAIN? FORGET ABOUT IT; 
</P>
<P>
IDEOLOGY, NOT COMPROMISE, IS ENEMY OF PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There they go again. Congress, still a house divided on the budget, and the 
President, still threatening to shut down the federal government again at 
week's end if a budget accord isn't reached. When will it end? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not before the November congressional elections, sad to say. 
</P>
<P>
Shutting down Washington a weekend ago may have narrowed the political gap 
between President Bush and Congress over how to cut the federal deficit. And it 
certainly got everyone's attention. But the gap actually widened again Tuesday, 
despite White House hints that Bush would veto a new Democratic budget plan. So 
even his own party's leaders in Congress think he should forget about closing 
down the federal government again. The joke's growing stale -- and the trick 
just isn't going to work. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROBLEM: The urgency of hammering the deficit down by $40 billion in the 
next budget remains. That is still Congress' job. A poll last week suggested 
that by about 2 to 1, people thought Congress would do better at cutting the 
deficit than Bush. Four months of summit meetings between Congress and the 
White House have at least settled the question of whether deficits can be cut 
deeply enough without a combination of higher taxes and lower spending. They 
cannot. 
</P>
<P>
Congress rejected the summit version of a budget because the mix of tax 
increases and spending cuts did not suit the members, and they've been 
searching for a new mix ever since. But if Congress misses the new Friday 
deadline for a budget Bush can live with, its failure will involve ideologies 
and politics so rigid that leaving federal government at half-mast into next 
month probably would not budge anyone much. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, a citizen's lobby in Washington, is right about one thing. 
Because campaign financing laws tilt so far in their favor, incumbents leave 
only when they die or get a better job offer. But for most members Congress 
becomes such a career that their fear of offending voters and losing their jobs 
borders on paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
THE SOLUTION: For House Republicans, the greatest fear lies in raising taxes, 
so they put together their own budget of spending cuts without tax increases 
Tuesday. It fell one-third short of its deficit target and did not make it to a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic paranoia stems from cuts in spending for social programs, increases 
in Medicare premiums and tax increases that fall more heavily on middle-income 
Americans than on the wealthy. They, too, put together a package, and while 
they have the numbers to pass it despite their Republican colleagues' 
objections, they may not have enough votes to get it past Bush's putative veto. 
</P>
<P>
But for Washington to get a budget before election day, it must split the 
difference between Tuesday's diverse approaches. As we've argued before, a 
practical budget deal will involve some give on both sides of the aisle -- 
Republicans will have to accept new taxes and Democrats will have to give Bush 
and the GOP a capital gains tax cut, or some such concession that they require.

REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oct. 2 will go down as a historic day in European history. Germany has become 
one nation from two. Unlike the trends in other nations in Europe, Germany will 
have one nation with two different economies. 
</P>
<P>
The East will remain for the near future a poor sister in the new family. 
</P>
<P>
As we see in other nations such as Yugoslavia, the poor states strive for a 
better piece of the pie or even independence from the more prosperous states. 
Bosnians and Macedonians have a much tougher time than their fellow Yugoslavs, 
the Serbians, Croatians and Slovenes. The union forged by Tito is close to 
breaking down. The Soviet Union is feeling the pressure of secession from 
several states (referred to as "republics"). Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia 
recently were permitted to issue their own postage stamps for the first time in 
a half-century -- one of the first steps in independence from the mother 
country. Ethnic minorities in Soviet Asia are struggling for more autonomy if 
not total independence. 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell if the old East Germany will be the second-class part of 
the union or eventually catch up to the West and become an equal partner in the 
new 4th Republic of Germany. And judging from the blinding speed which led one 
event to another to this day, the time may be shorter than expected.

REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Germany Needs to Face This Honestly" (editorial, Oct. 5): 
</P>
<P>
Newly unified Germany is an easy target for potshots these days. In addition to 
already existing nervousness about its past, the (German Economics Minister 
Helmut) Haussmann report has brought to light recent involvement in supplying 
Iraq with materials or aid for the production of chemical, biological and 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial also points an accusing finger at France and the Soviet Union. 
Our own contributions to international armament and greed are written off 
lamely with, "Americans may also have helped." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Germany's actions in this area are reprehensible. But when did our own 
greed become more ethical than Germany's? America's capacity to condemn others 
from a position of moral outrage while maintaining a marvelous amnesia 
concerning our own past actions is one of our most grievous national 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Honesty? Greed? Physician, heal thyself!

PROPOSITION 142; 
</P>
<P>
HELPING VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 142 on the Nov. 6 ballot, the Veterans' Bond Act of 1990, can be 
unreservedly recommended. Continuing a remarkably successful program that first 
began in 1921, Proposition 142 authorizes a $400-million bond issue to finance 
the Cal-Vet program of home and farm purchases by veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 69 years California voters have approved 23 veterans' bond issues 
totaling about $7.1 billion. Throughout its long history, Cal-Vet has been 
entirely self-supporting. There has been no direct cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Money raised by the sales of Cal-Vet bonds is used by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to buy homes, farms and mobile homes for resale to qualifying 
veterans. The state, because of its heavy participation in financial markets, 
is able to borrow money at interest rates considerably below those charged 
individuals. These advantageous rates are passed along to Cal-Vet program 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly payments made by participating veterans to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs cover all principal, interest and operating costs. Besides directly 
benefiting veterans and their families, Cal-Vet contributes to the larger state 
economy by generating jobs in the construction industry and promoting economic 
activity in those trades and professions that serve the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
More than 392,000 California veterans have been able to finance homes and farms 
under the Cal-Vet program. The 1990 Veterans' Bond Act will open the housing 
market to thousands of additional veterans. We urge a yes vote on Proposition 
142.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The labor organization that represents the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department accused sheriff's candidate Jim Roache Tuesday of trying to 
discredit its membership. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter signed by nine of its officers, the Deputy Sheriff's Assn. asked 
Roache, a sheriff's captain, to stop asserting that his opponent, Assistant 
Sheriff Jack Drown, coerced members into supporting Drown for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Drown and Roache are running to succeed Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
In a vote taken earlier this year, 96% of the DSA membership endorsed Drown 
over Roache. 
</P>
<P>
The DSA officers said that Roache has tried to intimidate the membership into 
voting for Roache and has unfairly suggested that the DSA is part of a "corrupt 
political machine attempting to unlawfully influence the election." 
</P>
<P>
Roache denied those contentions Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"When Duffy decided not to seek reelection and hand-picked Jack Drown to run 
for sheriff, Drown intensely lobbied DSA for their endorsement and had them 
believe that Duffy was going to help Drown win through his political clout," 
Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not intimidated anyone. I have not tried to discredit the DSA. I'm a 
member, and they represent my interests as well."

REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it odd that in The Times' excellent coverage of the German reunification 
celebrations (Oct. 3) there is no mention of Ronald Reagan's cry, "Mr. 
Gorbachev, tear down this wall." 
</P>
<P>
I believe that cry had something to do with triggering the landslide that 
helped dislodge the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And how ironic it is that Reagan was recently cheered in Berlin and Poland and 
warmly greeted in Moscow, while in his own country little note is made. Except 
in the cartoons of Conrad who ("A combination of factors brought these deficits 
about!" Oct. 3), again claims that the cause of all America's ills is one 
Ronald Reagan.

As a Vietnam-era veteran, I can appreciate the bad times Rummel and his family 
suffered due to Germany's initiation of World War II. But the experiences he 
shared in his commentary are words of a man whose country lost a war. I wonder 
what Rummel would have written on Oct. 3, 1990, if Germany had claimed victory 
in 1945! I say let Germany earn the trust of our democracy.

JOHN METZGER SAYS HE SPOKE TO KILLER IN PORTLAND CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PORTLAND, Ore.

<TEXT>
<P>
A white supremacist leader testified Tuesday that he spoke to neo-Nazi 
"skinhead" Kenneth Mieske several weeks before Mieske beat a black man to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
John Metzger was on the witness stand for a second day of questioning in the 
$10-million lawsuit brought against him and his father, Tom Metzger, by the 
victim's family. The lawsuit alleges that the Metzgers incited the murder by 
sending agents to Portland to provoke violence. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Metzger, 52, of Fallbrook, Calif., is a former Ku Klux Klan leader who 
founded the White Aryan Resistance. John Metzger, 22, is head of a spinoff 
group, the Aryan Youth Movement. 
</P>
<P>
John Metzger said Tuesday that he called a group of white racists in Portland 
on Oct. 25, 1988. The phone was passed to Mieske, who was convicted in the 
death of Mulugeta Seraw the following Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger provided few details about his conversation with Mieske or about a 
conversation with Dave Mazzella. Mazzella is former vice president of the White 
Aryan Resistance and a star witness for the plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger acknowledged that he spoke to Mazzella a day after the murder but two 
days before Mazzella made a statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
"What did he say about the murder and what did you tell him?" asked Morris 
Dees, an attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the groups that 
is representing the Seraw family. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall. I have no idea what the call was about," Metzger testified. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Metzger testified that skinheads earned a deadly reputation after 
the murder of Seraw, but he said he wasn't referring to the fatal beating. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a reputation that, when they're attacked, they're going to fight 
back -- in self-defense," Metzger testified. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that he told the Seattle Times that "skinheads these days are 
deadlier than just two years ago. They're more disciplined -- more kosher, if 
you will." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger was quoted in a Seattle Times article that appeared Dec. 3, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said Monday that he meant to say that skinheads were no longer being 
picked on or attacked by those who disagreed with their views on race. 
</P>
<P>
"They were more deadly to the people who oppose them," Metzger testified. 
</P>
<P>
He said he counseled skinheads to put up "more of a combined opposition to the 
crap that was being thrown at them." 
</P>
<P>
He said he urged skinheads to fight back strongly if they were attacked by 
other gangs.

CRUISE CONTROL;

<P>
HAWTHORNE TRIES TO DRIVE YOUTHS OUT OF TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hawthorne Police Sgt. Robert Cooper first heard that cruisers were once 
again gathering along Hawthorne Boulevard, he was decidedly reluctant to crack 
down on their fun. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, he used to cruise with the best of them along the same street 
made famous by the Beach Boys -- to see the hot rods, to race cars and to pick 
up girls. Remembering the old A &amp; W root beer stand, where cruisers once 
gathered, and the Wichstand, a drive-in restaurant where his friends later 
would meet, the veteran police officer felt nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
After a gang-related shooting in Lawndale during cruising hours last month, he 
decided that the innocent amusement of his youth had become too dangerous to go 
unchecked. Cooper, a supervisor in the traffic division, now sends extra patrol 
officers to Hawthorne Boulevard on cruising nights in an attempt to drive the 
cruisers out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"The people coming around, probably 90% of them are just regular ol' kids not 
really out to do much of anything," Cooper said. "But the city just can't let 
it go on and let all those folks who like to shoot up the town come in and have 
target practice. We're kind of in the situation that if we don't go out and 
discourage them, violence will escalate." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's cruising revival began about two months ago when several hundred 
cruisers from as far away as Whittier and the San Fernando Valley suddenly 
rediscovered Hawthorne Boulevard. Many of them came in response to a crackdown 
in Redondo Beach, where police have been enforcing ordinances against loud 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Staehler, 18, of Torrance said he and other members of the Rollerz Only 
car and truck club deserve credit for the revival. Two months ago, Rollerz Only 
members handed out about 10,000 flyers that named Hawthorne Boulevard as the 
new cruising hot spot on Tuesday nights, Staehler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the idea from our parents because they said they used to cruise 
Hawthorne back in the '60s when they had their little race cars," Staehler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cruisers usually meet about 8 p.m. at the Burger King on Hawthorne 
Boulevard at Rosecrans Avenue before driving to Carl's Jr. or 7-Eleven. They 
rarely race, but almost always blare rap music from their cars, Staehler said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, police said, the cruising appeared harmless. Although the extra cars 
caused some gridlock problems, "We thought, what the heck, the kids have to 
have something to do and some place to go so we're not going to lose sleep over 
it," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few weeks the complaints became more serious, and it became clear that 
gang members were also showing up for the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions erupted last month when a suspected gang member was shot during a 
brawl in the parking lot of a restaurant on Hawthorne Boulevard. The victim is 
recovering from his wounds. Prosecutors have decided that his attacker was 
acting in self-defense and will not press charges, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Sgt. Michael Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent clashes between gang members and cruisers, and to ensure that no 
bystanders are caught in the cross-fire, police and gang counselors have 
started to discourage cruisers from coming into the city. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, police have been enforcing traffic laws and issuing 
citations to cruisers whose cars are too low. Cars cited more than once for 
unsafe driving conditions have been towed away, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the potential dangers, Staehler said members of his club are determined 
to keep cruising, and they plan to distribute more flyers. Law enforcement 
officials said they hate to put a damper on the cruisers' fun but the hazards 
of gang activity leave them with no choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not good, clean fun anymore," Cooper said. "While most of the people 
view it that way, we have enough of the undesirable element that thinks, 'Hey, 
let's go shoot 'em up.' Unfortunately, everyone is going to have to suffer 
because we don't need a bunch of dead kids in our city."

TRIAL OF NAVY PETTY OFFICER ACCUSED OF MURDER BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors heard opening arguments Tuesday in the murder trial of Robert William 
Nydegger, a Navy petty officer charged with killing his roommate and stuffing 
the body into a refrigerator in the back yard of their Imperial Beach house. 
</P>
<P>
Nydegger, 43, is charged with murdering 39-year-old Timothy Cudd with a lethal 
dose of the antihistamine known in its over-the-counter form as Benadryl. 
</P>
<P>
Nydegger is also charged with four counts of forgery stemming from the alleged 
use of four of Cudd's checks. He is accused of passing or attempting to pass 
checks worth $3,431. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement to the jury, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Amador outlined 
the circumstantial evidence -- including Nydegger's apparent attempted suicide 
with Benadryl and the discovery of Cudd's checkbook in Nydegger's desk -- which 
he said point to Nydegger's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Charles Bumer insisted during his opening statement that 
Cudd's death was a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Cudd was afflicted with Huntington's chorea, a debilitating nerve disorder that 
had begun to affect his movement. Bumer also said that Cudd was suffering from 
the same psychiatric disorder affecting Nydegger -- post-trauma stress 
syndrome, a condition Bumer said resulted from their service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Bumer admitted that Nydegger "may have behaved strangely" or in an "irrational" 
manner by attempting to hide the body, but contended that was because of his 
own mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last about four weeks.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES;

<P>
LAGUNA CANYON ISN'T RESCUED YET; 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH VOTERS WILL DO THEIR PART BY PASSING A BOND MEASURE, BUT THE AREA 
BELONGS TO ALL ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS, AND THEIR HELP WILL BE NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIDA LENNEY, Lida Lenney is mayor of Laguna Beach and the founder of the 
Laguna Canyon Conservancy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Everywhere the white man has touched the earth, it is sore." The words of a 
holy old Wintu woman reverberated in my mind a few days ago as I drove down the 
hill in the bright blue sun of October. I was wondering how to communicate the 
value of preserving Laguna Canyon as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, unbelievably, a deer ran down the road ahead of me, its hooves 
striking the hard macadam, its knobby legs bouncing gingerly. The deer turned 
into a side street leading to a lush arroyo and disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
You see, some of the recent headlines have been misleading. Laguna Canyon isn't 
saved yet. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Laguna Beach has reached a historic agreement with the Irvine Co. 
to buy the Laguna Laurel area of the canyon, which is scheduled for residential 
and commercial development, for $78 million. The first payment of $33 million 
is due June 30, 1991. The payment plan stretches over five years with $3 
million due in 1992, $4 million in 1993, $5 million in 1994 and a balloon 
payment of $33 million in 1995. No interest will be charged, but each payment 
after the first is subject to a consumer price index adjustment capped at 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach voters will be the first to have their say. On Nov. 6, they will 
vote up or down on Measure H, the $20-million, 20-year general obligation bond 
proposal that will be the crucial first step in the purchase of the canyon 
land. It will cost the average homeowner an average of $59 a year for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
More than merely providing the $20 million, approval of Measure H is also the 
prerequisite for funding from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
I am confident Measure H will win. Some people will vote yes out of love for 
Laguna Canyon, pure and simple. Others will vote yes because it means 36,000 
fewer car trips per day on Laguna Canyon Road, or because such irreplaceable 
open space will improve the quality of life, and, oh yes, property values. 
</P>
<P>
But how can a city of 25,000 people with an annual budget of $25 million take 
on a $78-million obligation? With faith, hope and help from our friends. In the 
immortal words of Yogi Berra, "What we have before us is an insurmountable 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
This is not just Laguna's canyon. Laguna Canyon belongs to the people of Orange 
County and the people of California just as surely as it belonged to the 
Gabrieleno Indians long before Spanish land grants. Just as surely as it 
belonged to that holy, old Wintu woman. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Orange County feel ownership in the canyon. In a poll last June, 
55% said they would tax themselves to buy Laguna Canyon. Knowing this, the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors endorsed the acquisition program, allocating 
$2 million a year for the next five years from funds available only for the 
purchase of open space. The parks division has agreed to supervise the area as 
a regional wilderness park. 
</P>
<P>
An important part of the purchase agreement is the commitment of the city, the 
county, the Irvine Co. and members of the Laguna Laurel Advisory Group to work 
together to secure state, federal and private funding. With such a team, how 
can we lose? 
</P>
<P>
We will be looking for funding from the recently passed mountain lion 
initiative and cigarette tax. We encourage a yes vote on state Proposition 149, 
the California Park, Recreation and Wildlife Enhancement Act of 1990. And we 
look to the people of Orange County and others to contribute as private 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
What will you and I get for our money? We will have access to the land, a 
wilderness park that preserves our natural heritage and the wildlife habitat. 
The sandstone caves, lakes, hundred-years-old oaks and sycamores, and lush 
canyons will be accessible on roads that already exist. We will be able to get 
away from it all without driving to Mammoth or Yosemite. We will buy cleaner 
air and the freedom from 36,000 additional cars per day on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all we will know that we left a legacy for our children and all who 
come after -- a priceless heritage. The deer born in Laguna Canyon in the 
future will not have to pound the pavement in their search for food.

SOCKER MANAGEMENT, COACHES TRY TO PATCH THEIR DIFFERENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers' owner and president got together with the team's coaching staff 
for three hours Tuesday evening and tried to mend a rift that developed over 
how three remaining roster spots would be filled. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently solved was a difference of opinion between Coach Ron Newman and 
President Ron Cady over whether to sign free-agent midfielder Paul Dougherty. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said decisions were made during the meeting as to whom will be offered 
contracts for the final spots, but would not say whether Dougherty was among 
them. He said details would be announced at a press conference today at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cady and and owner Ron Fowler also took exception to a story that appeared in 
Tuesday's San Diego Edition of The Times that quoted two team sources who 
contended there has been a split between management and Newman for a couple 
years. The sources also said that disagreements between Cady and Newman have 
been so strong that Cady would like to get rid of Newman but can't because the 
team keeps winning championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the stuff was as fallacious as I've ever seen," Fowler said. "I think 
it's a case in which people who don't know everything that is going on put two 
and two together and come up with seven. It's complete bull----. When other 
people speculate on matters they know nothing of they come across as complete 
Bozos and I think that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Added Cady, "Why would we want to get rid of someone who has won eight 
championships?" 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said disagreements have cropped up between Cady and Newman, but that he 
has never seen "a situation where two professionals don't at some point 
differ." 
</P>
<P>
Cady waffled as to whether he has had disagreements with Newman. At one point 
Cady said he has had "normal" differences with Newman. 
</P>
<P>
"I call them normal differences in managing a professional team," he said. "I 
call them normal differences in running a business." 
</P>
<P>
Those differences apparently reached a boil earlier this week and a meeting was 
held Monday night to discus the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a meeting just to air some differences that we've been having over some 
time here," Cady said. "It was just a little hiccup in Newman and my 
relationship and I think we got it all aired out." 
</P>
<P>
Later Cady said he has never disagreed on a personnel matter with Newman in the 
three years he has been club president. 
</P>
<P>
"For the three years we (Fowler and Cady) have been running the club," Cady 
said, "Coach Newman and I have always agreed on every single roster member." 
</P>
<P>
The Dougherty situation appears to be another personnel matter wherein Cady and 
Newman have disagreed. On Monday Newman made it clear he wanted Dougherty for 
the team but that the decision was not his. 
</P>
<P>
When Fowler was asked about the Dougherty situation on Tuesday, the owner did 
not deny that a rift existed between Newman and Cady, but said he casts the 
deciding vote when such a difference occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy who writes the check gets to make the final decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cady also took exception to what he saw as an underlying tone of the quotes in 
Tuesday's story which suggested that the Sockers have won three championships 
under the Cady-Fowler regime in spite of the two. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been involved with and have run the club the same way for three 
years," Cady said. "And my relationship with Newman has been the same for three 
years. If they're saying that the team has won in spite of the way we have 
managed the club, I would have to disagree."

COCAINE ALLEGATION DENIED BY HOLIEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: HIS FORMER ROOMMATE AT OKLAHOMA TESTIFIES THAT THE TWO USED THE DRUG 
WHILE IN COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Thompson, former University of Oklahoma quarterback serving a two-year 
sentence for selling cocaine, testified this week in Oklahoma federal court 
that he, Jamelle Holieway and other members of the Sooner football team used 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also said then-coach Barry Switzer suspected the Sooner players were 
taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was testifying in the trial of John Green and Lamont Harris, former 
Oklahoma athletes accused of supplying Thompson with cocaine in January of 
1989. Thompson sold the drugs to an undercover FBI agent, which resulted in his 
arrest and later conviction. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's and Tuesday's testimony, Thompson said he and his roommate, 
Holieway, the 1984 Los Angeles City high school player of the year, used 
cocaine several times together. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times Tuesday, Holieway denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not true," he said. "I didn't do cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway, a star at Banning High in Wilmington, started for much of his 
four-year career at Oklahoma. As a freshman, the option quarterback led the 
Sooners to a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway is an assistant coach in charge of running backs and quarterbacks at 
Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway, who failed to gain a place on the roster of the British Columbia 
Lions of the Canadian Football League last summer, said he tested positive for 
marijuana in a drug test administered by Oklahoma athletic officials. Holieway 
said he was at a party where a marijuana cigarette was being passed and he took 
some puffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was that," he said. "The next day I had a drug test." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also targeted Holieway in his book, "Down and Dirty: The Life and 
Times of Oklahoma Football." 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, my name is bigger than his, so he brought me into it," 
Holieway said. "It's a whole big publicity thing to sell the book. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ruining my life. It's giving my family a bad reputation. If you're down 
and out, why bring everyone else into it?" 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said he had talked to Thompson once since Thompson entered prison in 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"In jail, he was telling me how the book was going, but that was over a year 
ago," Holieway said. "What he's done has caught me off guard. It's wrong to go 
out and belittle another man for money." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said the Long Beach City College players have discussed the situation 
with him. "When they asked me, basically it was hard to sit there and say no," 
Holieway said. "All I told them was don't get caught up in that scene like I 
did. But I learned from it." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said that although he was close with Thompson on the field, they did 
not have the same friends. He said he did not see Thompson use cocaine while 
they were roommates. But he said many Oklahoma players would attend parties 
with fraternity schoolmates where cocaine, pills and other drugs were present. 
</P>
<P>
After testing positive for marijuana, Holieway said he abstained from taking 
drugs, but drank alcohol at those parties. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said he is concerned about the repercussions over the latest episode 
at Oklahoma. "I don't believe I did anything wrong, but how will people look at 
me now?" he asked. "How can I speak? What about when I go for a job interview?" 
</P>
<P>
Thompson testified that Switzer ordered him and Holieway to undergo drug tests 
in the spring of 1988. Thompson said Switzer went to their apartment and 
ordered them to take the test when they at first failed to appear for the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he was ordered to undergo a five-day rehabilitation program after 
testing positive three times in the spring and summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that after his arrest, Holieway expressed concern about his name 
surfacing. In an interview last year, Holieway said he contacted Thompson to 
offer support. Holieway denied at the time that he was involved in Thompson's 
situation.

LAKERS DOWN MACCABI AS TEAGLE WARMS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a break from their usual exhibition fare, the Lakers bumped aside 
Maccabi Tel Aviv Tuesday night, 129-106, before a crowd of 17,505 at the Forum, 
but they had to stay awake later than was expected. 
</P>
<P>
Maccabi was within 90-83 early in the fourth quarter before the Lakers went 
off, sparked by Terry Teagle. 
</P>
<P>
Teagle, three for 25 in exhibition games until then, made seven of eight shots 
in the fourthquarter and finished with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, there may not be great practical application for the winners, 
since Maccabi sank back in a zone defense for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Royal of Maccabi scored 33 points, making 17 of 18 free throws, and 
teammate Ed Horton had 25 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy added 20 points and nine rebounds for the Lakers, Byron Scott had 
17 points, Sam Perkins had 16 points and eight rebounds, Magic Johnson had 14 
points and 10 assists, and A.C. Green had 12 points to go with 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers announced before the game they have signed 6-8 forward Irving 
Thomas, a rookie from Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was impressive for the Lakers' summer league team, signed with a team in 
Greece, but recently returned. He is given a good chance to make the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas averaged 17.1 points and 8.8 rebounds during the Lakers' 10-game 
summer-league season. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Florida State, Thomas averaged 16.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per 
game.

BOWMAN SKATES FACING NEW CAREER DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During practice sessions for the Skate America competition this week in 
Buffalo, N.Y., Christopher Bowman expects to be confronted with a moment of 
indecision. Should he skate to the sideboards to seek advice from Frank 
Carroll, his coach of 17 years, or from Toller Cranston, who has been coaching 
Bowman for little more than a month? 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be bizarre in the warm-ups," Bowman said last week. "I'll go 
into overdrive and then forget which coach to go over to." 
</P>
<P>
If he makes the wrong choice, Carroll no doubt will remind him. He never has 
been shy about telling Bowman anything. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Bowman ended a professional relationship that began at the 
Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank when he was 6 years old. By almost anyone else's 
standards, the partnership was successful. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, from Van Nuys, earned a place on the U.S. Olympic team for the 1988 
Winter Games, won the national championship in 1989 and, in that same year, 
finished second at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But Carroll, who formerly coached Olympic silver medalist Linda Fratianne, 
often complained that Bowman would not reach his potential until his work 
habits improved. They had a falling out at last winter's World Championships, 
where Bowman won the bronze medal. Their last competition together was last 
summer's Goodwill Games, where a winded Bowman finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
They decided that Bowman needed a change, which led him to Toronto and 
Cranston, the 1976 Olympic bronze medalist for Canada. Their initial test 
together will begin Thursday at Skate America, one of the first international 
competitions of the new season. 
</P>
<P>
It should be among the best competitions of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank and I will always be friends," Bowman said. "He's been like a third 
parent to me. We love each other, and, at the same time, we hate each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having to work for your father. You love him to death, but the 
business isn't going right and tension builds up in the house first. One of you 
has to pull back. It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman has been working out three times a day in Toronto. He spends much of his 
practice time with Ellen Burka, who had a reputation as a taskmaster when she 
coached Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been trying hard," Burka said. "I make him go through his programs, but I 
can't change a 23-year-old established male skater as far as the way he works 
(is concerned). He works his own way, and he thinks he's working very hard 
right now."

Eric Dickerson's first hit in practice was a "stunner," but he said there was 
no tension or bitterness from teammates he once trashed. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, who spent the past six weeks on the NFL's non-football injured list, 
rejoined the Indianapolis Colts for practice for the first time since last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous at all," he said. "Everyone thinks I have all these 
enemies.... There are three or four guys I don't get along with, but there's 45 
or so others." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Jack Trudeau: "Everybody will put it behind them and give Eric 
a chance to make up for the things that happened. If he plays well, he can 
certainly help us."

Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson and Chicago's Michael B. McCaskey said in Chicago 
that the league should take a long, hard look at adding new franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably not one of the pro-expansion owners, but if there are some good

Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has said he would like two more teams by 1993 and 
two more in 1995.

Mike Lynn, the president of a proposed world football league, said play will 
begin in March even though no cities, coaches or players have been announced. 
He added that he hoped that Canton, Ohio, where the NFL was founded, would seek 
to join the world league.

The Phoenix Cardinals traded injury-prone defensive end David Galloway, who has 
played only 24 regular-season games the last four seasons, to the Denver 
Broncos for an undisclosed draft pick. . . . Cardinal guard Lance Smith was 
arrested in connection with a domestic dispute but is expected to play Sunday

ERVINS RETURNS, BUT ROYSTER PLAYS

<P>
Tailback Ricky Ervins returned to practice Monday for the first time since 
spraining his left ankle on Sept. 29 against Ohio State, but sophomore Mazio 
Royster is expected to start against Arizona Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"His status is still unknown," Coach Larry Smith said of Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's moved from possible to probable. (But) Mazio, as long as he's 
healthy, will start. Ricky, hopefully, will be ready to play. And if he is, he 
definitely will play some." 
</P>
<P>
Freshmen Willie McGinest, Jason Oliver and Michael Jones will remain on the 
team, Smith said, pending the outcome of criminal procedures. The three face 
misdemeanor charges in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a 
23-year-old female graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you suspend a person, you're saying they're guilty," Smith said. "I 
don't think we can do that. We're not a judge and jury. It's best to let the 
courts handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if USC is recruiting Corby Smith, his son and the starting quarterback at 
Loyola High School, Smith said: "You'll have to talk to his mother." JERRY

NO ROSES MAY LAND USC A HOLIDAY PLUM; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS: DESPITE LOSS TO WASHINGTON, SMITH'S TEAM DRAWS INTEREST FROM SUGAR, 
CITRUS AND ORANGE BOWLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Washington beat Oregon Saturday, it dealt another blow to USC's 
diminishing chances of reaching the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't worry about that," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "We had our chance (to 
beat Washington) and didn't do it, so they've got their season and we've got 
ours. We'll just go about our way." 
</P>
<P>
It might not be so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through an unpredictable season, USC finds itself in a unique position: 
Unless Washington falters twice in its last five games, the Trojans won't make 
a fourth consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl, but they could still spend New 
Year's Day playing for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
They are 5-1 and, a 31-0 loss to Washington notwithstanding, figure to be 
favored in their remaining six games, including their season finale against 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
And wouldn't, say, the Citrus Bowl love to match a once-beaten USC team -- 
featuring Todd Marinovich, perhaps the nation's best known quarterback -- 
against an unbeaten Virginia team? 
</P>
<P>
"We've looked at that," said Chuck Rohe, executive director of the Citrus Bowl. 
"There are some really good possibilities out there, and that's certainly one 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
Or wouldn't, say, the Orange Bowl like to match a once-beaten USC team against 
an unbeaten Nebraska team? 
</P>
<P>
"We're very cognizant of that situation (in the Pacific 10 Conference), and any 
time you think of (landing) Southern Cal, it's exciting," said Steven Hatchell, 
executive director of the Orange Bowl. "We haven't sent anybody to any of their 
games, but we sure have talked about them." 
</P>
<P>
How about USC against an unbeaten Southeastern Conference opponent, Auburn or 
Tennessee, in the Sugar Bowl? Two years ago, the Trojans were set to play in 
the Sugar Bowl before they beat UCLA to land a Rose Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely interested in a Pac-10 team," said Troy Mathieu, assistant 
executive director of the Sugar Bowl. "We have looked at USC and talked about 
them and they are high on our list." 
</P>
<P>
Washington set a precedent for such a chain of events in 1984, when the 
Huskies' bid for a perfect season and a Rose Bowl bid were ended by a 16-7 loss 
to USC. They recovered to beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, winding up 11-1 and 
finishing second to Brigham Young in the final polls. 
</P>
<P>
Is USC that good? 
</P>
<P>
"They're as good as any team I've seen (this season)," said Dick Vermeil, 
former coach of UCLA and the Philadelphia Eagles and a commentator for ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what I saw in study of their game tapes from Washington State and 
based on what I saw Saturday (in a 37-22 victory over Stanford), there aren't 
many teams in the country that are better. I don't know who the best team is, 
but they've got to be in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich ranks second in the Pac-10 in passing efficiency after throwing for 
a career-high 338 yards against Stanford. Gary Wellman, who caught seven passes 
for 194 yards and two touchdowns against the Cardinal, ranks second in the 
conference in receiving yardage, and the Trojans' ground game has produced 
263.7 yards a game in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"They can score from anywhere on the field, and maybe select the guy they want 
to do it with," Vermeil said. "It's not any one guy. (Wellman) was so explosive 
the other day, but the impressive thing is, when they get a guy open for a big 
play, Marinovich gets (the ball) there. 
</P>
<P>
"Their offensive line is so impressive. I think it's improving. I know (tackle 
Pat) Harlow had a slow start, but now he's coming on strong. They lost (tight 
end Frank) Griffin, but I thought Yonnie Jackson played well the other day (as 
a blocker) -- and so did (Brad) Banta. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, they're vulnerable, like all college teams, to a well-executed 
passing game, but eventually you've got to find another way to beat them, which 
includes a running game. Stanford couldn't run the ball, which is a credit to 
USC's defense." 
</P>
<P>
USC ranks fifth in the nation against the run after giving up only 103 yards on 
the ground in its last three games. Stanford ran for four yards in 19 attempts 
against USC. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be enough to get USC to Pasadena, but there are worse places to 
spend the holidays than New Orleans or Florida.

Reacting to the recent controversy over female sportswriters in locker rooms, a 
New Jersey legislator proposed to prohibit all media interviews for 30 minutes 
after the conclusion of sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John F. Russo said the bill would include sports from high school and 
college level to the four professional franchises that play in New Jersey. 
Russo said it would be in the best interest of sports and journalism for 
players to be allowed "to cool off and take a shower" before giving postgame 
interviews. 
</P>

The NFL and the New Jersey Press Assn. opposed the proposal.

NEWSWIRE: AMEN CORNER AT AUGUSTA DAMAGED BY FLOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters tournament each 
April, still haven't finished inspecting damage from heavy rains and flooding 
last week, but it appears some rebuilding will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Amen Corner, a stretch of three difficult holes, was one of the casualties when 
the remains of Tropical Storm Marco hit eastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The green on No. 11, first of the three holes, was washed away when Rae's Creek 
overflowed. Flood waters also damaged a bunker on No. 12, swamped the Byron 
Nelson Bridge and destroyed the members' tee box at No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were removing mud and sand left on the Nos. 12 and 13 fairways this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some damage, but we haven't had a chance to assess it yet because 
all the water has not receded," General Manager Jim Armstrong said Tuesday. "It 
appears, however, that the No. 11 green will have to be rebuilt."

OUTDOOR NOTES;

<P>
EVEN DEER HUNTERS FIND BEARS APLENTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game estimated there were 18,000 black bears in 
California when it persuaded the Sacramento Superior Court to reinstate a hunt 
this year, despite continued objections from animal-rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
But what that figure really means is becoming clear since the hunting started 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got bears coming out of our ears," said Herb Pierce, a DFG wildlife 
biologist in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Arrison, a biologist in Redding, said: "Talking to deer hunters, they're 
seeing more bears than they've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
That may be partly because there was no hunt last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some hunters are finding bears without even looking for them. A few of the 17 
who checked in bears at Redding the last two days were actually hunting for 
deer but were carrying bear tags, just in case, when an unlucky bruin wandered 
into their sights. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they're hunting without dogs, they get a pretty good percentage of 
the bears," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, 70% of the successful bear hunters use dogs to pursue and tree the 
animals. If deer hunters are taking them incidentally, there must be a large 
population. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pierce doubts that the quota of 1,250 will be reached before the hunt 
ends Dec. 30, even if the limit of 15,000 tags is sold. Historically, the 
hunter success rate is only about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
DFG wardens have a message for hunters: Read your tags and the fine print in 
the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ed DeGraffenreid said of a spot check of deer hunters one recent weekend, 
"Over one-third were cited for tag violations." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty were cited for fish and wildlife violations. Eleven citations were 
written for errors explained on the tag, such as a failing to notch the tag 
properly or not attaching it to the deer. 
</P>
<P>
Wardens said hunters also need to pay closer attention to zone boundaries and 
season dates. 
</P>
<P>
Let it grow, let it grow, let it grow: Anyone catching a king salmon under 20 
inches around the Channel Islands is urged to release it. 
</P>
<P>
It's the law, but it's especially important since more than 40,000 juvenile 
kings were released in Channel Islands Harbor last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fish and Game Advisory Commission, United Anglers of 
California and other volunteers have been distributing posters and warnings to 
anglers who might think the salmon are just another variety of ocean fish. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN FISHING -- A 619-pound blue marlin was landed after a 45-minute fight by 
Glendale's Ross Douglas aboard Point Loma Sportfishing's American Angler, which 
was on an eight-day trip that ended Oct. 12. The marlin had to be cut into 
three pieces so it would fit in the fish hold. . . . Seminars on light-tackle 
techniques for big-game fishing are scheduled tonight and Oct. 24 at Rio Hondo 
College in Whittier. Details: (213) 699-6189. 
</P>
<P>
HUNTING -- The Department of Fish and Game says it has openings for its annual 
junior pheasant hunt at Raahauge's Pheasant Club in Norco Nov. 3. Other shoots 
for hunters 16 and younger are scheduled at Palo Verde Nov. 17, the Imperial 
Valley and San Jacinto Dec. 1 and Lone Pine Dec. 31. Details: (213) 590-5126. 
</P>
<P>
After a limited hunt, the DFG is transferring 70 of the remaining 140 tule elk 
from its Grizzly Island Wildlife Area east of the Bay Area to reduce the herd 
to the habitat's carrying capacity. Last month's hunt took a quota of 30 elk -- 
10 bulls and 20 cows -- despite the interference of anti-hunting demonstrators, 
38 of whom were arrested. According to the DFG, California now has 21 herds 
with 2,700 elk -- the highest number since before the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
FLY-FISHING -- A slide program on "Northern California's Trout and Steelhead 
Opportunities" by guide-author Brad Jackson is scheduled at Greg Lilly's store 
in Tustin Saturday, Oct. 27, 1 p.m. . . . Dr. Lawrence Jelinek, professor of 
history at Loyola Marymount University, will discuss agriculture, water policy 
and environmentalism before the South Bay Flyfishers Nov. 7, 7:30 p.m., at the 
Westchester Townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fisher III, will teach fly casting for children ages 6-12 at Bob Marriott's 
Fly Fishing Fair Nov. 17-18. Details: (714) 525-1827. . . . The Long Beach 
Casting Club offers beginning fly tying each Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., for 17 weeks 
starting Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
SETTLEMENT -- In what skippers in Montauk, N.Y., say sets a bad precedent, a 
Montauk fisherman recently won a three-year legal fight over a 696-pound 
bluefin tuna that was kept by the crew of the Sgeria II. The International Game 
Fish Assn. reports that George Conserva was awarded $7,200 in an out-of-court 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Conserva, on a deep-sea charter with three friends, caught the fish on Aug. 16, 
1987. He said he was never told he couldn't keep the fish and he planned to 
have it mounted. Capt. Wink Doerzbacher told Conserva he was going to sell it 
to the Japanese, where there is a tremendous market for bluefin as sashimi. 
Enormous litigation costs led to the settlement in Conserva's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Moral: Check the captain's rules ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
NUMBERS -- U.S. fishing licenses bought in 1989 totaled 30,302,244. California 
sold the most, was the highest at 2,164,120, and Hawaii was the fewest, lowest 
at 9,282. 
</P>
<P>
BOATS -- The 22nd annual Long Beach Boat Show opens Friday at the Long Beach 
Convention Center, with 475 power and sail boats, 300 booth displays and 
seminars featuring fishing and outdoor travel experts. Hours: 3 to 10 p.m. 
weekdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays.

1992 BREEDERS' CUP RACES WILL BE RUN AT SANTA ANITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1992 Breeders' Cup races will be run at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the Oak Tree Racing Assn., which leases Santa Anita for the fall 
racing meeting, and the Breeders' Cup have come to terms after months of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The official announcement is expected after this year's Breeders' Cup, set for 
Belmont Park in New York on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the first four Breeders' Cups were held in California, but the races 
haven't been run on the West Coast since 1987, when Hollywood Park was the 
site. Hollywood Park also had the first Breeders' Cup, in 1984, and the races 
were run at Santa Anita in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's Breeders' Cup is scheduled for Churchill Downs in Louisville. BILL

GOLDEN PHEASANT IS LATEST TO BE FORCED FROM BREEDERS' CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A record-equaling 110 horses have been pre-entered for the Breeders' Cup, but 
one of the best in the group, Golden Pheasant, will not be running because of a 
training injury at Santa Anita that has probably ended his racing career. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant, owned by King owner Bruce McNall and his star player, Wayne 
Gretzky, was the early 2-1 favorite for the $2-million Turf Stakes, to be run 
along with the six other Breeders' Cup races at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y., 
on Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
However, Golden Pheasant took a bad step during a gallop Monday and broke the 
cannon bone, between the knee and the ankle, in his right foreleg. The horse, 
winner of the Arlington Million in his last start, will undergo surgery today 
at the Santa Anita equine hospital to have the small break fused by two or 
three screws. 
</P>
<P>
McNall was already trying to put together a breeding syndicate for Golden 
Pheasant for next year. The 4-year-old Caro colt, out of Perfect Pigeon, a 
Round Table mare, could probably resume training six months after the surgery, 
but now it is likely he will be sent to stud in time for the breeding season 
that starts in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders' Cup does have five of last year's winners -- Bayakoa, Steinlen, 
Rhythm, Go for Wand and Dancing Spree -- but because of recent form, victories 
by Steinlen and Dancing Spree would be considered surprises. Bayakoa and Go for 
Wand will meet in the Distaff, which figures to be the highlight of the day; 
Rhythm will run in the Classic; Steinlen will try to repeat in the Mile, and 
Dancing Spree will seek another victory in the Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-entry total matched the number that were made eligible for the 
Breeders' Cup at Aqueduct in 1985, the last time the races were held in New 
York. Owners had to pay 1% of the total purse, fees ranging from $10,000 to 
$30,000, to get their horses to this stage. Another 1% is due a week from 
today, to enter a horse. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Bayakoa and Best Pal, one of the favorites in the Juvenile, had 
to supplement their horses because they weren't nominated shortly after being 
foaled. It cost $200,000 for Bayakoa and $120,000 for Best Pal.

VOLLEYBALL COACHING CHANGES BRING IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coaches' names are not the only things changing in the women's volleyball 
programs at the University of San Diego and Point Loma Nazarene College. 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes, outlooks and positions in their conference standings are changing 
too. Drastically. 
</P>
<P>
USD, 2-26 a year ago, is 10-10 this season, including a current four-match 
winning streak. The Toreras are fourth in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
PLNC, which had its first winning season last year at 14-9, is 18-6, 11-0 in 
the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District III and 8-0 in the 
Golden State Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for such turnarounds, but players on both teams point 
most often to their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Snyder -- Sue Hegerle before she was married this summer to Ky Snyder, a 
former defensive back for San Diego State's football team -- came to USD from 
SDSU, where she was an assistant coach for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, reknowned for her intensity as an SDSU player, has carried that over in 
her coaching. Her first task, she said, was making the players believe in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we could do it," Snyder said. "But what good does that do? They're the 
ones that have to believe. It took awhile. But now we go into a match expecting 
to win. That mind-set has definitely changed." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Wnek -- Barbara Rozendal before she was married this summer to Mike 
Wnek -- is in her third season at PLNC. The Crusaders have improved each year 
under Wnek and have a legitimate shot at qualifying for the NAIA national 
tournament this year. 
</P>
<P>
With five key matches left, PLNC leads the district by 3 1/2 games. Should the 
Crusaders win the regular-season title, they would play host to the district 
tournament and receive a first-round bye. The winner of the tournament will 
probably get a bid to the national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, it's unusual even to mention such things in regard to PLNC. The 
student body, Wnek said, is starting to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
"The enthusiasm on campus has just been great," Wnek said. "There is really a 
lot of excitement around here." 
</P>
<P>
Add USD volleyball: Angie Rais, a senior from Anchorage, Alaska, is second in 
the conference in hitting, fourth in blocks and sixth in kills. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Shannon Mutch, a sophomore setter, set a WCC record with 89 assists in 
a five-game match Saturday against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Last add USD volleyball: License plate on the car of Kristi Harris, a setter: 
SET2KIL. 
</P>
<P>
The USD men's soccer team was set to play at Loyola Marymount last Wednesday 
when the match had to be canceled because there were no referees. It appears 
Loyola Coach Peter Novak neglected to inform the officials that the match had 
been switched from Nov. 10. No one seems to know for certain since . . . Novak 
is on his honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
The match has been rescheduled for Tuesday at USD. Torero Coach Seamus McFadden 
could have taken a forfeiture, but he elected to play the match since the tight 
West Coast Conference race could come down to a goal-differential tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
USD, ranked 17th in the nation, is 10-1-4. Loyola is 2-11 and has lost 10 in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long way to go up, but at least we got to eat at In-N-Out Burger," 
McFadden said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, McFadden is unaware that the fast-food chain has outlets here as 
well.

</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge is ranked 13th in this week's NCAA Division II football 
poll. The Matadors moved up two notches with a 34-24 victory over Southern Utah 
State in Cedar City, Utah, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which will play host to Cal State Sacramento in a 7 p.m. game 
Saturday at North Campus Stadium, has won five in a row since opening with a 
loss at Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Despite allowing 204 rushing yards against Southern Utah State, Northridge is 
10th among Division II teams in rushing defense. The Matadors allow an average 
of 96.5 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Nicholson will replace Jason Ferguson in the Northridge starting lineup 
at fullback, Coach Bob Burt said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, a 5-foot-9, 212-pound junior, rushed for 136 yards in 19 carries 
against Southern Utah State in his first start of the season. Ferguson, a 5-9, 
190-pound senior, did not make the trip because of a sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is excepted to play in a reserve role against Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Herazo of Newhall set a U. S. record in The Athletics Congress 
one-hour National Racewalking Championship for women Sunday in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Herazo walked 12,325 meters (7.66 miles) in one hour to better her national 
record of 12,051 meters set in 1988. She finished first in a field of 42 in a 
race in MIT's Steinbrenner Stadium and lapped second-place finisher Susan Liers 
twice.

STATWATCH: BARNUM, ALEMANY USE TRIED AND TRUE METHOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Same place. Same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Every one of Terry Barnum's school-record six touchdowns for Alemany High on 
Friday in a 41-7 win over Chaminade resulted from the same play: a basic 
off-tackle run. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the runs came on a play called "power right." The Indians really mixed 
things up on the other two scores by calling "power left." 
</P>
<P>
"We keep it simple," said Pat Blackburn, Alemany's coach. 
</P>
<P>
On the prolific play, Barnum takes a handoff from quarterback Adam Romandi and 
makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I cut up if there is a hole off tackle or I bounce outside if the defensive 
end collapses inside," Barnum said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Chaminade, Barnum raced outside defenders on the first five scores and 
cut up off-tackle on the final touchdown, which was his second run of 62 yards. 
Barnum, a junior, gained 258 yards in the game, breaking a school record 
previously held by Art Golden, who rushed for 221 yards in a game in 1963. 
Golden and Barnum now share the school record for most touchdowns in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Passing: Westlake quarterback Todd Preston, who holds 12 school records, has 
passed for 4,536 yards in 28 games. He has thrown for 1,355 yards this season 
and needs an additional 1,053 to break into the Southern Section's top-10 
all-time list. . . . Preston threw for 327 yards against Channel Islands last 
week and broke Brad Gossen's school record of 311, set in 1985 against Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Hart quarterback Ryan Connors completed five of five fourth-down passes to keep 
Indian scoring drives alive in a 35-6 victory over Alhambra. Connors completed 
25 of 47 passes for a career-high 296 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: With 124 points, Glendale's Pathon Rucker is 52 ahead of anyone in the 
area. Running back Kent Dahn of Harvard has 72 points and Fillmore's Tory 
Cabral, who plays running back and kicker, has 71. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Keyed by the play of inside linebackers Damon Tice and Alex Sawatzke, 
the Kennedy defense has allowed four touchdowns and an average of 139.8 yards 
in five games. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 34-13 victory over Chatsworth, the pair were overwhelming in 
helping limit Chatsworth to 73 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sawatzke, a 6-foot-1, 210-pound junior, was credited with 10 solo tackles and 
10 assists. Tice, a 6-foot, 220-pound senior, had seven solo tackles, 12 
assists and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Friday's Grant-Van Nuys game, the Grant defense had given up just 213 
yards rushing in four games. But the Lancers allowed Van Nuys (1-3, 1-1) to run 
all over them, rushing for 180 yards, the most by any opponent this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Monroe intercepted five passes and recovered eight fumbles. This 
season, after just four games, Monroe (0-3-1, 0-2) has intercepted seven passes 
and recovered eight fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking: Hoover's David Bronner, who has kicked a 65-yard punt, made a 52-yard 
field goal in a loss to Pasadena. The senior also was successful from 57 yards, 
but the kick was nullified because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Drought ends: Poly's 40-28 victory against host Monroe on Friday night was its 
first win away from home since 1987, according to Coach Fred Cuccia. 
</P>
<P>
Turnaround: Before last week's Grant-Van Nuys game, Van Nuys gave up an average 
of 317 yards. Van Nuys allowed just 106 yards in its 5-0 victory over Grant. 
Furthermore, Van Nuys previously had rushed for a total of 212 yards in three 
games but against Grant the ground game rolled up a season-high 180 yards.

AFTER SHOCKS

<TEXT>
<P>
People go about their business. But for almost everyone who lived through the 
biggest earthquake in California since 1906, life remains different a year 
after. 
</P>
<P>
The differences can be subtle. People may jump when a truck rolls by, or when 
the washing machine spins and shakes the house. Many people need more time to 
gain their composure when a small temblor rumbles through. Some people still 
won't cross the Bay Bridge. Some people have moved away. No one who survived 
the earthquake on that warm evening last Oct. 17 ever wants to experience 
another one like it. For people who came close to death, whose homes are no 
more, who saw up close the destruction the quake wrought, the effect will 
remain forever. Times Staff Writer Dan Morain talked with some of those people. 
Here are their stories. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's not debilitating, but it is difficult.' 
</P>
<P>
 Jack -- 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake hit while I was under concrete. Worst happened it collapsed on my 
car. I'm alive just my left foot is stuck under the car. Hope they don't kill 
me getting me out. I love you lots. Good luck to both of us. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, Dorothy Otto said, an informational memo to her husband written as she 
sat trapped in her car, tons of concrete from the collapsed Cypress Viaduct all 
around. She wrote the words "I love you lots" only after she smelled smoke from 
a car that caught fire up ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Otto, 45, is one of the lucky ones pulled to safety. A year later, she sat in 
the living room of her Marin County home with Jack. A chunk of concrete from 
the collapsed freeway lay on her coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
"I can truthfully tell you my life will never be the same. But my life is not 
ruined," she said. She had once felt she was invincible. "And now I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Otto knows exactly where she was at 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989: under beam 
104-A. The concrete beam seemed to explode. It crashed down on the hood of her 
1988 Pontiac Bonneville SSE. The crushed front end pinned her in by her left 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Under tons of concrete from the upper deck, the lower deck on which she was 
driving plunged down 25 feet. She realized she was choking on dust from the 
rubble and it struck her that she was alive "and that was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Marin that evening, Jack turned on the television. When the camera 
panned to the Cypress, he felt a cold chill. He knew where his wife was. All 
night, he waited by the phone, not speaking to a niece and nephew who sat with 
him, not eating, just staring at the television. 
</P>
<P>
From where she sat, Dorothy could see light, and hear the heroic people who ran 
to help. Her left foot felt like it was ablaze. "I had no idea pain could hurt 
like this," she said. She could be saved, she shouted, if only someone could 
free her foot. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to tear it free," she said. "I could not do it." 
</P>
<P>
Her life did not flash before her eyes, she did not pray. But she did worry her 
insurance company would not cover the damage to the car. A man, a hero named 
Tom, arrived. A man named Clyde came, too, crawling to her through a narrow 
passageway between the decks. They used a crowbar to try to pry her free from 
the car. It wouldn't budge. She bit on an old rag to keep from screaming out in 
pain. She still marvels at Tom and Clyde's bravery. 
</P>
<P>
Jack sat in front of the television wondering how to let authorities know that 
Dorothy was missing. She always calls when she is away on business. Sometimes 
the phone doesn't ring until 3 a.m. That's fine with him. The important thing 
is that he hears from her. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to know she's OK, or I can't function. My day is shot if I don't get 
a call," Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from Oakland's Engine House No. 1 arrived. They spent an hour 
cutting the car from around her. She knows them all by name, and calls them "my 
firefighters." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 10:45 p.m., Jack's phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
"We have your wife here and she would like to talk to you," the voice from the 
hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
"I made it," Dorothy remembers telling him. "Then we kind of whimpered at each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Jack said, "it was great." 
</P>
<P>
She broke no bones, but she has not recovered completely. A knee is still 
bruised, but her left foot is not permanently damaged. A few weeks ago, she 
watched a television movie about the earthquake, and she got ill. 
</P>
<P>
She is quick-witted and outgoing, traits that make her a good saleswoman. But 
sometimes on a trip she thinks about dying in a plane crash. That sort of 
thought never used to cross her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Jack, 47, a Vietnam veteran who survived the 1968 Tet offensive, knows about 
such fears, and about nightmares. "You're never going to get over it," he tells 
her. "You will learn to deal with it. It will come back in bits and pieces, at 
the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
The Ottos had come to California a year before the quake from New York where 
she was a national accounts manager for the Weyerhaeuser Co. selling corrugated 
boxes. She took a step down when she moved West, but she had good reason for 
doing it. She wanted to help a sister care for a son who has AIDS, and another 
son who sustained a head injury in a fall. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I figure I didn't get smashed," she said. "I came here with a pure 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she changed jobs, and has one comparable to what she left in New 
York. But as hard as she works, she has a tough time on some Mondays. On those 
difficult Monday mornings, she goes to her car, then gets ill and has to return 
to the house until she regains her composure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not debilitating," she said. "But it is difficult to deal with."

NPR'S SIMON 'PARACHUTES IN' FOR S.D. STORY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE POPULAR NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO FIGURE MAKES BRIEF SAN DIEGO STOP FOR 
A STORY ON THE BORDER.

<P>
Scott Simon was handling the drudgery of a luncheon with the media rather well, 
considering he was operating on almost no sleep after a night along the border 
developing a story for "Weekend Edition," the Saturday morning program he hosts 
for National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is not staying up all night -- black coffee can take care of that -- 
it is knowing what you're doing," said Simon, taking a gentle stab at himself 
for banging his knee against a highway divider during the previous night's 
adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's literate, stylish features have given him "almost a cult following 
among the Saturday morning leisure set," according to the Christian Science 
Monitor. The weekly audience for the 5-year-old "Weekend Edition" has grown to 
more than a million, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday luncheon with four members of the local press, designed to promote 
the 30th anniversary of KPBS-FM (89.5), was part of whirlwind tour of San Diego 
for the 38-year-old journalist. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, it was off to the KPBS studios for an interview. Then he traded 
his wrinkled shirt for a double-breasted suit and acted as the guest of honor 
at a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of KPBS, the local public 
broadcasting affiliate. His duties included posing for pictures, shovel in 
hand, planting a tree and making small talk at a cocktail reception. 
</P>
<P>
After the handshaking session, it was back to the border to try to collect more 
material for his story -- "a look at the the extraordinary society that springs 
out of the countryside every night" -- before returning to Washington to help 
put together Saturday's program. 
</P>
<P>
Simon sounded almost embarrassed to, as he put it, "parachute in" to San Diego 
to report on a story that is well covered here. It is part of the job he 
regrets, the inability to spend time in an area, to really soak up the 
atmosphere. He is in a new part of the world almost every week. 
</P>
<P>
"When you parachute in, your own ignorance is a real factor, you do the best 
you can," he said between bites of salad. But there are advantages. "In many 
ways, journalism is most effective when you are a stranger, when you adopt that 
viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
The border story has always intrigued Simon, who spent many years covering the 
turmoil in Central America. In the past, he has done reports from along the 
border in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important story that raises questions about our national identity," 
Simon said, looking the person asking the question square in the eyes, while 
his hands played with the sugar dispenser on the table. 
</P>
<P>
As he often does, he was able to find "puckish" elements in the people seeking 
a new life across the border. Humor, irreverence and a general uplifting tone 
are common elements of his work, perhaps reflecting the influence of his 
parents, comedian Ernie Simon and actress Patricia Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't prepared for the extraordinary wit of some of the people" along the 
border, Simon said. "One man said he just wanted to see Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
But the trip to San Diego was dictated by the invitation to participate in the 
KPBS anniversary activities as much as any story ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a year, Simon travels to public broadcasting affiliates, usually during 
fund-raising efforts. NPR is becoming more dependent on affiliates for 
financial input, which creates more of a symbiotic relationship between the 
network and the affiliates, which want to be more involved in the NPR decision 
making process. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dues are becoming very expensive, while there are more possibilities for 
programming available to the stations," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't bother Simon as much as NPR's growing reliance on financing from 
corporations and foundations. It doesn't create anything as overt as influence 
on news stories, but the involvement of corporations does encourage a 
"blockbuster mentality," he said, a need to do big, exciting, high profile 
stories so the sponsor feels it's getting something for it's money. 
</P>
<P>
"We had plenty of money to cover the unraveling of communism in Europe," Simon 
said. "But when we wanted to do something on health care in Harlem, there was 
no money available." 
</P>
<P>
If it wasn't for NPR, Simon says he wouldn't be in radio. 
</P>
<P>
"NPR is the kind of journalism I always wanted to do -- vivid, narrative and, 
when appropriate, stories with a literary bent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he wasn't in radio, Simon believes he probably would be pursuing a religious 
vocation. As many of his listeners know, he's a Quaker, a "member of the 
Society of Friends," although he was raised Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
His religious beliefs rarely intrude on his stories, he said. But there is no 
separating his roots, who he is, from his role as journalist. 
</P>
<P>
"My instinctive reaction to stories is as someone who grew up in Chicago. That 
stays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His human side often emerges in his reporting. More than a reflection of his 
own beliefs, he feels it simply raises questions that all journalists should be 
asking on stories. 
</P>
<P>
The example that emerges is coverage of the current Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense reporters over there are infatuated with technology," Simon said. 
"They leave some of the important, intrinsic moral questions behind. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not enough skepticism. The question needs to be asked, how many 
civilians are they willing to kill?" 
</P>
<P>
Simon has covered wars in El Salvador, Grenada and the Middle East. He believes 
reporters have a duty to make their audience understand the realities of war. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people understand what conventional war is anymore," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has been with NPR for 13 years, earning two prestigious George F. Peabody 
awards for his radio essays. As an interviewer, he is often compared to Ted 
Koppel, while his easy-going descriptive style, reflecting his mid-eastern 
roots, reminds some of Garrison Keilor. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's topics for his radio essays range from the homey to the bizarre; his 
guests from the boy-next-door to world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there are hilarious swings in subjects," he said. His favorite was 
segueing from a dog that played the piano to an interview with Ariel Sharon. 
Killing time between the two segments, he thought he made an embarrassing 
mistake, telling Sharon he was following the piano-playing dog. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sharon was amused. Simon imitated Sharon's reaction: "A dog played 
piano? I'd like to see this."

MESOAMERICA AND INTIMACY WITH NATURE

<P>
It takes quite a mental leap to enter the world of ancient Mesoamerica from our 
contemporary, urban cocoon. The shift in sensibilities is dramatic and may even 
evoke some surprising jealousies if one contrasts today's techno-efficient 
mind-set with the sturdy spiritual and aesthetic scaffolding that framed 
Mesoamerican culture. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty and integrity of the work in the Mingei International Museum's 
current show, "Precolumbian Flora and Fauna: Continuity of Plant and Animal 
Themes in Mesoamerican Art," help make that mental leap inviting. Once 
transported, the ingenuity of form and depth of belief so abundant in the show 
can both nourish and instruct the mindful viewer. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit (through Feb. 17) does more than offer a rich survey of painted, 
carved and modeled animal and plant forms from present-day Mexico and its 
southern neighbors. It reminds us of what we have lost and may never recapture: 
a cycle of respect among the species, an interdependence that ensures mutual 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
The Mingei show focuses on the continuity of certain motifs and belief systems 
across Precolumbian cultures, but the work itself speaks more of distinction, 
of individuals' creativity, their endless, marvelous permutations on familiar 
forms and functional objects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the show and its well-illustrated catalogue are divided into four 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
The first three represent the three tiers of the Precolumbian cosmos -- air, 
earth and underworld -- and the final section presents contemporary examples of 
thematically related folk art from the Mesoamerica region. 
</P>
<P>
"Precolumbian man used animals to understand and order natural phenomena," 
explains guest curator Jeanette Favrot Peterson in her catalogue essay. 
</P>
<P>
"Ancient societies structured their world view using plant and animal 
metaphors; they endowed their deities with powers symbolized by fauna and 
flora; their ruling elite borrowed from nature those characteristics they 
wished to emulate and control." Hence, when a Mayan ruler wore a waterlily 
insignia, the flower's associations with agricultural canals and the watery 
underworld bestowed power to the ruler over fertility and the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
Tight visual and conceptual links bound the earth to its occupants in 
Precolumbian culture, which spanned roughly 3,000 years, from about 1,500 B.C. 
up to the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. The crocodile, for example, was 
one of several fish-like creatures that came to symbolize the earthly realm, 
for it floated on water, just like land, resting atop the fluid underworld. 
Further, the patterns on the backs of crocodiles, turtles and toads were 
compared to the geometric patterns of tilled fields. And the snake's shedding 
of its skin each year came to represent the Earth's own seasonal renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitivity to the form, texture and behavior of animals ran high among the 
Olmec, Maya and Aztec cultures, and the candor and energy of the animal figures 
here bear witness to the artists' close observation as well as his belief in 
the animals' spiritual power. A clay monkey effigy (550-800 A.D.) with a 
sacrificial rope around its neck wears an expression of uncanny honesty, as if 
aware of the higher meaning bestowed upon his life and death as purveyor of 
creativity and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs, though domesticated, were also eaten and offered as sacrifices to the 
gods in ancient Mesoamerica, which comprised Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, 
most of Mexico and parts of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Most of the 
canine figures capture the animal's frisky, friendly nature, nuzzling into 
another's neck, gnawing on a bone, or squirming on its back, with legs poking 
up into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to depict essences of form and character overshadow any concern for 
detailed representation. Forms are often simplified and generalized. This 
paring down not only heightens the vitality of the forms but lends them 
integrity as abstract design, a fact not lost on such early 20th-Century 
modernists as Picasso and Braque. 
</P>
<P>
Form and function meld gracefully in vessels whose openings double as dog 
tails, or whose handles are formed by the arching body of a bird. In one Mayan 
vessel of buff clay, a cylindrical base incised with delicate patterns supports 
a horizontal fish. The vessel's opening, a large round hole in the creature's 
belly, echoes the shape of the fish's bulging eye and is subtly framed by the 
arch of its fins. 
</P>
<P>
The show concludes with a small selection of masks, vessels and ritual objects 
from contemporary Mexico and Central America. Native beliefs have persisted, 
despite the Spanish imposition of Christianity in the 16th Century, and the 
continuity of themes and motifs during Precolumbian times still holds today.

VAMPING FOR THE VOTE;

RECORD INDUSTRY COALITION PUSHES REGISTRATION CAMPAIGN

Leave it to Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
Who else could transform the simple act of voting into a provocative display of 
sexual innuendo? 
</P>
<P>
On Monday at 10 p.m., MTV will debut the pop siren's latest video clip: a 
60-second, rap-oriented public service advertisement in which she encourages 
her fans to express themselves at the voting booth: 
</P>
<P>
Dr. King, Malcom X 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom of speech 
</P>
<P>
 Is as good as sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna delivers the rhyme wearing red bikini underwear with an American flag 
curled around her shoulders. She ends the clip with the teasing quip, 'If you 
don't vote, you're going to get a spankie." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's TV spot is the latest in a series of pro-voting ads designed to 
motivate pop fans -- especially the 18-to-24 age group -- to become active in 
the political process. Other pop artists who have made clips include Iggy Pop, 
M.C. Hammer, Ozzy Osbourne, Mellow Man Ace, Megadeth, Donny Osmond, Lita Ford, 
Lenny Kravitz, and Los Lobos' Louis Perez. 
</P>
<P>
MTV will show all the spots in a half-hour "Rock the Vote" special beginning 
after the Madonna ad. 
</P>
<P>
The ads, which run about twice an hour on MTV, were commissioned by "Rock the 
Vote," a nonprofit, nonpartisan recording industry coalition made up of some of 
the most powerful figures in the music business -- including the presidents of 
Warner Bros., Capitol, Geffen, MCA, A&amp;M, Virgin and Giant Records. The 
voter registration campaign is the most ambitious step yet on the part of the 
record industry to respond to the widening debate over explicit lyrics in pop 
music. Concerned over recent court rulings deeming 2 Live Crew's rap music 
obscene and the obscenity-related arrests of record retailers and pop music 
artists throughout the country, music industry executives are on the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do here is stimulate young rock fans to consider the 
issues at hand and begin to participate in the democratic process," said Virgin 
Records co-managing director Jeff Ayeroff. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a new generation gap and government officials like (Sen.) Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) are taking advantage of it. They assume that because young music 
lovers rarely vote that they can trample on the rights of rock artists and not 
worry about retaliation at the election booth. We aim to turn that around." 
</P>
<P>
Ayeroff and Virgin co-managing director Jordan Harris unveiled the concept for 
the voter registration drive at a July 11 meeting in Beverly Hills attended by 
a cross-section of musicians, writers, directors, actors, executives and 
entrepreneurs who have all cooperated in donating time and money to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Capitol Records president Hale Milgrim says "Rock the Vote" has united an 
unlikely combination of corporate competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get different record companies to agree upon anything," 
Milgrim said this week. "But something as patriotic and positive as this 
campaign, one that activates young people to get involved in government, is 
certain to be applauded by every American, regardless of their political 
persuasion." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is clapping. 
</P>
<P>
While national media watchdog groups such as the Focus on the Family of Pomona 
and the Parents Music Resource Center of Washington have no problem with the 
campaign, Sandy Crawford, editor of the Alexandria, Va., newsletter TV etc., 
questions the political strategy behind the "Rock the Vote" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
TV etc., which analyzes political activities of the Hollywood entertainment 
industry, is distributed by the Media Research Center, a watchdog group founded 
by conservative activist L. Brent Bozell III. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface it looks real nice," Crawford said. "These (public service 
announcements) sound like an innocuous invitation to register young people to 
vote, but how can they can call it nonpartisan when the underlying goal of the 
drive is to remove conservative government officials like Jesse Helms from 
office?" 
</P>
<P>
Ayeroff disputes Crawford's assessment, arguing that at least 30% of those 
signing up to vote as a result of the campaign are registering as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a campaign about bashing conservatives," Ayeroff said. "It's about 
preserving the piety of freedom of speech and dealing with the demagogues who 
are trying to destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
Setting their sights on the 1992 presidential election, "Rock the Vote" 
officials have created a strategy to market their pro-voting, anti-censorship 
theme on college campuses, concert tours and through promotional contests soon 
to be initiated on radio, television and at record retail outlets such as Tower 
and Wherehouse Records. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration booths were set up at "The Gathering of the Tribes" benefit, 
the heavy-metal Foundations Forum convention and a recent California campus 
concert tour that ended last week at UCLA, yielding more than 10,000 new 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
MTV vice president and creative director Judy McGrath maintains that her 
network -- which debuted the public service campaign at the MTV Video Awards 
Show on Sept. 6 -- has already donated more than $1 million in air time to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a new collection of pro-voting clips featuring country artists 
such as Randy Travis, Tammy Wynette, Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless and Brenda 
Lee is also expected to begin airing on VH-1 within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term project," said Geffen Records president Eddie Rosenblatt 
by phone from New York. "Our commitment to 'Rock the Vote' will extend beyond 
the upcoming November election. The goal is to alter the voter make-up of the 
1992 election. Once young people are aware of what censorship means, we believe 
that voter apathy will cease."

A FAMILY REUNION OF LOOK-ALIKES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when the Sunday funnies included a page of puzzles and games? A 
drawing called What's Wrong With This Picture? challenged us to spot all sorts 
of goofy things like ladies with mustaches and trains with no tracks. In a 
variation, we were supposed to pick out differences in two apparently identical 
drawings. Those games were great basic training in how to look at art. 
</P>
<P>
Very carefully. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will launch a new series of 
small exhibitions called "Masterpiece in Focus." It has the praiseworthy intent 
of drawing attention to a great museum treasure often taken for granted. The 
permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
The masterpiece in focus here is "Soap Bubbles" by the 18th-Century French 
genius of genre, Jean-Simeon Chardin. Any traveler who takes museums casually 
might get an attack of deja vu upon encountering "Soap Bubbles." Didn't I see 
that at the National Gallery in Washington? Maybe it was the Metropolitan in 
New York. Can't remember. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, both. 
</P>
<P>
All three museums own versions of this beloved picture. Anybody who lacks a 
photographic memory can be forgiven for thinking they are identical. Well, 
LACMA has borrowed the other two, and they all hang in the European paintings 
gallery waiting to be seen -- really seen side by side by side. 
</P>
<P>
What's right with these pictures? 
</P>
<P>
Each depicts a boy leaning on a stone casement blowing a bubble through a 
straw. A toddler in a plumed hat peeps over the parapet to see what's going on. 
Fasten on that central image and it's like looking at triplets. Everything is 
in the same place -- bubbles, noses, pony-tailed hair, the crook of a finger. 
Looks like the artist used a template, and he probably did. 
</P>
<P>
Chardin (1699-1779) came from a modest background and lacked the classical 
education it usually took to join the elite Royal Academy painters of mythical 
and historical subjects. Even though he eventually made it into the academy, it 
was as a painter of declasse still lifes. In the early 1730s, he took to scenes 
of everyday life with the double motive of improving his status in the pecking 
order and turning a profit by tailgating a fashion for Dutch genre -- paintings 
of everyday life. LACMA curator Philip Conisbee and conservator Joseph Fronck 
explain it all in an informative brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, "Soap Bubbles" was among his first forays into the genre and painting 
was tough for him at the best of times. Apparently, after an exhausting 
struggle to bring off the original, he decided to capitalize the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Copies! Fakes! 
</P>
<P>
Piffle. Before the Romantic movement, people weren't as obsessed with artistic 
uniqueness as they later became. But which is the original? 
</P>
<P>
All of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Each bears Chardin's undisputed signature painted on the parapet as if carved 
in the stone. 
</P>
<P>
None of the above. 
</P>
<P>
There is a fourth painting in the installation, not another "Soap Bubbles," but 
Chardin's picture of a girl playing knucklebones -- a primitive form of jacks. 
Scholars think it was a companion piece to the original "Soap Bubbles" but it 
bears a significant difference that can only be seen with X-ray. The evidence 
is on view. Under the surface of "Knucklebones" the camera sees marks of the 
artist changing his mind as he worked, giving the girl more decolletage, for 
example. By significant contrast, none of the three "Soap Bubbles" shows 
changes -- so-called pentimenti. Chances are all three are the artist's copies 
of a lost original. 
</P>
<P>
But we're talking about looking at paintings, not through them. Even though 
very similar, these are clearly not Warhol Brillo boxes. Each has subtly 
different expressive vectors. Oddly enough, each tends to match one of three 
interpretations traditionally attached to all of them. 
</P>
<P>
In art, all differences make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The New York canvas takes a certain authority from being a few inches larger. 
It was expanded at some point, but it's always been vertical. Verticality lends 
alertness. Tendrils of honeysuckle waft from an upper corner softening a somber 
palette to dreaminess. Hinting of Chardin's rococo contemporary, Boucher, it 
most closely belongs to those romantics who feel in it the bittersweet brevity 
of love. 
</P>
<P>
The National Gallery's picture was badly served by additions and wrong-headed 
restoration long before it came to Washington. Still charming, it is not helped 
by some clunky honeysuckle clearly added by another hand. A horizontal format 
lends it gravity, both physical and expressive. It will bear the interpretation 
of those who think "Soap Bubbles" is a gentle French nag directed at youths who 
waste time on nice days. 
</P>
<P>
Also horizontal, but bereft of foliage, the L.A. version is the starkest of the 
three. It's also in the best visual condition with its slow, assured modeling. 
Could be this was one of the later copies made when Chardin had perfected his 
practice. It comes off according to the classic memento mori interpretation as 
a rumination on the fragility of life itself. It somehow recalls the great 
Zurburan still life in the Norton Simon Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Isolating a preference among these paintings is like Paris trying to pick his 
lady. It might change according to mood, but the fact a choice exists shows how 
telling a nuance can be, even among paintings that are so nearly alike. 
</P>
<P>
Which of these pictures is best? Well, if you like tough art and polite 
aesthetic competition, the home team wins.

<P>
Ratt, the first San Diego heavy metal band to be signed by a major label, has 
released its fifth album on Atlantic Records. 
</P>
<P>
"Detonator" is much lighter and more commercial-sounding than their last album, 
1988's "Reach for the Sky," which went gold but didn't sell nearly as well as 
their previous albums. That's because all the songs on "Detonator" were 
co-written with executive producer Desmond Child, who has penned hits for the 
likes of Bon Jovi and Alice Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
It was a good move, bringing in some outside help. Ever since their 
double-platinum Atlantic debut, 1984's "Out of the Cellar," the members of Ratt 
have been having an increasingly tough time coming up with new ideas. Yet they 
persisted in writing their own material, repeating themselves over and over 
again, until someone apparently convinced them a change was in order. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-core head bangers might sneer at this new "Ratt Lite," but as far as I'm 
concerned, the change is for the better. For once, there are actually songs 
with distinct melodies, songs with hooks, songs that sound like songs instead 
of a beer bottle cap stuck in a garbage disposal. "Lovin' You's a Dirty Job" is 
a particularly radio-ready track; "Hard Time" is a great rock 'n' roll song 
with some spectacular lead guitar work by Warren DeMartini. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic has also issued a Ratt video, "Detonator: Videoaction 1991." The 
half-hour tape includes two tunes apiece off "Detonator" and "Reach for the 
Sky," as well as an interview conducted by Little Richard. 
</P>
<P>
Ratt began life in San Diego in the late 1970s as Mickey Ratt. It regularly 
played the Spirit in Bay Park and various teen clubs, such as the long-gone 
Journey in Kearny Mesa. In 1981, lead singer Stephen Pearcy moved the band to 
Los Angeles and shortened its name to Ratt. 
</P>
<P>
Several personnel changes later (which saw fellow expatriate San Diegans 
DeMartini and guitarist Robbin Crosby join the group), Ratt was signed by 
Enigma Records, which released the eponymous debut in 1983; a year later, Ratt 
was picked up by Atlantic, for whom it has recorded ever since.

SAN FRANCISCO EXHUMES 'DON QUICHOTTE';

MASSENET: FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FEODOR CHALIAPIN, SAMUEL RAMEY TURNS 
SUBLIME MADNESS INTO A LYRIC TRIUMPH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cervantes sings again. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the impossible dream bears no Broadway glitz. Don Quichotte 
-- a.k.a. Quixote -- is tilting at distinctly operatic windmills in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Jules Massenet's sugar-coated portrait of the eccentric man of la Mancha has 
not fared particularly well in the opera house. Although "Don Quichotte" served 
as a grateful vehicle for Feodor Chaliapin at the Monte Carlo premiere back in 
1910, the opera has been revived only sporadically in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, its survival in the repertory has depended on the whim of popular 
bassos who want to be profondo in quest of romantic grotesquerie. Vanni Marcoux 
actually eclipsed Chaliapin in the composer's favor as the protagonist. In 
recent years, both Ruggero Raimondi and Nicolai Ghiaurov have triumphed in the 
challenge. San Diego ventured "Don Quichotte" on behalf of the unforgettable 
Norman Treigle in 1969, only to introduce a very young Michael Devlin in the 
role when Treigle fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Samuel Ramey's turn. At the War Memorial Opera House on Sunday, the 
American basso didn't attempt much of a character study. He pasted some 
appropriate gray whiskers on his youthful face and donned a whispy wig. 
Otherwise, he remained the handsome matinee idol to whom we have become 
accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, his Don might just as well have been named Giovanni. One 
expected him to proudly bare his hairy chest at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
Ramey let us forget about the aging knight of the doleful countenance. He 
conveyed little of the sublime madness that should illuminate the hero's 
quixotic manners and quirky stances. He did convey essential dignity, however, 
and he sang very nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Sang very nicely? That is a ridiculous understatement. 
</P>
<P>
Ramey sang beautifully. He sang magnificently. 
</P>
<P>
He sang with firm, warm, rolling, even tone. He sang with ease that flagged at 
neither range extreme, with extraordinary lyrical suavity and reasonable 
dramatic point. 
</P>
<P>
When the spirit moved him, he even sang softly. Muted dynamics have never been 
a Ramey specialty. But here, in moments of ecstatic reflection, he floated 
pianissimo tones that created their own aura of mystical pathos. It was a happy 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Any vocal performance of such quality would justify the exhumation of a work as 
flawed as "Don Quichotte." Compounding good operatic fortune, San Francisco 
managed to complement Ramey with two eminently worthy colleagues and a 
remarkably sympathetic conductor. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Trempont as the doggedly devoted Sancho Panca provided an ideal 
counterforce -- dramatically earthy and musically elegant. He steadfastly 
avoided comic caricature and, despite rather slender baritonal resources, 
tugged the assembled heart-strings heftily in the climactic scena beginning 
"Ca, vous commetez tous un acte epouvantable." 
</P>
<P>
Last seen here as Waltraute, Katherine Ciesinski portrayed Dulcinee, the 
mezzo-soprano vamp with a heart of gold and an abiding love of pearls. She sang 
with vibrant insinuation and acted with alluring abandon that nearly validated 
the inherent cliches. 
</P>
<P>
In the well-staffed pit, Julius Rudel made Massenet's perfumed banalities sound 
sensuous, urgent, even noble. This American conductor from Austria really knows 
his way around the fragile French repertory. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to report that San Francisco provided an appropriately 
compelling theatrical framework. Unfortunately, the physical production turned 
out to be a thing of shreds and patches. 
</P>
<P>
The innocuous, painterly canvases were borrowed from Chicago. Pierluigi 
Samaritani, the designer, demanded that his name be removed from the credits, 
however, when numerous modifications distorted his original scenic vision. One 
cannot blame him. 
</P>
<P>
The all-purpose costumes, also attributed to no one, came from the warehouse of 
the Opera de Marseilles, as did a monstrous, nightmarish puppet that rose in 
the sky near the windmill -- breaching the quasi-realistic style of the 
production in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Another import from Marseilles was the stage director, Charles Roubaud. He 
functioned primarily as a traffic cop. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Morgan's incidental dances looked like frantic exercises for some 
ballet troupe gone a-slumming. The chorus, trained by Ian Robertson, made nice 
noises and struck friendly poses. 
</P>
<P>
The stage pictures certainly were stilted. At least they were pretty. 
</P>
<P>
And so -- for all its sentimental vapidity -- was the music.

GROSS LEADS THE SANTA MONICA SEASON OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Look into the nooks and crannies of this city's musical landscape and you'll 
find community orchestras, some of them quite good. Sunday night at Santa 
Monica Civic Auditorium one such ensemble, the Santa Monica Symphony, opened 
its 1990-91 season under the baton of Allen Robert Gross. 
</P>
<P>
Gross, who leads the Occidental-Caltech Symphony, is one of two conductors left 
over from last year's auditions for music director. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably his two concerts this season serve as a second-round tryout for the 
still-vacant position. He proved a genial and attentive podium presence, 
instilling confidence and energy in his players with smiles and clear-cut 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were some rough edges apparent in the playing, they remained 
just that, edges to otherwise solid performances. The lack of technical polish 
-- this group consists of a mixture of amateurs and professionals -- never got 
in the way of the essence of the music. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Second Symphony opened the concert, in a vigorous and dashing 
interpretation. Gross opted for steady, fastish tempos and light accents, 
lending understated nuance to phrasing with elegant left-hand motions. He 
coaxed an admirable forcefulness from his string section, and enthusiasm 
infused the entire reading. 
</P>
<P>
In Stravinsky's "Firebird" Suite, which concluded the concert, the orchestra 
impressively captured its kaleidoscopic color. Coupled with Gross's lucid 
interpretation -- its poised balances, solid rhythms and contrasted dynamics -- 
the music spoke with a directness that didn't slight its poetry. 
</P>
<P>
In between came Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme with Philharmonic 
principal cellist Ronald Leonard as soloist. He brought his usual technical 
ease to the task, his singing tone capturing in full measure the playfulness 
and pointed lyricism of this score. The orchestra accompanied handily, with 
particularly sensitive work from the woodwind section. T.M.

'PAD': STRONG EXECUTION OF INGE DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death Row has always seemed a strange place for a William Inge play. "The Last 
Pad" turned out to be Inge's final play, and until now its biggest notoriety 
was that it helped make Nick Nolte a star when it premiered at the old Contempo 
Theatre (now the Westwood Playhouse) in 1973, four days after the playwright's 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the play is back again, in a strong production presented by Amnesty 
International at the Friends and Artists Theatre. Inge, who expanded and 
developed "The Last Pad" from his earlier execution-day drama, "The Disposal," 
did not bring any fresh ideas to the anti-capital punishment theme. In fact, 
Inge stacked the deck with three Death Row inmates in "The Last Pad" who, if 
not wholly sympathetic, are classic arguments against state-sanctioned 
executions. Fair enough. 
</P>
<P>
What rings true in the production is Inge's dramatic instinct, the 
give-and-take among the prisoners, which keeps the play from slipping into 
pretension. You feel you're in prison, for one thing (Robert Zentis is the 
designer, and the clanging doors are a chilling sound effect). Ultimately, the 
show's energy can be clearly traced to director Billy Hayes, and it can't go 
ignored that Hayes is the same Hayes who spent five years in a Turkish prison, 
as chronicled in the book and film "Midnight Express." If ever a director was 
right for a job, Hayes is it. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes takes a little license. There's a gay inmate (Archie, the bulky, bitchy 
and devastatingly cynical and witty Peter Van Norden) who asks the guard during 
mail call if he has a letter for him from Richard Gere. Back in 1973, Inge's 
movie star who triggered the chuckle was Alain Delon. And Hayes has introduced 
to the script, in the play's final moments, a shockingly realistic wooden model 
of an electric chair. Straps, a Frankenstein metal head plate and searing 
lighting ignite the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The play demands an ending at this point, but there is an anti-climatic scene 
with yet a new doomed youth who takes the cell that was the last pad of 
wife-killer and leading character Jess (the convincing Alan Gelfant). This old 
Nolte role fails to hold up well. It's cut-and-dried stuff, and Inge doesn't 
even broach the reasons behind the man's crime. 
</P>
<P>
Gelfant, though, coiled and feverish, subtly catches a prisoner's loss of 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
The other principal figure in this drama is a comparatively calm black Death 
Row inmate, portrayed distinctively by Robert Doqui. 
</P>
<P>
A most affecting tintype portrait comes from Michael Berry as the burned-out 
father who visits the doomed youth. These scenes are the best written moments. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., 
through Nov. 11. $15. Free parking at rear of theater. (213) 466-1767.

A GALLERY OF MISFITS IN 'MORE INTIMACIES' AT LATC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lower case lettering on "intimacies" and "more intimacies," in repertory at 
the Los Angeles Theatre Center, is not an affectation. It's a signal, like a 
tap on a window pane, that the lives dramatized here are uncomfortably private 
matters. You watch these characters like a voyeur who comes away not sullied 
but purified. 
</P>
<P>
In Michael Kearns' new work, "more intimacies," Fernando is a flamenco dancer, 
Jesse is a black lesbian, Father Anthony has sex with boys in his parish, Mike 
is a macho hemophiliac, Dedee is married to a bisexual, Paul is deaf. Not 
people most of us know. And yet solo performer Kearns brings them all to life 
in a mercurial display. 
</P>
<P>
The show is a follow-up to Kearns' original gallery of diverse misfits, 
"intimacies,"which Kearns introduced to L.A. audiences last year. Seen back to 
back at LATC, the productions, in Kearns' writing and performance style, loom 
among the most vivid portraits of AIDS-afflicted characters. 
</P>
<P>
The term gay theater doesn't apply here. True, most of the characters grapple 
with homosexuality and are AIDS outcasts, but Kearns, who is personally active 
on the AIDS political battleground, is not a plea-bargainer or agenda-rattler 
in his art. Kearns' 12 characters (six in each show) eclipse the gay and AIDS 
lapel. He creates a Vanity Fair of loners and in a startling range of speech 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the swift, 75-minute "more intimacies," Kearns vocal accents 
shift from Latino to black to redneck to a thirtysomething woman to Italian to 
the language of the hearing-impaired (where the actor communicates in both sign 
language and the halting sounds of the hearing-disabled). 
</P>
<P>
There are no costume changes. Kearns' props are a chair and his characteristic 
red scarf, a scarf which he twists and folds into telling character details, 
including the suggestion of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
His characters' bursts of sexual imagery are raw and occasionally offensive, 
but the truth is that most of it is funny. The HIV-infected priest, talking 
about his weakness for boys in his parish, says with a tremor that "being a 
good Catholic, I didn't use a condom." 
</P>
<P>
There's a tendency for Kearns to be florid in some of the sketches. The opening 
character monologue in "more intimacies," about a Mexican flamenco dancer, a 
man conditioned to conquer the ladies but who discovers he's gay, is 
devastating in its erotic squalor. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere of "more intimacies" is indeed more "intimacies." The format is 
identical; there's no great distinction between the two shows. The characters 
are vitally different and yet cracked mirrors of one another. The technique 
alone is a case study. Kearns always knows when less is more. 
</P>
<P>
 At 514 S. Spring St., Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m. (in rep with 
"intimacies," Thursdays, 8 p.m.). Ends Nov. 15. $15; (213) 627-5599.

STRAND'S LABOR OF LOVE: WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBITION: PHOTOGRAPHER CAPTURES IMAGES OF MAN'S TIMELESS DIGNITY ON HIS 
TRAVELS AROUND THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Strand was not the sort of photographer likely to shoot a guy with his 
guard down. He was too high-minded for that. For him, the "straight," 
unretouched photograph championed by Alfred Stieglitz in the early 1900s 
offered a direct passageway into a person's soul, and he wasn't going to blow 
his chances by carelessly choosing a moment when the soul wasn't shining 
through clearly. 
</P>
<P>
No matter where his travels took him -- born in New York in 1890, he sojourned 
in New Mexico, Mexico, New England, Luzzara (in Northern Italy) and the Outer 
Hebrides in Scotland -- he found sturdy, presumably honest, working-class 
people and sturdy, honest dwelling places. In the gorgeous tonal richness of 
Strand's gelatin silver and platinum prints from the 1930s, '40s and '50s from 
the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection, every person and every humble setting 
assumes a timeless dignity. 
</P>
<P>
A boy in Tenancingo, Mexico, stands proudly on a step, his arm curving over his 
seated mother, who muses in soulful detachment. A door latch in Vermont, 
cobbled from rough, unpainted wood and old-fashioned square nails, is revealed 
as an unwitting paradigm of formal values. The piercing gaze of a wiry, 
mustached Luzzara cobbler in rolled-up shirt sleeves conveys the passionate 
life force of the "little man." A barefoot Scottish youth with a prominent hole 
in his shirt sleeve and a beaten look in his hunched shoulders stands in front 
of an unforgiving wall of stone. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the art-for-art's-sake posture of Stieglitz's circle, Strand was 
influenced by the social activism of colleagues working in theater and film. He 
contributed to a documentary about organized labor ("Native Land") and 
co-authored a book on Luzzara with Cesare Zavattini, screenwriter for Vittorio 
De Sica's landmark Neorealist film, "The Bicycle Thief." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, to a contemporary sensibility, there is something over-refined about 
Strand's approach. It is as if his subjects were scissored out of the humdrum 
flux of their lives to pose as characters in an epic drama of Strand's own 
creation. No images could be less candid than these, which makes it seem very 
odd that Strand used a concealed lens in his Graflex to fool people into 
thinking he wasn't focusing on them. Who are these people when they aren't in 
dreamy repose or brave confrontation with a camera lens? We'll never know. 
</P>
<P>
A few photographs in the show are of natural vistas without any evidence of 
human presence -- except, of course, the hyper-refined aestheticism of the 
photographer. "White Horse," an image of an animal with the brilliant, hard 
luster of marble seen against the black slope of a mountain under a dark sky, 
is surely one of the most breathtakingly lovely of these sights.

Oddball Organizations: Hearing that someone is the latest hot young Los Angeles 
artist to be recognized by the national art press is enough to set off a 
critic's hype-detector alarm. But it's easy to understand why others have found 
Greg Colson's assemblages so appealing. They combine the aw-shucks warmth of 
functional castoff objects with evidence of the artist's homespun labor and 
signs of a conceptualist's mind at work. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these pieces have to do with the systems we use to organize everyday 
experiences -- like the chart labeling the seating areas in a sports stadium, a 
map of a city's streets, the "four food groups" of nutrition lore, or even the 
different pattern shapes that must be cut out separately and sewn together to 
make a dress. Colson reproduces each of these systems in painstaking yet 
crudely rendered detail -- with hand-lettering on pasted bits of paper, tiny 
paintings or inked rubber stamps -- on shabby, humdrum objects. 
</P>
<P>
In "Tacoma," the names of streets and natural features of Tacoma, Wash., are 
rubber-stamped on the curving bottom of an old metal basin. The disjunction 
between the geographic information and the awkward -- and not exactly 
topographical -- shape of the basin draws attention to the repetition of key 
words (point, view) and the eccentric shape formed by the layout of these 
landmarks. Colson has made several pieces dealing with maps as the record of 
the piecemeal way residents gain access to different parts of a locality over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Food Groups" consists of tiny paintings -- they look like brightly colored 
children's paper stickers -- of food (a wheel of cheese, a sliced loaf of 
bread) scattered over two mail boxes and a metal lunch box. In this context, it 
seems entirely logical that the metal boxes might also be part of another 
arbitrary yet blandly down-to-earth system. Like . . . metal containers whose 
contents sustain human beings? 
</P>
<P>
Sweetly oddball as the work is, it still seems in search of a more rigorous and 
revealing way of mapping and remarking upon the methods we use to make order 
out of chaos.

'X' Marks the Spot: French artist Marie Bourget's wall-mounted installation, "X 
Positions X," looks like a cross between modular furniture displayed in a 
chi-chi home decor catalogue and a group of stick figures made from Colorforms. 
Each of the six groupings consists of four gleaming metal table bases in strict 
verticals and horizontals and a pair of table tops in matte black and shiny 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
The black squares seem to represent bodies, the table legs -- variously 
arranged in strict verticals and horizontals -- are arms and legs, and the red 
squares are objects that interact with the figures. The ensemble -- which may 
be assembled into pieces of furniture -- has a brightly energetic 
Constructivist look. But the thinking behind it remains elusive. Is the artist 
suggesting a basic kinship between the malleability of human beings and the 
easy rearrangement of objects that serve them? 
</P>
<P>
Bourget's first U.S. exhibit also includes "Transformer" -- a brightly painted 
hinged metal box on a white metal platform -- and a series of six "Tableaux." 
They are identical wood-framed wooden images of house facades, each labeled 
with a different "negative" adjective (vacant, inattentive, preoccupied, and so 
on). One hopes that the artist's idea is more complex and distinctive than 
simply comparing dwelling places to the human mind.

ON THE PREP PATH: IF GIRLS ARE GAME FOR BOYS' TEAMS, THEY DESERVE A SHOT 
</P>

<P>
There once was a girl who loved to play hopscotch. Every day, she'd hop and 
she'd scotch until she became the best girl hopscotcher around. Soon, there 
wasn't a girl who would challenge her. 
</P>
<P>
She decided to try her hopscotching skills against boys, but the adults who 
regulated hopscotching said no. 
</P>
<P>
"Girls have their own hopscotching division," they said. "There's no need for 
you to hop with the boys. Go home and knit a sweater and you'll get over it." 
</P>
<P>
The girl was puzzled. She had been taught that, if she set her mind to it, she 
could do anything she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
All she wanted was the opportunity to try to hopscotch against boys. She 
thought boys might provide better competition, and by playing against them, she 
could improve her skills. That inspired her. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," she said. "Why can't I compete with the boys?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because that's the way it is," they said. "If you want to be with the team, 
try cheerleading." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well," she shrugged, and went back to the girls' division where she soon 
became bored and quit. 
</P>
<P>
Should girls have the opportunity to try out for boys' teams -- and play on 
boys' teams -- if deemed capable? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for the same reason that women have the right to become police 
chiefs, airline pilots, CEOs and major league baseball umpires. 
</P>
<P>
Ability -- not gender -- should determine how far one gets in life, be it in 
work, education or athletics. 
</P>
<P>
In high school sports, a girl who proves herself capable of playing for a boys' 
team should be allowed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The California Interscholastic Federation allows girls to play on boys' teams, 
but only when there isn't a girls' team offered in that sport, such as water 
polo. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education has proposed a regulation that would allow 
girls to play on boys' teams if they prove themselves capable. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of this proposal -- and there are many -- have a long list of reasons 
why girls should be satisfied with the status quo: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing girls to play on boys' teams will hurt girls' athletics as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents believe that if girls were allowed on boys' teams, all the top female 
athletes would rush to join the boys, leaving girls' sports in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
First, let's be realistic. AThere are probably not vast numbers of girls 
capable of competing on the boys' level. That's not to say the boys' teams are 
better, necessarily, but they are undoubtedly packed with players stronger and 
quicker than most girls. 
</P>
<P>
And who is to say that top female athletes will even want to play on boys' 
teams? Many will be happy to stay where they are. 
</P>
<P>
But will girls' sports suffer? 
</P>
<P>
Doubtful. Sure, the loss of a Cheryl Miller-type player will hurt a girls' 
basketball team for a season or two. But the underlying response will be an 
overall improvement in girls' sports. 
</P>
<P>
Just as weaker teams must find ways to improve, girls' sports will also find 
ways to get better and attract more girls. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic directors and coaches of girls' teams, under the threat of losing 
their top players, will work that much harder to provide what is needed -- 
prestige, top competition, excellent coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is better for top female athletes to stay on girls' teams because they 
serve as role models for younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, and top women secretaries should remain secretaries and not strive to be 
CEOs. 
</P>
<P>
A girl who has the ability and drive to compete against the boys is a role 
model for other girls. And other boys. Respect goes to those who strive to be 
their best, no matter the situation. 
</P>
<P>
* If girls want better competition, they can find it by playing on 
out-of-season club competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, how nice. We won't let girls play on boys' high school teams but we will 
let them -- encourage them even -- to pay money and spend extra time playing 
for a club team. 
</P>
<P>
* In sports such as soccer and basketball, girls might get hurt playing against 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 This will undoubtedly be one of the major arguments. Boys, not wanting to be 
shown up, might play rough. But girls who are strong enough to compete against 
boys will take this into consideration. Besides, girls can hurt playing against 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls' sports have come so far, why jeopardize what we already have? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they've come a long way, baby. 
</P>
<P>
Girls no longer compete in the cave-woman era of Girls' Athletic Assn. They no 
longer wear bloomers. They no longer have "play days" instead of full-fledged 
athletic contests. They no longer are ignored by the media. 
</P>
<P>
Is that to say they should be satisfied? 
</P>
<P>
No. 
</P>
<P>
Being allowed to play on boys' teams would be the next -- and the most logical 
-- step toward the overall aim, equality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TWO SETS OF STANDARDS 
</P>
<P>
The potential conflict of standards between the state Board of Education and 
the CIF concerning girls' participation in interscholastic sports: 
</P>
<P>
Rule from regulations being considered by the state Board of Education: 
</P>
<P>
"A female student shall be permitted to try out for and participate on an 
all-male team if she meets the objective, competitive skill requirements to 
participate, even though a female team exists in the same sport." 
</P>
<P>
From Article 2 of the CIF bylaws: 
</P>
<P>
200 (a) STUDENT TEAM -- Whenever the school provides only a team or teams for 
boys in a particular sport, girls are permitted to qualify for the student 
team(s). 
</P>
<P>
(b) BOYS' TEAM -- Whenever the school provides a team or teams for boys and a 
team or teams for girls in the same sport, girls shall not be permitted to 
qualify for the boys' team(s) in that sport, nor shall boys be permitted to 
qualify the girls' team(s) in that sport. 
</P>
<P>
(c) GIRLS' TEAM -- Whenever the school provides only a team or teams for girls 
in a particular sport, boys shall not be permitted to qualify for the girls' 
team in that sport unless opportunities in the total sports program for boys in 
the school has been limited in comparison to the total sports program for girls 
in that school. Permission for boys to qualify for a girls' team must be 
secured through petition by the school principal to the State CIF Federated 
Council.

It took a little while, but the Corona del Mar girls' volleyball team made sure 
youth was served Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, ranked second nationally by Volleyball Monthly and second in 
Orange County, overcame a slow start to cruise past Newport Harbor, 6-15, 15-3, 
15-6, 15-11, in a Sea View League game at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Lara Carlsen had 13 kills and Stacy Petersen added seven as the Sea Kings 
(14-1, 5-0 in league play) had 12 aces. 
</P>
<P>
Tara Kroesch had eight kills and two aces for Newport Harbor (9-4, 3-2), which 
lost its second consecutive match. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's Jennifer Glueck caught Corona del Mar by surprise in the first 
game. She had three aces to spark a 13-1 run as the Sailors overcame a 5-2 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out like we normally do but Jenny came in and served those 
cross-court rockets," Corona del Mar Coach Dale Flickinger said. "But we turned 
it around." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsen and Petersen each had three kills in the second game, and the Sea Kings 
combined for 10 aces, including three by Karin Graves, to win the final two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said his team couldn't stop Corona del Mar's 
serving. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a young team (only two seniors) and we knew Corona del Mar wasn't going 
to fall apart after the first game with all the seniors it had," Glenn said. 
"Corona del Mar's a fun team to watch, but it's not much fun to coach against 
them." MIKE REILLEY

Jerry Gray saw the chance to strike back, to deliver the counterpunch that 
might finally set the Rams' opponents back on their heels for a change, that 
one stunning blow that could change the momentum of his team's staggering fall 
from grace. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the first quarter Sunday night against the Bears, Gray took his shot. 
He sprinted in front of Chicago running back Neal Anderson in an attempt to 
intercept a pass from quarterback Jim Harbaugh. Gray was in position to steal 
the ball and sprint 60 yards to give his team something they hadn't had in more 
than a month . . . an early lead. First blood. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, the ball got through his outstretched arms, however, and reached 
Anderson, who carried it 32 yards to the Rams' 13-yard line. Three plays later, 
Harbaugh hooked up with Anderson for a touchdown that put the Bears up, 7-0. 
And a little more than 21 minutes of play later, Chicago led, 31-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not making any plays on defense," Gray said. "It wasn't a big play, 
just intercept the ball. I thought I had it. I tipped it, but (Anderson) had 
the concentration to catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, that's only one little play, but those little things can make a 
difference. Someone has to make a play on defense. We have a good team, but 
we're just not fighting like a good team." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, once considered one of the most physical teams in the league, have 
looked like a punch-drunk club boxer this season. They've certainly absorbed a 
lot more punishment than they've been able to dish out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the ones getting hit right now," Coach John Robinson said. "It's like 
the fighter who comes out and gets punched in the mouth and you say, 'Man, that 
guy's not very nasty. Except for the cut on his mouth, now that's nasty.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you got the (crap) kicked out of you by the guy's left hook, then you come 
out the next round and the trainer's yelling, 'Look out for the left hook.' But 
it gets to the point where you have to hit him in the mouth. And that's what 
we're telling our players. Hit him. But they're still ducking from the left 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just an attitude. It's a matter of being more of a naturally 
aggressive player as opposed to somebody who's always on the lookout." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and his coaching staff spent extra time in the film room trying to 
find reasons for the Rams' lack of defensive vigor. They scrutinized every play 
-- and the effort of every player -- but weren't able to find any answers. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't make that many mistakes in this game, we just didn't make anything 
happen," he said. "And that's typical of where we're at right now. We're just 
not making anything at all happen defensively. If we're there and the other 
guy's there and the ball is thrown, the other guy catches it and we make the 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"As you look at the film, you don't come away saying, 'This guy was awful,' or, 
'This guy played terrible,' or 'This guy's not trying.' You just say, 
'Nothing's happening.' And that includes players we all perceive to be very 
good players. We have to concentrate on playing with intensity. We have to 
fight our way out of it." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to remedy the situation, Robinson says he will pick up the pace on 
the practice field, encouraging more physical and spirited workouts. But he 
also intends to work on his team's shaken psyche in an effort to snap them out 
of what he calls "the fog that has enveloped us." 
</P>
<P>
"You want to say, 'Will this please go away?' But we're clearly in a place 
where we have to do something to make it go away," he said. "It isn't a 
nightmare. There's a real tendency to say, 'If I close my eyes and open them 
again, it'll be gone.' But it ain't that way, man." 
</P>
<P>
Safety Vince Newsome, in his eighth year with the Rams, says the time for 
self-analysis is over. He believes the veterans have to take the initiative and 
adopt that slogan made so popular by a footwear firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we lost four straight and everybody jumped off the bandwagon," 
Newsome said. "Then we just had the Rams. We're back to that point again and 
again we have to dig down deep and just do it.

COMPCARE CORP. CUTTING ITS LOSSES WITH 550 LAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: PROVIDER OF CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY PROGRAMS SAYS THE COMPANYWIDE 
TRIMS WILL INCLUDE 55 JOBS AT ITS COSTA MESA AND ORANGE HOSPITALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to reduce its losses, the new management of Comprehensive Care 
Corp., one of the nation's largest providers of chemical dependency programs, 
has begun the elimination of 550 positions nationwide, including 55 at its two 
hospitals in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
CompCare Chief Executive James P. Carmany, who in August led a proxy battle 
that ousted the company's board of directors, said the companywide layoffs 
began 45 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, CompCare plans to reduce its work force to 1,650 people from 
2,200 when the layoffs started. The company operates 15 medical facilities in 
11 states. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of 179 positions at two CompCare treatment centers in Orange County 
-- Starting Point of Orange County in Costa Mesa and Care Unit Hospital in 
Orange -- either have been or will be cut by the end of 1990, Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was CompCare's corporate headquarters until the company moved to 
St. Louis last year. 
</P>
<P>
Carmany said the Orange County cuts are being achieved, in part, by combining 
the administrative operations of the two hospitals and putting them under a 
single executive director. The former Irvine corporate office was closed, said 
Carmany, who still maintains a small executive staff in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
He said some nursing jobs were eliminated at the company's Orange County 
facilities, which he said are only 40% utilized. "We tried our best to maintain 
the hands-on clinical staff at appropriate levels for all forms of treatment," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carmany said the cost-cutting efforts will reduce operating costs by an 
estimated 23% and "get us close to break even." The company lost $61.2 million 
for its fiscal year ended May 31 and nearly $7.5 million in the first quarter 
of its current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides approving the layoffs, CompCare's new directors earlier this month 
approved a plan to increase the company's revenues. "We are beefing up our 
marketing and business development and looking to more effectively use the 
assets we have," Carmany said.

<P>
Two Newport Beach stockbrokers, facing an industry with fewer customers and 
smaller commissions, figured that they could come up with a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald H. Klein and Charles G. Salisbury left their jobs at Prudential-Bache 
Securities to start Holford Securities Inc., a discount, full-service brokerage 
in Irvine, on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, sending the stock 
market in a tailspin and nearly destroying Holford. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Klein's and Salisbury's former Prudential-Bache customers were nervous 
over the invasion and decided that they did not want to switch to the new firm. 
And, of course, some customers even left the market. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury acknowledged this week that Holford Securities was hit harder than he 
and Klein anticipated, "and the market has not cooperated with us at all." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, the company has enough capital to weather the storm and 
expects to break even by the end of the year, which is about twice as long as 
the two had anticipated it would take to reach the break-even point. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, Salisbury and three other sales people are promoting Holford in Leisure 
World, the gated retirement community in Laguna Hills, and elsewhere in South 
Orange County. By offering discounts of 40% to 70% on commissions, they hope to 
attract customers to their offices in the Irvine Spectrum.

<P>
A federal judge Tuesday ordered a hearing to determine whether he should lower 
the $5-million bail set for Charles H. Keating Jr., who has been jailed since 
he was indicted a month ago on state charges of securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies scheduled the hearing for 
1:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Davies' decision came after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
filed documents that said Keating's bail should not be reduced or lifted 
because of the seriousness of the criminal charges and other legal actions give 
him "a strong motive to flee." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who has been jailed since Sept. 18, had gone through the state 
appellate system seeking a review of the bail amount. A state Court of Appeal 
panel refused to lower bail, and the state Supreme Court refused to hear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, 66, is the former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, 
which owned Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. The company filed for 
bankruptcy in April, 1989; federal thrift regulators seized Lincoln the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators say Lincoln is one of the nation's worst S&amp;L disasters and 
estimate that it will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion to clean up the 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold nearly $200 million in junk bonds through Lincoln's 29 
Southern California branches, and the small investors who bought the bonds say 
they were misled into believing that the bonds were safe and federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-count indictment accuses Keating and three others of providing investors 
with false and misleading information and violating other state laws in selling 
the bonds, which have become worthless since the collapse of the company and 
the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
A trial is scheduled Nov. 26, but both the Los Angeles County Superior Court 
trial judge and defense attorneys said they doubt that a trial could begin that 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
In his federal court petition, Keating claimed that the $5-million bail set by 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner is excessive and beyond reach. Keating, who 
just three years ago was worth nearly $40 million, now claims to be broke. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors responded that the bail is not excessive, even if Keating cannot 
afford it. They said he has had access to huge sums in the past and could try 
to tap into those sources in order to flee. 
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of the offense in this case sets it apart from other cases and 
justifies a bail setting higher than that which is customary in other cases," 
the prosecutors said.

FIRM HANDLING MCENROE ESCROW ACCUSED; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE COMPANY VEHEMENTLY DENIES WRONGDOING. IT CHALLENGED REGULATORS 
BY PURSUING THE CASE TO SUPERIOR COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
California regulators are accusing another Encino escrow firm, Pavilion Escrow 
Inc., of breaking state laws while handling several real estate deals, 
including the $3.6-million sale of tennis star John McEnroe's house in the 
exclusive Carbon Beach area of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint before the Department of Corporations (DOC), Corporations 
Commissioner Christine W. Bender has alleged that Pavilion, among other things, 
opened two different escrows on McEnroe's house early this year without telling 
McEnroe or getting his approval -- in violation of state financial laws. 
McEnroe eventually sold the house in May. 
</P>
<P>
But Pavilion vehemently denies any wrongdoing, and aggressively challenged the 
DOC by taking the case to Superior Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the McEnroe case, Pavilion asserts that the two escrows were merely a 
paperwork oversight. Both escrows involved the same buyer and seller, and it 
was "physically impossible" for McEnroe to not have approved the situation 
because he signed the instructions for both escrows, Joseph S. Fischbach, a 
lawyer for Pavilion, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, neither McEnroe -- who had bought the house from Johnny Carson -- nor 
anyone else has filed a complaint about Pavilion with the DOC or brought a 
lawsuit in court, Fischbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome J. Eisenberg, a former lawyer for Pavilion, said in court papers that 
"all the parties were advised of the nature of the transaction and simply 
forgot to cancel" the first escrow. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations stated by the DOC are frivolous and clearly demonstrate their 
inability to understand complex transactions," Eisenberg stated. 
</P>
<P>
Escrow firms, which must be licensed by the state, help ensure that buyers and 
sellers of real estate meet certain conditions, such as obtaining a title 
search, before the sale is completed. In effect, they stand as a neutral party, 
holding documents and cash transferred between the buyer and seller until the 
deal is closed. Frequently, each side is required to make a deposit of at least 
a few thousand dollars to open escrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Pavilion case points up how the DOC is looking closely at escrow firms 
since early last year, when the agency seized the now-defunct Escrow Shoppe, 
another Encino firm. The DOC closed it after alleging that the Escrow Shoppe 
made unauthorized payments totaling $3 million, and asserting that up to 
$450,000 was missing. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, the DOC was heavily criticized by some of the Escrow Shoppe's 
customers because the DOC also froze $5 million of customers' money for several 
months while its investigation continued, which threw the customers' housing 
plans into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pavilion case, however, none of the complaints by Bender involve missing 
funds or customers being deprived of cash they were due. 
</P>
<P>
She did allege that Pavilion altered escrow instructions, failed to disclose 
important information to lenders and let its former lawyer, Eisenberg, draw 
cash from Pavilion's bank account without first telling regulators. In court 
papers, Pavilion called all the allegations false and, on the Eisenberg matter, 
said he only had access to the firm's "general" bank account, not the "trust" 
account where customers' escrow funds are held. 
</P>
<P>
The DOC's complaints were made on June 20 and co-signed by Judy L. Hartley, a 
senior counsel at the DOC in Los Angeles who declined comment on the case. The 
agency also said then that it planned to revoke Pavilion's escrow license and 
to bar its sole owner, Deidre Nulty, from the business pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the DOC tried to block Pavilion from accepting any new 
business because "we thought the danger to the public was so great," said Alan 
S. Weinger, a DOC lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
But Pavilion convinced a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles to block the DOC's 
order stopping Pavilion from taking on new accounts, because Pavilion had not 
been given due process to defend itself. Pavilion today continues operating as 
normal under Nulty's supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Pavilion also tried to get a court order blocking the DOC from pursuing its 
intention to shut Pavilion down, but Pavilion lost that round. So the parties 
are scheduled to argue the matter before an administrative law judge Nov. 6.

'CALIFORNIA IMPRESSIONISM' NEVER MADE THE BIG TIME, AND A LOOK AT ITS ARTISTS' 
WORKS DEMONSTRATES WHY.

<P>
There have been moments in history when agroup of creative visionaries have put 
their hometown on the cultural map. More commonly, provincial art styles 
beloved by the locals never make the big time, and for good reason. So-called 
"California Impressionism" is one of those styles, a timidly conservative 
attempt to capture the look of a coastal Shangri-La using techniques pioneered 
by artists in France more than a generation earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Granting the continuing public popularity of these paintings, a critic 
nevertheless groans at the prospect of yet another show devoted to uninspired 
images of breezy shores, rugged mountains and dreamily idle women. The 
"masters" of this genre hardly seem worth differentiating from each other, and 
they scarcely suffer from underexposure. 
</P>
<P>
So why is the Laguna Art Museum bringing us "California Light: 1900-1930," an 
array of 75 works by nine of these artists? 
</P>
<P>
Well, initially it seemed as though the exhibit (on view through Jan. 6, 1991) 
was going to offer a fresh, broadly sociological look at the connection between 
the art and the sun-dazzled land that rapidly was filling up with newcomers 
lured by tourist brochures. Even ho-hum art can be wonderfully informative 
about the habits and beliefs of people living at a particular time. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue essays by 10 authors with expertise in a variety of fields do 
cover a good deal of ground, from the phenomenon of migration to Southern 
California to the way certain artists glorified a vision of passive femininity. 
Yet guest curator Patricia Trenton seems to be bringing us the same old show, 
livened up with a few informational tidbits about the unique whiteness of 
California light. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling through the exhibit, you don't feel you're in the midst of a 
revisionist effort, or even a concerted effort to relate art to life. 
Conventional documentation of the careers of the artists -- most of whom also 
worked abroad and back East -- tends to cloud the issue of how the art 
responded to the social and cultural climate of California. There are no 
contemporary photographs to give a sense of context, no relevant wall-text 
discussions of, say, the emphasis on light and color in what passed for 
critical writing on art in Southern California, or the amount of leisure time 
enjoyed by upper-class women of the period. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings -- by Franz Bischoff, Maurice Braun, Alson Clark, Joseph 
Kleitsch, Edgar Payne, Granville Redmond, Guy Rose, Donna Schuster and William 
Wendt -- are grouped for the most part by artist. A separate gallery is set 
aside for works painted in Europe by Rose, Clark and Payne, presumably to 
indicate the different kinds of light they found in Madrid, Paris, Switzerland 
and Giverny, where aging Impressionist Claude Monet held court. 
</P>
<P>
Although California Impressionism marked the last hurrah of plein-air painting 
-- done out-of-doors to capture instantaneous effects at the source -- the 
Californians went their own independent ways, frequently distorting or 
modifying the working habits and theories of their French artistic forebears. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Payne, for example, really was an academic painter in Impressionist's 
clothing. He stayed indoors to paint detailed models of fishing boats in 
Impressionist-style broken brushwork, and carefully recomposed his outdoor 
sketches of mountains into idealized visions instead of trying to capture the 
fleeting quality of optical sensations. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, quite a few of the works on view are scenes of light held at bay by 
parasols and porticoes, or filtered into indoor settings. Based on the evidence 
in these canvases, the only people who took shelter under a roof in California 
were women. With a few exceptions -- like Kleitsch's portrait of self-possessed 
"Miss Ketchum" -- these lasses were a droopy lot, given to vague reveries in 
pretty gowns amid the tasteful furnishings of a prosperous home. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, as in Clark's "Reflections" -- a semi-nude image of a young thing 
staring smugly at her manicure -- the woman poses near a mirror but doesn't 
look into it. The mirror, like the woman, is really there for the spectator's 
pleasure in sensual accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
As Bram Dijkstra, professor of American literature and cultural history at UC 
San Diego, discusses at length in a catalogue essay, in turn-of-the-century 
painting a woman was "a clever optical illusion . . . lit only by the reflected 
light of the masculine sun . . . a mere echo of creativity." Such insights and 
turns of phrase rescue the exhibit from the doldrums; if only the same could be 
said of the paintings themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "California Light: 1900-1930" continues through Jan. 6, 1991, at the Laguna 
Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive in Laguna Beach. Gallery hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission: $2 general, $1 seniors and students, free

SEEDS YIELD ALBUM FOR LOS LOBOS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: 'NEIGHBORHOOD' BAND WILL PLAY SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO THURSDAY NIGHT. 
</P>

Some fine, strong things can grow from some mighty small seeds, and Los Lobos' 
current album, "The Neighborhood," is nearly a literal case in point. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lobos drummer Louie Perez, there was a time early in the writing 
stages of the album when he and David Hidalgo, his writing partner, were 
floundering in the wake of the band's soundtrack version of "La Bamba." 
Unexpectedly to them, it had hit No. 1, and "David and I found ourselves kind 
of going crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were blocked up, trying to figure out what direction to go," Perez recalled 
from a tour stop in San Francisco last week. "I'd close myself up in my 
workroom, and when my wife would sometimes stick her arm in to deliver the 
mail, I'd look up and give her one of those 
Phantom-of-the-Opera-tears-his-mask-off glares. 
</P>
<P>
"We contribute regularly to a number of different charities," Perez said, "and 
one day my wife dared to walk in the room a second time to show me this little 
thank-you gift from the St. John of God School for Special Children. It was a 
little packet of seeds that said, 'Thank you for helping our flowers grow.' 
</P>
<P>
"She set it right in front of me, and that was it," he said. "I cleared the 
desk and said, 'OK, I have to write something for me, without any of this 
concept or records or anything.' I wrote it, gave David the tape, and the next 
day around noon he dropped off the finished demo of 'Little John of God,' 
sounding just like it does on the record. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really good thing for us. That was the song that told us: 'What are 
we doing here? Let's do what feels right,' " Perez continued. "And we moved on 
from there. Here we were trying to be these guys doing everything that's the 
right way to follow up a big hit record, to write something people could hear 
on the radio, and all that went right out the window." 
</P>
<P>
What flew in was a luminous, heart-filled ballad, performed with an assurance 
and simplicity that enfold the whole of "The Neighborhood." The East L.A.-bred 
quintet (Perez, guitarist-singers Hidalgo and Cesar Rosas, bassist Conrad 
Lozano and saxman Steve Berlin, who was added in the 1980s) has talent aplenty 
to rampage through a gamut of North American musical styles, yet the album 
displays a band with nothing to prove and everything to share. 
</P>
<P>
In places, such as the title track, the group still addresses social issues 
directly. Elsewhere, perhaps the most daring thing about the album is a 
willingness to be simple. A prime example is the exuberant party rocker 
"Jenny's Got a Pony," with lyrics that never get more complex than "Jenny's got 
a pony so Jenny can ride and ride." Like the best early rock, it doesn't rely 
on an overt, critic-ready lyric to explain that the song is about hope. 
Instead, the spirit with which it is played practically embodies hope. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote 'Jenny's Got a Pony' with the idea that it be like a song you'd hear 
kids sing on the schoolyard while playing hopscotch," Perez explained. "Those 
are hard songs to write, man. It's hard to write a happy song. I admire Chuck 
Berry so much. He could write a song that really meant something without 
seeming to -- 'Brown-Eyed Handsome Man'! They hit home in such a simple way, 
where even the most frivolous thing really meant something to you in some way." 
</P>
<P>
In terse strokes, the song "The Neighborhood" paints a vision of the ways 
everyone in a family is affected by the decay of an old neighborhood; the song 
ends in a prayer for peace and serenity. Though Perez said he hopes the song 
addresses universal concerns, it was inspired by the changing life in the 
section of East Los Angeles where the band used to live. 
</P>
<P>
Perez and Hidalgo now live in an older section of Whittier. He describes his 
block as a place full of people who "whether they know you or not, smile and 
say hello. It's the way East L.A. used to be," he said, "which has changed 
quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the process of moving my mother out of the house I grew up in, which 
originally belonged to my grandfather," Perez said. "I can go back there right 
now and go out in the back yard and like find a rock that has been there since 
I was a little kid. It's sad that I have to move her out of there, but she's 
got to have bars on the windows now, and a chain-link fence. Everything's 
creeping up on the old turf. There's a lot of the stuff you can't get away from 
on the news -- the violence and drugs and all. 
</P>
<P>
"And things had just started looking positive for a while," he said. "When a 
lot of people like myself were growing up there, and had to make choices for 
ourselves, at the time there was this Chicano renaissance and this thing with 
Mexican-American studies and this 'new pride' sort of thing. Some of us were 
able to go on as a result of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos have gone on to become one of rock's most critically praised bands. 
Ironically, its long ascent began nearly two decades ago with the group 
abandoning rock, to instead explore its members' acoustic folk heritage. Then, 
after years of playing weddings, benefits and social events in their community, 
they took up their electric instruments again and became a force in the early 
'80s Hollywood scene, which included X and the Blasters. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, their Latino influences have mixed with an authoritative command of 
Western swing, blues, zydeco and other roots sources, sometimes defining fresh 
musical territories, as with the current album's Mexican folk-style 
huapango-rock hybrid "Be Still." 
</P>
<P>
In the moment of fame that followed "La Bamba," the band re-immersed itself in 
its traditional roots once more, and came up with 1988's acoustic, 
Spanish-language "La Pistola y el Corazon" album. " 'La Bamba' scared us a 
little. We had to wonder 'What have we become?' That's when we dug way deep and 
dug out 'La Pistola,' " Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a way for us to reaffirm a lot of the things that excited us about 
playing music, and ultimately we became friends again," Perez said. "Not that 
we weren't, but we were taking a lot of things for granted amid all the madness 
and success. We became buddies again, hanging out at Cesar's house every day, 
going through songs on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like finding a trunk in the attic and going through it, discovering all 
those memories," he said. "It was therapeutic, a spirit-cleansing experience. 
'The Neighborhood' is the result of all those experiences and of the peace, 
hope and faith we got from sharing with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to express that hope and the need for peace, whether it be inner peace 
or the cessation of war, world peace," Perez said. "That peace is something we 
talked about for a long time but never came right out and said was what we were 
looking for. That's certainly what I've been looking for, some peace in my 
life, and I've been able to get a little of that. I became sober after the 
first of this year, after quite a little bit of a battle with alcoholism. A lot 
of this stuff just comes out of trying to make sense of your life. And I think 
that permeates the record." 
</P>
<P>
Now Los Lobos is paying the price of being so true to itself. Radio has all but 
ignored "The Neighborhood" album, which so far hasn't even broken the Top 100 
of the Billboard pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to tell you this is a tough time for a band like ours to tour and 
be putting a record out. With everything that's been going on politically and 
economically and the way the industry and radio is formatted, bands like us are 
pushed out into oblivion almost," said Perez. "It's a tough one for us to stay 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he is content with the choices the band has made. 
</P>
<P>
"What's really cool is my wife sent a letter to the priest who runs the St. 
John of God school, and he wrote back saying: 'Even though I've never heard of 
your husband's group, this sounds wonderful. I'm looking forward to hearing 
it.' Then after the record came out, he called the office a week ago and said 
he was absolutely at a loss for words and he was thrilled and said it was going 
to become their school song. On the tour now we're going to stop off and visit 
them during a day off. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the action the album gets is just this one phone call from this little 
old Irish priest in New Jersey, that's enough. I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Lobos plays Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25. Information: (714) 496-8930.

"I'm intrigued with the process of random occurrence," says George Geyer, who 
often uses his seemingly favorite phrase in the titles of his works, such as 
"Architectural Fragment of Random Occurrence." Fifteen of his new pieces, 
including architecturally and geologically inspired works composed of broken 
glass and granite, are on view here through Nov. 4 at the Works Gallery South. 
</P>
<P>
"Your brain can only go so far," says the artist, who randomly breaks his 
materials with a hammer before gluing them back together into finished pieces. 
"If you can remain calm enough to go with that process of random occurrence, to 
go with whatever happens, then maybe you can come up with something innovative, 
more interesting and . . . more human." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer, 55, a trained ceramist who is also currently featured in USC's 
"Forbidden Entry" exhibition in Los Angeles with his "Floating Corridor of 
Forbidden Entry" installation, says the ideas for his new works came about as a 
result of the earthquake that rocked Southern California in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost three pieces in that earthquake," says Geyer, whose work was on show at 
the time in the Works Gallery's Long Beach space. "They crashed and were 
destroyed, and I was devastated, but I thought, rather than just putting them 
in the trash bin, why not just use this and put them back together all broken? 
So I did, and they were more beautiful and interesting than when they weren't 
broken. . . . And they sold immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer says he likes not having any control over how the fragmented works come 
out but noted that he throws away probably 70% of the glass he works with. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Geyer's works are broken, however. Some, such as "Double Jeopardy," 
which has two thin, ceiling-high panes of fan-blown moving and bendable glass, 
only appear as if they are about to break. 
</P>
<P>
"I like danger and risk," says Geyer, who also uses art-historical references 
in his work. One such piece is "Floating Red Square on Fragment," in which a 
streaked red clay image is painted onto broken glass. Geyer did the work, he 
says, as a nod to three of his favorite artists: Marcel Duchamp (who used 
broken glass) and Josef Albers and Kazimir Malevich (both of whom incorporated 
squares in their works). 
</P>
<P>
 Works by George Geyer are on view through Nov. 4 at the Works Gallery South in 
Crystal Court, 3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. Hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays 
through Fridays; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays.

'INTELLECTUAL BUT LOUD' JANE USES PAIN IN PATTER

Have you noticed how mechanized modern life has become? Martha Jane has. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm desperate, I call the hot line. I dial (800) 976-NUTS, and I get this 
special recording," she says, assuming friendly, operator-like tones: "If you 
want to kill a family member or a close neighbor, press or dial 1. If you're a 
victim of a multiple personality, press 2, 3, 4, and 5. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Boston-born, 6-foot-tall, red-haired comedian, who plays the recurring role 
of Mrs. Luby on the TV series "Lenny," will appear at the Laff Stop in Newport 
Beach tonight and Friday through Sunday on a bill headlined by Tim Jones. 
</P>
<P>
She has been described as a cross between Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words," she says, "I'm intellectual but loud." 
</P>
<P>
Like many comedians, she prefers to tap personal experiences in writing her 
act. "There's that famous Lenny Bruce quote when he goes into the Chinese 
restaurant and the waiter says, 'It's too bad about your divorce.' Lenny says, 
'Yeah, but I needed 10 new minutes.' 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about comedy," Jane continues, "is you can channel intense pain into 
very funny bits. Those are the things that people relate to the most. If you 
talk about shopping at the mall, that's cute but it's not meaningful. When I do 
the joke about the hot line, a lot of people are feeling intense pain and 
depression, and everywhere you go things are mechanized. You have to be on hold 
just to talk to a recording." 
</P>
<P>
Jane has appeared on such syndicated TV shows as "Comic Strip Live" and "Comedy 
Express." Under Special Skills on her resume, she lists dancing, various and 
sundry dialects and pie throwing. There's one credit under Recordings: Backup 
screaming on Sam Kinison's "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
Her comedy heroes include Tomlin, Jackie Gleason and Margaret Dumont (Groucho 
Marx's movie foil). She apparently inherited her love of comedy from her 
father: "Even though everyone in my family went to college and is very 
intellectual, my dad would actually say 'OK, kids, put down your homework, 
Jonathan Winters is on.' " 
</P>
<P>
A modern-dance major at Harvard, Jane moved to Los Angeles in 1978, where she 
did a "variety of dumb office jobs" and wrote unproduced screenplays for 
musicals "with lots of dancing in them. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody read one of my screenplays and said, 'You should do comedy.' So I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy being a female comic, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for women," she says, recalling the time six years ago 
when she called a club owner to say she'd like to send him a tape of her act. 
The owner wasn't interested. "We had a woman in here last year," he said, "but 
she didn't do very well." 
</P>
<P>
"They all worry we're going to tell emasculating jokes, which is so silly," 
Jane says. 
</P>
<P>
One of her favorite stories is of the time back in the early '80s when she was 
just starting, and she was booked into a club for a week. She did quite well on 
opening night but received a call from the club the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were going to pay me for the whole week, but don't come back. I 
was devastated," she recalls. "I was in tears, crying all the way over to pick 
up the money." 
</P>
<P>
Jane asked the woman who worked for the club owner why he fired her. "Your act 
is great," the woman said, "but you look exactly like the owner's ex-wife, and 
he can't stand the sight of you." 
</P>
<P>
The club finally went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," Jane says, "a lot of people look like his ex-wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Jane and Tim Jones perform Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Friday at 8:30 and 
10:30 p.m., Saturday at 8, 10 and 11:45 p.m. and Sunday at 8:30 p.m. at the 
Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. Bristol St., Newport Beach. Admission: $7 to $10.

TESTIMONY STARTS ON OPEN-LAND TRANSFER;

INVESTIGATION: TWO FORMER LAGUNA NIGUEL OFFICIALS INSTRUMENTAL IN SIGN-OVER OF 
96 ACRES OF OPEN SPACE TO A DEVELOPER MAY BE UNDER SPECIAL SCRUTINY. OTHERS

<P>
Prosecutors on Tuesday stepped up the criminal probe into the transfer of 
control over 96 acres of open space to a South County developer and called key 
figures in the 1988 transaction before the Orange County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the local and county officials were summoned by subpoena to 
appear as witnesses, two former Laguna Niguel officials were notified of the 
proceedings by letter -- but not subpoenaed -- indicating their conduct may be 
under special scrutiny by the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the probe is a February, 1988, deed that transferred control of 
the 96 acres bordering the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park to the developer 
of the Marina Hills Planned Community. At issue is whether the land -- set 
aside for public use -- was legally transferred. 
</P>
<P>
In daylong proceedings, county land planners carted in a cardboard box of 
documents, while top Laguna Niguel city officials, appearing in response to 
subpoenas, paced the hallways waiting to be called before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Former Laguna Niguel Community Service District Manager James S. Mocalis and 
the district board's attorney, James S. Okazaki, were offered an opportunity to 
voluntarily appear before the grand jury, instead of being subpoenaed, their 
attorney confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said that such letters usually indicate that 
recipients are considered potential suspects in a criminal investigation and 
that prosecutors do not want to jeopardize their rights by forcing them to 
testify under subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney for Mocalis and Okazaki -- prominent Santa Ana criminal 
defense lawyer Allan Stokke -- rejected any suggestion that his clients were 
targets of the grand jury probe. "There is no statement (in the letter) that he 
is a target," he said, referring to the letter to Okazaki. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis did not appear at the proceedings. Okazaki came with Stokke, who, met 
with Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade in the hallway outside the grand jury 
room and then told reporters his clients will testify at later proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time I'm talking with Wally Wade," Stokke said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade declined to make any comment on the grand jury proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki, silver-haired, slight and bespectacled, initially talked with 
reporters, telling them he was "exceedingly surprised" that the criminal 
investigation launched last spring has progressed to grand jury proceedings. 
The brief interview was broken up by Stokke, who said his client would decline 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
More than six months ago, the district attorney began investigating events 
surrounding a deed, dated Feb. 11, 1988, which relinquished public control of 
96 acres, previously set aside as open space, to Taylor Woodrow Homes 
California Ltd. The land bordering the regional park is now part of the Marina 
Hills subdivision and the site of about 100 homes, with more planned. 
</P>
<P>
The deed was signed by Mocalis and then-district vice president (and now city 
councilman) James F. Krembas and was prepared and notarized by Okazaki. 
</P>
<P>
Since questions first surfaced surrounding the land transfer, Taylor Woodrow 
Homes has maintained that the transaction was approved by both county and local 
officials and that Krembas' signature on the deed was only ministerial. 
</P>
<P>
Two top officials with the county's Environmental Management Agency -- Park 
Planning chief Eric Jessen and senior land planner Al Garrotto -- were the 
lead-off witnesses at the grand jury proceedings. Garrotto, who wheeled a box 
of documents into the grand jury room, would say only that the records were "to 
back me up." 
</P>
<P>
Jessen, who has said in earlier interviews that county officials were 
"horrified" by the land transfer, declined all comment. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki and Mocalis have said they prepared the deed at the direction of a 
unanimous vote by the Community Service District, which administered local 
public land before Laguna Niguel incorporated as a city in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But Krembas has said he signed the deed under the mistaken belief it was part 
of another transaction. All other district board members -- three of whom have 
been subpoenaed to testify -- have said they were unaware of the transfer and 
would not have approved it. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas, who has also been subpoenaed to testify, had initially been considered 
a focus of the probe in part because his wife was hired by Taylor Woodrow homes 
as a sales executive three months after the land transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas has maintained that his wife's employment by Taylor Woodrow Homes was 
only a coincidence. He said Tuesday that she was laid off recently from her 
position as a regional sales manager because of the downturn in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's decision to subpoena Krembas, rather than send him a special 
"target" letter, would indicate he is not now considered a focus of the 
criminal probe. Krembas, who testified late Tuesday, said he has never 
considered himself a suspect in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even sought or gotten legal advice," Krembas said in an interview 
before he testified. "There was never any reason to." 
</P>
<P>
Other former or current local officials subpoenaed to the grand jury Tuesday 
included Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates, Councilman Paul M. Christiansen 
and developer James Smith, all of whom served on the district board at the time 
of the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said she had been instructed not to discuss her testimony. Christiansen, 
who said he will return Thursday to testify, also declined to discuss his 
upcoming testimony but said he was pleased that the grand jury proceedings had 
finally begun. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen, frequently at odds with Krembas, has been the City Council's most 
outspoken critic of the land transfer. "I find it extremely refreshing that the 
process seems to be working -- that the facts are going to come out," 
Christiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing before the grand jury was Laguna Niguel City Clerk Juanita 
Zarilla, who is scheduled to complete her testimony today. Zarilla, who was 
asked to verify official city documents Tuesday, is expected to be asked today 
about a board resolution drafted by Okazaki and signed by Mocalis in early 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution indicates that the board approved the land transfer by a 4-0 
vote on Jan. 20 with then-president Bates absent. Official minutes of the Jan. 
20 meeting, subsequently approved by the board, show that Bates was present for 
the entire session. The minutes reflect no such resolution being discussed or 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Zarilla is expected to tell the grand jury that the resolution does not appear 
in a master file that includes the originals of all resolutions passed by the 
board during its three years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial search of the files turned up empty last summer, a copy of the 
resolution was found filed among other city records, she said. Zarilla, who 
took over as city clerk last summer, said that it was not unusual for records 
to be misfiled.

DANA PARSONS: DESERTED AIR FORCE WIFE TELLS PENTAGON TO GO FLY A KITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he decided to trash the marriage after nearly 20 years, he traveled light. 
He went into the bathroom and tok his wife's razor. Nothing else. He left his 
clothes behind, not to mention his wife and four children. She got a telephone 
call from him sometime later from Nebraska, asking her to send him his 
overcoat. It was left to Gladys Ketterl, then 48, to explain to the kids that 
Dad had, shall we say, another agenda. 
</P>
<P>
That was 28 years ago, and you'd think the story would have pretty much run its 
course by now. Gladys Ketterl is now 76 and living in an Anaheim condo. She 
never remarried. The kids, who were 16, 14, 13 and 12 when Daddy had to fly, 
are now adults. 
</P>
<P>
But Dad was a career Air Force man, and that provides the backdrop for what's 
now happening to Gladys Ketterl. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a couple of years ago, about 75 Orange County women met somewhat 
regularly to discuss their common plight of being career military wives who 
were left in middle age or later by their husbands, most of whom remarried. The 
group has quit meeting, but a core of about 20 still stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
What separates these women -- most of whom are in their 50s, 60s or 70s -- from 
other abandoned women relates to the peculiar nature of the military. Because 
of the traditions of their particular generation of women and amplified by the 
itinerant nature of the career military life, those wives often didn't develop 
careers of their own. 
</P>
<P>
So, in the unfortunate cases when the marriages foundered, many found 
themselves on their own with no career track. The benefits they had been 
sharing with their husbands now were going to their ex's new wife. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Gladys discovered 28 years ago when the Air Force learned she 
wasn't an Air Force wife any more. She was required to surrender her ID card, 
which entitled her to a host of medical benefits and other perks of military 
life. 
</P>
<P>
We now fast-forward to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Gladys reapplied for the ID card, citing early '80s legislation that opened a 
small door for ex-wives of career military men. If she could show that she had 
been married for 20 years and that her ex-husband had 20 years of service, she 
could regain her ID card. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, she got a card. This June, it was renewed. Shortly thereafter, 
however, Gladys received a letter from the Air Force, saying she didn't qualify 
for the ID card because records showed that the marriage lasted only 19 years, 
9 months, and that her husband's career only lasted 16 1/2 years -- both 
figures falling short of the 20/20 rule. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage data, provided years ago by her ex-husband, is wrong, Gladys says. 
She has Nevada court papers showing that the divorce was finalized after the 
20-year mark. But even if that hurdle gets cleared, the Air Force still cites 
her husband's length of service of only 16 years and 5 months, at which point 
he was medically retired for a vascular condition. 
</P>
<P>
However, since he's been given full medical retirement benefits "as if he was 
in 20 years," Gladys says, his shortened term shouldn't be held against her. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Air Force is demanding that Gladys surrender her card. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is tripe. 
</P>
<P>
The indisputable facts are that Gladys was married to her husband for the 
entire length of his military career. That he abandoned her and the children 
after 19 years or that he was medically discharged after 16 1/2 years with full 
benefits shouldn't be held against her. 
</P>
<P>
Gladys has told the Pentagon just that. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I'd go to Leavenworth prison, but I won't give the card up," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Gladys Ketterl's case, this isn't a time for technicalities. It's a simple 
matter of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
At its core, it's a question of how the government treats the women who 
sacrificed right alongside their military husbands. If we reward the career 
military man, what about the military wife at his side, rearing his children 
and uprooting their lives year after year? 
</P>
<P>
Cara Lou Wifler, who headed the local chapter of Ex-Partners of 
Servicemen/Women for Equality (EX-POSE), said, "The difference between Gladdie 
(Ketterl) and other women her age is that she still has some fight left in her. 
I've met women who it (divorce after many years) impacted so severely that they 
never recovered. It's almost like being stripped of everything. After you've 
played this role where you stay home and take care of the kids and do the 
things expected of you, the thing that grinds on all of these women is that 
these men can go remarry multiple times and the military bestows all the 
benefits on the new wife, no questions asked." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon could make a discretionary judgment and let her keep the card, but 
Gladys isn't counting on it just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know the nasty things the military does," she says. "As long as 
my ex-husband was being given all those years of creditable service, I never 
got five cents. They never gave me or my children anything. When I ask them for 
help now, they're turning me down."

FINALLY . . . IT'S A BOY!;

<P>
CONTROVERSIAL SPERM-SEPARATION TECHNIQUE DELIVERS CLOSING CHAPTER IN IRVINE 
COUPLE'S SAGA

<P>
It is, in fact, a boy. 
</P>
<P>
The news, delivered last week with their fifth child, unleashed a flood of 
grateful tears from Gary and Jeanne Neumann of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Already parents of four daughters, the Neumanns had tried every known folk 
remedy to produce a son, resorting last December to a controversial 
sperm-separation technique at a Santa Ana fertility clinic. Ten months later, 
they are true believers in a method that purportedly helps parents choose the 
sex of their child. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do believe science did work for us," said Jeanne Neumann, 34. 
Following the birth Oct. 11 of Gareth William Neumann III at the new Irvine 
Medical Center, she said she and her husband "sobbed for hours. It was totally 
emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, she said, it is still hard to believe. "I have to stop and 
think: This is a son, not a daughter." 
</P>
<P>
In the little-known but increasingly popular method, sperm is washed to weed 
out chromosomes of the undesired sex and the woman is artificially inseminated. 
Critics contend the process cannot guarantee success, that science still cannot 
determine which of a multitude of sperm will penetrate any given egg. 
</P>
<P>
Since a Sept. 5 article in The Times, the couple has explained their motives 
and the process on two television programs: the Home Show and the Today Show. 
The Today Show included interviews with a couple who wanted a boy and 
considered abortion when they learned they had conceived a girl. The Neumanns 
turned away reporters for PM Magazine who wanted cameras in the delivery room, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fertility Center of Southern California in Santa Ana has 
received hundreds of telephone calls from couples hoping to choose the sex of 
their child. 
</P>
<P>
Half the callers were Anglos, and of them, a slight majority wanted girls, said 
director Herlinda Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the callers, mostly Indian and Asian, nearly all preferred boys, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Neumanns never attempted to learn the sex of their child during pregnancy 
and said they never would have considered abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Neumann said she believed she was carrying a boy, however, because her 
fifth pregnancy was different from the previous four. She carried the child 
lower, more in front, and was nauseated night and morning, rather than morning 
only, she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, at one point during her pregnancy, when she dreamed she had a girl and 
woke up in a sweat, Jeanne Neumann said she realized she was not fully prepared 
for another daughter. She said she knew then she had to work harder to persuade 
herself that they would be happy no matter what.

They decorated around the baby crib with both pink and blue.

If she had had a girl, she says, "She would have been loved like any other baby 
regardless of sex. This is a baby to begin with, a wanted child and the sex 
part was secondary." 
</P>
<P>
On further reflection, she says she is no longer sure she would have revealed 
to a daughter the lengths they went to to obtain a boy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she said this would be her last interview, partly because they do not 
want their daughters to think their place in the family is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
The girls are not resentful, she said. Tuesday they asked her to bring Gareth 
to class at Springbrook School, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But that is the last of his appearances for a while, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This baby will not be on TV. We don't want him to grow up with people saying, 
'You were a sex-selection baby.' We don't want him to be pulled out of a crowd 
like the first test tube baby. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want a quiet normal life, as quiet as it can be with five kids."

AIDS CASES, DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS has been a fact of life in Orange County since 1981, when the first 
resident case was diagnosed in November. Since then, 1,508 adults cases have 
been diagnosed (through June 30) and 938 of those people have died -- a death 
rate of 62%. 
</P>
<P>
A profile of the means by which county AIDS patients acquired the disease 
continues to show the overwhelming majority to be male homosexuals or bisexuals 
or intravenous drug users. And a look at how patients contracted the disease 
mirrors almost exactly deaths from AIDS. Here's a breakdown for both from the 
first cases through the end of June. 
</P>

PARKS PROPOSITION ENDORSED BY COUNCIL

<P>
The city is supporting a statewide bond measure on the Nov. 6 ballot that aims 
to improve parks, wildlife areas and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week voted to endorse Proposition 149, which would 
provide $437 million in bond financing to acquire and develop parkland and 
rehabilitate recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
City officials last year heavily lobbied legislators to qualify the ballot 
measure, which is "tailor-made for our city," Deputy City Administrator Richard 
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, if approved, would make the city a likely candidate to obtain 
millions of dollars in grants to help fund an array of projects, including 
reconstruction of the Huntington Beach pier, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would distribute $70 million among cities based on population, of 
which Huntington Beach would receive about $284,000. That money, however, would 
likely be "a drop in the bucket" compared to grants the city might receive from 
a separate slice of the bond proceeds set aside for projects based on merit, 
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the pier project, the bond may help the city pay for a plaza and 
expanded International Surfing Museum proposed at the foot of the new pier, the 
Linear Park planned to encircle the Bolsa Chica wetlands and two seaside bluff 
restoration projects, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the measure would earmark money specifically for ecological 
educational facilities, which the city is considering establishing at various 
wetlands sites, the Linear Park and the new pier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city may also be eligible for grants to help improve the Shipley Nature 
Center and hiking and equestrian trails in Huntington Central Park, Barnard 
said. JOHN PENNER

COUNCIL REVISES PARKING STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council adopted a controversial policy this week that will force some 
new businesses to provide more parking spaces for their customers but will 
allow others to provide fewer spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"In some areas we had overflow, but we also had businesses that were required 
to have more spaces than they really needed," said Councilwoman Patricia A. 
McGuigan. "This policy is to provide consistency between parking needs and 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere described by Councilman Richards L. Norton as "a three-ring 
circus," council members held a lengthy and often confusing debate over the 
proposed parking standards before approving them, 5 to 2, with John Acosta and 
Ron May dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
But further discussion of hotly contested portions of the new policy that deal 
with auto repair shops, dance halls, lodges, nightclubs and bars was postponed 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The new parking standards, which vary depending on the type of business, are 
all based on a building's gross square footage. 
</P>
<P>
For example, new restaurants will be required to provide one parking space for 
every 100 square feet of floor area. Restaurant parking had previously been 
determined by the number of its employees, business vehicles and seats. 
</P>
<P>
The new standards will be up for final adoption by the council Oct. 29. They 
would take effect 30 days later. 
</P>
<P>
The council deadlocked 3 to 3 when it first considered the entire set of new 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. abstained from the vote to avoid what he said 
was a possible conflict of interest. His family owns Ace Muffler Shop in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
But Pulido later joined a majority of the council in approving Councilman 
Daniel E. Griset's proposal to adopt all but the most controversial aspects of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Griset, who has led the battle for tougher parking standards, called the 
council's inability to pass the complete package "a step back." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young complained that the issue had been subject to "intense 
lobbying by people who do not want these standards on the books." 
</P>
<P>
"People are upset over the pattern of development in this city," Young said. 
"Our job is to take on the tough task of trying to set standards of the next 20 
years. We want to tell people in the community that we won't see the mistakes 
of the past." 
</P>
<P>
But Acosta, an outspoken critic of the new standards, said he believes they 
unfairly target specific businesses. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 17, the council approved new parking requirements for any residential 
dwellings built in the city in the future. GREG HERNANDEZ

MINISTER HELD ON SUSPICION OF PASSING BOGUS BILL; 
</P>
<P>
JAILING: THE PRESBYTERIAN CLERIC FROM SAN CLEMENTE WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSERTEDLY

<TEXT>
<P>
By all accounts, Ronald Shackelford is the last person one would expect to find 
languishing in a Tijuana jail. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford, a Presbyterian minister for 15 years and father of two children, 
"never jaywalks, has never gotten a traffic ticket," said his wife, Mary Lou 
Shackelford. "This is a good man. I don't think he has even played a bad round 
of golf in his life." 
</P>
<P>
As family and friends grow increasingly frustrated by what they call an 
innocent mistake, Shackelford spent his fourth night in a Mexican jail Tuesday 
for allegedly passing a counterfeit $100 bill while trying to pay a $1.75 toll 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all real tired and stressed out," his wife said. "We feel like a hostage 
family. It's a helpless feeling, but you just have to wait." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the San Clemente Presbyterian Church, where Shackelford has been 
associate pastor for three years, have enlisted the help of Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad) and the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana to seek his release. A U.S. 
official said he hoped to have Shackelford released on bail within the next 72 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford is the brother of former UCLA basketball star Lynn Shackelford. 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford's problems began Saturday morning when he and 22 church members 
were headed for the Welcome Home Orphanage located near the small town of 
Colonia Guerrera Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials say Shackelford, 46, stopped at the first of a series of three 
toll booths along the Tijuana-Ensenada tollway and paid the toll with a $100 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at the second toll booth about 15 miles down the road, Mexican 
authorities questioned him about the apparently bogus bill, then detained him, 
allowing the rest of the party to continue traveling. 
</P>
<P>
The church has hired a Mexican attorney to negotiate for Shackelford's release. 
The pastor has been visited by fellow parishioners every day since his ordeal 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Melia, a youth pastor with the church, said Shackelford is disoriented 
and confused by his surroundings but is in generally good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fine," Melia said. "He's mentally and physically tired, but it's awkward 
for him because he's never been in this position before. I think he's in a 
patient mode, waiting for justice." 
</P>
<P>
The main problem, say U.S. officials, is that the wheels of Mexican justice 
turn slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a holdup as far as Mexican authorities are concerned," said 
Glen Keiser, vice consul for the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana. "Under the Mexican 
constitution, one is presumed guilty until proven innocent. They can hold him 
for up to nine days before charging him." 
</P>
<P>
Keiser described a meeting between Consulate General Paul Klein and the Mexican 
chief of federal judicial police on Tuesday as productive and said the chances 
are "very good" that Shackelford will be released within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is a little unusual," Keiser said. "He's not your normal arrestee." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the church group, which was traveling in three vans, didn't find out 
that Shackelford had been arrested until late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked and dismayed," said Donald Bare, a member of the San Clemente 
parish. "But we knew he was going to a jail where he was not going to be abused 
and that the consulate was doing everything it could." 
</P>
<P>
The church has helped construct buildings and donated food at the orphanage 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Bare said he knows that many people in the community are angry over the irony 
of Shackelford being detained while on a charitable mission, but it won't deter 
him from going back to the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to go down again next week," Bare said. "We're unhappy that the 
wheels of justice go so slowly, but the need for Christian work down there is 
great. Most of us plan to be back at that orphanage."

ACTION POSTPONED ON SHOPPING CENTER

<P>
After a two-hour debate, the City Council on Tuesday night agreed to postpone a 
decision on a proposed 17-acre shopping center that some residents claim would 
obstruct their ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
The residents had appealed to the council to overturn Planning Commission 
approval of the controversial project by Shea Business Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the residents' appeal was valid but decided on a 3-0 vote 
to take up the issue at the next council meeting, Nov. 6. Mayor Patricia C. 
Bates abstained, citing a conflict of interest, and Councilman Larry A. Porter 
was absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center is proposed for the northwest corner of Camino del Avion 
and Street of the Golden Lantern and would include a six-screen movie theater, 
a restaurant and office space. 
</P>
<P>
The project had been approved 3 to 2 by the Planning Commission in August. 
</P>
<P>
Some 161 homeowners of the Bear Brand community had objected to the project, 
saying it would hinder ocean views and increase traffic in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of residents crammed the council chambers Tuesday night to plead that 
the project be scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Don Jacobson said the root of the residents' resentment was the 
1,600-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater has got to go," he said. "You're dealing with children who will be 
sleeping at a time when the theater will be at its busiest." 
</P>
<P>
Shea attorney Gregory W. Sanders said the residents presented "not one iota of 
evidence" to support their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Terry Dixon, however, disagreed. "I've practiced law too long not to 
know that there is sufficient evidence to find grounds for an appeal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting began resident Susan Penney delivered a notice of intent to 
recall Councilman Paul M. Christiansen. The recall notice stated that 
Christiansen has deceived the citizens and has not "been honestly acting to 
protect their best interests." 
</P>
<P>
Penney, who said she was acting independently, refused to be specific about her 
reason for the recall attempt. 
</P>
<P>
A recall drive was launched against the four other council members at the Oct. 
2 meeting after the council decided to delay putting a controversial ridgeline 
protection ordinance to a vote until another public hearing can be held. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Porter and Thomas Wilson voted for the delay. Mayor Bates and 
Councilman James F. Krembas abstained. Christiansen, the only member to vote 
against the delay, was not served with the recall notice at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
However, after being served with a recall notice Tuesday night, Christiansen 
said, "It looks like I'm part of the group again."

<P>
Environmental concern -- never before a big political item in this one-time oil 
boom town -- is the overriding issue in this year's city election. 
</P>
<P>
Ten candidates are competing for four City Council seats in the Nov. 6 
election, which also features two city ballot measures and a race for the 
elected position of city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-growth vs. slow-growth and protection of parks and beaches are among the 
environmental issues being debated by the City Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers say several factors led to this election being a focal 
point for environmental protectionists in Huntington Beach. The most notable 
was the Feb. 6 oil spill from the tanker American Trader, during which nearly 
400,000 gallons of Alaskan crude soiled the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor was the cliffhanger success of a new citizens' group in getting 
a parks-protection initiative qualified for the city's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill catapulted then-little-known Mayor Thomas J. Mays into the 
political limelight, ultimately leading to his successful bid in the June 
primary for the Republican nomination for the 58th Assembly District seat. The 
oil spill also brought the city national attention and focused attention on 
citizen-group efforts to save the city's wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The parks initiative, nurtured by the new group Save Our Parks, took months of 
grass-roots work. Measure C qualified for the ballot in a squeaker, after 
initially being declared short of enough petition signatures. The measure would 
forbid sale or lease of any parks or beaches without a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council majority, by a 4-2 vote, put a rival item on the ballot: 
Measure D, which would forbid sale of park and beach land without a citywide 
vote but would allow lease of those lands by a majority vote of the council. 
</P>
<P>
In the council race, Councilwoman Grace Winchell, first elected four years ago, 
is the only incumbent seeking reelection. Mays and councilmen Wes Bannister, 
the Republican nominee for state insurance commissioner, and John Erskine are 
not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell is a strong supporter of Measure C; she and Councilman Peter M. Green 
voted against putting rival Measure D on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and slow-growth advocates say they hope to reelect Winchell 
and at least two new council members. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Tomorrow and Amigos de Bolsa Chica, two major environmental 
groups, have endorsed three candidates: Winchell, former Planning Commissioner 
Mark Porter and Huntington Beach Union High School District President Linda 
Moulton Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell, Porter and Patterson oppose the proposed Pierside Village project and 
any other new commercial development on the city's beaches. They also oppose 
Measure D, which -- by allowing leasing with just a City Council vote -- could 
bring misuse of city beach land, they say. 
</P>
<P>
The other City Council candidates are former Mayor and Councilman Jack Kelly; 
former Police Chief Earle W. Robitaille; incumbent Planning Commissioner Edward 
G. Mountford; a Long Beach marine safety officer, Dirk Voss; George Arnold, a 
self-employed entrepreneur; Tony Passannante, a pharmacist and business owner, 
and Steven J. Roy, a carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Administrator Paul Cook's name will appear on the ballot, but he 
has withdrawn as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, Robitaille and Mountford all emphasize support for continued downtown 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he is worried about the "emergence of no-growth factions, which 
could retard public-safety levels and undermine (city) revenue flow." 
</P>
<P>
Mountford said he will seek a way to terminate the lease that allows oil 
tankers to unload off the city's shores. 
</P>
<P>
Voss and Arnold oppose new commercial buildings on the beach and criticize 
development decisions made in recent years by the council majority. 
</P>
<P>
Passannante supports downtown redevelopment and favors Measure D. 
</P>
<P>
Roy could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the City Council race, incumbent City Atty. Gail C. Hutton, 
first elected in 1978, is seeking her fourth term. She is being opposed by Paul 
Eugene Mann, a former law instructor at the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department's 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton said the main issue is her record of service, which she says has 
provided the city with "responsible and cost-saving legal leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Mann contends that Hutton has a poor record of service, that she is not 
respected by other city departments because of delays in processing legal 
requests and that she has spent too much money hiring outside counsel to 
represent the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about the money our city attorney gives away to outside counsel 
for jobs that should be done by the city attorney and her deputies," Mann said. 
"I don't think the taxpayers have any idea how much money is wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Hutton said that her department is among the most frugally operated in the 
county and that she spends relatively little money on outside attorneys.

Supporters of Proposition 140, which would limit terms of state officeholders, 
launched a "citizens campaign" Tuesday in Orange County to persuade voters to 
approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by a handful of backers, including Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove), proposition treasurer Lewis K. Uhler said at a news conference that 
"career politicians" will fight the measure to keep their office. 
</P>
<P>
"Most incumbents do not support it," Uhler said. "But what we need are new 
faces in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Uhler said he expects opponents of the proposal to wage an expensive ad 
campaign. By contrast, the campaign for Proposition 140 will consist of a 
grass-roots effort that relies heavily on neighborhood walks and local meetings 
to spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
Uhler led supporters in signing a pink placard that read, "Official Prop. 140 
Pink Slip to Elected California State Officials." 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which is touted by supporters as "The Political Reform Act of 
1990," would limit the terms of state senators and statewide officeholders to 
eight years in office. Assemblymen would be restricted to six years. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblymen John R. Lewis (R-Orange), Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and 
Pringle, plus State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), are among the Orange County 
legislators who support the measure, Uhler said. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who is completing his first term and is running against challenger Tom 
Umberg in the Nov. 6 election, said the measure would prevent "career 
politicians from running the state." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been people in the Legislature for 12 and 16 years," Pringle said. 
"That's getting carried away." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), the Republican gubernatorial candidate, 
endorsed the measure.

ACID SPILL ON ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY SLOWS TRAFFIC TO CRAWL

Morning rush hour traffic slowed to a crawl on the Antelope Valley Freeway in 
Newhall this morning after a spill of muriatic acid from a truck forced the 
closure of two southbound lanes, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Reese, 44, of Palmdale, the driver of the tractor-trailer truck hauling 
pool chemicals, was treated at the scene for inhalation of fumes from the 
spilled chemical but there were no other injuries, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer A. J. Torres said only about five gallons of the chemical spilled from 
the truck about 7:30 a.m. near the freeway's San Fernando Road exit. CHP 
officers and a Los Angeles County Fire Department hazardous materials unit 
blocked off two of the four southbound lanes on the freeway and the spill was 
cleaned up in about two hours, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
With motorists on the normally heavy southbound commute crowded into the two 
open lanes, traffic slowed to a crawl and backed up more than a mile. The 
southbound on-ramp from San Fernando Road to the freeway was also closed during 
the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said the spill apparently occurred when a pallet of muriatic acid 
containers shifted as the truck was heading southbound and several containers 
broke open.

A pedestrian believed to be a transient was killed early today when he was 
struck by a car on a section of Coast Highway that has been the scene of 
several similar fatalities, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The male victim was not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
He had been seen in a local bar shortly before the 12:30 a.m. accident, said 
Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, Jennifer Kawasaki, 16, of Laguna Niguel, was driving 
from work on Coast Highway, near Palisades Drive, when she struck the man. He 
was dressed in dark clothing and was crossing from a commercial area on the 
east end of the road toward Capistrano Beach County Park and the south end of 
Doheny State Beach, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki has not been cited. The accident remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, residents of the Capistrano Beach community have 
complained to officials that the dimly lit, sparsely populated stretch of 
highway, which parallels the Santa Fe Railway tracks, is a nighttime death trap 
for pedestrians misjudging the speed of oncoming cars. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a string of pedestrian fatalities, including the mid-1980s death of an 
elderly couple, residents four years ago successfully lobbied county officials 
to improve street lighting and to install a pedestrian bridge over the highway.

PROCRASTINATORS' CLUB 'HONORS' BUSH, CONGRESS FOR BUDGET MESS

When the Procrastinators' Club gathers to select its Procrastinator of the 
Year, it's usually difficult to make a choice. But this year, the club 
president said, there was no contest. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Procrastinators of the Year are President Bush and Congress for their 
inaction on the federal budget, said Les Waas, president of the Philadelphia 
group. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush and lawmakers were honored for "outstanding procrastination in 
making the current budget decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The club usually puts off making the award until well after each year ends, but 
Waas said this year there was really no question of who the honoree would be. 
</P>
<P>
Waas said the committee also got around to dispensing a piece of budget advice 
for Bush and Congress: 
</P>
<P>
"Spend the money first and then determine a budget later -- procrastinate until 
the money has been spent, because then the budget will always balance," Waas 
said.

HOUSE, SENATE REACH COMPROMISE ON DEFENSE BUDGET

<P>
In a major breakthrough on the defense budget, the House and the Senate agreed 
today on a compromise plan that would build no more B-2 bombers this year while 
slashing nearly $2 billion from President Bush's request for the Strategic 
Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The $289-billion military budget blueprint for the fiscal year that began Oct. 
1 came after nearly three weeks of bargaining and provided $18 billion less 
than Bush had sought in January. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key provisions are the wholesale cut in "Star Wars"; a worldwide 
troop cut of 100,000, including 50,000 in Europe, and a significant reduction 
in Bush's proposal for land-based nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also includes $403 million in research and procurement money 
for the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
has tried repeatedly to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators agreed to spend $2.9 billion on SDI, midway between the Senate's 
figure of $3.7 billion and the House's $2.3 billion. The compromise bill also 
calls for sharply scaling back the limitations the Senate had sought to impose 
on the way the Pentagon can spend money on various aspects of SDI. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise reached on the B-2 Stealth bomber allows production of the 
aircraft to proceed but is silent on future procurement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good news, bad news," said Rep. Ike Skelton (D-Mo.), a member of the 
House Armed Services Committee and a B-2 proponent. 
</P>
<P>
The House earlier adopted a defense bill that stopped production of the 
radar-evading aircraft at the 15 planes now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, in its legislation, approved the Administration's request for $5.1 
billion this fiscal year to buy two planes, for a total of 17, plus spare parts 
in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise calls for $4.1 billion for the Stealth program, including $1.8 
billion for research and development on the aircraft and $2.3 billion for 
procurement. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice told the House Armed Services 
Committee that the service needs $1.4 billion to acquire two B-2s on schedule. 
Rice said that without the money, acquisition of the two bombers would have to 
be delayed until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate must approve the package before it reaches the 
President.

Two American physicists and a Canadian who first detected the universe's 
tiniest known particles -- quarks -- and an American chemist who re-creates 
natural substances in the lab were honored today with 1990's final Nobel 
Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome I. Friedman and Henry W. Kendall of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and Canadian Richard E. Taylor of Stanford University will share the 
$700,000 Nobel Prize in physics. 
</P>
<P>
"Their discoveries are a breakthrough in our understanding of the structure of 
matter," the Royal Swedish Academy of Science said in its award citation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally overwhelmed, surprised and very honored -- all those types of 
things," Friedman, 60, said by telephone from Ft. Worth, where he was attending 
a symposium. "I never really thought of that as a real possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, 64, said in a telephone interview from Cambridge, Mass., that he was 
"overwhelmed" and had not expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Numb, I guess, is the closest word," said Taylor, 60, by telephone from his 
home on the Stanford campus near Palo Alto. "I certainly didn't expect it. It 
will probably hit me in a day or two." 
</P>
<P>
The $700,000 Nobel in chemistry went to Elias James Corey, 62, of Harvard 
University, for his work advancing the theory and methodology of organic 
synthesis. 
</P>
<P>
Corey in the 1960s developed "retrosynthetic analysis," a method of breaking 
down a natural molecule into its component parts to determine how it can be 
reassembled in the lab. 
</P>
<P>
"In this way, less complicated building blocks were obtained which could later 
be assembled in the process of synthesis," the academy said in its award 
citation. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, it said, Corey's achievement was to show how his method lent 
itself easily to computer programming, starting a process of computer synthetic 
planning that is "developing rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
The three physicists were cited for research more than 20 years ago that led to 
an explosion of understanding of the most fundamental nature of matter. 
</P>
<P>
Their work confirmed the existence of quarks, the building blocks used to form 
neutrons and protons. Those particles, in turn, make up the bulk of the atom, 
the building block of the molecule, the basis of all matter. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, Kendall and Corey are the sixth, seventh and eighth Americans to win 
1990 Nobel prizes. Taylor is the first Canadian to win the physics prize. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 awards, now all announced, will be presented to the laureates on Dec. 
10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of 
dynamite who created the prizes in his 1895 will.

A former church secretary wants $11 million from the Roman Catholic Church 
because a priest allegedly seduced her during counseling sessions and fathered 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie McCorvey, 34, alleges that Fernando Noe Guzman, formerly a priest at Our 
Lady of Fatima Church in Galena Park, engaged in professional malpractice and 
deceit by inducing her to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit claims diocese officials knew of a pattern of sexual misconduct by 
Guzman, knew he had sexual relations with a minor when he was assigned to a 
church in Navasota and knew he fathered two illegitimate children while working 
as a priest in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey claims Guzman assured her their sexual relationship made them "one 
with God." 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey was fired from her church job in 1987, and Guzman also left the church 
that year.

to the grounds beyond and thought it had a clear run," Basil Hughes, a 
researcher at the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust in Gloucestershire, said today. 
</P>
<P>
He said the thrush, about six inches long with a speckled breast, was probably 
blown off course while migrating from its summer home in Canada to South 
America.

RIVALS TRYING TO STEAL CUSTOMERS, AT&amp;T SAYS

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today accused rival MCI Communications 
Corp. and other long-distance companies of trying to steal its customers, but 
MCI said the problem was exaggerated and mostly honest mistakes by sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last six months alone, over 90,000 AT&amp;T customers have told us that 
they were victims of slamming," AT&amp;T Vice President Merrill Tutton told a 
House Government Operations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Slamming is changing a customer's long-distance service to another company 
without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Tutton said the actual number of switches without authorization was probably 
several times higher, because many customers did not know they were switched or 
did not complain. 
</P>
<P>
MCI Vice President Eugene Eidenberg admitted that slamming does occur but he 
said, "Let me state emphatically that the frequency of unauthorized switching 
has been grossly exaggerated by AT&amp;T. Much more common than the intentional 
switching by an inter-exchange carrier is a simple, honest mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Some customers said they were changed to another long-distance company even 
after they told telephone salespeople they did not want to switch. Others said 
they were switched without notification and did not find out until they got 
their telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
Market leader AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and other long-distance companies have been 
in fierce competition since the breakup of AT&amp;T five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has 70% of the nation's long-distance phone market, MCI 15% and Sprint 
10%. Smaller companies control the remaining share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the breakup, customers are allowed to choose the long-distance 
service they want and are billed through their local telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign urging those who 
changed to another company to switch back to AT&amp;T.

Illicit drug use by workers apparently is more common in Florida than it is 
nationwide, a survey released today by the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace 
in Washington suggests. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of the 501 full-time employees in Florida interviewed by the Gallup 
Organization said they knew of drug use by co-workers on the job, compared with 
only 24% of workers nationwide, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of the workplace drug problem in Florida, as identified by the 
workers themselves, is extremely troublesome," said the institute's executive 
director, Mark A. de Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, 45% of the Florida workers surveyed said they had seen or heard of 
illicit drug use by fellow workers before or after work, compared with 31% 
nationwide, the institute said.

High fuel prices are driving Australians off the road. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported today that September gasoline sales dropped 10% 
compared to the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Retail prices have jumped more than 30% since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug 2., to 
$2.45 a gallon from $1.95. 
</P>
<P>
Although Australia is largely self-sufficient in motor fuels, the government's 
policy is that even locally produced petroleum should be sold at world prices. 
This has led to widespread suspicions among Australian motorists that oil 
companies and the government have been profiteering at their expense. Both deny 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Resources Minister Alan Griffiths said, the government stands to lose 
about $468 million a year from its budgeted gasoline excise revenue if the drop 
in sales continues. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the sudden price rises have come as a shock for a country of 17 
million where people have been driving 21 billion miles a year just commuting 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
Car dealers say people are starting to bring in their bigger gas guzzlers and 
ask questions about the "economy" of smaller, more fuel-efficient models. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian branch of General Motors, Holdens, has put production 
on hold for its V-8 models, which had been in demand until recently. Ford 
Australia, which has the biggest Ford, the Fairlane, on its product list, also 
is reviewing its production schedules.

Coca-Cola Co. said today its earnings rose 9.1% to $394.2 million, or 58 cents 
a share, in the third quarter, compared with $361.7 million, or 51 cents a 
share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues increased to $2.8 billion from $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months, earnings climbed 12.5% to $1 billion, or $1.60 a share, 
compared with $967 million, or $1.36 a share last year. Revenues rose to $7.7 
billion from $6.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Third-quarter results were not as dramatic as the second quarter's, when 
earnings climbed 19.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, which made nearly 80% of its earnings abroad last year, said its 
international business continued to grow during the third quarter. The Pacific 
region led Coke's international sectors with a 23% growth in per-gallon sales 
of concentrates and syrups and a 16% increase in retail case sales. Gallon

Industrial production increased 0.2% in September, driven by a 7.5% boost in 
output of motor vehicles and parts, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected a slight decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said if the motor vehicle category were excluded, 
industrial production actually edged down last month. 
</P>
<P>
But the Fed also said output was stronger in August and July than previously 
reported. It revised a 0.2% decline first reported for August to a 0.1% gain. 
At the same time, it revised an unchanged July level to a 0.2% advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and 
utilities was unchanged at 83.6%. The operating rate measures not only output 
but also changes in productivity levels. 
</P>
<P>
Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods 
rose 0.2% in September, matching a similar gain the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the sharp rise in motor vehicle assemblies, manufacturing output 
dropped 0.2%," the Fed reported.

SOVIET HARVEST BOUNTIFUL -- BUT SO ARE LOSSES

<P>
The Soviet Union, facing widespread public unrest due to serious food 
shortages, had a record grain crop this year but tremendous losses occurred 
during harvesting, government estimates released today showed. 
</P>
<P>
An official at the State Statistics Committee put the harvest at 240 million 
metric tons, about 3 million more than the previous record in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The harvest was achieved despite bad weather and shortages of labor and 
transportation. Officials called out students, factory workers and even KGB 
forces to help bring in the grain. 
</P>
<P>
But losses still occurred. A senior Soviet agriculture official, speaking on 
television last month, said there was about 300 million metric tons of grain in 
the fields at the start of the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, the world's biggest grain importer, has been counting on a 
big crop to reduce its purchases on the world market. Initially officials hoped 
for 260 million metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, as bread shortages hit Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
accused farmers of holding back grain and ordered urgent action to make them 
hand it over. 
</P>
<P>
This year, purchases as well as harvesting were crippled by the general 
disintegration of the old controlled economic system, with many farmers hoping 
to sell grain on fledgling private markets or keeping more for themselves 
against future food shortages.

BASEBALL: THE BAY AREA EARTHQUAKE KNOCKED THE EX-DODGER OUT OF THE ROTATION FOR 
LAST YEAR'S SERIES. TONIGHT HE STARTS FOR THE A'S IN GAME 2.

<P>
Tonight, Bob Welch finally gets a World Series start for the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly one year ago -- Oct. 17, 1989 -- Welch was preparing to start Game 3 of 
the World Series against the Giants when an earthquake hit San Francisco at 
5:04 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Players from both teams scrambled to find their families and friends scattered 
throughout Candlestick Park. For Welch, it was even harder because his children 
were home with a baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you still think about now and then," Welch said last week. But 
he doesn't want to talk about it now. 
</P>
<P>
The World Series was delayed 11 days while the Bay Area recovered and Welch 
never got a chance to make his start. When play resumed, Dave Stewart and Mike 
Moore made quick work of the Giants to complete a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
This time, against Cincinnati, Stewart failed in Game 1 Tuesday night as the 
Reds routed Oakland, 7-0. Welch will face Cincinnati's Danny Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
When the rumbling finally stopped, life and baseball went on. The A's won their 
World Series and are now in a position to win another if they can recover from 
Tuesday's blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, who had a home heavily damaged in the Marina District, came back to have 
the best season of his career. 
</P>
<P>
He finished 27-6 with a 2.95 earned-run average and will probably win the Cy 
Young Award at the age of 33. It was the first time in Welch's 12-year career 
that he won 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the confidence growing in him," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa 
said. "He put all his pitches together this year. You can see by the look in 
his face that he's in command." 
</P>
<P>
Welch's 27 victories were the most for a pitcher since Steve Carlton won 27 for 
Philadelphia in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the addition of the forkball has made a difference," said Ron Hassey, 
who has been the starting catcher in 64 of Welch's last 66 regular-season 
starts. "It's gotten us out of a lot of jams this year. It has become a real 
good double-play pitch for Bobby." 
</P>
<P>
Welch first appeared in a World Series in 1978 when he struck out Reggie 
Jackson to end Game 2. But later in the series, Mr. October got even with a 
home run off Welch. 
</P>
<P>
Welch's focus in Game 2 will be on how to beat Danny Jackson, who also seems to 
thrive on postseason pressure. Jackson had his career year in 1988 when he 
finished 23-8 with a 2.73 ERA for the Reds after being acquired from Kansas 
City for shortstop Kurt Stillwell in a four-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
The last two seasons, Jackson has been bothered by recurring shoulder injuries 
and had a combined record of 12-17. He was sharp in September, however, and 
gave up only one hit in six innings against Pittsburgh to help the Reds win the 
NL pennant last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Lou Piniella bumped Tom Browning to Game 3 at Oakland on Friday so 
Jackson could pitch with his usual five days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
The A's power is mostly from the right side, and that could be a problem. 
Right-handers hit .271 with nine homers against Jackson; left-handed hitters 
batted .241 with only two homers.

SOVIETS BARRED FROM PORT AT AMERICA'S CUP

<P>
The Cold War has resurfaced in an unlikely arena -- the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new political climate of cooperation between the United States and 
the Soviet Union, a national panel in Washington has banned a Leningrad-based 
challenge syndicate from San Diego Bay, home to scores of U.S. warships and a 
secret submarine base. 
</P>
<P>
While the Soviet Union's Red Star syndicate will be allowed to compete in the 
1992 Cup regatta off San Diego, the edict by the Port Security Committee 
mandates the Soviets find berthing space in Mission Bay, away from major Navy 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is one of 12 American ports with sensitive military installations 
that remains closed to any Soviet-flagged vessels. The Soviet Union also has 12 
ports closed to U.S. ships. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep us out of their ports; we keep 'em out of ours," said Coast Guard 
Cmdr. Don Montoro, captain of the San Diego port. "It's a reciprocity-type 
thing. Things might change with the way the world is now and maybe this closed 
port thing will become a thing of the past, but right now it's government 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay technically is part of the restricted zone, but the Port Security 
Committee has extended a waiver to the Soviets for the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said the Soviet entry won't be permitted to enter San 
Diego Bay at any time for any purpose and that it should plan transits to the 
race course for practice and competition through Mission Bay's ocean access. 
</P>
<P>
The actual racing will take place outside the bay, several miles off Point Loma 
in the open ocean.

COLTS TAKE DICKERSON BACK INTO THE FOLD

Most of the Indianapolis Colts have accepted Eric Dickerson's return to the 
team. Now they want him to contribute to a team that may be on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson suited up Tuesday and took his first hits since last season -- one of 
them a "stunner" -- as the Colts practiced for Sunday's game with Denver. He 
was suspended for six weeks in the latest chapter in a nearly yearlong dispute 
with team management. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jack Trudeau, who has led the Colts to two comeback victories after 
the team lost its first three games, said the controversy and Dickerson's 
return shouldn't be a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody hated Eric," Trudeau said. "Everybody will put it behind 
them and give Eric a chance to make up for the things that happened. If he 
plays well, he can certainly help us." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Albert Bentley, who took Dickerson's place in the backfield, said 
he always knew there was a chance Dickerson would return. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys have accepted Eric back," Bentley said. "It's something we're 
all going to have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, for his part, said he sensed no tension or bitterness from the 
teammates he once trashed. But some of the offensive linemen, who took 
Dickerson's harshest criticism, weren't talking to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't nervous at all," Dickerson said. "Everyone thinks I have all these 
enemies . . . There are three or four guys I don't get along with, but there's 
45 or so others. Everyone thinks I'm a hated guy around here, but I have my 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts suspended Dickerson for conduct detrimental to the team and put him 
on the injured list in late August when he refused five times to take a 
physical to check the status of a hamstring injury he suffered in the 
off-season. Dickerson spent the last six weeks on the NFL's non-football 
injured list. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my life. I lead my life the way I see fit. Sometimes it turns out 
wrong," Dickerson said. "I know some of the things I said were wrong, some of 
the things I did were wrong, and I apologize. The only way I know how is to say 
'I'm sorry.' I don't know how else I can say it." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson who needs 11 yards to pass O. J. Simpson for sixth place among NFL 
rushing leaders, said he expects to be booed Sunday, but wants to put the 
controversy behind him.

Magic Moose put in a career effort Tuesday night in taking the $20,000 U.S. 
Harness Writers Trot feature by 3 1/4 lengths over his entrymate, Dear Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Pete Foley and driven by Ross Croghan, Magic Moose traversed his 
victorious mile in a lifetime best 1:56 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
That mile not only broke his track record for aged trotting geldings, it made 
him the fastest trotter in Los Alamitos history. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Moose tracked the pace-setting BH Dynamite down the backstretch, then was 
able to clear after a fast 1:27 1/4 three-quarters. 
</P>
<P>

Carly Simon's so vain. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old singer said she is trying to "come to terms" with getting older 
but acknowledged it has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"In five years maybe I won't be so attractive. People won't whistle at me on 
the street anymore," she said in an interview for the TV show "Personalities." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not above having those fears or apprehensions about losing my 
attractiveness, or whatever," Simon said. "Even though inside I know that 
sexuality is something to do more basically with who you are . . . than how old 
you are." 
</P>
<P>
Simon, whose hits include "You're So Vain" and the Oscar-winning "Let the River 
Run," said her fear of growing old started when she was about 26. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside me, there's a part of me, a little voice saying, 'Oooh, I wish I was 39 
again' or 'I wish I was 25 again,' or whatever," she said.

Bill Cosby has dropped a colorful mural shown during the opening credits of 
"The Cosby Show" in a dispute with a teacher whose Harlem students inspired the 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involves a mural painted on a Harlem building by students at the 
Creative Arts Workshop for Homeless Children, and a similar painting shown on 
the top-rated NBC series. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop's director, Brookie Maxwell, said the children who painted the 
original, "Street of Dreams," should get credit on the TV show and be paid if 
the idea is marketed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've ordered it taken off the show. It has nothing to do with the kids. Has to 
do with this woman, who is trying to hold us up," Cosby said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the principle of the thing," said Cosby, the highest-paid entertainer in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
NBC spokeswoman Rosemary O'Brien said three weeks of negotiations between the 
workshop and the show's producer, Carsey-Werner Co., had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"All we wanted was credit for the children," said Vivian Pollack, a lawyer for 
the workshop. "At no time did we make any specific financial demands, nor until 
last night did Cosby or Carsey-Werner offer any financial settlement."

LIZ SMITH: PUTTNAM FORESEES 5 BIG HOLLYWOOD MOVIE COMPANIES

"I'M ONE of the few people who've done what they thought in the back of their 
minds would be the ultimate within the role they performed, and discovered they 
were not very good at it. Both the Coca-Cola Co., then owner of Columbia 
Pictures, and I made extraordinarily tragic errors, but we made them for very 
good reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Thus spoke David Puttnam, according to Hollywood's "Dateline" columnist Steve 
Pond. If you don't exactly jump out of your skin over Puttnam's name, be 
reminded he was the British filmmaker who ran Columbia briefly and set the film 
community on its ear with his criticisms of Hollywood in general and a few 
huge-salaried stars in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Puttnam is making a "comeback." He is in the U.S. doing promotion for his new 
film, "Memphis Belle," a World War II flying saga that has all the earmarks of 
a sturdy hit. But the most interesting thing in this report is Puttnam's 
prediction of what's in store for Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
He says the Japanese company Matsushita will succeed in its effort to buy the 
entertainment giant MCA/Universal. With Columbia already owned by Sony of 
Japan, this will cause widespread alarm that Hollywood is being taken over by 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Puttnam predicts, Disney and Paramount will merge to create a huge 
American film company. In the end, Hollywood will consist of five enormous 
companies, only two of them based in the United States, and a handful of 
independent producers. They'll make all our movies. 
</P>
<P>
Gee, let's hope David Puttnam is wrong -- again. 
</P>
<P>
BRITISH BEAUTY Lysette Anthony has landed the juicy role of the witch Angelique 
in NBC's lush remake of that cult series of the late '60s, "Dark Shadows." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Curtis, creator of the original series, continues at the helm of this new 
version. Some of you may recognize Anthony from her recent roles in CBS' "The 
Lady and the Highwayman," or TNT's "A Ghost in Monte Carlo." And remember her 
1988 layout in Playboy? 
</P>
<P>
Ben Cross ("Chariots of Fire") will play the reluctant vampire Barnabas 
Collins. He is required to fend off the persistent sorceress, who just won't 
take no for an answer. (This is the role that turned Jonathan Frid into an idol 
of afternoon TV.)

Whoopi Goldberg believes actors should be able to play all roles, regardless of 
race or sex. 
</P>
<P>
"The part I played in 'Burglar' was written for Bruce Willis. 'Burglar' was his 
film, and he dropped out of it," she said in the November issue of McCall's 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, currently starring as the hotheaded, softhearted owner of 
television's "Bagdad Cafe," said, "That's why my Broadway show was so startling 
to some people, because I could do all those characters." 
</P>
<P>
Those characters included a white "surfer chick," a male druggie with a 
doctorate in literature and a 9-year-old black girl who lusts for long, blond 
hair.
